I said, a little nervously. "But I'm only in town today."</p> <p>"Of course," she said, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "We're not going to tell the little old me."</p> <p>She gave me a big kiss on the mouth, and a longer one. Our tongues intertwined, and I could smell the sexy perfume of her shampoo. We stood for a moment as she finished washing me, and I was about to go back to my hotel room and call her when she said, "I could get carried away with you!" She ran her hands up and down my body and cupped my buttocks, pulling me close to her, our erections grinding together.</p> <p>I pulled away and we kissed again, longer, more passionately. She put her arms around my neck and drew me in. It was a long and passionate kiss, and we came up for air to say something to each other.</p> <p>"Honey!" she said urgently.</p> <p>"Come on," I replied. We kissed again, this time a little longer. "But you got me all dirty!"</p> <p>"Oooh!" she panted under her breath. "I like it when you get it on." She kissed back, a little longer, a little rougher, just on the mouth. With her lips back to mine, she whispered, "How about we go somewhere a little more private? Let's get rid of these clothes."</p> <p>I felt the heat of her body on mine, her hand stroking my erection back to full erection. What a sexy little slut she was. I was going to like her! "Okay," I said, my heart pounding with excitement. "Let's go!"</p> <p>As we got near the water line and the car, I took her in my arms, kissing her deeply, almost bruising her lips with my kisses. She was wearing an elegant white sleeveless sun dress, and I could see she was braless, letting me see the cleavage of her breasts. We were about to head down to the water when her voice said, "I think we should go back over to the picnic pavilion where we can have some privacy."</p> <p>"What?" I asked, astonished. "You didn't mean..."</p> <p>"You mean we could have sex there too?" she asked, smiling at me. "I was referring to what happened earlier, before I got dressed!"</p> <p>That statement must have given her a rush of excitement, because I was really excited already. I'd been with her for several hours, and she'd given me such a delicious, exciting ride, it was wonderful. I took my mouth on hers for a last kiss, and she gave me one. "That was delightful, too," I managed.</p> <p>She smiled warmly at me, and kissed me again. "I wanted you to do the same tonight," she explained. "And I wanted to tell you that after I've finished dressing, I'm going to come and get the bottle of wine."</p> <p>"I'd love to," I said, my head spinning with excitement. "But I don't know what to do about the little girls."</p> <p>"You're going to get what you want tonight, baby," she said. And without waiting for my answer, she took my hand and led me toward the car.</p> <p>"That was a good one," she said, laughing. "We're going to have really good sex tonight. I think you'll like it! Maybe this little thingy that you've been wearing is just what you want for now!"</p> <p>I grinned and shrugged. "I like the way you think," I said. "I love the idea that you and I could make love."</p> <p>She kissed me again, and started the car. She slid onto the seat just a few inches back and started her favorite CD. I was still standing in the shade of the picnic table, holding on, waiting to be invited back to my suite.</p> <p>When she came back to the car, she leaned toward my ear. "Did you enjoy that as much as I did?" she asked, smiling.</p> <p>"Yes," I said, feeling the tension of the moment.</p> <p>"Me too, Baby," she said, turning to kiss me on the cheek. "Me too! But I know you want to stay, and to fuck a lot more before the week is up. That's okay. It's not like you've just been playing around now, are weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
