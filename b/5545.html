She replied with a smile.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I haven't been with anyone in five months." She grinned, knowing I could never find anyone who would love me as much as she loved me tonight.</p> <p>"How do you like me?" I ask, moving my hand to her face, rubbing it softly</p> <p>"I like you, baby. I don't ever want to leave you." She smiles and I can feel the softness of her tongue in my mouth as her head slides down to kiss my neck. I can feel her hot breath over the skin and hear the soft gasp that goes with the shiver of her body.</p> <p>"Do you know it wouldn't look nice if I had my back turned to you." I whisper to her.</p> <p>"I know exactly what you're planning," She grins, running her hand down to my hips and over my bare ass.</p> <p>"Yes, baby" I moan as two fingers slip in my pussy and she strokes it with her fingertip.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I let her know.</p> <p>"I mean, it would be awkward for me if you were here with anyone and here you are with me." She teases back, sliding her tongue across my lower lip.</p> <p>"I'm pretty sure. I bet you would want to get to know me." I kiss her, pulling her down to me.</p> <p>"Maybe, but I need to go get my bathing suit on," She smirks.</p> <p>"No way. I want to see you naked." With that I take off my T-shirt and throw it on the chair. I pull on my wet bikini and put on my blue satin thong. I grab my camera and flash it as I walk toward her. "What's up?" I ask, knowing it will only encourage her.</p> <p>"What do you think?" She smiles and turns to face me, giving me a mischievous knowing look.</p> <p>I watch as she walks over to her bag on the table. I can't wait to lay out my bikini. "I'm getting in the pool." I say, walking toward you. I look you straight in the eyes and take your camera from you. I know this will get you hot. I let you take the pictures for a photo of me. I make sure your picture is fully captured on the camera. I walk over and set my camera down, getting closer to you.</p> <p>"I think you like the show." I say with a sly grin. You reach into your bag and pull out a white bikini. I look at it for a moment and then look at you. "Do you like it?"</p> <p>"God yes. It's incredible!" You say, taking it, setting it on the table.</p> <p>"So, what makes it sexy?" I ask, trying to turn on your heat.</p> <p>"You know what I want." You reach and caress my ass.
