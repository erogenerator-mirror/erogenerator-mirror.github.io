"Yeah, well, he would need to show someone for the license as well." "So... what's the deal with the driver's license that you have? I'm going to have to ask him to show someone."</p> <p>"Yeah," she replied, "I have to pay off my debt. Okay? I mean, I don't want to do anything to risk our job... that's okay... I've got something to work with. I... err, I mean, I can't just..."</p> <p>"No-no... you'd be more than fine... we can be just as happy with whatever happens as you would be if you were there for the job. Okay? So if you want to call the cops later, now's the time. You owe me."</p> <p>"And that makes me feel better? It's true..."</p> <p>"I just... I haven't felt this way about anything since my dad. Like, well, it was just something a normal guy would do."</p> <p>"Hey... you're making me feel good." "I'm sure... and you are such a sweet guy." "Thank you."</p> <p>"Oh... uh..." Before he could finish, her phone rang, breaking the spell of the moment.</p> <p>She quickly reached into her purse.</p> <p>"Hello?" "Hey... there's a man on the phone waiting for you... sorry, actually, you're in luck. Just call him over."</p> <p>"Hi... man... you know my dad? Yeah, that's right... he asked if we were working tonight tonight and if I should show up, that's why... I told him I'll be there. Now... can that girl from the hotel come up on the stage?"</p> <p>"Hmmm... well... he's not married yet so..."</p> <p>"No, he doesn't even have an ex that he's with! I was hoping you'd show up and ask about that!"</p> <p>"I guess I'll have to do that..."</p> <p>She hung up the phone, then walked on stage. As she neared the stage, she saw his profile on the big screen. He looked very serious, but his voice was very friendly.</p> <p>"Hey, I know that you weren't with her at the party last night, but I have a question for you..."</p> <p>"Sure" I responded, " What's up?"</p> <p>"Well... as the guest speaker at the party tonight, I was wondering if you could get me a room at the same time... would that be possible?"</p> <p>"Sure... okay... the night works out..."</p> <p>She sat down on the edge of the stage. He reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet, and placed it in front of her. Once he had the wallet, he looked her right in the eye.</p> <p>"I'm not exactly a slut, is that it?"</p> <p>"No" she replied, " I've seen you go by yourself, and I'd be willing to take the opportunity to ask about how the evening started. But how about if I went and talked to your father, which I would, if I was invited?"</p> <p>"Oh... okay."</p> <p>"I... uh..."</p> <p>"I'll go and sit next to you on the stage."</p> <p>"Okay... fine..."</p> <p>He leaned in and whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"It isn't just you on the stage, is it?"</p> <p>"Maybe," she replied, "but he's not my father, anyway, you know?"</p> <p>"Well, okay..."</p> <p>He kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>"Goodnight, gorgeous lady..." as he turned to leave the stage, "Have a good night all."</p> <p>He gave her the same wave, then turned on the microphone and spoke.</p> <p>"Goodnight, beautiful ladies..." he paused and gave her a devilish smile. "Just a minute..."</p> <p>She felt very uncomfortable, so she looked over at the stage to make sure everyone had left.</p> <p>"Are you really going to talk to me, right in that position?"</p> <p>"Yes..."</p> <p>He put down the microphone and walked up to her, then reached down and took her face in both hands and pulled her face forward.</p> <p>"You are a beautiful woman, I can tell..." as he pressed a kiss to her lips.
