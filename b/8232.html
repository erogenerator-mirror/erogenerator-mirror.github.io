I say leaning back in a warm armchair. "How are you feeling?"</p> <p>"Better but I feel awkward around people who don't really know me."</p> <p>"It's okay. You're a person who likes to make your own decisions. It's your decision." I reassure her.</p> <p>"I'm sure I have seen the way I look at everyone from afar, in public. Everyone looks as if they own the company."</p> <p>"I know I didn't realize that before but I still think that's all that matters."</p> <p>"You look just like most other people. My kind are no different. I am always amazed by how much hair there is. The closest thing I can describe to how I look is pretty, but not like a girl."</p> <p>"You're right, I have hair as well."</p> <p>"My family has told me I look like a woman but there's also that weird feeling that you have to look beautiful."</p> <p>"It's really pretty, doesn't it."</p> <p>"Yes, it's beautiful but it's nothing that would ever put to shame."</p> <p>"Yes, it's beautiful. I feel like I'm the center of attraction in the world and in every interaction we go through."</p> <p>"I've got to say, you have a great body. I wish you would have told me all the work you did on your legs when my girlfriend was in the pool, I would have been her. "</p> <p>"I can't argue with that. Now let's watch some more movie."</p> <p>"Sure, sounds great."</p> <p>After that, we made our way to the theater. We were sitting next to each other, but not touching each other, and we were both still feeling shy. I looked at her with those blue eyes and she smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you, I haven't felt this comfortable around anyone in years. "</p> <p>"Me neither," I said, laughing.</p> <p>"This place is pretty nice." I smile at her. "Would you like to go see something?"</p> <p>"Why, let's see the 'movie'?"</p> <p>I smile as we walk into the theater. Before we sit down in the far corner, we are shocked when the screen goes blank.</p> <p>"Damn, I wish we had a good theater to watch."</p> <p>"Can I get you anything?"</p> <p>"No thanks."</p> <p>As we approach the screen, I turn towards her. I grab her hand and pull her up. "Let's go for a walk, I have some questions I want you to ask."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"First of all, why are you doing this to me?"</p> <p>"I'm feeling insecure around you."</p> <p>"Is that it?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry but I just don't want to lose you. The thought of losing you has gotten me a bit excited."</p> <p>"You never cease to amaze me about that."</p> <p>There was no need for the statement.</p> <p>We stroll back to the parking lot, hand in hand. As we walked, I looked over at her and saw the same feelings I had back. I am sure I gave a lot of stares.</p> <p>"There is a great place to eat there. You can watch the movie while you eat."</p> <p>"No, it's not good enough."</p> <p>"Why not, do you love being with me?"</p> <p>"That's the question." I am determined not to push it.</p> <p>"I love being with you; don't you love being with me?"</p> <p>"I can't say that I really love it in that way."</p> <p>"You can't make me say it in front of a group of people. You can't give me away like that. You might have made your choice."</p> <p>"I didn't mean you could. I wanted to tell you I couldn't do this with you. I had no reason to do it. It's not something I would want to do."</p> <p>"I'm sure it will not be your decision to make but you don't have a choice either. You could have made your choice if you were forced to. I understand that. You are doing the right thing."</p> <p>"You're right. But is your decision going to be made soon?"</p> <p>"We're leaving tomorrow morning and I'm going to be working from home this Friday to be there for you."</p> <p>She took my hand and walked me out. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>As we walk back to our car, I give her a kiss on the cheekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
