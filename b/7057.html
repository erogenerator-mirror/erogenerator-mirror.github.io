She had taken the evening off work so she must have just gotten home from a date on the coast. The house clock was just ticking and I didn't have time to check it out, so I just let my mind wander until she called and we exchanged some small talk to keep me in the mood.</p> <p>We talked for several minutes and I didn't even feel guilty. I just wanted her bad. I needed to be there to see her. I hadn't been able to come up with anything to say for the past month. We said we would call and see each other when we could. I was surprised at how quickly it occurred to me that maybe I just didn't get this chance before I was.</p> <p>I took my car out of my garage and drove down to the pier. I saw Katie's house and went in to park. I was almost to the house on my way there. The sound of the waves came up to greet me. I took a deep breath and looked around the pier. I made my way to Katie's front door and rang the bell. She pulled it open and led me to the bedroom. She walked me straight to the bed and asked me to undress. While I was undressing she got one of the candles lit. I felt the room get warm and my heart rate increase. I took off my clothes. Even then I had to be concerned about the amount of water I could easily get into myself.</p> <p>Kathy opened the door and saw the bed and knew that I was naked. She handed me a towel on that I used to dry my hair. "That's a first for me. You don't take your time do you? You come in and get on the bed and I will dry, make us breakfast and then we can be on our way." She said this and with that went to get the light robe on and a couple of other things that she had brought for me. I sat back on the bed and watched her get dressed. She was wearing a white tank, short shorts. I couldn't help but stare at her. She smiled and said that she wanted to go into town. I didn't understand but thought that it may be a good idea. She took the robe off and laid it on the chair. She looked at me with an almost child like expression on her face. "I will let you know when I come back." She said. The last sentence brought a smile that I hadn't seen before.</p> <p>I watched her leave, wondering if she had noticed me standing there watching her. She walked over to the window and looked outside. I didn't want to stare at her just then, but I couldn't help it. She walked over to her bed with me and placed her hand on my cheek. "Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you and won't think anything." She said. I just nodded and smiled. We had a good conversation about what had happened and about ourselves. After our talk I decided to just lie back down and wait for my heartbeats to slow down, but I was pretty sure that if I just sat back on the bed and thought about it, I would get another erection, maybe even a hard on from watching her.</p> <p>We talked a lot and she asked me questions that I couldn't answer to my satisfaction. She never put the past in front of me and I was glad. I felt that we had been lovers many times before and she wasn't making any move to have sex with me. It wasn't really a romantic thing. She wanted me to be happy and I did my best to make her happy. Finally I asked her if she wanted to go to her room to change clothes or a nice restaurant if she wanted. She said that she would be glad to go because she had something to show me when we got back.</p> <p>I told her that I needed to get ready because I was going downstairs and she wanted to meet me shortly. She gave me a knowing smile and headed down the stairs.</p> <p></p> <p>I waited the whole day for our phone call. I started thinking about what she had said about something that she and Brian had talked about. I had a bad case of the butterflies again, when my heart rate suddenly spiked again. Maybe it was the butterflies from watching her and thinking about them. But, being that she had been on the phone for about 20 minutes to talk to me, and I was alone in her bedroom with her phone number, so I really didn't care.</p> <p>I got to her floor about 11 a.m. and waited. After awhile I realized that it would be just minutes, maybe 5 minutes. It was the middle of February, that was still warm enough to actually see the light. I stood on the doorstep, hoping that it was just her, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
