She frowned.</p> <p>"Just thought you'd want to know." He said.</p> <p>"Uh, um, about that..."</p> <p>"Just don't be mad." He chuckled. "There will be other times." He smiled. "I'll pick you up tomorrow, just hang out. I'll be back here. We can discuss what's happening here between us. I understand that my brother is always upset when he has a new girl for the first time, but..."</p> <p>"Well," She said, "I don't want my family to just put an onus on me."</p> <p>"That's fine. I understand. It's just that..."</p> <p>"Is there anything we should know about?"</p> <p>"Well," He said, "we know that our friend has a little girl who he thinks will stay with him for years and that she'd be perfectly happy without him."</p> <p>"That doesn't surprise me. He's the father. But then I don't have a baby."</p> <p>"You have your child. My sister has hers. You can't have both."</p> <p>She sighed. "I know. So what do you say about that?" She said.</p> <p>"I was wondering if you'd be able to carry the child in your arms. We're doing some tests for both of you and, well, you've already proved your love to me."</p> <p>"Honey, I love you." She said.</p> <p>"Love? What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Love is the same thing as love. Love has no real meaning, nothing that is, to me, beyond our love making."</p> <p>"I still don't see it." He laughed. "I mean, you've only met your first child once."</p> <p>That made her smile. She could love him. "Don't you know that you have already had only one girl?"</p> <p>He shrugged. "I'm not sure why we never even mentioned it. I suppose I'm the exception."</p> <p>"And yet you want it." She said. He looked at her.</p> <p>She wanted it, yes. He made her want it.</p> <p>"Can you do that for us, honey?"</p> <p>"Of course. We can have it." She blushed.</p> <p>"I think you've got something of a gift there with your ability to love."</p> <p>She smiled. "Thanks. Well, if you need any help about your baby, I can pick you up tomorrow.</p> <p>He nodded and walked to the door. She followed.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"So, you're a little preoccupied." She smiled. He was standing in front of her. "Now you'll have a little time."</p> <p>He grinned. "I don't know about that."</p> <p>She laughed. "I want you to come back here. I want your heart. We want you. Now." She pulled out her cell phone from her pocket. "Phone sex, phone talk. Now."</p> <p>"I am." He said, "but I don't have a phone here."</p> <p>"I have a phone here." She pulled up the list. Her phone. She loved it there. She loved him. Now. "We'll talk."</p> <p>She took the phone out of his hands, and handed it to him. "Phone sex is where I want you." She put the phone on his head, "And now." She lifted her finger to his lips and walked out of the room. "Is there anything you need?"</p> <p>"No." He stopped her. "I'll see you."</p> <p>"I'll try to be there if I can help." She grinned when she closed the door behind her.</p> <p>"I'll help you. Come back."</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Where is it we're going for lunch?"</p> <p>"There isn't anything else that can be arranged there."</p> <p>"Okay." She sighed. "That's probably true."</p> <p>"But it's the first time we've done lunch together."</p> <p>"I know. I know that. But I don't think it's the last time we'll have lunch together. And... we can do something now."</p> <p>He sighed. He didn't realize how hard he'd worked to keep her happy, but it was a big dealâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
