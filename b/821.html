I’ll tell you what you must do.”</p> <p>I grab her by her neck and turn her around so she can see herself in the mirror.</p> <p>“Don’t be afraid. You can do as you like but if I do, you must do what a woman tells a man to. That’s how a good husband should show love.”</p> <p>“Yes, but what if your lover catches you looking through the mirror.”</p> <p>“But that won’t help you any. You see there is nothing to hide. Your husband is a well behaved and honest person.”</p> <p>I push her up against the desk and undo her jeans. She is wearing a pink pair of panties. Her nipples are fully erect and erect. I move to the side to allow her to take the panties off, but you have now seen her entire pussy.</p> <p>“Take the white cotton ones, honey. They are very sexy.”</p> <p>She takes them off and I remove the bra. I then slowly, slide the panties down her legs and step out of them. I then reach for her panties and start to take them right off. I am very nervous. She has her legs together as she looks at me.</p> <p>“Not so fast, honey. Your panties should stay on for a little while. Here take them with you.”</p> <p>“Oh I don’t think I can. Please don’t do this. I can’t take them off now.”</p> <p>“It is okay darling. I love seeing you naked like that.”</p> <p>She lifts her arms as I slip hold of the panties. She shivers a little as I lift them and she does not pull them at all away. I take hold of her wrists and place them behind her back.</p> <p>“You had better relax darling. It is very important not to fight you as she will give you a hard spanking.”</p> <p>I am sure that I am making her more excited than before. There she is bent at the waist looking at me in the mirror. I take her hand and place on the seat of the chair for her to move the chair forward.</p> <p>“Let me try to help.” I ask. She nods her head, indicating her acquiescing with her eyes. As I pull her back by her chin and kiss her deeply and gently, she starts to relax. I am very excited and it causes my dick to become erect, but it still has a light covering of blood. I take my hands and reach up for her breasts. I gently cup their soft softness in my hands. I feel her nipples becoming more and more erect. I begin to knead them, making them erect as they are pushing in their way against my palms.</p> <p>“This feels so good,” she says. “Thank you.”</p> <p>“This is my way of thanking you for loving and loving me. It is more than loving but more than that. And my pleasure is all my pleasure you have given me.”</p> <p>I am very proud of myself, but I know that this is not in a bad way. The fact is that my joy at seeing her naked body with my hands are all my joy at seeing her fully naked and having an emotional attachment to her. I enjoy her company immensely. It is my joy that she will be completely available to me and that her naked body will be absolutely available to me.”</p> <p>“Well, that does not surprise me. You have been very kind to me and I can be very kind to my husband.”</p> <p>“That I can promise.”</p> <p>“Do you remember something, that I said the same way for you.” I ask her.</p> <p>“Oh yes, I think I remember.”</p> <p>“Would you like to, a.k.a. yes, please, if I take on her part of the duties?”</p> <p>“Yes that would be lovely,”.</p> <p>“Would the work for you be very important?”</p> <p>She smiles and says: “Of course.”</p> <p>“Do you want me to put on her lingerie so that you can watch me undress her?”</p> <p>She nods her head emphatically.</p> <p>“Of course I want a special treatment if I can get her to wear sexy underpants that show her most intimate parts.”</p> <p>“Of course I will have access, please.”</p> <p>“You can open the front if you want but you must hold on to—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
