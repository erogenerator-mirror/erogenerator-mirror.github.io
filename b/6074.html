"On two legs," he told them.</p> <p>He didn't have to be said twice.</p> <p>"On one leg," the women told him.</p> <p>He got on two legs. It was too uncomfortable yet he was able to slide into each of them. He thought a split second of this, it was better than a full-fledged dick! He started to feel dizzy, and he got that feeling that he thought he was in for a life of pain. He was getting his mind back on the job at hand! he thought. He was feeling dizzy, and his dick felt good. If he could do it again, it would be better than before.</p> <p>He thought about his cock but he had to admit, he wasn't quite as good as the guy in him. Maybe they were just a little shorter, more muscular, but his equipment was more like a pair of football players than men, maybe they were all over six feet maybe, or about three or four. There was the thing about size, it never failed to make him feel good. Maybe it was just the fact that he was able to fuck a woman without the fear of pregnancy, he didn't really care, or maybe he was just that kind of prick who would take over from a women who had to fight him off or she might be able to take him if he came before her, he wasn't sure, but something in him told him that he had to resist. He hoped that their reaction would make him better than him, maybe that would encourage him to think about it.</p> <p>"Okay, if you all can do it that way, that's good. But if you've done worse, then we all have to give it a rest. We'll call it a night. Here's how it worked. We'll help each other. I feel like an old friend, and since you have all done pretty well, it would be my job to share with you what a guy has got to offer!" she said.</p> <p>As always, there was that look in her eyes, that look of desperation. He could tell that she was excited about something, but he was more prepared to say no. The two women got up off the desk, and each took a hand. "Come here," he heard her say.</p> <p>He walked closer to the desk, and they lifted him up on his hands and knees. "Lift up, and take your clothes off. We're going to do something for you."</p> <p>He could feel his heart race, and his dick felt good, he wasn't sure if it would work with what they had in mind, or if it'd only be a few hours. It was very hard to feel guilty though, and he felt that it would be best to go with what they had in mind. He could feel their faces just a few inches away.</p> <p>"Okay?" they said.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "But don't be embarrassed."</p> <p>Both women laughed. He waited in excitement until they started removing their clothes. His dick was sticking straight up, and he couldn't help but think how proud it would be at the sight of those women, all beautiful and ready to be fucked. He felt an erection.</p> <p>The two women began kissing and touching. Her lips were soft and pink, and her tongue was more insistent. He felt her hand moving his pants down. He watched her big, round, white ass as her hand moved under the cotton skirt, and he imagined her hand pulling down her panties. He felt her hand move down his pants and begin feeling. He felt her hand slide under his boxer briefs. He was amazed that it felt so smooth, no jiggle, no bump. But it didn't feel as awkward as it had before. His dick began to throb.</p> <p>He got an erection that was not going away. He watched her mouth on his dick. She looked as if she were going to suck him, but instead she seemed to be looking for something. His eyes fixed on her lips and the way her tongue rubbed the tip. He could see her fingers pushing back through the soft blond hair. He could feel the heat of her mouth, and he could feel her lips slide down the head of his cock and touch his balls. He wasn't completely sure, but when she took him in her mouth, it sent a shiver up his body. He felt it was almost as if he had a dick. He moaned, and she began to slide her tongue down his shaft. It slid to the back of her throat and she started to hum. It made him feel like he had a soft penis, almost soft. It was like she was a man and a woman, and she was licking his dick with her lips while still on her knees.</p> <p>He saw her hand moving her panties down and then feeling the flesh of her pussy. Her fingers were wetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
