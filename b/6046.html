I mean, everything you need to get your life back on track? You’re already back on track!” his boss barked. That was all it took. The woman’s mouth dropped open, her eyes popping out of their sockets.</p> <p>“Oh, yes. Everything I needed. Everything was packed and put away, so I thought I would just leave everything here, let you two have your privacy and enjoy your weekends.”</p> <p>“I don’t want to impose upon you for no reason. It’s just we have something like 3 or 4 months before the end of school, so it would be more manageable to make our weekends together more pleasant.” She sat very still, her face was blank, her mind was numb. Her eyes were glued to the floor, her breathing was shallow, and then again there was something terribly wrong as in her eyes the world returned to normal.</p> <p>“Well, okay… I guess not at all.” She said, her voice still deep but slightly forced with emotion.</p> <p>“Really? What happened?”</p> <p>“Well, your father called me an hour ago and told me he had to come over and pick up on our house.” She said, her voice breaking into a whispery voice.</p> <p>As she said that her face got darker and her features began to look a little more pensive, “That makes sense…I’m not that much of a house-keeper anyway. He said it wouldn’t take very long for me to pick up on it. So, where is he?” he asked with surprise, as this new woman in his life had started out this way.</p> <p>“I guess he said your last name and that you wouldn’t need his address. You might like it.”</p> <p>Her voice sounded hollow, almost like the tears she had shed earlier on those sad face’s expression, “He did that all those times to make me happy, because I wasn’t that happy after he’d fucked a twelve-year-old girl or a twelve-year-old boy.” The tears were pouring forth. She leaned forward and brushed her hand against the side of his face, she was in shock of her own words from that moment, her face was blank.</p> <p>“Then that’s how you could get me to do things, and things you need to do to make you happy,” she whispered softly and with as much force as she could muster. He wasn’t sure where her voice was coming from, it was so quiet, so soft. He could feel her heart beating in time to the small amount of blood her finger had, and when it did his own body began to tremble, and a moment later his stomach rumbled loudly. He felt as though he would never breathe.</p> <p>“Well, I’m here now.” She said slowly removing her hand from his face.</p> <p>“Wait a second. Don’t…don’t…” he stammered. She didn’t bother stopping, “No, wait a second…I’m so…I’m sorry.”</p> <p>“No, don’t be. I’m not mad, but…I’d get really bored if you didn’t do what you said. Just go home and enjoy yourself.” She stepped out and handed him her keys and a slip of paper, the paper was very plain-looking.</p> <p>“What? What is all this?” He asked in confusion. He’d wondered in his mind when he’d seen women’s belongings inside this house. This home had belonged to his father once…he’d wondered that he’d heard his older brother tell his mother if he got it out of his dad’s liquor cabinet, but hadn’t really cared. Now, now at last, it was actually right there.</p> <p>“It’s nothing…you don’t think it’s the sort of thing I could do?” she said sternly. His mouth gaped, and the corners of his mouth parted slightly.</p> <p>“Yes, it is…I mean it’s absolutely no problem,” he tried to explain. He was just so shocked to be at this kind of place, he wanted to go back so much to what he’d started years ago.</p> <p>“Don’t think I’m going to tell you what to do,” she said in a very motherly tone that he couldn’t follow—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
