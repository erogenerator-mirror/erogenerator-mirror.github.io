I just wanna see for myself."</p> <p>"If you're so busy, I'll just come."</p> <p>"No. I'm serious. I'll go."</p> <p>We kissed like that as the breeze swirled around us, the scent of the sea so warm and lovely. She leaned back against me again, and I held her, and then ran my fingers through her moist hair as our kiss became deeper. She lifted herself up and laid down next to me, and she began to trace circles with her fingers on my chest. I rolled over to face her again, and her lips brushed mine, and it was heavenly. She drew us together again, and I took her as one. I wanted to be anywhere but in her, but she had other things in mind. I was all ready to take it from the start. I rolled on top of her, pulling her on top of me again, until she was on top of me again, and then she was back on top of me, kissing me again, her kisses getting longer as she kissed me more confidently. She kissed me from my nose up to my lips, then back down to my mouth, and all the time she was doing this, she was going slow and deliberate as she kissed me. My hands explored her all over, sliding over her skin wherever I could reach. She was smooth and warm, as she was every inch of her. Our kisses grew deeper. She was so wet and I felt every little bit of it in her, and I could feel how excited she was. She was going to get another orgasm quick.</p> <p>"Baby I'm gonna cum," she gasped.</p> <p>"Mm. Cum for me. It's yours now. I want to feel all that cum."</p> <p>It was too much. Her pussy clenched around my cock and I gave her everything I had. I began to move on her, slowly at first, and I took my time and enjoyed it too. I moved my hips in slow little circles, and she responded with pleasure and passion. I could see the look in her eyes. She was absolutely gorgeous with all her naked, beautiful skin, and there was nothing that could stop that. And then the last image I saw was her staring me down as she climaxed. Even my own eyes betrayed this, but they were filled with love and adoration. We kissed again as I went off and into her mouth, and her eyes closed in a loving sigh. I could feel and then feel her heart as it beat out in waves against mine. We were one. The kisses had lasted forever, but somehow it was the most intense thing that could ever occur to our souls. We were one. Finally, slowly, we got dressed and left together. We kissed our way back to the beach as soon as we got our clothes on and got back to the room. I lay back on the bed, and she climbed on top of me and pressed my hips to hers, and I held her there and watched her, wondering whether I was going to fuck her again in the same way we had. She was beautiful. I couldn't quite understand it, but I knew she loved me. She just seemed to know what to do with me. We did the best we could. We made sweet love for the rest of the night.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p> <p>The next morning we slept together naked in bed. She curled up next to me, and we kissed.</p> <p>"How was it?" I asked her.</p> <p>"So," she said with a smile, "It was nice."</p> <p>"We'd better make a list."</p> <p>"We'll see," she said with a shrug, "and when we do, all I want to do is tell you how much I love you."</p> <p>We had another baby when we made love that dayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
