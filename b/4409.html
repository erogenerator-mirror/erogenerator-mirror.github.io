"What are you thinking," she asked.</p> <p>"I would love to put you two together and just fuck you," John said. "The idea of you two together is really sexy," he told her.</p> <p>"I think you really want to do that," Penny said, sliding her lips down his huge cock.</p> <p>"Do you," he asked, pulling her head away from his cock.</p> <p>"I thought it would be really sexy," Penny said, sucking him in again. "I was hoping you would try. I really wanted to feel you again tonight. I wish you were here with me when I do this with you," she said, her lips wrapped around his shaft.</p> <p>"I want to take you home with me," he told her.</p> <p>"That'll be good." Penny said, her lips sliding up and down his shaft. "Do you really love me," she asked.</p> <p>"I love you, Penny," he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>He pulled Penny up to kiss him as her firm body was squeezed between him and the sofa next to them. She could feel his hard cock pressed hard against her. She could feel him hard against her lower region.</p> <p>She knew exactly what she wanted. She wanted him. She was sure that this would be the night, just once, that night, when he was hers.</p> <p>She knew Penny was right. She had planned to call him every day since school. She knew that by Thursday things would change between them.</p> <p>He wanted to take Penny home with him, to fuck her at least once more, to make sure she got the right kind of loving. Penny knew exactly how he wanted to do that.</p> <p>She could feel him pressing against her bottom. It hurt! The pain in her butt could be felt even when he took her.</p> <p>"I'll see you around," she said to him, pulling away from him slightly.</p> <p>"Bye," he said, not moving his fingers from under his balls, which he had been resting on her bare belly.</p> <p>"See you tonight," she added, sliding back against his body. "I've always been yours, John. So you may have the choice of using the word pussy, or fucking pussy," she told him as she slid back and then back against him.</p> <p>John pulled away from her, kissing her on the lips. The kiss led to a long, slow lingering exchange of tongues as they kissed. Each of their mouths knew the other's body intimately. Their bodies were pressed against each other, their breasts pressed deeply against one another.</p> <p>Their bodies pressed against each other as the kiss ended. They were both hot and excited, flushed with desire. The kiss deepened. The kiss became more intense. They kissed and sucked their wet mouths together, and their lips pressed hard against each other's.</p> <p>They stood locked tightly and pressed their bodies together, rubbing their hard, throbbing cocks against one another.</p> <p>"I love you, Penny," John whispered in her ear as he moved a finger to tickle her clit.</p> <p>"I love you too, John. I just want to hold you," she told him emphatically as her fingers stroked his soft, silky hair.</p> <p>Their next fuck at that point was nothing more than a short session of hard sex as they continued to kiss. John was the first to cum. He took Penny home with him as his hands were busy with the insides of Penny's warm thighs and thighs. Penny, sitting on the sofa beside her husband was waiting for his cock to explode out of his pants.</p> <p>John was not to be denied. He pulled Penny away from the sofa and walked her to the kitchen counter. They stood kissing as his hands squeezed and felt the soft flesh of her round, rounded bum. He pulled away and walked backwards through the house before grabbing her by the waist to sit her on the edge of the back patio.</p> <p>He sat her bottom against the edge of the patio while he reached forward and put his hands on her thighs. He parted her thighs and his hands explored her soft flesh. He slipped one thumb down the inside of her thighs and then over a hot, hard nub. His thumb circled her clit and it came up to meet the palm of his hand.</p> <p>Penny's knees got weak. She was getting hotter as John's hand stroked her clit. Her wetness was building. Her pussy was tight and hot. She could feel her legs trembling.</p> <p>She pressed against the sofa's back while taking a deep breath. She knew her body was going to be cumming as she had just been fucked inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
