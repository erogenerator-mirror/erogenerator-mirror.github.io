They were not a big help at all. In no time our attention was drawn back to the story.</p> <p>Dad was sitting at the table when they came back into the kitchen.</p> <p>"This is your mom?" my dad asks, "I know you two have your little game but I can understand why you have gone off and left your friends behind. Did you enjoy our little fun?"</p> <p>"No," mom stammered, "what's with all this drama? It's not like we don't all have each other."</p> <p>"That's right," Dad says sarcastically, "because you were out of the house with them before we knew they were your friends. And they weren't out of the house for long!" He points towards the basement. "You can go anywhere you want because we're not allowed to touch any parts of you," he points to their school uniforms "and get whatever you want!" My dad leans over and whispers, "you know that can't happen after school is over."</p> <p>As we walked back upstairs, we both started laughing and saying how much we enjoyed the game.</p> <p>"What do you think?" my dad asked mom. "It was definitely fun!"</p> <p>"Yeah, but how about you guys? You can't mess up your school uniform! It's not going to look good on you any time soon," my dad says as he leans over the counter. We both start laughing again.</p> <p>"You guys have really turned out good! You guys are the most fun I've had," my mom said.</p> <p>"You did well yourself!" my dad said. "I could feel how much you enjoyed the game."</p> <p>When we walked out to the driveway, it was getting dark. My mom pulled Dad's leg and he followed closely behind me, not realizing that we had driven all the way out to the driveway when we got there. When we got to the door, we stopped and my dad took one look at our car before saying loudly, "I'm done watching a story and going to bed!"</p> <p>My mom stopped him and said, "Are you sure you're ok with this, it's late," and then turned around and looked at me and said, "He has no business trying to stop me from having fun."</p> <p>When I looked at her, she smiled and said, "No he doesn't! You just look beautiful and I'm going to enjoy myself just as much!"</p> <p>We walked through the front door of our house as slowly as we could while my dad walked behind us, following me as if his life depended on it. As soon as we reached the ground, my dad asked mom to go to bed. Mom went into her bedroom as she heard dad ask Jenny to stay the night. Her mom said to go to sleep when she got to her bedroom. When we got our gear to bed, we laid down on our side of the bed and cuddled up closer to each other as our bodies warmed up the night away. We listened to the soft sounds of the night coming from my bed.</p> <p>I slowly started to fall asleep. My mind was slowly coming back to the real world and I was having trouble waking up. It was late and I had lost track of the time. I slowly woke up to the sound of my mother's voice telling me to make her an early breakfast if my dad wasn't around. I got out of bed and put my shorts on before joining her out by the kitchen. I could hear the coffee still brewing. Shortly there was no sign of my mom.</p> <p>I looked around to find her downstairs in the kitchen talking with Jenny.</p> <p>"Don't go out too late, we could get into trouble if they caught us," she said to her.</p> <p>I walked down the stairs from the front door to her and saw that mom's bedroom door was closed. I pulled my hand over it and she answered the door wearing an expression on her face that I was a little puzzled to see.</p> <p>"Don't forget to bring some coffee in here," she said as she moved to the bathroom, "it's better that way if you are a little late or you don't have to go to school today."</p> <p>"Yes, well I have some errands to run tomorrow and I wouldn't want to get caught if they caught us," I said as I walked into the living room and sat down on the sofa.</p> <p>"I'm sorry hon," mom said when she sat down next to me, "I couldn't help but notice that I didn't want to disturb your plans but you might want to sit here for a bit."</p> <p>I sat down on the cushions of the sofa. Mom stood up and said, "So I've decided I'll have to sit by you as all your plans areâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
