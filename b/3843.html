The Captain asked and smiled as he pulled his shirt back up over his shoulders.</p> <p>"She's one of those young girls. I'd give her a hand in the world if she asked," a voice whispered.</p> <p>"It's OK," Kaleb groaned. "Gerry can handle her." The captain grinned and grabbed his hand, leading them out into the corridor.</p> <p>"I just hope she doesn't hurt herself," Kaleb said, as he stepped back from his friend.</p> <p>"As long as she doesn't start anything, she won't hurt herself," the captain said. Then he gave Kaleb a soft smile and stepped back, looking down at him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," Kaleb said.</p> <p>"Don't even think about it," the captain responded, with laughter. "You'll catch it, I promise," he promised. Kaleb nodded and walked with the Captain back into the ship.</p> <p>When he had returned to the ship, his body tingling with a light sheen of sweat, the Captain made his way back to the ship. Kaleb's thoughts had been distracted as he had hurried to avoid eye contact with the Captain. He had a lot to learn about the young man before he reached his ship. He had felt uneasy enough to leave the ship after the Captain had called him a traitor, but after a while, he started to get restless on deck. He had walked back to the Captain's cabin and made his way to the door which swung open. With his eyes still closed, he stepped through the door.</p> <p>The Captain was sitting at his desk in the large room. His feet made a slight movement, as though a pair of feet were touching them and he heard some noise. When he didn't open his eyes, he frowned at the heavy oak desk. The wooden structure was covered with the same thick fabric that sat around it. He tried to remember the man's name, but something didn't seem right. He felt his blood surge to his head, then his heart. The Captain sat at the end of the desk, smiling nervously. He was still wearing the shirt that he had been wearing earlier, but it was gone. The captain's face was ashen.</p> <p>"Are you OK, Captain?" Kaleb said, trying to calm down.</p> <p>"You're staring at my desk," the Captain said. "I apologize!" He reached for the man's shirt, but it was too tight and when he pulled back, the shirt came off without much problem. The Captain had a full, healthy erection. It had swollen and it looked huge compared to his waist.</p> <p>"You're... so... handsome," Kaleb said. "I can't... it's just..."</p> <p>"I'm not ugly," the captain said softly. "I just need to take my shirt off." He lifted his shirt to allow Kaleb to help him. Even while he started to remove his shirt, the bulge in his pants could not be hidden. A deep sense of fear was forming in the Captain's eyes as he lifted the shirt off of his shoulders and let it drop to the floor. He was wearing a tight red, buttoned shirt that had a single button in the middle. He had a matching pair of low cut jeans with a large bulge in the middle that was much lower than his waist. His body was as lean and as muscular as Kaleb had imagined it would be. It was quite impressive.</p> <p>Kaleb could not believe that the Captain was even in the room. Then he remembered the conversation, wondering what was going on in the Captain's mind. A strange feeling started inside him and the Captain suddenly laughed.</p> <p>"What's so funny?" Kaleb asked.</p> <p>The Captain's mouth twisted in that way a woman would sometimes. He opened it for what was about to happen because he loved to be surprised when it happened. He stared into his Captain's eyes as he did that, then he closed them and opened his mouth wide, letting the tip of his tongue peek out. The Captain groaned and reached up to cup Kaleb's face. He pulled his head back quickly as Kaleb's tongue swam against it. The Captain moved his arm away so that it was not in contact with the bulge in his pants.</p> <p>"It's alright, Baby," the Captain said softly and leaned in to kiss Kaleb quickly. The Captain's arms tightened around his body as he leaned in on him. Kaleb's body quivered on his lap as the Captain's lips pressed against his. He tried to wrap his arms around the Captain and pull himself away, but the Captain only let him push against him. The Captain wrapped his arms around Kaleb's neck and then bent his head down and started to trail his lips against Kaleb's neck.</p> <p>"Oh my," Kaleb moâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
