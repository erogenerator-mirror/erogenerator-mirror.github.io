I asked her.</p> <p>She smiled weakly. "Of course I love you, and I love you still."</p> <p>She smiled even more, "but when I was a baby, it wasn't you. You were the first man to touch me. I knew how much I missed the feeling. It was so good." She moved closer to me and placed a soft kiss on my lips.</p> <p>"There," she smiled reaching out and resting her hand to the back of my neck. "That's it for now, and we will have lots of fun in the morning."</p> <p>With a nod of her head and a kiss to my cheek, we snuggled down to sleep.</p> <p>* *</p> <p>I woke up and to the sensation of my cock pressed back against my mom's warm ass. I got up and got my morning coffee and noticed there was still some of the dreaminess and a faint lingering taste from where she'd been lying. I put the coffee down and took off her silk robe and laid back to see if I could do it.</p> <p>"Oops." I muttered under my breath. "I shouldn't have done that."</p> <p>"Oh, really?" she smiled with a wink and sat up in bed. She stretched it over her tummy and put it on. "Well, I guess I had the time of my life. It seemed a bit strange last night. I was a little upset too then but now that, well..." She started to get down. "What are we going to do now?" "I don't know, but, it's your body next to mine and you're so close that I could just stay home tonight." She laughed at me.</p> <p>"Good point." I sat up and started to dress.</p> <p>"No," she said, running over and sitting on the edge of the bed. She pulled up her nightshirt over her head, revealing her bra, her perky breasts with the hardened nipples on the areola was visible behind the thin material. "I have a better idea." She turned her back to me and reached up to pull her nightshirt up. I followed her back over to bed and dropped them on the floor beside the bed. I set the table then turned to face her and pulled the sheet up covering us. "Besides," she continued, "I'm still going to have to get home tonight. We can do this later if you like."</p> <p>I nodded and we curled up together and fell asleep. This morning had been the straw to start a healing of one of its own. It also seemed like a good idea for me to start thinking about where this would lead.</p> <p>* *</p> <p>I was getting ready for work Monday morning at my office and I was just finishing up when my phone rang.</p> <p>"Is everything alright?" Mom asked.</p> <p>"I was just wondering if something could be wrong with something," I answered.</p> <p>"Yes and that's my daughter."</p> <p>"No," I replied getting a worried expression. "Please tell me you were just getting ready."</p> <p>"Yes." Mom said. "She texted me a minute ago saying she's heading home. She said she wants to talk to you tonight but she's not coming."</p> <p>"Ok," I was taken by surprise.</p> <p>"Yes she is," she said with a sigh. "She's been so kind to my daughter and is really upset that it wasn't at all what I wanted. I mean, she really is my daughter but, I... I was wrong, it's not going to be a happy ending."</p> <p>"Oh," I said with a sigh. But I knew she was right. I also knew that there was nothing I could do to change the situation.</p> <p>"Well, then, how about you join me on my flight tomorrow morning and tell me all about it?" She asked.</p> <p>"Fine with me."</p> <p>"Ok," she said. "I'll be by at six," she hung up the phone and stretched out.</p> <p>I spent the morning with Aunt Sally, who was my closest friend. I was going to give her a thorough review of what I'd learned over the last two days. On my way home, I stopped by the grocery store and picked up a few things from them as well. As I was about to leave, I heard Aunt Sally call from my cell phone.</p> <p>"Good morning," she said. "I was just taking a few things from the car and I saw your mother up here. Can I come over?"</p> <p>"Sure, she was just getting ready to go into town to pick up some groceries," I answered.
