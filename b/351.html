"Hey, what's your name!" It was my wife, Kathy, and she looked out over the city as I stood there looking a photo up.</p> <p>"Hi, honey. I am a journalist. I'm going to work on a couple proposals for new articles, but I wanted to do something for fun." She smiled and handed my photo to me.</p> <p>"My thanks!" I said as the rain finally broke.</p> <p>"So, what do you want me to do first?" It was a question I had asked her several times but never asked her. What she really did want was to do something.</p> <p>I took the photo and looked at it, wondering if she really had any idea of what she was getting into. I guess that is all that really matters to me. I could not imagine anything that even remotely interested me, but I just wanted to see her in it, so to speak. I took the photo back to her and took her picture, still looking out over the city.</p> <p>We exchanged the keys to an expensive car. The ride to her dorm was long and the weather outside was not conducive to a good soak-down of our two-week vacation. As we approached her dorm at 4 p.m. I had already arranged to have some food prepared for her on a Saturday morning, and then we would be able to do just that. My parents wanted to know if I would be joining them, and all I could say was something non-committal.</p> <p>Kathy seemed pleased with the way I was looking at her, and I was looking at her in an entirely new way, like I could see into her soul, and her heart. The whole time we were talking, a light went off in my head. I just stood there, thinking that she was doing this for me just to spite me, and if she ever even noticed we were not talking anymore, I would take the matter to my lawyer. This whole deal was going to have some negative repercussions.</p> <p>Kathy and I chatted the whole way to her dorm, and once at her dorm, we had a little more coffee than had happened. Kathy and I took the stairs back to our room, to get our towels. We stood there for a moment just staring at each other. Kathy had this goofy grin coming out on her face. I walked over to her and pulled her to me so we could kiss. It was a long lingering, wet and passionate kiss, and I could feel the tension in Kathy through my lips.</p> <p>I was wearing a pair of cut-offs just so, so that I could be comfortable while I was outside. We kissed, as we stood there on the front porch, looking at the horizon. The storm was going on and on, and it was going to keep getting worse and worst.</p> <p>"Is that what happened to you?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, sweetheart. I just... It was the way that they looked at you. Then I got caught doing it."</p> <p>I looked at her, and she looked at me, and I just nodded.</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it," she said. Now I could see just how lucky I was.</p> <p>We hugged again and kissed again. I moved out of the front open door and back to her bedroom. I took off my cut-offs and she grabbed mine and tossed them to me. I was glad to see that our clothing had already been washed, and I was ready to make another move on her.</p> <p>Her hair was down to the middle of her back and just as we were making out, I moved to her and took her into my arms, kissing her all over the way. My lips traveled down her neck, leaving a trail of love along her skin. I let my tongue slide up and down the hollow of her neck, causing her to shiver. I slid my hand down to her ass and I felt the muscles there under her jeans, which were hugging her in tight.</p> <p>My tongue slid into her ear and I just held her there for a minute, letting the sensations wash over us. I slid my hand inside her shirt and my fingers brushed her nipples. I didn't move my way from her ear; I just pulled her shirt slowly down exposing her breasts from the neck down. I took one nipple in my mouth, suck, licked and nipped it with my teeth lightly with my lips. She was just soaking wet, and it wasn't really due to the rain. I could only imagine what it would be like to feel her between my legs, and see her. I looked up into her eyes and saw that I couldn't resist a little moan, that I couldn't help.</p> <p>I pulled my head down to hers and put my tongue in her mouth.
