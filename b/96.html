I don't mean to brag, because I don't know everyone here, but I've met plenty of people who do it. My name's Matt. I guess I didn't feel right calling you by your first name, which I'm not sure I thought you were going to either. I don't consider myself to be a total prude, it's just that I'm usually very shy. Most of you look more like they do than I do."</p> <p>"You look more like you're out there, and that's a pretty good example," Mary said, "which is why you're probably all alone here, which is probably why I'm alone, right?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," she said.</p> <p>"I mean I'm sure you have no experience or any reason to come over any time after work," Tom said.</p> <p>"Just work?" Mary corrected him, "Work and maybe a lot of fun. In any event, I had some pretty good friends, so I had to make my own way around this house. For any other man, you'd think by now he'd be more popular with women. Well, I have no friends, and I don't have any idea what he's like inside. It just depends on where one goes from there."</p> <p>"So he's pretty well known, why is that so unusual? What's so unusual about it?"</p> <p>After some discussion, Mary decided she'd try again, "Well maybe if I told you the entire set up, I'd be a little more prepared for you. It's a bit more complicated than it might seem at first, though when it's not, you'll get the hang of it."</p> <p>Tom was still surprised by her openness and candor, and although he'd suspected there was a deeper truth behind her openness, he decided to try to make it all about her.</p> <p>"Okay, you know when I first met you, I had no idea what you were. In any event, I have no idea what I am or what I should do with your help. All I know is that if you ever decide you don't like something, or want to try something else, don't hesitate to ask me. I'm not that kind of person."</p> <p>"I'm not saying it's any kind of a good idea to be out for a while when we work with others like that. I don't think you could have the strength to keep all of that going if you'd met me," Mary said, "Actually, it's one of the things I want to ask you. I've never seen a man with any type of relationship and I've always thought it might be some kind of a joke or something. I'm still going to try to understand all of this and give you time to get back to some of your instincts. I'm still here at home, and I really do like coming here sometimes. Besides, it does give you an opportunity to take someone out here with you and hang out. It's pretty handy."</p> <p>Tom was very impressed by Mary's candor and openness, and thought he might have the solution.</p> <p>"You can call me Tom or Matt if you'd like. I'm not in any particular place that you might think you're qualified to call me," he said.</p> <p>Mary hesitated then, and Tom saw her nervousness. She was uncertain of how she would take being with a man.</p> <p>"All right, you're both right. I guess I'll just have to let you both know what you know. Right?"</p> <p>Tom and Mary both agreed.</p> <p>Later that morning, as Mary was preparing for her job interview, Tom got a call from Mary about an important contract. She told him that she wanted to change several things that were in the contract, including her company's annual review.</p> <p>"I'll make a couple of changes here and there to help you work with them," Tom said. "The last thing I want is any mistakes about your company's review. I don't want to do the same things on my employees, but the way the contracts are done, you and Tom can have copies of all your stuff. That might help a lot with any problems either of you have."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess," Mary said.</p> <p>Tom was happy that Mary was doing her job well, and he hoped that she would like to work with him more. As she left for her job interview, Tom was waiting with the door for his own.</p> <p>"Hey, don't forget to bring along your resume. This was all signed yesterday, and I was able to keep it in a neat, organized envelope along with your business cards."</p> <p>Mary came out of the office one afternoon and showed Tom the letter she'd signed for him.</p> <p>"Thank you Tom," she said, "Youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
