When she thought she could take no more he stopped; her legs were trembling and his voice and face were so familiar, she was shaking. He pulled back, looked into her eyes, and smiled.</p> <p>"You want this?"</p> <p>His hand pushed her panties aside and he felt her heat. "Yes, do it," she breathed, almost in anticipation of the pleasure it would bring. She felt his hand slide down her thighs and felt a shiver run along her leg. His fingers ran down her soft thighs to the tips of her fingers and he ran his finger tips up and down it. "And you still want this?" he asked, pressing his finger deeper into her warmth and feeling her shiver. His finger tip stroked and caressed, moving up and down and back down on her warmth. She felt the heat build in her, the throbbing between her thighs and knew it would be a good time and a good deal later today if it all went as he hoped. He pulled his hand away and looked down into her eyes again, she looked back up at him and smiled.</p> <p>"But I want to do this, so you will let me" she said, with hope in her voice too. "Because I want to be your slave, and I want the pain and pleasure I have never known you to experience." She smiled up at him. "You don't have to ask me. You don't have to explain anything. I want this. Do you want to do this?" She looked confused. "It sounds...I am not sure, maybe I want this?" she asked.</p> <p>"No," he said as his head began to move toward her. "But if you do this, I want to take it. And I want to take the pain away from you. Do what I want. Now." He leaned forward to kiss her gently, his hand caressing her shoulders as he did so. His lips pressed against her with a soft kiss and hers parted and his hand caressed her face. He continued kissing her and touching her with one hand as his hand slid down her stomach toward her sweet spot just above her sex. His hand moved up along her lips, rubbing her wetness as she pressed her hips against his hand to encourage his fingers. He pressed his fingers into her tight opening and slid one finger inside her as his other hand pressed against her swollen clit.</p> <p>At his touch the flush on her cheeks changed and she felt the first stirrings of excitement run through her body. The heat and moisture was so sweet and so erotic. He rubbed her, his fingers sliding and sliding into her depths and then back out. He loved her sweet wetness as he teased and pushed a second finger inside and then a third. She felt the surge of desire as he brought her to a climax that seemed to be more intense and more intense than before. It was a strange feeling, a different feeling at the same moment. He felt the heat build as she writhed and writhed against him until his fingers slipped from her body and his hand began to slide along her thighs to her clit. She felt his finger slide up her wetness to press against her nub. She cried out, feeling the heat as he stroked her.</p> <p>And then he was kissing her again.</p> <p>"Do not hold back this time." she said as their faces moved slowly to the music. His lips brushed hers softly as he spoke,</p> <p>"Let it happen, and I won't have anything to do."</p> <p>She smiled and pulled him close as their tongues danced. She ran her fingers through his hair as they kissed and caressed him. She felt the heat on them again, the hard length between their legs and wondered if she could fit all of him inside her. She kissed him and ran her fingers over his chest and back down to run fingers through his hair. She ran her fingers down his stomach and she felt the thick hardness. She ran her fingers down further, sliding the fabric of his shorts into his pants where she felt the heat of his hard length. He groaned and she could feel the tremble. A tear ran down her cheek as she held his hand so tightly she could hardly lift her arm as he stroked her. He pulled back a tiny bit, but she was determined not to let go and let this feel.</p> <p>She was on a roller coaster. She could hear the music, feel the passion and love in the air and feel the sweat on her thighs and the wetness. The music was a blur of movement as they danced together, each of them getting the other all worked up and ready. She was on her honeymoon, she might as well have been right at home having had her champagne and having had that one in her room. She could feel the fireâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
