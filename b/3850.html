She reached and pulled at my wrists, as she started to moan, and I felt her hand tighten. I lifted my arms, and she started to fuck me with everything she had.</p> <p>“Fucking kill me, fucking kill me…”</p> <p>“Yes…” I felt her nails dig into my skin, and her hips started to rise up from the bed again.</p> <p>“YEAH.” I gasped, and felt her pussy slam down so hard it seemed as if our pussies were hitting the inside of the other, as a powerful orgasm rocked through her. Her cunt walls squeezed me as she came, and I felt my own dick throbbing as it unloaded in her. She fell forward against me, and after a few seconds rest, rolled over, and laid down on me, our bodies still locked in the passionate embrace.</p> <p>“What were you thinking?” she asked, and I blushed at the question.</p> <p>“What ever else I was thinking?”</p> <p>“That was the greatest feeling ever… I haven’t had sex with anyone in a long time, I have just felt so connected to it for the entire day.”</p> <p>“You’re right,” I said, “I have never felt that much connection with anyone in a long time, and never felt that connection with you before.”</p> <p>I couldn’t believe what had happened. “We shouldn’t do this?” she said, and in an instant I felt my heart jump again.</p> <p>“We must not,” I said with a shaky voice.</p> <p>“Oh, don’t be silly, it’s okay. I want so much to hold you,” she said, and kissed me.</p> <p>I knew she wasn’t going to make it back to my room before I went, and I think I was more scared than anything else. I was still holding her hands, when she pushed me toward the door.</p> <p>“Shit!” I said, and I stood on my tiptoes as she pulled my shirt up and over my head, and then slid the pants down my legs and off. As her shorts hit the floor, she ran her fingers down the inside of my thighs, and slowly lifted them up. As I kicked my shoes off with them, I got the chance to sit on my ass and sit there, as she reached with her other hand and ran it all around my chest. I was so nervous, I think my heart almost stopped. I felt her hand lift the head of my erection and run her fingertip over it from left to right. I felt it get a little bigger and started to relax.</p> <p>“That feels so good,” I said, as I felt her start to slide her hand up it. She wrapped her hand around my dick and started to slowly stroke it up and down, while I watched as she squeezed her hand up and down, in between her thumb and finger making the tightness, which looked as if she was teasing me, but she couldn’t be too sure. Suddenly she pulled her hand completely off of it, and stood up from where she stood.</p> <p>We both said our goodbyes, and I turned around to watch as she walked towards the bedroom. For what seemed like an eternity nothing happened, and then the door opened and in walked my sister.</p> <p>“Honey,” she said, “is everything okay? This is all happening too fast, don’t you think?” she asked, concerned.</p> <p>“No, not at all.” was all I could say.</p> <p>Then I felt the warm, silky skin of my sister on my bare legs. I couldn’t believe it; I was actually laying with my sister’s naked body, in front of me, the only person in the world. I felt a little embarrassed as my dick started to get hard again and I had to fight the urge to touch her. Then I felt her hand caress my face, and she stood on my other leg, her hands on my shoulders pushing me away. As she continued to push me back, I felt her press into my neck, causing her tits to press into my upper chest. The feel of her warm chest felt nice as she lay in my arms.</p> <p>“You okay?” she asked again with an uncertain tone.“I mean, no—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
