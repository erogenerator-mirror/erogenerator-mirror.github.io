The more we do with the new relationship, the better?" "I guess." "How can she not?" "She's a whore." "I know what you're thinking." "I'm just thinking..." "It's okay," I said. We were done, but I still knew that I liked what I was thinking. "Besides, you've been a good girl, even if I haven't seen you." "But I can still make you happy." "How nice would that be?" "Do you understand that my only interest in you is what you want? I've made my point as well, and if you want that, you know you need it right now." "I want it too, and you know it. I'm sure as hell going without it." He leaned back and pulled down his boxer-briefs. He was hard as steel and I could tell that it wouldn't take much to make him hard. I reached out and slid two fingers into him. "I love you." "I love you too," I said. "Good," he said, "Because you better get me hard again. I haven't cum in fifteen minutes. I'm not going to last much longer." We kissed one last deep and lingering kiss at the same time. "Now come on," he said. He kissed me again, hard, his lips crushed mine. We parted, and I could feel him rising again. He took my hand and led me to his bedroom. "Come on. Up here," he said. He lay back on the bed. My body was on fire with anticipation. He was in between my legs and I wanted him to start right away. I reached my hand out and he used his fingers to spread my nether lips. He slid three fingers into me. "You are so wet," he said, "and you're so fucking beautiful. I can feel how excited you are." Then he took the head of his cock and thrust it up my channel, all the way until it was completely buried. I gasped at the feeling. He thrust several more times before he was fully inside me. He began his slow thrusting with each stroke, in and out, going a bit deeper each time. I wrapped my legs around his hips as far as he would allow me. He picked up his pace and began to pound me like a man possessed. I couldn't see or hear anything, but I was making sounds like a woman being fucked hard. He leaned all the way away and thrust his cock all the way back into me with each stroke. He knew it wouldn't take long. He was right on the edge. He had to be going at it now. I sensed that his strokes would give him an advantage in my body. If he did, he'd never stop. He was going to make me cum like he did with that girl. We were both coming at the same time. I was getting wetter, wetter, as his cock swelled and throbbed and I felt his release shoot deep inside me. We slowed our pace for a while, but then he stopped again. We kissed again, passionately, our legs tangled around each other again. "You're beautiful," he told me. I smiled and said, "I always was bad at telling people and I'm not that good at telling people." "Oh I can tell. I'll bet that your pussy is wet and ready again soon. I love it when you cum. Do you want more later?" "No. I'm so happy right now that I can't wait." He smiled. "I have a surprise for you. I think it's time that we got you a surprise." He went down and took my hand and led it to his cock. "Do you like having my big cock buried in your pussy?" I gasped at that, and he said, "It's like a big, hard, long cucumber. Have you ever had one up?" Oh yeah. "No, but I like for you to use me this way." I didn't know if I could take it, but I had to try. He turned me over and spread my legs apart again. "I think I want your ass," he said. I wondered, "What do we do?" "Just get on the floor," he said. I laid on the floor, my legs splayed and my sex exposed and ready. He slid in easily. We kissed again, as he began to pump. "I love being in control, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
