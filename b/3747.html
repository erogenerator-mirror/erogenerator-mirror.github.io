Suddenly, her body was on the edge of ecstasy. Her eyes screwed shut; her body twisted, contorted and twisted in rapturous pleasure; her hand was still pumping a fat phallus in and out of her vagina with all her might; there was no one else in the world with them. Her body stiffened and, as if on cue, tensed and then relaxed and then convulsed again and again.</p> <p>"God! Yes! Yes!" she moaned and gasped. "Yes! Yes! Yes! I'm cumming! I'm cumming!"</p> <p>He pushed his cock into her as far as it would go; and pulled it out. His hands went to her breasts and he groped them roughly. Then he got a hand on her back and pulled her to him. Her hips moved up and his arms got around her waist and he held her down as he plunged into her body again and again. She moaned and whimpered and writhed and screamed. Her hips thrust into him and he held her down and fucked her. Her chest heaved as she gasped for air. He held her down as he pounded her body. She was panting and he kissed the side of her neck. He kept fucking her; her breasts heaving, her hips and thighs jerking, and her body bucked under him. Her arms and legs sprawled; he kept pounding her and holding her down. She jerked up and down and twisted and flopped around. She groaned and her body spasmed. He kept fucking her while he kissed the side of her neck and face. As he kept fucking her, he kissed her, on the chin, on her mouth, on the lips. She groaned and pushed at his hair. He held onto her body, his body, her body as he pumped her. She was so wet he could keep his cock on the bottom all the way in and out of her. He kept going. 'It just happened. It's been so long."</p> <p>"It's been long?"</p> <p>His voice was hoarse.</p> <p>"Long," she said.</p> <p>"Then, we'll keep this an adventure," he said, and began pounding her again.</p> <p>"Then," she said, "if you want me, just tell me and we'll keep going. If you want me, just tell me and we'll keep going."</p> <p>"That's an option," he said and gave her backside a slap. She giggled. "I love to make you cum."</p> <p>"But," she said, "if this is it, I'll ask you. After all, who's going to refuse?"</p> <p>"Not you," he said.</p> <p>They got up and he led her back inside, took her inside, and they screwed one more time. He carried her into the bedroom and she looked at him through a misted-over look. He looked at her again and she watched him, watched him pound her, watched his face, and watched his cock, which was all rigid and swollen and she could tell by its appearance that it was about to do a full 180.</p> <p>"Oh my," she said, "I never noticed."</p> <p>"I don't want anything off the hook for you," he said. "No strings attached. This is a good thing for you. You're a very sexy young lady and I'm an old guy and all the young women I see naked and fucking don't have the same desire for me. And after years of being too shy, or shy about you being naked, I could do without seeing you naked." She grinned at him. "I like to undress!" she said.</p> <p>"Why don't you just undress and be at my disposal," he said.</p> <p>"Would you be naked as well and as horny as I am?" she asked. "Do you mind if I undress as well?"</p> <p>"Of course not," he said. "But, as a gentleman, why should I?"</p> <p>That was an immediate question. He'd been right. She was undressing but not undressing. She turned around and she was standing only a few feet from him while he stood at the doorway. He took another step forward and took her by her hand, put the other one behind her neck and pulled her onto him. "Undress," he said, as if she was a little girl who was about to be told to undress.</p> <p>She shrugged her shoulders and it was one of her very best ways to undress. As they stood next to each other on the bed she started unbuttoning her blouse. She stopped. "Can I take off my bra?" she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
