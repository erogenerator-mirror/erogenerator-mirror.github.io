He laughed, "Not that I have anything against you...but, you're sure not going to like it...because we don't swing that way. Besides, I didn't think it'd be that good. Do you? I'll just have to change that," he said as he reached over and grabbed my dick, giving it a squeeze. "See? How about, you like how this feels, right? Do you think you can handle anything in your pussy?"</p> <p>"I'm sure it'll feel great," I assured him, "and then I'll get over it."</p> <p>So saying, I kissed Mark goodbye and went home with my head hung high between my legs.</p> <p>-----------</p> <p>Three days later, I pulled into the driveway and noticed the clock was already at 7:00 pm. I quickly put on my suit and entered the house to find that Mark was already in the house with the door closed. We had a glass of wine as we got more and more comfortable in the house. Then I opened the second bottle of wine, and Mark lit both candles as we sat and took in what we had just shared in front of a full-length mirror.</p> <p>We sat drinking wine for hours just taking in the night's situation. It only got dark around 8:30 pm and we had another glass of wine each. I asked Mark what he had planned for our second meeting.</p> <p>"We're going to be watching the fireworks," he proudly told us. I hadn't planned to tell him about the first meeting and I didn't want him to get an idea when we get to the party tonight.</p> <p>After looking at the clock a few more times, I broke the ice and told him, "So, how long have we been going on this crazy weekend?" Mark laughed as he turned to me and kissed me.</p> <p>"Come on baby. You want to join us in a little fuck fest?" he asked with a devilish grin.</p> <p>"Sure." As we each took a drink of our champagne we each reached around the other and pulled the other toward us and put our hands around each other's hips. Mark leaned in, pushing his tongue into my mouth at the same time we ground our hips together.</p> <p>"You taste so good Mark," I breathed the words into his mouth, "I can't wait to have that nice dick buried in my pussy again."</p> <p>I sat back at my chair watching as Mark unzipped his fly and got down between my legs and took me into his mouth. As my heart rate increased again, I ran my hands through his thick, black hair as he sucked my clit into his mouth and slid one then two fingers in and out of me. Mark pulled me toward him, his lips pressed to mine as I felt his tongue lick each nipple.</p> <p>Then, my body stiffened at the touch of his lips as I felt a flood of wetness flood into my mouth. He took my hand and guided it to my breast, pushing his tongue into my mouth and tasting me. Mark sucked my nipple hard into his mouth and I felt my back arch. He pressed me back towards the chair, moving my hips toward him. This left me with the chair and was the only thing between us as I looked at his cock. He moved forward and as he held himself up, I reached out and grabbed it.</p> <p>My eyes went into heaven as I took him into my hand, stroking it along the long shaft until I had his entire dick in my fist. Mark took his hands from my breast and ran them down my chest, down the side that we had been leaning toward. Then he took my hand and slid it down to his balls and into the cleft of his ass.</p> <p>With one hand, he lifted my legs up, pulling them back over my head and exposing my pussy for the second time that night.</p> <p>"God, Mark...you are so fucking hot...you'll make me come so hard." I told him as I knelt down and grabbed his dick in my other hand. He started stroking me, pushing each of his fingers farther into my slit, moving them back out, back and forth over me, faster and faster.</p> <p>I pulled his cock down to the entrance of my pussy but as he pushed back, sliding it down the split at the bottom of my vagina, I slid it over my clit.</p> <p>"Oh yes Mark," I cried out, "fuck me Mark, make me come."</p> <p>Mark grabbed my hands, pulling us together as he thrust forward, burying his cock hard against my body. As our bodies collided, our sounds of intense pleasure filled the house.</p> <p>As our voices started to become soft, Mark pushed his body away and stood up.</p> <p>"Let's go upstairsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
