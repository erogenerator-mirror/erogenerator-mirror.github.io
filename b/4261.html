She stood and left.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" I asked.</p> <p>"We found a couple where we'd like to have my son stay with us for a few days. I told the husband to leave so we'd get him out of the way. I'm sure you'd be up to a lot of trouble if they took him here."</p> <p>"But we were only going to have a few hours together," I said.</p> <p>"If he isn't with us," she said, "maybe they'll take him home with them."</p> <p>"This wasn't our place!" I protested. "He's my kid. You can't force him into anything."</p> <p>"No, he knows enough to make it work, I have a feeling. I doubt he knows the people we were talking about anyway. I don't want to embarrass you by telling you but I'm sure it wouldn't take much to convince you he is my son."</p> <p>"I thought people got a bit of a kick out of that!" I replied with a huge smile.</p> <p>"The reason we are going to his house is because I got a surprise for you!" she said. "I got our own son here!"</p> <p>"We were at your house!" I said.</p> <p>"If he had got in here first, I guess we'd have seen that. When we left he had a few beers with us and I had a few things I wanted to show you and the husband. We sat and talked about him for a while. I think about once a month is better to let a wife know a little about her husband than a stranger, so when you ask, the wife knows and you don't embarrass or embarrass her. If he's not there with her, it's only for a short time. I'd be very happy if he was at a party and he got to see you. There are parties where they come to get drunk. You could even see a pretty young woman, one of my friends is a good dancer. Some of them have to pay the price."</p> <p>I don't remember telling her about the first dance I'd ever had in that place. I remember that it wasn't what I expected. It was different.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"He'll make it, he'll have to do it for us," she explained.</p> <p>"I'm in no hurry," I replied. "Do you want to stay with us or go elsewhere?"</p> <p>"I can't go somewhere else," said the woman.</p> <p>"We'll stop in and pick him up," I offered. "He has to do it on our property. We have a few things you might want. We can stop by the store or something."</p> <p>"I don't really like the idea of a stranger bringing you home," she mused. "I'd rather he had to do it with me than with my husband."</p> <p>I found myself being led up the stairs to get changed out of these clothes. I was in a little t-shirt and skirt, my own undies underneath. My wife turned from the door to the kitchen to look at me.</p> <p>"Do you want to come into the kitchen and find out which dish they had for the evening?" she asked.</p> <p>"No," I said. "I was going to do some shopping and would have just kept the food down."</p> <p>I finished dressing and left the house. I made my way over to our home office. I had to find out who the kids were, what they were up to, what they knew, and how they knew each other. I wasn't particularly concerned about my son coming home from a business trip as his parents had, but some part of me couldn't get away with this. Besides, my marriage was dead, so what if he'd be gone. I could keep working my way in life, maybe even just for a few months.</p> <p>I picked up my son on the weekend and we got to the house about eight. I had been working on my home office. I was looking at what he had. We sat on the patio as he started the computer and looked at the pictures. I couldn't help noticing his photo collection. He had several albums under his arm and some photos of other people. There had been quite a bunch on the albums but I wasn't sure what I would say to him or ask him.</p> <p>"That's one album, Dad," he said after a while.</p> <p>"That's some work I do," I replied. "I hope he likes the other ones."</p> <p>"He says it was probably the best part of the year," he said.</p> <p>"I think he likes the other stuff," I responded.</p> <p>"I did and I do," he said. "If he only knows you and your familyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
