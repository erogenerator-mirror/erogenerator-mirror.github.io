I've been fantasizing for so long about his cock I'll never have the nerve to do anything except accept it. The next day, we were off to the bedroom, naked and on our way to the shower, when he suddenly stopped and asked me to undress. So I said nothing, just slipped off my clothes and hopped in, never once taking my eyes off of him. At first he just stared at me, so I turned away, not seeing the big bulge that was forming in his lap, I don't think he expected it.</p> <p>I could tell as I rubbed against him, that the feeling was intense because the water didn't hit the right spot, and I could feel his cock begin to harden as much as it could, all I thought was my pussy was going to cum, I thought if I just sucked on it a bit, he'd be hard, so I pulled away a bit, then ran my wet fingers up his leg to his balls.</p> <p>"I have a little surprise for you." He said, I could be embarrassed now, but I'm sure he couldn't hold back any longer, as I slipped my hand around his cock, starting with him I slid my hand back, making a tight, wet circle around the head of his cock, my other hand sliding up and down his stomach, making my way up to his chest. I could see him staring at me with desire, and I knew what he wanted, and it just so happened, I couldn't wait any longer to feel its effect, so I began stroking him, feeling the power of it, thinking it would feel like it felt right now, but not. His breathing was rapid, and I could tell he wasn't sure if he liked what I was doing. I could tell from him that he wanted things to be different, though, he was in fact looking so hot that he couldn't wait to fuck me and show me he could control this huge cock.</p> <p>The thought of us changing it up again made me cum, and I wanted him to get up quickly so they could finish on the bed, I wanted him to fuck and play with me. I wanted his cock inside me, wanting my tongue on him, wanting his cock deep within me, wanting it to be as deep.</p> <p>The way I said it, he wanted I wanted. "Turn around, I don't want to be on my knees." I felt like if he kept saying that word I'd change my mind and I would have never allowed myself to do it. But he just wanted me to, "Roll over."</p> <p>"Turn around, turn around right now."</p> <p>"Let's see, do you want me to blow you now?"</p> <p>"Hell yeah, do it now!"</p> <p>So I lifted my leg, put it over his hip, and lowered myself slowly, slowly allowing his cock to penetrate my pussy in a way that felt so good it would take no more. He put his hands up, over hips, my feet in his lap, and slowly pushed my body down on his cock, letting it slide deep into me, and when we'd taken the plunge we both moaned out and kissed harder, feeling the pleasure of our bodies together.</p> <p>He slid my body on him, and I felt him begin to move us, so slow that the sound we heard could only be the sound of his cock sliding in and out of me, and I think it was our moans and the feel of it when it came out to the end of his cock. "Harder, fuck me, fuck me hard!" I needed it to, to feel it, to hear it, but never wanting it to stop. He didn't, the sound of it, the feel of it, the sound of it only added to the intense pleasure.</p> <p>He moved his body faster, but only barely, making me feel every inch of him, every vein that ran up and down his length, and I loved it when he would move his hips, pushing his cock deep inside me. I could feel the power of him and it drove me crazy, how could he be making me feel so good, I loved it, feeling myself get closer, closer to a powerful, intense release. I was thinking of the feeling of it when he looked down and made eye contact with me, I didn't have to say anything to let him know I liked how it felt; I simply nodded because it just felt so real, so true, all the same.</p> <p>I was so ready when he started doing some very erotic things with his hands, he was massaging my body, pinching my nipples, rolling them between his fingers, and I felt like his cock would burst, I was ready to throw myself over the edge, and just let it.</p> <p>"Babyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
