I'll be with you." I pulled him down to lay with me on our stomach. He curled up. I wrapped my legs around him. He rolled us over. I lay with him, snuggling up against him. I felt his hands slide over my lower back and lower cheek from behind. I could feel the hardness of his erection pushing against my butt. I reached behind me and wrapped an arm around his back, holding him tight to me.</p> <p>I began to move my hips in small little circles. Feeling his erection pressing into my butt and his hands rubbing up against my butt cheeks. I could feel the wetness that had formed between my cheeks on the shaft of his cock. I pulled back, giving him the opportunity to slide his cock back inside me. I didn't want him to fuck me right there on the bed, even though it would be impossible to do otherwise, and I didn't want to move around and get fucked by him. I would just lie, enjoying the feeling of his cock pumping in and out of my.</p> <p>"It's too much Honey." I was breathing hard when the phone rang.</p> <p>He rolled over so that I was on top of him again. He took my face in his hands and kissed me gently. I could feel his erection pressing against my thigh. He kissed his way down my neck. I didn't want him to leave. "I need you inside me." He leaned forward slowly and licked my left nipple, then the right. My skin tingled with excitement.</p> <p>His lips trailed down to my stomach and then he licked my stomach. He could taste the pre-cum on my thigh. It tasted wonderful, he mumbled, and finally stopped to kiss my lips. He looked up at me and kissed me softly, on the lips. Slowly, his lips traveled down to my chest and he kissed around each breast.</p> <p>At the other breast, he kissed the other breast, then took each nipple into his mouth and teased them, sucking as much as he could.</p> <p>He began to move up my body, kissing everywhere but my lips. He pushed my legs apart with one hand. He ran his fingers over my legs, running through the wetness that his mouth had left on me.</p> <p>He kissed my stomach as he moved up my body. He reached the head of my hard cock with his mouth, then ran it slowly up the length of my cock, licking, sucking, and kissing all along its length. He kept my cock in his mouth for a moment then slid his head down, sucking on my cockhead. The heat and wetness on this first pass around my cock was electric.</p> <p>He was on one knee between my legs, slowly stroking with one hand, and playing with my balls with the other. He looked up at me, his eyes pleading.</p> <p>He pulled me down in front of him, and I kissed him, hard, with full force. I could feel his hardness against my thigh. I wanted it inside me.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not wearing anything!" I said. He looked up at me and nodded his head. I pulled him up, lifted my legs and placed him on his back. I was kneeling above him, his legs on either side of his chest. I slid back on top of him and we kissed. His hands were running all back and forth over my body while his fingers slowly kneaded the smooth flesh of my stomach. We kissed passionately. It was the most wonderful kiss I had ever experienced. Our lips met, our tongues gently touched, and our bodies moved together, searching desperately for this final place to come together.</p> <p>As hard as he was between my legs, my hard cock was throbbing and throbbing. I needed to come! I grabbed his shoulders and pushed as hard as I could. His body jumped and twisted in the air. I had a moment to catch the breath and to come down from the peak. My stomach felt tight, my heart pounded and my breathing was erratic in the intensity of the moment.</p> <p>I looked down, and saw my cock buried between the soft lips of his mouth, as he sucked on me, as he gently squeezed my balls. The muscles of his throat and jaw tightened, as he licked and sucked the head. I felt myself build closer and closer to coming. As I was ready to come, he released me, turned himself, and lay flat on his back, pulling me with him. His lips met mine. Our tongues darted in and out in each other's mouths. His hand rubbed and caressed my stomach as his cock pressed up against my thigh, and I couldn't contain myself any longer.</p> <p>When I touched myself, I couldn't hold back. My juices flowed, wetting his body with its heat. I felt the warmth and his hardness as it pushedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
