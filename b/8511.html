"I don't care what you're doing. You just need to find a way to get away."</p> <p>"You're going to bed with Frank again tonight," Janice adds, almost as an afterthought.</p> <p>Janice is a pretty good-looking girl. I haven't met her before, but my friend, Kelly, is very pretty. Her legs are long, and her body is slim, but she has a nice set of breasts, probably 38DD or more, hanging nicely. On her face, she's not thin and she doesn't have a flabby body that's fat, but she has a nice, rounded tummy. Kelly has great big breasts; they stand up high and firm, without too much sag to their size.</p> <p>Janice knows that all men would love to get inside her. She's got a very tight body, and she's always put on the most provocative lingerie while she's been away. She's also quite pretty in a cute sort of way, although I always find her very attractive.</p> <p>"You wouldn't," I tell her. "I think that you'd like to, but you're not my type right now."</p> <p>Well, that's true. There's more to it than just being my friend. We have some very nice friends in the neighborhood, and Janice has told me a lot about her boyfriend, Roy. I could tell that she was excited when she told me, to no surprise, since he's pretty good in bed. There's more than one way to say it, and Roy is both. I don't think that Kelly is a virgin either.</p> <p>Janice has never once had sex. She has never said she wasn't sexually adventurous, either. It's true that I was a bit more adventurous than she was for sex that year in a high school girl's locker room. Janice has a few other friends in the neighborhood, too, if she so choose. I had a couple of good friends who were both cheerleaders that she hooked during college, but I'm sure that there is more to it, too. I've got a hard time not telling myself that I'm thinking the same things, when we're sitting around talking and drinking beer. Janice has told me a lot about Roy.</p> <p>So, as Janice tells me about Roy, there's something that I've wondered out there. As I look at this beautiful girl sitting next to me on the bed next to me, I feel my eyes starting to get really hard. Janice seems so innocent all of the time, even though it's not exactly true. She's certainly the most innocent person in the world, even if her sexual proclivities are not very adventurous. She's pretty plain looking, and she's a bit of a flirt, as any heterosexual would have to say. And, of course, I'm pretty good at seduction. But, the thing is that I like her just as much as I like fucking her.</p> <p>Before I'm a fool myself to think it, Janice is pretty damn good at seducing. As far as I can tell it, she never once talks down to Roy or tries to push him away. She's just a very good-looking woman, whether you believe it or not. She's a really good-looking gal, too, with a great body and great boobs, and she doesn't seem to mind talking down to him or trying to get him involved in a sexual situation.</p> <p>Now, I'll admit to knowing that Janice is definitely not my type, and neither is she. No wonder why she likes to flirt and get excited when she's out with someone. At any rate, sex with her is a lot of fun. You can say that she likes to be with men and women to begin with. It's all good for her. I'm pretty serious about all this. If you like sex with women, she loves it too. She's not all that bad. I haven't exactly been doing well in bed lately, but I'm sure that's not because I'm a lesbian. Well, I guess that's true. I'm not all that big on the lesbian thing, either, and I wouldn't tell her that.</p> <p>Janice gets a little, to me, weird about men. Most of them are the kind with whom she dates in the bedroom. She thinks that she's a nice guy, but some men don't turn her on much, and that's understandable. Some men can't do it and she's just a nice date, as usual. Well, that's too good to be true. Some guys can't do it and they're too damned strong for her to be a nice guy. And a lot of men are men. I swear.</p> <p>There's one problem with that.
