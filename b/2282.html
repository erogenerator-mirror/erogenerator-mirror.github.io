This doesn't end with me being late and being a late starter...or doing a good job, or going off the football field or whatever, no harm. It will just be us. And we know how to take care of each other," I added with a laugh.</p> <p>She laughed with me. "Well, we have to. I know what I want with you, and it's time for me to have a serious relationship with an older man."</p> <p>"That isn't what I want, I just want you to have this one last night. I want you to be my first and only lover, and, you know, a last kiss," I said as tears appeared. "I want us to go to sleep together every night. I'll make sure it's always the best, because we're going to be together, and I'd love to show you love again."</p> <p>I knew I could get her to be my girl, but the thought of her having sex with a man was not something I had imagined, and I wasn't looking for a commitment or a monogamous relationship or just the usual happy husband. In fact, I wasn't certain I wanted a relationship with her, but I knew it was a fantasy. And after being with that woman...I didn't know if I could ever want her again. If you had asked me earlier, I would have said that we had known each other for years and that now we were going steady. But I wondered a little about why.</p> <p>I said in kind of a voice, "Yeah, I guess it's kind of strange for me to do this with you, and you have to think I was some kind of guy who was kind of weird."</p> <p>We hugged and held each other as we laughed and talked. She was still naked and my erection was beginning to tingle again. I turned off the water, wrapped her in the towel and went back into the living room. I turned off the lights then and went down on the sofa. She crawled into the middle of the soft cushions and snuggled up with me, her head resting on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Are you sure it's okay with you that I went into the bathroom and got dressed and not brought any clothes back?" She asked.</p> <p>"Honestly? It feels like you're going to be the only real person for a while. I'm not sure I want this, I'll just come over at night on Monday and I'll try to convince you, I promise," I said, kissing her gently on the top of the hair over her ear.</p> <p>She smiled. "So...do you still have it?"</p> <p>"Yeah, just like you wanted it. Now come here for awhile and I'll give you a kiss," I said softly. "But I have to be home in an hour, so let's just get used to being together again and get back to what we were before."</p> <p>She looked at me curiously, but nodded as she put her hand on my thigh. I got up to the bedroom and shut the door. I returned to the living room, sat down across from her at the end of the sofa, and looked at her face. "You don't have to put it on your list of priorities," I said with a laugh. "You're too old for it tonight, too. We'll go back to being friends tomorrow and you can just leave and go to bed."</p> <p>"No, I need to think. I have a lot of work to do tomorrow. I need to think and plan and come up with all kinds of new ideas to make me a man again." She said as she looked at me. "How are you handling a little flirting?"</p> <p>"Oh, it's okay. Just talk and let me have my way with you. You go to sleep with your hands on your body, so I'll just do that with you...then, when I wake you up around 6:30, we can sort of do it all over again."</p> <p>"I'd love that," she replied, and turned her body toward me. My erection had not diminished a pang when I got into her bed and woke up with her on top of me. "I want to hear you say it again," she said with a grin.</p> <p>"Okay, okay," I whispered, trying hard to sound out of character. "Tell me what you were thinking while you were sleeping."</p> <p>"Well, we were talking and I think you saw everything that has happened between us. After we'd had a couple glasses of wine, she went and changed and brought me this. I was staring, but I couldn't get a lot of things out of my headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
