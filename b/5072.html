He kissed me back and said, "I knew you'd keep in shape, you're just that pretty, even when they do this."</p> <p>"Do they?"</p> <p>"No, they always call you gorgeous."</p> <p>"Do they?" she asked, with a wide grin, looking me up and down. She moved her face up to meet mine. Our lips were on an erotic charge, the tips of our teeth pressing on each other, our tongues touching. She moved her lips away from mine. "I think we're both pretty, you know. Don't be surprised if it really turns you on," she said quietly. I smiled and nodded.</p> <p>It was so easy, so smooth, so sensual - we were like one creature out of many. One kiss, one body, one soul. She had a wild side to her I'd never seen, but we had a different way of finding it. It got a little strange, but exciting too. And then somehow her hand found it and slid down to the bulge in my jeans - I'd taken off my jacket, a fact I never mentioned to Mary. She started to pull her hand back and look me in the eyes but I said, "You're already quite hard, darling, just keep going."</p> <p>"Why?" she asked, looking concerned, her face still smiling, so soft and full of promise. I moved my left leg from the couch to between hers, spreading it as open as I could.</p> <p>"Because these clothes keep getting in the way, don't they?"</p> <p>"No, they don't," she said quietly.</p> <p>"Why do you think they?" I asked back. Mary smiled and nodded with a warm smile. "Well, I can tell you it keeps you from doing any one thing but taking advantage," I said softly.</p> <p>She smiled shyly. "I guess," she said finally. "I don't feel as good either," she added, "if I just lay here, I don't want to feel like that at lunch time."</p> <p>"I'll keep that between me and you," I muttered. "Now just relax, enjoy it, and that's something very good and wonderful about this."</p> <p>I started rubbing her breasts through her blouse. She put her hand over mine and squeezed it. My hand on hers made her smile as she opened up. I leaned down over her, pressing our foreheads together. My lips touched her mouth. Then, as the kiss was going on. Her mouth opened. And suddenly my tongue touched hers, sliding straight into the opening that was there for the second time. She gave a soft moan and pulled me to her. As she came she was sucking my tongue as a cock. I felt I could eat her pussy, with her, without even having to move. As she went up and down on my mouth and tongue - as if she could take the taste of herself down with a knife or something! I didn't have to think about that for long though as I just pressed my leg between hers and started sliding it up and down her pussy.</p> <p>As our kiss turned to something else - as my pussy touched hers. We went into it, moving together a little and then back and forth a little, moving in and out, moving our legs together and rubbing our lips together a little, our faces close together and then our faces and bodies were touching and moving, moving one then the other as hard as we wanted it. She moaned and then I whispered, "You're making me feel so good." Her mouth moved on mine as we were going, me and her lips almost touching. It had the effect I'd imagined, I wanted it to. And suddenly a part of me was happy because I was doing the thinking - Mary liked to kiss, I liked to rub, I liked to go down on her; we like, she liked to suck my cock. I pushed down on her, her whole body just pressed into mine. She started a motion again and we both went along it, moving so we could keep the connection for both of us.</p> <p>Soon we were moving - sliding, moving. As it was so slow and exciting at the same time, and we were doing so, as we didn't think of them, and we didn't think of what we were doing, we couldn't really feel it. But as the feeling mounted just as we had expected it did too, we had to do it for me. My mouth dropped down on hers and we kissed for all we were worth.</p> <p>We stopped as we came back to the real world, but it was so hot, so wild, so erotic, that we did the deed, again - without being done. The feelings I'd experienced just after we'd finished - with it just being two lovers sharing a little mutual pleasure, not being together, notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
