Several others were present, as well; her nipples jutted proudly forward, but not as hard as before.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," she said more loudly. "That's incredible."</p> <p>Her gaze returned to the window while she lifted her skirt back down from her waist, the breeze brushing against the material against her legs, ass and lower back. She could hardly believe how good it felt sliding into her. Her clit tingled as she started moving her hips, her back arching and her entire body tingling, but she ignored the sensation of it.</p> <p>"How?" whispered the voice of the man on the other end of the conversation. His hips were now slowly rising and falling in a steady rhythm, like his shaft was sliding in and out of her slick pussy, the shaft gliding more quickly, gliding against her inner lips.</p> <p>"How fucking sexy you were!" the voice boomed. For a moment, the two were lost in a fantasy, not even knowing who it belonged to. Then the woman on the other end of the conversation became aware that her skirt had been hiked up to her crotch.</p> <p>"Wow, honey.." she said, "they were right. You are hot as hell!" Her voice rose in volume, a little more like that of a woman describing her pleasure.</p> <p>"Oh my god. You are getting a little loud," he said, "and you look like you're almost... coming?" She nodded her head, moving her hips to push the cock deeper into her. "How much?"</p> <p>She was moaning now, her words coming together like someone had done in a song, "how much?... how much?... oh my god."</p> <p>"Well," he said, not slowing his steady tempo, "I'm guessing I'm about to come."</p> <p>Her head moved in sync, nodding back along with the voice, "I'm almost there, but... I'm so close, I might..."</p> <p>She looked over at the man on the other end of the conversation as he nodded, clearly understanding her point, "Yeah." She put her hands on his chest and started pressing against his body, his cock now pistoning into her as her climax approached. "I'm almost there." Her hands dropped to his stomach.</p> <p>The man on the other end of the conversation groaned above her, "You can't wait any longer. You better fuck me as hard as you can." He started moving faster now, driving his shaft into her as deeply as he could, pushing upward against her swollen clit, then sliding out to meet his body on the opposite side of her.</p> <p>The pace increased, her legs slapping against the man's thighs as she met his every thrust, her breathing becoming ragged and irregular. "Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Uh uh, uh, like that."</p> <p>"How about right now?" he growled in her ear. "Fuck me! Oh... oh fuck..."</p> <p>He let go of her body, but left her with his cock still inside her, pressing against her G-spot even as he continued to grind. "I'm going to come!"</p> <p>"Oh... oh... oh god... oh shit..." Her moans grew as she started shaking, her eyes rolling back into her head, her legs and hips shaking as her orgasm approached again.</p> <p>The man's eyes flashed open and he was surprised to realize he was staring at her, his face blushed red but his smile was genuine. One hand covering his mouth, the other down between both of them, holding his rigid penis tightly, guiding the head against her g-spot, her body, trembling and trembling, her heart beating rapidly, her nipples hard as hell.</p> <p>His voice dropped to a whisper to the other woman, "I'm sorry."</p> <p>She looked at him over her shoulder, a little smile on her lips, "You can look at me when I come!"</p> <p>The man on the other end gave her shoulder a soft tug, pushing her gently down to her knees, then stood up straight. The woman on the other end took her position before he pulled her up to her feet, his shaft coming to rest between her legs, his hips pumping forward. "I'll just sit here, let you come." She leaned forward, the head of his cock nudging against her throat, and wrapped her arms around him, letting her nails lightly trail down his back.</p> <p>When she felt him withdraw, she closed her eyes and smiled at the sound of the voice on the other end. He leaned down quickly next to her in that position, one arm over her shoulders and one hand on her head holding her head in place. "C'mon, baby.
