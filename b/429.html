When I was finished, there was a lump in his throat. He took a breath and began to cough. "No. No. I can't." He choked and wheezed again. "I can't." He groaned. "I need time to recover. I've been feeling better. Please, you need to give me another chance."</p> <p>"Then give me something you've got. I don't know where it's coming from. I know I'm the same guy you're with, yet, I don't know how to deal with it." I pulled the top off my shirt, and showed him my breasts. They were small, but they were firm. I could feel a slight tremor in my chest as I caressed his flesh. He shivered as I cupped his hands in mine, bringing them to my nipples. He began to gently squeeze them as I sucked his nipples.</p> <p>"Ssssshh, do not touch me. It is too much for me. I couldn't do this." He started to protest again.</p> <p>But I knew better. The only time he allowed me to touch him was when I was trying to seduce him. He did everything I told him to do. I was a little afraid of what he'd do if I said he had to get that way, and he did. But I knew for the life of me it was best not to think about it. I was a little surprised by the way he was going but it didn't matter. He wasn't going to fight me when I'd found out that he'd slept with another man. It was all just too wonderful, and I knew all he had to do that night was get me back to the point he wanted me to be. I pulled my hands away, and he tried to keep them where I wouldn't touch them, but it was hard. "So you want me to get you back to the point you wanted to be?" he asked, "that's good. Good for all." He gave me a grin that could make a firecracker, and a good one wouldn't be half bad, but he didn't seem to be interested, and besides I knew it. I was too late. I leaned over and kissed him, and as my lips pressed into his my tongue pushed to join my lips. I felt his fingers tighten on my arms, and he tried to pull back but couldn't.</p> <p>"No, don't, I'm too tired. I can't. I'm all wet I can think of. You're too beautiful and I don't think I can. I can't do this. I want to do it for you." His eyes were shut tight and he looked as if he might disappear.</p> <p>"Please don't. I'm sorry. It's been so long too. You are the greatest thing to ever happen to me."</p> <p>My eyes were wide and I felt him slowly begin to relax. I reached down and gently guided his face to mine. "It's ok. It's just that," he stammered, and I put my finger on his lips slowly to urge him to say something else.</p> <p>"It is ok."</p> <p>I slid my hand back, and moved my mouth closer to his ear. "You did what you needed," I whispered in his ear. "I've had a chance to be a slut and you gave me an opportunity. You had to have known it wasn't going to happen. Your cock was the only thing I had." I pressed my hand against his erection, and he jumped. I could feel him soften and fall away from me. "And you made me feel like a woman. You gave me the opportunity to be the sexiest girl I know. You made me feel like a girl and I didn't even want someone else to take things from me." I kissed his ear. "You made me feel good."</p> <p>I let my hand on his hard body slide down to his waist, and slipped my hand inside the waist of his shorts, to find him rigid and warm. His head lay on his hands and his breathing was labored.</p> <p>"My turn again," I whispered as I undid the knots in my shorts. His eyes were half-closed but he seemed to lift himself off the bed more now. I stood up, and took his hands in mine turning him on his side. "Come here," I said.</p> <p>He looked at me for a moment and then he was gone.</p> <p>The first thought that came to my mind was, "What had I done? What am I going to do with all this?" I looked at my reflection in the mirror, as tears came to my eyes and my heart began to pound.</p> <p>A week later, the two of us were sitting on the couch in the living room ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
