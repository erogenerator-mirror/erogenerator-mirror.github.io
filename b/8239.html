It was so wet, and I looked up at her and she looked down at me, licking her lips. I lifted myself up until I was sitting on the barstool beside her, then leaned down and took her left nipple in my mouth. I sucked, then sucked and she started shaking, a series of spasms.</p> <p>"Don't swallow," a voice inside me whispered. "You don't have to breathe. Just breathe as if you were sucking on a pacifier, then let it out of your mouth. Do it gently, no more than a half minute to an hour. Breathe deep, and stop shaking."</p> <p>I did as my Master told me, then resumed sucking on her nipple. There wasn't anything I could do to stop it, it just went on and on in her head. And each time she tried to stop it, I kept right on sucking, sucking hard as she was shaking and I could feel the waves start to hit her. It didn't seem to matter that she was shaking uncontrollably and she was trying to stop it, so I kept on sucking, and as the sensations built until my head was spinning, she broke free and let out a loud moan. I looked up at her and noticed she was crying.</p> <p>"Shhh," I whispered, rubbing her shoulders softly. "It's okay," and I kissed her cheek gently. "I've never felt that way before. Please, don't do that."</p> <p>I held her, my face close to hers and we kissed a long time, and it was wonderful. I broke free to see she had calmed down some and was smiling.</p> <p>"Thank you," she whispered, as she took a step towards me. "Thank you so much," was all she said.</p> <p>I didn't know what to say, so we sat there in silence for a long while, the only sound that was heard was her crying and her crying as I caressed her gently and she finally got close to me. The feel of her soft body against mine had me so excited that I could hardly stand it. I slipped off the bar and went to the washbasin and washed her bra and panties, then held her so that she could wash mine, and then she started washing my own. We had a nice shower together that night, washed ourselves, then we fell asleep holding each other naked in each other's arms.</p> <p>I woke first, feeling the heat from the sun on my face and the softness of her body pressed against mine, her arms were around me and her legs were touching mine. I don't know if it happened because of the heat or if I just realized that we had made love last night, because the sensations I had been experiencing were just so intense that I had to remind myself that the only reason we didn't do that was because we didn't want to be. I had the most wonderful feeling in my heart about her, but this time it didn't seem right. I was confused, because if she really loved me that much she wouldn't stop me.</p> <p>And what made one of us so special was that for some unknown reason, because of my doubts that she was in love with me, that she loved me all the same, I got a hard on. We slept like that for hours until I felt her arms tighten around me and she was silent, her breathing quick. I kissed her forehead, she rubbed my thigh and I felt her moving her body against me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, "just let me hold you tonight, okay? It's just that I don't think I could control myself. You're so beautiful. Please don't be upset."</p> <p>"No," she assured me. "You're lovely, and I don't want to be hurt, no matter what happens."</p> <p>She fell asleep in my arms, and before I knew it she had her head on my shoulder with her arm around me. I held her for a long time until sleep overtook me, then we lay quietly for a while, until we had both had another run down sleep, then we took turns getting up to shower, and then dressing and leaving, I told her I would be home when she was ready.</p> <p>I felt better when she got into her car on Thursday night, and I didn't think I would be disappointed in our trip. The first time I saw her it was my turn to be her date, and even though she didn't love me, she made me feel special and felt wanted, and I liked it. We both loved the attention she got from men and women, but she always felt it would be easy to give up control. It wasn't something we talked aboutâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
