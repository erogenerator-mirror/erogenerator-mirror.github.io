I hope you will forgive me. I have to get back to the kitchen in a hurry. If you need anything, just call."</p> <p>"I do," she replied, taking a step toward him. "My office."</p> <p>"Your office, too," he said, grabbing her hand and pulling her closer to him, giving her a hard kiss on the cheek, a kiss only brothers and sisters share, a kiss only one sister can give. She felt like she was melting inside and could hardly breathe. His lips were soft, and his tongue probed her mouth gently as he pulled her tightly. Their heads almost touched, and she felt his erection against her stomach. She closed her eyes again, lost in the moment. She didn't notice she was trembling, either. This just felt so right. She leaned her lips to his and allowed herself to feel the softness on her tongue. His lips were gentle and sweet. She let her breath catch, his lips brushing against hers. They kissed for an endless minute.</p> <p>When the moment of truth returned, she broke the kiss. "I am nervous. What if someone sees?"</p> <p>"It's alright, it's just that you are so sweet. I just hope I got to make you feel as special as I do," he said, reaching down to pull her closer.</p> <p>"That's my favorite kind of thing to talk about. So, I guess I should thank you." "For what?"</p> <p>"For trying to be here with you when I was only ten."</p> <p>"I'm glad. I've been so scared."</p> <p>He gave her an encouraging smile. "I know. I guess you're not scared of me, either," he said with a sigh, as he reached for the hem of her dress. "I'll leave your panties off," he assured, as he grabbed them, pulling them off and tossing them on the chair beside the bed. His arms wrapped around her waist, crushing their bodies together.</p> <p>"Oomph," she uttered, feeling his hard erection against her abdomen. "I feel so strange," she said, her eyes closing as his kisses trailed across her forehead.</p> <p>"Come on," he said when they broke apart, "we have time."</p> <p>He helped her up, putting her on her feet and gently guiding her toward the door. "Let's go upstairs," he suggested.</p> <p>She was still trembling as they walked upstairs. "I'm so scared," she said. "I'm not sure if..."</p> <p>"I understand," he assured her. "There is no need for me to worry. I don't care who you are, I'm going to enjoy this." He took her around the suite and unlocked the sliding door. Inside was just as they had left it, but it was different. His room was dark, and they could not make out the details. The walls were pale white, with tiny slivers showing in the background: some kind of glass, some type of soft blue, others like that just white. There was a large mirror above the door, but, apart from the glass, most of the light came from what seemed like a large circular window that overlooked the city. She walked around the room and looked at herself in the mirror. "I'm not sure who is going to show up, but we can't go out there without clothes on," she said.</p> <p>"We wouldn't want anything to show," he said, running his hand over her left breast. "Unless we've got a plan."</p> <p>"What kind of plan?" she asked, reaching for his cock.</p> <p>"What do you think? Should you be doing this?"</p> <p>"No! No."</p> <p>"Then let's take it slowly."</p> <p>Her hands wandered over his body, taking him in for the last time. It had been only a day since they had last seen each other when they had gone to bed at night. It was a wonderful start to their relationship, which had been wonderful since the end of their first date. He had wanted to, she had wanted, but could not. "My god," she whispered as his hands slid down her back. One of the first things he had done was place his finger on her anus. The sensation was electric.</p> <p>"What is it?" she asked, pulling away from him.</p> <p>"Come on, let's go!" he said, pulling her forward. She had had her doubts once before, but not again now, not with him here. "It's just something I do." His hands moved down from her shoulders to her breasts, cupping them, feeling them. "I've wanted to do this for years, haven't you," he said. "You're beautiful."</p> <p>"Well," she began, taking in more of him than she thought she should.
