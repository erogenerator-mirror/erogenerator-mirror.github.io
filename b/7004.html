"Thank you, sir."</p> <p>*</p> <p>"So it will be as though we have a regular wedding!" she said with a smile as soon as she saw the two new cars entering their garage.</p> <p>She opened the door as quickly as she could. "The wedding to Ben."</p> <p>"Yes, and to Ben."</p> <p>They embraced at the door once the couple walked in. "Gentlemen, if you'll all please turn off the lights and open a bottle of Chivas, your ceremony is almost up."</p> <p>Sensing they were still too wound up to do anything else, they agreed.</p> <p>After taking a quick look in the back of the store room, the couple saw a note sitting in the middle of the counter. It read:</p> <p>"We're not allowed to say no to the bride-to-be! We just love to spend time with you both. My friends, meet Katie."</p> <p>The note made Ben's pulse stop.</p> <p>"Who's in the truck?"</p> <p>"I'm afraid it's just Katie from work. We could have something good with her if you were out there! Or better yet, we would take care of everything you need to take care of. Now, just have a good weekend!"</p> <p>Ben got out. "And thank you."</p> <p>The couple drove to her house, feeling the rain on their skin.</p> <p>"It was absolutely fantastic. I'm glad we're doing this! I've missed it so much."</p> <p>"Yeah, me too."</p> <p>Katy had been out shopping all afternoon. She'd had a tough life. Working at home had made her feel empty and abandoned. Her family had made her feel that way.</p> <p>Sitting on her little red convertible, she looked out at the parking lot. All kinds of people were coming out of the buildings of her business. It was pretty late. She felt like she could really tell where she was going now. She saw a few friends in their cars talking about a new restaurant they were working at, but she had already left her car.</p> <p>Katy saw the other cars parked nearby and waved.</p> <p>"Hey, guys!" she called out.</p> <p>They turned the red dome light off and walked inside. A few people greeted her. They came over and introduced themselves as Jack and Mary. The group hugged her tightly and Mary whispered in her ear.</p> <p>Katy heard her voice for a moment and smiled. The last few days at work had been so crazy! It was like she was living out of some nightmare. No one knew that she was out there!</p> <p>The two walked back to the house and got out.</p> <p>"Thanks, guys! I mean it! You're absolutely right!"</p> <p>"We're glad you came. What's really good?" Jack said.</p> <p>Katy smiled.</p> <p>"This wedding is fantastic! You wouldn't believe it."</p> <p>Mary laughed as Jack and Mary hugged and kissed. Katie watched them as they kissed and laughed.</p> <p>Katy turned her head forward and saw Mary. She smiled.</p> <p>Mary gave her hand a little squeeze and went over to get Katie some wine.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm going to do some shopping, but we'll just order room service."</p> <p>"Can you two wait a minute while we're getting ready? This is your wedding, so it won't be a big surprise!"</p> <p>She had them do some shopping when they came back.</p> <p>"It will," she said, smiling at Katie. "Come on. I want to see all of the new stuff you get, just in case it's not quite as big stuff to worry about. This might get easier."</p> <p>Mary sat on a couch and waited for them.</p> <p>"Honey, can you wear a teddie, or something?" she asked as they were walking out the door.</p> <p>"Oh, that might be a good idea, but let's wait for a minute. I'd hate to get knocked up on the way to the party."</p> <p>"Okay," Mary said.</p> <p>Katy started to leave and stopped when she saw Ben. She knew then, they wouldn't get any more married. At least she hoped.</p> <p>She smiled at him and turned her head around, smiling to herself. She felt herself get wetness between her thighs every time he looked at her.</p> <p>Ben was in the house when they got back, but he was already out again. He walked into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Come on," he said. "Let's go get comfortable!"</p> <p>As soon as he said that, Katie knewâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
