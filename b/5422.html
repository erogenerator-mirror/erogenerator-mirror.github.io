"There is something I want to tell you."</p> <p>"I love to hear you get up and cry."</p> <p>"That's the most I've ever heard."</p> <p>I pulled her in to me. "I think I'm in love with you," I said looking up at her.</p> <p>"That's a really good sign."</p> <p>We got dressed and went to the cafeteria, where we had a few meals. We then went back to her apartment, where we had a shower and got into the bed together. There are two cameras hidden in the walls and I was starting to develop a routine of using them against her.</p> <p>"What are you doing?"</p> <p>"Just thinking the whole time."</p> <p>"I want this as much as you do."</p> <p>I put my cock inside of her.</p> <p>"That feels good."</p> <p>We fell asleep on her bed, spooned together. Before we slept again, we kissed each other. I loved that moment.</p> <p>I opened the door to her room and there were cameras in the windows and behind her.</p> <p>"Let me make a suggestion. I need my husband to do the same."</p> <p>"Of course." I kissed her awake. "But if you want that to happen, then come with me. There is some stuff I need to put on tape for the camera crew to video."</p> <p>"That sounds really good," she said.</p> <p>We got out of bed and I walked down to her. "How are you doing tonight?"</p> <p>"I'm ok."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>We kissed.</p> <p>"I'm not sure about the rest of us."</p> <p>"I have a feeling that something's going to be coming. You're just the beginning. I want to share my story with you."</p> <p>"I love that about you."</p> <p>"We have all night."</p> <p>"That's my point."</p> <p>I kissed her.</p> <p>"We'll talk later."</p> <p>I pulled on a robe.</p> <p>She took a glass of water and said, "I'm going to do a little bit of cleaning."</p> <p>"Go in the living room."</p> <p>I grabbed a towel and dried off a little before I left her room. I walked down the hall to the living room where the cameras were set up. I closed and locked the door.</p> <p>"So you want me to have sex with him."</p> <p>"I don't know what to say. I know he's good and everything."</p> <p>I walked up and sat on the sofa.</p> <p>"Now be honest. You have been acting like a slut since you got on this plane."</p> <p>She stood in front of me.</p> <p>"Can I?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She unbuttoned her blouse and peeled it off, leaving her in a sheer red bra underneath. Her nipples were hard and pointed. Her breast heaved in the air. I pulled her towards me. She held onto me tightly. She kissed my chin and neck, and her eyes burned into me. I pulled her down so we were on the couch. I pulled down the zipper on her skirt, which was still just under the waistband, and it slipped down. Her pussy was smooth and pink. I pulled her panties down and the wetness of her arousal was clearly evident. I pushed my tongue into her mouth. "You have such a soft mouth." I pulled her hands down to cup her breasts. "I love sucking your nipples."</p> <p>I lifted her up and turned her around. I turned her onto her stomach, pulled up her skirt and her panties off.</p> <p>"There's only one thing that can please me," I said.</p> <p>I turned on the camera. I moved her to the middle of the room so we were facing each other. I sat up with her on the sofa.</p> <p>"I can see you like this," I said.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She kissed me.</p> <p>"You like to kiss," she whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>We kissed slowly and tenderly. I massaged her breasts. She rolled her nipples between her thumb and fingers as if she was trying to make them erectâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
