I had never been that sexually adventurous before, but with the way he had been acting, I thought it might be a good idea. We got home around 2 in the afternoon. I had a good time. We continued to talk about things a lot about our lives while we ate. We laughed a lot. He was such a nice guy. He was so nice.</p> <p>He asked my advice to make sure that he would be in any college. He wasn't going out on Saturday's, but on Saturday's he would be going to a high school. That would be two more weeks, and he would be out all weekend with only the promise of some fun. I told him I would be sure to talk to him, and for him to think about it.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was an interesting week. We had lunch at the house, and watched some good movies. We had no problems getting up early. The night was exciting. I think he thought we might go for breakfast, though it hadn't been that he didn't go for pancakes the first time. He had been doing that a lot so it was almost like he was really hungry. We had sex in the hot tub. We kissed and fell asleep in the tub. We did some other sexy things before we went to bed. We slept pretty well. I don't ever think he was tired. I am just glad I was able to make up for last night by giving him more sex. What a strange combination of things.</p> <p>When I got home that night, I was very horny. I had masturbated that afternoon with the thought that I would be going out on Saturday. I was thinking about him that afternoon and was still horny. My sex was pretty tight and it was a long time since I felt that need. I was almost ready to go to bed when I got a call from him. I asked him to come over. I had invited him to join me at the pool Saturday, so I could have him join me there. I did ask if he would be willing to be my date in the afternoon. He agreed, which made it even more exciting.</p> <p>He arrived at my house Saturday morning about noon. He looked stunning. He wore khaki shorts and a sleeveless shirt, and I could easily tell he must have worn those shorts all through gym, because he looked even sexier in them than usual. We had a lot of catching up to do, and I said that he might not want to go to lunch with me. He said no. We went out in all manners. He had a bag packed and was ready to take off when I told him that we weren't going to go out. When I said "No", he said that it sounded like we could go to a strip joint. He got that idea.</p> <p>The first thing I heard when I walked in the front door was that the guy at the door was a regular, or maybe a regular, for that matter. I wondered if maybe I did make a mistake. I guess there were always a couple if a couple, and he might have been a regular for some reason. That idea might also be the reason, but I wasn't really sure.</p> <p>I put on my one piece swimsuit while he got into a swim suit. I had to hold it so it didn't slide off. He saw that the bottom part of the suit was showing some, and I thought he could see more than enough. The top part was kind of a tight fit, about four inches long, and two inches wide. I wanted to just cover up, and didn't. We went to the bar. I had to buy his drink for him just before lunch, and he ordered one for me.</p> <p>I watched him, and was getting nervous as we went. It was strange, but he was not a bad looking guy. I felt that I had to have him, but at the same time I knew that I was in trouble. I kept thinking of some of the things you might want to do to me and make me feel good about myself when I got home. Was I getting turned on by this, or was it just a coincidence that we had gone to the pool and saw him there, and he had liked what he saw?</p> <p>As he sat down at the bar I looked at him, and he blushed and said very softly, "I think I'm not going to waste any of my time." Not one word was said as we finished our drinks. He turned to me, pulled off another two full shot Jack Daniels, and then asked if I was ready for a hot tub. I told him I wasn't. He was just looking around for the right spot. He turned down the beach, walked over to me, and stood behind me, but I felt his cock on my shoulder.
