I looked at her for a moment, and then grabbed a paper cup from the shelf behind the stove and took a swig of my drink. "How is that? You seem pretty drunk."</p> <p>Her eyes met mine, and were a bright shade of violet in a beautiful green almost like that of green, and they were like two sapphires on my skin. "Well, this is pretty good. I've never felt this way about anything. This is very interesting."</p> <p>"Yeah, the food is really good, and I have to admit you have a great tan." I looked up again. Her eyes were closed, her chin was against her head, and her legs were spread, and her feet were up on the counter, with an open palm resting on the edge. She was leaning forward, her hands resting on the counter as she looked up at me.</p> <p>"Now, I've never really met any guys with clothes like this before." Her voice started out quiet, like she was trying to take something she didn't really want to. "It's kind of a turn-on, that kind of turned-on, and now that we're married, I'm not sure I can let it go. And, I just might try and stop it. I can live with that..."</p> <p>I started for a moment. "And what? I'm not sure I'm ready for a threesome. And I'm not sure I want a threesome."</p> <p>"Oh." she opened her eyes and grinned, reaching for her drink again. Her head came back down and her mouth was open, and the corners of her mouth were looking at me again, as if she was trying to read my expression. "Yeah. Well, you're right. I don't have the heart to ruin this for you."</p> <p>I took another sip and set the glass down, and stared at her body. She was sitting at the end of the counter, with her legs spread, and looking up at me as if she didn't see me looking at her, as if I was the only thing around. Her eyes seemed to get darker as they wandered over and over again. I just wanted to look at her for a moment, like I was looking at a painting, and had no idea it was her at all.</p> <p>I could feel her fingers running up and down my legs as she ran the top part of her hand over my thigh, and I tried to keep my composure. I'm sure in this moment, in my head, I wasn't supposed to be looking at her, but her body was all I had ever really wanted to see. And if I tried my hardest to stay calm, I knew it would backfire on me, and I really couldn't take it, and my mouth was ajar.</p> <p>She sat back suddenly and looked at me. She leaned forward and put her hands on her chest, and then stood up. She reached down again, and with her fingers on my lips, she wiped my lipstick off, and then looked me in the eyes. For the first time I could feel fear and apprehension, but I also saw a real longing and desire there, too, as if there were not just one person, there were two.</p> <p>"So," she said and took another long, slow sip of her drink, and said it over and over again. "You want to make out."</p> <p>I thought I might say yes, but it just slid out and I just said, "OK." I didn't.</p> <p>Her face went away from my eyes the sudden chill that came over me. I looked away, and looked up at her, and it was as if my head was still somewhere inside an old movie. I was looking back at her now, and her eyes were still glistening. She looked like a ghost in the kitchen, and at the same time made no effort to close her legs as she stood. I knew if I hadn't been looking that I must have been staring at her, and I tried to be brave.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" She asked in a soft voice that was like music in my ears.</p> <p>I couldn't think of anything to say. I just didn't know what to say.</p> <p>She was looking into my eyes. There was just something in her eyes that was so dark that I almost couldn't make out a single tear. Then I looked up at her again, and she was watching me. But the expression on her face was very soft.</p> <p>"Have you ever done this before?"</p> <p>"No," I whispered.</p> <p>I looked over at her and took another sip of my drink. I was afraid, at some level, that she might tell me not to go that far. I saw my own eyes start to water slightly, and tried to make some kind of decisionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
