I asked.</p> <p>"I lose, I come first. And after that I won't get anything but my clothes." She said softly and laughed, a bit embarrassed. Then she reached down and grabbed my cock, feeling it throbbing in her hand, and started moving it up to and down, almost absentmindedly. I felt like a school teacher as she teased my dick with her stroking fingers, my moans growing more and more audible.</p> <p>"Deal or play, or I'll do something else that will kill you," she threatened, grinning when my eyes met hers. I wasn't sure where she'd got my meaning, other than I didn't want the bet. "Or I'll do something that will just really hurt you," she continued. She let go and grabbed my cock with both hands. "No fair, I've been trying to decide now why we've gotten to this point."</p> <p>She stroked it softly before taking it in her hands. It seemed like there was some kind of spark of energy building within her, it might be her nerves and all, but the feeling of power inside the older woman was simply incredible. She had an incredible grip on my throbbing cock, using both hands to pump up and down, and every few strokes she would increase that pressure until my cock was actually being tortured. It felt so good and so wrong at the same time, but I couldn't deny it. "I have a better idea, maybe I'll just lose," I decided.</p> <p>I started looking around to make sure we were alone. "Ok, but don't do anything that you don't want to," she cautioned, looking me in the eyes. I didn't have anything to say, and when we moved to the couch she put the coffee table aside in front of my position and moved the coffee table closer. Then she grabbed me, holding her hips in position and leaned her upper body as far back as she could with me in her grip on me. Her face was close to mine, and after a few deep breaths she leaned down till our lips almost touched, and she gave me a quick peck on the lips. I knew she couldn't be upset by that. We kissed some more, her hands working their way to my chest area. After a moment she lifted of me and took a step back. "Let me know if I make you cum."</p> <p>Her look was so sincere. "Deal!" She said, a little flustered. "I'm sure that will help us both."</p> <p>I looked at her for a moment, realizing that we hadn't really said it out loud. She was aching for it. "I need to cum too, I need to finish this. Besides, I've already made it with you earlier in the week."</p> <p>With that she threw her arms around my neck and kissed me passionately. My arms wrapped around her bottom and pulled her body closer to mine. I could feel her firm breasts pressing back against my chest, and I felt her wetness coating my shorts when she broke the kiss. "Now let me show you how much I need it," she said. Then she stepped back a bit and removed the top of her bikini top, her hard nipples sticking out from beneath each lace of it. She held the pose for a moment, then threw her arms high above her head, letting her nipples pop out of the bikini. She looked into my eyes, and she shook her hair back slightly.</p> <p>"I'm ready, now it's my turn," she said, taking the bikini top and tossing it into my lap. She stood there for a moment, her chest rising and falling as she turned. I had never seen her boobs in such a revealing manner before, a woman's body coming out from one layer of fabric to another. "Just like before, just so fun," she said as she moved her arms and threw the bikini together. She then put a foot on the couch behind where we were and bent at the waist, her hands grasping the front of both to her chest. Then she used one hand to caress her breasts, as the other hand rested on her stomach. I watched as she pushed her breasts together and moved her hands to slide it down over the top of her tummy and over her clit, which had emerged from its protective shell and was standing proud up at the junction between her thighs. She ran a finger along the front side of her clit, watching me as she moved closer.</p> <p>"Do that again, but do it in slow," she said, looking at me. My hands went down onto her stomach and slid my hands under her bikini bottoms, feeling the soft fabric of each mound. She held my hands steady in her hands and raised one leg to let my fingers slide through the waistband of each of them, moving them down each one until my fingers rested on her stomach. Then her lips parted and she let outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
