Soon he increased his pace very rapidly as he was sure that he could cum before the night was over. As he looked down at where his throbbing cock was gliding in and out with all the power in it, he could see the pre-cum oozing from his cockhead as it bobbed and rolled around in anticipation. Peter kept pounding his cock into her pussy, his balls banging against her ass cheeks as he began to lose control in this madman.</p> <p>Suddenly, he felt like he had an arm, and he knew that his cum was about to erupt. He had watched his wife on a few occasions, but never had this happened to her. He was about to cum himself, as he watched her, he realized that she had cum also, and her moans and groans told him that she liked what he was doing to her. Peter felt his balls contract and the hot cum surge into Alice as she continued to cum.</p> <p>Peter continued to thrust for a few minutes until his cock softened. He was afraid that he would be able to stay hard in the position for quite a way. Finally, he felt his cock slide from her cunt. She leaned forward on his chest as he rolled over with her. She kissed him, and she was a vision. She knew that she was still incredibly turned on. She held onto him tightly and whispered to him that she had never cum so strongly before.</p> <p>"Oh Peter. That was great." They laid there and talked for a few minutes as they both fell asleep for an hour. As he woke up, he heard his wife, talking softly to him and then kissing him goodbye. Peter got up and dressed as he was planning his next business meeting. When he got downstairs, he saw the most beautiful woman that he had ever seen standing at the bottom of the steps with a huge smile on her face.</p> <p>"Hi my dear, I am Alice. I had to see you. I am so thrilled and so grateful that you came along with me. I am having the best time of my life. Thank you." He walked her into the house, where he took her on to the couch and they were hugging each other as they had for the past thirty years. They spent the next couple of hours talking, laughing and touching and making out. When they had enough energy to go back to their own home, Peter had a few drinks and went to bed. As he lay in bed thinking about today, he had another brainstorm. It was one of those fantasy dreams that he had never really conceived of before. He told Alice that he had met another woman a few years before. It could have been a real thing since they never really did anything with the other. Peter had been faithful to his wife, although occasionally fantasizing about her the way he had with his wife. As it was not a fantasy, that had never happened.</p> <p>When he awoke in the afternoon, with his cock throbbing and standing up at attention, Alice had already showered. He noticed that she had put on a robe of some sort, and he assumed that she was dressing for bed. He was looking for her in the bedroom when she came downstairs. She came in and sat in the chair on the loveseat.</p> <p>"Hi, Peter." She said as she came down the stairs. She kissed him on the cheek and slipped in beside him. "How did you sleep," she asked.</p> <p>"Wonderful. Very nice. I slept for a while and then got up to shower. I did have you, this morning. When I went to have dinner with you, I heard that your new man was coming to town this week. I thought that you'd like him as well." He said to her as he felt his cock surge with arousal.</p> <p>Alice knew that it was about to happen, and she hoped that he felt the same way. "This weekend is your anniversary. We're supposed to get married Saturday. He is a nice guy. I'm not sure that he'd make it to Saturday night. I have some things to do in town that you're going to be here. What are you having?" She asked.</p> <p>"I was thinking of having an adventure for the weekend. Maybe a picnic, some dinner perhaps. I don't think that I'm ready for that yet." He answered. "What do you want me to bring? Wine? Wine glasses? Champagne?" He asked. He was hoping that they would get to see and hear everything that happened.</p> <p>"I don't know. What do you want?" Alice asked. "What if you have to be present for the birthday gift? Or, better yet, what if I am the present and you're the present? I'm sure that you would like to have a man, but don't worry if you're not what youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
