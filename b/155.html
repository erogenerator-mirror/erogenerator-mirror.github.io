She could see it in his eyes, but it was more instinct. "Please."</p> <p>For weeks he'd made love to her, but she couldn't get him out. He was her lover now, even a man could only take so much. Even if she couldn't believe it, she wanted him again.</p> <p>"Don't."</p> <p>"Please!" she pleaded, and he was so happy with her response. It seemed to him as if they were both doing it for a different reason, instead of being satisfied. He was still there, inside her, but she could feel it as well...</p> <p>She closed her eyes, and felt it build to the point where she would have sworn she could actually hear the sound of his cock sliding in and out of her, and every time he rammed it home she whimpered and panted. Each time she felt him pull almost all the way out, then push it back in.</p> <p>"Please!" she begged, and it was almost too much. It was the biggest thing she'd ever done. It was like she was afraid it would tear her in two. It was like a dagger she was tearing in her side, and one day when she heard the sound she was sure her own back was being sliced up.</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"Please." She repeated, as the intensity built to this point that it was almost pain. Tears rolled from her eyes, but the more and more tears came, the more she could feel it as if she were being stabbed in both ends.</p> <p>"It's too good!" Her voice came as a sigh, just a mere whisper at that. "Go on, do it."</p> <p>"No!" It was a whine, but one that he was going to let go, if she did. "Please. Let me do you."</p> <p>"No. You've got to do me," he insisted, and she thought he just wanted her to know. She wanted. "And you're going to do better than I ever imagine you could." She couldn't, not for the first time. She didn't know what it was, but she couldn't see anything, so she simply closed her eyes. "I mean it. I think you're going to be good."</p> <p>It wasn't a lie, it almost sounded as if it were his mantra, and it was all she could do to not beg him. "You're going to be a good wife. You're going to be..." Her sentence trailed away before it caught in her throat, and her shoulders went numb.</p> <p>The rest of it fell away, too, leaving her mind unable to comprehend where they had gone and no one to blame but themselves. Her pussy was so wet between her legs, she knew if she weren't already soaked so badly her panties were transparent. Even if it was just his cock, as surely that made it impossible to tell where the sounds were coming from.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" she exclaimed, her voice sounding like a mantra. She couldn't help the feeling of euphoria. "You'll make me..." Her voice trailed off, only to be joined by a soft curse, as he continued.</p> <p>"No," she sobbed, unable to believe her own words. She knew they were in his face, in the arms of the man she loved. How could she not take it? She felt as if she could do whatever it took to keep him.</p> <p>"No." It was all she could do to stop the tears, the tears, and the curse from coming. She couldn't control it, and she had to stop. No, this had to be a dream.</p> <p>She couldn't control it. No! That wasn't the curse! This wasn't about her, it was about him, of the love... of the love. The love. That was not what was there! The love. It looked like that, like a thing that just happened spontaneously, and she couldn't even begin to understand what it was. But it was not just sex that would make this love go away. It was a part of her, a part of everything.</p> <p>"No." It was an urgent shout. It was a command, and it was enough to do all of those things. She couldn't handle it. It didn't matter if he wanted it or not. She needed to get away. So now it was her job to get away, and not because her mind was trying to make her feel that way. She had to, she had to.</p> <p>Her shoulders shook with the effort. But somehow she managed to keep her mouth shut. It was hard to think clearly without his cock in her mouth, and if anything else seemed harder... but it wasn't something she could have imagined. "No." She had to get away.
