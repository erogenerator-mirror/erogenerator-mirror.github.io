"I'm sorry about that."</p> <p>"You could use a shave," I stated.</p> <p>"Well maybe," she sighed, then her eyes lit up, but she was still embarrassed. "But I'm on the pill..."</p> <p>"Why not stop worrying about that stuff and wait until the honeyed in and out of me."</p> <p>"I'm not really your honeyed. I'm the horny stuff."</p> <p>"Oh, that makes a difference. Like a man. You can kiss me in a way, and you can lick my sex until I cry!" I gave her a hug; she had no bra, and her breasts mashed against mine.</p> <p>"Well, I think it's a little sexy," she countered. "I've never even kissed a guy for real! I've only touched two guys before that. I'm still very much turned on, and I haven't really been fucked. Maybe I should practice being a little more adventurous in public."</p> <p>"Not at the party?"</p> <p>"No," she admitted. "After what we did to my friends yesterday, maybe I should go to the bathroom." She hesitated. "Well, maybe...." She looked around sheepishly.</p> <p>I reached out and pulled her to me, holding her gently as close as I could. "I guess you're going to join us later," I assured her. "It's still early in the evening."</p> <p>"I'm not that old. You were the one that said I shouldn't."</p> <p>"Don't take it to anyone who says it is okay to do that!" I was determined to go further than her wildest fantasies with her now. "Let's take a shower!" I pulled her close and we kissed once passionately.</p> <p>"Let's wait until the morning!" I was tempted to let her continue, but we were adults and her body language showed that she was not interested in leaving me.</p> <p>We showered, got dressed, and then I made us all breakfast. "Can I be your maid tomorrow?" Mom had been reluctant to dress a woman before, but once her experience with women turned her on, she went for it. "This will be your favorite uniform," I joked. I was already half hard and I was hoping that I would be able to perform again. Mom gave me a knowing smile, a look that said I was just getting started.</p> <p>"Are you sure you have the right equipment?" Mom was now getting suspicious. "This is your first day as a maid?"</p> <p>"Y-yes that is," I admitted.</p> <p>"You have all the tools you'll ever need and this is perfect," Mom smiled. "But I do really want to be your maid, not this 'young' boy."</p> <p>"It's not my parents' job to be your maid, Mom! I just love how it feels! It has been so long since I was at home!"</p> <p>"Well, you certainly aren't going out of your way to tell me what you think!"</p> <p>Mom went off to class while I continued to read up on the history of the Civil War. I had finished off the breakfast before my parents arrived. When Mom returned, we had the whole story. I told her about the experience with Karen and about the two hot babes that would soon be attending graduation. It made me feel like someone had just made the most wonderful decision for me.</p> <p>The conversation was light, and I found out that Mom liked the history of the Civil War. "I was always proud of it! I could still think of a picture of the two of them being naked, naked and on the grass with the fire blazing!"</p> <p>"I never got into it!" My mother laughed, but my mind was clouded with love, and the thoughts I now associated with her as a mother were just so very, very good to me.</p> <p>Before we had left, I had taken her to the dining hall to talk. She was as surprised as I was when we went there and she hugged me tightly. "Are we going to have sex today after all?" she asked when she stopped sobbing.</p> <p>"Maybe," I said, "but do you think I should? I'm not quite sure about the right woman, are you?" Mom had taken my breath away.</p> <p>"What happens if we go to college?" she asked, putting her arms around my neck and kissing me. "Does that mean we should go to college together?"</p> <p>"I'm sure that it could be arranged. We can be together at the wedding, you know."</p> <p>"Would you love to come to college with me?" Mom had a determined look on her face. "Wouldn't that have been great?" she asked. She was smiling at me, and her expression was one of loveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
