I am very happy that you are back, happy in spirit."</p> <p>"I will be back in a couple of weeks," she added then closed her eyes and went to sleep.</p> <p>I lay there wondering if she really meant that. I had just left her for another woman.</p> <p>The next day when I woke up, I was sure I had left my pills in her pocket but as I thought about what I was going to do I felt a twinge in my pants. It seemed that the morning was off but I didn't notice the clock.</p> <p>I heard her come in and when she came into the bathroom I quickly went to her. I kissed her and said, "I will pick you up when you are ready."</p> <p>"Yes I will be ready," she responded. "Good morning handsome."</p> <p>I took her to my car and parked in a secluded spot on the road. I got out to get the bags out and found something on the side table. When I looked up at her, I saw a little something that made my eyes water at first.</p> <p>It was a big box of condoms with a number on the bottom.</p> <p>I picked them up and put them in the car then I went for the door of her house and entered wearing only my robe and heels.</p> <p>I went inside and went to the refrigerator for a couple of drinks and then came back out and kissed her.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for you," she said smiling.</p> <p>"So have I," I responded.</p> <p>As we kissed and started to undo the belt on her robe, I had one arm around her as the other hand slowly and deeply caressed her body. A light touch was all it took to drive her wild.</p> <p>As we kissed and touched she began to open the last two buttons on her robe exposing her breasts for me. When her robe fell open, her breasts were magnificent.</p> <p>I had never been attracted to these breasts or even noticed women, but now I was going to kiss them and suck on her nipples.</p> <p>When her robe fell open and I saw her breasts and her nipples, all I could do was stare. They were magnificent.</p> <p>I could see her body beginning to awaken.</p> <p>I continued kissing her, sliding my hand down from her breasts to the hem of her robe.</p> <p>She began to squirm in anticipation as I felt the soft and warm touch of her hand upon my naked cock. I could feel it stiffen and throb.</p> <p>She put her hand over my cock to stop and asked, "Oh, what are you up to there, handsome? That is something new to me. I've never had two guys to play with."</p> <p>I could only respond by kissing her. Her hand slipped from my cock to my ass cheeks. I could feel her fingers brushing my crack. I felt warm and very feminine against my ass cheeks.</p> <p>I reached over to the table and got out two of the condoms.</p> <p>She pulled me toward her bedroom and I let her have her way. I got naked and followed and climbed on the bed.</p> <p>As I lowered my face to her breasts, I felt her hand on my cock and she pulled it toward her and began stroking me. I felt the pressure on my cock as she slowly lowered her hips letting my cock slide deep into her.</p> <p>We lay there together kissing and feeling each other for a few minutes more until we finally had a passionate and passionate and passionate kiss.</p> <p>At that point both women pulled their way from me and I rolled off to the side. We both smiled at each other.</p> <p>After a couple minutes while we kissed and talked, she said she was getting excited and that this would be her last night with me.</p> <p>"I know. I told you it would be good for all of us."</p> <p>"I agree." I responded.</p> <p>We both smiled at each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
