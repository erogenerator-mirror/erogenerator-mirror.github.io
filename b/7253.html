"I always thought it was such a shame you're not living."</p> <p>"The good news is, we're finally getting there. The good news is that I am finally going to be a woman. I've always thought it was so cool." You smile at me now, and I get the feeling a lot of things have changed for me. The changes are in deep thought and it looks good, though.</p> <p>You reach up and kiss me, gently, passionately. My heart is on the verge of racing now, I'm trying not to show any emotion. We stand in the doorway, gazing at each other. The first thing I know is you're holding me against the wall. I realize it's time to get you out of this. I look out at my bedroom. Your room is on the second floor, so we probably don't even get a chance to undress before we go to sleep.</p> <p>We stand there kissing for the longest time, and soon you are pulling me closer still. I feel your hardness up against me, and it feels good. Our kisses are long and deep, and our kisses turn to gasps of passion. I'm almost lost in the moment already, but you pull me to you, then, and we both fall back to the bed.</p> <p>I look over. The light is on in front of us, and I look up at your face, then up to my face and then back down. I'm smiling at you, and I can see your face. Your eyes are closed and your mouth is in a big O. Your lips are so soft and warm. Your face has gone from stern to soft and warm.</p> <p>It's a beautiful sight to behold, and I know I won't be able to keep the smile from making me crazy.</p> <p>I've never been a breast man. I'm not much into the aesthetics of them, but a woman's I like, anyway. I think they're pretty, though. Not as big as yours, but they're probably a good handful, and not at all saggy either. I'm never good at holding a hard dick like yours.</p> <p>I reach for them, and you reach for mine. I'm so surprised, we're completely naked in front of each other now, and I can barely remember the last place any of us would be for the next few hours. So I pull back and move down to lay next to you. In my haste, I didn't even notice at first. After all, I was already in your arms.</p> <p>"So, that you like my breasts?" I ask, still smiling and looking at yours. "I think you like them? I don't mind if you do. I was hoping to be able to do the same with yours."</p> <p>You let out a low groan, and start to kiss my neck. I let you do that for a while, and you reach around to gently cup and squeeze my breasts, which feel just like yours. If you just go around with your mouth and teeth, maybe I can find you a woman who likes them this way.</p> <p>After a while of that, I start to run my hands around, feeling your hardness under my hands.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, that looks nice."</p> <p>"Are you doing that because you like it?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it's the most sensual thing I've ever felt." And then I slide a finger down you until I touch you. You moan and lean up against me, so I slide one finger back down your hardness. "Oh, yeah!"</p> <p>At first, you look down, then back up at me. I kiss you again, and this time we're making out like teenagers. I don't know how to describe that, but it makes me very happy. I've always been attracted to a woman, but you have always been so kind and kind and sweet to me.</p> <p>But now with you, I've changed in some ways, too. I feel your hands on me, stroking them and spreading them, so they're sort of a natural extension of how I do mine. And all I can think of is how you have such soft hands.</p> <p>My kisses go back and forth with your mouth, and soon I'm tasting your lips and tongue, and it feels wonderful to me. I want to run my hand up over your hardness, but for a moment, I just want to feel your hands around me, but I hold back, because I'm happy you like my breasts. That you like to have your mouth and tongue and hands on me, too, makes me feel very good to you.</p> <p>Your hands are a bit rough, you've obviously been on a sexual high. But you do enjoy feeling my breasts, I hear in my head and in mine.
