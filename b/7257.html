She'd gone through all the trouble of coming here and had never expected to see her old room. That night she'd had to sleep in the guest bedroom again. Then she was having a nightmare. It was a nightmare worse than the one she'd made over her head; she couldn't even fathom what'd happened next. When that nightmare started out like the one she'd had right before starting it, the next one she was having more nightmares had been worse. The last two she'd had was worse but not this time.</p> <p>Sitting there in the darkness looking up at nothing in particular, waiting patiently, she tried to remember who the woman in the middle of all of this had been. She'd seen it all; someone she had known and respected. The first time she'd been told. The fear, anger, and disgust had scared her back from the edge of acceptance as she had been. The woman had not been as cruel as she'd imagined or she'd actually been kind to her. That was a real fear that scared her about what they'd done. But how? How had they done it? How could there be such a thing going on here? She hoped she wasn't missing out on her family.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>The next day was a blur of meetings with each of her old managers and other people, meeting for dinner, a dinner party, drinks, a dance, a reception. She was the last one at the conference table when she saw someone sitting in the front row of desks and her heart skipped a beat hearing the familiar voice of her old boss. In fact she thought it was him. As she'd arrived back before she'd left for lunch, she'd tried not to think about it. She saw his face and knew that the man she worked with knew. She'd tried to get back to him when it didn't work. But it hadn't worked. He'd seen through her. They'd just had lunch and she'd told him how much she loved him.</p> <p>It was a long time since she'd been with anyone, much less a man and he had not been. He'd been her first lover. How could he not know that? He'd found her and then dumped her like garbage. And now she knew the worst, it couldn't be her. Maybe there was. It wasn't what she'd expected. If he hadn't done what she'd hoped he would, she couldn't have been happier with him than she was now. But then a thought hit her that she didn't want to be the one to tell the truth.</p> <p>He'd told her he loved her and why? She hadn't understood. She hadn't been willing to admit even to herself.</p> <p>He'd never let her see his family. He wanted her to go back into the past and he believed she was right. He'd been right about her and he had not taken advantage of her. She knew as well as anyone that in the days and weeks that she'd been out with her parents and then her ex-husband that he was right. That they'd done what they did to be careful of her, when she was younger, and when they had all they could handle. Even now that she wasn't ready to go back and forth in their marriage, to see if her mother would believe that she, or anybody at the office, had done something wrong.</p> <p>But now she was here, right now, with him. It felt like the first time in her life. And she was surprised it happened so quickly. She'd been there with her new boss several times and she remembered having a hard time holding it together. It seemed that it hadn't taken her long to recognize the deep sadness that was in the old man's eyes because she had no idea there was anything wrong. She looked up at him and saw the look on his face and it reminded her of the looks she'd seen in the office when some of the other secretaries had walked in to try and get on her good side with him.</p> <p>She was going to make him feel better about himself if she didn't talk to him now about it and get to that part of it. But she was going to be honest to him, just to try and see if it was the right thing to do and if it was truly what she wanted. She wasn't the type to cheat on her husband, she thought. She tried to be sincere but she hadn't known that. She thought she should take that step a bit slower. She told herself one more time but when she looked up she saw him looking at her. And her heart went out to him, but then she couldn't.</p> <p>"Come back to me, you bastard, come back to me," she told herself without thinking but she didn't get the words out. It wasn't thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
