I asked.</p> <p>"You'll be with me," she replied. "I have some toys for you."</p> <p>I looked down at the floor and saw that the room just about emptied of clothes. We found the dresser and set the table.</p> <p>"Put your arm around me, Jack."</p> <p>I did it and then he did what he always done. My arms and legs were stretched over one another. I didn't know what I was doing by myself.</p> <p>"I can see you love me," he said. "I can see that. But you have to try everything else."</p> <p>I felt so stupid. I really did. I thought I was just a child. There's this one chance for everything to change. If I had a chance then. I wanted to try everything and I could see my mother was no longer my mother. She was no longer my mother.</p> <p>The sex life came to an end and it was as if my mother had been transformed into something alien. Now, as she lay there, I could see that she had a long life ahead of her.</p> <p>"Mom, let's try something else. I want something different for tonight."</p> <p>I couldn't refuse her anything. She looked up at me, the beautiful blonde girl that I loved. Without words, she nodded. I felt a tiny bit sick but, somehow, I couldn't help it.</p> <p>"Mom, we can do it and it'll be wonderful," I said.</p> <p>"You're sure? I hope," she replied. "I love you, Jack, I need you to love me."</p> <p>The bed was huge.</p> <p>"Come here my darling," I said. "I'm sorry if I'm going to be too much for you."</p> <p>"I'm not, Jack," she said.</p> <p>Her hands moved slowly up and down my body. Her hands were so soft. Her touch was so intimate.</p> <p>"Come here and hold me," I suggested.</p> <p>I looked down at her and wanted her so badly. There were no limits to love anymore. The only thing between me and the one I love would be a beautiful woman with a happy life.</p> <p>Kirsten was all that I'd been ready for. I needed nothing left. My mother was going crazy with everything that had happened. I wanted nothing to hold it together for the rest of my life because that, what she was offering was too good for anything good.</p> <p>I held her and we stayed there. She wanted to go to sleep but that was impossible. Not only was she sleeping in my arms, she was sleeping with me. It was too much. I couldn't let her go. I was going to hurt her and I was going to hurt her as much as I could.</p> <p>She was too young to know what I meant. It just didn't seem right. I was not sure about what I was getting. Then, Kirsten was all that I wanted in a woman. A wonderful woman. She didn't matter that much to me at the time. Everything was for her. She was too young to feel anything.</p> <p>"Jack," I said. "Mom, I love you to much to have you this way. Let me show you everything I love to do to you."</p> <p>She looked up at me and I felt her hands on me once more. They were so soft but so strong. They seemed to know what I was thinking. I held her in my arms in order for her to hold me back. I felt that she knew what I was feeling and had not hesitated before.</p> <p>The sex I had not experienced in some time started to make sense again. I couldn't believe how good she felt. Her hands were on me like someone had a velvet glove to put my soul. She had my body in her hands almost like her own. I held her and she held me back and made me feel like I was the only one with whom I could feel.</p> <p>My mother was beautiful after her ordeal with my father. I was glad she had her own life to give. I had given her a chance to have what she needed. The woman to whom she wanted to be loved was a beautiful woman who made me feel the same. I couldn't feel anything but her.</p> <p>My own mother was everything that I loved. She was all that mattered to me. She wasn't just the woman I wanted in my dream. She was beautiful and she brought a smile to my face as she held me close. I held onto her with all my heart and she never got tired of that.</p> <p>She was everything that I needed in the bedroom. I loved her and she me.</p> <p>Kirsten was also everything thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
