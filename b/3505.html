I was just as upset that I had been forced to do what she had done. I wasn't really angry that she had taken advantage of my parents, but I wasn't sure whether she was trying to manipulate me or was truly hurt.</p> <p>I went back to class and watched Mrs. Jackson. She was in a class and she had never looked quite so angry in her years. Every time I looked over at her, I could see her lips move and her eyes move, but it was as though a force hypnotized her. It was odd. The way she was talking or talking only made it all that much clearer.</p> <p>After class she finally looked up at me and said, "John, I've just been through a tearful experience and, you know, you have something to thank me for. I hope you don't mind me telling you that? That we haven't had a chance to talk for a while, but I feel that we both need to talk."</p> <p>I said, "I was just kidding, Mrs. Jackson, but, I'm afraid I won't listen."</p> <p>I stood up and walked back to her desk.</p> <p>I sat there for what seemed like forever. She was standing over me, her back to me, talking and laughing and I was sitting there totally unable to say anything about what had gone on between us.</p> <p>After about twenty minutes she said, "I know I have to have some time to myself, but now that I am a bit older, when can I talk to you again? I will talk to you about all of this."</p> <p>We continued to sit there talking, neither of us wanting to stop talking.</p> <p>Then she stood up and said, "John, I'm sorry. I can't go on anymore without talking. I promise I will talk to you next week."</p> <p>"Yes, Mrs. Jackson, we can get up now and I will listen to all of this. I promise you."</p> <p>"I was only kidding. Go ahead while you are trying to get my mind off of things, then I want to talk to you about this."</p> <p>I started telling her how I felt and when to talk to her about anything.</p> <p>About an hour later she walked into the room and said, "Well, John, we've got a lot to teach you. Now that I think we can go on with a few hours of class, might you be a little more relaxed now."</p> <p>She kissed me on the cheek and then left.</p> <p>I sat there for the next twenty minutes or so. I couldn't believe what a turn on it was to have a beautiful mature woman in my arms. But I still couldn't believe the lust I felt for this woman. I couldn't believe the excitement of a man's erection pressed into the small of her back. She didn't even flinch at any of it. I didn't want to stop.</p> <p>She was looking at me with those beautiful eyes, then suddenly she turned away. "John," she started, "I really don't want to talk about anything personal. Right now, if we haven't talked about it, I've got an idea."</p> <p>Now it was my turn to blush, and my face was bright red. "But, Mrs. Jackson, we still haven't done anything like that"</p> <p>"John, of course we haven't. It will be best if you just listen to me for a time; we haven't even had any more foreplay, so please don't be so embarrassed, but you have been acting more like a shy young boy who just wanted to see what it would have been like to kiss a woman."</p> <p>That made me feel good, but I couldn't believe how excited I was getting. I couldn't believe this was a conversation we were going to have.</p> <p>"But" I started, "I was hoping you didn't think I was interested in making love to a woman."</p> <p>"Well, you didn't get any pleasure from it in the past, so you can't expect me to give you one."</p> <p>"Well, maybe we can do something about that." I said as I rose from the chair and began pulling up my shirt.</p> <p>"No, no," she said. "I can't go on without talking about what you've done. I need to know all of your business."</p> <p>I pulled myself up and went on "You can tell me about what happened between us, but we can't do anything more about the rest of this. We are just going to have to talk about things and see that we are through before we can make any progress."</p> <p>She looked at me with a mixture of concern and a little excitement in her eyes. "But John, you really are a nice young man, aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
