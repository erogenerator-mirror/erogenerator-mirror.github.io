There were a lot of things I liked. Not just in sex. That was what I was feeling at the moment. I just enjoyed it, though. But I would have to wait before I ever fucked this girl.</p> <p>I began to move up and down slowly and she began to moan louder as it got harder and harder inside her. I kissed her right back and kept kissing her shoulder as my body began to jerk and shake in anticipation of another orgasm. She moved her mouth back to mine, allowing my tongue to probe hers open. I felt her tongue against the tip as my hand moved from her tit. The head of my cock began to throb as a long orgasm started to build. The softness of her tits and her soft mouth and her pussy against my cock was making me cum faster and harder. One moment I wasn't sure she'd cum, and then again she seemed too good. I was just about to pull out and then she would be satisfied I'd given her what she wanted.</p> <p>I had only been laying for five minutes, and my wife's friend had just gone home to change into something a little more comfortable. I didn't get any sleep the next day that I'd been with my wife. My heart raced in my chest as I lay there thinking about my wife in a bedroom with no other woman. I was going to try this again somedayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
