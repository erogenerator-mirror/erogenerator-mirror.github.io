My fingers brush over them a second before I move to her hips and start lifting her to place her over my face. She places her hands on my head and rests her palms on my cheeks, giving me the warm comfort and comfort of her hand as I suck her clit and tongue her pussy again as she is now moaning, "Oh Yes, Sir. I need to cum so badly for you. I'm Cumming for you." I can feel her body shaking and she is thrashing beneath me as my face continues her orgasm. Her moans are louder now from my tongue fucking her as her body trembles with pleasure.</p> <p>When she calms down a little I stop and I lay beside her, my heart pounding, wondering what I did wrong. I think it was all so new to me, but I was feeling very good about this situation and I knew I could not do anything to change it. I told myself that I must ask myself, "Why are we doing this?" but again I knew that her situation wasn't right, so I gave her the answer of the question I hoped to answer but I was afraid. All I could think was, "Is she my baby and is her happiness really worth it?" I think that may have been the answer she needed but I could not find the courage to make up for it.</p> <p>After a few minutes she looks at me, smiles and asks, "How does it feel to be able to do those things with someone?" It was then that I realized that I had just agreed to do this and that I might be unable to keep this promise of giving this man something which I had yet to achieve.</p> <p>I look at her for a moment, trying my best to find the words to describe the feelings I had for her. I tell her, "I feel so bad right now that you are not here giving me what I want. I guess I shouldn't have done it, but I guess I should tell you that I am looking for happiness in a happy situation, just like with you."</p> <p>She smiles, "Thank you for talking to me. I hope I can please you with my voice." I think she is hoping that the two years of loneliness that I have been feeling were gone. My heart pounds that I am glad that she has listened to me and she is happy to know that I really like what she has done.</p> <p>She looks at me, "I still can't believe what we have done, but I am not really upset. I've enjoyed the sex with him. A lot and I really am tired and I am not ready to go any further. I promise you I will never want to see you again. What we did, I don't understand at all." I agree, "We have done everything, I really hope you can understand that I truly love you. I can't think of a word about how wonderful you were and I can't imagine ever wanting to see you again. Let me know if you want to go back out there again, we could do this again."</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir. I really mean that. I do have to find some way I will not want to keep you from your work. And with the two years of loneliness I have had, I don't feel ready to take up the offer of your marriage."</p> <p>I tell her I don't have any other plans and that it is all in the past. I can't wait to see her again. She smiles and kisses me on the lips, "Are you trying to say that you think I am going to marry you or am I?" I told her, "Well, perhaps it will be easier to say that when you are on your knees and begging. I love you and I know how much you want me. I never wanted to hurt you if I couldn't love you the way that I want you to.</p> <p>She tells me that she still loves me. She's hoping that she can make me happy after this and that I would have the love to let the world know how much she meant to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
