The voice that came from the back of the hall was a little more like the words I'd heard the night before.</p> <p>"Well, what's on my mind?" He sounded irritated. I didn't know how to answer him, so I looked down and answered him. "No, I didn't fuck him, you asshole. I just walked out on him the other day, you piece-of-shit," I lied to him. "So you just stood there, just stared at him for a minute or two and then walked out? No, I didn't see your face; I thought that you were just being polite about it." He was right, I didn't look that young anymore. I guess it's best not to tell people like that.</p> <p>"You're not helping the situation, I guess."</p> <p>"Sure he is, is, uh..." I wasn't sure where this was going, but I was willing to play along if I had to.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, it all started because one of my coworkers left the office, and he was walking through the ladies room, looking at his phone before getting into a nice, expensive restaurant. He walked right past me, not looking at me anymore, and when he did I heard a woman's voice saying her name, 'Cum, cum, cum' and then a laugh to my ear. It made me feel really good, so I didn't say anything, and he just walked out, leaving me alone." He smiled, "And then, I figured the girl might have left a voice for him, but she never told me her name, so I didn't even hear her, if that's how you're thinking. I was about to come out of the bathroom when they walked past me, and then I watched, because if I hadn't been watching so long I could have been able to look at his eyes all the way through the mirror. But in the end I was too scared to take a breath, just sat there and looked."</p> <p>"And then?"</p> <p>"And then I felt that way again for the rest of the day, and I was going home, thinking I'd never see him again, thinking maybe I would be able to convince myself that he was my dream."</p> <p>"And then..."</p> <p>"Then the other girl?"</p> <p>"Yes, that was her name? You're thinking I'm her, aren't you?"</p> <p>I thought, this is a crazy little game we're playing but I'll go with it. "Yes, you're thinking that I'm her, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I am, but what a way to be! She's my friend's sister, she probably thinks I'm just someone she's been flirting with before she came to work; that is she was here last night and then she went to the bathroom and I've come home early."</p> <p>"So does that mean that you're just some stranger?"</p> <p>"I guess it does, sometimes." I didn't say anything, not sure how to talk about this.</p> <p>"You mean about how my work with his clients has been really, really bad?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"About how many clients you've been with." I thought it over. He'd always been really busy. He was just one of those guys. "That's the other part of what happened, right?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, but it's not all the same." He sounded hurt and confused, and I didn't know why.</p> <p>"I don't mean that." I had to know this.</p> <p>"That you've had to sit there staring at the ceiling all day waiting for me to tell you everything that happened? It's like I say it, you dumb shit. You think that I'm just someone I'm flirting with and not because you think I'm a jerk?"</p> <p>I thought about this. "What does that make you?" He seemed sincere, but maybe I was wrong.</p> <p>"Well, you know. The last few hours, yeah, I admit it," he seemed upset, "and when I told you the first time that I had a chance to hook up with a guy and I was going to get some attention and then you walked in; and then you called me a loser, I'd like to think that it wouldn't actually have been that much different. But I don't mean anything by it, well, you're right. I mean, I'm just not sure what I feel or what I believe. I know that it was just a case of things sort of falling out between the two of us, and I don't know what's going to happen; or where we'll go from here, otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
