"I'm so sorry, Chris." A little more than an hour ago I thought I'd seen only the tip of a cock, now that we were even, but no, I was definitely the exception. As I sat, feeling very awkward, tears rolling down my face, he pulled me to him and kissed me.</p> <p>To say I was shocked by his touch was an understatement. It wasn't soft and gentle or the slightest brush of his lips, no, it was firm, demanding, and almost demanding. I wasn't sure of what was, what was wrong, but I didn't care. He'd kissed me deeply once before, but it was still new, so passionate, so intense, and yet so different.</p> <p>"We're only here for the weekend, Chris. I promise." We kissed again.</p> <p>It felt like forever before he released me. I looked at him, my face red with shame, his eyes dark with lust. He stood. "I think it's time we consummate our relationship," he said, unbuttoning his pants.</p> <p>He undid his belt and zipper, and pulled his cock free. It didn't take much for the first hard inch to meet my tongue tip, as it brushed it. I moved my head forward, so I could kiss and lick the head, but before I could, he pushed me away again. "Suck me."</p> <p>I stopped moving, my head down again, but he reached down and grabbed my hair, and again yanked my face back. "Suck me. I don't have all day, and I don't like to disappoint."</p> <p>I opened my mouth and took him in, and he started to say something, but his hands made his words unnecessary. I sucked him, as I always had, bobbing my head back and forth over his cock. It was a pleasure, and I hadn't had one this intense in a long time. He pushed up, trying to be a good boy, and I took him deeper than he was.</p> <p>He was breathing hard, so I pulled off for a moment. "I want to fuck your mouth," he said. He held his cock at the tip of my chin, and I moved closer, trying to take as much of him in my mouth as I could, but that would have to wait... I wanted to swallow.</p> <p>I felt him lean closer, and I turned my head. "Wait for me, please." I took his hand, and moved the head of his cock through my lips. He held my head, and I moved him down, and pushed him back. "Don't try to take it all, Chris. I want to feel you down there."</p> <p>He leaned further back, and he pulled me further down on his cock. I could feel his pubic hair against my face, and he lifted one of my breasts, letting me have full access to it. I wrapped my legs around him as I started to move. I was hungry, and he was ready to fuck my throat, and I needed his cock.</p> <p>He leaned over and started to kiss my neck, biting on the soft flesh there as I pushed myself up on my toes. When I felt his hands come around to my ass, I couldn't hold off any longer. Before I knew it, his hands had grabbed my breasts, making me gasp, and I felt my vagina moisten as he pounded my cunt. He pulled my hips sharply, so that I knew he was close, and I started to move quicker, faster.</p> <p>I lost it, and I heard myself screaming, "I'm coming—right down your throat," as he pushed hard into me and filled me completely. I could feel his cock throbbing as it ejaculated, and I had never felt anything that intense with him inside me, and yet it was amazing. I was still shaking and breathing hard, until he softened, and pulled me back to him.</p> <p>"I'll never forget your taste in my mouth," he told me, as he kissed each part of my lips.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>"I want to be a part of this, and you too," Chris said, sitting back in his seat, and looking through the window as if there was going to be no room at the end of the drive. He turned and looked at me again. "I think it's important that we establish a relationship, one that neither one of us can break." My lips quivered at his blunt, precise words.</p> <p>It was a strange and wonderful thing to think about, that this guy had been in this situation before and was in the middle of a sexual relationship with me, before we'd even gotten married. I took a sip of wine, and looked back to him. "I am open for business, Chris," I told him—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
