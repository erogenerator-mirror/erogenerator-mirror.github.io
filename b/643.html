Finally I had to pull completely out of her. She took a deep breath, then looked at me.</p> <p>"Now... I want to take a shower."</p> <p>She looked back around the pool to watch me walk off after. She smiled to herself.</p> <p>I took one of the last of my things I had brought and followed her back into the bathroom. As she began to step into the shower, she pulled her bathrobe almost completely off, tying it back in the front. We both giggled, then turned to find him in the shower.</p> <p>"Oh... look at you." he said as he looked at me.</p> <p>I laughed. "I know."</p> <p>Then, still in the shower, I pulled off my shorts. She turned around and pulled the bathrobe back the way it had been. We both gasped at the thought that this would be a first for me. His cock was hard in his hand as he stared at my nude body.</p> <p>"Well that does it," he said, as he took a step closer to me.</p> <p>I turned and looked at her at his cock in his hand, then back at her. She still had her bathrobe on, but then she looked down to her feet.</p> <p>"My feet are dirty." she said, as she stepped toward his cock.</p> <p>He looked up at her and saw her reaction and smiled.</p> <p>"Go ahead. It's dirty."</p> <p>She smiled back at him, letting him look at her feet, then up to her eyes. She smiled at him as he walked toward her so she could wash herself.</p> <p>"I love doing this," she said as she reached to grab his cock.</p> <p>"Me, too." he said with a grin, then stopped at the toilet seat.</p> <p>"Don't," she said. "I want to do this myself."</p> <p>I just smiled.</p> <p>She took his hand and began to soap herself as he slowly cleaned himself.</p> <p>"I'll get to it when I get out," she said as she finished cleaning herself.</p> <p>He grabbed his towel and began walking toward me. I was standing in front of her holding my cock. As he stood in front of her I reached down and began touching myself.</p> <p>"Don't," she said as she turned me around toward the tub. "Just do what I tell you, honey."</p> <p>He turned around to face me and we kissed passionately. I ran my fingers up her back until I reached her hair. I ran my finger through that thick bush, then pulled my fingers back and started with her neck and lightly touched her breasts. I could feel her nipple growing harder under my touch as he pulled her away from the tub.</p> <p>"You still have your bathrobe on, honey." he said.</p> <p>She looked me in the eyes for a while, then gave him an apologetic smile.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I said.</p> <p>"Nothing. I was just wondering..."</p> <p>"Don't you dare," I said sternly.</p> <p>She turned and looked into his eyes.</p> <p>"I'm not the problem, Mike." she said. "I just want to try a lot of things."</p> <p>His cock began to twitch as he realized.</p> <p>"Well... why don't you let him do it?" he said. "You can do any or all of it yourself."</p> <p>"Good idea," she said.</p> <p>He was looking down at her chest as she turned towards him. She turned back while rubbing her hands down his back. He grabbed her by the waist and turned her in the opposite direction of where she had been sitting. As they began to walk toward the tub we both stared at the cock that had formed in his left hand.</p> <p>"You didn't wear it out of the swimming pool," she said as she felt the weight of his penis. "This..."</p> <p>She took his hand and moved it to her pussy. He immediately moved his hand down to stroke it as he looked into her eyes. I felt her press into his hand.</p> <p>"Well," she said. "It doesn't look like I'm wet right now."</p> <p>He stepped into the tub and let her slide around him a little. As he stepped in she pulled her legs up onto his body. As she was bent over the edge of the tub she could see right into his robe. He lifted his left leg over hers so she could straddle him. His left leg was around her waist, and his right one was on the top of mine. She leaned her head back. He put his right hand to the wall, placing his hand on her back, and pushed her forward. Slowly they began to move in unison as he moved the glass of the shower head to herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
