I can't get hard. That would be too easy to do. The only way I could get that thing up and keep going was by pulling on it." She rubbed his thigh softly, causing his member to stiffen in her hand. "But it feels so good when I play with you. And when I rub you all over, I can feel it hardening right against your ass." She reached under the seat, grabbed his cock, put her other hand up under his legs, and began slowly rubbing the head of his cock up and down her slippery slit. "Mmmhmmm." She moaned, putting her fingers on his lips to silence him. "You do like it when I play with it." She licked her lips. "It's all for you, honey. Can I put it in?"</p> <p>He shook his head, unable to speak. "No."</p> <p>"No?"</p> <p>He couldn't seem to muster any sort of denial. She smiled and spread her wetness. "I don't think you're getting enough anymore, hun."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"It's just that..."</p> <p>She kissed him. "Just one more thing. You'll get what you want today. Your big cock inside me. And I'll let you fuck my brains out." She smiled. "Mmmhmmm." She lifted her ass a little, presenting him with the most beautiful, wet, pink, shaved mound that ever existed. "And your tongue."</p> <p>He looked at her. "What?"</p> <p>She smiled. "Just think about sucking your cock right now, honey." She moved closer to him, still sitting in the chair. He couldn't see her face, but couldn't resist rubbing his cock once, twice, three times against her clit, over her nipples, over her stomach. She moaned, and put her hand on his head to look him in the eye. She gave him a seductive smile. "And how does the taste of your cock make you feel?"</p> <p>He couldn't explain it any longer. This was his wife's best friend's wife, his ex-wife! "What do you think?" He said.</p> <p>"Do you believe it?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I really get it -- every time. "</p> <p>"Good. That was the best. And I'll tell you another part of my little game. I'll ask some questions, a small one, just to keep you from fucking my ass. And if you're a good boy, I'll let you fuck it whenever you want. Is that okay with you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, that sounds awesome. I'll make you a deal."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yep, babe. Don't get defensive. You won't leave, that's all, right?"</p> <p>"I won't get defensive. Just you understand, hon. I'll do it just for you." He winked at her.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jillian ran her fingers down his chest as they talked. "I can't believe how much it turned me on. We don't have to do this anymore. I'm not your wife, you know."</p> <p>He laughed. "I know. I can't believe I'm actually doing this to you, too. I just really don't have to be married to it yet." When she saw that, she grinned again.</p> <p>"Well, I'll admit that. " And they shared a laugh, kissing gently, both of them looking at his hand caressing her leg, sliding up her thigh. "Mmmmmmm."</p> <p>"What's your game this time?"</p> <p>"Oh. I have one right here." She looked at the video camera. "Now I know why you're sitting there in that chair. Are you getting hard?"</p> <p>"That depends entirely on what I think about."</p> <p>"I thought you might say that." She put her hand on her leg. "Now, I think you would like that. I think you'd like me to just play with myself while you use your tongue right here on me to make me come." Her hand moved slowly up and down his shaft, then back up again, and he felt her hand on his face. "Well, let's see what happens when I think of it a little differently. I think you can handle this." She grabbed his cock and began stroking it faster and faster. Finally, she leaned all the way forward, pressing her breasts into his arm. He couldn't keep his hand from touching her, and just watched, smiling. She moaned, pressing his cock against her hard clit.</p> <p>"I can feel your cock. You want me to do it, don't you, babeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
