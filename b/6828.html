"We haven't even kissed, I've just given you oral sex. And, I can do it, as sure as I could do it before, here," I teased, holding her chin between my hands, making her look me in the eyes, and then running my tongue on her lower lip, licks down to her soft little tongue in my mouth. "And, I think we do have a few things that can go well together. Let's do, what ever we want to, and I think that we both, should be able to have a very enjoyable time," I whispered and then kissed my way to her neck.</p> <p>"Mmmm," I felt her shudder and her arms fell to her side.</p> <p>I licked and kissed all around my neck, and down to her collarbone and around her breast, finally nuzzling against the valley of her breast, feeling her nipple harden under my tongue. I took a nipple into my mouth, feeling it harden to my mouth. I closed my mouth around the other one and felt her shiver against me, and then I repeated the process on the right one.</p> <p>"Mmmm," I heard her say again, and ran my tongue around her nipple. "I think," I said, "that we both should be able to keep this going a very long time. This feels a bit like sex, for sure, but this feels a lot better," I said, licking and gently caressing my hand down the side of her stomach. I traced around the edge of her panties, and then slid around her soft pubic hair and over the top of her pussy, making sure to touch a very moist spot. Then I reached around and up and pulled at the waistband of her panties a little, pulling my hand back until I could get the other side. And then I slid my hand around to her clit and held myself in there as I kissed down her neck.</p> <p>"I want you to stay in a little longer," I whispered and pulled her pussy-covered leg back up until I could get both legs up. I stood up; it felt like she was standing there in mid-air, her head back into the chair just outside the door. "Hold on and kneel down for me," I whispered and let her put her feet into spread eagle position, then I looked back at her face, seeing her eyes closed and her head rocking slowly back and forth. "Kneel down again, I want to start something, don't you?" I said, and she quickly did, kneeling in the chair and placing her head on the arms.</p> <p>"Well, what do you think of that?" I said, pulling out a bottle of lube and putting some on my own finger. "It looks, like, a nice looking vibrator," I said, handing one of the bottles over, "and I think that this is the perfect thing for first base sex, as well." I reached back and pushed one finger up into her pussy as I pressed the dildo against her opening. "It's got to be a really nice vibrator, don't you think?" I asked, smiling at her, and then pushed in another finger. "You know, don't you." I said and reached for my bottle again, pouring some on my own, and began stroking my cock.</p> <p>"I like the look of you doing this for me, lover," I heard from behind me and turned to see my best friend standing on the other side of the hall. I quickly got up from the chair, walking to get my cock out, and took a step back, as she had done. When I stopped in front of her, she reached down and wrapped her fingers around the base of my dick as she leaned down and licked her lips. "You want it?" she said and I nodded. "Just let me know before we start to," she said and I walked her to the front door and we got inside as I pulled her to me, and we went around to the other side, where I turned to let my cock slide along her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Now what? I thought we were going to do a little bit of a double penetration." I said and her hand on mine, led me to the sofa, where she sat down and reached for the remote. "So you wanted to be my girl-in-the-house tonight?" she asked and smiled. "That's what I was looking for," I said and we both turned the volume off again, just a little bit and watched as her mouth opened and she slid her tongue quickly along her lips. "I've already got some for you, but I want to try something else, too," I said quickly as I stood up from the sofa and helped her up, still rubbing my dick along her pussy lips. "It would be really nice if you would take myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
