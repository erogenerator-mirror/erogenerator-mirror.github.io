I thought it could be fun."</p> <p>"I don't want you to go," Jake interrupted.</p> <p>"Why, because of the way our son is taking care of you?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Jake, you always treated me like a kid. You never would treat me like a princess or anything."</p> <p>"It's just you are a princess? No one else ever has princesses before!"</p> <p>Jake just walked over to the sofa and sat on it. "No princesses have my mommy!"</p> <p>"That doesn't matter anymore."</p> <p>"I can't!" Jake grabbed his mother by her hair. "You don't have a princess at all! You're not a princess! That's the last thing it will take to wake up from the slumber party tonight."</p> <p>"Well what if I don't?" she cried out.</p> <p>Jake just leaned up and kissed her on the lips, leaving a wet trail on her cheek. "Don't worry, little princessy. You didn't wake up did you?"</p> <p>"What the hell did you just say?"</p> <p>"I kissed you!" he said.</p> <p>Jake ran out the door as fast as his shoes would carry him and into the living room. "I told you to come with me," he yelled into his ear.</p> <p>A confused expression ran across his face, but his eyes remained fixated on his mother. "So, you really think I should take this up with your sister?"</p> <p>"You know it's not so much that!"</p> <p>"But you are my princess, aren't you? We are still a part of each other are we not? Your sister would never want to meet a guy like you."</p> <p>"Well if I'm not supposed to take you out to dinner tonight we are going to take a shower!" She stood up and walked out of Jake's vision. "Jake would you like to eat at home tonight? We have all night if you don't want to make a mess."</p> <p>Jake just rolled his eyes. It wasn't fair. "It's a date." Jake walked off through her kitchen towards his room.</p> <p>A slight smile crossed her face when she realized that his dinner plans weren't for two. She got to her knees and started to work for the stove. Jake watched her as she looked down at herself. She was a full figured beauty. Her long blonde hair flew out of the pan and cascaded around her face. She was an unbelievably sexy and hot woman that no one would ever forget. When she saw that she started to get up but Jake blocked her hands with his.</p> <p>"Dinner ok?" he asked.</p> <p>Jake kissed her on the forehead. This woman was so incredibly sexy that he couldn't wait to see her again, even if it were only for dinner with her parents. He started to undress himself so that he would not go back on his promise of what he would do to her tomorrow. His thoughts were of her right now. He knew he wanted her. He wanted to see what she looked like in his arms. He wanted to kiss her. He wanted to make love to her. He wanted to make love to her on their marriage night.</p> <p>"I know I'm tired, sweetie," he said.</p> <p>"Well then we should start," she said. Jake took his place in the recliner. His mind was focused on thinking about her all day, but his thoughts stayed locked into a place that was completely foreign to him. The only thing he could think was how perfect he felt and his only answer was to turn everything upside down. As he thought about her body he reached for his cell phone and started to count to 100 when he suddenly had an idea.</p> <p>"What the fuck is going on? What's going on with you?" He looked away from the stove and watched as he heard someone walking up the street towards his door.</p> <p>"Are you crazy? There should be people looking in on us!" the man said.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah, no one is looking at us," Jake answered.</p> <p>"Come on over, Jake. We have got to get to dinner." The man walked by his room and shut the door.</p> <p>Jake was about to follow him when he heard another woman's voice. "Is something wrong? Are you crazy? Jake asked his mother in the living room.</p> <p>"Yeah," she answered. "It's the girls' night out, you know. Mom and Dad are coming home this weekend."</p> <p>It hit Jake right then. He would be spending the night at her house. She and her parents would not even knowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
