When I felt my body relax and feel the water flow over my skin, I ran my hands over my body again, taking special care to apply soap to every part. I stepped out of the shower and stood there for a moment. I didn't even bother drying off as I dried my hair and body.</p> <p>I heard the shower door close and looked up at Ryan as I stepped into the bedroom. We stood there looking each other up and down and finally smiled up at each other for a few moments.</p> <p>"What are you up to?" Ryan finally asked.</p> <p>"Making spaghetti," I replied.</p> <p>"Just dinner on the house, I have some other chores to do," he responded.</p> <p>"Great!" I answered as my eyes roamed over his naked body. He was only wearing a pair of boxer shorts, which were slightly sagging in relation to his body. His muscles were glistening and he was looking down at me like I was the most beautiful girl.</p> <p>He took a hold of the remote control and turned the music off to an inane, monotonous level. He picked up a large sponge and poured some suds on my body. I was startled at first and then got turned on when he started washing me. I jumped as he started washing the area between my legs and I started to moan loudly when he started sucking on my dick.</p> <p>"Ryan, you're a sick fuck!" I moaned as suddenly he had his mouth wrapped around my penis, which was already semi erect by the time I said it. He held my penis and started sucking it. I grabbed onto his hips and pulled him toward me. Without waiting, I shoved his face down onto my dick. When I pulled his mouth off me, he looked up and smiled widely.</p> <p>"What are you up to, Ryan?" I asked him.</p> <p>"I'm going down on it, now," he said.</p> <p>I didn't answer him, as if I expected him to. Instead, I let him do whatever he wanted until I felt myself start to come.</p> <p>"Ryan," I said softly.</p> <p>"Oh don't worry about telling me," he said.</p> <p>"But I really don't feel like going down on you. I'm gonna fuck you. Just like you did me," I said a little too eagerly.</p> <p>"Oh, you're already so tight, but that's okay. I'll just get up on my knees and let you slide that thick wet monster into me someplace else," he smiled wickedly at me.</p> <p>I didn't care, I needed this dick in me. He stood up, threw me onto the bed and grabbed the elastic of his boxer shorts. He pulled them down slowly, revealing a raging erection that stuck out a full seven inches. My eyes widened as I saw his cock head and it was much bigger than the ones that looked like they'd had sex a long time ago. I looked on with a combination of shock, amusement and excitement mixed with trepidation. The next thing he did surprised me.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" he asked, but quickly added. "Just be gentle."</p> <p>"No." I didn't say a word. I simply nodded my head.</p> <p>He grabbed my cock and slowly slipped it into his mouth. When it was a good eight inches in, he wrapped his lips around the head, started sucking on the shaft, and started working his lips up and down the shaft. If he continued like that a few more times, he would pull it out of his mouth, lube it up, and stick it in me. I could tell by the sounds and the way he was sucking on my member that he could do that too.</p> <p>Ryan was pretty good at his job, at the same time doing exactly what I was doing. When he worked his lips around my shaft, I watched as he started to bob his head just the way I loved. He was sucking like a pro, and I was getting close to cumming. I knew I wouldn't last long, so I quickly took his head and placed it between my legs, guiding it while he went down as he went up. After a few moments, I knew I was ready to cum.</p> <p>"Ryan, I'm gonna explode!" I warned him.</p> <p>He just smiled, removed his mouth and turned around to straddle me and position himself on top of me. I grabbed onto the bed frame for support, while he got behind me and rubbed that huge head of his against my asshole. He teased my cock by rubbing the head against my hole a little bit, never entering me. He slowly pushed the head into me and started rubbing my dick, making me ready to fuck me in the ass. It took only a couple of minutes toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
