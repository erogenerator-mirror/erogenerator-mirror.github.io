Her body convulsed over and over again, each time ending in a massive orgasm. Every movement, every movement, seemed to last for a good five to ten minutes that ended with him finally emptying his load into her.</p> <p>He collapsed on top of her, gently kissing her lips and her neck. She was in a daze. It had been incredible for her to feel him inside her like this. They lay there for a minute, just enjoying the feel of each others bodies and basking in the afterglow of their passion. Eventually, David rolled away, moving up onto his side, facing her.</p> <p>He pulled her close and kissed her soft lips. "I love you," he said.</p> <p>"I love you too," she replied, not wanting to end the session. She felt him moving the straps of her night gown off her shoulders; she let her arms go slack as they went. They kissed passionately as she felt his huge dick come back to life.</p> <p>She felt him moving between her legs, entering her from behind. She squeezed her eyes shut as he entered her from behind. His big dick made her feel like she hadn't been fucked in a while, yet somehow there was an incredible warmth that enveloped him. He started moving slowly at first, gaining momentum. It felt so good to both of them, but she was so aroused that she didn't want to let him off, and she could only imagine what a cum-slurping she looked like, so she had to focus not to make any noise. He moved with a swift, efficient rhythm that she found to be very erotic and thrilling. She was in a state of constant arousal that made it difficult to resist. They were both breathing heavy as he pounded into her, making her body move in sync with his thrusts. Eventually, he pulled all the way almost out of her and flipped her over so she was lying flat on the mattress.</p> <p>"Take me now," she said, as her legs raised off the floor and he was able to enter her in the missionary position.</p> <p>She reached her hand out and put it on his throbbing dick, as he began to move within her. She wrapped her fingers around his shaft, pulling him into her as he began to push himself back into her. They fucked like that for quite a while, both feeling the familiar stirring building within themselves. Finally, she felt him stiffening, his body tensing as he shot his last load into her. They both moaned in unison as they came together - his first time fucking each other after they had fucked each other senseless over twenty-five years. It was so overwhelming to her.</p> <p>They lay there for a moment, feeling the heat of their bodies slowly melt together, his dick slowly deflating within her as they cuddled and kissed again. He spoke first, "I love you."</p> <p>She felt a tingle in her pussy, "I love you too," she replied. They lay there in their bed, with her holding his hand and his hand in hers, for what felt like an eternity. She closed her eyes and basked in the feeling of both their bodies on top of hers. She loved the feel of his cum shooting into her - it felt so hot and sticky. Their juices smeared across her body as they lay in each others arms. She could taste her own juices on him - an indescribable taste which she loved. They both got their breaths back and looked at each other, thinking about what had just happened.</p> <p>Finally, they got up from the bed and got ready to go, but neither of them really knew how to go about it anymore. They would have to call it off, but neither of them wanted her to call it off. She knew some other time she wanted to do it again, but it would have to be right before that, would it not.</p> <p>"We haven't done it yet," she said as they headed out to the car. They both knew she didn't want to do it just yet, and they didn't want to start without them. They were really enjoying the moment they had experienced and it was so thrilling to them both.</p> <p>They drove into her driveway and David turned off the car. "Come here," he said. He held her in his arms and gave her a long, tender kiss and whispered, "I'll let you decide if you want me to go with you."</p> <p>"We can't," she protested, looking at his eyes, "and I don't want to force anything on you eitherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
