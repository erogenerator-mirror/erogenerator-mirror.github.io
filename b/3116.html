I was beginning to wonder if he really was seeing me but the discussion had been light and casual as far as he could remember. I was beginning to love the attention but what about when he came home? What if he had a boyfriend or if he was going to stay faithful? I knew that I really had no chance. I would never feel the way I did about my son being unable to have sex, to make love if he wasn't around. No, if he didn't want it, well hell I wouldn't even sleep with him, I would just have to tell him that I loved him and we had to move on. But what if the night wasn't really over? Maybe we could even forget it ever happened.</p> <p>Then I had the idea that maybe he never really did cheat on me. He would never have to tell his dad about the night he told my dad. It could ruin his chance to ever see me. Would that be a real shock? Or was I just acting like my mind just couldn't quite grasp all that his story was about?</p> <p>I had no idea what to say. We had just spoken with him and it had seemed to us right.</p> <p>"John, when you look at me and see how hard I think I am, it'll do you no good to say anything back to me."</p> <p>We were both silent for a while, then he took my hand, placed it on his thigh and pressed it closer to his swollen sex.</p> <p>"This is going to be tough."</p> <p>"Yes, I admit it and I won't let anything happen again."</p> <p>He reached around grabbed ahold of my arm and pulled me back to him. He looked me straight in the eyes, then whispered in my ear, "No one's ever told me that I just had to fuck you. I can't fuck anybody but you, but whenever you want it, it's yours."</p> <p>He held my face and stared deep into my eyes, there was something in his eyes that looked almost scary. I wanted to punch him across the face but I also knew that I had nothing to fear. I just wanted to be held like this, so I didn't look back up into the eyes of the man who had made that promise so many times in the past. We kissed passionately, our bodies rubbed against one another in a sensuous yet erotic ballet.</p> <p>When his lips touched mine I was surprised, it's always been something she likes, even our little peck. This kiss was not at all sexual but as passionate as it was I found myself getting aroused just by the way his lips felt on mine. He kissed me back, moving his tongue between my lips, I parted them and slipped it in, feeling his hardness. I had to concentrate on not getting another erection. It had been a long time since I had had sex but I wanted this so desperately, I could barely breathe. He broke the kiss, and pulled me back to him, we kissed as passionately as the last time, then he reached around me and put my hand on his cock.</p> <p>I wanted his hand on me, on my breasts, my pussy, in my mouth.</p> <p>"No, you can't," I said weakly, "I'm not getting my hopes up too high."</p> <p>He had no intention of going back to the room before I got his idea, I had always heard it was a good idea to stop for oral sex, which is why it hadn't happened much in the past. Then he brought my hand up to my mouth to lick our juices off.</p> <p>"You taste nice. Why don't you have your lover over here."</p> <p>He took a step back from me and I thought that, if I didn't know better, I might have thought he just wanted to take his clothes off. He walked over to me, and I followed, I thought I had a chance to be with him but he was already undressing me. I couldn't believe this, my son was taking his time and it was as if he just wanted to see my naked body and wanted me to have an orgasm with him only.</p> <p>He unbuttoned the front of my blouse and pulled it off over my head, then threw it on the ground. I was glad he hadn't gone any closer, I was going to be naked under that blouse anyway.</p> <p>He pulled my shorts off but didn't take them off yet. I kicked off my shoes and he helped me, removing my socks and panties before I could get them off. In no time he had them off and was lying back on the sofa, pulling me into his arms. He kissed me deeply, tasting the musky flavor of our sex on my lips. He lifted me up ontoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
