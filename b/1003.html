Sorry about leaving you."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to leave you. I was enjoying myself and did what I needed to see." I could be wrong, but there's no way she's gonna leave this room with the kind of attitude I'm putting out here. I hope I didn't seem too pushy for putting things out here.</p> <p>"That's okay. I was just happy that we were friends. I figured if I had the opportunity to do that then I could do that to you for all that we were like, family."</p> <p>"We're family."</p> <p>"I'm so happy to hear that and you, I don't mind."</p> <p>We both laughed and had a couple of more drinks and got a table next to the window. We talked about a lot of the things we'd been doing. I felt happy for her and that I wouldn't have any regrets if she had done that. And then I remembered that she liked sex. I guess I shouldn't have expected that, but it's the only thing on her mind. She does and she's just making up. And then I'm thinking, "This is for fun that's all. I've got nothing to worry about because it's her. I like the sex." She just doesn't feel at all like she's cheating on me or anything. It's just...different. She wants sex a lot, even if it's just for her job or family. That makes it more exciting. And a guy's usually in that position with the woman, but that's just her way of enjoying it. This is definitely new. That and she has needs that men aren't looking to fill. Her sex life was getting much better. She's been doing fine. She just has to be careful, you know?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I know. It doesn't seem like she's cheating on me and not having any good sex or something."</p> <p>"That's right. Well, she's probably sleeping around and I've never heard such a nasty expression in my life." She looked up at me. "You mean this is because she's got it in her head? I wouldn't be too harsh if I were you."</p> <p>We started a conversation, and after talking a bit I asked if she wanted to go back to her room. We went to the bar and she took off her coat and hung it up. She got up and we walked over to the window. We looked at the lights and then at each other. I got an idea and started walking over to her.</p> <p>"So, do you have some condoms?"</p> <p>"Only if you get me something more."</p> <p>"Okay, we can use your bed if you want."</p> <p>"No, I want you. If it's too uncomfortable I just want to have sex with you."</p> <p>"Well, you're my lover and I really like that."</p> <p>After a little discussion we decided to leave and go have a drink somewhere we could go. I asked her if she wanted to see her room again, but she said it was too crowded in this bar for both of us.</p> <p>She took the two extra condoms from her purse on the bar and had me put them in my pocket. She came right over to my car and as I started to open her door she stopped me.</p> <p>"I'm not feeling very comfortable, are you?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Well, just go back to your room and I'll see you tomorrow night." The way she said it made me feel really good that she was going to take me back to her room with the promise that she had other things in mind.</p> <p>I did.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Chapter Six: What happens when we get back to our room.</p> <p>When I came back out to the bar in the hotel, I saw her sitting comfortably in the bar. I also got that great view through the bar of her body that I know would make some older ladies swoon. And then she saw me and smiled. I don't think my eyes could have even connected with those tits. We had an hour to spare before our drive home to our bedroom.</p> <p>"Did you see that?" She asked as we approached our door.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's me." I opened the door and let her in. We walked to the bed room and she dropped her overnight bag in the middle of the room. When she leaned up against the door I looked in and saw her eyes on me. She was grinning and she reached up and gave me a kiss. I pulled back and she said, "What's next then?"</p> <p>"Well," I told her, "I guess you could leave itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
