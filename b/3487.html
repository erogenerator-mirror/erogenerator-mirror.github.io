I felt her hand on my shoulder as she squeezed and pulled, sending a chill of fear and longing into my veins, and I knew my cock had grown harder than the rest of me. I could feel her cunt spasms around me. The softness of her body against me was amazing.</p> <p>"You should go ahead now, sweetie, come on." I said as I slid my cock slowly out until just my head was inside her. I kept moving myself in and out of her, the warm friction of her pussy being held against me making me feel more and more like Mr. Smith.</p> <p>"It's yours," she said, her voice breathless. "Let me take care of you now," she said, leaning close to my ear. "I am yours to do with as you please."</p> <p>I couldn't resist as she moved her thighs gently up and down. Her body was warm. Her tits pressed against my chest. I wanted to kiss her. I wanted to hold her, suck her tits, rub them until we both came together.</p> <p>"I know we haven't had much to drink, honey, but you should come home with me tonight. I want you to really satisfy me, please." She said.</p> <p>"You want me to fuck you? Well, I don't know. Do you?" I replied.</p> <p>"God, yes! Please!" She responded, her voice quavering with excitement. "I want you to fuck me! I want you to fuck me!"</p> <p>"OK, then. Now," I said. Now the mood was really changing, and I was eager to let her have her own way.</p> <p>I eased myself into her with a slow firm stroke, reveling in the feel of her warmth and her firmness. The feeling of her tightness around me and my shaft was different from any woman I had ever been with before. The sensation of the soft silken friction of her pussy and the heat of her body was really amazing.</p> <p>Then I had the idea, as in the past, that we could let some of this heat run down me so we could fuck. I lifted myself up off her arms and began to move my cock in and out of her. It felt good. It felt as if I was fucking that warm moistness between my thighs, and I knew I was going to do that all night long. I could feel my cock sliding in and out of her with ease as I moved to and fro in her.</p> <p>In and out, in and out, I moved. Her whole body moved with me. She was so beautiful being laid back on my bed, naked and with my cock pistoning in and out of her. She moaned my name in my ear as my weight hung against her, but we both knew it was far from that. I knew my pace very well, and she smiled into my shoulder as she did.</p> <p>Her body was still as beautiful as it was moments before, the way she was moving back and forth, the way the muscles of her belly moved with mine. The softness of her curves, the softness of her cunt. Her fingers moved along the length of my torso to my side where she grasped my ass cheeks and pulled me in. My hands moved along her body to her tits. I rolled her nipples between my fingers then rubbed my thumb over her little clit. She gasped in my ear.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she breathed. Her body shook in my hands. So did I. I felt my cock swell, the heat of her pussy around it, and I let go a sudden flood of cum inside her.</p> <p>"Oh, god!" She whispered as an intense wave of warmth hit me. "I'm coming!" I heard her say. She started to move on me again. The waves of her orgasm washed over me in strong wave after wave. They seemed to last forever, I could feel it flowing down me and into her.</p> <p>Her body jerked against mine when she climaxed, and my softening cock felt as if it was about to burst open at any moment. She squeezed me tightly with her thighs to try to keep our bodies warm. We held onto each other tightly as she shook underneath my touch, and her pussy slowly faded out of its grip. We lay there a while, still locked together for another few moments, and I looked at her face as she came back to me.</p> <p>Her eyes were half closed when she raised her hair from her face.</p> <p>"My god, did you feel that?" She smiled as she spoke.</p> <p>"You made me cum." I said, squeezing her gently.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, still smiling. "I don't think I've ever felt like that before."</p> <p>"You're welcome."
