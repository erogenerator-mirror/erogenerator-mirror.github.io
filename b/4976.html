Well, I know some of the older kids are out there with their own 'mommies', so don't let my dad down. They love our company, so we aren't going anywhere."</p> <p>"Dad. I know you want to tell me, all those other details like that," she laughed.</p> <p>"Well it's all going to work out. I'll keep my promise," he promised, kissing her forehead.</p> <p>"Ok, but we'll see, honey. We'll see," she said, rubbing her hand on the top of his head. "You see, I'm not even going to try and force an old lover. And I don't even know you're old enough to be my father. It's like I'm going to give you the chance you need in order to make sure this is the right one," he said, giving her a friendly smile. "I might even put you on the spot for an exclusive fuck you don't like a lot," he said, with a shrug of his shoulders.</p> <p>"Honey, that's just how it is. No sex," she scoffed. "I've told you before you don't trust me. I do love you."</p> <p>"What about me, huh? Your father, if I get fucked by somebody, you want me to watch?"</p> <p>"No. Of course not," she protested. "Now go," she smiled, picking up her clothes and her bag.</p> <p>"I'll call you later okay? And I promise, you will feel better," he said, giving her a loving grin.</p> <p>"Whatever you say," she returned, heading upstairs to her room.</p> <p>Chapter 8.</p> <p>"Honey," Chris said, kissing him. "I'm going to stay with mommy for a little while. We don't want them going all the time," he said with a chuckle.</p> <p>"Mommmm, that's sweet of you to say," she said, hugging him back. "But I sure hope that your father will give me a special treat for my birthday," she said with a sweet grin.</p> <p>"Mommm?" Chris asked, looking at her curiously. "Is mommy ok with me fucking her too?"</p> <p>"Yeah, mommy's ok. I've made her cum a few times, just not like her daddy does. And I'll tell you the same thing from now on. It might have been our favorite birthday gift for all of us!" she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Mommmy is a sex maniac, and I love her for it," he told her, grinning. "And you are something else. Beautiful, sexy, talented, and beautiful," he said, looking at her with his best boyish grin.</p> <p>"No baby," she cooed in his ear, wrapping his hands around her waist and drawing them down to her thighs, where they slowly disappeared under her skirt. She gave him a playful slap, but didn't stop him there. "That's for wearing the outfit," he replied.</p> <p>"And what outfit?" she asked, tickling his sides.</p> <p>"This way," he replied, grabbing her top and pulling it up to her neck. "It has the most beautiful effect that a boy can have on his mother's sexy body," he said with a chuckle.</p> <p>"I can see now," she said, laughing. "That would be quite provocative to me," she said, letting her eyes scan over his body. "But I think that's the deal, baby."</p> <p>"Mommmm yeah," he replied, taking her arm. "I think I can see it in her. It's pretty, and sexy as well," he said, giving her a soft smile.</p> <p>"Ok. But you can go in the other bed. It's clean, and we won't bother you tomorrow," she winked at him.</p> <p>"I'll try to be good this time," he grinned, grabbing her hand and pulling her after him.</p> <p>"Mommmm," she sighed, pulling away from him and turning around facing the stairs. "Don't you dare put your hands on my bum again. It's a little too sensitive right now," she chuckled, pulling him to her at the bottom of the stairs. She leaned back against him, holding his hands over her breasts. "Besides, there are more than enough people downstairs to see everything. And I'm in the mood for some teasing," she told him with a grin.</p> <p>"Hmmph," Chris mumbled, rolling his eyes.</p> <p>"Do you know where to put your stuff when we get there?" she asked with a mischievous grin.
