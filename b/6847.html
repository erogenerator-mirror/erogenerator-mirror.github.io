So, just keep dreaming and have fun," I grinned.</p> <p>My phone buzzed then and I smiled at the little miss I knew that would soon have me back to school. My sister had sent all the text messages and the last one had her number and it was me. We made the two mile trip home in record time then.</p> <p>We arrived the next morning at home. I had gotten the van and the food up and moving. In just a few minutes we were on the road.</p> <p>It was a beautiful, early Spring morning. The sun came through her windows and my mind and my mind seemed to float back, to that first time we made love. The memory would never fade as long as I stayed awake. It could be difficult being there that way. Mom's words and her thoughts seemed to take root in all my thoughts. I kept recalling moments of the moment.</p> <p>The house was warm and inviting and I knew it was where I wanted to be. My sister and I were both already sleeping peacefully and the last thing I wanted to do was wake her up the night before graduation.</p> <p>Mom took charge and I was given a light, quick shower before heading to the kitchen for breakfast.</p> <p>We had the day to ourselves. Mom had been helping me in the kitchen and getting everything ready. On the table were our dinner. As the evening wore on and the girls got dressed, we continued to watch a movie. I was watching the last reel of Harry Potter when the doorbell rang. Dad answered the door and we both looked through the peephole to see who it was.</p> <p>Mom was at the door with a large bouquet of pink roses. She looked gorgeous. She opened the door and we greeted each other in a warm embrace.</p> <p>I asked, "Hey, honey."</p> <p>"Hi, Daddy," she replied, and she lifted the flowers from her hand and laid them in my lap. "You're making this wonderful evening. I love you. Let's go to bed," she said and took a huge breath of air before I could even respond, "No, please," she added with a smile.</p> <p>"No, I'm in the car," I told her.</p> <p>With that, my sister took my hand and she lifted it to her mouth and kissed it, "And I'm not just going to give you the goodnight kiss. I'm going to give you something you're going to really like."</p> <p>I could only shake my head in disbelief at her words. I felt the blush rise in my face. "So this is something that I can do with no repercussions?" I asked her.</p> <p>She smiled as her arm went around my neck and brought us together. "It will be absolutely beautiful and really, really special." And with that she kissed me again.</p> <p>"So, Daddy," she asked, "Do you mind if we do this thing again?"</p> <p>"Oh, absolutely not, sweetheart. You want your first time to be special and you want to do it together."</p> <p>"I don't know why, Daddy," she replied. "I don't think we should talk any more right now. I'm so tired from talking." She kissed me again and held me close, "This kiss was so sweet and romantic and I haven't done anything like it ever since high school when we were little."</p> <p>I tried to comfort her. "You never stopped, sweetheart."</p> <p>She gave me a brief hug and I thought she would leave me when she closed the door. I didn't hear any protest as she turned her back and reached over and pressed her softness against me. My hands were everywhere at once. My tongue pushed into her mouth and I felt the muscles of her tongue respond. I let my hands trace the outlines of her back. I couldn't get enough of her. I pulled her in my arms and felt her bare skin and her breasts press against me.</p> <p>I broke from the embrace reluctantly, "Let's take a shower and go have a lovely evening."</p> <p>"Okay, Daddy," she agreed and with a grin she led me back to the bedroom. When we entered the bathroom, we faced the mirror and I looked at her standing there. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I felt as if my heart would explode and I knew I would never be able to hold the feeling in my heart. I was like an idiotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
