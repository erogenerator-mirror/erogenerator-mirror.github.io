And I need to get out of this town in the middle of it all. But I also want to tell everyone that I am going to be coming to town. So I was surprised when I received a call about a week ago from a friend of mine. He and I met up a few weeks ago and then were talking for the first time in over a month. He told me that he needed a few things done in town and that he wanted to come up with some stuff for me to do. Which it made me nervous. As before, I agreed but with his last comment that I was ready for anything now. And this time. It might be a little too soon.</p> <p>As we waited for the other shoe to drop on our respective paths I got all these hard feelings going. I was about to make the decision to come back to him when a part of me said I couldn't just walk away from him. So I said this was too quick and not a good idea. The other part of me was screaming that I shouldn't make a life of it without doing things for him.</p> <p>But, that was too fast for me to stop. As I stared into his eyes and I saw them start to change, too. His eyes had become even darker. His body had lost that beautiful hardness it had been hiding since I first met him. As his breathing became heavier, I could tell he was getting harder.</p> <p>The moment of truth was coming when we both broke the silence and I told him to get out of my car. I didn't want to leave him on the side of the road but he wanted to know that I meant what I had said to him.</p> <p>"Okay, here we go." I said, trying to change the mood.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I'm just sorry that I didn't get you to do something for me."</p> <p>"It's okay. I still get lonely and this last week has been crazy. Even if I did get to do a lot of things for you I never should have done. I think I would have gone out a lot more if you actually asked."</p> <p>"Oh. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Why would that be for you? You're not even here to make me feel things I don't deserve."</p> <p>"Oh! It's okay, I get that."</p> <p>"It is. So, are you ready?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yeah. Let's go."</p> <p>"Do I get a say in this one?"</p> <p>"Oh God yes, I got it!" I said.</p> <p>So, I let my friend drive me back to the parking lot. I thought that by the time we got to the car it would be over. But, it wasn't. It only took a short drive for me to realize that he wouldn't be going back to meet me. At first, I almost felt bad for him.</p> <p>As we stopped at a rest stop I really started to regret agreeing to go for that once we got back. I wanted to forget this whole thing. I wasn't into him for the sex, but I certainly was in a position to feel like everything that happened could be forgiven over the next few weeks. But, I had promised myself that my friendship would never change. We had not even exchanged names when we had walked down that street to meet. All that came back was what we had agreed in the beginning - and it didn't have to happen again.</p> <p>We drove on for about a couple of miles before I saw that sign for the road in the parking lot ahead. When I got there I parked the car and walked over to the building. I didn't really understand what was going on here. There wasn't any sign where we parked and there wasn't any other sign. Maybe he had not wanted to leave the car there.</p> <p>The place was deserted. You could hear a pin drop in the distance. I was about to turn around and head back to my car when I heard a knock on the door. I walked to the front foyer and opened the door to see who had come through the door. I was surprised! This looked much worse than the guy I had been in the parking lot with last night. He was in a uniform shirt and that had a collar that read "Nortons & Hiring." My eyes dropped down to his crotch. It was definitely all there. It's not small, just enough that you could feel something. I watched in amazement as he pulled up his pants and zipped up his fly. He pulled the zipper down a couple of inches and got out of his clothes. I didn't know if this was real. I had never heard anything about this before.</p> <p>That first thing I saw before my eyes was himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
