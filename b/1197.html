There is a place out there where you can come and get what is on offer." he said. "It's in a hotel." he added.</p> <p>"I have a room there." I pointed, as we stepped into the elevator. "How about you?" he asked. He was already holding my hand and kissing me on my cheek and neck, but after a pause I realized I really should be doing this. I didn't feel any need to say anything either. We exited the elevator and into the room, which was neat and tidy and set back a bit off the living room wall, with a small couch in front of a fire. A small fridge and small wine glasses, along with two cases of beer, sat on the coffee table right in front of the fire. He set the wine glasses aside, and gestured me to take of the jacket first. I didn't hesitate. The jacket quickly clung in place by pulling up almost to my waist. He looked at my breasts. They were smaller than either of mine or my tits could have been. The black lace bra, although definitely not a sports bra, kept my nipples from showing through.</p> <p>"I don't know. They are just fine." I said. He laughed and picked my top up and put it on. My top. It was a black, low cut v-neck with two small straps that came across my shoulders, and came down just below my breasts. The top was just like the panties I had worn all night, and they were tight. I felt really sexy. "I don't know either. I'm wearing the same ones I wore last time." he smiled as he checked me out. "You have great legs," he added.</p> <p>"Thank you sir." I smiled.</p> <p>"You feel really feminine in them aren't you?" he asked as he started unbuttoning my blouse. I closed my eyes and leaned back against the coffee table. I knew how to use my hands, and this felt even better. I didn't say anything, but just opened my eyes to look at him. I felt his hands on my breasts. I could barely focus when his fingers started tracing a nipple. "That is nice." I whispered. "Let's take that off." I reached behind him and undid the clasp for his belt and button. I unzipped his pants and started gently rubbing his hardening dick through the shorts.</p> <p>I felt his cock hardening in my hands. "Oh yes," I murmured. "Do you mind if I take off your pants?" He nodded as I stepped out of his slacks. I unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off. I held his dick in my hand as I kissed him the way he was kissing me. I felt his chest next to my body, which felt great, and his stomach next to my breasts. It felt so masculine, so big, and so manly as I ran my hand lightly up his back. The skin, and the weight of it was soft and smooth. I ran my finger over his chest, as he opened his eyes. I could see his eyes staring up at mine. My finger found the tip of his dick, which began to twitches with his own growing erection.</p> <p>I slipped off his shoes and socks, pulling my shirt back over my breasts, and stood up. He was still staring at me, as I stepped forward to unbutton his pants. I stepped out of them, and stepped back to remove mine, but still kept his eyes on me.</p> <p>"I never realized." he said, his hands dropping to my hips. "This is what I mean." he said. I felt his hands lift my skirt, and then to the sides of his briefs, and lower them to let them fall away. I stood in front of him in just my panties, still not taking my eyes off of him. He started pulling me to him. I put my arms around his neck, and he put his hands on my ass. He put his lips on my ear as he continued to kiss me. "I have never met a man who's not a kisser..." his voice trailed off. All that I could do was nod.</p> <p>He pushed me back a bit. My hands went up to his shirt, and he shrugged as he pulled the shirt apart. I pulled it off over his head. I reached forward to undo his shorts. My hands reached his dick. I grabbed it again, and pulled him towards me, and he lifted himself up on to the couch and helped me to my knees on the floor.</p> <p>I looked at his large, hairy chest with thick, curly brown hair, and the tip of his cock, pointing towards my mouth. "Oh my", I whispered as I looked at his huge dick. His body was slender, as I knew from the workout I had performedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
