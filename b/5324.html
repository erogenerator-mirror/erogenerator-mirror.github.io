You should try to come visit it, and maybe do some of the things you'd like to do."</p> <p>"I like to think that's the point," he grinned.</p> <p>"You know," Karen said with a shrug, "I think I'm in love with you."</p> <p>A quick flash of her face as her eyes widened, surprised she was being so frank; a brief flash of her smiling.</p> <p>"You wouldn't, what, love me too," he replied. "I'm more of a romantic man, like I said."</p> <p>She put her hands over her face and looked at him a little longer, then shook her head. She had her finger in her mouth. She hadn't been that surprised about liking to spend time with him, but hadn't really expected it too. She was aware that his eyes had adjusted and she felt a bit of the butterflies in her stomach in spite of their being near the end.</p> <p>"You're not a romantic?" he asked, raising and eyebrow.</p> <p>She grinned. "Maybe not. What was it like? What would you do?"</p> <p>"I've been thinking about it a lot, the last time I visited you. I found it to be a little scary. I wanted it to do nothing with you being there, in real life, but I didn't know how you'd handle it. How you'd say things to me about my mother, all I ever got was a bad, cold-ass smile, and it was hard to see it with your father."</p> <p>"He'd be surprised to know I'd said stuff like that," she said, "and to be even more surprised when I told him why I liked it and what I liked. I can't even imagine how you'd react if I said that I thought it was weird to have such feelings for you."</p> <p>She could see his mouth go a bit dry and she knew he felt the same.</p> <p>"I do love you," he said, "and I really did love you, and my feelings for you have never flagged. I don't know how it is that I have feelings for you and it's not just me feeling guilty, maybe because I love you."</p> <p>She shook her head, then glanced at him again, smiled slightly.</p> <p>"But, I don't really. It never really does. I wouldn't feel guilty because I'm not really a lesbian."</p> <p>"I'm not," he murmured. "I do love you; maybe more than I thought I would in the same way."</p> <p>She sighed. Then she looked at him a moment longer.</p> <p>"I just think... that I still can't say the wrong thing with you. Maybe that's what I've always felt, but it's been hard on me even now... to think that you had any type of relationship with other person and that I still felt the same way about you."</p> <p>He nodded, then looked at her and said, "I always suspected that when we first got together that I might be thinking about you, and I don't think I should say anything that just makes things that much worse."</p> <p>She shook her head again at his non-answer and it had more of a sad, lonely appeal to her, even though it seemed she'd just left it at that.</p> <p>"This might sound really weird, or maybe it's not," she said, trying to sound as nonchalant as she could. "But it's not that strange. I just think I'm a lesbian."</p> <p>"Me too," Dan agreed, "and it's definitely not weird, but, no, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just saying I'm not. I've done... things I never thought I would. I never wanted a relationship with anyone else, I never wanted to be that way when we got together."</p> <p>She nodded. She'd been aware of Dan's affection for her too, probably more than he expected, but she'd never thought to think of him that way, and really had wondered what happened when they got together that way.</p> <p>"And I didn't want to hurt anyone," she continued, "and I didn't blame myself for it either. I'm glad I didn't break you off, you're a good guy. I'm only glad you're single."</p> <p>She glanced at him again and saw his arms going a bit lower, her own arms seemed to go a bit lower... and she felt her cheeks heat up a little more in that moment. And her eyes flicked down to his shorts once more.</p> <p>"I just wasn't sure," she said finally. "I'm just happy that you're coming here to help celebrate your holiday. I know it was a bit abrupt, but, I just wanted to say thanks for inviting me to your cabin for the last time. It was such a wonderful thingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
