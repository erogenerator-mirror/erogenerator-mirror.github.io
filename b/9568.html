I decided not to ask, but just let him take control of the situation.</p> <p>"Do you think that's okay?" I asked, my voice a little quiver of nervousness.</p> <p>He did take a step back, keeping his eyes locked with mine, "Absolutely," he answered, "if you're not wearing one I'm afraid of what will happen."</p> <p>"That's a relief," I said with a start, "it's really kind of sexy how things are changing between us."</p> <p>He gave me a little shove away from him and grabbed his dick. It only took him a second or two longer than that because he had been holding his breath for close to 30 seconds. It occurred to me then that his dick might have been at least a foot long and maybe more. He might have been going to cum by then, it just didn't make sense.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I won't last long. But don't let that worry you, okay?"</p> <p>"You got it, boss."</p> <p>Well this was going to be a big mistake. I looked at him, my heart in my mouth, "Okay."</p> <p>I started to put my panties on, as I thought I'd done many times before with the same results. He quickly pulled them off and tossed them over his shoulder. Then he pulled my panties off the rest of the way and then started to put them on too. He did his job well, getting them the middle of the leg, making sure to slide them over my pussy lips a few times before he had them over. His body was aching.</p> <p>"You're going to get it at some point during the ride. Now let's change the subject, okay?" I looked back at him as he started to put the underwear on and then I could see the bulge in his pants growing. "I thought maybe we could put on some music and go dancing if you want, Mr. Johnson."</p> <p>"Actually I just want to see you," he whispered as he walked to the kitchen to start the music. I looked behind me at the clock on the counter and then me as I pulled down the little zipper on the back of my dress, and then I pulled the dress down my shoulders, and off my legs. After a few seconds of watching him, I unzipped it again and looked back at him.</p> <p>"Oh," he said a little nervously, "I don't know what you want to do, Mr. Johnson."</p> <p>I took the dress off over my head and slipped the shoulder straps off my shoulders. His eyes went wide a bit, and for a minute he did not look at me when I turned around. I was starting to feel dizzy. I quickly pulled the dress back over my head, feeling the air around my naked body.</p> <p>"No really," I said, "I'd like to do a bit of dancing. You're very good."</p> <p>The look of surprise on his face said it all. He was almost out of his seat when he looked me over, his eyes still locked with mine. I took a step nearer and stepped closer to him, putting my head right in front of his face. He was still sitting, his legs were spread, and his cock was still only a sliver away from coming out. I was starting to breathe much too quickly.</p> <p>"You want to dance, right?" I asked, my eyes never leaving his; his eyes opened to meet mine, his nostrils taking on a sexy smell.</p> <p>After a moment he nodded, his head tilting forward. "Uh-huh," he said, taking a step closer. I felt a rush of adrenaline rush through me as my first step seemed to push the fear to the back of my mind as much as it did the fear of who was going to see.</p> <p>"It's okay when he touches you, Mr. Johnson," I said, "It's only fair he did that for you when he can do anything else he wants to you and he will too."</p> <p>I moved closer until my breasts were now only inches away from his face and my pussy was brushing his belt. I put my arms around his neck, running my hands over his shoulders and my fingers around his ears. My eyes locked on his, as he started to feel an almost automatic response to what I was saying.</p> <p>"Can heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
