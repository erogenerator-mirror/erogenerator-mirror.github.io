I smiled and took control. “It feels so hard for me to hold you back."</p> <p>“I wanted to hold you, “ I said and pressed my lips to hers and we kissed. Our lips parted as we turned as we walked out the bedroom. I laid her down on the bed and started to remove her clothes. Her legs were parted as I moved towards her and she reached to stroke as I kissed my way down her body. I stopped and kissed her nipples as I reached her mound.</p> <p>“Don’t, “ she told me, “You’re all I want at that moment." I moved to nibble and suck at her mound while she moaned “Yes, oh that feels so good." Her hand had reached down to touch my face to her pubic hair.</p> <p>I turned her over on her stomach and kissed me way down her back. As I kissed her soft hairline I moved to run my fingers in past her lips and up her thighs. I wanted to touch her like the men did when she was hot, but instead I kissed my way back up her body and stopped to kiss her ear. I traced her jawline with kisses and she sighed.</p> <p>“I want to taste you.” She arched her neck and ran her hands through me and then ran back up over my chest. I continued kissing and gently squeezing until she pulled me down to her. I held my fingers to her lips as my tongue slid in between them. She let a breath escape through me as I slid my tongue in and out of her mouth. She groaned and pressed her hips more to meet me.</p> <p>I wanted it so badly. I knew she wanted me too. So I moved up her body kissing my way to her ear while my fingers moved to her clit. Her hands moved to hold me as her hips moved against my hand and fingers. She was ready for me, more than ever before.</p> <p>I moved lower with my hands and kissed her stomach as my tongue started to circle her stomach, moving lower. When my tongue reached her navel, she groaned louder and I took it into my mouth. I pulled my mouth away from her and ran my tongue along her rib cage. Her back arched and she let a breathy groan. I kissed my way down to her navel again and licked around it while her hips moved up and down. Her breathing was ragged and she pushed her hips into my face. I slid my tongue down to her opening then came back up to kiss her. She kissed me back but made no move to move. Her hands held my head close as she pulled me against her.</p> <p>“God you taste so good,” she moaned and pushed my head down. When I licked up to her clit, she pushed my head further into her until my tongue touched her with a wave, “Oh, I’m cumming. I’m cccuuummmminnniiiiinnnnnnnnnnnggggg…” Her voice trailed off into moans. I lifted my head and kissed her gently on the lips, then kissed her nipples again, licking each nipple, kissing and sucking with my tongue.</p> <p>Her back arched and her eyes closed as she reached down to grab my head. I wanted to taste her, wanted to drink her, but didn’t. In her excitement she pulled me up to kiss me as her body squirmed against mine.</p> <p>“Oh, I want you so," she let out an excited squeal. I pulled her body to mine. I kissed her neck, then up her chest to her mouth. We kissed as I held her on top of me while she moved her knees around me so she could hold on to me, her hands caressed the inside of my thighs.</p> <p>I broke our lip lock after a few moments. I reached down to pull up on her waist to pull her down on me. She let out a groan when I slid my hands around to her breast, one hand on the outside of my thigh, the other on the inside. My legs became slick as I kissed the inside of her thighs, then began to kiss up. My hands left her breasts to wander around to her ass. Her hands grabbed my ass and we rocked together, our bodies moving faster against each other.</p> <p>I cupped her ass with one hand and pulled her body in to mine. Our breasts rubbed, our lips pressed together as our hips moved against each other. My fingers found her clit and I teased it while we kissed. The other hand slipped inside her shorts and caressed her mound. Her fingers caressed the outside of my—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
