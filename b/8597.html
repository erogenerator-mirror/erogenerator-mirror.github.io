I couldn't have been happier; I never could have.</p> <p>"Now that we're officially, officially 'married', there's a big break in the 'we", as they say. With the news of my first week with a guy, I got to live with the first person in my life.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>Now I have been known to get pretty excited about something, whether it's a movie, a girl/guy meeting, me picking out a new toy, or a friend catching a train on Christmas morning, when a certain man came into my life.</p> <p>The last thing to do is start thinking 'I'm sure he won't be around forever'. I don't have a heart as I always thought about how I could go on, but that's how I feel in a situation like this.</p> <p>"Oh, god," I thought, "I'm falling hopelessly in love."</p> <p>I also thought of a million other things as well.</p> <p>I have no desire to be anything but happily married to the man. I'm not quite as lucky as it may seem, with a man who I'm dating, yet every fantasy that is on my mind is one that I'm having when we are alone, that we might be out for dinner and then out, going to the movies, or going to the bar to meet up, or the beach, and then out.</p> <p>I have a feeling about things that I don't have the common sense to put this down to and the fact that no woman has ever said that to me in all the months I've gone before.</p> <p>I know it is a weird feeling because it's one that goes with any relationship and I guess I've always felt that way with most relationships, and even when it is with someone who doesn't seem to mind that they are married to someone who is married.</p> <p>Maybe it's because I've never been with anyone outside my marriage and that's pretty good too.</p> <p>Maybe it's because we can't always be together.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>*Dinner is set to take place on July 14, 2012 at the Pacific Pacific Ocean Hotel located on the Pacific Coast Highway just north of the airport in Northern California.</p> <p>* * * * * * *</p> <p>*As with any of the events of the last couple of years, this week's highlights from the start, is the opening and then followed by the main event.</p> <p>*The meeting of the three of us should take place in the Hotel's private dining room on the top floor.</p> <p>*The room will serve a purpose to you for a few moments.</p> <p>*You may take a seat.</p> <p>*You may put your dinner in the kitchen.</p> <p>*You may undress down to your t-shirt.</p> <p>*You may put your shoes on the bed.</p> <p>*You may put your socks on the floor too.</p> <p>*You may put your clothing in the shower and then the bedroom.</p> <p>*You may undress as you do as the meeting of the three of us ends.</p> <p>*Once you are naked, you can put your coat on.</p> <p>*You may do that as you do all this before sitting on the bed and finishing your dinner.</p> <p>*You may lay on the bed waiting.</p> <p>*Then for the next fifteen minutes you will read the stories from your book.</p> <p>*As your submission ends, there will likely be an email on your answering machine.</p> <p>There will still be no sexual contact, nor will there be any photos of this meeting as discussed beforehand.</p> <p>There will be no sexually explicit stories about any of the four of us.</p> <p>There won't be any of us dressed like it, wearing any of our clothes, having sex in some part of the room that we are not comfortable in.</p> <p>If we are asked to put on our jackets, we might want to.</p> <p>There will be no sex or kissing during the meetings.</p> <p>*A brief synopsis on the date and time for the meeting.</p> <p>*This meeting will include, but not be at the hotel.</p> <p>*After the meeting ends, we will go out to dinner and then the evening afterwards.</p> <p>*When we get back to the hotel and eat dinner, we will take a hotel elevator to the fifth floor and continue on down the hallway.</p> <p>*We will then go to the bed and then go to the next room.</p> <p>*When we get back down the hallway to the next level, we will go to the room next door and unbutton your jacket and put it on.
