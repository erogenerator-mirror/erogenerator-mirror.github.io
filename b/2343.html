I sat there, staring at a piece of paper on the floor, a scrap of my clothes. I didn't know what I was looking at. What had they given to him to wear? He had to be naked. Not just my clothes, but the rest of my things too. He'd have to be naked too. That's why I had no shirt on. I was wearing some kind of bra with just a bra strap on. It made me feel stupid. I didn't even really think about that.</p> <p>My heart thumped and trembled in my throat. He saw me looking, and was looking at me.</p> <p>I kept staring at the scrap of paper on the floor. "What in the world are you doing," I thought. I was shaking. I felt my legs tremble. And my heart almost stopped. I turned around and was confronted with the most beautiful boy I'd ever seen naked. He had a broad smile on his face. He was tall and his thick, blond hair fell neatly down his chest. I had to admit he was very well built. His eyes looked up at me. They widened as I stared back at him. His lips were parted, and he was staring at me. I suddenly felt faint. He leaned in and kissed me. I jumped and turned to get away from him.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I want to go through with it. I've never done it before," I muttered. I looked at my lap. There was a small wet spot on my skirt. Was he excited I thought. He smiled. There was a wet patch on his shirt too. I thought back to the letter. Why hadn't he just asked for a shirt? I reached over and picked up the letter. It looked like a letter from him. I read the first lines.</p> <p>"My boyfriends all said, "I'm going to get some nice presents." I think it was an envelope. He wrote something down on the letter. "You never saw it before." He wrote something else. "You're still so shy." He wrote something else, and I found myself turning my back, and I was looking down at the paper. I was trembling. The last word that came out of his mouth was, "Show me." He'd never made me, not even in high school. And here was a boy I didn't even know stripping off his clothes in her bedroom. "Show me." He was staring at my bare breasts and my nipples were erect and stiff at the thought.</p> <p>When I looked back at him, he stood up and took off the shirt. His nipples, though, were very sensitive. My hands flew to my face. "I love you so much, Nick."</p> <p>I was crying. "I love you too, Nick." And I turned around to face him. Our lips met. I was so shocked. I'm so ashamed. So embarrassed. "I'm so sorry I scared you." "I'm so proud of you," he said. He kissed the top of my head.</p> <p>"No, no, you weren't scared. I love you. I just don't know what happened. I have no idea what we did. It just happened. I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed that I did it, I've just never done it before. I can't explain what I did." My voice was trembling with fear. I wanted him to touch me. I wanted to wrap me in his arms and hold me. He kissed my lips again and he was kissing me. We could have gone to that place in hell. There were so many things we could have done to each other. There was much that I could never go through. What would have happened? What would have happened between me and my friend. Would we have done something else? Would he go too far? I was scared. I was afraid that he might just go farther than he might have done before. There was no turning back now.</p> <p>My fear gave me away. "No, we can't do that. That's not right. I'm not you." I pulled him into my arms, shaking. The tears were falling. I was shaking. But Nick was there with me, holding me and so handsome. He was my friend, and nothing had ever happened between my friend and I. I was trembling. I had a hard time keeping my hands off of him. I couldn't take my skirt off anymore. I had to keep my hands off of him. And my breasts were shaking, and my legs were trembling. I couldn't get my hands off of him. I had to hide my nakedness.</p> <p>I let Nick go. He held his face in my hands, and looked down at his handiwork. It looked like it was covered in a smear of the blood that was already showing on his knuckles, and itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
