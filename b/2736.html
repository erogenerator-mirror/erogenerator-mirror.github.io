I mean he was pretty nice looking, in my opinion anyway. But I was pretty nervous about the whole thing and I just kept trying to figure out some way to change the subject. When he'd turn back around to look at me I'd be thinking "that's the lookin' I'm gonna get," I was going crazy! I was feeling pretty stupid and I couldn't help thinking of what I'd like to do if we had some kind of sex, what I liked and how I liked it.</p> <p>When he looked up at me in the mirror I noticed his shoulders were broad and he was breathing hard. Just then he got his dick back in his pants. I knew that I'd made him uncomfortable talking to me the way he was and that would do it for him if I didn't stop at a point. He made me jump.</p> <p>Once I took my bra off and I'm sure my nipples were poking right through my shirt I felt very exposed. I wasn't feeling quite as uncomfortable as I was a moment ago since I really didn't have a plan. When I'd unhooked my bra and looked in the mirror I was pretty relieved to see that I looked pretty damn good, which caused me to really feel like that was an incredible compliment.</p> <p>"That's the look you think's gonna get me? Well, we're both naked now, so I'm sure you'd want my naked body anyway." So as it turned out he'd had plenty of chances to strip with the exception of his trunks.</p> <p>Then he began to undress too. His whole body stood out and looked good. He had a cute and muscular, dark, dark torso, like it was made for a body builder, and it turned me on to know that my boy had such an impressive looking body. "Now that you're out of your clothes and all worked up, what do you want me to do with that?" I asked. I wanted him to get this close to me and hold me.</p> <p>"Well, I like some light touching, so I'd like some light petting, and then we'd have more to play at."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so touched and excited that you're gonna do that. You're so nice to touch, I feel like I want this to go somewhere. "</p> <p>He really laughed when I said that and just shook his hand. After we were nude again I took my shirt off and he sat down in the chair by my computer. He told me to take my shirt off too, just in case he wanted more. I just stood there and watched him work out and I really was feeling kind of weird. I mean I had heard him in the gym all the time and all the other guys had done the same thing, so what was he thinking about me as he worked out? It wasn't anything I had planned for me to do, but he was really good and it just seemed a little strange.</p> <p>After he was finished with his work out he stopped his on hand work and asked me to lie down on the bed and put my feet up on the end of it. I didn't hesitate and pulled my legs up on the pillow and spread my legs. He didn't seem to be disappointed to see that my panties were off, although he wasn't saying anything. He crawled over to the bed and climbed on to it.</p> <p>"Honey, I think I might just cum right here, you just watch."</p> <p>He wasn't wrong in that one, either. I almost got the sense of a dream where he'd cum on the bed right there. He was so turned on that it felt like a lifetime before I felt it. I was still kind of surprised that I liked it, but it felt like my pussy was on fire. If I hadn't had my pussy hair all over and when he went down to it, I'm not sure which one of two things felt hotter at the start of a session.</p> <p>It didn't take long, he had me on my own. That was the real thing. I didn't even realize what a nice feeling he was taking until he slid his dick into my pussy and started to give me a nice hard, long and easy stroke. That is what I needed to get him aroused and I came again. It seemed like it would never end.</p> <p>"Are you all right? Are you all right because... because of what you did?" He was all talk and then he was all serious and I was all hot and bothered. He didn't say anything during the last several minutes, just kept pulling and turning me on. He seemed to like it. I was his for now.</p> <p>"You're not going to tell anyone, do you think? I got carried awayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
