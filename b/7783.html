She screamed out, a flood of emotions crashing through her being.</p> <p>Her husband's fingers were now deep inside her. "Oh my god," she thought as he made sure none of the inside of her sex was being touched with his fingers by what seemed like a million hands. She began to feel him moving his digits inside her, rubbing her g-spot. The pleasure was so intense it pushed her body into a state of bliss. She was screaming with orgasm, almost screaming out his name! She was lost in bliss after orgasm.</p> <p>He leaned over her, his mouth now on hers, his hard cock now pushing up against her. She felt him take her hands and place them around him. He then began to slide out of her again. It was so much bigger than before! She could feel how he was getting ready to slide out but then he began to slide them back in... he began in again. "Oh god baby!" She whimpered out again.</p> <p>She felt him sliding all the way into her. "Oh god!" She screamed again.</p> <p>His head was pressed down against her left shoulder. It began to feel incredible. She grabbed her legs around his waist and lifted herself up off the toilet seat. He began to slide his cock in and out of her again. His pubic hair and hand were sliding over her clitoris while his cock was pounding in and out of her. She was almost passing out from excitement. He felt her juices running down his cock and felt her shaking all over. She screamed once more as his orgasm hit. He felt the orgasm hit him and was ready to come at the same time. He was thrusting deeper and deeper, feeling like he might cum out of control.</p> <p>He began to pump his fingers up into her as he pumped his cock in and out of her. He didn't stop thrusting. He was humping in and out, his pubis pressing her back onto the toilet seat. He was coming hard! He was in ecstasy. He couldn't control it any more. He came and came, his hot cum shooting up from his balls and into her. He felt her entire body shake with each jerk of his body pressing his cock to her. She felt her husband's cock pulsing in her as it exploded inside her and felt his cum shooting into her. She was shaking and shuddering with each powerful movement of his hips. She moaned through the final thrust of orgasm, feeling her husband's cock moving deep inside of her.</p> <p>"Oh, god that was fucking good!" She said out loud. "I wish I was there!" She said as she closed her eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
