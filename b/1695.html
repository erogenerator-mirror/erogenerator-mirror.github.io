She was grinning this time with a huge, happy grin.</p> <p>"It's a good thing we know that our customers are on a budget," she said to make it sound like I was not serious. I was in heaven and I thought that if she only knew what I was thinking, the least I could do when I turned down a sale by asking for a sale for myself was to be happy and go along with it. "We just might even make a good first time customer today."</p> <p>I was trying to imagine what it would be like to run into the woman wearing white bikini top, but even she said my fantasies for today would not be the kind of fantasies you thought about. I couldn't say a thing as she finished dressing her. "We're here for ten minutes," I said. "I'll see you in five." I walked to the back and waited as my wife continued watching her model lingerie while she was dressing.</p> <p>I was sure that all the customers in the room were already waiting for me when my wife turned on the camera to the left a camera and the right camera to the far side of the room with the lights down low. "Ok, everybody ready?" I said to the crowd and everyone stood up and started chanting.</p> <p>"No, no!"</p> <p>"Not one!" my wife yelled. The room went crazy with applause. "Don't think we're kidding. It's for you," she said as she walked towards me. I turned a round corner and she walked right up to me. "Good morning," she said as she wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me. She kissed me deeply and passionately while rubbing my crotch through my pants. She stepped back and pulled her top off, exposing her breasts. "I don't wear any panties for you right now," she said as she pulled her thong off. Before I could say anything she was sitting on the bed in her panties. I was a bit amazed but then she stood up and put on a robe and started walking away, only to smile at me as she was still naked except for the robe.</p> <p>"You should do something," I said to her. I was sure that the whole night was ruined because I was starting to enjoy myself, but I still felt that I needed to make sure. I walked towards the door and grabbed the keys of the van before I left. I walked by the front desk where there were five people in their room, and saw both of them waving me right in the door. I was very excited thinking that the whole night would be over. I took the van and headed home. I was glad that when we were in that moment that we could say our goodbyes to each other. As I pulled up I told my wife that "one of the things we love most about each other is a love story I wrote that can never be taken down again," I said. "It's for you."</p> <p>My wife said, "you're right."</p> <p>We never spoke about our past customers since that day. We were good customers and we loved our customers to be. We just don't think about it much. I never made that a part of our customer fantasies, but it's what I didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
