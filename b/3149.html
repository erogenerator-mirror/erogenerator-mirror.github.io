My mind was on the idea of us, Trissie and I, in the bed together, and how it would feel having her in my arms; knowing that the time was not quite over. It was very real, and I wanted it to be real with her. As we arrived at the bar, it was empty, as though it had never been.</p> <p>"You're really good at that, don't you?" Trissie said. She had this look on her face that made me want to kiss her again, and I felt her hand stroke my arm.</p> <p>"I think I would have to say that," I said, and Trissie's hand moved to my stomach and rested there. She squeezed my arm gently as we walked over and I saw the smile in her eyes, and as we walked, she let her hand drop to the crook of my elbow and lifted me to face her in one big sweeping move. It was all that either of us were thinking or thinking it was over. We stopped and Trissie turned to face me. She moved closer and I turned to kiss her and then she pulled herself against me, and with little effort, I was able to feel the heat of her breast against me. Her kiss opened my heart and her tongue dived inside me and I felt myself hardening against her. Our kiss became more wanton with each second but I knew she was in no hurry. It was just a kiss and she broke away to make a drink.</p> <p>Suddenly, she stood up and turned to face me, my head felt the faint aroma of her perfume, which was very enticing. Without a thought I raised my hands to her waist and slowly pulled her close to me. I slipped one hand over her breast and felt the soft swell of her breast under the jacket and as I held her waist, I put my arms around her and pulled her into my chest. I moved my arms upwards until they were almost over her breasts and as we turned our faces, I felt her hand slip down and under my arm and her fingers went to my armpit and she stroked my face, my nose, my mouth, and then to my lips. I kissed her lightly on the lips, first just a little, then deeper, until I felt her lip come in contact with my lips. I opened my mouth to her tongue, and my heart beat picked up as we tongued each others lips.</p> <p>I felt her hand wander downwards to my belly and she caressed me until she got to my belt and slowly undid the button and the zip of my trousers. With my trousers and shorts being pulled down, I let my hands wander over her body which, when it was revealed, was very erotic. The skirt had ridden a little higher up her thigh which I lifted the hem and ran my fingers over her, feeling the firmness of her thighs, I heard her breathing come in short gasps as I ran my hand over the firm roundness of her buttocks. She put her arms around my neck and her hips lifted off the seat of the chair as my hand sought entry to her pussy, where I felt the heat of her sex and was amazed at her wetness.</p> <p>"Fuck me, I want to be touched while you're doing that to me," she whispered and in one swift movement, she lifted her hips and took my cock in her hand to steady it at her pussy and guiding it to her.</p> <p>With a quick glance round the bar, I knew that the others wanted to sit down so I moved to do so, and when we were on the floor I pushed hard into her and held myself as deep as she allowed. My cock was rigid and felt full as I pushed it into her as far as I could reach, and as I felt my cock swell and the first surge come through me, I pushed hard till it hit the back of her bottom and she threw her head back, her mouth wide open and her eyes were bright red as her body tensed and shook on top of mine, her legs locked round me, and her orgasm ripped through her. It seemed like forever as her body writhed against my body and with an almighty groan she collapsed on top of me.</p> <p>"I've never had anyone do anything like that before, was all I could moan as my legs slid apart and my cock slid from between her hands as she held it between her thighs. It seemed only fair for us both that we also enjoyed the experience.</p> <p>I lay there for a while, her arms and body on me, her lips to mine, our breathing gradually returning to normal and we both relaxed into the moment, her head rested on my shoulder and mine on her shoulder, both still covered in perspiration, my arms around her, her breasts on my chest and her lips on mine.
