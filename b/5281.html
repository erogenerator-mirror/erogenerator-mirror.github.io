It was a tight fit as I was trying not to wiggle as much as I felt. I stopped in the middle of the room as Tina stood there with a new pair of jeans on. She turned around to face me so I could get a better look at her. She had on a white top that hung almost to the small of her back. She also had on a pair of light, mid-thigh, sandals that she was sliding on to her feet. They looked more like a pair of little ball gags, but had a purpose. I had to admit they were great on her. She smiled and put a hand on my arm as she took my hand and led me to the fitting room. I couldn't help but look at her as we walked in. Just the thought made me tingle as Tina's touch sent thrills of desire rushing back through me.</p> <p>"I'm glad I put you in my outfit, and I've got just a little bit of the shopping to do before we leave," Tina said as she led me into the fitting room. I couldn't help but to stand there listening to the sounds of the people in the fitting room as they went on and on about their day. It had been quite some time since I was at home and I was surprised at how loud that was.</p> <p>"I'd love a drink after this," I said as I turned to face Tina as it seemed that the fitting room was almost full.</p> <p>"That would be nice,"</p> <p>Tina just looked at me as if trying to figure out what was wrong with me, but I couldn't tell if she understood but was sure that it was going to become a routine for awhile.</p> <p>"I have an idea. Why don't it go over in front of the mirrors while we wait for the fitting people?"</p> <p>"Sure, I'll be back in a few minutes. You can go over to the mirrors and let me get into my outfit," I said as I walked away toward the back of the fitting room.</p> <p>I turned to look at all the mirrors in the store, while I waited. In the reflection in the mirror, two people stood side by side. They were leaning against the wall, talking and laughing away, one was talking to one another while the other just watched. I turned to try to figure out how to tell which person was whom and where they were. The door was opened to the same part of the changing room as the fitting room. I looked at the mirrors to see what was in front and in side. Sure enough, the mirror was one side, and the other side was facing from opposite end of mirror. My hands shook a bit as I started to move the mirror closer. My eyes were glued to the mirrors as I looked around the fitting room. I didn't even see a person that I wanted to try something on, but just felt and was looking at what was around them. I looked up to see what the person in front of me looked like, but couldn't take my eyes off the mirror. She was wearing a black, sheer, half shirt that barely covered the bottom of her breasts. The back was a short black, sleeveless cotton fabric that I could feel that she wasn't wearing a bra. The front was covered with a very thin layer of fabric that just covered her from the neck down.</p> <p>I stood there watching as she started to move around me, and the more she did the more turned on I was getting. We both got to the mirror about half way, and she spun around and put her hands on the armrests of the room mirror. I was standing just a step right in front of the person in front of me. Her eyes were fixed on the mirror and was looking her up and down as she walked around me. Her right hand went to my head as her other hand grabbed the top of my shirt a little and pulled it up. My arms were still shaking a bit, and I didn't know if I was going to make it through. All of a sudden, her right hand was back around my head as her left hand came around and started to circle myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
