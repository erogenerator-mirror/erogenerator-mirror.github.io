My salary went past the $5 per hour minimum wage, and had me starting a construction company a few hours away from home. I was just finishing the 3rd shift when I took a sudden glance out the window.</p> <p>I didn't realize that I had stopped by the store, but I had a quick glance around to make sure that everything was alright, but all I could see was the woman working the front counter. The saleswoman was pretty good, in her mid forties, but still attractive, and she was just shy of 5'5" she was short with smallish breasts a little more than average, but they really stood out on her 5'5" frame. She was wearing a small light weight cotton blouse that looked as though it was made of silk, a loose white sweater, and a black skirt. Her shoes might be a little old, but they looked very sexy for this store. The saleswoman walked up to the counter as the woman in the window was leaving. Just as she was about to leave, the young guy at the register leaned over and whispered in my ear, "Hey, you need the money up front too?" The salesgirls name was Susan, and we exchanged business cards. Susan started walking along the aisle with me. I was sure that she must have a job at some other site, but I was not paying much attention.</p> <p>At that point the manager came over to talk to us. The man was at least 5'10" and built like a brick shit house, and his brown hair was a little bit darker than the rest of him. "Mr. Davis, this is Tom" he said, shaking my hand. "Susan, you're not really working up here, but we could help," he said. We looked him over briefly, shook hands, and then he turned around and left the store, returning into the hallway. As the manager turned the corner to walk out of our store, I noticed that Susan was smiling brightly at me.</p> <p>I said, "Uh, thanks. I guess they might ask for my money?"</p> <p>"Sure," she replied. "This is my husband's job. Why don't you call him when you come in? My husband works nights, too, though, so I wouldn't know you were there."</p> <p>"Sure," I replied. "It's okay, I usually just come in from the back door." We continued walking through the store towards the back. It was only 5pm when we left the store, and I was going to head back to my apartment to work up a load before work so I could head over to Susan's. I wanted to be home from work in plenty of time to call her a lot.</p> <p>The second part of our conversation that night was a little different. As we were finishing our last drink of the day, I turned to offer her a seat on the couch, "Susan, how about a show?" As we started to say goodnight, she paused, looked at me, and then glanced up.</p> <p>She flashed her killer smile from ear to ear and nodded. She turned back toward me, took my face into her hands, slowly raised my lips to hers, and softly kissed me. She pulled me close, pressing her lips deeply against mine as our tongues fought and her hands moved down my front until they were on my cock. She rubbed me through my jeans, while she pushed and ground my cock into her thigh. I felt my cock harden in her hand as our kiss grew more intense.</p> <p>I pulled back from her kiss reluctantly, my hand went to undo my button. "Take off your shirt," I said, "It's been awhile since I've spent so much time alone." When she did as she was told, my hand went around to her back, she pushed my hand away slowly. She ran her hands down over her breasts, letting her nipples gently push against my fingers, before slowly turning her body toward me. Her nipples were hard, a pink color, and very large; they pressed into the edge of my palm. She turned slowly, still facing me, and put her shirt back over her breasts, making them look even larger, and looking a little larger. When she bent her knees a little bit, I pulled my hand from her lap and brought it down to lightly brush her belly. As her skin was flushed and hot, her shorts were soaked in the crotch and her panties were soaked through. As her shirt came down off her body, she tossed it over the back of the couch, and then grabbed my hand and pulled me toward her with both of hers. I could feel her breasts, nipples, and all around her body as I went around to the top of her, kissing herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
