All during the night I still loved my husband but he was nothing but trouble and I knew deep down he didn't deserve the love and affection I had and had for him.</p> <p>By morning the memories that I'd had with them, they'd also left me aching for my husband. My hands were shaking and I could feel my tummy tighten up. When we finally got to our bedroom my heart stopped. I was going to be all alone. I was going to look for a new, sexy man and if I did find one he was going to be a lot better, for me alone.</p> <p>I threw on a negligee and a pair of panties that looked even better in the light. If my husband wasn't home I would be in for much more fun then I could have, and once I was ready I would take care of his needs.</p> <p>He was always so sweet and he had a way of moving my body in a way that sent my mood soaring and my mind spinning. I was wearing black stockings and I loved the silky feeling. Then when I ran cold water on myself I realized my nipples were already poking out and begging to be tweaked. I slipped on the negligee and ran outside in the heat. "I can't go outside with nothing on." I told myself. As if to prove it I ran into the back door and closed it. The warmth of the room was getting to me and I couldn't bear it.</p> <p>I ran into the hot tub and jumped in. The smell of the air in there was intoxicating and making me think I wanted to go in and enjoy it. I felt like I was floating in a pool, just being on my back and being very aware of my husband in the other room.</p> <p>He was naked and when he reached over to me I turned slowly to face him and I couldn't hide my disappointment. His body was amazing and he was all mine. I had no one right beside me. Even if I wanted him I would never agree to go outside with my husband.</p> <p>He stepped up between my legs and I felt his hard cock pressing against my ass. "God you are so beautiful and sexy, but my wife was my first." He breathed into my ear.</p> <p>"Do it. Do anything." I told him.</p> <p>He began kissing me and pulling me against him. I opened my legs for him and feeling his cock pressing against my thigh I knew I would be helpless if he didn't continue. I wanted this! I needed that cock inside of me.</p> <p>He turned me around and he lifted my negligee and his mouth moved lower and he touched the very tip of his tongue to my slit. Oh God, what he did to me made me gasp and I had to do what he wanted. I lifted a leg and opened myself wider as much as the tiny bikini cut would allow me. He lifted me and I was able to wrap that wonderful pussy and I wanted this so bad. I wanted this and needed it.</p> <p>He slid first one finger and then another into me. He moved them in and out and when he felt how good it felt I knew I won't last long. He pushed them inside and as he did I felt just how wet I was. It felt so good. I could feel it running down to my bottom lip. That made me want him even worse I let myself cum for him.</p> <p>I knew I didn't have the breath I really wanted, but my body went as far as I wanted. I pulled his body closer as he continued to work his fingers inside of me. I needed him so much my body went wild for him.</p> <p>I was lost in that moment, all of my fears gone, all I was. I couldn't think, I couldn't control myself any longer. I had to feel him enter my body, feel him in me. It wasn't fair for my first time since the divorce to feel like that and to be so intimate with another man.</p> <p>My body was on fire. As his fingers slid in and out, in and out, I could feel each of them. My head was spinning and just the thought that this had to be him did me in.</p> <p>I felt the heat of his body, it was so close and it made me crazy. It seemed like I couldn't see a single hair on his upper chest hair and he had to lean into me to reach my head.</p> <p>I held on to him and felt him move against me. I wanted him. All the while our sounds were still echoing from outside. I was afraid to breath but I couldn't stop it anymore. I couldn't stop wanting him. I wanted him and I couldn't stop myself!</p> <p>I felt him begin to thrust hard into me and I held on as best Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
