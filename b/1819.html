I had nothing to lose.</p> <p>I started to rub my swollen clit, knowing it was going to take him a while before I would be able to get off. Suddenly I felt him start to shake beneath me and started to lose it. His hand fell upon my clit and he started a slow, steady fucking motion. His hand left my clit and I felt him start to pound into me from behind. His cock plowed deep into me as he started to cum on my ass. I screamed out again and fell onto the bed, but he never stopped.</p> <p>He got off me and rolled out of bed, looking around. "It's your turn, too." I said into the air, laying there panting. I felt his hands leave my ass and his cock enter me. He fucked me slowly and deliberately as he told me how lucky I was that he was single and wanted the chance to use me like a fuck toy. I looked at him, and for a split second it was just one man and two women, but then he bent forward and licked my clit. I was surprised that it gave me such pleasure and that I wanted it so bad. He continued to please me until I was on the edge of another powerful orgasm, but was not as good as the first, which left me disappointed. I smiled and got off the bed.</p> <p>"I need to return the favor," I said.</p> <p>He sat up and turned around. He entered me again and slowly fucked me, getting closer to his own peak of pleasure. I looked at him and said, "I want you to cum for me."</p> <p>He nodded and started to stroke in and out. His eyes were locked with mine with lust, but also with curiosity. I reached my hand into my robe pocket, and found his cock. I started to stroke it as I watched him fuck me. His eyes locked on mine as I took his cock into my mouth. His hips started to move faster as his hands found my tits. He bent forward and started to finger me. I had one of my nipples into his mouth as we made out and started to suck down on his cock. He was now fucking me faster. His fingers were circling my clit, and I felt my knees weaken and my toes curl. I was in another world as he kept fucking me to his own orgasm.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum. I'm going to cum," he said, his face looking so hot there, as he held onto to my hips and he pounded into me as load after load went into my insides. I felt his balls tighten and held onto my hips. He fucked me with all he had, and it got him going again, too. As his pace slowed, he collapsed on top of me, holding onto me with his hands. He kissed me and said, "My turn." Then I pulled him down on the bed with me, pulling him as I did so. I pulled his head to mine and as soon as he took my nipple into his mouth, I gave him the tongue fuck he deserved. Within minutes we were both moaning in pleasure. We looked at each other, and grinned. We kissed again, this time passionately.</p> <p>"Thank you, Jack," I said, pulling back so I could see his face. His eyes were glazed over and his lips were stretched outward as he gasped. I could tell he was about to cum. His breathing was ragged. "I want your cum in my mouth." I pushed his legs apart and ran my tongue over his balls, licking and running it around. I sucked his balls into my mouth and cupped them as they contracted. I then pushed them from my mouth a bit, and slid a finger into his ass. I felt him shutter, and heard him moan. It was too much for me as I felt our juices run down my thighs, as he released his load into my mouth. I tasted it, and it was so sweet, that I almost wanted to devour it. We sat in silence for a long time, my body tingling and his being heavy in my arms.</p> <p>I felt like so much like a porn queen as we lay together, my hand cupping his cum-filled balls as my tongue licked his cum off my fingers. I took off his blindfold and looked to him. I kissed him gently as I did so.</p> <p>"You're mine this morning too." We lay there, talking for what seemed like an hour. I told him about my job and what I had done. I learned that he worked as a waiter in the City. We met up with a friend and went on a month long cruise, a wonderful vacation that left us in a perfect place. We took a cab to the airport and rented a limousine to go to the city. The limo had a view from the oceanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
