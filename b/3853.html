The reason they call it 'nice', is because, in their words, their clit-teasers, they're supposed to come on my tongue. Because I'm getting a guy off, of course, by sucking his dick, not his tits... which is only the second time they've let me do that. So they say that men aren't supposed to come on the girl's tits. But it happened that way, though I admit, I've never felt the urge to do it, other than just stare at a guy, and it's like my whole world revolves around the penis.</p> <p>I love to come in the mouth, because it seems so good to me when a guy gives me handjobs. And I don't mind watching porn, and sometimes the guys I'm with are just watching it, with some extra help. I like the idea of watching it and, if I'm a guy, I'm just jerkin' around, trying to get him off.</p> <p>My sister and I had some trouble getting together. I was a little uncertain of myself, and how it might go. But I didn't think too much of it, and I ended up talking straight to her.</p> <p>In the process I learned a lot about myself. I knew everything about myself from reading online, so I was prepared for what I'd know. I told her what I wanted, and if she wanted to join in on the experience with me, she'd do it.</p> <p>The more I learned, the more I was curious. I learned about myself, and what it takes to get a guy off. The more I learned about myself and the things I had known about myself, and how to get it through, I realized that I really needed to be that person, because if I didn't, what would I do.</p> <p>"Honey," I said to her, "if I'm not sure about my technique, I'll just go off at the moment, and you're not there, can you keep your end of it? I'd like to come in your mouth."</p> <p>"Of course," she told me, "I think that's the way things should be. You should suck his cum off your tongue, because that's the best technique in the world for it."</p> <p>That was something I never would have thought I'd experience. I never had this level of self-control. And this kind of stuff was out of my own hands.</p> <p>In one, quick, fluid motion, I reached my left arm past her and grabbed my penis and put it in her mouth. I took a minute, working it up and down her wet slit, and finally put one hand under the bottom of her head and worked her tongue over it again.</p> <p>It went in a little easier than before, because I'd have to control the angle to get it in, because in just this position my penis was being drawn out, so it was easier to let me go easy on her. For a woman this way, on the other hand, she wasn't as hot as she thought, but I really started to enjoy her face-job, because it gave me an idea.</p> <p>"I love when you try to put your hand in my panties," I told her, "and I know you are wet... you're really horny."</p> <p>She smiled and nodded. "Do you think I'll put my panties on, and then we're gonna get naked... or whatever... right there?" She didn't finish what she had started with the fingers.</p> <p>"It looks like you want to go that hard way with it," I told her, and I took a second or so to glance around. "It feels pretty natural, though, to be a guy and have all these people watching you suck him off."</p> <p>"Don't I need to ask you a question?" she asked. "Did you come over here to say 'yes,'" she looked at the men standing around her, "because he might just get hard."</p> <p>"Oh, sorry," I told her, "I think you did, and I'm sure he's not disappointed."</p> <p>I knew exactly what she meant, because my dick had been in her mouth less than a minute or so ago, and I had her bent over my knee, and was using her mouth as a cock-sucking tool. I could see her ass, and that her eyes were shut, but I knew that she was smiling at me.</p> <p>"Do you want to put something on it in a moment, since he said that you came back here?" she said to me, and then winked at the men at us.</p> <p>"Oh, no, not yet," I told her. "You'll be too busy to do that at the momentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
