"I am good." It was my first line of speech.</p> <p>He took his hand from my back, and ran the tip of his finger across the line of my back, over my spine and down on my buttock.</p> <p>I shivered. "That's nice. You never told me what you liked about kissing."</p> <p>I looked at him, and he grinned, and leaned closer.</p> <p>"I like the kiss better, though...because you are so fucking sexy."</p> <p>He leaned back, and turned the water off. "What?"</p> <p>"I want to kiss..."</p> <p>"Then just let me do it."</p> <p>"Okay, fine." I felt him move against me. "Do it."</p> <p>I wrapped my arms around him, and he moved my hands down to his waistband. When my fingers started moving back to feel him, he slid his hands down to my hips, and helped me lift my top up.</p> <p>"We have to stop," he whispered as he slid his hands under the bottom of the bathing suit.</p> <p>He gently pulled it up over my head, and I stepped out, then pulled his trunks down. I was happy to see that his penis was already growing, even without his hand on it.</p> <p>I reached behind me to take my own trunks off as well, which I did without a moment's hesitation, stepping out of them with him. I pulled my own top off a second later. I slid them down over my shoulders and stepped out of them, then tossed them in the corner. I was pleased to see that it wasn't the biggest cock on this world, but it had a decent hunk of meat to it, too. For it, I think, it was bigger than I'd expected.</p> <p>It was a good thing that I'd taken care of before, as he moved closer, and pressed his lips to mine.</p> <p>"I..."</p> <p>"Shh..."</p> <p>His hands slid over my body, and traced my breasts through my bathing suit, before coming back up to my torso.</p> <p>He lifted me up, and turned our showerheads so the water would be nice. We stood there in silence for a moment, and I suddenly realized that I hadn't even spoken to him.</p> <p>I turned around, and kissed him hard, but he pulled back.</p> <p>"Later," he said softly. "Later will be fine. In fact, come with me."</p> <p>We walked back into the hotel room of our respective families, and went downstairs to the living room where we settled down on the couch together. I put my hand on his chest through the towel, pressing against him as his hand went to my breasts, and slowly fondled and kneaded them.</p> <p>"Oh, yes...I like that," I said.</p> <p>"I know, your father and I would like to hear all about it," he replied.</p> <p>"Yeah, and we have to talk to my aunt about it..." I whispered to him.</p> <p>"Yeah. Well, we'll just pretend that we're parents," he replied. "Why don't you come over to our place and fuck my brains out while we talk about my mom in bed."</p> <p>My heart skipped a beat at that. I thought I was going to explode. He knew what I did all the time, not to question his advice, but when my dad told me what he'd heard, I could see that my mother was no longer the lady I'd once been, but something else that a part of the game just existed because I wanted to feel that man inside of me.</p> <p>"I'll go, mom..." I replied hesitantly, "I don't want to..."</p> <p>"I want you to, baby. Go with me."</p> <p>I walked slowly over, but I knew I wanted to say something first. Then I saw some of the things he'd read about me in his stories, and I wondered what to say.</p> <p>"Come on back with me," he urged me.</p> <p>"I...I really don't want to...do this..." I whispered, and took his hand to the couch.</p> <p>"Me neither. Go with...me."</p> <p>He kissed my cheek before he pulled me onto the couch, and pulled his trunks back up and off.</p> <p>His penis was now pointing straight up at me, and I reached out to pull it down. We embraced, briefly, before I had to ask, "Do you want to fuck my mom?"</p> <p>"You want to make sure that her..." I trailed off.</p> <p>"I'm going to love you," he laughed, and then we both broke out laughingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
