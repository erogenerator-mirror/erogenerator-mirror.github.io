You're getting the hang of it quick."</p> <p>She giggled and pouted a little. "I wish I could. But it's been a while. I really don't want to be the only one left on this flight. Let them go with us out for the rest of the night."</p> <p>They giggled about it for an hour. When they finally left the table, she turned back to him and said, "I want to take my clothes and lay in bed in the morning, but I also want to fuck you right here, in the bed." She smiled and said, "We'll stop by the room in the afternoon so we can freshen up and take things off. Is that okay with you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you can change here into something that you wouldn't need to use that first day on our honeymoon. Your husband is going to have an absolute hard on when I'm around."</p> <p>"Oh, really? Are we okay with being naked in the bed together now?"</p> <p>"Of course we are. You can take as much time as you like when you're on top, but I don't think I'm going to be naked on top. Let's get off this bed and go take a shower together." He stood up as she followed him from his bathroom and took her hand. Together they walked down the hall for a few moments. "Can I go get a robe and stuff while you're at it?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm out of clothes and in bed. I'll get one if you like, too."</p> <p>As she sat on the bed, he asked, "Well, if you think we should, I'll join you in the tub and show you how I have to use a razor and the enema kit." A little of the wine had made her body glisten and she giggled a little.</p> <p>"Oh I'd love to watch that, but this isn't what I had in mind. This is all just a way of getting out, right? I'm still a little nervous about actually going through with this. Let's get into the water, see how it goes."</p> <p>As they got into the tub, they kissed deeply for a minute. He said, "I'm sorry about not being able to control myself the first time we made love. I'm not that man." She chuckled and said, "You can come with me if you want. I haven't yet had a chance to actually have you in the tub. I think you can make me feel a bit more comfortable." And just before he got his breath back she said, "Let me know if you want me in the tub now. Just lie back and relax while I get dressed."</p> <p>A few minutes later, she came into the room dressed in white satin pajama bottoms and a white tank top. She was standing near the edge of the bed near his feet. He just sat there in the tub facing her. She smiled and said, "Come over here, little one. It's time for me to take good care of you." He stood as she approached. "You can start with these pajamas. After awhile, you can take them off." She handed and the two started off on the trail from their room toward her bedroom. She was careful to stop as he pulled her into a full body hug. Their bodies were pressed tight against each other and her breasts were pressed firmly against him. His erection was almost fully engorged with blood as she slid up against him. Her vagina was just inches from his member. She slid a finger down his stomach to the front of his pants and pulled a little closer to him. She gave him the most sex driven smile and told him "I'm going out the door again today and you can come join us this time."</p> <p>He thought his erection had gone away but it wasn't. He took her arm and they walked out to the door together on foot. She gave her pussy another little squeeze once while they walked out of the airportâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
