She had changed from her casual wear into a much hotter, sexier lingerie set; she was sitting back on the floor next to him with her legs spread wide, giving him a view of her shaved mound and trimmed bush and a swollen clit. She was now sitting in his lap and he was playing with her tits while he talked about meeting her tomorrow, and how much he loved her with his tongue...</p> <p>The thought of him eating her pussy excited her. A couple of months ago he had been a complete pussy licker, and it had been more than just that. She had tasted, enjoyed, and enjoyed. Now the sex was making him even more excited.</p> <p>Their eyes locked, she turned her head around for them and started kissing him, her mouth pressed to his, sharing her cum between them. Her hands reached out and started fondling his huge hard cock. Her hands rubbed their flesh together, teasing them both. He kissed her lower lip, and she responded to his kiss, feeling her mouth part and her tongue probe his lips.</p> <p>Then their lips separated; his eyes said 'I love you, too.' She smiled and said, "Do you want to eat me later?"</p> <p>He was in heaven. "Yes," he answered.</p> <p>"Good. Now, let's go to your bed. I want more."</p> <p>"I love you," he said, taking a long pull on her drink.</p> <p>"I want you in me now," she said softly.</p> <p>He reached down and started unbuttoning her blouse. "I love you, too," he said, pulling away the blouse and taking her bra off for her. He started sucking on her beautiful dark pink nipples, while running his fingers back and forth over her belly. Her hands were already moving down to spread his, stroking his cock. She pulled his head close to her, and he was kissing her hard while she was running her hands over his hairy chest and ass.</p> <p>He stood up, then started kissing her way down her neck and to her tits, where he started kissing first one nipple, then the other. He gently started licking and sucking on her nipples, rolling the soft, pink, hard nubs in his fingers, then licking her areola in between. Her body was moving all over his, rubbing her tits, pushing his head even closer to her. He couldn't get enough of her body.</p> <p>Suddenly, he moved down to her belly, leaving her breasts naked and waiting for him. She spread her legs, and he started kissing her thighs and pussy.</p> <p>"Now eat me, you know I want you to," she said in one long sigh. "Suck my pussy."</p> <p>He got down on his knees and started to lick her pussy. She was moaning, and her scent was very strong. His first lick went a little way into her opening, then into the lips. He tried two or three times, but her juices were very strong and his mouth was getting tired. His finger started to work the outside of her pussy, then entered. The little nub of her clit was hard and he started sucking, then moved to the other side for a while, then went back to the center.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she moaned.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, baby...right there," she said as she spread her legs wider. He moved to her clit, licked and sucked on it. One thing that had gotten her off was sucking tits, of all the attention he was giving them, and her clit was bigger. Her body was writhing and she pulled his head to her pussy faster, moving her hips and sucking his tongue on her pussy, trying to match his mouth on her clit. He kept licking, sucking, and finger fucking her. Her moans were getting louder, she was pushing his head down on her pussy, and she was cumming almost immediately.</p> <p>When he had brought her off, she was breathing hard, her pussy spasms, and her clit throbbing, and when he had licked her clean, he asked her, "Did it feel like that?"</p> <p>She was still shaking, trying to catch her breath. "Fuck, yes, but I've never felt like that before." She smiled, then said, as she got up and started dressing, "I love you, too," then she turned to leave.</p> <p>He pulled his finger from her pussy to turn on his side, facing her. "I love you, too, sweetie," he said as she reached over and took his hand, then gave it a quick kiss on the cheek then left, saying, "I'm going to go and shower. Have a nice sleep, and we'll talk more tomorrow..."</p> <p>"Love you, and good night," she said, then she got up and headed towards the bedroom.</p> <p>Tomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
