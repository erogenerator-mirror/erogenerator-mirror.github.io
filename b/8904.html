I was just getting used to the feeling of being around her, I hadn't felt it for a long time. She seemed like a sweet young girl, even better looking now that she was older, I'm not sure if she knew it yet, although I didn't really care; she was just one of so many things to occupy my thoughts, and I felt a huge amount of joy knowing that I was finally getting it.</p> <p>For the first two weeks I couldn't wait to see her again, I couldn't get her out of my mind, I just couldn't. Her family seemed to come right around for me, and I hadn't felt this much connection with people since mom died. I had never even made it with dad, well, as far as I knew mom was still my best friend, and that was the closest I could come to really dating anyone so far.</p> <p>Finally it was Wednesday, mom was out of town at our friends house all day and wouldn't return until after lunch. Finally I called Chris to ask him if we could go over to talk on my Harley and see if they were coming up anytime after work on Monday.</p> <p>"Chris!" I turned into the parking lot, "are you there?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I just got done talking with mom," he replied. "We'll pick it up after lunch, should be there in an hour!"</p> <p>"I'll be there in twenty," I promised.</p> <p>I got into my car, and before Chris could protest I pulled out and off to the corner of the road. The Harley was already running through the streets and Chris already had to be to work to get to work.</p> <p>"I was just going to come and see you!" Chris's voice said through the phone.</p> <p>"I guess it's good to have you around in case you change your mind," I replied.</p> <p>"I'm actually glad to hear you like yourself," he replied before hanging up the phone. "There's more than just talking about her, I'm going to have to go back to the house and see if we can come up with something for lunch. Would that be okay with you?"</p> <p>"Of course it's okay, I'm ready." I replied, "Come on with me if you want to eat, we have some sandwiches."</p> <p>We quickly went back to working in the parking lot. Just before I got to her again she paused for a moment and said, "I'll just grab my things before we get in the car." I immediately started to say something but couldn't say anything. She just walked toward me, taking my hand as she got closer. I could smell her perfume, it was so perfect for her hair and the scent of soap she used every night.</p> <p>As she got in the passenger seat she leaned over and planted a quick kiss on my lips. I could feel her soft breast pressed into my side under my shirt, "What?" was all that escaped my lips.</p> <p>"I'm so glad I found myself in the state you were back in, it made me feel right at ease talking with you!" She replied.</p> <p>"I think we've both been a little lost in our thoughts," was my attempt at humor.</p> <p>"I'm not so sure of that," she said, "you know you can't just let me get away from now."</p> <p>"Well, maybe just this once. We'll see about that, we'll need a plan," I said quickly.</p> <p>We just leaned on each other, the feel of our naked bodies pressed together felt so good, we only got out of sight as we leaned over the car so she could get back into the driver's seat. As we were getting in she leaned across my chest to kiss me as her hands went to my pants. As she un-clasped my belt she slipped her hand inside my fly and down to my dick and squeezed it softly.</p> <p>"I have something planned for today," I replied.</p> <p>"What's that?" she asked with a small smile.</p> <p>"I have a surprise for you today," I said. "I hope you're okay with your surprise?"</p> <p>"I'm ready," she said with a smile.</p> <p>I let her get back into the motorcycle and into the passenger seatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
