You can imagine that you cannot wait until the morning to be with her, but the anticipation is killing you.</p> <p></p> <p>Dressed in my clothes, I sat in my office chair. It wasn't very comfortable, but when one thing is comfortable and you begin to think it may not be so after all.</p> <p>I was alone in my office, my desk and my door open. I had my cell in my lap, waiting to ring. The phone ringing was not unexpected. I was a senior secretary working with Mr. Jameson. This man was so handsome! He was tall, handsome, fit, with strong jaw, long dark hair, and a rugged kind of smile that looked great on his face.</p> <p>"You have an early call, Ms. Carrington!" His deep voice rumbled through my mind.</p> <p>"Yes, sir. Where the hell are you at? "My boss didn't respond. I tried to remain calm.</p> <p>I had to make sense of what was going on here, and make it out of this. I had no idea what to say, but he did. I did not have to say anything.</p> <p>When I hung up the phone, I sat up a bit and looked out the window. The office was dark. There wasn't much light outside today, and it all looked quite out of place. I was standing in my office chair, looking out the window and thinking of the man I just met. Just a few feet away, a young woman stood at the end of her desk. I wanted to run.</p> <p>She said something to the sound of the phone. My boss's voice. "That's you, Ms. Carrington. You have an early call. Take them off. You have been served."</p> <p>I was scared, but I could not deny it. There was something about him, something about his voice, that I didn't like. After getting up the nerve to say something, I stood up and slowly stood from my chair.</p> <p>I wanted to do this right, but I was afraid. I wanted to make love to him.</p> <p>I moved slowly around my desk. I leaned over to take his hand and stood on the next to him on the chair. "I've been served sir." I looked at him as I spoke and he looked down at me. I was surprised at how turned on my body had become when I did. Here I was, in my office, in the middle of the morning with a man in my office.</p> <p>He looked me up and down, and smiled. He put his hands on my shoulders and pushed me forward. I had always worn my business suits and suits over the years. Today, they were silk. My secretary uniform blouse was unbuttoned and tied. Mr. Jameson's hands were large and gentle. He took my blouse collar and slowly pulled it down. The button came undone slowly, and I was not sure if he would undo my bra.</p> <p>He slid my blouse off my shoulders and tossed it aside. He unbuttoned my blouse, taking the blouse off as I let it drop to the floor. I stepped out of my shoes and he pushed me back onto my desk. We both stripped.</p> <p>I sat with my legs spread. Just before my knees went down, he slid my black lace panties down my legs. He pushed them down my legs and they fell in a heap around my ankles. I looked up at him as he lifted my leg with his hand and reached down to his underwear to rub my sex. I spread my legs and he ran a couple of fingers over my pussy, then slipped them inside me. He kept moving his fingers in and out of me, and I could not help but imagine his cock doing this to me.</p> <p>I lifted my hips and he pulled his cock out of his pants. My pussy got to feel it. It wasn't the longest penis, but it was large and beautiful. I couldn't wait to have it inside me.</p> <p>My boss took my hand to his hardness. I found it hard and hard and hot. It made me ache for it. I felt a bit scared. What could I do though? He touched my hand and guided it down, and I stroked his cock a bit more before he took his fingers away from my hand. He leaned forward. We didn't kiss. He took my other hand and placed it on his head.</p> <p>I was about to say something, but he took his fingers and pushed my fingers down. I didn't hesitate.</p> <p>"I'll take that as a yes." I leaned over and touched his lips with my lips. He kissed me hard. I was ready for anything, anything at this point, I felt his lips over mine. His tongue pressed into my mouth.
