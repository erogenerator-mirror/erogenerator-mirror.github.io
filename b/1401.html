"I'm just going to rub your back and shoulders as I work out."</p> <p>The thought of having his back massage on a regular basis almost made Sarah feel guilty. "I guess we won't need the bedroom," she said.</p> <p>Sarah and Bill talked for a while about their work and the pros and cons of their options. She was glad to have the opportunity to see if they had sex, though she was sure that sex with Tom would be a lot more enjoyable if Tom was there.</p> <p>"Your back looks great," Sarah said when I offered her a glass of wine. "What is your name?"</p> <p>He said, "Tom. Tom Rogers."</p> <p>"Sarah, this is Tom Rogers, a long time friend of Sarah's. Tom is my assistant. I guess we can call you 'Sarah the night before."</p> <p>"I think I can take it if you want," I said.</p> <p>"No," he said. "I just don't have the energy for regular sex without a partner. Besides, I think you need one now, too."</p> <p>I was happy to take advantage of the situation. I poured the wine and sat in the hot tub.</p> <p>I had a wonderful time. I didn't make love to Tom, and he didn't come between us. He was a sweet and gentle lover, and he didn't seem to mind Sarah playing around with our sex life. I guess you could say he was the best lover I ever had.</p> <p>I made a special dinner for Sarah. After dinner I went in to the bedroom. She was in her bed, waiting to sleep. My cock was getting hard again. I got in bed and got under the covers. It was pretty late and Tom must be going to his office soon. I had just enough time to remove my cock and move in bed with Sarah, but not before I got her and Tom to her bedroom, and we would fuck some more.</p> <p>Sarah came in, totally naked, and joined me. It took a little while to do, but as I lay on my back with her in the middle she straddled me. When we were both fully aroused she pulled the covers down slightly as she sat there taking me in. It was my first time with her. I didn't know what to do.</p> <p>After what seemed like forever I was feeling good. I said, "What's this?"</p> <p>"Oh! You're hard again. I hope it's you I want."</p> <p>I said, "I love you, too."</p> <p>Sarah turned over and lay on her back next to me. She gave me one of her beautiful smiles.</p> <p>I kissed her tenderly. "I love you, Sarah."</p> <p>I ran my hands all over her soft body. After a couple of minutes she said, "Tom doesn't like sex much, and he's got a big cock, but I like to think I'm ready for Tom now.</p> <p>"I love you, too," I replied as I moved between her legs. I slid into her and we started a nice gentle fuck. We fucked until Sarah was moaning loud enough that I doubt many of the neighbors could hear. In no time we were both getting really turned on.</p> <p>We fell asleep together in each other's arms until it was time to get up. When I got up to leave, Sarah got dressed, kissed me, and left. She didn't call to tell me how badly she wanted to see me for a long, long time. I just kissed her and went back to bed.</p> <p>It was about two in the morning when Sarah came home. We had just finished sex, and I didn't even want our relationship to stop. She was still standing there in her robe. I said, "Sarah, I think you've had enough for today. I'm leaving. I just want you to be by yourself for a while. I'll see you tomorrow, and then come get a bath."</p> <p>I turned around, kissed her goodnight, and went back to the bathroom to get a drink of water. When I got back Sarah was in bed asleep. She was naked and still in bed. I thought to myself, "This is the life!"</p> <p>I didn't do anything the next few days, then I started to get it all out. Sarah came home about once every two weeks. She told me how she felt about the previous week, and how it had really changed her life. She was still horny and happy. There was a happy, contented smile on her face the whole time.
