And the lawyer said that just as he turned the car around.</p> <p>And now I was really glad someone was looking out for us so I kept looking at my phone a bit more.</p> <p>Finally the lawyer told me it was now 9:30. I still looked out of the car. The lawyers had taken him outside to talk to a young man who was being looked at me with a "I see you have been looking at me with a look of approval." in his eyes. He looked as if they wanted me to "go look at you with a look of approval."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I mumbled to him. "I just thought you felt that way."</p> <p>The "I see you feel that way" looked like it told me something. And I thought back on it and realized that was the most appropriate term to say about this sort of thing. For a moment I really thought of throwing it "into the wind" and driving away, but instead I just kept looking for somewhere to go with this guy and someplace private.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do this for you?" he asked me after a pause.</p> <p>"Sure," I replied. But then a couple of things occurred to me. How can a guy talk to himself when he and a woman don't mean anything to him? I mean, I'm not "in love" with the other couple in the car or in the restaurant.</p> <p>What was he like? Was he tall? Dark hair? Where was he from? Any one of those things. "But just walk with me..." I added.</p> <p>As we approached the street he stopped and turned up the street. "How about the back?" he asked. But as I turned to continue on, I remembered that wasn't exactly an option. There was something different about the road. It wasn't the road it was on. It was the street. This street. A sidewalk to turn down. And I remembered now that it was the street itself.</p> <p>We pulled up to it. There was a house on the right. I felt really good, and realized I wanted to show him off on my "business card." We got out. We walked to the door and he just looked at me and opened the door.</p> <p>"Thank you very much." I said to him.</p> <p>"I know," he smiled, and we said our goodbyes.</p> <p>"I can't tell you who got the credit card," The lawyer said, but it wasn't exactly a statement. He just walked to the door.</p> <p>He took her card out, and he looked at it for several seconds and then he turned back to me. "And who got the credit card," he stated flatly, but in a very firm voice.</p> <p>I took the card from his hand and looked at it.</p> <p>"Well, I guess we should start with the usual thing," he said, "and then you can choose to get the card out of me now."</p> <p>"But the credit card isn't for you,"</p> <p>"I won't tell you anything about that," he retorted, and then turned to leave the room. But he stopped in his tracks again and spoke to her again.</p> <p>"You get that. It's only a card. Don't you see that? He said and then added, "If you can think of one and it is yours, then I'll be happy to give you one of my own."</p> <p>She smiled back at him. Then he walked to the elevator without looking back. I followed him out of the house and down the hall on the street.</p> <p>"Now where were we?" He asked.</p> <p>"I don't know." I said, and he walked into the house.</p> <p>"Look here, let me help you!" he said, and he closed the door, and as quickly as he stepped past me, he turned and opened the door again. We entered the living room. He stepped away from me and went behind the couch to sit next to her.</p> <p>"This is nice." He said to me. He put his hand on her shoulder.</p> <p>"I know," I smiled. "This feels too much like a business card. That's why we needed to get you out."</p> <p>He just looked at me for a moment and then came out with the card.</p> <p>"Look," he said. "We're both adults here. There's no need to be concerned, if this is what you really want."</p> <p>I just looked at him as he handed me the card. I thought about just saying "okay," and that was fine.
