As they got up, Elizabeth and the other girls, dressed as casually as a woman can, gathered up the clothing and returned to a room, leaving Elizabeth on the balcony, while Samantha remained downstairs to clean up, while the other girls had their own rooms cleaned up, and dressed.</p> <p>They got back to the pool, where they both enjoyed a refreshing swim and lay on a chaise, chatting like old friends.</p> <p>"So, Elizabeth, do you want to go out today?"</p> <p>"I think so, Samantha." Elizabeth knew that the others would too, and she was hoping to meet their new friends from lunch today when they got home.</p> <p>"Well, if Elizabeth's going to, I have no choice. I can hardly get a job!"</p> <p>"Well, it will be my job to get her out of the house! Besides, there is plenty of time to talk in the pool. Let's just get started."</p> <p>It was only a few minutes after they were done in the pool after swimming back-to-back, when a small red light on the poolside phone started playing.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll call on my cell phone, but I just have a message from the resort. Can you let me in?"</p> <p>Elizabeth answered the phone and the girl answered for an hour or so. "Hello. Yes, I'm Elizabeth. It's really nice to hear from you."</p> <p>"So, what's up in the resort? How are you making out?"</p> <p>"You get the impression I don't come up to it on a regular basis," Elizabeth retorted. "Besides, I guess you don't like me talking with another woman."</p> <p>"What do you mean? Are you still with the group?"</p> <p>"You know better than that, Samantha. If I was a girl, I'd go to the resort with you!"</p> <p>Samantha laughed. "Of course not! But, you've got to be kidding me. There are no other women at the resort, right? No group sex, no boyfriend?"</p> <p>"No, there not," Elizabeth replied. "The resort is a sex resort, and so are the women in it. The resort is not a place for sex, because if you go there with a guy, you leave a message for me to let you know. You just have to bring my cell phone to the phone booth."</p> <p>Samantha laughed again, shaking her head. "No, I don't have anyone to bring to the place. Why? Why don't you let the man at the phone booth know that this woman you're talking about wants a sexual relationship with you?"</p> <p>"Oh, he certainly knows!" thought Elizabeth. "Besides, he has to be in his room by now anyway."</p> <p>"But I just met him, so I will have to make do. I know you've got your cell phone, and I'm the only woman for you, so go to the phone booth and meet him before he does, I don't want him to know you're there to talk."</p> <p>"Okay, that might be a little difficult," Elizabeth thought, "But I'm sure no one will find out that I'm here with a guy that I'm not allowed to have sex with." So, she decided, she would call the resort's security office.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Elizabeth was feeling horny again, when she got to the island early Thursday afternoon. She was going to walk across the parking lot again, and that suited her too. As she approached the pool, she saw Samantha standing in the pool.</p> <p>"What do you think of the view?" Elizabeth said, stepping into the pool.</p> <p>"It's stunning," Samantha replied. "The sun is shining, and it's perfect for sunbathing. You must be a very beautiful woman if you can enjoy swimming in here."</p> <p>Without thinking, Elizabeth replied, "I do. That was beautiful."</p> <p>"And I'm happy to see you," Samantha said with a smile.</p> <p>"I know you do," Elizabeth replied, getting out of the pool. "Where should we get dressed?"</p> <p>"That's where you and your friends are going, and you don't have to wear a bikini with my friends here in the pool. If they get any ideas, then they're going to have to go outside to get things ready."</p> <p>"And what makes you think we would go outside and get ready in the nude?"</p> <p>Sam laughed. "Because I saw you naked a couple of minutes agoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
