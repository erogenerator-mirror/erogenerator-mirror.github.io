"I'm not the best judge of character when it comes to lovemaking, Daddy, although I can tell by your expression that your penis was the biggest thing in the world and he shot off that much. And, of course, when we made love, my pussy felt as if it had just been filled with a fucking rubber cock, not real big-cock."</p> <p>This time, the question came in my head. "Did you and the guy you were fucking, Mom, do the same fucking?" I said.</p> <p>"Well, no, we didn't," she said. I looked over at my hard cock in her hand again. She could never get it inside her, that thing was too long for her to put on hold with one hand.</p> <p>"Well, I guess I can live with that," I said. "But it won't happen again, will it?"</p> <p>"It won't," she said.</p> <p>Then her words were like a ton of ice melting down an ice storm on my brain. "But...you know," I said, "I don't think I'm in love with any of this. I was going to suggest to Mom that I get a divorce, and she'd just say, 'Why?', but I just changed my mind. I mean, you and Dad haven't been married for years - never mind," I said.</p> <p>"That's all right," she said. Then she looked at the clock. "We're almost at lunchtime. Want to go get a bite to eat before work tomorrow?"</p> <p>I did so, and we got back into the car. As we drove to the restaurant, Dawn was holding my hand all the way, even when I pulled over into one of the driveways and parked.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're feeling better," I said. "I felt like I was falling asleep. And, you know, I think I just needed to give myself some time to reflect...I think I can put up with this."</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said. "But at least I felt good...and I hope you do too, Daddy." She squeezed my hand and gave me a little peck on the cheek. "I mean, that's all this," she said. "I mean, maybe it would be weird for you to take me home and fuck me and make love to me and then go back to me, like you had before. But, well, I'm just glad I could talk with you about how you felt."</p> <p>"Mom, this was all so new for me," I said.</p> <p>"I know, Daddy," she said. "I just wanted to do something for you at the same time. I've told you before - every man has his needs, and all women do the same. Sometimes a woman is best and sometimes just not."</p> <p>"But, Mom, you've never given me an option to have sex..."</p> <p>"You may never have sex again, Daddy," she said. She looked at her watch. "When we have dinner, I want to ask you a question. Do you think I'm some woman you've been with?"</p> <p>"I don't think you have to ask," I said.</p> <p>She nodded her head slowly.</p> <p>"When you're with me..." I said. "That's nice. I like to think..."</p> <p>"Daddy," she said. "I was raised to be a good girl. That means you have to keep it together. If you don't, I might be the one who will go through with this. Not to get pregnant again..."</p> <p>"Thanks, Mom," I said. "But, no, I'm not going to try and keep it quiet." I looked at the clock again. "I'll tell you what. I'll drive you on home after you get cleaned up and ready, okay?"</p> <p>She nodded her head.</p> <p>"It won't be your father," I said. "His cock won't be in your wife's pussy yet, either."</p> <p>"I think it's all right," she said. "I just can't see my Dad with a little prick." Then she turned back to me. "You don't have any idea how big Daddy's cock is," she said. "Not that you have to know, though, because I'm sure you're already knowing." She started talking so softly I was certain that she must not have been whispering. "It's long and wide, like it always is, really thick and fat. You'll love it - you can't imagine how good it would feel with all that fat hanging out. And," she paused and looked back at me, "I want you to know, Daddy, I know you are so well equipped, and I know you are as horny as I am.
