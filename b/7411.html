I asked.</p> <p>Jack's hands were still on his hips as he struggled to get his shirt off. And he was shaking again. I stood on my knees beside the bed and moved around to the other side. Jack didn't know what to do. He wasn't trying to cover himself or move at all. I pulled his hands away from his head.</p> <p>"Not so fast, Jack," I said. "You have a history with these sorts of questions, you know." I gave him a stern look and took his hands away. "I'm not going to fuck you, Jack. I think we're both still a bit too wrapped up in our relationship to be doing that. I want to make sure that you're enjoying it." I sat down on the bed and sat right alongside him. "Don't worry about asking questions," I told him. "Remember when we first started going out, remember it. It's more of a 'one-time thing.' " I sat a little closer to him and wrapped my arm around him. "That's it. Just tell me what makes you so happy," I said as I slipped my hand behind his neck. "That's it," I said as I kissed his ear. "When I think about it, Jack, I wish I was still your first boyfriend. That way it would never feel as if any of us had gotten together at all. And I think I'm going to live with you until your parents get back with the papers. " I put my other hand on his crotch and gave it a squeeze as I moved away. "I like this," I said, "a lot." I leaned forward and kissed Jack again, pressing my body to his. My hand slid further down his chest, to his belly, and further. I could feel the lump in his pants, and it wasn't a full erection. It was still big enough that he would have to hold at least one of his own when I slid my hand under his underwear and pressed it forward against his balls.</p> <p>"Oh my," moaned Jack as my hand made contact with the soft flesh of his shaft. "Oh, God, Beth. That feels so good," he stammered. I smiled and lifted myself up on my hands and knees and slowly slid my hand up his stomach, to his chest, and down to his cock, which was now fully, and fully erect. It had been a long time since I had felt something so alive. He was so hard it looked painful. I knew that I would not be able to do anything about it after all it looked as good as it felt.</p> <p>I bent down and kissed the tip of his cock, right at the bottom, before putting my mouth over the head. I slid my lips slowly down the shaft and he was already leaking precum down into my mouth, which I put off with a quick flick of my tongue around the head. The salty flavor of it sent tingles down my spine and down my legs. I began to make little love noises around the head of his cock as it entered my mouth. The vibrations sent sparks through my body and I heard Jack let out a slight hiss. I took his cock out of my mouth and ran it up and down his shaft teasing the head. Then I put it back into my mouth, and down again a little more. I took more and more out of his mouth until he stopped talking and just kept his eyes closed. Each time another inch or so cleared his head, his eyes opened again. Slowly, I got him back into my mouth and began taking him. As I did, I could feel his cock slide deeper into my mouth, and I knew he was about to shoot his load. I slid my lips back down his shaft, and he was shooting his load into my mouth. He had stopped talking and was just breathing hard. His eyes were still closed, I was sure he wouldn't move for fear of losing control of his self-control. Then I felt his cum flow down my throat. It was warm and tangy, with a tangy flavor I couldn't explain. I loved that feeling.</p> <p>I stood up and kissed him hard. "I don't want to be your first, Jack. It will be so much better if we can stop there. I don't think it would be fair to keep you from enjoying this experience and to get some more pleasure, when I've come to get you back for something so that you'll never forget." It was true that I had enjoyed the experience, and I was very proud of my self-control. I could have taken a few quick peeks to see if he was okay, but I'd already made a decision, so I had other matters on my mind. "I think I want to have a quickie," I said, "with you still hard inside of me."</p> <p>Jack looked confused and then smiled broadlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
