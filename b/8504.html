"I think the baby is ready, my love!"</p> <p>"It's gonna be a surprise!"</p> <p>We kissed deeply again for several minutes, her arms tight around my neck in a loving embrace, before she said, "Okay, so we're here! And I want you to do the following: I hope you're ready for me to go to the nursery in the morning, and I'll spend the whole weekend just being you!" I grinned ear-to-ear, and she hugged me so tight I began to worry we'd never make it.</p> <p>"Honey, what are you doing?" she asked. "You're already doing my favorite thing. So if it's going to be like that baby," she added with a grin, she leaned in to look into my eyes, and added just slightly more of her own to my cheeks: "I want to show you how wonderful you are! I want to be a daddy!" With that, she gently disengaged herself from me, turned and looked at me, a questioning expression on her pretty face.</p> <p>"Is that what you're looking for, then?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" I said proudly, "I want to be a daddy too, and I want to be in charge!"</p> <p>"Well, there's one more thing before we do it. I want to bring you down to see the baby!"</p> <p>"I'll be happy to see it!"</p> <p>She giggled and came forward and gave me a kiss, and another, and another, until I came to a few more minutes later, and we were all kissing like old friends, as we waited to get in the nursery together in the morning.</p> <p>We had to wait until dusk, the night before, in order to see the young baby - the one who had been conceived in the morning, and whose parents had just left for England at the end of the month - the first morning of the next day, the day after the birth, and after the child's birthday. We all just stayed awake, happy and smiling and holding hands, until the baby was born, and then started putting on the dresses - our dresses, hers, and hers.</p> <p>"Honey! You look amazing!" I said when she came down to hug me.</p> <p>"Thanks! My dress is just perfect."</p> <p>"Mine too! This is so nice!" We both smiled and hugged.</p> <p>When we made our way back to the bedroom, I looked at her, and could see the excitement in her eyes, and a look of concern cross her face.</p> <p>"You feel so good," she said. Her look was one of affection and respect.</p> <p>"I love you, too, Marla!" We kissed again, as we lay together on the bed together, still in our pajamas.</p> <p>"And don't think for one second I'll say something foolish or silly," I warned her.</p> <p>"I know you won't!"</p> <p>We kissed again, and then she rolled over and hugged me.</p> <p>"I love you, so very much," she said, giving me a shy look.</p> <p>"Do you feel the same, right now?"</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she said again, sounding as if she wanted to say it aloud, even for herself. "I feel so loved that I can say it without words, like I'm saying it to myself."</p> <p>She was quiet for a long time, and then she looked at me and said, "I was surprised how much you loved me. I knew you felt the same way!"</p> <p>"You felt the same way," I agreed, as we hugged and kissed again.</p> <p>"I was just waiting for some reason to start - to ask you to love me, in a different way - when we were both here together. When we were in the same room that night - we're like friends that way for the first time - it was even harder to stay in the same room with you." She paused and then added, "But the first night, you were much more intense in your lovemaking than in that bathroom. You got very wet, and were more intense, too!"</p> <p>"It was like sex with someone else!" I added - her response was a little less definite than I'd originally intended, but I hoped so!</p> <p>"Yeah, well! So it was good! And you're right. It was pretty intense. But, no, I don't feel better about this. Let's just try and go with the feeling as we come down from our orgasms, okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
