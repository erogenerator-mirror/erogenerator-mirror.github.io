My cock was now rock hard and I was still throbbing from my orgasm.</p> <p>She looked and smiled at me. "I've been thinking about that ever since I got home."</p> <p>"So have I... and I want you to cum for me."</p> <p>That was very hot and I wasn't going to argue.</p> <p>I rolled over first, laying between her legs. I put my arms on her waist, running my hands up and down her body. She reached down and put her fingers in her wet pussy and started to rub it.</p> <p>"Wow! You're wet. I haven't even touched your pussy."</p> <p>"Yeah, you can get wet anytime. Just let your self go, and then you'll feel better."</p> <p>A smile crossed my face. I didn't really think she'd just said that.</p> <p>"Mmmm. I can't wait! I'll just let you cum for me soon... and you can be sure to let me cum for you anytime."</p> <p>"I want to cum for you. Just let me do everything for you."</p> <p>"Ok. Let me get up on the bed. It feels so hot and heavy between my legs."</p> <p>"Don't you cum until I do."</p> <p>We both laughed.</p> <p>I got between her legs then grabbed my cock and started rubbing it over her clit. She wrapped her legs around me as I did this and I was starting to breathe heavier.</p> <p>"I want you to cum for me now!" I told her.</p> <p>I rubbed it a little harder and she moaned in approval.</p> <p>I did it, holding back for a bit for a bit so I could feel her reaction.</p> <p>"OH MY GOD!! I'm SO CLOSE!" she shouted.</p> <p>I stopped rubbing her clit and she moaned again.</p> <p>"OH GOD! I'm cumming! Oh God, I'm cumming for you! Oh, Oh, God!"</p> <p>My cock exploded in her pussy and it triggered something else as she started cumming on my cock.</p> <p>"Oh God! I'm cumming again! Oh God! I'm cumming!" she cried out.</p> <p>I slowed my stroking as I was about to cum and then I pulled out and let her legs go. She lay there panting and trying to recover from the orgasm she just experienced.</p> <p>"Oh, that felt so good."</p> <p>"Yeah. It was so hot. When we fucked before, I couldn't wait to do it again."</p> <p>"So were you?"</p> <p>"Yeah... and it felt so good to me too."</p> <p>"You're so sexy!"</p> <p>"And you're such a hot girl... so sexy."</p> <p>I started to get up from the bed and she stopped me.</p> <p>"I'm in a bathroom."</p> <p>"Yeah, you're right, I'm in a bathroom. Come on."</p> <p>I got up and she quickly went to the bathroom, closing the door behind her. I went to my own bathroom to get cleaned up. As I was thinking about what just happened, she came into the bathroom. "Well? What did you think?"</p> <p>"That's pretty hot. I've been thinking the same thing ever since I started touching your pussy ever since that first time we had it. I want more."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Seriously though, maybe you'll be surprised as to how much you like it when I give you a blowjob after you cum."</p> <p>"I'm going to have to think about that."</p> <p>"Let me see if I can find what I want for lunch..."</p> <p>"Ok. I'll call you after we eat. I'll text you so you won't be worried."</p> <p>She was done with her lunch and I went back into the bathroom to clean up the mess as I went by the bathroom to do my toiletries. I did some of the washing up for the moment and then returned and sat down on the other side of the tub to wash up.</p> <p>"So what brings you here so early today?"</p> <p>"I told you I didn't have a lot to do today. I went a little crazy last week with the party, but everything went well."</p> <p>"Well, I can tell. I think you did a pretty good job with it. So what brings you here this afternoon?"</p> <p>It took a lot for her to catch onto the last part. She seemed very nervous, but the look on her face was one of concern as well. "Well, you know that I really liked your idea of the party and the clothes..."</p> <p>I got interrupted by this and she quickly looked at meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
