A note was inside the door, it had told him that he was invited to the club and that he should look out for him and he had done so.</p> <p>He'd thought, 'what the heck, how much did she need to know,' it would be hard to get into a conversation with her brother when she was already eighteen, but he managed.</p> <p>He'd dressed for the occasion at the club. It was the same one he'd stayed at the first time Amy had shown up, it was in a dark corner and the sound of running water was still audible outside.</p> <p>She'd stood for a moment in the doorway, watching him. She was about to ask him why he hadn't joined her at the club, but he'd already been introduced and he'd gone back to his table.</p> <p>He'd felt slightly stupid for not making it a second date, a night after the first, a second time, but the last few days had been the best, they'd been closer in so many ways and he'd not lost any of it over the years. Not now though. He was on a mission. She'd been a long time, but a few months ago he'd started going home with his girlfriends, one night they were together and he'd gone home and got himself off.</p> <p>She had been shocked and not too happy. But that was to come later. He found her sitting on his bar stool with him and just sat there, looking at him.</p> <p>The look in her eyes had brought him up short, the look in hers had been real; she seemed to have been affected by him, maybe it was just that he was so young, maybe she really enjoyed him and it had only made her feel really happy to be a part of their relationship.</p> <p>She'd looked away from him, "I'm only seventeen!" she had said, "No, I'm only seventeen!"</p> <p>John had found himself having to agree with her words, though it wasn't exactly his opinion, perhaps she was older? And he hadn't actually been expecting it after all. She'd kept staring at him, "When will you be home?"</p> <p>"Soon!" he'd replied.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Amy had been waiting outside the club. The girl in the window, and the one in his arms had just left, he'd asked her to help him find her house.</p> <p>His thoughts were on her, of how nice it was to stay so close, how much she hadn't grown up, how much she appreciated his company, what an attractive young thing she turned out to be, who was there with him, who knew him and what he could do to ease some old, lonely old pains up.</p> <p>He'd wanted to fuck her, he was in love with her and he loved her more than ever. She'd come back to him, and he was sure that the more he thought about it the more he'd started to love her.</p> <p>But it was over, he'd packed, they were going home and to his house.</p> <p>He hadn't looked back at her, but she wouldn't have been happy with that. And he'd tried hard to make her feel at home in a way that she actually enjoyed, as he took her home, he was always careful as a parent.</p> <p>But the girl in the window had just left him standing there, he was getting a bit overwhelmed by the thought that it was only a moment later that Amy had followed him home, she'd followed him home.</p> <p>Amy was feeling the same way, that much was clear.</p> <p>They hadn't talked, what they had said, or what they had done with each other, they'd just kissed as one. No words were needed between them. And that was it. That wasn't the kind of kiss that could ever lead to real affection between two people that had metâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
