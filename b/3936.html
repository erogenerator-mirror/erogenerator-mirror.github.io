He had been right. I guess this was the time to let up. "It was good," I said, my hand sliding up the side of the tub as the water rose up to my chin.</p> <p>"You like it?" The man said as he pulled me in for a gentle kiss. Not the kind of kiss that could be mistaken for a peck. It could be described as a loving kiss, with one of those perfect little kisses that only a lover could give you with, and which I had been dying to do. This was where they made love. It couldn't be mistaken for a kiss just for a sex or romance act.</p> <p>I wanted so badly to kiss that man, on his couch, and make love to him.</p> <p>"It's alright," he said. "I like you, but that doesn't mean I like you."</p> <p>"I'm not sure what you are thinking, but if you really don't care about your reputation or what I might be doing, give me a call and I'll tell you. Just let me know when and where and I'll even pick up a cab."</p> <p>The words had made me so happy to hear from him. I hadn't been that happy in many years, but they were what I needed to hear and what I needed to feel for my future self. "If we're going to do that, then let's do it now," he said.</p> <p>He washed his hands off and I stepped out of the tub. He dried his hands off and started drying mine. His hands felt so good on my skin. With a smile, I walked toward him and wrapped my arms around his neck. He gave me the same kiss I was expecting. My hands slipped behind his head and our tongues twirled as our hands explored each other. We kissed again, but this time, he was much gentler. He kissed me gently as he washed my face, then pressed his body tightly against mine. I ran my hand through his hair and squeezed his head.</p> <p>My hands went to his chest and he cupped my breasts. When they started feeling my nipples through the cloth of my shirt, I let my hands caress his chest. He smiled and turned me toward him. He gave my breasts a quick kiss and then stepped back from me. "You can shower now," he said as he grabbed the towel from behind him.</p> <p>I smiled and nodded.</p> <p>He dried off quickly and wrapped the towel around his waist. He turned away as I walked into the bedroom. I felt his hands as he went to get the shower. He was quick, but he caught my body and spun me so I was facing him.</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around me and held me close to him, as his body molded itself to mine. "I'm so glad to have you," he said as he held me to him. "But you're all I have. If we weren't going to be lovers, you'd be all I'll ever want."</p> <p>We laughed. We hadn't said more than that to each other in a long time.</p> <p>As he dried himself, he stopped and looked at me. "It didn't seem right," he said. "I know. But it's okay."</p> <p>"But what about everything else?"</p> <p>"I'm free after this weekend and that's all I'll have," he said as he wrapped his arms around my waist.</p> <p>"I don't get it," I said in a surprised voice.</p> <p>"You don't know what that means," he said as he started kissing my neck. "All you have now is what it means to me. And if I do, I won't get what you want to know until I see how that all works out."</p> <p>He took the towel off and wrapped it around me again, covering me from my neck to the waistband of my pants. After he wrapped me up in the towel once more, he stepped back in front of me. I felt his hands on my hips and his lips to my neck again. He kissed me and made slow love to me with slow, sensual kisses. The water ran down my face as I felt his lips on my neck, nibbling on my skin. He teased his lips to me as his hands dropped lower to cup the cheeks of my ass. I moaned and spread my legs, allowing him to come closer to me.</p> <p>He continued kissing me as his hands slid up my inner thighs and across my pussy. He rubbed along the lips of my vagina and dipped a finger inside of me, gently tracing from the bottom of the hood of my clit to the back of my vagina. He let my legs go. I was so wet that a finger easily slid all up inside of me. Then he moved one finger to the wet tip of his cock and held it, waiting for me to turn around.
