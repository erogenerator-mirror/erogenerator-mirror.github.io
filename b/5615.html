I sat down and she sat down too. I sat on her lap, leaned forward, and kissed her. I held her face in my hands and felt her body relax under my touch.</p> <p>"That was really nice," she said.</p> <p>"It's good to see you again," she laughed.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said. "I had an erection the whole night, and you were here with me."</p> <p>"You just caught me off guard."</p> <p>"I'd hate to be the cause of that," she joked. "That's one of the perks of being here that you don't know. Maybe next time."</p> <p>"Next time?" I questioned.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Next time I want you to fuck me again," I said.</p> <p>"What?" she asked.</p> <p>"I want to see the pictures for a few days."</p> <p>"I don't have any."</p> <p>"Just a few pictures, we'll see about that. The next time is only a few hours from now."</p> <p>I thought about doing just that but there were already a lot of people there. I got up and made my way to the door.</p> <p>"The pictures were nice though," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," she replied. "That was so hot. I'd be happy to do that."</p> <p>She held me, and gave me a kiss then. I turned to lock the door and she grabbed my ass, not that I would have denied it otherwise. We broke the kiss, and she laughed.</p> <p>"Let's get a cup of coffee, I've got more to add."</p> <p>She led me back to the study, and stood on the couch. She lay down on her back, propped up a pillow in front of her and she spread her legs. I knelt between them and took her hands and placed them on her.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she said.</p> <p>I crawled over her body, put on my body on hers, and pressed a thumb into her as I leaned down. I heard her sigh as I pressed my cock into her slit. I slowly worked it up and down, letting both of us feel the length of me as it traveled up and down her.</p> <p>"Damn girl, you are so fucking sexy," I complimented her.</p> <p>"You make me feel wonderful," she replied, "and I love the way you fuck me."</p> <p>I fucked her slowly for a while, I was getting close, and I needed to get off soon as well. I had no idea that there was so much of me left over, but I didn't care, nor did I have anything else left. My cock throbbed continuously as it throbbed in and out of her, it seemed like forever since I last had sex with an incredibly gorgeous woman. We talked over coffee, I did some more touching before we got back into our clothes, and finally dressed.</p> <p>"Thanks Ms. S.," she said after we got dressed. "That was really nice. That was really hot. How about you?"</p> <p>"Well, yeah, I guess I needed that."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>She gave me a quick hug.</p> <p>"I think you should go. I'll call you tomorrow for the details."</p> <p>"I wouldn't take no for an answer."</p> <p>"No. I'll be in touch."</p> <p>I got home about seven, and went in my new home office. I locked the door and checked in. I logged into my computer and started a new e-mail. The woman at TechNet came home one hour later.</p> <p>"Welcome to our humble home," I said.</p> <p>She looked up at me and replied, "Hello David,"</p> <p>When she got my e-mail she left it open, but chose not to read it. Instead, she reached out and touched it and started to read.</p> <p>"How about next Saturday? Your meeting will be over in fifteen minutes..."</p> <p>To give you more incentive you may want to add one more comment, but I'm definitely more interested in the stories at Literotica than in reading stories at my home office.</p> <p>We met in person on Friday night, I'm sure. She looked like she needed to be naked, but I didn't feel like it. We made love, it was really nice, and I enjoyed watching her. We had sex in all sorts of places and she was awesome when it was with me. But we could do this over and over when we had all night. Not just do it over and over, but I can't seem to get enough.</p> <p>You see, I'm starting work Monday and getting my computer started at five o'clock. I have to be there to sign up and getâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
