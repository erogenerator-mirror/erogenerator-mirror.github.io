I was just going to have a shower." she said, "My pussy is dry."</p> <p>"Oh, sorry." I replied, "I was just trying to wash myself."</p> <p>"Sorry?" She asked, not really knowing what I was getting at.</p> <p>"Your pussy is like no-one I've ever had before." I replied, "So I'll take the blame.</p> <p>"So do go shower, before I change my mind and do it in the shower!" she said, "I'll be in shortly."</p> <p>I let her pass by. I turned on the water and stepped in. I got in and closed the shower curtain. I turned to face her and she was in front of me. She saw that my cock was standing at full mast and that it was making a massive tent with the way I was sitting and the way my eyes were closed. She looked up at me and smiled, "I told you the showers are hot."</p> <p>"No... I mean, what do you think I meant?" I asked, "Well... it looks like I need them to wash me too."</p> <p>"Uh-huh, I can see there's something going on with you!" she said, "Just wait till you see the shower!"</p> <p>She started the shower and I took advantage of it and put it on so it would last longer. Once the water was ready to run, I stripped. She took two steps over to me and started to stroke my cock. I turned my head to her and she took my chin in her hands and kissed me. I felt her breath on my cheek and opened my mouth slightly and met her lips with my tongue. I felt her lips press on mine and she parted her lips and met my tongue with hers. She broke the kiss briefly and said, "Mmmm, you taste so good." and kissed back a bit more passionately. I felt her hand on my cock as she stroked it slowly, then she ran her thumb over the head a few times, before she licked it again. A small involuntary moan was all that came out of my lips. I ran my hands slowly over her back and breasts, pulling and playing with her nipples. Both of us were breathing heavily. I broke the kiss and kissed her neck to the top of her chest. She shivered slightly and I could tell from the expression on her face that she wouldn't be able to withstand another. I kissed her chin, then her jaw, then down her neck. I moved onto her breasts; she took hold of the sides and pulled herself up so she was on her knees, which I was now kneeling in front of her. I knelt again and took each nipple in my mouth and flicked my tongue over them. She was moaning loudly now, so I knew I had made the right choice. I pulled her breasts away from her body but she just raised one to my mouth and I did the same to the other one. We were at it again and she was shaking all over.</p> <p>I took both hands and reached around her and slipped them lower. I found her pussy and dipped a finger around it. The feeling I felt sent a wave of pleasure through her body. With my index finger, I began to spread her outer pussy lips. She lifted the hood of her clit with her index finger and I began to rub my thumb back and forth over it. Her hands were all over me now. She was moaning, "Oh!.... OH!.... Oh.... Oh!" and I could only hear the sound as she pushed her pussy into my hand.</p> <p>Finally she came down and we were still kissing. "Ooh. That was nice. Did you want to take off my shirt?"</p> <p>"No... I don't think so. Maybe I should just do it myself... before I change my mind."</p> <p>She opened the shower door and stepped back. "Well, that sounds nice..." she said, "So how about I take you out to dinner and you wash me again for dinner?" She grinned and stepped out of the shower.</p> <p>"You can't just put on clothes and have fun, can you." I said as I was drying my hair. She grinned. "What would you do, if I didn't do it myself?"</p> <p>"Well," I said. "You could do it."</p> <p>"I think I'd like to. You know, as much as you can think, after I wash." she said with a grin, I felt like I just did all the walking. I walked to the mirror and turned my head towards her. I took off my towel and pulled it on. While doing so, I couldn't resist running my hands over her breasts. "So... you do really... um... do it... with... us...?" I asked. She shook her head, "Uh, no... no, I don't do itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
