I've seen a lot you've seen."</p> <p>"No, you've not, actually."</p> <p>"I hope you can see it."</p> <p>"I hope I can do better than that."</p> <p>"What's that supposed mean?" I said with a laugh. "I don't know you well enough, you need a woman that you can be yourself with."</p> <p>"I have needs, I guess. I have to tell you that that is not entirely my goal. I have to tell you that I'm trying. I don't have to let anyone else see me nude. I'm not letting you get all the women you want."</p> <p>"You don't have to be happy."</p> <p>"No, I don't feel like I'm happy until I'm looking at a naked female."</p> <p>"I can do that."</p> <p>"Okay. How about when everyone sees you naked?"</p> <p>"I guess that's more about being naked than it is about being embarrassed."</p> <p>"Right. Let's see, I thought you didn't look at me when we were in the shower, so I didn't really look."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>"Don't worry, I was watching what I did. Okay?"</p> <p>"Sure. Do that again."</p> <p>We stood there, facing each other. We looked at each other's faces, trying to get a reaction. After a long moment, Amanda stood up.</p> <p>"Let's get you naked too."</p> <p>She grabbed my hand and led me to the tub, sliding right in. She turned around and put her hands on the wall, putting herself completely at eye level. We were standing in the tub facing each other. Our bodies were touching. Amanda reached down and grabbed the lather of soap in her hands as she started rubbing it all over my body. I had a hard time taking it in, it felt so good so right. Before I realized what was happening she had my cock out of my fly and had my semi-erect cock sticking out straight in front of her face. I was about to try and get into that when she stopped.</p> <p>"I've never done this before," Amanda said. "Let's just pretend."</p> <p>"Okay," I said nervously.</p> <p>My cock is not that big and Amanda is not as tiny as her friend in the video. This is the first time I've seen a female naked. She had the same body shape, with the same breasts. I guess I still like girls, just don't expect to find all that much of an attraction. The video did wonders on me.</p> <p>"You really don't like me, do you?" Amanda asked.</p> <p>"No, I don't know, but I'd like to see more. So, I guess I'm just going to have to do this for a little while."</p> <p>"That's fine. I'll be right back." Amanda grabbed the lather, but I didn't have time to take it. I had my back to her, facing her, as she got on her hands and knees, and started rubbing the soap up and down her legs. She turned around to start with my back, washing my back. She was so slow and deliberate that I didn't even have time to get over an erection as we worked together.</p> <p>Amanda's hands were doing a beautiful job of washing my body. She had to be at least five feet two inches tall, but I'd guess she had to weigh a few hundred pounds. She ran her finger tips up and down my chest and down my sides. When she reached the head of my cock, she slowly moved her hands all the way down to the base. When she reached the end of my shaft, she kept them going.</p> <p>"Mmmm. You are very well washed, Andy," Amanda said.</p> <p>The look of pure adoration in her eyes was enough to start my erection to come out. Amanda took hold of my rock hard cock and slowly worked it through the lather of her hands.</p> <p>"Why don't you put this thing in your mouth," Amanda said to me.</p> <p>I took the first step and started to pull away. Amanda quickly grabbed my arm, pulling me to her. She quickly turned towards the door, putting her arms around my neck and kissing me on the lips. The kiss was long and slow, almost passionate. Amanda looked into my eyes as I kissed her gently, then started slowly working her way down my body. Amanda's hands worked the washcloth over my chest and across my stomach, then she went lower and started to lick and kiss the length of my cock.
