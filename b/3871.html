She put her fingers in her mouth, licked them, and then ran them over her lips, wiping them onto my shirt collar.</p> <p>"You've got such nice eyes and such a nice, well-developed nose," she drawled, but I wasn't fooled. Instead, I took in the way her nipples jutted proudly from her chest - just a hint - and then I lifted them with my thumbs until they were erect. They were like rocks - not really hard and full, but they were still standing firmly and tall - and they were in a state of arousal all on their own. I squeezed them gently to test if I could make them feel real, while also keeping my eyes on hers. "They're not that small, they're like... big dangly things. I can tell from your skin underneath my fingers that you have an incredible skin-toned figure. Do you keep yourself in shape?"</p> <p>"Oh, I did," I replied, "not nearly as much as I used to - I could always take it off and..."</p> <p>"That would be too embarrassing if you knew how turned on I get."</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you're being nice," I replied, with a smile. "I kind of want to get to know you better. How about we make love right here on the bed - that's right, there." She smiled and raised her eyebrows. "Come on then." I pulled her into my arms a little more forcefully and we got on the bed and I laid her on her back. She didn't seem to mind, not that she was looking at the ceiling. She had her eyes closed, and her breath came in sharp short bursts. She raised her hands, placing them on my bare chest, and it was a moment before I was able to touch her again.</p> <p>I kissed her lips softly. I ran my tongue lightly across her bottom lip. She gave a soft moan and opened her mouth slightly. I leaned in again. My tongue was now at the entrance to her mouth, and I slid it inside. She sucked on it slightly as I kissed her again - and then we were kissing again, her breath coming in pants as she drew in my breath through her nose. She drew back on it a bit, and I slid my tongue forward, licking the inside of her mouth for a moment while I fondled her tits with one hand.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she said, "that's nice. You're so gentle with me. I was afraid you'd feel awkward with just my hands." She placed her hands on my chest, pressing upwards on it. It was kind of hard not have my hard, straining dick press into her ass as I kissed her, but I decided it didn't seem like a great time to start. "Hnnn-fuh-fffuck," I said as slowly I pulled away. She got that look about me, the look of confusion. I was going to let her say what she wanted to say anyway, but I got up first and walked over to where the bed was, looking for something, a towel, something to wipe myself - and then I sat down on her, holding her tight to my chest as she squirmed around. I kissed her as I lifted up and we fell into a very passionate embrace. Her body was hot and yielding. I just held on to her body as it molded to mine.</p> <p>"You got me," I heard her whisper as we held each other.</p> <p>I moved back and laid on my back, my head between her breasts, looking as though I was trying to see through the clouds - which, they were, but I couldn't feel them very well, nor did the bed frame. "Well, I don't know why I'm surprised that you're so into me."</p> <p>"I love you so much for saying that," she said, pulling her mouth from mine and sliding up and over my face. I responded as she did - kissing her with lips and tongue - and she was soon pulling back. And before she could, I took one last look at her face as she lay under me, eyes closed and still, smiling, her mouth set slightly open. "You're amazing," she said, and she rolled around to face me and I kissed the side of her face, as she did the same thing to my face - her eyes shut tight and her mouth partially open in an expression of shock as she was about to say something. "Thank you. Can we take this one more day?"</p> <p>"That would be wonderful, absolutely," I replied, looking back at her from behind, sitting just a bit on the bed in front of me - her bottom rising so far, her eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
