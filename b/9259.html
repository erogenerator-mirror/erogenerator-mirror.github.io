It was the one's name was. She looked down at them; he was nude, her lover was a naked male. She blushed, her heart raced and her pulse began to race.</p> <p>Her lover slid to the side and opened her eyes enough to look down at his cock for a moment. It stuck out at a full 8 inches and was large in girth. The thick head, she thought, so big in fact it looked like a mushroom cap. Her hand had automatically wrapped around it as he moved in front of her. And he smiled as it moved over her face, down her neck, over her breasts and back up to her head.</p> <p>The lips were soft, his moved back and forth from her ears to her neck and back once again. She felt his cock moving against her stomach, then his cock, she shivered as it pushed itself to her pussy. It moved over her breasts, the weight felt so good against them. He moved it back and forth between them.</p> <p>"This is nice," he said softly, "I'll never get tired of this."</p> <p>"You're not so bad yourself." She felt his hands slide down over her stomach and onto her pussy. He started to stroke between her lips, then move over her clit. She felt his finger slide down the length of her slit and probe into her pussy hole. She felt his hand slide over her clit and feel on it, and her knees went weak. He slid two fingers in her, she moaned as he did so. He took them right to the bottom and pushed them upwards, she groaned again. He started to finger fuck her, and she felt herself getting wet as he did so. She moaned as she felt his fingers slide to the bottom of her hole, she felt herself stretched just a little and then slowly move upwards as he pushed in. Once inside her there were two fingers, moving in and out as she felt herself get even wetter.</p> <p>"Let me," she moaned as he put one big finger inside her. She loved the feeling that his two fingers inside her made her pussy feel. She wanted it harder, as well. His finger slid into her even deeper, she felt herself fill up and spread along his fingers as they slid in and out slowly. They both felt her pussy as the weight changed, his middle finger sliding further down her crack. She moved her right hand from under her body and grabbed his cock, she felt him slide a little deeper inside her and he started to push in. They both groaned at this.</p> <p>He was going deep inside her, they knew it was going to be difficult to move; and neither of them wanted to let go, both were so far gone it seemed just right. They moaned together at the feeling of being filled and feeling his cock fill her. They loved feeling a cock slide into their cunts, both knowing the sensation was mutual and just the thought that they were both sharing it, just the thought that the other felt.</p> <p>His fingers slid out of her as his cock slipped from her mouth. She closed her eyes again as she felt the cock pressing against her pussy. She could not move. She could not stop her body as her body's desire for him increased. She felt his strong hand holding the other at her left side with strong fingers just barely touching her skin. Their bodies continued to move and move against each other as he stroked her body and his cock slid between her legs. They could feel their bodies, he rubbed his cock around her pussy's entrance and then pressed it against her slit. His cock felt so big, as he slid it back and forth then up to the bottom. She groaned and arched her hips to each push in and to get it farther into her. He held her ass, she felt it, then he pulled her sopping wet pussy into his body and moved his cock back down there in one hard thrust before moving it up. Her pussy enveloped him again as she felt his body thrust against hers. He lowered his body against hers, their bodies were so close both now moved against each other, feeling the desire, the desire of being one, sharing this time, sharing it with each other. She wanted more than anything to feel him inside her, to feel his cock filling her, she wanted him, as she felt him pushing into her, feeling her getting wetter, making her wetter.</p> <p>She felt as if she had died and gone to heaven. Her desire to have that cock inside her and him filling her made her crazy, made her crazy just wanting it, to feel he's cock inside her, her lover being there as much as she just wanted to feel him inside her. He was her lover, she thought, "and lover." She wanted that thing inside her. She felt her lover slideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
