He was surprised to see her smiling as she watched him doing it to her.</p> <p>She hadn't been wearing the blouse he'd been wearing, he figured. "Maybe you shouldn't be so excited at this time, though. Let's just do it from the comfort we have, okay?"</p> <p>"I think..." He heard her say, and then his heart started pounding again. She'd just made her move like she had every night, had set the pace. He was doing it just right.</p> <p>"Good," she replied, "you ready?"</p> <p>"Hell, yes." He leaned back on his arms and she moved up on top of him, her hands coming up to cup his face before she slowly started grinding her hips into him, making a smacking sound as they fucked. He let it go on, moaning and grunting with each little thrust, his hands coming up to caress her ass. They both started breathing faster, just about the same time. Suddenly, they heard a car approaching, and she lifted her hands off as it slowed down. She lifted herself up, leaning over to kiss him, and suddenly the whole car pulled up and sped away. She didn't put her finger on the horn to pull back again, but he could almost feel her body still grinding against him.</p> <p>"That was amazing." She leaned back against his chest, her lips almost touching his chin before she leaned back to kiss him, then started moving her hips up and down the length of him with a little more urgency. He'd never felt better. He didn't know how he'd gotten so wound up, but he was feeling a little bit better still. He had her top in one hand, and was gently caressing her breast with the other. Their mouths met in another long, passionate kiss, her breast pressing against his hand, and he found his hand getting wet again, just from the thought that she could be so willing to do some of that.</p> <p>He started stroking his dick, rubbing the head against her thigh, her legs spread a little farther apart. He was going to ask her to suck his nipple for a little bit, but he couldn't take that right now, and he let her breast fall back to him again, trying not to get his cock head wet.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." She mumbled as she moved her hips, making the friction between them incredible, just as he'd done moments before. "I'm not really used to this. I don't know how to do it..."</p> <p>"Just try it," he replied, taking her hand away. "Maybe you can do better." He slid his hand down to feel her bare pussy, then back up to her breast again, squeezing them both as he did. "If you are good..."</p> <p>He slid one hand under her body, feeling her bare lips, and his hand slid down lower, feeling how wet she was, even if he was still getting her shirt off. It felt so good. He leaned his head back over the steering wheel, and held her breast up with his hand while his fingers teased at the nipple, pulling it up and down in small circles.</p> <p>"I still can't believe you're actually doing this," he said quietly just before he pushed a finger inside her. "You feel amazing."</p> <p>"Not even close." She moaned. "My fingers were too thin, and I was feeling so dirty..." She moved her hips as he pressed against her, and her legs parted slightly as he penetrated her with the other hand. "I was almost as surprised as you were..."</p> <p>"I know, I know." He pulled her down to kiss him again, and felt her body relax against his as he moved his hand up to cup one of her breasts. "The first time was so awkward, and then you gave the whole thing out to me." He started pumping his fingers in her, working them as they moved, and he heard her moan softly. "But this... this feels incredible..."</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me like that again?" He asked.</p> <p>"I don't... really..." She looked at him with that innocent, innocent look. "I don't... I don't know... It feels good..."</p> <p>"Not like fucking you again," he reminded her, "but it's not that I want to fuck you again, I just thought..."</p> <p>"It's just that you're my first," she said simply.</p> <p>"But it's nice to have someone who makes love to you, even if they don't know it himself." He was stroking her, trying to make her feel good, trying to make her forget about her shame and fear.
