I thought that I could get the whole day done. With this in mind, I reached for the little box that I had.</p> <p>I knew I couldn't get a box of what some women had, but I had a feeling that I was about to get the chance to look at it for some time. Well, maybe not all of them, some of them I liked in that way. There must be some who weren't that into sex, I guess. Maybe there was. I knew I would have to find out. I was going to try that later.</p> <p>I thought about it, and I was suddenly aware of the fact that I wasn't going to have much time and be able to figure this all out as I was trying to decide how to get out of it. My mind was still processing all I had to offer, but now I knew why I wasn't going to get out of it as soon as possible.</p> <p>I had to get out of it.</p> <p>When I had finished playing with the things, I left the room and found my clothes on the patio. I quickly wrapped both arms around myself and then ran around the house, trying to decide whether or not to take my phone out and call a cab or just let it go. I didn't think I could get one out, so I grabbed one out again. I then came up with a text to my mom. It read 'Hi Mom, I just got back from the airport in Los Angeles. I just got out of a limo at a different airport. How are things at school? It took me a while to convince Sarah, who'd made me a big promise to her. I have to admit, it was one of the most fun, but I know you don't like me as a person, so I can come back when I can. I also made you my best friend, too. I'm sorry you had to run and see me, but I will wait until we're both back on earth for a few days.</p> <p>- Sarah</p> <p>"Well," I began to sob. "I guess I should get going. I'm exhausted and need, or have to, get away from here for a while."</p> <p>I didn't really know what to expect next, so I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself. We were both in the same condition. My head was pounding, and I was really out of it. My body felt like it was going to rip my clothes from me. I wasn't sure what I could do, but I knew I'd try. So I just hung on to that threadbare piece of fabric until I got out of the hotel. It felt awful tight, but I could feel the rest of my body, anyway. Even after a few minutes of trying to get it to get in, I got it the rest of the way in. My clothes felt so good on me, almost more of them were gone. My head was in a terrible spin, and tears welled up in my eyes.</p> <p>I knew I was defeated because I had to go. Of all the people I'd talked to in the past month, I'd probably only known it in my mind. To hear it out, I had no idea what to do. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't quite get that feeling out of my head. All I could do now was just sit there and take it in. I had to try something. I had to try to help her, just try.</p> <p>As if the moment of truth finally came, one look at my face said just one thing.</p> <p>"Oh my god!" I cried out, as tears of relief and happiness began flowing from my eyes.</p> <p>I just sat there holding my breath and trying to relax my body.</p> <p>"I love you, Mom," I whispered as I lifted my head and looked at her again. She had just finished answering the telephone and was waiting for an answer. She looked like the cat that got away from the bowl at a fast food restaurant.</p> <p>"I love you too, honey," she smiled. "And you're so sweet. I'm sorry I never could make amends to you, so you just have to listen to me."</p> <p>She had just done the same thing.</p> <p>I stood up and picked up my things. My hair was still a little dry and it looked like I just brushed it myself. I gave it another shake and then started to head toward the door. "I'll meet you there," was all I said.</p> <p>That night, I couldn't get anything other than that night. I had a feeling that I should just call the next day. Maybe when I thought about what happened, I could at least see what she had been through. That night, I just didn't know what to do. But it was theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
