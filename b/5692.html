I reached inside my bed to find my underwear still in the floor. I fumed over them and tried to remove them. That proved futile as there was no way of retrieving any of them with the front of them in sight. I decided to leave them behind and instead I took off my dress. I lay back on the bed and began to stroke my breasts and my clitoris as I watched in the mirror. The sight of myself masturbating in the mirror before me like a porn flick, my fingers massaging my clitoris, my heart pounding hard inside my chest ... my whole body shaking all over ... and my mouth opening and closing as I became more and more aroused.</p> <p>I could see myself getting wetter and wetter as I masturbated and I could see how beautiful that was to me, my pussy slick with sweat. I was becoming more and more aroused as time went on - becoming more aware of the situation and how it was affecting me, as well as my self control. When I felt myself getting close to an orgasm I moved to face the mirror and, knowing that I didn't want to masturbate without removing my dress, I took my own dress off. I placed my hand on my stomach and began to rub my belly and chest as I turned away from the mirror and moved closer to it. I didn't remove my bra - I just moved it so I could see my breasts and nipple and that excited me even more! I began to get really turned on as I watched myself masturbate as I stroked my stomach - running my finger over my belly-button and along the cleft under it. With each hand I was getting closer - to my pussy.</p> <p>As I neared my orgasm again I slipped my right hand down my body, underneath the soft fabric of my silk pyjama shorts that were so thin they barely covered my pussy.</p> <p>Suddenly one of the panties began to tear. I thought it would never go through and so I had to stop it. The sensation was so exquisite but it soon gave way to the embarrassment of pulling the underwear away from me in a public place, knowing men might be looking ... but the reality of it made this so much better too.</p> <p>I put my left hand on my back and pushed the panties into the back of my pyjama pants while rubbing the back side of my stomach, feeling a little guilty, my mind filled with shame at the sight of myself so near to a man. I had never masturbated in public before and it felt so lewdly naughty. I pulled the wet underwear from my hands and began to touch my clit. I was still a bit nervous, I wasn't sure if I should masturbate in public - as it was very risky - but, as it was now, I just wanted this to be as far from sexual and as much as my body would allow. I continued to rub myself like this while watching myself in the mirror. I loved to watch myself in the mirror as I worked myself, I always found my eyes were looking at what I did (or did not do), how I looked and how excited I was about myself. I was getting so aroused! My hands were flying across my stomach and breasts and my body was shaking all over and I had only to touch myself a few times to get myself over the edge.</p> <p>At last the waves of orgasm subsided and the breathing returned to normal but when I looked back in the mirror I saw that the back of the panties was a huge rip. I couldn't tell if it looked like a boy or a girl with a wet patch growing into the middle of the duvet. Then, with shock at what I had done, I felt a surge of guilt and a bit of self judgement. Perhaps I should have done that, I thought. But why hadn't I acted? I had seen this man's erection and I wasn't ready to have that. What about the whole scenario in real life - was I too good a teacher? What if I failed? What if someone found out? What if someone saw me again? How would this affect my career and our relationship ... my career? But then I had to try a bit harder to get over the shock and embarrassment of what it had done to me. How could I do that if nothing more than to get it into my own mind ... or even in front of people who knew me the same way?</p> <p>And to my self image - I had a huge wet patch on the back of my pyjama shorts! Maybe that was because the fact that it had so inflamed me so much was the whole reason. But I had to talk it out with someone - so I took off my panties and moved on to the floor as I lay on my back on my bed. I had to try something now and, as I sat thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
