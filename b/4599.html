The door to our left opened up onto one of the many windows that overlooked the backyard, allowing us to see down into the backyard, in and out of the backyard.</p> <p>I turned to her and grinned. "I'd like some help with the groceries," I said. "They seem to be gone."</p> <p>"I'll put everything away, then," she said, then smiled, as she stepped behind me. "I'm home!" I thought to myself, feeling my heart beat more.</p> <p>Karen slid her arms around my waist just above my shoulders, and her hands slid up the front of my shirt to cup my breasts. "Are you sure this is what you want, Honey?" she asked. "I know I'll be looking forward to this all weekend." I just smiled, and nodded back, with a grin forming on my face, which was even broader at the expression on her face as she squeezed me tight. We moved apart quickly, and Karen kissed me gently, as her hands were moving back to my breasts once again.</p> <p>I grabbed a pillow and pushed it under my chest, as I slid down off the chair and fell onto the bed. As I lay in the bed and closed my eyes, not knowing what to do with my hands, I opened them, and looked at the clock. "I got to go in about 2:00, Honey!" I exclaimed, still watching the clock, and also looking at the clock again. "It's 1:00," I said, as she giggled as her hands began moving over my nipples, squeezing gently and rubbing them. I sighed, contentedly. "What?" she asked, as she cupped my breasts in her hands while moving her thumbs over my nipples, and I nodded, in response. "That's 2:00," I said, and reached back to caress her breasts, which were so firm and so smooth, I could hardly believe how sensitive they were.</p> <p>"Well, we'll go have the tub, I think." She got up as I reached for the bathrobe she'd placed on the chair next to the bed, a towel wrapped around herself. When she started walking toward the door, she paused, and I watched her sway them back towards the bed. It really wasn't enough: I still found it very disconcerting, though as I put a stop to it, I found I couldn't stop myself from thinking "I've always had this power over guys," or "I never could resist Karen," or... "I'm a woman sometimes," I thought.</p> <p>I watched as she pulled the door open, and then turned to face the bed again. She held the bathrobe tightly, letting me know it wasn't going to come off as she stepped out into the hallway, and then walked out to where my robe was hanging in the bedroom window. There was more than enough room to pull out the pillow, and even lay back on the bed to relax. I put a pillow, towel, and a blanket over us as she climbed onto the bed, then reached for the bedhead with her left hand as she reached for the towel with her right. Once I sat up to let her pull the towel off, it came down to rest on my right side, just below my right hip bone, and ended with a thin pillow on the left side of my body, but leaving only my left hip bone exposed, where if she sat a few inches off the bed, it wouldn't have a direct line to it. As she sat between me and the pillow, I reached for and cupped her left breast, as she continued to remove the knot at the center of the bathrobe until it was just above her knee.</p> <p>As she slipped off the bathrobe, and held the towel out from the bathrobe, one of her hands drifted down my body to my waistline, where her palm caressed me for a few minutes from top to bottom, lightly. Her fingers reached to the edges of the towel, and then moved back up again, to my breasts, where they found my nipples, which I was a little apprehensive about the feeling of yet again being touched. When she lightly brushed my nipples again, they hardened, and I shuddered. Then, her fingers curled around them, and I gasped in response to the sensation. This happened a few times, and when I realized the feeling was mutual, my nipples got even harder.</p> <p>She moved around to the edge of the bed, and I watched her walk back to where I lay. When she turned away from the bed, and I watched as her robe slipped completely off, her breasts were almost bouncing with the swing of the bedroom as she walked around to close her robe a couple feet behind her.
