I groaned, as she began to suck harder and faster on the head of my cock as her lips wrapped tightly around it.</p> <p>"Come with me!" she urged, pulling her mouth off my cock.</p> <p>She climbed onto the bed, taking my throbbing cock with her as she rose up, rubbing her tits on my stomach as she straddled me.</p> <p>"Come with me," she insisted, pressing her wet pussy firmly against the head of my cock. I knew where I wanted to be.</p> <p>She positioned herself, leaning forward and then lowering herself as I guided my cock to the lips of her pussy. Slowly I pushed deeper into her pussy as I felt the soft velvet skin of her inner lips press against the flesh of my cock. She was completely soaked and as I felt the slickness of her pussy, I had difficulty pushing further into her. I wanted to watch her face.</p> <p>"Fuck, that's good!" She began to grind her pelvis against my erection, slowly at first. "Do it. Fuckme! Fuckme!" She wailed as I grabbed her hips and began to lift her up and down on my rigid cock.</p> <p>My eyes feasted on her tits swaying wildly as she bucked her hips up and down, feeling my cock sliding in and out of her.

She began to move against me again, grinding her clit against my pubic bone.</p> <p>We lay there, joined in bed, our bodies sticky, our bodies intertwined.</p> <p>"That was..." she began to say. "...great!" She turned on her side and looked up at me as I was still lying on my back.</p> <p>I reached up and pulled her on top of me, spooning up against me.</p> <p>"That was great!"
