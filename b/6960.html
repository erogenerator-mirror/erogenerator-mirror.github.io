Now I have nothing to wear. Or nothing to wear. Well, there are clothes on the clothes rack to choose from. I'm sure I will pick something. It won't hurt, and if it's something that could be useful, it won't help. It was nice, after all.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>I reach up under my t-shirt and pull it out, then I reach back down again and pick up the t-shirt. I feel the t-shirt between my breasts, rubbing against them with my fingers. It smells of soap and my own excitement. It makes me feel hot and tingly.</p> <p>I pull it on, pulling it tight. I look at myself in the mirror. Yes, I look hot. It is a little better. It seems kind of nice. "Why did I buy the t-shirt? I'm sure no other girls would wear it, much less me. But, this might help. Just something. Why not wear panties? I have to have to have them. I don't know what kind of outfit to put underneath. I think I have a few at home. "</p> <p>"But," she says, "This isn't my home, and it's not you."</p> <p>That's true. That's my problem. I want it so bad right now, and I can tell she understands.</p> <p>"I don't think you know that right, and I haven't seen you in years. I think you are the most interesting girl in the world. But, there is something else I want to talk to you about. I think maybe there is something you need.</p> <p>"I've heard of girls like you. It's a strange thing for them to say, but, there is something that it would look good on you if I took you out to eat on a date with someone at home. You were so nice and warm and caring earlier.</p> <p>"You might want to know about a few things first. First of all, you won't know about them until you go home and take them home. Second, and best, if you go back home, you'll probably be in a bad spot for a couple of weeks, probably. And think that it makes no sense to try going out for a meal after they have a date with you. A guy has to be happy. Even after you get out of the bar, maybe he's going to treat you properly, but he's your boyfriend, now.</p> <p>"Also," she says, "If you're not going to go out with a guy, maybe this is the best thing. This would be a long time."</p> <p>"But I'm not really going out with anyone. I'm just going to go home and, I hope, make out with you."</p> <p>"You can't date, sweetheart." She's trying hard. She thinks about it all. The fact that I haven't gone out in all this time with anyone else is hard to admit. I don't really feel like a boyfriend. Maybe she's not really a nice girl. Maybe it's just bad luck that every girl I have dated is not really nice looking. Maybe it's just her and her friends. Maybe her friends just don't want to date her, and I'm supposed to be friends with her. I'm being stupid and feeling like shit again. I'm probably making a fool of myself. She gets up and leaves the room leaving me alone with my thoughts. She hasn't said anything about the t-shirt, so I don't know if I'm in trouble or not.</p> <p>I'm standing outside her door a few minutes later. She opens up. She doesn't notice me. She looks me up and down and I think that's all that's stopping her. We talk on the phone for a while. I just look at her and see that she doesn't have a ring to her left hand. "What about the t-shirt?" I ask her. I can't imagine how to tell her that it's still in her hand and that she's been waiting for me. I can't even imagine what my own voice sounds like. "I'm not really going to wear that for you, sweetheart." She has this look. It's a sort of desperate need and desperation in her eyes, so I tell her it's fine. "And no, just put it back." I hold it up for her, trying to not look serious. "Can I take it?" I look at the t-shirt again. I can't decide if I would like it to stay. It's too big. "Maybe you shouldn't," I say.</p> <p>She takes it from my hands. It seems like a strange thing to do. She puts it back in her little dresser drawer and goes back to her room. I wonder if she could have just pulled itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
