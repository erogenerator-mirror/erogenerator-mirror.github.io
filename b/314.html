I said. Then I leaned forward and rested my hands on his broad shoulders. As we continued to kiss, I slid my hands down over his pants until they rested on his ass. We continued to kiss, softly at first and then more aggressively, slowly building the tension, but never really ending the kiss. Our hands began to roam over each other's bodies. I slid my hand into his pants and found that his semi-hard dick was already semi-erect from our hot embrace. With my other hand, I unbuttoned his pants and slid them open. By this time, the bulge in his boxer was poking out and I began to caress it through his underwear. "Mmmm," he mewled and I pulled his boxers down and off then grabbed his dick. "Oh, I don't know what got into me but I really like it," I said as I stroked him. "Honey, I want you to make this right," I said as I leaned around him for another kiss.</p> <p>After the first kiss, I lifted my mouth off his and looked into his eyes. "Do you have any lube in the house? If not, can we use the bed or the couch or whatever," I said, thinking about how he always used a vibrator in his bed when we'd come to bed together when he was a teenager.</p> <p>"Oh, I think I got the idea!" he said. "Here, I'll go get it." And he headed off towards the bedroom. I grabbed my clothes off the couch and sat down.</p> <p>"So, if I go to bed with you, could you make it worth my while for me? I'm so happy to be back with you!" I said. Then I thought to myself what a great way to get out of making the bed for him! He had always wanted me to come to bed with him but never thought that he wanted me in bed with him. I sat there waiting for him to come back, thinking of all these years but never thought I would ever want to go that far. Then I thought of the last time I made love to him and I felt my pussy getting wetter and wetter. I could hardly wait. All of these years, I've dreamt about this night. And I sure, thought about making the bed. I'd be lying naked with this man for a while. He'd feel real good and I would think that we'd be having great sex.</p> <p>"Honey, I think I have your lube. I have some a little bigger on the bed, I'll lay down on it so you can use it!" he said, indicating the bed.</p> <p>I jumped up and stripped off my clothes, then turned on the bed and lay down on it. With his back towards me, he bent his head down as I got near and began to kiss his neck and face. I leaned forward and kissed him lightly at the base of his neck. We kissed for what felt like an eternity, then I whispered, "Mmm, you're really beautiful, aren't you"? Then I took my lips down to his neck and began to kiss him there. I was so turned on by this, he could feel it. I kissed the base of his neck and continued to kiss down to the top of his chest, then his upper chest and finally to his nipples. As I started to kiss his belly, he reached for my head with one hand and we kissed again passionately. I could feel the warmth and softness of his skin through his shirt and he felt incredible as he wrapped his arms around me. I pulled my head up and opened the front of his shirt and kissed his nipple. He began to moan softly and I started to suck on it then bit it a little. He began to caress my head gently with his hand and we kissed even more hungrily. He began to roll my nipples between his fingers and he ran his fingernails down to my ass.</p> <p>"Mmmm, Honey, I just love the feeling of your hand on me," I said, as I continued to kiss and nibble on his nipples.</p> <p>"Mmm, I'm so turned on and glad we could do this," he said.</p> <p>"That's good, because I'd love more of you to do me." I answered. "I do have the idea of you doing me. I could lie on my back and you could do me from behind," and I pulled him down and he got on top of me. We kissed for what seemed like ages and eventually, it ended. He continued to caress my body with his hands. It felt great to have him touch me, to feel him touch me. It made me feel alive sexually to know he loved me. And that gave me one of the most exciting times in my life.</p> <p>He began to kiss down to my tumâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
