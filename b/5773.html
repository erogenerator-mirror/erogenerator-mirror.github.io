I can't imagine how you did it so long. I guess you could say I inherited his good looks." I said with a laugh. "But if I remember, I was right. No big deal."</p> <p>"I did. Well I can't say that I have regretted not having a chance to enjoy your sweet breasts. It was worth it, though." he teased as he moved his hands around my waist to pull me close to kiss me again.</p> <p>I was getting a bit weak in the knees from the passionate kiss. "I'm sorry. I don't know how many times I've heard this old man say he's still a good fuck."</p> <p>"It's all right. It was just a little too much to do with my family. Besides, you're still way too old for me."</p> <p>"Oh yes, I'm still a young and sexy lady. For your information, I'm twenty and I'll always be a fun little thing to play with."</p> <p>I was a bit embarrassed for saying that before. I don't mind a little old fatter pussy, after all. If not for the nice long ride he was giving me, we might well bump into old guy. It's only a few days ride up though. He was only looking out the window watching the sun set over the horizon and the waves rolling in.</p> <p>"I guess I'd better get going." I said with a little giggle. I knew if anyone else saw me I probably would. "But that doesn't mean you have to. We would never be a couple."</p> <p>"Of course not, it's just an old man's body I wouldn't mind having too." he said with a laugh. He leaned into me and kissed me again. This time I wasn't going to be so easily moved around. The older he got, the younger he seemed to be more aggressive. He pulled back and looked at me sitting in the seat next to him. His gaze was focused on my face. He knew that I'd be seeing this with a certain level of lust growing between us.</p> <p>I leaned my head back and let out a soft sigh. I pulled my tank top over my breast and let it drop to the bench next to him. He leaned over and started gently tracing his fingers along my nipple which made me shiver and squirm. I reached down and pulled him toward me. Kissing him deeply he moved his kisses down to my neck and chest. I ran my fingers into his t-shirt. I didn't want him to be too sensitive after all.</p> <p>Then he broke the kiss and stepped back to look at me. "You've always made me hard, Ashleigh."</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed and sucked on my nipple, making me quiver against the bench. He pulled back and started unbuttoning my blouse. When he had it off and removed the blouse he took me in his arms again.</p> <p>Without warning my mouth was captured in a deep, searching, tongue exploring kiss. I could feel that old man's manhood pressing urgently against me. My nipples were hard and pressing into him and it felt incredible.</p> <p>"Hmmmm." he breathed against my lips. "Your old man's body feels as good as your own." he teased as he reached behind to undo my bra.</p> <p>I pushed his shoulders backward and slipped off the bench, rolling him over so that I could continue my tongue dancing over his lips as much as I could. His hands grabbed at my hips, his fingers digging deeply into my ass and making me squirm against his groin.</p> <p>I was desperate to feel his body against mine and to keep my hands on his beautiful chest and his hands on my ass, but he made it clear that we did not want to make love. He rolled me off the bench and he pulled my body down to his for a deep, slow kiss. I melted against him and felt his tongue slip between my lips. It wasn't long before I found myself trying to catch it as it flicked against my tongue.</p> <p>He was running his hands through my long brunette hair as he leaned back to look at me. I couldn't help it. It was all I could do to keep from arching my head back to meet his eyes as he kissed me. The way he held me close. The way he looked at me as he did so. It was crazy. All I could do was wonder what would have happened next if the old man had been interested and wanted it as much as I did. But, god, this man, this wonderful, wonderful old man wanted to fuck me. His hands wandered to my breasts, rolling my nipples between his fingers. His lips and tongue moved to my neck and shoulders, and I could feel him sucking on each one as he slid his hands down to my legsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
