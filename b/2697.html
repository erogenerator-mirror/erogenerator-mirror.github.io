I'm not sure of what's really going on at first, but when Amy and I got to talking the rest of the evening I started getting horny, which surprised her. And she got very quiet.</p> <p>I know I said I needed some relief. But I was also feeling incredibly horny, which led to an intense orgasm with my hand still down her dress. And in my mind I could still feel my cock stirring in my pants, which I tried to hide, unsuccessfully, by making myself cum. But the sensations I was feeling seemed to be increasing exponentially.</p> <p>Before I knew what happened I was pushing her hand away and falling to the floor, trying to stave off the pressure building up in my groin. And when I looked up to find Amy staring at me with her dark brown eyes I realized I was having my very first orgasm of the evening.</p> <p>"I...I'm sorry," she stammered.</p> <p>"No, don't stop honey," I said, and kissed her once more.</p> <p>I felt incredible, my body shaking with ecstasy as she lay there in front of me, watching my face contort with lust. I've never felt quite this way with anyone, and Amy was the first girl I'd ever been with. To be honest I was always apprehensive about taking advantage of her, but I loved being with her. I really loved her, even if I had no intention of doing anything with her. She didn't seem to be the type of girl who would like to have anything to do with me.</p> <p>After resting awhile I walked her to the door, and she took me by the hand and we went back to work in the office at the mall. It had been a while since I'd last had any type of sex. It's a little embarrassing to talk about such things when you're having one of those explosive orgasms, because all the details are far more erotic than it had been before, but I think it was more for my own pleasure. She was just like any other man, and I knew there was no turning back.</p> <p>It was a short time later that I looked down the street, and that's all I knew about my morning. I spent the rest of the afternoon and night with Amy in the back of a car in our driveway, and I had a wonderful time until the office closed.</p> <p>My job had been done, so all I knew about it was vague. But I enjoyed knowing that I had made this woman of mine cum for me. For some reason I wasn't able to bring myself to tell her that. And now it was my turn to make her cum for me.</p> <p>The next time I went to see Amy and our conversation became more sexually charged when I mentioned her saying she and Greg had been going to this party just a few days ago. Amy told me a friend had recommended the club, and all I had to do was talk her into coming to the party.</p> <p>I agreed, and Amy, while I had agreed to go on, agreed to join. We drove home afterwards, and Amy and I had a long talk about our sexual lives. I told her how hot she looked and how horny I had just been.</p> <p>She agreed with me on the second part, but it didn't sound all that convincing. We got home around midday, and started making love again. Just before we got to enjoying ourselves, I told her I had to be gone from the store for at least thirty minutes. To which she agreed, which was really great, because it seemed like an eternity, when it finally got back to my place to have sex. I'd been gone for several hours.</p> <p>As for the meeting and my time with Amy, I had to admit it was a real turn-on. I had already felt that way because of the intensity of my orgasm for her, and now I felt the same way, because as we made love I found myself liking Amy's body, and my libido was growing and driving me on. And I realized that what I had just done had not really gone as planned.</p> <p>When I found that I had been a bit of a jerk in getting the key to the door, I had to use my brain to come up with a reasonable explanation, even telling myself that I had just seen a beautiful young woman in nothing more than her panties, a naked girl, and I didn't know it.</p> <p>Amy, however, insisted I go on.</p> <p>"You know I can't get over seeing you naked," she said. "I'm so wet right now, I think I might..."</p> <p>She had no idea how horny I was.</p> <p>I did ask her about it later. I had really enjoyed watching her strip, taking off her blouse, then putting her bra on, then the skirt. By the time we had finished watching some mindless TV, she was moaning and askingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
