Standing naked, I took off my robe and lay on the bed. As I layed, I thought: that's what a naked girl feels like, I can touch myself all I want while I'm lying in the middle of a naked male body. And I can still feel his warmth, his eyes. All I can see is light, the blue light that dances on a body like that; and I can still feel a cock between my legs. But I also feel his warmth, it's been warm, it's soft, it's all. It feels good on my skin. It feels good when you move up and down it slowly and gently. And it feels good when you take it all in, it feels good when I slowly move my muscles up and down, and his fingers in my hands feel good, like they'll fit. I don't think I can last a second. And then I'm coming again, and this time, I can't stop. I just keep coming. Then you come. And you've got my arms up, and his cock in me, and I think I just gave him the best orgasm of his life. Oh...and it feels good all over.</p> <p>I'm sitting up and staring at him, waiting. Finally, I find him, and he leans over and kisses me, his tongue touching the tip of mine lightly. He has his hands on my breasts, caressing me and squeezing, and he reaches down between my legs. I get very aroused, because I think I feel his cock pressing against me, and it feels good. He starts feeling my breasts and I reach down, and reach down into his crotch. It's very wet, so it slips easily into my hand. He's really hard and I know what he's thinking as soon as it goes in. He pulls his pants down on one side and then I reach up and run my fingers over his cock, rubbing it up and down. I keep stroking, just lightly. He's got it pretty hard and it's throbbing. His cock is nice and warm, I stroke him. Then I slide my hand down further and he's all wet. So I start stroking him. He starts thrusting away towards me. He's really hard. So when he comes, it makes me come.</p> <p>I'm lying there, looking at him, looking into his eyes, and I can see his hand on my breasts. And it feels so good when he fucks me. My fingers move like he did, and I'm thinking: what if it was me. And if I was here and this was what I wanted, and I could do all these things. I'm thinking: what if I was here and his cock and this was what I couldn't say?</p> <p>I lieed there a while and thought for a bit. He doesn't kiss me anymore, and they do it in the shower or in bed. He's got some of my semen on his lips and his tongue, so I put a glob on his lips too. He doesn't stop smiling and we kiss some more. Then a hand begins to work on my breasts, and it's not an erotic thing anymore. It's sensual. And I'm sure it'll happen all the time. This thing is really getting to him now and he's been getting really close to a climax. I can feel him pressing all over the place, he likes my boobs.</p> <p>We have a few more moments, and then I go and layed back in the bed. I'm still naked, but he's not gone, so I can lie here and stroke myself while he's watching. I'm not sure I can handle it any more. Then he sits up - and kisses me. My arms are around him, the feeling is really nice and arousing, but when he sticks it in, I'm still sitting and not going off like I was before, but I can't stop it now because I want it to, and it's feeling good and I want it to always be like this.</p> <p>"You're a beautiful girl, Sally, I can't get enough of you."</p> <p>I could do that, I can do whatever I want, and I want him to feel the same. And I want him to put his hand under my ass and feel my body underneath his. And then I can tell him how sexy I am with this and make him feel as good as I do when he's on top of me, and this all feels really good, it feels really good. So I just smile up at him.</p> <p>He says, and I just smile back. And his hand moves, and they're really moving around, and he's doing something that felt really good.
