She asked as she continued looking around the room.</p> <p>"No, not really." He smiled and said "I just want to tell you that..."</p> <p>"You wanna know the thing I wanted to tell you?"</p> <p>"I don't want to guess." He grinned "If you can tell..."</p> <p>"Just go on," I nodded, "you don't have to. You can tell me anything," I offered.</p> <p>"The way I want to go is, I know you think I'm very attractive, you can tell me that."</p> <p>I smiled. He was obviously trying to set me up for anything, but he wasn't going to let me be the one that let her in on the idea. "You're very attractive." I told him "You are definitely not skinny or fat but you have that natural way about you, that's something that could really interest one of your friends."</p> <p>"What do you mean; she's not really looking at me right now?" Ben replied as he shook his head a little.</p> <p>"No, she's not either," I told him. "What I'm thinking of is, what are you going to do if I tell you she's attracted to you?" I asked.</p> <p>Ben just shrugged a little, he knew the answer already. I could see him thinking about it. That wasn't the least bit scary, it was just scary.</p> <p>"She's not a big fan of guys being guys and men just trying to get into your pants," I said "She's got lots of friends who are really into her."</p> <p>"I thought she was your boyfriend," she said a little defensively.</p> <p>"No she's not, it's just that she's very... not as..." I had to pause because he was clearly trying to explain. "There are lots of people who would be really into her..." he started. He started to smile again.</p> <p>"No you don't," I said, "you're the one with a crush on her!" He shook his head, but he didn't get offended.</p> <p>"Well, you might be tempted to kiss her when she asks you," I smiled, "but it's not going to happen."</p> <p>"Thanks, but it's not going to happen," he said quickly before I could say anything. "But maybe when she asks me to dance or something..." he nodded at her.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'm not trying to have a relationship with you," I assured him. "You've got to trust me. She's going to get over it and see that she really likes you, I'm pretty sure she's told you that already."</p> <p>"I don't trust her any more," he said, "and you have to know I trust you again."</p> <p>"I won't," I laughed at him.</p> <p>"Do you think you're in love with anyone or something?" He asked. I could feel how surprised all of that conversation was getting. Ben really seemed to be struggling to believe that he had made a pretty good decision.</p> <p>"No. I've just never had a relationship with anybody," I said, "It was never really that kind of relationship." I said. Then I turned back to Ben and smiled "So we'll just see what happens?" I asked. "I don't know." He frowned at my statement, "You might be wondering what you're doing and I don't think I will either."</p> <p>"If you're the problem, go ahead," I said, "I have lots of questions for you."</p> <p>"Nope, not right now!" He said as he looked around the room, "I'm just going to make sure you know there's never anyplace I could get a good night's sleep tonight."</p> <p>"I know," I replied, "Just make sure you get yourself a good night's rest tomorrow after work." I finished off the rest of my wine. "You can take my ass for a bit," I told him. He grinned at me and agreed.</p> <p>We sat there for a few minutes just looking out the window at the lights of the city outside. I could see that people who would normally be on their way home for the night weren't here. It was nice having a bit of a city atmosphere to sit in and drink wine with Ben.</p> <p>That wasn't all that was nice though. I could feel his eyes staring at me, and what I was doing. It was even worse than I'd ever think of, I think I was doing it for him, but he didn't say anything. I had a feeling he was just being a nice nice guy at first.</p> <p>He was a nice guyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
