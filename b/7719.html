Both had their arms out to either side of her. She looked away in shame. He smiled, his face turned up to her.</p> <p>"Well," he said, turning back to his coffee. "So I guess everyone will be happier after lunch." He looked back down at her and smiled softly. "That's good. I'm sure you will. After all we did." He lifted his coffee cup, "Here, have this." Then he leaned forward, and held his face close to hers. "I love you, too. I hope you will call me and try to come for visits."</p> <p>She looked up at him. "I never wanted to go. I wanted to keep to myself. You are...really nice."</p> <p>His arm draped over her shoulder as he leaned forward again. "Don't be angry, sweetheart. We will talk about that later. I'm sure you will." He lifted her face to his and pecked her lips softly. "But, if not, don't be afraid. I didn't mean to push you into anything." He smiled tenderly and stood, leaving her to sulk and wait for her next instructions.</p> <p>Her last thoughts were of being the center of his world, his very soul. And she knew that they would have a very strong and passionate relationship. She knew that with him it was going to be very special for her. But, she thought that she could only begin to see him when she came to her senses. That was until...</p> <p>Part 5</p> <p>"It'll be okay," he had said.</p> <p>His voice was deep and strong. "Relax, I'm not going to do anything." She watched as he pulled away from her, leaving her sitting still in the dark. He walked into the center of the large room. "Sit up on the couch, please," he said softly, and she obeyed. Her shoulders slumped as she sat down on the edge of the couch.</p> <p>He sat between her legs and she watched his eyes light up.</p> <p>"You are nervous," he looked at her and smiled. "I think you are. Not only are we going to talk, but I'm going to give you the kind of massage that I know you love." His fingertips reached up to stroke lightly up and down her bare leg. "I'm sure everyone here would enjoy it..." They just stood there for a beat as her eyes began to water again. "And we will do everything we can to get you to relax. Nothing you can't handle."</p> <p>His smile seemed brighter as he spoke of an old story they were going to read when they finished lunch.</p> <p>"...the only thing we need to understand is why you were crying."</p> <p>He was looking at her legs, the smooth, black stockings that glittered against the bare, pale skin of her thigh, before they closed.</p> <p>"...and what is done there."</p> <p>He turned to sit on the sofa, and leaned back against it. "Well?"</p> <p>She stood and walked over to him. She leaned him back against the back of the sofa and looked him over with loving eyes.</p> <p>"You certainly know all of those other things I need to know..." She ran her hands over his body as he shuddered in response. "...I'm sorry if you hate me and didn't want to come back, but...I just needed it, you know..."</p> <p>She was looking away again, trying to control the way she wanted to tell him, but it was too late. She felt his hand on the back of her neck, pressing her against the sofa's arm, and she could feel his erection pressing against her.</p> <p>"Don't worry, sweetheart," he said softly against the side of her neck, "I'm not going to hurt you, just give you a chance to think it through." His lips brushed against her ear, sending tingles up and down her neck and in between her breasts. "I know it seems like a big waste, but after reading all your stories, I think I will have a lot of fun with you." Their eyes locked.</p> <p>He raised her chin slowly, and his eyes were glowing with the heat that he knew would go deep.</p> <p>"There have been times when you've told me how much you love me. You told me that you love me as a lover. But, there was always that possibility that things might get worse around here and that we might end up in the same office. Or you might want me to be in the same office as you were a few days ago. Is that fair?" She could barely stand to look at him.
