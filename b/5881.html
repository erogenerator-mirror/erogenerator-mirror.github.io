"Oh, my, that's a wonderful massage. I think she's really enjoying being massaged."</p> <p>"That feels a little uncomfortable, but I want to keep it really pleasant," I told her.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm afraid I might just have to stop," she said. "I think this has been rather enjoyable for me."</p> <p>We had reached a mutual conclusion and I gently rubbed her body back through her arms again, as though to try and reassure her. She then put her hand on my cock again and stroked me up and down for several minutes. "God, I like that," she said. "I'm ready to fuck right now."</p> <p>Suddenly, the massage ended. I could now feel that she must have climaxed. This time, however, she took the opportunity to remove her bra, revealing a much larger rack. She pulled me on top of her and proceeded to kiss me with passion and ardor. Our kiss only lasted a few moments until our tongues were engaged again. She reached down with her hand and found my cock and started slowly stroking it. The feeling was exquisite, especially the feel of her fingers on my cock.</p> <p>Then she suddenly stopped kissing me and pulled me down to the bed. She lay on top of me. "Let me take your cock in my mouth," she whispered, but without hesitating for me to join. Her mouth, oh, the sensations of her lips on my cock were fantastic! I could have fucked her again, but I had to pull back. "Oh, God, I've had enough of these kisses, let's get our heads back into their chairs," I said, my hands going back to her breasts. I started to feel her nipples stiffen in her fingers.</p> <p>"Now," she said. "Please don't stop." I slid my hand under her so that it was in her pussy, finding her already stiffening clit.</p> <p>"I can't," she said simply. "Please, don't stop," she said again, her eyes pleading for me to put my finger in her. But, I could not. I knew it would take me a few seconds to get her vagina lubricated enough for my cock to enter her. My penis, too, was at last aroused, and this time she was willing to take it inside her.</p> <p>She stopped kissing me and pulled my hand from her breasts. "No, not yet," she said, "I'm still a little tender. Let me tell you something; I am not a virgin."</p> <p>"I want to do that too," I told her. She lay on her back with her legs spread wide. I lowered myself, entering her and entering her. "It feels so good," she whispered. "I can't begin to guess what it'll be like." Her voice drifted to a whisper. "I think I'm wet, too." I kept moving inside her. I could hardly breathe, so I started to move with increased rhythm. Soon, my body was jerking and twitching as it climaxed in unison with her. My body went rigid. My cock jerked several times. Her vagina squeezed me and I went rigid. "I came," she said quietly. "I can't believe I did that. Oh, that was incredible."</p> <p>"It was wonderful, too," I told her. Then asked, "Do you want me to put it in your ass?"</p> <p>"That's my idea. But, that would be way too gentle, right?" And after our mutual understanding of anal erotica, we did just that, sliding my cock all the way into her anus. It was so great, but we just couldn't enjoy the pleasure. We were still holding our positions when she whispered, "Please tell me what to do. I don't think I can do this anymore." I started to pull out of her, but she pushed me back. "Just lie still. I'm sorry, I think I'd just like to do something else."</p> <p>She went to that chair and took off her panties, and I watched her from the chair. She returned with a couple of toys we had purchased the day before. "Do we have some lube?" she asked. She handed me the lube along with one of the toys. "I have always wondered if I could bring myself to orgasm with only this kind of stimulation," she said with a naughty smile.</p> <p>"Oh!" I said joyfully. I didn't think it would be any good to waste it. "How may I put one on you?" I asked.</p> <p>"I have always liked the feeling of being penetrated by dildos," she said.
