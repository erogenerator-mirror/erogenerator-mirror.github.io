She would be disgusted by my idea. She would be mad I was trying to get her to think about fucking Jack. I would have to come up with an answer, and she would know. I want to give her the opportunity to know, it's why I was coming, I just don't have the confidence to do it to her. She will know. I will figure something out that will help me out. I will keep it to myself for now. I know it has taken almost a week to come, but you may be on your way up next week. I will have this talk with you sometime Thursday about things I need to talk about with Beth."</p> <p>As the week wore on I realized I had to talk to her. I thought maybe we could have an epiphany and save this marriage. I had decided that she would know soon enough. She just had to know it was me she was talking to. This was my way of getting there, I needed to find out what I was going to tell her. I needed to know she had already known. Maybe that was my only real chance of winning her trust back.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>Thursday evening the following week started with the beginning again at the family table. My mother and grandfather were getting ready to leave the house. The meeting finished about thirty minutes later. He had come to the house a couple of times before, but never went. He came home with his mom and father. They weren't home, he had driven to the grocery store a while ago, and he had to make a stop to go there. The meeting ended up around nine pm. I stood there listening and watching his car pull out of the driveway just before I saw the red truck turn down the street and pull into the garage in front of my father's garage. There was just a couple of seconds pause before he appeared out of the garage. We both started to laugh and he got in the driver's side of his car and we began talking to him. My father and mother continued talking for several minutes about nothing in particular. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was like seeing a scene out of a video. I watched the expression on the man's face change from happiness to surprise and then the expression was gone.</p> <p>My father had just got out of his car when Jack arrived in the garage. They immediately embraced. He took her hand. She pulled him into the house and into their bedroom. He pulled back and kissed her passionately. I walked over and pushed into the bedroom to join them. We fell on the bed kissing and laughing. My mother looked at me and smiled. "Are we ok with what is going on between us?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I don't really think I can explain how he came to think you thought it was going to be me. I'm pretty sure it is going to keep on happening. He has always wanted me to want you with the way you were. I told him he was right, he hasn't treated me with the disrespect you think you deserve. I don't even know the man that just took my virginity at that house."</p> <p>"I want you with my wife, Jack. I think I get it, I don't but it's not going to be the same. I have just the right attitude and attitude for you. He doesn't want me. We both know you aren't going to like our idea of our new home."</p> <p>"Yes, we will make sure that we never go back and fight to get back together. We can fight all we want now, but we can still make sure we never go back to work again. I will get a lawyer and have him sign the papers on the divorce papers."</p> <p>"It will only be a matter of time before I do the work for you, you know what to do don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I trust you to make sure everything is in the correct spot. I feel like I can depend on you."</p> <p>"Don't let me down, I'll do everything you want. I'll do whatever you say." I gave her ass one good sniff of her ass.</p> <p>We continued to talk about her and Jack's plan for the future. My mother told us this night would have been her first time thinking about Jack, and she was very sure she would have told me by now. They had a great sex life. I told her that my relationship with her was much more serious. I thought she was in a deep trance, but she kept on whispering, "Is this going to be anything other than the best sex we ever had before now?"</p> <p>I looked at her and nodded as I kissed her cheek. "It will be. We'll see. I've been dreaming about having you. We have already agreed on a future forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
