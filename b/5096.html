"If you're going to be tied up and not have sex, we have to make sure you enjoy yourself."</p> <p>I stared at him for a moment, and I nodded. If everything he had said was true, but the fact that he had a friend? I wasn't sure I wanted to see that happen, but I couldn't bring myself to say anything. I was afraid of the whole scene, but I knew if I didn't do something and was caught that night, my life would be over. When I looked back up at him, he was smiling into my eyes. He brushed my hair back, revealing the pale, dark strands against his chocolate tanned face.</p> <p>"Why don't you wait here awhile and we can come in some time if you're interested?" he grinned. "I'm not letting you out of my sight until you do," he said softly. "Besides I've got one more surprise to go in before we leave, so I guess you better go."</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter Three</p> <p>After I finished dressing, I got dressed as well. I had packed a small black bag as well and a couple of extra dresses and other items. I also got my hair done before he came home. He looked amazing in them, and even though he only looked the same size, it was hard for me to keep up with his movements. His eyes kept going back to my outfit, which looked exactly as I pictured it.</p> <p>"I got your hair done just as well," he said.</p> <p>"Just as I imagined," I said softly, giving him a kiss on the cheek. "I should probably get this dress. Maybe I'll need to look through a makeup bag."</p> <p>I turned and looked at the outfit I pulled on. The short silk dress had spaghetti straps and the material was sheer enough to leave no question that I was not wearing a bra. When I looked underneath, I saw no straps. When I looked to my side, my reflection, I saw an identical slip on white lace. When the dress finished, it looked great on me. It accentuated my curves while leaving the top of my breasts bare. The strapless bra, which was probably my favourite part of the dress, added some height so it also accentuated my cleavage. When I looked at my body in the mirror, I saw that my hips were wide and my ribs and legs emphasized my best asset. The red lace thong that matched the dress really made my ass look spectacular.</p> <p>When I finished putting on my clothes, I felt very sexy and sexy, with my hair still pinned up in a neat bun and my face glowing softly. I felt so incredibly desirable. I couldn't help but wonder what he would make of how I looked naked for him. Maybe just him making me topless and making me feel he owned me.</p> <p>As I stood with the finishing touch to my dress waiting for him to come home, I wondered if I could go to his room...</p> <p>A knock at the door made my heart stop beating, and I looked around for a moment, hoping that someone else had opened the door. I opened my door and saw him standing there, not in his boxers, but an outfit similar to his at least. When I turned around, I noticed the outfit I had picked earlier. If only he could see the way I was feeling...</p> <p>"Hey," he said, still grinning at me. "I don't suppose you're ready to leave yet?"</p> <p>"I still need to take today off," I said, looking at the time. "We're leaving on Friday, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah, but you can come by later tonight. I've got something new that looks really great."</p> <p>"It would be soo nice, honey," I said before getting in my car and speeding off.</p> <p>"Well, if you're sure you want me to take you," he said as soon as we were on the highway. "I guess I can wait until later. It's been a rough day."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, that happens too often," I said honestly. "I've got a lot to think about."</p> <p>"There's a couple of things that have to do," he said, looking around the car. "Come on, we'll go get dinner. I think you should know we eat in my car."</p> <p>"That sounds good to me," I said, giving him a kiss. "But if you're uncomfortable leaving here in the morning, I wouldn't mind."</p> <p>"Actually," he smiled, grabbing my head in his hand. "I'll take you to wherever you want to go and we can talk about getting dressed up afterwards. I'm sorry, it won't happen again."</p> <p>We got out of the truck and I sat downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
