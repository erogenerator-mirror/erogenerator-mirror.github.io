"Sure." He looked a little nervous. "I'll take care of it." Not that his cock had gotten any bigger from just holding in my hand, but it wasn't exactly shrinking though, as much as it was getting. "I'll pay off my debt from this." And now I really did not want to go.</p> <p>I had just walked into the class room when the bell on the door to my dorm rang. I walked over, walked in a couple of steps and stood right outside the door. I smiled when I saw the guy across the hallway. He was a tall, muscular man. A really hot guy. I just looked at him for a second, and I think I saw the sparkle in his eyes. He smiled at me, and looked me over. I guess my body language told him I was a bit shocked.</p> <p>"Well... hello. Who are you?"</p> <p>"I'm Scott." He said, extending his arms out.</p> <p>He held out his hand in a friendly greeting. I just said, "Hi, I'm Mike, from last week."</p> <p>"Ah, I see. Well I was wondering, why don't you go shower and come back here this time?"</p> <p>"Sure, I'm showering now. Sure." I started walking away from him, which caused my huge cock to sway a bit as I swayed.</p> <p>"Good. This is kind of the only locker room here, right?" I didn't know where that came from, but it did make a big difference. "You're really pretty." I said with a wry smile.</p> <p>"Yeah. I like guys too. Do they ever get it at home?" He said with a bit of a sly grin. He reached out and I took his hand and we got off the cold tile floor. His hand came almost to my cock though it seemed to be frozen in place. "It wouldn't have worked out if I had. Did you take my notes?" He asked, putting a hand on my chest. He gave me a peck on the lips before we got off the locker room floor and I led him down the hall.</p> <p>We went into the bathroom, locked the door and went into the shower. Scott was a bit shorter than I was, but that must be a big difference. For a guy that stands at 6'2, he looked damn good. He was a tall guy, but his legs couldn't be too wide, and I could stare at how toned his legs were.</p> <p>I took his hand in mine and looked him up and down, and said, "I like your body. I've always admired it on all of those girls I was with."</p> <p>"I'll have to say that I've got some appreciation for the shape of your legs too. That was a real kick." Scott had his eyes on my face. He smiled a bit.</p> <p>"Thanks." "Yeah, I do like those legs too." I said, as I let go of his cock and let my hand glide down his body to the front of his pants.</p> <p>He was obviously not all that hard, and I could feel the pre-cum seeping out of the head of his dick right as I touched it. I wrapped my hand around it, and started lightly stroking him. I couldn't believe it. Not only was this guy a guy, but he was really thick. I found his cock to be about 3/4". I slowly rubbed the shaft while I stroked him. Scott was very smooth. He had hair on his legs, but really short. I could see his pubic hair. His dick was so smooth. I could imagine what that would feel like sliding into my tight pussy.</p> <p>Scott looked at me and started talking. "I was curious about what you look like, when you girls weren't around to see, so I was wondering if I could try it out." He said, and took my hand and put it on his now-stiff hard-on. It was still covered. But his erection felt bigger than I had imagined. I looked down and saw it in my hand, and it was bigger, which really surprised me.</p> <p>Scott was getting excited. I had never seen a guy that big before, and I was sure he had never measured anything like this before. It really amazed me how impressive it was, how it got hard, how it got hard, so thick... I knew I could take that. And I realized it would be fun. Scott was so hot. I could feel the pressure in his dick, and it kind of rubbed the back of my hand.</p> <p>Scott looked down at me "So do you want to try to get a feel of your own..." I couldn't take it anymore.</p> <p>My own dick was rock hard and standing high against his crotch.
