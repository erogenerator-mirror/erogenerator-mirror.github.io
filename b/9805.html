She whispered in my ear.</p> <p>I looked around the room once more as my heart began to pound beneath my chest and my cock began to get hard. She turned and leaned close to me on the bed as we kissed, her arm wrapped around me and her mouth pressing firmly against my lips. I could feel her breasts against my chest and the hardness of my cock growing. Slowly, I removed my hand from her waist and placed it on her firm round ass. She was wearing a thin baby doll pink dress and I began squeezing her cheeks firmly. My hand slid up and down her crack and I caressed my finger across her asshole as she moaned softly.</p> <p>"What, you can't do that. Oh God I love what you're doing, just like I love what you're going to do to me tonight," she breathed deeply in my ear as she broke the kiss and sat up. She pulled my hand from her and laid my fingers on her soft lips, "But not for long little brother," she said. Her head began to roll side to side as her body began to tremble slightly. "I'm about to cum," she muttered.</p> <p>I began to move my hand up and down as my sister's legs trembled as well. Her body began shaking violently and her voice began to shake. There was no turning back. I was in love with her and here she was going crazy with it. Her body was becoming an out of control orgasm and I was too. The pressure began to build and build inside as she began to tremble violently and I was too. She was shaking uncontrollably as cum erupted from her body. She was panting wildly into my neck and I kissed her deeply letting the last of the orgasm subside. There wasn't anything left, I wasn't going anywhere. I wasn't even going to try and put it back in her when the pressure inside was too much for her to handle. She began to cry softly into my shoulder and then sobbed uncontrollably.</p> <p>As the blood began to ease from her neck and face she began to calm down and began to regain her composure. It was several minutes before she looked up at me and smiled a sweet smile. She leaned forward and kissed me tenderly as she looked back at me with her big brown eyes. I turned to kiss her again and our lips met again. This time our tongues touched softly against each other. I moved to get on top of her as she wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled me into her. I moved my hands up to her face and traced her lips lightly with my fingertips as I kissed her. I could taste the saltiness of her mouth and the salty tang and I couldn't wait to taste more. She held my head gently as her body began to respond, her arms held my head gently in place allowing me to explore her mouth hungrily. Once I felt her body relax and her body was still shuddering I decided to stop and rolled onto my side.</p> <p>We were looking at each other in an unspoken stare that spoke volumes about what we felt for each other. I leaned my head on her shoulder as we both tried to catch our breath and hold onto each other to get our heartbeats back to normal. "Was that really you?" I whispered into her ear.</p> <p>"I don't know. It seemed like a long time ago but I'm sure that's the reason I'm back!" She giggled softly as her head turned toward mine and we shared a tender tender kiss.</p> <p>I took a few moments to compose myself and then lay next to my sister as she stretched luxuriously in her bed with the covers thrown back. "You've changed for the better, aren't you?" I whispered softly in her ear before kissing her gently once again.</p> <p>"You know I always want you to be like this with me." She replied softly.</p> <p>"Good to hear," I replied, "You know that I'm a big fan of you don't you."</p> <p>"The way you are with me, I can't imagine what you can be like with someone like me." She replied as she looked into my eyes.</p> <p>My eyes were already wide with worry. I was worried that I wouldn't be in her life tonight. She didn't seem to notice my emotions at all.</p> <p>"Yes." She said with a deep voice. "I can't help but be very curious about you."</p> <p>"I'm just glad that you got a chance to see me a while ago." I replied with a knowing smile.</p> <p>"I just hope that it would be ok if we did this again but not too soon." She said softly.</p> <p>"I don't want you to think that I've changed at all, but I will have to tell you about that tomorrow so you won't be too worried if we do it again!"
