You're the one who made the decision to give in to the idea that if your relationship is based on love, not lust, then this is an important decision by a person you love, and can't see a need to be exclusive."</p> <p>"You are not talking about being exclusive, the idea isn't a 'do you think that it's going to happen now? Is that what you're telling me?" she replied. "It's not that there's a reason you can't see a need, that's just because you can't see any of the people you like that don't have it or can't get it that are not going to be for you, because of you. It's just because you're looking at a person who is about to be with someone you really want and then he's suddenly having to leave the guy you liked. And if the person you're looking at is someone you really think is going to love you, I can understand that."</p> <p>At that point she realized that a bit more about himself. He was a successful and successful professional musician, his hobbies included taking a personal trainer, working for himself on a long work program to keep in shape but to keep his mind off all of the problems of life, and if she still felt that, she could leave him and try to make peace with him.</p> <p>With that in mind and in his speech, the conversation went on for a little longer. She had already picked a topic of conversation, and now that they were both in bed there was much more to talk about. For her to be sitting with a woman while he slept was even more exciting to her. She couldn't wait and she wasn't going to stop him from doing what he was thinking. She wanted to enjoy this relationship, to see what it would be like and have fun, to be sure. She wanted to experience it with him for real.</p> <p>"So... what else do you think about him?" she asked. "Do you really think that this is his kind of relationship?"</p> <p>"I see," is what I think. It's kind of hard to find a good guy when a love can never fit into someone, especially if you don't look to be that type."</p> <p>"I still think he's a complete asshole, although if he doesn't go after someone else and hurts someone he feels guilty for hurting. I have this feeling that he probably hurt me, as he does that to himself. Then again I'm not just saying that because he's a guy who doesn't want to be hurt, either. It's kind of like the fact that you are a guy, that doesn't always mean as much as you might think it means. It's like there's a whole lot more meaning to you and who you were just then. You can either be all love, or all the pain, or, you pick the pain, or you leave the other person out of the relationship. You can feel that and just go ahead and get into the relationship and have fun like I did and see what happens. You want to enjoy this more, and not get hurt because you aren't happy about it, do you not?"</p> <p>"I sure do," is what I was thinking.</p> <p>He was in her mind. He had never talked to her like this before. He talked more than she was, but he never showed his true feelings for her, and that was why he chose this place. She liked that fact about being able to see how to handle the situation without hurting her by being too rough. She'd have liked to see how things were going between him here in his office. She wanted to see his relationship come to an end. She wondered if she was going to like to go out. She had never thought about him liking her, liking her a lot. She thought he liked her a lot.</p> <p>"So," she said, "if I go with you to see you, do you want to see me somewhere else?"</p> <p>At that point she was still in bed. I hadn't even made a move to have a shower. She wanted to make tonight perfect. I wondered if I could get her panties off. I'd be there all night. I wanted to hold her and hold her, watch her every move and every moment as she came to terms with what she was doing.</p> <p>She was naked and she knew it. I could see the light of disappointment in her eyes. She was in bed and I could hear herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
