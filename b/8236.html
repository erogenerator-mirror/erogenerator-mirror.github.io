It feels so, so right. Just remember to trust me." Lisa said softly as I continued to stroke into her with long slow strokes, taking care to avoid slipping out of her. Lisa closed her eyes and her breathing started to increase as I increased the speed.</p> <p>"I love you, too, my love!" she said with a smile.</p> <p>My mind was in a cloud of bliss as I continued to drive into Lisa, both of us enjoying the moment. I looked down to see her soft breasts swaying from my movements, she looked so beautiful. I took full control of my breathing, which were now synchronized with Lisa's.</p> <p>As I began a slow withdrawal of my cock from my lover, I saw it appear before me. Lisa pulled a finger down to her mouth and began to lick it. I continued my slow withdrawal, the tip of my cock just barely brushing her inner lips. As I pulled out almost all of it disappeared again. I kept up a slow rhythm of long strokes from my base right up to just above her clit as I did just that, driving her over the edge. Lisa kept licking her lips as waves of pleasure rippled through her body. Every time I pulled out all the way before plunging deep into her again with a slow motion, there was a slight change in pressure that sent a pleasurable shiver racing through her body. In no time at all, Lisa began moaning, and her body began shaking as an orgasm rocked her body.</p> <p>For a moment I thought she was done, but I thought she was enjoying it. She opened her eyes and looked at me. Just as her orgasm began to subside, Lisa pulled free and laid beside me, pulling me close with her arm beside me.</p> <p>"I think it's pretty warm down there." she said, with a satisfied smile. "I'm glad you've come out of that cold shower."</p> <p>"I didn't expect you to be back so soon." I said with a laugh. Lisa laughed as well and leaned over to kiss me.</p> <p>"Did you enjoy yourself, big boy?"</p> <p>I kissed her back with passion and nodded.</p> <p>"I'm glad it was fun." I said, trying not to feel too forward, but it was no use. She had never spoken to me in such terms, and I was glad I was home. Lisa pulled me in to her arms and began to kiss me again, her hand caressing and rubbing at my chest.</p> <p>"Now, go ahead and take a shower, I can see that you really are ready."</p> <p>In the next bedroom, Jason had left, returning with a clean towel and a new pair of worn panties. He took the clean white panties and wiped Lisa's juices from his fingers. He had taken them off her about an hour previously. The last pair he had taken off was a smaller one, a thong, but they were still soaked.</p> <p>"Mmm I bet they didn't hurt you. I bet they could have hurt me. I've been thinking about the next time you'll come home."</p> <p>Lisa sat up a little and smiled at me with a mischievous look. She pulled the new panties and panties out of my hand and lifted them to her nose. "Hmm I love their smell." she said before taking my cock in her hand. She began to smear the panties across my head before she pushed them hard against me. Jason came over and held me tight. He gave my cock a couple strokes before he stood and moved over next to me.</p> <p>Lisa put his cock in her mouth as Jason began stroking her hair.</p> <p>"Do you think he'd be back tonight?" Lisa asked, a question in her tone of voice.</p> <p>"I think he's already here." I said with a smile. "He's in his apartment. I don't think he'd be home tonight, but he still might be here later tonight."</p> <p>Lisa smiled up at Jason as she pulled his cock towards her. When he was fully engulfed by her, Lisa moved him further back than she could and then began to bob up and down, her head bobbing up and down on his shaft in front of him. Her eyes had a glazed look as she worked his cock in and out of her mouth, taking a little more each time. Her body was shaking from the combination of the friction from Jason's cock in and out of her mouth, and the sensation of the panties rubbing her clit at the top of her thigh as he fucked her.</p> <p>I watched through the door while Jason had her, holding her thighs as Jason fucked her mouth. Lisa's moans and groans could be heard throughout the apartment. My cock began to throb and began to ache for release.</p> <p>"That's it myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
