"Fuck me like I'm your wife. Fucking pound me with that hard rod. Go deep, put it in..."</p> <p>Steve fucked the hell out of his wife. He pounded her hard and deep making her yell out. She was on top of her husband pushing back against him. The sight of her ass bouncing up and down Steve's lap, driving him insane with lust.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I love how you fuck my tight pussy with that big cock..." she said as Steve pulled her into his face.</p> <p>They switched places and began to tongue wrestle. Her legs wrapped around his hips as they continued to fuck. He loved seeing her ass shaking with his big cock repeatedly in and out as they fucked. Steve's cock was rock hard and sticking straight up as he drove the hell out of her ass.</p> <p>"That feels good Steve. Keep fucking..." she said between gasps.</p> <p>Steve responded by putting two fingers in her pussy.</p> <p>"Are you okay with this? Do you want to stop right in the middle of this?"</p> <p>"Yes, harder," she whispered. "Do it faster. Faster. I want to feel you inside me."</p> <p>Steve picked up on her cues and increased the pace. His cock was now slamming deeper into her love hole. He was close to blowing his load. He pulled her back by the hair roughly to thrust his cock as far into her as it would go.</p> <p>"Come on you know I love it rough," Steve said, "give it to me. I want to feel you cum all over my cock."</p> <p>The words made her crazy with lust. She felt it building up in her lower body. She came hard as he fucked her pussy harder and faster then ever before. Steve was about to cum. It made him fuck harder against her as she had another huge orgasm. He knew he wouldn't last much longer and started to tense up as well.</p> <p>"You better go slow. I'm almost over. I'm so ready for you," she said, and he was right. He had her right where he wanted her. She needed a good, hard fucking and so was he.</p> <p>Steve flipped her over to her back. He grabbed her legs and bent them at the knees and started to drive her hard back against him. He wanted to have a hard time fucking her in the ass. He loved watching her sphincter muscle bulge with each push. She really loved it. Her whole body moved when he did that. She had a glow on her lips and face as he fucked her as he slammed into her. Her breasts were bouncing back and forth with every drive of his body.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, fuck me. Fuck me." Steve knew his wife wanted it rough at this point. He could feel himself about to blow his load. Her ass pushed back against him as she came again.</p> <p>"Oh, God. Oh shit," Steve screamed as he climaxed. He leaned forward and held her legs together. He kissed her neck and whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Well," he sighed. "Looks like this might be your night. I'm sure you will feel better from now on."</p> <p>Steve pulled out and stood up, still trying to catch his breath. He felt lucky to be with the woman he loved and had loved for years but now needed her to be able to feel happy, confident, and fulfilled. He picked up her clothes, dressed and walked her to the bathroom. He turned on the shower and shut it off. They both stepped out and quickly rinsed off, he grabbed his stuff and said he was getting dressed.</p> <p>"I'll see you tomorrow," he said then kissed her on the lips and they laughed before he walked away. They looked at each other then smiled and kissed again before they went to lay on the bed and fall asleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
