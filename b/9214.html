Ohhhhh"</p> <p>His thrusts became more insistent, and I could feel his pelvis grinding against me repeatedly. I was in heaven.</p> <p>"Fuck me...I'm cumming!!"</p> <p>I reached down and squeezed my own crotch tightly, forcing our combined juices out between our two bodies and coating our lips and faces. My body heaved as I let myself just let it go and felt the contractions of my pussy on the long, hard shaft of his cock.</p> <p>He had never been that deep inside me before. I had never felt that way before. It was beyond belief, the feeling was almost indescribable.</p> <p>We just lay there in each other's arms for several minutes while we recovered from our orgasms.</p> <p>He kissed me on the lips and said "that's one of the wildest experiences of my life."</p> <p>I simply smiled and returned his kiss.</p> <p>He pulled his nightshirt back on and started back towards the living room to retrieve his pants and shorts. "You were great, I need more time with you."</p> <p>"I love you!" I said as I leaned over him.</p> <p>"And I love you," he replied as he gently kissed my lips as we both held each other.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes, he was back downstairs with two more beers. I was feeling light-headed after my recent climax with Mark.</p> <p>"So, did you get anything done with all this going on at the house?" asked Matt.</p> <p>"Nothing went right at the house."</p> <p>"That's because we weren't there to meet her!"</p> <p>"We weren't there to meet her either!" I replied.</p> <p>"That is just between us okay?" he asked with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm just happy for you," I said as I walked back up to him.</p> <p>"I'm proud of you, you're an okay girl," he replied with a kiss.</p> <p>I leaned down and gently kissed his lips as I walked up to him.</p> <p>After we parted, I smiled and gave him a quick kiss on the lips before I put my arms around his neck and pulled him onto me.</p> <p>"I love you too, Mark..."</p> <p>"I love you too, my beautiful daughter," he replied smiling brightly. And, still looking deeply into my eyes, he began to kiss me again. He had not even considered a second kiss.</p> <p>After a moment, I pulled him back towards the sofa and began to kiss his neck. Taking his earlobe between my teeth, I gently sucked on it as he continued to kiss me.</p> <p>We were on our sides in a soft embrace, looking deeply into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"Would you like to go upstairs?" he finally asked.</p> <p>"We're going to have too much fun now."</p> <p>He grinned widely.</p> <p>We got up, and I threw my overnight bag down on the couch, followed by the two others in my other bedroom.</p> <p>Mark and I put my bag down on the floor and Matt and I put pillows in the center of the living room next to him.</p> <p>He had the top up on the couch and I got into bed between us as he got in behind me.</p> <p>We were looking into each others eyes while I lay on my side after he got out of bed with the pillows on the couch.</p> <p>He moved his hand to my back and began to start to caress, massage, and then gently squeeze it. We both let out a very contented sigh.</p> <p>I reached over to my nightstand and pulled out our digital camera, setting it up in the corner on the dresser.</p> <p>"I see you're looking at a sexy picture with my mom."</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed him. "I love you so much, Matt," I whispered as I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feeling of having the man of my dreams in bed with me.</p> <p>Mark began to kiss the top of my head as he let his leg slide up next to mine while his hands massaged my back.</p> <p>I turned onto my back and opened my eyes so that I could continue to look into the eyes of Matt from behind as he leaned over and began to softly kiss and nibble my neck. I could feel my nipples harden even more against his chest as he kissed up the back of my neck to my shoulder.</p> <p>His hands slid down the side of my body to my inner thighs. He cupped them and gently squeezed, causing my pussy to twitch and become extremely moist.</p> <p>I wrapped my armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
