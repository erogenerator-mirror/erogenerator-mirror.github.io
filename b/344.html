He said a man can dream. And I was sure that was true. It was a man's desire for sex that got me going. I knew from the many times I had been out in public with other guys that my husband had an unusually large dick. I guess I was beginning to get that "fetish" too. "I think if I were ever going to become completely sexually uninhibited, I would be open to that aspect of myself."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he continued, sitting there with a huge hard on in his pants.</p> <p>"I've always been attracted to men, particularly straight guys."</p> <p>"So what? I'm no problem, I don't think that means anything."</p> <p>His hand found mine and began to massage it. I smiled at him, a sly grin I was beginning to feel. After several weeks of the typical flirtatious banter between boyfriends, we hit it off and started to get closer. But, I told him, "In that case, it's been a while."</p> <p>He smiled, too, and started to kiss me again. This time, he pulled his hand away quickly. I turned back to the computer and began to put things away. I had a hard time deciding what to do. I decided to find out how things could work out. I got up and quietly left the room. I had already found my vibrator. I lay down on my stomach and pulled my knees up to my chest. I spread my legs wide, knowing that this position would show his cock through his pants. When he came back, I told him to put his pants over his cock. I didn't want him to find out that his girlfriend had the same idea.</p> <p>I sat on the bed, looking down at the bed, waiting for him to come back to me. I saw the look of concern cross his face. I could tell he was feeling a little anxious to get to me again. And, that's exactly what I had in mind for him.</p> <p>"Let me give you one good reason to not turn down your offer," I said, and he looked like he was going to cry.</p> <p>"No. I told you, I wouldn't turn down another woman."</p> <p>"No!" I exclaimed, surprised at his denial. "It's just that I don't know how long I'll be able to find someone who could satisfy me."</p> <p>He was still looking at me and I could see the desperation in his eyes. I reached out and rubbed his cheek with the back of my hand. He looked up at me, trying to pull me on top of whatever I was going to do to him. I leaned in and kissed him on the mouth. He responded by returning my kiss.</p> <p>Our tongues danced with each other. His hands were roaming all over my back and ass. My hand moved down his body until it found his cock. It was hard and ready. I couldn't wait much more and took him into my mouth, tasting the salty pre cum there. A deep groan was the only sound that was released after I had been sucking him for several moments. He tried to get up on his knees and put his hands to the back of my head to slow me down.</p> <p>"Fuck me," he said, "I can't wait any longer."</p> <p>I stood up, reached down to my jeans, and took them to get my soaking wet panties off. I stood completely naked in front of him, waiting for him to ask me to do as he said. At this point, I was beginning to really enjoy what he was doing to me. I don't think I would have had to go on the second date any longer if it hadn't been for the fact that we had already made love and it was almost time to get on the road so I could start moving.</p> <p>"On your knees," I ordered him. When he was on his knees, I quickly pulled down my underwear. My cock sprang up free, a sight that I had dreamed and fantasized about. It was hard, straight, and thick. A small drop of precum was running from the tip. I told him to lean forward so that the tip would rub up against his lips that way.</p> <p>He leaned forward, and I felt his warm lips wrap around my head, sucking lightly. I groaned softly at his skillful tongue. I moved my hands down his back. I pulled his hair away from his face and began to suck harder and run my tongue all around his full lips. My dick was pushing against my jeans, and I had to get more of it in my mouth. I kissed his cheek, then his neck.</p> <p>I moved to his ear, gently biting it, then moved farther down. His hands went to my head and moved to my shoulders.
