"So you're one of those little girls that think it was OK to do stuff with me?"</p> <p>She nodded, blushing. "I never did it."</p> <p>"Oh, you never did it?"</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"But then you made me like, you know, lick you – " and he thrust his hips again, harder this time, aching to have his dick inside of her.</p> <p>"But you, you..."</p> <p>"I didn't really let you do it," he replied. "You didn't seem to want it."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>Jill's lips parted.</p> <p>"I mean, I really don't know what I was thinking," the stranger replied. "I was just sort of thinking."</p> <p>"How 'sort of'?" Jill asked.</p> <p>"It was, kind of a little strange but sort of good. But if you hadn't asked before, I don't really know how I'd have done that."</p> <p>Jill felt a flush creep down her neck. "Oh. I'm sorry."</p> <p>The stranger smiled. "Don't worry. I wouldn't have been a liar if I hadn't found you pretty."</p> <p>Jill turned away from him, her hands on her lap. She nodded, then turned back around to face him.</p> <p>"Would you like it if I let you lick me - "</p> <p>"No, of course not," she replied quickly.</p> <p>The stranger nodded, then smiled at her. "Let me show you." He took Jill's hand and placed it on his cock, holding it there.</p> <p>"I think it's pretty nice."</p> <p>Jill let out a small sigh, then leaned forward.</p> <p>It was the most intense kiss she'd ever received. It was soft and wet, and Jill felt the heat of the stranger's lips. Jill ran her tongue all along the back of the stranger's tongue, enjoying the taste of his lips and sweat. His hands gripped her buttocks, lifting her in the air, grinding her against his groin.</p> <p>Jill gasped, then reached inside of his jacket to grip his firm buttocks. She pulled his cock towards her with her fingers, then slowly pushed it against her opening. She felt his warmth envelop hers and she moaned as she sank slowly onto him, feeling his warmth seep into her skin.</p> <p>The stranger grunted, then slowly began to move, pulling Jill backward onto himself. When she was completely impaled, he began to thrust into her with a long, languid rhythm that Jill never thought she would be able to handle.</p> <p>The stranger was clearly aware. He closed his eyes, grunted as he pushed himself deep within her, and then pulled out slowly, pushing her back into the ground.</p> <p>Jill held out against the fence, letting the stranger have what he wanted, only waiting for him to finish it.</p> <p>The stranger kept up the pace, gradually speeding up until the entire length of his cock filled her. He was fucking her hard and fast, groaning and grunting as he slammed his hips into her. Jill felt herself getting weak in the knees, but still felt her lover's cock deep inside of her. Then without warning, he gripped her hips and began to thrust into her hard and fast.</p> <p>Jill felt her clit burn against the fence edge, and knew she was going to come, hard and fast. She wrapped her legs tight around the stranger's waist, urging him faster and deeper.</p> <p>At the same time, Jill felt the stranger's balls slap against her clit. His body tensed, then he moaned deeply and erupted inside of her, sending deep thrusts into her with which Jill could feel herself losing herself.</p> <p>Jill collapsed onto the grass, moaning. She felt the stranger's hand slide around to her abdomen - he ran a finger along her belly to the waistband of her skirt, then gently touched the damp hair that fell over her mound.</p> <p>The stranger's eyes were open now again, and he was breathing slightly harder. He pulled himself up Jill's body, pushing herself back against his rigid member.</p> <p>Jill moaned again, pushing her mound up into the stranger's dick, letting her juices gather around the tip. He began to thrust harder, and Jill began to tremble, but the stranger quickly pulled her body into him, his thrusts turning to a desperate, hard thrust. He grunted in pleasure as his whole body became taut, his muscles tensing—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
