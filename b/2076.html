I look at the man seated with his back against the wall and start to smile. "So I will be your friend soon and you'll have other places to use your cock!"</p> <p>I am stunned by this turn of events. Here? With whom? I think I know but I'm still unsure which one this is?</p> <p>I watch as my cock suddenly pops out of his lap. It's nice and thick. I feel a surge of pride when I look at it. And it was so small! What is it now? I glance back to the man's lap and start to smile.</p> <p>His hand seems to be on the top of his cock. It's growing! It's getting bigger! I can tell he's enjoying himself.</p> <p>I glance over to where the waiter now sits. "Are you enjoying your coffee, honey?" he asks, with a smile over his lips.</p> <p>"Yes, it is very nice!"</p> <p>"I know that. Do you want another cup?"</p> <p>"No I don't think so."</p> <p>"I think you'll need a drink. You're going to have coffee this way!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry honey."</p> <p>"Let him have the cup. You can have it."</p> <p>My cheeks are still red and I can see by the smile on his face that he is proud of me.</p> <p>I look at the waiter as he reaches to take my order. I think about how I am going to serve him again. He's a nice guy and I would not disappoint him. It's going to be nice!</p> <p>We eat and discuss the evening. I'm not sure how much information he needs to share with me before tomorrow, and if he wants to have a cup of joe at the bar. I just try to keep my mind on the conversation. I'm still sitting in front of him. We don't talk for long and soon after the waiter leaves I think he asks me how it's going with him. I tell him I'm doing really good.</p> <p>"Are you going to tell me what's going on?"</p> <p>"We'll see."</p> <p>"Do you think it'll be okay?"</p> <p>"I think it'll be okay. I mean I am going to ask him to stay another night but I'm not sure!"</p> <p>"No he said he'd talk to you."</p> <p>"I don't think this is a problem."</p> <p>"I'm sure you're still not ready."</p> <p>"No I'm not sure but he seems to be enjoying the company of you!"</p> <p>"What?" he says, surprised.</p> <p>"He's only friends with you, now don't you see what you've done to him already? His reputation will probably go down the tubes. Now just keep your eyes on the road!"</p> <p>I watch his face change but he seems to be smiling.</p> <p>I decide I'm going to try him out again and maybe make a quick decision and give him the choice. I glance over at him again and he doesn't seem to notice me looking at him. I decide I'm going to make a move on him. He's pretty much oblivious. I take another sip of coffee.</p> <p>He's sitting there talking. He seems to be making little comments. Maybe he's wondering something funny about me? What could be funny about us talking so casually?</p> <p>I decide to move the conversation on a different course. "Would you like me to get on my knees right outside your door?"</p> <p>He looks toward the door. "Maybe that would be a fine idea."</p> <p>I take another sip of coffee and try to put on more of a confident face.</p> <p>"Now that I'm not feeling guilty or embarrassed and I don't have to be here I'll have to give you that."</p> <p>I lean back. I am ready to get up and go and change. He wants to know what I was thinking? I'm still a little apprehensive but there's no backing out now.</p> <p>"You just wait there, honey."</p> <p>I'm still sitting in front of this stranger. He is staring at me. I smile. It's really nice to have a friendly face and see that guys like you are nice and easy to be with. I'm still sitting in front of him but I have one hand on the bar. He's still sitting between my legs but this time his hand isn't on the seat. He's moving it up and down. I watch him's hand move a little and I know he likes it when I touch him there.</p> <p>"Just go and sit by me."</p> <p>I decide I don't want that and stand up. I follow him to a comfortable couch chair in the corner of the room. He places a chair seat at the table next toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
