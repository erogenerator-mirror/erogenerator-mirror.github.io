She moaned, too, her back arching and I felt her body stiffen and then she let out a long moan as she pressed into me. We layed there for a while with just our breath catching in our chests.</p> <p>"How was that?" she asked, "Was it really that good?"</p> <p>"You know you better than that," I said, "You must hate when other girls do that to you."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, I hate," she said, "Don't you ever do that to me!"</p> <p>"And just who I think I am going to do that to again," I said, "Is how!"</p> <p>It was then that she leaned over to me and kissed me, the first time we had actually kissed that way since we were young on the plane earlier that day. Our tongues rolled and dueled as she pressed herself against me, my cock was hardening again. Her hands were exploring my body; her fingers teased my nipples through my clothing, she was pinching my clit, she was stroking my cock through my pants, and her hips were grinding into me.</p> <p>After many minutes of mutual grinding and kissing, she pulled away and asked, "Can I take your clothes off so we make love now?"</p> <p>"That's a good idea," I said, "Now I want my clothes off you, too."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked.</p> <p>All I could manage at first was a slight nod, "Yup, just a good idea."</p> <p>"Then get this thing off me and get on all fours like you did when we were at the airport," she said.</p> <p>Her words sent shivers down my spine; I never expected that I was about to be the first to "make love" to her. I rolled over, got on all fours; she knelt behind me, opened my pants, and pulled them off. I leaned over the back of the recliner, my ass exposed to her, while I reached back to unzip her dress. She had it down to her midriff before turning over, her tits were perfect and they were on point. She lowered herself and reached under to play with them while I slid off my panties. I then pulled up a couple of pillows so that they were on my stomach and she sat on one of them. Her arms supported her weight above it while my head was in place.</p> <p>My cock was semi-hard so she took it in one hand and began to stroke slowly. I watched as her face contorted in pleasure before a smile broke across her lips and her tongue made a "come here" motion with her mouth.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmm, that's nice," she said, "keep going!"</p> <p>She began to pump my cock while I played with her tits. I loved the feeling of her hand on my cock when she ran her hands up and down in quick little movements. She was stroking me fast and then slowed her pace to a light pace just to give me her time to think. She would move her hand up to stroke my clit and it always was hard enough to drive me insane.</p> <p>She took my cock back in her mouth and worked it and it came back to life. She began to increase the speed and her tongue moved faster while she stroked until she felt me nearing my end. After a few seconds of trying to keep my cock from going numb, she gave it a few strokes and then pulled off, "I want to fuck!" she said lustily.</p> <p>"We are almost done here," I said.</p> <p>"I'm not done you bastard," she said as she turned me over in a 69 position and lowered her cunt onto this cock. I licked and sucked on her pussy to make sure I got everything. I found her clitoris with my tongue and it became erect. I teased it with my tongue, moving up and down and sometimes lightly touching at first and then harder. I was using my fingers to pull on her clit while I fucked her with two finger and her gasping sounds increased as her body stiffened and then stopped. She pushed down harder onto me and moaned several times, her body jerking on top of me. She seemed to get off on something else and I knew it was the end of my night with her.</p> <p>She slid off and slid down the recliner on her back. I moved over, slid off the pillows she had made next to her and she reached and took my cock in her hand. Her head reached for her tits to fondle them and then she slid forward taking my cock into her mouth again. I lay on my back while she worked her mouth up and down the shaft, pulling my cock and her hand gently up and down its length.
