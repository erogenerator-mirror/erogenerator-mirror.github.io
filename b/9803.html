He said, laughing.</p> <p>"Well, thank you. Oh, I've got your drink order right here." She offered, as she came towards his table.</p> <p>"Thanks, so much for inviting me." As Mike held the glass out to her.</p> <p>"It's nothing, just a little thing I have to do to be around you. I'd have to walk back and forth if I didn't have to." She smiled and took the glass before taking a step back.</p> <p>"I'm just going to finish what I've started, ok? I'm about twenty minutes from here."</p> <p>"You're kidding." Amy said, a smile still playing at the corners of her mouth.</p> <p>Mike's face turned red and he excused himself, saying "See ya later."</p> <p>She sat beside him, drinking again as he walked her back to the table. "So, did you really like your drink?" She asked, sitting down to her next to Mike.</p> <p>"Uh huh." Mike replied, almost to himself. "Oh, it's just some kind of cool stuff isn't it?" he smiled.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, that was pretty good." She said, taking a sip of her drink.</p> <p>"Well, good for me." Mike replied. "I guess if I can get to know more about you, I can probably ask you about a lot of stuff." He said, watching the way she was looking at him.</p> <p>"What, do I need to learn what happens to me on a day like this." Amy asked, almost embarrassed to talk to an attractive man like him.</p> <p>"I think you already know a lot now." Mike said, a little surprised as he said this.</p> <p>"Wow, I mean, that's a little surprising." Amy said, now sitting next to him on the opposite side of the table.</p> <p>"Maybe so," Mike replied, smiling and then taking her hand.</p> <p>"Oh, it's nothing." Amy said, surprised and yet pleased that Mike did not try to talk her into going to a bar with him again.</p> <p>Amy got up and took out her purse, opening it and taking out one of Mike's business cards. "Ok, give me your number." She said, handing him her business card.</p> <p>"Well, I don't know how I'll be able to handle it." Mike said, feeling like he was going to burst through the door, if she kept it up.</p> <p>"You can't come up with something so lame. Maybe we can find something in my name and give us more space." Amy stated.</p> <p>"If we don't find anything, I'm not even going to bother telling you where your house is?" Mike asked.</p> <p>"I mean, if you go there, that'd explain the house." Amy said, trying to look as nonchalant as she could. "It's a pretty large lake." Amy added, looking back at Mike.</p> <p>"Yeah, they have a lot of trees here, and they're all pretty nice. I had a feeling you'd like it." Mike said, looking a little more confident.</p> <p>"It's not too bad, huh? Do you have a place on the beach?" Amy asked, looking up from her cup of coffee.</p> <p>"No, it's not too bad. There are a couple of good private beach things to visit here." Mike said, looking over at Amy.</p> <p>"Really? Just someplace where you can go and do anything you want to?" Amy asked.</p> <p>Mike nodded and said "Of course."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know if I can do that." Amy said, thinking she could get him to go to a private beach on her own, even if she didn't like it like he said she did.</p> <p>"Sure you can." Mike said, looking a little taken aback by her suggestion.</p> <p>"Yeah, OK, if you think so," Amy replied. "But thanks, you really do seem like a nice guy." She added, leaning back in her chair a little, her glass perched on the table.</p> <p>Mike saw her eye level with his crotch as he watched her sip her coffee, not bothering to hide it and giving an impish grin.</p> <p>"So, uh, are you coming?" Mike asked, thinking if he talked to her like this, she might go along with it.</p> <p>"Yeah, uh, I'm here. I was hoping you might want to come with me?" Amy said, a sly look crossing her face. "If you don't mind."</p> <p>"How about I get some more coffee before I make a decision." Mike said, smiling and taking his own glass back to his table as she sat next to himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
