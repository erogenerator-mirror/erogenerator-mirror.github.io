I replied. I smiled at her as she sat, I reached across the table and grabbed her hand as she sat.</p> <p>"My, look at you!" I grinned and began the long conversation. "And how long has this been going on for you?"</p> <p>She looked at me with an intrigued look. "I'm sorry, I thought my brother wanted to wait for me? Is that what your brother wants?" She teased, I'm sure she did. I laughed as I reached across the table with my hand.</p> <p>"He already wants me," I said and smiled to her.</p> <p>"Yeah, you're getting some now," she said and gave me a smile as she placed her hand on my leg.</p> <p>"You're very pretty too, aren't you?" I asked and she smiled.</p> <p>Her eyes went wide. "Did I say you could touch me?" she asked giggling.</p> <p>"Oh you don't understand," I replied. "I had to say it when you were in the bathroom," I laughed and she giggled as she sat right back up.</p> <p>"We'll see how you feel when I get back tomorrow," I told her as my hand reached across the table. Her hand was trembling as it laid it on mine. I looked up at her with a smile and she smiled back.</p> <p>"You are so sweet, you know?" I replied. I didn't know what to say except thank you. We kissed again that moment as I pulled her back to me. My hand reached around to the front and felt the buttons of her dress. I felt the zipper and she sat back up again.</p> <p>We broke the kiss and she moved back quickly. I looked at her and I kissed her. We both smiled as her hands went to the buttons of my shirt. In a swift moment, it was off my shoulders and I was naked from the waist up. Her eyes went wide and she sat down on the couch I had just finished.</p> <p>I laughed when she looked at me. "What," I asked her. "I don't think I should go."</p> <p>"You have to stay if you want to," she told me. She looked up at me and smiled. "Do you think your brother would like someone like me, I mean, how long has this been going on for? I mean I'd be more than happy to, it sounds so good." She looked down at me as she spoke. "You're pretty damn handsome too," she said to me.</p> <p>"You shouldn't look down at me, even with everything that's gonna happen," I told her. She laughed and I leaned into her kiss.</p> <p>"You're still a girl," she said and we finished. "What are you thinking about?" she asked. I reached under her dress and felt for her pussy. There were wet spots on her panties and she let me feel for herself for a minute before her lips separated from mine. I looked at her again and I nodded. "You're really beautiful," I told her. She smiled and pulled me back down on the couch to kiss her again. I watched her and we had a very long kiss on the couch. We broke the kiss and she looked at me again.</p> <p>"I guess we should get to know each other," she said. She lifted her dress over her head and looked at me. I looked down at her and smiled.</p> <p>"I just want us to get to know each other," I told her. "I think that's about all I should say now, ok?" I laughed as she smiled and sat back to kiss me again.</p> <p>I pulled up her skirt so I could see how much she had shaved down there. She lifted her legs up so I could see. "Oh my," she said and laughed and touched me. Her fingers were cool and soft like her other skin. It felt different inside there, very warm and moist.</p> <p>I pushed her legs up so my finger could find her wetness. When I touched her, she pushed back against my finger.</p> <p>"What you have is beautiful," I said as I took her hand into mine. We kissed again as my fingers slowly worked in her and her fingers held mine.</p> <p>"How do you do that," she asked as she squeezed my penis.</p> <p>"I have some secrets," I told her. "They're not good secrets, ok?" she asked.</p> <p>"You don't need to tell me your secrets," I told her and she gave me a big smile. It made my fingers even better.</p> <p>We kissed as we stroked each others' bodies. I kissed her neck while my other hand cupped her breast and my fingers tweaked her nipple again. I kissed her once moreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
