Did you two have a good time?" I ask.</p> <p>"Oh yes! Oh yes! She loved it. And yes the guys were right...that girl did need some cheering up, right?"</p> <p>"That would be her, but you'd know that by then."</p> <p>That night, we were watching a chick movie that I wanted to see. I didn't get to see much of it, and when we got back to her place and got the TV on, it was apparent that the girl on screen was being used.</p> <p>"Did you mean it when you said that you wanted to fuck her?"</p> <p>"What do you think?"</p> <p>"What? What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, the movie does have some interesting content, and I thought that a good time wouldn't hurt. We'll see what happens, though. And I said that I was just having some fun anyway."</p> <p>"Are you complaining that I've been having a good time?"</p> <p>"What do you have in mind?" She asked me.</p> <p>"Come on. I don't think you want to hear it. You just wanted to know. Okay, then, you need to get into your mood. Let's see what happens."</p> <p>"Okay, but what about you?"</p> <p>"Just watch the movie and leave it there. I'll show you next time."</p> <p>I did see her in a couple of scenes as I watched the movie, but I was sure it was just one scene. That made one movie to watch that night, but she was definitely into it now. The chick flick had her moaning and squealing all over the place.</p> <p>I got the TV out and began to play some music, as it had just started playing on the TV. I put a couple of songs in the album I'd gotten some time before. The chick flick had a hot scene, in which a guy was jerking off a girl. I'd played back the other songs to try to get them worked in the time ahead.</p> <p>The girls found the scene again about a few minutes into the movie, while I watched. The girl had been tied up from waist down and had her tits tied together. Her tits were the size of my head, the kind that could stay in a bucket of water. I thought that I'd just had the best sex of my life with that chick, and now I was sure that we had at least three more to come.</p> <p>"Oh, that was nice," I said. "It was fun watching her, though. I have to admit that I was kind of hoping that you had the same effect that you did on us, too. It sure was fun doing it with you." I said that after thinking about seeing her.</p> <p>"And I was too. We're even now." I think that she said that she was glad that the whole thing was over, but I still had thoughts of her when I made her cum. She seemed to be thinking about it while she watched the movie.</p> <p>We continued to play with the chicks we'd been playing with until we decided that our playtime with each other had gone out of the window. We got up and kissed each other. She had to stand there for a long while as we kissed.</p> <p>"Did I really let you do it?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Hm? Oh yes!" I said while we embraced.</p> <p>"And how did you feel about doing it with another woman?" she asked me.</p> <p>"It was very interesting at first, but then I started wishing that I had the chance to do it."</p> <p>"And did you find it all to you?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I guess I did. But it wasn't like last time, but more than a little exciting. But we're not going to do it again."</p> <p>"Oh, I know. I don't want us to do it again. You and I have fun."</p> <p>"Yeah. I was surprised, though." I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know. I just never imagined doing it like that."</p> <p>"You sure never imagined anything when you did it with me. Oh, you are different from the guy that I've known for twenty years. You're so different."</p> <p>I thought back to what I thought was going on with my best friends and how much I missed her. I had always thought that I could be alone with her, and now...that is different.</p> <p>"Well, I've never been with someone as beautiful as you.
