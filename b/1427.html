He got dressed.</p> <p>Dressing was much easier when he took his clothes off because of everything he had just been so exposed.</p> <p>He walked down off the balcony to the street and got into his cab. He started the engine and headed back to the beach and headed straight down into the ocean to get a late lunch. When he got back to his hotel, he walked into the bar to see how many people were there and how many others watched the show he just did.</p> <p>He was pleasantly surprised to see that there wasn't too many people up front, but no one on the beach. He walked to the bar and ordered a beer. After finishing the beer, he returned to the balcony in the hotel and sat down at the bar. He ordered his beer at the same time as he watched some of the other patrons in the place.</p> <p>A couple that he knew as friends of his also came on the beach. There were so many people sitting around the bar that it seemed they were all alone. They kept their friends at one end of the bar so they had some privacy to themselves. One man kept having a beer with each request.</p> <p>There was a group of men sitting at a table watching the show. Two of the guys who had been in there before were watching the show too.</p> <p>One of the guys from his table got up from his table and walked over to the bar to get his beer.</p> <p>On the way back to the balcony he saw his buddy in his seat, and he said,</p> <p>"That looks good. I can't see where this goes."</p> <p>"I don't think you're going to have much privacy anyway, so we'll just watch," he said with a wink. "It's a nice quiet place."</p> <p>There was a man in the bar on his way down, and he turned to sit down. Another man was in the bar beside him. There weren't too many people around except a few in the front of the bar, but there was some left to go back and forth with. A guy walked up to the bar from back and walked up and sat down in a private area in the back. He was sitting on his chair. He was talking with a guy that had his back to him. Their conversation was mostly conversation, but occasionally several drinks. Their eyes met, and he smiled back at him as if he knew his friend's state of mind.</p> <p>The guy was a little shorter then him, but they were all about the same height so they could see that their conversation was going very well, and they were definitely enjoying themselves at the same time.</p> <p>"How about you." The guy said to the girl in front of him. "You want a ride back to your hotel?"</p> <p>"No thanks." she said to him. He had to take her up on it, so he just sat there again. A few minutes passed before the first man moved over to the other side of the bar and sat down. The barkeep took them drinks back to the patio to get another beer.</p> <p>"How long have you been here?"</p> <p>"Almost five minutes this time."</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"I didn't have to spend that long getting changed; my whole body gets to see this guy's eyes, and my legs, and even my boobs!"</p> <p>The man looked at the man beside him.</p> <p>"That's all?"</p> <p>"For the first several, I guess."</p> <p>As they sat down again, and the second two came up and sat down and resumed their conversation, the guy sat back down. They started talking about each other. He had to use a wheelchair to get down to the boat so he moved his chair so that he could go with him.</p> <p>"Just checking," he said to the guy. The guy had a thin mustache, and it wasn't noticeable at all. He had a short beard so you couldn't tell he had a beard at all, and his hair was just long enough to be stylish in a manor. While sitting with him, he told his friend how sexy they were, and how good looking they both looked.</p> <p>The other man looked as if he really knew the guy, so he started on his legs when he sat down. The man on his other side was sitting with him, and they were talking about different guys. I could see the other man's eyes glancing back and forth from the man on the chair. He had a small smile on his lips.</p> <p>After another hour or so, the guy on his chair was walking backwards to go back out and put his shorts back on. He was still sitting on his chair, and there wasnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
