Lisa gasped as a powerful orgasm rippled through her.</p> <p>His cock thrust into her again and again, deeper and deeper. "Ahh!" he grunted, "Oh yes! Yeah!" he told her.</p> <p>Lisa's legs were trembling as she clutched at Paul's ass and her own body convulsed, releasing her own hot fluids all over his cock and balls.</p> <p>Paul was not far behind, his own climax nearing. He held himself deep inside her while his own body tightened and froze as a huge load of cum shot from his cock and deep into her vagina. He froze and pulled on her arm and pulled her back against his chest as his penis continued to throb and swell. He leaned back as she held on to his hip, the motion of his cock making his balls tingle. As she felt the pulses of their mutual love wash over every pore of her body, her legs relaxed but she still felt a strange sense of sexual satisfaction. She smiled to herself as she remembered the sensation of taking his cock into her vagina while he had blown into her mouth and then, back onto his cock again and again.</p> <p>His own climax seemed to be reaching its completion after a few moments of stillness. He looked up at her flushed face and saw her body covered with sweat with her eyes closed and her lips parted. "Lisa," he spoke softly, "I'm sorry if that happened, it was so..."</p> <p>"Oh, Paul, don't say anything," she spoke, sliding out from beneath him. "I guess I'm not a natural exhibitionist," she laughed. "Besides, if you like the sex I have, you're going to love the variety," she added looking his face. "Now get up, it's time to clean up," she told him smiling.</p> <p>Picking up the towel he wrapped himself around himself, Paul washed himself off, dried his brow.</p> <p>"Do you think I know you from somewhere?" he asked her.</p> <p>Lisa, still in a somewhat drowsy state, nodded her head. "Yes," she answered.</p> <p>"Will you come to my house with me?" he asked her.</p> <p>She smiled and shook her head. "No," she said softly.</p> <p>"I'll pick you up tomorrow night at seven." He handed her a cup of coffee then walked her to the door and told her she was welcome home anytime, and that he'd take care of anything she might need. "Thank you, Lisa," he called back to her. He gave her a thumbs up sign as he pulled his clothes on and locked his front door.</p> <p>"Can I ask you a question?" she asked as he closed and locked his front door.</p> <p>"Sure," he answered. "Anything."</p> <p>"When we were just having sex, you were acting as if you were the one who should be punished."</p> <p>"Well, I wasn't the one who should be doing the fucking." He kissed her on the lips gently. "I'm just the one who should be," he continued with a smirk. "And that's a really good thing." He looked over at the clock and saw it was almost six in the morning. "Wow, that's a bit early. How late do you have to get up to get ready?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Don't be stupid," she said. "I'll pick you up tomorrow nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
