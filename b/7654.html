The back of her robe fell open, revealing the bottom of her firm round ass, with her legs together and the tops of her stockings running over them. She pushed her bottom against her student. They kissed deeply, feeling their chests pressed against each other.</p> <p>He put his hand on top of hers as they kissed. She squeezed it. "I've never done it that way before," he confessed. "It's not like we have sex."</p> <p>"It is, and it feels great," she moaned.</p> <p>"Good," he said.</p> <p>They hugged tightly. She rubbed his crotch. "Can I do this?" she asked.</p> <p>"You can, but you have to come back," he replied. "I will be back when you're ready. Just let me know when you're ready."</p> <p>Lights came on, but she didn't realize it. She was naked in front of this handsome man and as aroused as he was. It would be easier to be horny if she looked like this.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm ready. I'll come back," she agreed.</p> <p>He got dressed. "Thanks, sweetheart," he said. "Don't forget our anniversary next week."</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>The doorbell rang and he opened the door to let it in. "Oh, sorry, we have a guest," he said as he stood at the door. "Come in. It's the dean of the college."</p> <p>"Oh, right." He entered the hallway. A small, dark-haired woman, probably in her late 20s or early 30s, was standing in the middle of the hallway.</p> <p>"Nice to meet you, Sir," she said. "Nice to finally meet you," she added, with a smile.</p> <p>"Well, if the dean isn't going to be here," he said, "I'm sure he'll be here later. Let's not be late again."</p> <p>Her shoulders sagged. "I'm sure..." she started to say.</p> <p>He put his hand on hers. "Shhh," he whispered to her. "It's really important."</p> <p>His hand was strong. "My name is John by the way," he said, as he reached for her hand and placed it back on the door.</p> <p>"My name is Amy," she whispered back. "How may I..." she trailed off, before he reached his hand up to her upper chest.</p> <p>She was feeling hot, but also very turned on. She reached up with her hands and stroked his cheeks. She felt his muscles under his clothes.</p> <p>"Let's go," he whispered. "I really do love this outfit." He walked the rest of the way up the front stairs, leaving her standing in the front door, wondering why he was suddenly there. It had been years since he had a visitor, especially not after such a long time.</p> <p>John took her hand. "Follow me," he said as he led her down the center hallway of the house. He led her up a dark stairwell. Her heart beat fast as he unlocked the door to her room. The light from the hallway illuminated her beautiful figure, as if in a mirror.</p> <p>He led her down the hallway, pulling her behind him like a doll in his arms. She felt a pang of regret as she took a deep breath, resisting the urge to close her eyes.</p> <p>They reached her room and he unlocked the door, turning towards her as she closed hers.</p> <p>"I didn't have any idea what to do in my life," she said quietly. "I'm so happy to be here. I'm sorry that I didn't go with some of my friends."</p> <p>She dropped to her knees and started to undo the buttons of her dress as he helped her unbutton it. Once she had it unbuttoned, he stepped back and opened his zipper. They walked away from each other, not speaking for a while.</p> <p>He reached down to caress her breast. "You really are very sexy," he said as he fondled it. "I can't wait to see it."</p> <p>She had stopped unbuttoning her dress when she stood up and walked behind him. She pushed her soft, warm body up against his back as they continued out of the room. He ran his hands all over her body.</p> <p>She felt like a queen standing before him. She hadn't been naked in years, not since college. "Your housemate is so hot," she thought to herself as she felt his hands roam her body. She was so nervous and excited, having never been naked in this man's arms. She felt his hands reach under her arms and lift her up off the ground.
