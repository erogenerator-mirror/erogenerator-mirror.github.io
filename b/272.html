My heart raced with anticipation of what would happen but all of a sudden, I felt that all at once, the anticipation was fading. As I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, I was suddenly shocked and overwhelmed with my desire to feel a man's hands on me. I let my eyes snap away from the screen, my mind racing with the thought of whether it was right or not, what was left of my mind. Just when I knew I had made the decision, my imagination was running wild, my pulse racing and my cock so hard I thought I was at my limit.</p> <p>My heart was now racing out of my chest as I tried to make sense of all of this. This is exactly the kind of attention I was going to get. As I opened my eyes to stare into the bright light of his camera I heard his reply. "You want me to take a picture, you're gonna love it!" I felt my pulse quicken as his words took hold of me.</p> <p>"I know that you want to do that" I said a little too quickly. I let my eyes roam his body to his hands as he said, "Just relax and enjoy" and clicked the button to pause the film.</p> <p>"I know," said my mind. I felt my heart leap at that first touch on my body. His touch felt so smooth and hot, I could practically feel his fingers gently caressing the skin all around my shoulders and upper arms. I could feel a shiver and a shiver at the same time and my breathing became heavier. The thought that a man's hands were touching me was intoxicating and the feeling was so incredibly hot and erotic, I could feel the dampness between my legs spreading over my panties. I watched the screen as my cock grew so hard it was like a steel rod, and in my mind, I watched as the tip of his finger slipped underneath and gently caressed my nipple until the nipple began to harden under his touch. I could feel my pulse racing and my breathing becoming ragged. My lips fell open and I inhaled sharply through my nose at his touch. He was kissing me there, not in a tender kind of way, but in a rough and forceful way that would get me wet and ready for whatever would happen next. And, his hands were so warm on my body that I was sure I was going to melt away from the sensual caresses he was giving me.</p> <p>"Oh my god, I want you to do that! I want you to touch me there!" I was breathing heavily and my heart beat was beating so fast I could barely hear it, as I watched myself in his lens. His finger brushed and pressed the fabric of my blouse against the outside of my breasts, as if to tease the sensitive flesh. I inhaled sharply and my hands dropped down from my neck to my waist and began to unbuttoning and unzipping the buttons on my blouse, trying to hold back the rush of desire that built up within me. My breathing was becoming heavy and my heart was pounding. My eyes had just stopped swimming when I realized the film had stopped. I looked at the screen but wasn't able to find his body language. It was almost as if his words and the feel of his fingers were too much for me to watch, so I sat stunned on the couch, my mind a million thoughts buzzing around.</p> <p>And just as the movie was getting to the point where I could feel my body getting hard again, a look of horror crossed my face when a hot flush went through my body, "Oh my god!" I couldn't hold back any longer. I lifted the hem of my skirt in one smooth motion, feeling the heat rise to my cheeks.</p> <p>"No" I said in a shaky attempt to save a shred of dignity. I turned my head, hoping that he could not see what I was preparing to do to him. But instead, there was a sudden silence as I turned my face to face him. He looked up at my face and with a wide smile, said "No." Again his eyes looked at the screen and I couldn't help to watch what seemed like a lifetime of his eyes, not believing that those eyes could be so big! "No" I said again in what I hoped would be a cute and sexy tone.</p> <p>"No?" said his voice again. "I think this is going to be better than last time." He replied, his voice sounding like he was talking through a microphone in his hand.</p> <p>Now, I was truly confused. I thought this was the end of my experience. I tried for the first time to fight it, but he didn't seem to care. "No," I said again. "I think this may have ruined everything..." I said as my heart was racing, trying to come to terms with what I said.</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry, babeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
