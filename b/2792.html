As I continued her hands began to unbutton my shirt and slid it off. I slipped my boxers down and I held her head and neck as I continued the kiss; her nipples were hard and sensitive as my fingers worked to get her bra straps undone. As her bra came free she reached around to unhook my pants with one hand; before I was able to get them out of the way she was able to slide my shorts and panties off, leaving me completely naked. She began rubbing my cock through my boxers, making sure it was hard and pointing upwards.</p> <p>"I love how sensitive it is right where it is", I exclaimed and we continued.</p> <p>She began to kiss my stomach as she continued working at my boxers. I pulled back slightly to make sure she looked at my manhood and then she began working on the front of my boxers. Slowly, with each movement, she drew the elastic down to the bottom of the elastic band. I could feel the moisture on the head of my cock and it soon became engorged and hard with need. She continued to rub the base of my cock with one hand and gently stroked me with the other. I was in heaven.</p> <p>She raised her head and kissed my cock as she looked at it.</p> <p>I was fully erect now and I felt her lips touch the head. My hands came up to caress her large breasts; as she was now sliding my boxers down. I could feel her warm breath as she took my cock into her warm, wet mouth. The feeling of her warm wet mouth sent thrills through me. She began to slowly move her head up and down my cock, taking more and more of me into her mouth with each movement. My hips moved slightly at the sensation and she began to make a humming sound with each stroke. I began to feel a tightening in my balls, it was building and I knew that I was about to release.</p> <p>"I want to feel your cum in my mouth".</p> <p>She smiled and rose to her feet, letting me kiss her as we kissed. I felt the cum rise and I knew it was going to be very good. I reached down to feel the wetness on my cock as she moved towards me for a kiss. I could feel her fingers, slick with her saliva rubbing the head of my cock as she put her mouth to it and pressed her lips to me. She began to suck and pull me out until just the head was in and then she slowly and sensually moved over the head, taking me deeply and slowly again, she would push a little further, stopping and then sucking the head, as she slowly slid the tip of my cock into the warmth that was waiting for it. A large wet spot appeared at the base of my cock as I felt the wetness. I held her head and she took me into her mouth a bit more of me and then let me slide out just a little.</p> <p>"God you're so good" I moaned as I looked down into her eyes.</p> <p>We kissed and tongued and finally we were done. She stood up and turned to return to the bed where we embraced and kissed. It was a tender but sensual kiss. Our bodies slid back into the bed and I held her tightly.</p> <p>"Thank you", we said in unison.</p> <p>It was about 2 minutes later when I began to hear her crying again so I felt her hand on my cock, stroking and stroking. I rolled onto my back and looked at her.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry" I whispered.</p> <p>"Don't be" she said. "It's ok"</p> <p>She looked down at my cock and moved her panties to the side, taking it completely into her and began to rub herself up and down, taking me in her hand and taking it all the way out.</p> <p>"God, I love your cock", she whispered back.</p> <p>"I know you do, its beautiful"</p> <p>She smiled and began to stroke me again as she stood up on her toes and slipped the panties to the side. The aroma of the cum on my cock began to fill the entire room with more and more desire. I could see it in her eyes as she held my cock between her legs with one hand and slowly began to rub her clitoris with the other. Her eyes closed and her head rolled back as she began to moan with sheer pleasure and release as she fingered herself slowly, rubbing all around her clit.</p> <p>"Oh God" she whispered and began to moan again as she slipped two fingers into her tight pussy, sliding them in and out, as she stroked the shaft of myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
