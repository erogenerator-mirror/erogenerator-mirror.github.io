I kissed her long, hard and very aggressively. She pushed me back a bit and began kissing my neck and ears again, lightly nibbling on the skin there, making me sigh in pleasurable ecstasy. She put one hand on my shoulders to steady herself as she kissed her way down to my neck and collarbone. When she reached my breasts she sucked gently on each of them through my shirt. I started to moan and then groan as she brought her mouth back up the length of my left nipple.</p> <p>The sensation of her tongue and teeth and lips on my tit brought me over the edge. It was the first time I'd ever felt a woman make me cum. I felt her finger slip up from my breast and start to lightly rub my clit. She took the nipple between her teeth as her finger went back to work on my clit. It didn't take long for me to cum. She kept her finger on my clit for a full five minutes, using it to rub my G-spot.</p> <p>As I recovered from my orgasm I heard myself softly moaning, "Mmm, oh yes, yes...." It came out as an excited whimper. I didn't want to tell her that I'd never had sex before, but I had. This is exactly what happened when I read about oral sex.</p> <p>"Oh, God! I never knew that I could be so turned on by it!" I said. "I thought I may've never finished," I said as I lay down on the bed.</p> <p>"You just surprised me," she said with a devilish grin. "Now, put some clothes on."</p> <p>I just smiled at her and began unbuttoning my shirt. It was still a little dry, but I was so excited by the prospect of having sex with a woman who could please me as well as my husband. I quickly pulled my shorts back on, zipped up and began getting dressed.</p> <p>As I went through my clothes there was a knock at the door. I looked around the room, wondering whether to just take it and leave. It seemed too weird and too crazy for that. This was something I had a vague feeling that I never wanted to do again. But I hoped that she had a good time or that I might meet a nice guy she liked on a regular basis.</p> <p>"Holly?"</p> <p>"I'm ready to go. Are you?"</p> <p>I looked at the clock on the wall. It was two in the morning.</p> <p>"Yeah. Let's go."</p> <p>It took us about five minutes to get to where we were going: a nice, quiet but pretty dark corner. A few minutes after we'd dropped the bags at the front door, it got quiet again. We made out for a while and then she pulled me back to our hotel room. She had me lay down on the bed. I was still wearing the shirt, but it felt good being fresh out of it. She turned down the lights and then lit a small candle, which she handed to me so I could get the idea it would be nice. She kissed me again and I was overwhelmed with the feeling. I had never been with a woman before. I felt so out of place.</p> <p>She began kissing down my neck again, moving towards the tops of my breasts. She softly circled and flicked my nipples with her tongue. I reached down and touched her thigh again but still made no move to pull her down so she could finish the job on her own.</p> <p>After a minute or so, she was up me to her knees. I lifted my legs a bit to allow her access and she kissed her way down over my pussy and between my legs. I felt her tongue run right across my clit. It felt electric. It made me feel like I could come very hard. She licked and sucked with a passion I had never encountered before. She was doing all the right things at the right moment, making me climax like I hadn't ever climaxed before. She didn't even make a sound; she was going to make me feel it.</p> <p>"Oh my god," I moaned. "That feels so good. I'm so...so excited."</p> <p>She smiled and returned to her previous position. Her tongue made slow, long laps around my pussy. It was driving me wild. I closed my eyes and began moaning my approval. She smiled too and went back to the work of licking my clit. First it was hard and erect, then the hood, and finally it's hard, big, throbbing, pink nub. Her tongue did magical things to it it. She went back to giving me a nice, slow and deep licks. It was like a fire in my pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
