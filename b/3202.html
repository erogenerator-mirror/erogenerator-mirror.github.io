"I'm sorry. I wanted to get back in the mood so that I could finish what we have been going on." She looked up to him and smiled sweetly before kissing down his cheek and nibbling his earlobe.</p> <p>Mark could be patient. He pushed her away again. "No, I'm sorry. I should probably get back down to finish what we started," he said, looking into her beautiful, blue eyes. She giggled and wiggled her ass at him again. "I'm not used to getting kissed like that, but thank you. The best kiss I ever got," He said with a big grin.</p> <p>"You're not too bad yourself," She responded, pushing away from him once more. "I think that I should get back to our room now, huh? I thought that you're leaving soon." She reached over and grabbed a couple of towels from the rack to dry her face.</p> <p>"I told you to stay in bed," he replied, watching her intently, taking in the full sight of her body. "I'll help you with the bathroom before you leave," He told her. "Take off everything that you are wearing." He warned her, pointing towards a door in the back of the cabin.</p> <p>She walked into the bathroom in silence, looking back at him as he came from the bathroom. "It's okay," She said, moving in behind him as he stood in front of the toilet. She reached her hands around his body, pulling him towards her against his naked skin. A long sigh escaped from Mark's lips. He knew it wasn't working. She felt so right against him. A soft sigh left hiss as he felt his cock spring to life again.</p> <p>"Turn around, Mark," she told him. He turned around, facing her again. His cock twitched as it rose toward her. A gentle nudge and he felt as it slid home with a quick thud.</p> <p>"Oh, shit," he exclaimed, looking down at his hands.</p> <p>"Don't worry," She said, standing and grabbing him by the hand, leading him down the hall. She had a feeling that Mark wasn't going to be able to keep his end of the bargain and they were all going to have to do what he said, right now.</p> <p>She sat down on the toilet when he made it. He stood in front of her as she took turns soaping him. Once clean, she washed his face and face and chest then rinsed them with the warm cloth. In the bathroom she turned on the water, making sure that the temperature was correct before returning to her position behind him. Mark couldn't keep his hands from roving over her body. She was so gorgeous, yet she could also be a total whiner about him. He wasn't sure what to do with himself right now, so he decided to just watch her for a while. She smiled at him and ran the water over his body. It felt good to have him washing her again. She reached around to cup his balls in her hand, gently massaging them as she bent over to soap him from the back. As she bent over, Mark's eyes roamed over her soft curves and up her body. Her skin was almost as smooth as if she was a silk that was made for being washed. He watched in fascination as she soaped him slowly and moved her hands to his hips and chest, moving them forward so that he could feel the softness of her back. He leaned across her, looking back at her as she washed him. She turned her attention back to the task at hand.</p> <p>"Can I see what the little bitch in the cabron thinks she's done," he said, his tone clear. She stepped closer and put her hand on his shoulder for balance. He turned in to watch as she looked back over her shoulder at him. Her body looked as magnificent against him as his cock throbbed in her hand. She reached her hands up to grasp his dick but stopped there when she felt him harden against her back.</p> <p>"Uh-huh," she murmured. Her head dropped back, closing her eyes as she let the sensation of the washing wash over her body. She pushed him back. "Get out of the water," she breathed, turning away from him again. Mark was taken aback by her movement, but he quickly realized that she wasn't going to give him the excuse of turning around.</p> <p>"No," he said, turning off the water. "I want you to turn around," He instructed her, watching her lean forward again. She turned slowly away from him and reached up and pulled the top of her shirt off, revealing the gorgeous body of a young woman.
