Yes! Yes!" she cried out, as her body shook and convulsed. Her pussy juices were running down her legs. Her hands flailed about as they reached out for the nearest thing.</p> <p>My fingers were coated with her juices, and all I could do was lick them off as their lips and tongues continued to dance across each other's mouths. She was breathing so hard from the orgasm she had just had and it had taken everything I had not to rip the cloth from her head. It must have been an hour later when I heard her voice asking if I would let her sleep.</p> <p>I just sat there, looking at her as her eyes closed and she began to drift off to sleep. I decided to do something about that too... and so I got up went to the bathroom. I got up to shower and came back a moment later to see she was just lying on the bed. I gently took the cloth from my hand and rubbed some of her juices across her face to wake her up.</p> <p>She woke up with that sleepy look in her eyes. She said, "Oh! Thank you so very much."</p> <p>"My pleasure," I answered.</p> <p>"Now you have to show me what you have done to me," she said as she reached out for my cock. A second later she had it in her hand.</p> <p>"Mmmm yes! I want to fuck you so much!" she said as her lips met mine and her tongue found my tongue. "But you can only cum once," was her explanation.</p> <p>"Yeah!" I said, "And now I want to fuck you so bad!"</p> <p>"Don't you want to?" she said. I guess I'd have been too stupid to realize what she meant.</p> <p>"Do... do you love me?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied simply.</p> <p>I wanted her so bad.</p> <p>"Will you... give me pleasure?" I said as I looked up into her eyes.</p> <p>"No honey," she said, "You'll see."</p> <p>As I climbed onto the bed next to Julie she took my cock in her hand and guided it to her mouth. She gently held it there, not moving it, allowing the head to penetrate her mouth. It was as if a switch went off in her head... when it hit her it seemed like something was changed.</p> <p>My cock had never felt so good in her mouth. It had always been very pleasurable to me when I had been with a woman and she always seemed to like it. Now the sensation was different, it felt harder and longer to her touch but the sensation from her lips on it... she was sucking it so wonderfully.</p> <p>As I kissed her neck, her hands pulled my head tighter against her body and began to run down my chest and abdomen. Her tongue was flicking the head of my cock as she licked it. Her mouth was so soft, the feeling that she so willingly and obediently gave to me was beyond any expectation that I had felt.</p> <p>After a few moments of that, she pulled away from my cock and said, "Come closer so I can suck you," again she said.</p> <p>When I reached her, she stood up and guided me to the bed. Once I was there she pushed me back and then began kissing me again, this time more forcefully. She rubbed her soft skin-clad breasts against mine. She rubbed her face against mine, and it sent signals to the rest of her body. She kissed me softly, running her tongue along my lips and face as our tongues danced. Her body was soft and warm against me, it felt strange, almost as if it had a life of its own.</p> <p>She finally pulled away from the kiss and told me, "I want you to make love to me. Please," after a few moments of that she lowered herself down. She held my cock to her abdomen, and I just laid back.</p> <p>It was a few seconds before I felt her lips wrap around the head of my cock. It felt so wonderful it took on a life of its own. It felt so good it felt real. I knew I wouldn't last long and there wasn't a thing I could say I didn't feel right about it. In a matter of moments I knew I wouldn't last long. As I had said earlier I had never been with a woman before and that was amazing to me. She slowly took all of me into her mouth, the head of my cock completely in her mouth, her lips tightly around it. She pulled her mouth off of me with a loud smack and asked me to turn over so she could suck me again.</p> <p>"But I'd like to, too," I said as I was getting anxious about what would come next.</p> <p>"Pleaseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
