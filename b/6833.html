"Well, I'm off to bed and I'm not asleep yet, either." She grabbed my arm and walked with me. I followed a moment later. The kitchen was large and smelled of coffee brewing. "What are you doing here?" I asked after a quick hug for her.</p> <p>"Just helping you out. I'm so happy you're not working tonight." It was true. She was so busy right now for my benefit. She was going to have to leave in two hours of my absence. She could work more often if I were to stay.</p> <p>"Thanks for that, I appreciate you doing too." We entered the kitchen and sat down. My eyes were on her ass and thighs as we sat talking. "I'm happy to be home, but I don't want you in this room," she said. "Let me get you a beer. "</p> <p>Her arm was wrapped around my back and her hand was on my thigh. "You know you're welcome to come too. If you're not feeling well, maybe I should go to sleep myself."</p> <p>To my surprise, she wasn't talking. It was so late in the night that I felt like a baby in the presence of such a lovely woman. I watched as she went back to make our drinks. When she returned, and sat down on the couch opposite me, she turned on the lamp next to her. "I heard the shower running."</p> <p>"Oh, I almost forgot about that. Did I wake you up?"</p> <p>"Yes, I thought so. The other one doesn't start until 7:00 a.m.," she said as she reached over and kissed me on the lips. I was very aware that she was wearing a long silk robe, which felt really good on her skin. "I was starting to get thirsty, so let me get you some more beer."</p> <p>As she got back into her seat, I took another sip and turned to give her more of my attention. She smiled and said, "That's nice. I'm glad you came." I smiled back, and she leaned back into the couch next to me. "I'm sure I'm going to have one too soon." She laughed and I laughed back. She looked at me, but said nothing. I took another sip of my beer and watched her closely. She was not wearing a robe and I could see where her legs got tangled up and she must have had too many to sit in the bed. "We've got time, maybe we can get to know each other a little more?" She looked even more beautiful that night. She was wearing a red silk, knee length nightgown. The material clung to her body and hid very little of her. I looked and couldn't believe I was looking at her. I had always fantasized about going to bed with her. She turned to face me and kissed me. "Thank you for sharing me with you, but you should have seen the look on your face. We're going to have a very interesting evening."</p> <p>"We're going to have a nice evening, too. Let's go to bed," I said, taking a long sip of my beer and watching her. She smiled at me. "I bet you've been going to bed thinking about me," she said as she slid to the floor, pulling me by the waistband of my shorts. She took my hand and led me with her toward the door. She pulled me along and kissed me again. She was making little mewling sounds as her arms went around my neck. It was a very good night for a first kiss indeed.</p> <p>This was the first time in my life to get my cock into somebody's mouth. I liked it and I hoped we could do it again tomorrow. I liked it too, but I had no intention of letting her anywhere to go. She pushed me over onto my back, straddling me with her legs. She began kissing me again and I felt myself getting wet as we did. As she kissed her way down my neck and shoulders, her hand began sliding up to grab my cock. I was really turned on.</p> <p>"Let me turn this around and you fuck me," she said, leading me out the door and on the couch. We sat next to each other in the recliner and she took some lube from her purse. She slid down my body, sliding it up and down my shaft. It felt wonderful to be with her again. She started a slow slide up and down me and used both hands to stimulate me. It felt so wonderful. The feel of her hands on my cock gave me a little jolt. She kissed me again as she worked herself down my cock. Her lips on my chin and the top of my neck were delightful to do. She was working herself to an almost motionless orgasm and I watched intently.</p> <p>Her hipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
