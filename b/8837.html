My head was swimming with lust, a feeling similar to that that I had felt when I'd first gotten dressed up. I was desperate to push the thoughts out of my mind, not wanting to bring them into the reality of the moment.</p> <p>I turned to face him, and I saw his face was flushed, his breath heavy with desire. "I don't have a condom. I have to feel you inside me, to feel you come in me," I said with a husky tone. "I need you in as much as you're inside me."</p> <p>"You're so wet already," he said, his breath hot on my neck. "I'm not going to waste this on condoms."</p> <p>"It's worth a try," I said, and I got to my knees on the bed and pressed him back down on the bed. Our bodies were so close now, and we ground against each other with one of our hips. I ran two fingers through his hair, kissing his face, his neck, his chest. I was almost afraid that I would feel his heartbeat, for he was so hot in my hands.</p> <p>"I'm gonna make you cum," I told him. "You're gonna feel like there's nothing inside your head not to go through with it." I began kissing his chest. "I'm not sure I could have done this with you if I'd been married." I kissed around his nipples, licking each one with my tongue.</p> <p>Then I felt his hand on the back of my head, forcing my mouth down against him. I did it a little tighter, as though I was in a hurry to put some force behind my lips. Slowly he moved himself inside me, pressing himself against the headboard as I licked and kissed and nuzzled my way down his body. "How is it making yourself feel like this?" he whispered breathlessly in my ear.</p> <p>"It's so intense. Your dick is so big and so hard in me, you're pushing into me so deep inside me," I moaned against his flesh. "Fuck me hard," he whispered.</p> <p>I wanted to tell him to fuck me really hard, but I couldn't think of the words. My body betrayed me. My hips moved against him, my back arched. He moved against me, taking the time to make sure that he always did the right thing. I couldn't hold back any more. "Take me," I screamed to him. "Take my pussy," I screamed.</p> <p>"Is it good?" he asked quietly.</p> <p>I felt him start to move, but then I felt his lips on my neck, his breath hot on me. His hand was on my thigh, his fingers running up and under the hem of my dress.</p> <p>I cried out again. "Oh, yes, do that." I began to writhe against him, pushing my hips towards his hand as his mouth worked its way up to my ear. He began to kiss down my neck, and I gasped. Then my body felt the cold air as his lips ran over the curve of my breast, sending delicious little shocks of anticipation coursing through my body.</p> <p>"Tell me how it feels," he whispered against my skin, running his tongue over the bare skin of my breast. "Will that really feel good?" he asked, moving his face lower. The tip of his tongue made quick work of the nipple. His hand dropped to my belly again, running it up and down over my lower abdomen, and he stopped only briefly to kiss and lick the area beneath it.</p> <p>"Yes," I repeated, my voice hoarse and breath coming in ragged gasps. "Now."</p> <p>"Do you want me to stop?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I cried.</p> <p>His fingers continued to trace over my belly and down to cup my sex. I felt my legs start to tremble. I thought I'd gone crazy. I reached down to grab his hand in a vain attempt to control him, to hold him close.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he murmured into my ear. "I can't wait to feel you in one of these days," he murmured suggestively. He bent his knees slightly, and I felt his hardness pressing insistently against me.</p> <p>"Are you hungry?" I asked.</p> <p>"As much as I'd like to feel you inside me right now!" he replied. I felt his arm slip around my waist again, and I realized that he'd undone my corset. "Oh, God!" I cried, and I thrust against his hand as he pulled me to him. I could feel the heat of his body pressed against mine, his erection pressing against my thigh. "Take me," I said, desperate to have him inside of me. "Fuck me."
