For a second all she said was ‘I’m coming.’ Her arms were still locked behind me, but that was only to move her head a bit to get a better view of her friend.</p> <p>As the contract was passed off to me, a new experience for both of us, I couldn’t take it anymore,” I responded. “How much do I owe you? How much do I owe you?”</p> <p>“No, that’s not your problem. It’s mine to make. If you need to use that money, I’ll take care of everything. Now please excuse us so we can be alone in the bathroom,” she responded with a smirk. “But thank you anyway.”</p> <p>“I will,” I said, and turned back to the counter to begin the process of paying. ‘After that, I suggest you put one of your panties back on, and I’m sure your going to need a few moments to get a hold of yourself as well. I’ll be back shortly”</p> <p>With that, I began to work my way out of the office. It was quite a walk, but I just knew that by the time I made it back into the elevator I would have an erection. On the way to the fifth floor, I looked back over to the bathrooms where my wife was preparing to use.</p> <p>“Here she comes in.” There she was. Her blouse was loose and the buttons undone, and she had her hands all over herself. As my wife walked past, the shirt became undone and she pushed it up over her breasts in one smooth motion. While waiting for her to close the door, I removed my shirt and stepped back into the bathroom to retrieve my underwear while I continued to walk by the ladies room.</p> <p>As my underwear was pulled off, I turned to see my wife standing in the doorway, and she looked a little upset.</p> <p>“You can join me in there as soon as you get back.”</p> <p>Looking over at my wife, I was momentarily struck by the realization that all this must have been done out of the goodness of all her "God I’m such a dirty bitch" looks. As I walked past the toilet and the sink, she turned to look at me and winked. I walked in to the stall. This had to be all of my "excited" time, and I couldn’t wait to see what would happen next. I turned around and began to unzip. Once I was free, I pulled my briefs down to my ankles and stepped out of them.</p> <p>With a sly smile on her face, my wife reached her hand out to grasp her panties. I looked at her quizzically.</p> <p>“Turn and bend over,” she said. With my back to the other girls, I had the perfect opportunity to undo the button and fly of my jeans just enough to reach into the pants and pull them apart.</p> <p>With the girls watching, they could see me pulling my underwear out, and the thought of the chance to watch me being a dirty little boy made my heart flutter even quicker.</p> <p>My wife and I stood in line, waiting for the door to open. As the door opened, three girls from the women’s conference reached out to me a moment before they saw what I could see. My wife and I turned around and looked both of them in the eye. We both seemed to give each other a little nod, as if to say "thanks".</p> <p>Looking back at my wife, she turned to walk in, and I reached up between my legs a little to feel for myself.</p> <p>“We can’t let anything happen to that nice cock,” she hissed. It was the first time I had heard her say "cock" like that, and it sounded like some sort of sexual statement. It made me feel good that I was the one getting some of the attention. I looked at her, and she had a look of pure excitement on her face and I could tell from her breathing that I was pretty well on the way to it.</p> <p>My wife walked into the stall, while I looked over my shoulder at my wife. We looked each other in the eye and my wife’s hand reached out and I took the opportunity to slip my hand under the hem of her blouse. She quickly turned around, and I slowly slid her blouse back and forth over her shoulders.</p> <p>I slipped my hand further under her arm, and I felt along her ribcage as her hand reached up and squeezed my right breast through my bra.
