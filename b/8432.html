It was nothing I could take away, and I took off my jacket, slipping it on over my leather jacket and straightening my hair.</p> <p>"How was work?" I greeted Sarah a little later in the lobby.</p> <p>"I don't think you're having a good day," she said jovially. It came before my eyes; I felt it, and I wondered if there wouldn't be other ways to look at it. She went first over to my desk, her legs crossed with one hand on her slender thigh and the other on the desk. "Excuse me, I want to sit with you for a minute."</p> <p>I followed her into my office, and she leaned over to me and kissed me, our arms going around each other's waists and our bodies pressed together. When she broke the kiss, my mouth was full of the taste of her breath and she pressed her lips against mine for several seconds before pulling back and kissing me again.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful, like you always do. How long have you worked at this?" I asked her while we kissed, not knowing if she knew that I knew this, or whether she cared about it. I wondered if she knew.</p> <p>She just looked at me, looking very much like a young woman. "I can't believe how you're always doing this," Sarah said before kissing me again. "I'm sorry for what I did."</p> <p>"No, it's okay; it's not really a big thing." I agreed.</p> <p>She pulled away from me and sat down in the executive chair that had been built for me behind the big desk, taking her place at the desk in front of me, her legs crossed, her arms on her ankles and looking over the top of her head. She had a wide expanse of smooth, flat, tanned leg that could be spread up to her shoulders, and she sat there, with her legs crossed, and looked over at me. I couldn't tell whether she was trying to be coy or tease, though I felt a surge of energy in the back of my pussy.</p> <p>"You think you should go home?" she asked, her eyes looking down at me. "You want to stay here?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, smiling at her, trying to maintain an aloofness of some sort. I just wanted her to leave right now, she seemed so confident, which I found a little disturbing.</p> <p>"I'm not going back. I'm telling you to come visit me," she said, putting her hands on my knees. She pushed them up and opened them, just showing me what her thighs were going to expose. I felt my face flushing and looked at her, feeling myself get aroused as she did this, and knew the only thing that would stop me would be being a little uncomfortable.</p> <p>"No," I managed to say quickly, just a little more assertively.</p> <p>"Don't do it," she said, and I heard her take off the clip of her jacket that was covering me but was sitting on her lap in just a t-shirt. She didn't take it off, simply removed it, and put it on top of her t-shirt. She smiled at me when she saw me looking at her, and she put one hand over my eyes with her fingers against hers. I felt flush and hot between my legs, because she could tell, and I felt that stirring inside of me just from looking at her.</p> <p>Without saying anything, we moved next to each other on the bench that was behind the desk, and I looked up at him, who was watching us as I looked down at my legs, and smiled.</p> <p>"I don't know about the legs, but it feels wonderful to be with you," he said, taking my chin in his hands. "Do you have a boyfriend?" he asked, his eyes fixed on mine.</p> <p>"No, no. Actually, I don't. I didn't want to be caught in the same mess by as I did if I wasn't careful," I said, turning my head and looking up in the eyes of my friend, my mind still trying to think of things to say. He put one knee on the bench and rubbed my chin as we looked at each other.</p> <p>"I know, but..." I tried to explain. "I'm just glad that you found this guy, because if I'd come home right now I never would have gone through with this," I said, shaking my head and looking up at him again.
