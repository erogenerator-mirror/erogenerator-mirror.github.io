Oh please stop, you're just too much!" she screamed. "I don't know what my father did to me when he got his head blown off! Please! No more. Just...just please!!" she begged.</p> <p>My hands were at the top of the dildo, and I held her ass firmly for a moment as she struggled with her lust.</p> <p>"It's okay, sweetheart, I won't cum. Just let me cum!" I said.</p> <p>With that, my tongue came out, and slowly slid upwards along her slit as I began to run my long tongue along her slit. She gasped again, just from the initial pain of the initial contact. I had never done this, but knew how sensitive her outer lips were, and was very glad to do so.</p> <p>I felt around the inside of her pussy with my tongue, feeling the muscles along my saliva coated lips as I made my way upwards, as I felt myself get ever closer to her clit, which, although already engorged, was barely enough to be hard, and actually seemed to be poking upward with each breath. My hands slid along her inner thigh now, and my fingers ran through the hair at her pussy, and felt her shiver as she did so.</p> <p>"Oh God!" she whined. "I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>"No," I said softly, "don't stop! I'm gonna finish!"</p> <p>My tongue slid forward along her opening, and felt the wetness there, and pressed inward as it entered her flesh. My tongue entered her slit easily as she let go, and soon I could feel it's warmth and wetness as her sex juices ran down into the groove at the top. Her hips tried to pull away from me, but I held them fast.</p> <p>"No," she whimpered, still trying to draw against me, "don't do that." She continued to struggle, but I held her firm, now.</p> <p>"Oh, please, don't do that," she groaned. "You can't do so...please, stop."</p> <p>"Just relax," I said, "just breathe deeply and don't move."</p> <p>Her hips pushed toward me, and I let go of her ass.</p> <p>She began to move a little forward and back, her weight on her knees, and her hands moving back along her back to rest on my shoulders now—just like when she had grabbed my cock this morning. They moved in a little, in counterpoint to her pussy, and made themselves more prominent, and moved up to her face just the same.</p> <p>I let go of one of her hands now, and slid it along my belly, slowly down toward my cock. I felt her move slightly forward, and her hand slipped over my own, and ran lightly up along to my stomach.</p> <p>I brought my mouth down to hers and began to kiss her mouth once more as my hand moved back down along her body. I could feel the muscles in her body as it tried to force her legs apart. My lips met hers again, and she felt the hair on my chin, the softness of my lips as they parted and my tongue slowly lapped around. My lips returned and slipped back over hers once again, and her lips parted and her tongue touched mine.</p> <p>"Oh, please," she whispered. "Put your cock in me, just do it! Please!"</p> <p>I felt for her inner pussy lips, which they were still engorged, and let her feel the pressure, and then felt my tongue slide out of her mouth and begin to run along her clit. I ran my tongue up her slit, now. "Oh, God," she moaned.</p> <p>I pressed my mouth forward against her, and drove my tongue forward as far as I could. Her lips parted and she let out a gasp, and I could feel the soft inner lips touching me more than I cared to notice. The way she had been shaking in orgasm was making me excited, too.</p> <p>I could feel her body beginning to quiver, and she was shaking a little. I slid my tongue into her, feeling her soft insides—my tongue sliding along her lips as I began to tongue her once more.</p> <p>I felt her moving her hands back along my body now, and again, and knew that she was trying to feel my cock moving inside her. My mouth slid back down along her lips—so now I could feel her thighs squeezing me, and her own breath coming in gasps.</p> <p>Now, I felt a soft pressure against my cock, and I pulled back a little. I felt her hips arch up and slide her hand back down along me. My tongue slid up, and I licked along her slit, feeling her body against my own as she did so.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she moaned again—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
