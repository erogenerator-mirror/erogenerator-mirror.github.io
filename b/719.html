I jumped up and ran to pick up the cordless phone.</p> <p>"Hello."</p> <p>"Hey, is this a good thing or what?"</p> <p>"Just good, it was the best thing you ever did."</p> <p>She sounded a bit upset and said something that made me feel bad for not being able to talk more.</p> <p>"No, don't worry. I'll answer anything you want to know."</p> <p>"Okay, what's up?"</p> <p>"So, why did you decide to work with me instead of you just moving out?"</p> <p>"You have a point about it, but I'll have to go over and say hello."</p> <p>"I thought you were done with that conversation?"</p> <p>"Why am I so tired?"</p> <p>"I guess so."</p> <p>We talked a bit more.</p> <p>"I wanted to apologize for what I said earlier, but I can't."</p> <p>"For what?"</p> <p>"No, I should have apologized, but now there might be a good reason for it."</p> <p>"Go ahead. It's all my fault."</p> <p>"I'm not. I just wasn't used to hearing myself so clearly."</p> <p>"Okay, that is understandable since I never considered being single that way before."</p> <p>"Why did you ask?"</p> <p>"Because you are so nice."</p> <p>"I'm just sorry it took me so long to realize you could see me."</p> <p>"I'm sorry that you waited, but you need to tell me exactly where you felt you shouldn't look."</p> <p>"So far, it's been only five miles."</p> <p>"That's probably nothing, but it happened so fast that it's a very big improvement."</p> <p>"I think we should leave the way we are now, so that's settled."</p> <p>"You're right. I don't know about the drive back to your house tomorrow,"</p> <p>"I can take you up on that. Thanks for being here for me today."</p> <p>"Is that why I had to ask you? Was I that bad?"</p> <p>"No, you are not bad. In fact, you're an excellent leader. I think you deserve a second vote now."</p> <p>"You're right. I should have just gone to the mall, but I'm not a mall girl. I just work in a department store and it's all the girls who dress up. It's not like that."</p> <p>"Good, but don't try to talk to me that way."</p> <p>"We'll see. I just wanted to say thanks again for what you did to me, okay?"</p> <p>"You're such a sweetie,"</p> <p>"How are things going with your mother?"</p> <p>"Well, nothing, I just keep in shape. She told me about the new car and my parents are doing alright. I guess they are still in contact. We had the talk this afternoon, as I promised you."</p> <p>"Okay, I know you want to say goodbye." She laughed and gave me a peck on the cheek.</p> <p>After that I got back to my place. When I picked her up I wasn't able to decide on whether to let her go with me or to drive her home. I didn't want to say goodbye to her, but I did really want to see those perfect breasts again. We had a nice talk and she was definitely smiling. I made as small a deal of going home as I could. I was going to make one of those small kisses I always do. By the time I got home all the lights were on in our smallish home and there were no sound of my car in our drive way. When I put the garage door closed I turned around to see her standing over me. She grabbed her shirt off and looked at me. When I opened my mouth and made a big show of sucking on her breasts she said, "Just a little warning, you don't get much time to do that, do you?"</p> <p>"I've tried my best."</p> <p>"So... how about we go a little easy?"</p> <p>"There's really a bit more to going at dinner now that we're here."</p> <p>The conversation went on for about an hour.</p> <p>There was some kind of dinner or dessert after dinner that she really had to eat. By the time we finished and went to bed she was looking for a good time. It just was. We made love and slept like babies. We talked about how we could try to keep our relationship even.</p> <p>It ended with us bothâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
