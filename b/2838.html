He could still feel her warmth as the water cascaded down over his body. He felt so much more than a complete sexual being. He had been so excited for years by watching women on stage, but now he had to do things to take all of that away, that excitement.</p> <p>He couldn't wait anymore. He had to get off.</p> <p>It was going to be a long two weeks.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Sidling up from his couch to the mirror, he opened the door to see her in the steamy kitchen. She was putting away the groceries as she made a cup of tea.</p> <p>"So?" He asked as he moved to stand next to her. Her eyes were glued to his body as she pulled out her hands and opened them slowly so they were tight on each other.</p> <p>"I had a meeting with a client," she said, taking a deep slow sip of her drink. He could feel his cock stir again at the sight of her. Her body was perfect. He had to touch it. He reached down and took a hold of her shoulders and pulled her towards him. She smiled as she put her arms around him. "This is your day," she said.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you like it," He said with a smile. She leaned in to kiss him quickly followed by a deep breath as she pushed her lips away from his lips.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked. Her hands began to work down his chest. He could feel the heat of her palms through his shirt as her fingertips ran gently over his nipples.</p> <p>"I'm sure." She sat back on the counter and took another drink, "So, about the story?" she asked. She placed her fingers to her lips to moisten the rim before she looked him in the eye.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "The guy...he was a really, really weird guy. He took me out of my mind." She began to unbutton his shirt. "The first time we went out there, he just sat there looking at me, and..." She ran her fingers over his collarbones and down to his chest. "He touched me all over."</p> <p>"Really?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes, really." She smiled seductively. "He was just waiting for his date to end so he could...fuck me." She ran her hands down her torso then lifted them up to her chest. "I told him we were going out, that I wanted this...thing..."</p> <p>"You did?" Mark asked. She just gave him the smile. She knew he was curious, but he was too nervous to ask.</p> <p>"Yeah. I thought he would at least get a chance to get up to speed on me." She took a sip of her drink and looked him in the eye. "But, he didn't." she said. She knew how it feels to be a total stranger at the onset of your first love. She had tried to find a way to break it off, but she could not. She simply couldn't, and he had to wait.</p> <p>"So, what did you do then?" He laughed at her. He loved how she was so sexy and it showed. He began getting nervous all over again.</p> <p>"It was kind of funny," she said, "it's weird watching you do it." She took another sip from her drink. "This isn't like my last one. This is a different kind of fucking." She smiled as her fingers slid down her tummy to her pussy and pressed slightly against it. She leaned down onto her palms and slowly dragged her fingers through her hair and down toward her vagina. "He got really excited watching," she continued, "And...he wanted me to stop. I told him I didn't want to, but I had to. So, he took his shirt off and sat back down next to me." Her fingers came up to cover her mouth as she pulled her panties back so she could feel their wetness and run her fingers over her mound.</p> <p>"No, no. You don't have to," he said.</p> <p>"No, I do," she said. She slowly slid down the counter and sat against his erection. She slid the panties down so they were almost the same height as his cock. She leaned in and kissed the tip. "I'm a little scared."</p> <p>"Me too," he said, "But I like the fact that you're still a virgin. No one is going to take your cherry. The doctor will take my card that reads 'I'm so young that I should be on a first name basis' with 'I've been a virgin all my life.'" He was looking at her.
