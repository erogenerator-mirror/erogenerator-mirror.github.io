He paused the song. "We can go to a movie, if you're not uncomfortable. I was going to give you a break."</p> <p>"But I'm wearing my bikini, Sir."</p> <p>"Yes, I know about you taking my money. And no, I won't do anything with your money. I'll give you your clothes back, if you let me."</p> <p>"Yes, Sir."</p> <p>"Then let's go to the movies where I'll show you how comfortable you'll be."</p> <p>"OK, Sir." They left the movie theater. When they got in the car, the driver took his hand and held it over her mouth.</p> <p>"No. Let me look, please."</p> <p>"OK, Sir," she whispered, not believing what she did.</p> <p>"Take it out, let me see. And I promise, if you take everything off, it'll feel better."</p> <p>"Sir?"</p> <p>"Yes, baby?"</p> <p>"I...I could feel you through your...my...piece of cloth. I...I can feel you, Sir."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, baby. Not a word. Just take it out, that's all you're going to get."</p> <p>She watched him remove his hand from her mouth. "Please...don't," she whispered.</p> <p>"You will. But I can't see it from there." He held the head of his cock in his hand. "It's bigger than my whole penis. So if you...ummm. . .just take it in a little. And when it slips out, it's going to....that's it. It's going to....."</p> <p>It began to swell. He held it steady till it began to throb. She felt its warmth in her hands and lips. It began to swell to almost a full erection. He pulled it up and put it in her mouth. She sucked it lightly. "Hmmm. It's pretty thick, isn't it?" She felt his hand on the back of her head holding her mouth hard over his cock. "Just wait a moment. I have something more to show you." He took it out. He pushed her onto her stomach. She didn't resist. He slipped his hand under her skirt. He slid between her legs before she knew what happened. "Hmmm. I...ummm. Not so...dirty. Now it's my turn."</p> <p>He pushed her legs apart. He pushed her panties up. He saw her little asshole. He wanted only to tease her. He looked down at her cunt. There was only thin hair covering it. "Hmmm." He licked it for a moment. She shivered and put her legs back up. "No." He laughed. "Not so close."</p> <p>He pushed her legs so that her ass was on her stomach. His cock still in her mouth.</p> <p>"You ready?" He said and shoved it in her. "This feels better." He moved it in and out, pushing and pulling. The wetness of her pussy, almost as tight as her mouth.</p> <p>They got into the movie house first. He pushed her legs back and she put them to her head. She felt his cock as it entered her wetness. He began to move it a little faster. He pulled out a bit and pushed it back in. She let her legs fall back down. Back and forth. Faster and faster.</p> <p>It was like nothing she had ever felt before. Then it happened. He stopped moving it and just held it there. She moved her hips, grinding herself against it. He let his breath go. It was hot and a mix of both. No words were spoken. Just a heavy sigh. He felt his orgasm start deep inside. He shot into her so quickly and so hard. He lay on top of her, gasping.</p> <p>He kissed her, tasting himself on her mouth. Then he raised himself. "Get into your pants and panties, then come back to the movie theater. I'll wait downstairs. You can come out to the parking lot after I've left. I'll let you watch until I come back. And then I'll get inside you, too, when I'm done."</p> <p>"Yes, sir," she whispered, her arms on her knees.</p> <p>"Now, go have fun." He left the theater.</p> <p>When he came back, he stopped at the car. "Honey? Would you mind if I parked someplace else in the lot? I want to get some more of that. I'm not sorry about our fucking. At least not at first. Not even this time. I mean it, baby."</p> <p>He climbed in with her. "I said, could you do that again?"</p> <p>"Yes, Sir.
