We stayed, just enjoying the moment, before our legs gave way. He was out of the house, walking me to the livingroom in the middle of the night. I lay in the middle of the couch, his arms wrapped around my thighs, moving my pussy around against his erection. We moved together, I still riding him, he reaching up to stroke my breasts. He wanted more and pulled us over by my head, our bodies pressing against each other's until we got caught in the couch.</p> <p>As he pulled at my clothes, I moved to get up. My legs were trembling, he didn't let go of my hand, I wanted to hold him and kiss him, but he didn't release my hands. I was naked in the middle of the room, my hands fumbled trying to find him. I wasn't sure I could stop him, what would happen, then we were kissing while he pushed me face down on the couch, he got between my legs and we started on my pussy. I felt myself get very wet, he was rubbing my pussy with one hand, and moving it with the other, teasing my pussy lips with the tip of my clit. I couldn't move for fear of falling to the floor if I started to cum, and I did, a few times, when he moved up the bed to kiss me.</p> <p>I couldn't help but return the kisses as I was, we ended up lying side by side, he started to kiss my neck. I could feel his hard cock on my leg, he moved down to kiss me there too. His hand was wandering everywhere, playing with my tits, moving down my stomach. He started kissing me, a few times, licking up and down my face as he moved down to kiss each nipple in turn. My breathing got heavier, his lips were getting closer and closer until they finally were kissing around my lips, down my chin and into my mouth. Our tongues were dancing together in front of us, his hands were fondling my breasts, moving between them, teasing my nipples gently.</p> <p>His kisses got higher between my thighs. They started to move in unison, one long and intense kiss before his lips could find the lips around them. He moved back up the bed slowly so that I could just feel the heat from his tongue as it went up and down my slit. I was moaning from the feeling of his tongue between my legs, the feeling of his fingers in my pussy. I was moving up and down the bed trying to move in closer to him, hoping that he wouldn't touch the cock I wasn't able to reach with my fingers yet.</p> <p>By the time his tongue finally made its way out from between my lips to start licking the outside of my pussy. I was completely out of my mind with the sensation of his tongue licking me. He started by slowly flicking around my clit, then followed that up with a couple of little kisses against it, all the while keeping his tongue in me, moving up until he made it move across the base of my clit. When he did that, my body started to shake and I started to cum.</p> <p>My pussy clenched on his tongue as I started cumming, he moved his mouth up, kissing me softly, letting me get his lips off my mouth for a moment to catch my breath. I couldn't move any farther apart but could feel movement inside me as he lay beside me. He moved his lips across mine, I felt his tongue move to me, to me that I could not tell but it felt so good. He continued to kiss me until it was over, then his lips moved to my neck sucking softly. This made my whole body tingle and I felt my entire being start to explode.</p> <p>When my body calmed down, he lifted his face from my neck and grinned at me. We lay facing each other, his arms around me, his face in my breast. We cuddled there, not saying a word but both of us lost in our own thoughts. It was time to go, so we got dressed and headed home and headed home together. I got home late, I didn't see him but he must have done the same as I did. We went into the house and made some supper, he did the same as I did. We sat around the room sharing a plate, making idle chitchat, when his phone started to ring and I told him that it was time to get ready to leave. Of course I didn't know that it was the same number as the night before, so he answered it and hung up before I had time to ask if he was in town with us. He did that by slipping his hand under my skirt, he felt the wetness between my legs. He told me again not to hold out on to him, that he had to do it.</p> <p>We got out of bed after gettingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
