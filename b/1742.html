I loved the salty feel of her, the smell of her. I kept my fingers running in her wetness for as long as I could stand the incredible feeling of the first of her orgasms. My cock was rock hard.</p> <p>I wanted us both to cum in one night. I wanted us both to be there in the darkness, naked bodies entwined, kissing, hugging, kissing. My fingers still worked in her, moving in waves in my lap. I knew if I held on long enough, I could pull her onto that beautiful cock again.</p> <p>Her muscles contracted once again, forcing my fingers to move faster in her. She started bucking against my hand, moaning as we both neared mutual orgasm. I didn't know how much more of this it could take, she was so beautiful in my arms. It was pure pleasure that was beyond description. She was mine. I held as close as I could, and I was in heaven...</p> <p>But we both heard the pounding at the front door.</p> <p>We knew it was coming so early, but we didn't care. I just had the most incredible orgasm. I could hardly wait to see what was next.</p> <p>We didn't have much time to clean up though. I got up and headed for the bathroom with her lying on top of me with her legs wrapped around my waist. She was still quivering, but looking forward to getting to that moment forever.</p> <p>She felt so warm, I held her and kissed her, running my hands over her back, her neck. She kissed back and I felt her pussy on the head of my cock. I was fully into her, but I knew it wouldn't take much more.</p> <p>"Let me up..." I whispered.</p> <p>She gently pulled back and rose off me. I laid on my back, and she moved toward me. I held her, holding a breast in each hand, cupping those perfect breasts. I felt her pussy on the head of my cock, and it felt amazing. I had never felt anything so perfectly smooth and natural before. It was incredible.</p> <p>She lifted her mouth and looked me in the eyes, and slowly ran her tongue around my nipple. All the nerve endings were on high alert. Her breasts were so soft, and her nipples so large.</p> <p>I reached out and pulled her to me, pulling her on top of me. Her pussy was wet on my cock, and it felt wonderful as it slid in and out. She began riding my cock faster and faster, and I began to buck my hips back when she thrust one leg down and locked her pussy with mine, pressing my cock hard against my own.</p> <p>The sensation was amazing. I could feel a building of pleasure in both of us, and that added to the excitement. It was just the feeling of one of our bodies in perfect harmony. It was everything we've been building for so long. We both came together, screaming out our passion, and just holding each other. The feeling was perfect.</p> <p>For an older man, the orgasms can be as intense or as simple. For me, this was just an incredible experience. I couldn't ever imagine life without one of these.</p> <p>I wrapped my arms over her and kissed her, tasting myself and her. I never knew such blisss. To have her body and our hearts and souls were in harmony. And we were both feeling amazing and right for the first timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
