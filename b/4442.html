He looked good, for an older man. His grey eyes were intense and he had a twinkle in his eyes. I was still uncertain of him. I had never been attracted to a man, other than my own son, but that wasn't the reason for the meeting in the first place.</p> <p>"I had to buy an old television set," he said while taking the fireplace mantle from the mantle and laying a thick blanket on the floor. "Do you mind, Ms. Wilson? We'll be sleeping right by you, right?"</p> <p>I looked at him. "Sure," I said. I was a bit intimidated. I didn't know this man.</p> <p>"Of course you don't", he said. "Come with me.", he said.</p> <p>He pulled me away from the mantle, and we walked into the small bedroom. He pulled me against him and I leaned against his chest. As we stood there, he brushed his lips over mine. I could feel his stubble on my face, his thick beard scratching my cheek. I felt a shiver run through my body. The kiss had a bit of urgency as it was filled with a strong passion. I leaned my head on his shoulder, and nuzzled it as he gently caressed my face with his thumb. I felt the goose bumps on my thighs as I leaned into his neck, inhaling his smell. My thoughts raced with possibilities of what it might be like to be kissed by him. His hands began to slide downwards, cupping my butt in his hands. I could feel them move under the blanket from time to time. It was thrilling to be naked under his arms, exposed to him. He leaned forward and kissed me all over my face and neck. I groaned into his mouth which sent goose bumps all over my body.</p> <p>He began to slide his hands under my shirt, running his fingers over my bra, feeling me up between my breasts. He caressed my back and he kissed the nape of my neck while his hands pulled my shirt upwards and he continued to stroke me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry baby, it's all so quick," he said. "I'm sorry I've been gone so long for you."</p> <p>"Don't be sorry! It's not all about me. I want you, and I want you!" he said, sounding almost serious.</p> <p>He pulled away from me as he stood up and his hand moved to my shorts. I could feel the heat of him on my thighs, and he peeled down my shorts. My cock stood at attention, hard in his direction. I looked down to see what it was, it was a rock hard cock that matched my own.</p> <p>"Mmmm", I said in between breaths. "It's beautiful, isn't it?"</p> <p>He smiled and gave me a few quick pecks on my lips and down my chin. He began to unbutton my shirt slowly. He slipped it off of my shoulders and arms. It fell below my elbows. He undid the top button of my shorts, and slid them a bit and the zipper down, slowly lowering them a bit further.</p> <p>"That's a lot of weight from your chest," he said, giving me a glance up and down. He slid his hands into my underwear and grasped my cock tightly.</p> <p>"God, you're beautiful," I said. "You feel pretty big there, too."</p> <p>"It's all yours", he said into my ear. "Take off my shirt".</p> <p>I looked down at myself, my cock throbbing in his hand. I was naked under the blanket, exposed to him as he knelt down in front of me, his warm hands on my body. I slid my hands to the bottom of my shirt and up my chest. He slid it over my bare shoulders and chest.</p> <p>"Don't worry", he said, pulling my hands away and letting me touch his beautiful chest. He gave my ass cheeks a gentle squeeze, making them jiggle. "My hands are all yours", he said, moving his hands down my body and pulling my underwear down. He knelt down and let me slide the underwear free, leaving only my boots and socks on. He turned around and I got down on my knees before him, looking up at his face.</p> <p>"Let me," he said. His dick stood straight up, the head inches from my mouth. I opened my mouth and placed my wet tongue over the tip of his cock as it started to ooze pre-cum to my taste buds. I could feel his cock throb with excitement against my tongue.</p> <p>He stepped backwards to a kneeling position, his feet on either side of my body and his shoulders on my back.
