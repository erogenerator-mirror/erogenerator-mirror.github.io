I can pay. That's what you're here for," I said to the other men. "Besides, I'm on vacation. I can show you around, if you want so. It will only take the other half of my fee."</p> <p>The man at the other end of the sofa smiled at me and nodded as the other men sat and looked at each other.</p> <p>I walked over and slid a few bills in his wallet and said,</p> <p>"Thank you for the information, my friend. I hope this is all right,"</p> <p>He nodded and started to get up, but then looked at me and said,</p> <p>"Let's go to my room...we can take off these clothes...but do not get off the sofa...we'll need more to sit on later."</p> <p>I agreed and followed him to his room which he said contained three single beds and an old fashioned twin. The mattress was two-story with one wall in the back, and the top one was carpeted like it was old, although it had been painted the same bright red. I sat down and he helped me unbutton my blouse then unbuckled my skirt and let it fall to my feet. I stood up and he helped me remove the rest of my clothing before letting them fall to the floor. I had on black panties and a black demi-bra with matching hose. I stepped closer to him and pushed him back slightly so he wouldn't be sitting on the side of the bed. I walked back over to his bureau and pulled out the cuffs they keep and clipped them onto his feet as well as the collar around his neck. I pulled apart his shirt and pulled the collar off then pulled him by his leash up over the headboard. I could hear a loud, rhythmic beating as he stood there and kept his eyes lowered and he couldn't look back. I attached the chains to his nipples with the clamps and then pulled a second chain down from the collar to tie it off. They looked to be about two feet long and I wondered if they would be too much but I was more worried about getting my hands dirty. I pulled him down to one of the beds so I could tie him up there but he wouldn't move or get up. I sat him down and attached the belt to the collar before tying a different chain to his ankles. I then had him start to tie my blouse up. He got it so I could do it by hand and I could see right through it because it was dark outside. I looked across at the other bed and smiled as I felt his eyes on my legs but before I reached the top of the bed, my feet touched the edge and I felt the cool air as my bare foot touched the mattress. I was starting to get warm and my nipples swelled and hardened as I watched them rise and fall as I was restrained. I looked back at him and then put on my skirt then crawled back to the other room so I could tie up the other three men. As I moved back to the door, I felt a strong hand on my shoulder, it was Jamal. Once he had me, I pushed him away again, this time he didn't seem afraid at all and he walked back over to the bed and sat down on it. I looked at him questioningly and he didn't say anything. I looked back at the bed and he pulled and tugged at my leash. He had to stand still so I tied up my blouse just above my nipples. I took my nipple rings off and put them onto one ring next to the chain and then took my skirt off. I watched him unzip his pants and pull them down while sitting on the bed, he pulled his pants down to his knees and stepped out of them. Now, I'm not sure just how he got them off since his cock was still sticking out. The other three men were all naked and my blouse was hanging off my skirt and was not as sheer as my skirt but definitely no panties on.</p> <p>Mandy had already finished getting dressed and when he stood up, he saw the four pairs of black panties I owned in my hand. He looked at them confused and stopped as I said,</p> <p>"I just came here to get dressed, so you can leave before I finish. And the rest of the men can wait here,"</p> <p>He nodded and reached up to kiss me then said,</p> <p>"You take care. I can't wait to see you in class tomorrow...and you are mine,"</p> <p>And with two more words, he walked out of the room leaving Jamal and I in the room.</p> <p>"He is just going to have to wait here until tomorrow morning," I thought to myself as I walked down the hallway back to my room where I unbuttoned my blouse and let it fall open.
