I thought to myself in one of the most sexual thoughts I ever had...and I couldn't take it back. I dressed in a sheer blouse and skirt and headed downstairs. I sat for a minute in the family room with a glass of wine then came towards the lounge with my glass. I sat down next to Andy, and he immediately turned toward me so we could talk.</p> <p>"So, how was the trip?" he asked, breaking the tension.</p> <p>"It was awesome, I love the resort and look forward to the next day," I said, pouring a glass. "I was thinking that if the weather was good, we could go out for dinner tomorrow night."</p> <p>"Sounds good, I have a surprise for you," Andy said, grabbing my hand and leading me to the guest room. We both looked at the picture of our mothers together on the bed.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, that sounds so wonderful."</p> <p>After we finished eating and a glass of wine, we climbed into bed and took a short nap. When we woke, we showered again and climbed in the shower together. I was still horny from last night and we both started kissing again, but we stopped each time we came to each other. We finished our shower and got out of the shower. We dried ourselves off and then started walking to our bedroom. We went straight to the living room to watch a soft porn movie. Andy was standing at the head of the sofa as the movie started. He turned around and I took his cock in my hand. He put his hand on my right leg and moved me in the same direction, before he got the idea to bend me over it's back and enter me.</p> <p>He reached his arm around me, pulling my hair and I reached around and put my arms around his neck. Andy lowered his mouth to my breasts and began licking them. He moved to my neck, his tongue running along my smooth skin as he licked. His hand moved to feel the hardness of my clit and to move me towards him with the full feeling of his mouth. I placed my hand on his thigh and we got down on the floor again, both still fully dressed. Now I was lying topless in only blouse and skirt and he again had an erection bulging out of his pants. I put my hands in his hair and he lifted me slightly. We continued kissing and feeling each other body as we stood there. He moved one of his hands from my breasts to my pussy, feeling the warmth and slickness. He pressed on my labia, inserting two fingers and moving them in me as he stroked me, up and down a few times, then he stopped and went to his room.</p> <p>He entered the room and came back with some toys. They were different than we expected, different sizes, different shapes, different colors, and he used them on me until I was ready to come. He stood next to the sofa and I sat on it, facing the sofa. He moved to my right side and began to move his hand to my cunt but I let him continue. We continued to make out on the sofa as he touched me from the rear. He was feeling my ass and could feel the wetness, which brought me closer. I placed my other hand on his balls, squeezing and rolling them. The feeling was exquisite and I came just before he did.</p> <p>"Wow," I heard him say. I felt his fingers on the back of my neck but he went right back to my vagina. He took his erect penis and moved it from side to side, teasing it until I was ready to beg him to put it in. He moved me so that I was facing back towards him and he rubbed the head into the entrance of my cunt and I moved just so. When he was in as far as he could go, he moved down my body, kissing and licking my thighs and my butt. In his quest to lick my clitoris, he moved away from my body and touched his erect penis to my anus, pushing it gently in and out. It was too much. I came again and again, and then he stood and put his penis in my pussy. "Oh my God," I said, as he moved his body backwards and forwards. With the other hand he grabbed his penis and rubbed my clitoris as he entered me slowly. I reached one hand around his back and held around his balls while I moved my ass and vagina around. "Yeah," he said and started to kiss me. I sucked his tongue with mine. He kept kissing me. "I need your tongue now," I said. "I want your cock deep inside of me." He moved his penis all the way in me. For a minute, we were still but we slowly came down from our sexual high. Both of us were exhausted but we both knew that tomorrow nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
