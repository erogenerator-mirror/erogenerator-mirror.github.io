That's what the girls do when they are riding me."</p> <p>He grinned mischievously. "Well if it pleases you, I'd love to do that, now put me on top!"</p> <p>She pushed the t-shirt back up over her breasts and his mouth dropped to her nipples again.</p> <p>Oh yes, my breasts feel good, but they hurt so much. I'm not sure they are as big as the ones you have.</p> <p>His hands went back to her bottom, and she felt his fingers go there again.</p> <p>I told her once she wasn't a virgin, I can't wait until we are together.</p> <p>She reached back to untie his jeans, and he assisted her. She let the t-shirt drop onto the grass so that he could step out of them. He stepped out of them, and she looked around to make sure no one would be looking at them. There were a ton of people around, many of them enjoying the show.</p> <p>She was naked but for her panties. She knew he wasn't getting dressed quickly.</p> <p>His big grin made her think he was eager, and she pushed the top of his boxers to his knees so that her fingers were rubbing the outline of his erection through the fabric.</p> <p>He pulled his boxers off so she could kick them off, and she saw his big manhood.</p> <p>Oh my, it's gorgeous.</p> <p>She rubbed at his shaft with her hands, his hard cock just inches from her face.</p> <p>She opened her mouth and took the tip between her lips.</p> <p>Her lips surrounded it and moved up and down slowly.</p> <p>It felt very exciting to be in that familiar warmth with this beautiful cock filling her mouth so completely.</p> <p>"Oh yes do that" he moaned loudly, the tip of it touching her tongue. She moved her mouth more and more, more as he gasped above her.</p> <p>"Do what baby?" she asked.</p> <p>She loved using that expression when she was doing things in her mind that she didn't know a man would love.</p> <p>"What you're thinking right now" he laughed.</p> <p>His voice was hoarse and deep, so much so that she had to fight trying not to cry to take in what she was doing to him. She continued, her hands moving more easily then he had.</p> <p>He moved so that she had better balance on her knees, his cock still in her mouth but more in a warm embrace. His fingers ran from her hair to her shoulders to her breasts again.</p> <p>He held her as she slid up his cock, her mouth sliding along the length until he felt the knob of it as she slid back down.</p> <p>"Baby, are you OK, I mean... I don't know how we are going to keep from cumming this way?" he asked.</p> <p>She couldn't answer him because she couldn't believe he wanted her to blow him and suck his thing so quickly.</p> <p>His voice shook her.</p> <p>She put a finger to his lips, stopping him.</p> <p>He tried to say something, to tell her to go on, but couldn't quite.</p> <p>"Just hold on, I'm so close"</p> <p>And he did just that, his balls tightened, and he moaned her name more loudly.</p> <p>She let his balls go, and felt him surge in her mouth.</p> <p>It was one of the biggest orgasms she had ever had.</p> <p>When it was over she pulled it slowly out of her mouth, her tongue licking at the tip until it oozed out, the wet white goo glistening in the sun.</p> <p>She looked up at his face and smiled.</p> <p>"Well then, how about some lunch, " she said, as she slid her shirt back up, "You do that properly."</p> <p>He laughed and kissed her, this time it was longer, deeper, the intensity of their lust.</p> <p>They kissed tenderly for a moment, his tongue in her mouth, his hands exploring her body again.</p> <p>"Let's head back first, I need to see more of your room."</p> <p>He followed her, and helped her to her feet.</p> <p>She turned her back to him, bent over the desk and leaned over the desk, her breasts hanging down slightly.</p> <p>He stood behind her, his hands at the small of her back, his cock slowly touching her slit and pushing into her ass. Her head fell back.</p> <p>He moved his cock in and out of her, the head sliding in and out with each stroke.</p> <p>He slid his hands down her body, finding her breasts again and cupping them both. He pinched her nipples between his fingers.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum for you" he toldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
