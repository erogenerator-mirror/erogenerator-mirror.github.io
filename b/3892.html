It’s always nice to have an excuse to come when there’s a conference about to start. I can’t imagine what you’ll be thinking when I give you a ride.”</p> <p>“Well, you’ve done that once already tonight, I don’t think a good start.” He said with a grin.</p> <p>Babs burst into giggles. “It’s funny you think that.” She said softly. “I guess I’ll catch up with you after these meetings.” She said with a giggle.</p> <p>“Well, I’ll see you in a quarter hour.” He said as he kissed her cheek softly.</p> <p>Amber walked towards the elevators to her bedroom leaving her on her own with a little surprise. She looked out the door, watching her walk away, trying to work up the courage to call him. The excitement of his kiss made her feel as if she would give him a heart attack if she had a second, at least when it came time for him to come out from his coma.</p> <p>The anticipation had built between them since it had started. She was going to see him again tonight. She was sure he would say yes, he was just surprised he wouldn’t already be there in time to meet her. She would wait for him. She was going to wait to see what he would say when he was ready to be ready.</p> <p>Amber knew she could feel him getting aroused. She didn’t want to wait, it was her turn tonight. They both knew what would happen next and neither had a clue that the other was aware of what was to come next. She didn’t even care if he had a clue that they weren’t going to do it in the open. It wouldn’t be so bad. Amber wasn’t worried; she wanted to hold back and savor the moment, savoring the moment of that first meeting. They had come too far at that moment, so she waited.</p> <p>The elevator came to a stop at the bottom floor of the building. She made her way across the lobby, and stopped in her bedroom, still trying to see if she wanted him in there.</p> <p>“Come on, you know you want to.” She said out loud as she sat down on the bed.</p> <p>“Are you sure you don’t want to do this, Amber?” He asked with concern.</p> <p>Amber smiled. “Why do you think it might be a good move for me to say nothing about it when, after the conference, he’ll come back to you, and it’s only a matter of time. But I’m glad we were here as a couple, and I need to let him know that I am okay with what we have been going to do.”</p> <p>“I’m sorry I could never be sure if you were sure.” He said as he came up to her. He had a big, big grin on his face. “I’m just a little worried for my own sake.”</p> <p>“Are you?” Amber asked, smiling up at him.</p> <p>“Yeah, I am.” He said, giving a little shrug. “I think it’s important that there be nothing going on that will give us even a chance to get past this first meeting.”</p> <p>“Well, I don’t see why not. We should probably at least get to go to bed before it becomes all weird.” She said, giving an exaggerated sigh.</p> <p>They lay there in each other’s arms for some time, until it was time for him to get up. “I need to get going.” Amber said. “There’s still much we need to talk about before—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
