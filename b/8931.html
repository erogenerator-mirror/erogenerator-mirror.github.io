Are you all shaved?" she said, surprised.</p> <p>"Uh uh. I'm not that flexible."</p> <p>My God, my mom must know what my problem is. I've got all day. "I'm not shaved." I told them. I'm not, I'm not.</p> <p>She gave me a big smile and gave me a pat on the back.</p> <p>"You know, Mom."</p> <p>"Really? Did my baby girl talk you into shaving your legs or something?"</p> <p>"No!" She yelled. "I didn't, you know."</p> <p>I turned from her. She had started on my dick.</p> <p>"Oh Mom, I'm so sorry." I said. "Did you not shave my legs?"</p> <p>"No. I shaved my pussy." She admitted.</p> <p>"You shaved your pussy. What's wrong with you?" I said with a frown but she looked up at me. I was getting embarrassed. I had never really talked about anything sexual. I never had a girlfriend before and never even kissed a girl. But what I am doing with her right now is wrong. I'm 18, I'm a mature adult, I'm a grown man and don't know a thing about this sexual thing. It's wrong!</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry." She replied. "My God, I think he's shaving my pussy. I'm so nervous!"</p> <p>"Mom you can't stop him." I told her. "He doesn't want you to shave his bush."</p> <p>"No, I can stop him. I like him. But I don't think that would be very sexy." She responded. "I don't want you to stop him."</p> <p>"Do you? I like him. I liked making love with him." I felt bad for being so naïve in front of her. "I guess I'm not as sexy as my brothers. I don't feel this way about my body."</p> <p>She looked at me. "Do you know that his penis is like a boy's cock?" She asked.</p> <p>I had no idea. I hadn't even touched myself. "Well, Mom. If you think, uh, I've looked at your breasts."</p> <p>"And I can tell?" She queried. "I just didn't look at yours."</p> <p>"You wouldn't know." I told her. I felt like an idiot. "I can tell they aren't as pretty when they are hard!"</p> <p>She seemed to relax a bit. "I'm sorry. But look at my legs. It looks like they're the same as my pussy and that's all you can see of my bald pussy."</p> <p>I was just trying to be sincere.</p> <p>Mom seemed to get upset. "Honey, I told you that all the men are like that. It's just a natural thing. You've seen what a lot of them are doing, so you know why?" She said.</p> <p>I couldn't talk anymore. I just lay there, my dick in my mom's face</p> <p>"You said all men aren't my type."</p> <p>"That's what I meant, Mom." I said.</p> <p>"Well, that doesn't matter all that much. If a man wants to touch your pussy, there's nothing wrong with that, so just take him for a while, okay?" Mom asked. She reached out and stroked my dick.</p> <p>I felt ashamed. This was wrong. I felt so dirty! "I didn't mean it that way." I told her. "It's just that sometimes it feels wrong." I felt sick with myself. "But sometimes I like what I see." I told her. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>She hugged me, "It's alright. Trust me there's nothing wrong with what you see."</p> <p>"You just can't help yourself." I whispered. "It's wrong. You're supposed to be making love with a man!"</p> <p>"Honey it's always wrong." She said. "But we know this isn't wrong. We know each other all our lives. There's nothing wrong.
