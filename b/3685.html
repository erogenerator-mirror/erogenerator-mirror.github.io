My feet still felt like they weighed a ton and I could feel the muscles as the water dripped down my legs. I walked over to my small walker and leaned against the door so when I leaned to the right, my feet went right into the shower, my left foot left a crack. I felt my stomach go really tight when I felt the weight of the water, I felt my body jump as I felt all the water flow over me. I felt my whole body burn as it splashed against my skin, and a feeling of pleasure grew in my heart. My head was spinning, and my mouth was open. I closed my eyes and relaxed, my mind in complete control of myself.</p> <p>My phone began to buzz in my hand and I immediately put them down, grabbing the receiver with my right arm. I turned it to my ear and a buzz began, it was like the buzz of a thousand bees buzzing in my head. I kept my eyes closed in a mask of anticipation.</p> <p>"Hello?" Came from my other side. "Hello?" As the phone vibrated, I could feel it vibrating into the back of my left ear. "Yes," I thought to myself as it buzzed from my other side. "Are you?" Then the buzz began and I heard something else. "Honey how is the beach the last day?" I opened my eyes and looked down, surprised to find my breasts hanging in the shower. "Oh dear, I guess your busy," said my voice with a little tremor to it.</p> <p>I turned the shower off and quickly stepped out of the bathtub. After getting the temperature going, I grabbed my towel and wrapped it around my hair. After I took a few steps, I walked back to my room, I put on the white bikini and a white tank top. I put on a pair of white panties with no bra, as the front part of my thong was wet from the hot water. I put a white tank top on and the thin white straps went over my breasts that pushed them up. The top was very tight and showed my nipples right up to the tips as if I wore the thin strap there at all. As I finished pulling the tank on, I took the tiny white panties off and put them to my hair. I pulled on a black knee-high heeled bootie and zipped my back to the top of my thighs. The bikini bottom was not that far up my hips and when I stood, it had a little bend in the back. If the water had gone any lower than the top, it would be a lot more see through and the look of the dark triangle of pubic hair that surrounded the tiny little pink nubs would show up just a bit on occasion. As I was picking out my sandals and putting on my little shorts, I walked around my room. It was dark and very comfortable, as I got closer to the door.</p> <p>I had turned the lights on and it was a beautiful day. There was even a breeze on the porch. The clouds were thin, but very clear, a little light was coming from the ocean, a tropical breeze was gently blowing in from the east. I put on my sunglasses and took my bag and headed home, not knowing what was to come.</p> <p>I made my way to my place and put on my pajamas, they were so nice, my hair was a little wet and the straps made it look as though they were still very wet, but it wasn't. I laid on the couch and slowly closed my eyes again. I couldn't move. Why did I open my eyes? I could feel it. It was like a wave. It was moving up and down, and I felt it, and as it reached my breasts, I could feel the nipples tingling.</p> <p>As my fingers touched myself, I could feel them harden, but it didn't push anything down. Instead, I could feel my body respond, it made me feel sexy, and I could feel another wave of tension. When I finally took my fingers out, there were the familiar tingling feeling inside. It was like nothing I had felt in a long time. I lay there and felt it move and it moved from the top of the folds of my body down to the bottom. Slowly and gently I felt the tingling intensify. I couldn't help it. As it made it way down my legs and the tops of the thighs, I felt it slowly and deliberately move back up and away again. That was it, I felt it, as I couldn't stop the tingling, it was all I could ever remember. It was all that had started this and that was what I was going to experience for several days.</p> <p>The tingling stopped and I heard the sound of my cell phone vibrating in my hand againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
