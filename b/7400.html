Oh yes, yes, oh yes..."</p> <p>And suddenly he began to cum inside me and I held on to him for dear life as he thrust into me hard again and harder.</p> <p>"That's it," he said, "that's it, I'm going to cum inside you. I can feel the cum in me. It feels so good. I'm cumming soon too, and I want it to cum again and again."</p> <p>I heard his voice and I knew that all of that was too much for him to handle. My legs went weak and he leaned back, withdrawing his cock and laying upon my leg so that he could put my pussy as a puddle beneath his body. He kissed me softly on the lips and then began to thrust slowly and methodically, his whole body moving as his penis slid over me as it was buried in me. In a few minutes it became too much and I found myself moaning and gasping for breath as his penis rammed into my vagina with a sudden force and I found myself lifting to meet his cock as it rammed into my opening and the sensations overcame me as I was overcome by lust and desire. He didn't make me cum again though and it was too much.</p> <p>"Oh God I'm cumming, I'm so close. It's cumming, I'm cumming on you, oh fuck, hold me," I heard myself screaming and felt my vagina throb and grip his penis as he held himself inside me. As my vagina had just let go, he thrust hard inside me and pushed me into the floor once more as he held himself in place. It seemed that I had never been kissed that way before.</p> <p>"Oh Jesus yes, fuck, I'm cumming, oh fuck yes. Fuck I'm cumming," I screamed and felt my vagina pulsing as I tried to keep control over an orgasm, but his penis stayed firmly in place and the feeling of his cock as it slid inside me made me lose control again as my orgasm took over me.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhh, that's so good. I think I'll cum again if you hold me," I moaned as my body shook with my climax. He kissed me again on the mouth and I realized that his penis was still deeply embedded in me. It's softness on my naked flesh and I could feel his warm cum on my skin as it began to seep through and flow between us to cover my entire body. I felt wetness on my legs again and found my hand to my crotch as I rubbed myself. I'd never touched myself before and it was a shock to touch myself in that way. And it felt good, especially when he held me in that position. I felt his cum inside me and then it began to run down my body as he slowly withdrew his penis and I felt it slide deliciously down until it rested on my swollen clitoris.</p> <p>"That felt so good," I groaned, "it feels good to come from your penis."</p> <p>"It's been so long," he said, smiling as he kissed me, "I was just hoping you wouldn't mind."</p> <p>He slid his penis almost all the way out and looked at it for a minute, then leaned up toward me and kissed me. "This is the first time someone ever came on me that way. I couldn't feel anything else," He said.</p> <p>"That's nice. That feels nice." And I felt my vagina again grip his penis as I felt the first of many orgasms taking me by surprise as he lay with his back on the floor and his face just inches from mine. And then I felt him turn his body and I could feel him moving slowly over me.</p> <p>"You feel really good lying there, aren't you?" I asked him. As I turned into him my breasts were now touching and he could feel his penis slide across my chest as it felt different and alive from anything else. And then he moved his body again and I felt what had started as a feeling of contentment growing in the area of my sex.</p> <p>"I'm still feeling that way too but there's some good news," he said with a grin. He got up onto the bed so that he could lie with my breasts hanging down over him.</p> <p>"Oh yes, you feel really good," I said, and he responded with one of his own. "This was what being the head of our little club turned into. That meant going to work. That was something else."</p> <p>As he said that, I felt the change in his body, then something else, like a different sensation. As he began to move, it felt different but it was no less pleasurable. I knew that this was another new aspect, too. His penis began to move over my breasts as I felt every little bump against the underside of my breasts as it passed the top of my breast.
