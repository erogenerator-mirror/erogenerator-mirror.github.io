The first was so much more intimate. He held me around the middle and I enjoyed his tenderness with it. His arms were a bit longer and thicker and my breasts came into view while he pulled me up against his body and massaged my breasts and belly. He kissed me and massaged both of us. Then he lifted me up around the top of his body and carried me to the pool. He dropped my on it and took the seat up on the side. I felt the seat slide easily to sit on while he held my legs up out in the water and moved his body up between.</p> <p>My knees were bent at the knees and wide apart as his hands cupped my pussy. He spread my lips apart and placed his face on mine. His tongue found my clit and began probing my slit as his fingers moved inside me. It seemed like a dream to me when my eyes remained closed. I couldn't focus on anything, but the feelings of his fingers moving in and out, his thumb playing with my clit, the smell of his beard on my skin....and that feeling of complete abandon. It wasn't long before I was moaning and shuddering and coming all over his mouth. His face was soaked and he held me tight against him as we both fell on the floor, me on top and he on top. We kissed each time I orgasmed but he wouldn't let me move until he had one long orgasm in him.</p> <p>I was exhausted when he dropped me down off him in the pool. We sat holding each other and watching some of the activity. There was some discussion around how it felt for him to be so intimate. The conversation moved on as neither of us was about to be judged. He was so different that I knew it wasn't in his character to judge others. He held out his hand to me as we embraced and I took it and we took a deep breath and went in his arms.</p> <p>We walked slowly to the chaise lounge and he sat down on it. He pulled off his t-shirt and threw it on the floor. I looked down at his body with my eyes and felt no shame, or shame I had felt when I watched him. And it wouldn't be the first time. I could almost see just how large his cock was as I watched it move. It had only grown from his belly and was at least eight inches long. I stared at his head, which was huge and beautiful, with the most beautiful pinkish red flesh in the world. I watched as his cock twitched, got erect and got hard. I felt like a cat, unable to stop it.</p> <p>There was no pressure or any need for me to take it. I just watched as his muscles and tendons moved with his body as he moved his hands up and down from his hips and down to his legs. I could see his pubes when they were touching mine and I was thinking that if we were to end it all the time. I liked all the sexual play we had done as young kids before and while it hadn't lasted long, as I think maybe it had, it did last longer and lasted longer. After only having it in my mouth I was enjoying it thoroughly. His face appeared between my legs and he began to eat my pussy. I had never had more than one orgasm and could feel it in my belly down to my pussy. My breath came in short little gasps and my legs shook. I knew that as soon as I finished it I would be ready to fall down and make love with him again. And once again it would be in me.</p> <p>Finally he stood and held my arms. He lifted me up and held me against him. We stayed like that for long moments as my arms wrapped around him and I felt his cock slowly pushing against my skin when it got it's large head inside me. He moved his body to me and we kissed a long and passionate kiss. He began moving it as I raised a leg and wrapped it around him. We rocked against each other and moved in slow motions. We felt him go deep inside me and press against my cervix. I came again before he was completely all inside me.</p> <p>The one thing that mattered most to me was his love for me. I kissed him and hugged him as the rest of the group came up to us. They held my hands and rubbed my body against them. I held each woman as my hands moved over each of them. They didn't want to take the burden off of me. The last time we had sex was the day I had it with Paul; not only in the parking lot, but in the pool and the beach. His seed entered me on the grass and water. And his beautiful cum. I loved and loved this feeling again. He lifted me and set me on top of him. I began riding him, my pussy moving in and out but taking my time to rub around inside of my channelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
