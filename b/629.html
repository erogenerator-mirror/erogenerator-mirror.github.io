So it feels like we're in a bathroom or a big bedroom," she said with a sly smile.</p> <p>"We use to be in the dark, so it's cool, it's okay, we can just go at it."</p> <p>"This is weird."</p> <p>"Mmm, and good, because it feels weird being naked in here," she said, then paused for a moment before going on. "And my brother was always naked, and the first time he went naked, I got so jealous and hurt, I got the whole damn family naked for my Uncle Joe's birthday. It made me feel like a fucking freak and a whore. We always took our clothes off together, so it was different, but I liked it. And Uncle Joe was my Uncle Joe's favorite brother. I'd never go to bed with him without thinking about all the girls I used to go to church with and all that shit. I got horny and a lot of things just wanted to get into my head to have sex all night. But it just happened," she added, giving me that look her eyes seemed to know that she'd just committed suicide.</p> <p>"This is weird, huh?"</p> <p>"Maybe a little, but we got into it, so we were fucking all night. Maybe we should have gone to a hospital, if we could have. I wouldn't have gotten up like this if we were in front of people's families all day, or worse, a whole party. And I guess even we never came back until last night," she said, smiling and biting her lip as she spoke.</p> <p>"You have to have all of it in me, okay? I want to feel you inside me."</p> <p>"Okay," she said, smiling and kissing me for the first time. Now we'd really had that out of the way for tonight. I was surprised that she didn't really think that I could get it up with my brother. I hadn't wanted to fuck her, I had just been trying to figure out just how far she would want me to go.</p> <p>"And you don't see any of us," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"We don't fuck when I go to church, especially for my father's birthday. But if we were in a room at a night club looking for sex, I don't think this church would hear us," I replied, trying to be smart.</p> <p>"So when are they going to teach us about sex if we're here?" she asked.</p> <p>"We are always going to be in it, and I think I've already found the right answers to the questions."</p> <p>"You sure you don't want to go home with the boys?" she asked, giving this look.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied with a grin and a shrug.</p> <p>"They seem to be pretty open minded," she said with a twinkle in her eye. "Maybe the boys will open up to more questions." She leaned in and kissed me then, slowly at first, but quickly increasing the pressure. I let her kiss me, knowing that I was about to make her want to do it.</p> <p>"I'm ready to do it," I whispered.</p> <p>"I'm glad," she murmured, then pushed me away. "I was going to, but I guess I'll have to find out where I'll be."</p> <p>"You should go home and find out," I teased, looking down at my pants while she looked up at her ceiling.</p> <p>"Don't even think about going, it'll be too late." I was surprised that she actually thought that. If only she had come to a better understanding of the implications of what we were doing, our relationship wouldn't be this hard, I hoped.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied, still hoping that she'd go. "Yeah, but that doesn't mean that I can't be a slut, okay? That's not the way to go. You just have to learn what happens. It doesn't mean anything after that."</p> <p>"Okay, okay. But just remember, I'm your Uncle Joe's wife. And no fucking or blowjobs. And no masturbation when you've fucked my sister." She gave me a big hug, pressing her big boobs against me and lifting my face to hers. "Plus, I don't want to be the only one who's gonna be naked when I come to Jesus' birthday," she added.</p> <p>"I think you're getting kind of old," I replied with a laugh.</p> <p>"You're not old, you're young. And that can be good for you," she said, putting her hand on my arm which she placed on my chest. "But just remember. It doesn't mean, well, that we're going to do it the wrongâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
