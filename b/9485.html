He pointed to his cock, "or the idea of getting laid" I thought, as I turned to look up hopefully.</p> <p>"Well, not just about that!"</p> <p>I was on my side, with his cock at my lips, and his hand at my tit as we watched the porn. This was getting to be the closest we'd ever seen to fucking me. I'm sure that he was getting close to blowing his load right there in front of me. But what if I chickened out? What if he didn't get off any time soon?</p> <p>"We can try all we want."</p> <p>I could see a couple of his fingers sliding up between my legs as he talked to me, and I found myself responding. By that time my nipple, hard as a rock, had slipped a bit and I was really getting excited.</p> <p>I had always had a fantasy about watching another man fuck me, usually with a woman present. It really did turn me on and it was pretty sexy as well, but it never really gave me an orgasm. I knew he was going crazy watching me, and the idea of getting fucked was really hot. I started playing with my pussy, sliding my fingers inside me and rubbing my clit again as I watched and fingered myself.</p> <p>He got up and put one hand over my head and the other around my tit as they swayed there before him. Then he stood above me and started to move a few quick little thrusts into my face.</p> <p>"Let me fuck that pussy, baby," he said, and he slid his cock deep into me again, and started fucking me again, this time with all five or six of his fingers. His hands were on my back, and one of his fingers slipped down from my tit to my clit. He started to move his cock in and out of me faster, in my hand, feeling my own body as he did. I started to feel an orgasm coming on and my breathing got heavier as his pace increased. I started to feel my pussy tightening as soon as his fingers touched my clit I was about to cum again as his cock slammed into me harder. He knew that I was close, too, as my whole body tensed.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" I screamed as he suddenly lifted his face, and my legs fell out from under.</p> <p>I gasped, as he stood there a little way down the center of the bed, with his cock in my mouth, and my hand over my pussy for a minute. It was the biggest orgasm of my life, and I was in such a rush that I could have done it all over again. I just couldn't find the strength to say anything. He just smiled as I hung onto the corners of the bed as the orgasm racked my body. Even being a virgin I knew what that felt like, and I think he could hardly wait either.</p> <p>Eventually though, he said he was done for the night and that I was welcome to fuck him, even if I didn't join him. He didn't bother dressing as I lay there feeling him on me but his arms were around me, his cock inside me.</p> <p>"I'll see you here tomorrow morning! Let's go watch a movie!" he said, and he kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>For that time, I spent the day in a blissful fog, feeling his cock sliding up into me as I felt my pussy squeezing him. It became hard to walk, and I had to get off the bed.</p> <p>In the shower, we talked about how his body and mine felt on our first day. I liked what had happened, being fucked by him, and he wanted to share with me.</p> <p>For all our activities, we always had an orgasm out of it, but as soon as I'd finished my shower I went into the bedroom and pulled out my "cock" (his words) and started masturbating it to the same rhythm he was giving himself. After a while, I stopped.</p> <p>"Where did that come from?" I asked, looking down at myself and feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because I want to fuck you."</p> <p>"Fuck? I'm not gay!"</p> <p>"No I'm not!" I yelled, and with that, I turned the shower on, and pulled off my clothes. He went and got the wash gel.</p> <p>He started to soap and start at my ankles, kissing the backs of each of them, and then slowly worked his way up. First he worked his way back to my knees, and began to wash me again. Again he moved up, slowly, deliberately, to my pussy. His arm and hand kept brushing it off as I shivered with pleasure, feeling his caressâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
