What?"</p> <p>"Just find out."</p> <p>"I dunno, Sam. How do I know you're gonna be my roommate?"</p> <p>"I'm not going to ... just find out," Sam said, "but if you find out that we're on the outs here, we're on the losing side."</p> <p>"If we're on the outs, Sam, I'll get it!" I said, "How am I going to survive here without you getting fired?"</p> <p>"This could be pretty bad," Sam growled, "If you come along and help set up the house in the basement, I guess I'd be all right."</p> <p>"Hey," I said, "don't beat yourself up over this."</p> <p>"Yeah, right," Sam said, "But what you're gonna do is help me get into the closet. I don't like being away from you."</p> <p>"Just get on your knees and tell me what's going on."</p> <p>"You don't want to hear this, do you?"</p> <p>"Don't say it, okay?"</p> <p>"I'm gonna tell you, but you have to promise to not tell anyone I do what it's like. If anything goes wrong, I'll go home, and you can just keep living with me, like I said." Sam leaned forward and her eyes got darker, "Or we can just do it my way. All you have to do is tell me, and it'll be over." Sam closed her eyes tightly and then she leaned back.</p> <p>I could imagine that. I could see her tears. "I don't agree that is a good idea... but I need to tell you something. I was feeling a little... down, back and forth... this morning, when I felt kind of... a strong sexual urge," Sam spoke hesitantly.</p> <p>"Like a sexual urge?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes....."</p> <p>"Asexual desire?" I prompted.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Then I need to know," I said, "How you'd feel? Like I'm going to come out? How you'd feel?" I was getting impatient so I added, "It just might get a little bit weird... so you can find someone in a place you are comfortable seeing?"</p> <p>Sam's eyes got even darker. "I'm not saying anything else," she said.</p> <p>"I know. It could be fun. Just be your own boss." And then all hell broke loose. Sam sat bolt upright and I could see the tears flowing down her cheeks.</p> <p>"Sorry."</p> <p>"Yeah, you can still be on your knees."</p> <p>"I do want to make up for this," Sam said, sniffling, "But I don't think I can make it tomorrow."</p> <p>"I think you could be on your knees right now," I said and reached out a hand. Sam held her hand, and then both my hands were on her. She sobbed in my arms and I could feel the tears streaming from her eyes, soaking me. Sam got me off, and then she sat back in my lap.</p> <p>"You don't have to go." Sam said. She was looking at the clock... there was twenty seconds to go.</p> <p>"And I'm not going to be just your boyfriend?"</p> <p>Sam looked up again. "Oh no, that's not what I meant! I don't want you to take advantage of me like I did... I'm not that way!"</p> <p>Sam leaned back in my arms and sobbed. I held her close. It seemed like only moments passed by, before Sam let go and sobbed. She leaned her head back against my shoulder and then she said something that made me think I knew the answer.</p> <p>"So. I won't be just your roommate. Right?"</p> <p>"Right..." Sam repeated.</p> <p>"I think it's a good thing this place is so... clean and sanitary," Sam whispered, "And I'll cook and clean."</p> <p>"And we'll see," I agreed.</p> <p>"I am so sorry," Sam whimpered.</p> <p>"I'm not," I assured her, "And you have to feel good about that, too."</p> <p>Sam looked at me and nodded. "I do," she said, "I just needed to remind me... that what we shared today was, we've been doing all we could do for a little while, before we even considered it."</p> <p>Sam had gone from a nervous and worried virgin to an attentive, loving, affectionate, sexual, lover. She had a lover now, someone she could be with and be loved, and she had someone now that just a little bit of pain could bring her.</p> <p>"This is a good timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
