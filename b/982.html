David pushed her back, as she squealed like a naughty child.</p> <p>"I'm sure," she whispered, before grabbing the tie she had forgotten. She tugged at the knot, the material stretching before snapping. He could see her soft breasts pressed into his chest and a grin slid across his lips. She ran her hands up his arms, her fingers grazing his skin. He shivered at her touch and her smile as she did so. "It's time for you," she smiled, before sliding the tie off his neck and dropping it on the ground. David's hair was now a mess of silky strands flowing down to the ground. She took his hand, pulling him to a standing position just out of reach, a small puddle of his blood on the grass. Her soft hands explored his body, pausing to circle his nipples, and finally pressing against his crotch. David took a deep breath, his body tensing and the pain in his nipples was almost unbearable. His legs trembled and he fought back the urge to run and lock the door.</p> <p>She knelt down, placing her hands on his thighs. He was still a bit on edge and it seemed she was ready for anything now. She lifted his cock to her mouth and began to lick the shaft, tasting the saltiness of his blood and the tangy pre cum. Her fingers wrapped around the base of his cock and she began to gently stroke it up and down. He watched as she teased his cock, taking the head in her mouth and using her tongue to tickle and flick the skin. He was close to coming, but she wouldn't have any of that. With a moan she engulfed his cock in her warm mouth and began to massage it against the ridges inside of her throat. He was in heaven. And the feel of her tongue sliding along the underside of his shaft made his hips jerk and arch. "That's it..." he moaned, his voice hoarse.</p> <p>"You're going to come," she said, her fingers still gripping the base of his cock as she moved it with slow strokes up and down. "You're not going to come any more."</p> <p>"Don't stop," he said, feeling as though he could go longer. "Oh God, I'm so close!"</p> <p>Her words only prompted his pace to increase, causing her to suck harder on his cock. He pulled her head down onto the base and his body shook in time with her hands. She wrapped her arms around his legs and pressed him down to the grass. Her mouth pressed against his cock and all he could think was that she was the most beautiful, sexiest creature he had ever encountered. Her hair fell softly around her face and she kissed David just above his balls. She released the base of his cock, taking the head in her mouth. He moaned as the pleasure of that sensation overcame him and he felt himself begin to tremble. He knew she had to have had it in her mouth. But he didn't care if she did swallow it. He wanted to come.</p> <p>He felt the first spurt of his come shooting down her throat. She moaned and continued to suck, her lips forming a tight fist around his cock. She milked his dick in her mouth, milking out more of his semen to please her. David couldn't stop his moan from escaping into her mouth as his cock erupted and his hips jerked up in time with the spasms. He felt a warmth flooding through his hips, the tingling and tension in his balls finally giving way to the pleasure she could bring him. Her wet lips pressed against his dick, the suction keeping her mouth wet and luscious beyond belief. The feeling of her warm, wet mouth was incredible. With a smile, she released her grip on his cock and stood before him. "That was incredible..." she whispered, brushing her fingertips against the skin of his stomach.</p> <p>He smiled and nodded. Her lips were puffy and her lipstick was smeared. He couldn't resist one more lick. She giggled when she felt his soft penis pressing into the crack of her ass.</p> <p>"I'll bet you that it was pretty," she said, a grin creasing her lips.</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked it," he replied. "Are you ready to go?" he added.</p> <p>"Absolutely," she said, her lips quirking into a half smile again. "Can we go back out if you want?" She asked, before looking him in the eye. "I need a break."</p> <p>"Of course." He stood up, reaching down to give her a kiss. "You can do whatever you want, my love...," he said, his lips trailing over hers.</p> <p>After they finally parted, David took her hand and ledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
