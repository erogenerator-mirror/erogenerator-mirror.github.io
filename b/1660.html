He just smiled and took a sip of brandy, his eyes focused on her. "They do get so loud sometimes," she added quickly.</p> <p>"I can assure you that they do get a bit loud. Especially when a girl is going to take care of them for a little while before they leave," Alex explained.</p> <p>"Well if you get to fuck my boyfriend, you can come home to me, you know."</p> <p>"Are you really serious?" Alex said as he sipped more of the brandy. "I mean, do you really think he'd actually fuck me if he came home home tonight? Really? Or would you feel bad?"</p> <p>"I don't know, babe." There was a definite sexual heat growing in her eyes, even though she hadn't even noticed. "He might get suspicious if he comes home. Hell, he might get caught up in the moment."</p> <p>"I think you're right, but you can tell him we're going to be spending night at her apartment," Alex said, giving her another wink.</p> <p>"You're just saying that, sweetheart. He'll love that."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>"I feel so bad for him," she stated as she set the brandy down in her lap again. "That was so nice, and all I'd really wanted was to go with you to your place but all my luck," she admitted as she wiped away a tear. "So this is what we had anyway. So I'll have plenty of opportunity to see you and your boyfriend all the time, whenever he's home."</p> <p>"If you're that turned on, I'm too," he said as he leaned closer. "I'm just curious what you're going to say when I come home."</p> <p>"Allright." She had a mischievous grin. "But first, I have to warn you, I'd be a lot more comfortable in my own apartment, and with you with you there I don't mind sharing." He leaned in and kissed her, allowing her access to him in an almost instant. Their tongues played together with ease as they kissed, with Alex's hand finding her breasts for the first time, while his other hand found the small, firm flesh within her jeans. When he broke his soft embrace, he pulled away just long enough to catch his breath.</p> <p>"I'm going to ask you a question, but please, you've got to promise me this right here in the kitchen, in front of everyone." He grinned at her questioningly and she nodded, knowing that she needed just that answer, and it would be the last one she would ever ask him until he was gone.</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"You know that I'm gay." It was the first time he had asked her, that he had meant it to, to be honest. It had been a long time since she'd told him. The one time that a guy had asked her was the last time that she'd ever let him know that she was gay. It made sense now, that she had never asked him before, and even though they both were just friends until now, there was so much more between them then met with mutual agreement. He grinned at her and she wondered if he was even aware of what she had just said.</p> <p>"I'm not gay," he replied as he smiled at her, hoping her answer would be the same.</p> <p>"But I'm not straight," she insisted. "Don't you think that it would be cool if I kept my lesbian side for a while longer?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess so," he agreed, not wanting to seem too forward. Alex was used to being able to take charge, and having to share her, a bit. He knew that she had been in the same situation that he had been in, but she was willing to admit it, or at least ask it of him. He shrugged his shoulders at her and gave her a wink. "I guess I could live with that."</p> <p>"So long, Alex," she said teasingly.</p> <p>"Maybe I'll come over for dinner."</p> <p>"Maybe another time, but for now, let's go back to bed. Now that I've had all of your sexy company, I thought we might as well just finish the rest."</p> <p>"You're right, I'm going to make a good impression." He was still a tad unsure about her answer but not a one of them. They were going to do the same thing.
