A minute later he came around to her side of the truck, looked down at her, "Come on in," he said. She followed him back down the narrow road down to the office, where he pulled the door close. He leaned over to her and said, "I wanted to do this before we left. I have to be there when you come back," and he gave her a kiss that seemed to go on and on. He looked over at him and saw that he had brought his own cock back and he was not looking at her as he held it out.</p> <p>They pulled up to the building at a quarter to seven. When they got out, he had her strip while he sat in the car waiting on a turn signal. She got in the back of the van and he put her over his shoulder with her head down at a forty degree angle. He turned the van into the street so it was going directly to her truck so they could get out of it. She got out then grabbed the zipper in the back, "I think I'm ready," she said. He was grinning at her and she wondered how long it would take before he was coming.</p> <p>After they got a turn he leaned down and kissed her cheek. She turned and opened her door as he got into the driver's seat, turned off the headlights and backed them off the road. She put her hands on his shoulders and felt his hand run across her bare abdomen and touch her belly button. It felt nice and he pulled her over his lap and she felt the cold steel of his hands as he pulled her skirt up just far enough to feel her heat. She felt him turn on the gas and get them over and then had him drive slowly back to the office building. There was nothing but silence for fifteen miles in the front of his van. By the time he got back they had both pulled over in front of the office building and were heading back to her. She hadn't even heard the door open but she looked around to see her boss come out. He put the van into park and she got up and followed him back to the van. She was still sitting there, waiting for him and when he got out she climbed back into the van.</p> <p>He put his hand in her coat and she felt suddenly naked. She saw the look of surprise on his face. His finger reached under her to touch her nipple through the thin fabric of her t-shirt. With little finesse he had her nipples as hard as little stones. Before she knew it her nipples were like stones through the fabric as well. He pulled her nipple up hard and twisted it in his fingers as he pulled it between her tits and pushed them together. He was enjoying the feeling as he looked at her. She was almost crying. He held her nipple and felt it growing even more between his fingers as she tried to get up against him. She could feel her sex getting really, really wet as she leaned back against his knee. He just looked at her through half his eyes and watched her. He didn't think he was that way. He wanted to show her the real her.</p> <p>He reached under her skirt, under her panties. She felt the cold air on her thighs which caused her wetness to flow. He bent to take the first nipple in his mouth. It was a shock as his lips pressed it up hard against his tongue and he sucked for all he was worth. For a while she thought he was going to make her explode in his mouth but she was not about to stop being afraid of what she was feeling. The kiss seemed to get hotter and hotter. When it broke off as she was breathing heavy and she felt sure he had to be getting close to exploding just from the way her breasts were dancing against his chest and he had his face buried in her cleavage. He pulled back and she almost screamed when she heard his zipper go down and heard a little moan before he pulled the rest of her clothes off.</p> <p>"Are you ready to be fucked?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered, almost breathless.</p> <p>"Are you ready to be fucked?" he asked again.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, her voice getting harder and sexier with each word.</p> <p>"Would you like for us to get it on?" he asked.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said.</p> <p>"Get naked, "he said, "and put your hands in the back seat."</p> <p>"Yes," she said. Then she started the engine. She felt his hand on her knee as the seat started to move and as the door slid forward she felt the hard flesh of his cock pushing between her thighs. They moved to and she opened and moved over the seat. He was just pulling her skirt up at the bottom of the back.
