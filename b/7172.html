He couldn't keep out all of this. It was getting more and more frustrating when he saw the woman reach over and give her husband a light slap as a thank you. She couldn't go on forever and when she did she would be walking out of the house and down the road again. It was bad enough, but the whole thing was humiliating.</p> <p>'Are you ok?' he asked.</p> <p>'Yes,' Mary answered, 'I didn't mean to get in such a hurry. You just shocked me, and I can't even put my shoes back on.'</p> <p>'No, it's ok, you know you're the one I have been trying to get over.' A look of worry filled his heart.</p> <p>He knew Mary would understand. She was never like that. ***</p> <p>"It's going well. They're doing well. We keep making them. You know what I'm talking about, don't you?"</p> <p>He nodded and then gave Mary a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"Have you told anyone yet?"</p> <p>"No. I really wish the dance was finished, but I can't seem to find you. Why is this happening?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I thought I could make you feel better."</p> <p>Mary shook her head. "You don't have to worry about that. You'll just get better with time. You know you want to dance with somebody."</p> <p>He smiled and nodded in agreement. "We're out of champagne and I have to get it out of my system again to get you on your feet. I am very sad when you find someone who will really give you anything. Now I feel like I have no one I trust enough to stay friends with. It won't be long and I'll be ready."</p> <p>A long look at his watch. It was almost midnight. He smiled, thinking about how much fun he had. He really didn't want to waste his time.</p> <p>"We'll be leaving in a couple of hours."</p> <p>"What is it?" Mary asked, not understanding anything.</p> <p>"I have to be on my way right now, but not to my apartment. I'll be there to pick up some things. I will be home around midnight."</p> <p>Mary smiled. "Sounds great. I'll call you as soon as I know where you are and get together with you. I can tell that you really needed this, too."</p> <p>"Thanks. Now get going."</p> <p>He opened the door and walked into what he had described. It really wasn't what he had pictured he had thought of. It was more like what he had seen on MTV: all of the things people talked about. It was a kind of party and it was fun. It was fun to get dressed up for. And it was fun to be a little drunk to do so. Maybe that was just what Mary wanted though, a change of heart. But she could go to hell for doing what she had with Tom so well. Mary turned and pulled out her phone and dialed a number. She let the phone ring when she noticed him standing at the door.</p> <p>"Hello?" She whispered.</p> <p>"This is Tom."</p> <p>Mary answered the call, "Hi, Tom. It's Mary."</p> <p>Tom smiled and then said, "Yes it is. Mary and I are out for the night. So can we join you? We'll have to get you some shoes to keep it warm. I'll pick up some champagne after I get home. We'll be there about 1:30."</p> <p>Mary nodded her head. "Do you have a car yet? You can come and get it now."</p> <p>"Yeah, I have it right here," he said.</p> <p>Mary smiled. "Okay. I told you, he has a special way of staying."</p> <p>"Yeah," Mary muttered. "I have to go back to the house and pick up my things. How can I keep him waiting."</p> <p>"Hey, it's ok," Tom said, "we can go out the window and see if we can find a way to get him over to the dance floor."</p> <p>Mary nodded.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Tom stepped out of the elevator and grabbed the hand that Mary held by the arms as they headed towards the front of the house. Mary shook as she watched the people pass by.</p> <p>"How is he? Is he ok?" He heard her ask.</p> <p>"He's fine. He told me that he didn't understand what was happening tonight with you. He wanted to come out and do something. When we got there, he saw that we hadn't brought our thingsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
