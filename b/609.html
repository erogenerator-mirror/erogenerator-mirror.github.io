Do you love me?"</p> <p>She lifted her left eye to meet mine once again, and then nodded back to him as he slid down the bed until his face was inches from her moist and swollen lips. The lips of her sweet pussy were shining and swollen, glistening in the lamp.</p> <p>He slowly ran his tongue out and down the line formed by the lips, circling the inside of her mouth, just as he had done before. Her tongue was long and wet and when her tongue met him he took that as his cue to gently push it into her mouth. He slowly stroked his tongue along her upper lip as they watched each other. She shivered at the contact, her tongue sliding out to catch his, then she pulled it back into her mouth. Their eyes were glazed over with excitement.</p> <p>She moaned as they kissed, her hand reaching to brush his hair. "Oooh....yesss..." She sighed and brought her arms down to encircle his head. He brought his mouth up to her again, brushing his lips to her right breast, then he began sucking and nipping on that nipple. He rolled her nipple between his lips, then drew his tongue in a spiral back down to her pussy, moving back to suck her nipple again.</p> <p>Her fingers slid under his hair, pulling him down as she started moaning, her hips jerking up slightly as his tongue flicked over her sensitive nipple. He drew his tongue back down and back up to her hard nipple again, before circling her other breast, repeating that movement over and over.</p> <p>Karen rolled her head to the side and arched her back as he lightly brushed his lips and tongue over her nipples and aureole. One hand slid down and slid down between her legs, his mouth kissing her hard on the nipple as his fingers slid into the damp hole created by those lips and fingers. She shivered and moaned and arched her back again.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, David," she moaned. "Lick me there. Oh, lick me there. Eat me here."</p> <p>He raised his finger to her mouth and slowly dragged it across her lips, the tip slipping up and down between them.</p> <p>"What do you call me?" she asked, trying to maintain eye contact with him as her tongue flickered to make contact with his fingertip.</p> <p>"Just what you think," he replied with a smile. "That's an old, silly thing."</p> <p>She looked over at him with a puzzled smile, and pulled her face down to lick his finger. She looked up at him, smiling as she reached to the night stand beside the bed. She pulled out the lubricant, poured some on her hand and coated it along his length with the lube. She ran it along his cock, feeling the silky smoothness, feeling that thick vein that went from the crown down to where her palm rested on his thigh.</p> <p>"Ooh," she breathed as his finger slipped inside her, stretching her open. She felt his finger push the lips aside, then the head of his cock slid inside. She leaned her head down against his belly, her face almost touching his hip. David took this opportunity to press his lips over hers, their mouths opened and their tongues stroked each other as he slowly worked the length of himself inside her.</p> <p>When she felt him bottom out inside of her, she raised her legs higher and spread them wider, pressing herself on his hips and pushing his cock deeper inside of her. She was surprised at how much he was filling her and then at the feeling of fullness. Her legs dropped to his sides and her hips lifted against him. She closed her eyes as her hands moved to hold him, then leaned her knees and hips back and leaned forward until his cock bumped against her cervix.</p> <p>David pulled his hips back and then pulled back as he did. "Is this too much?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, I want you inside me, David," she said. "I'm so hot, I can't believe it, but I'm ready. Take me David. I want it."</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed her again, his lips pressing against hers even as his cock slid inside of her tight pussy. They rocked together in the darkness until she was nearly asleep. He drew his lips up to her ear, his tongue licking it as he whispered, "I want you to feel that."</p> <p>He began pumping into her, fucking her. "I'm going to fuck you David. I'm going to cum inside you. You feel wonderful. I'm going to cum inside you."</p> <p>He slipped his fingers back under her arms to lift her shoulders off the sheets and his arms were at her sides. He raised his hips and pushed himself all the way in, thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
