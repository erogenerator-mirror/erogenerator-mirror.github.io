He thought back to the evening. The girls were all pretty and he was definitely going to make the best of it.</p> <p>"I have to admit, I like your outfit" he said while staring down his black silk shirt.</p> <p>"Thanks, baby." Kyla said with a broad smile. She reached for and grabbed him around the waist and pulled him against her. She felt his breath through the thin silken shirt.</p> <p>"You should see it in the mirror. It's almost as if they wanted you to get some real eye candy," he said as he reached up and ran his hands up the sides of her legs.</p> <p>"That would be so hot, you know," he said.</p> <p>"You're turning me on," she said while continuing to press a thigh against his. He could feel her breath on his neck and suddenly she pulled away. He looked up at her and saw her eyes were glazed with passion.</p> <p>"You've got a lot to teach me," he said while taking her hand in his.</p> <p>"I know, honey," she said while looking deep into his eyes. He felt his heart jump when she put her other in his hand. He ran his hand along her fingers.</p> <p>"Oh, damn," he said as her other hand began to slowly caress his face. "I have to get home and go straight to bed," he said with a smirk. She took her hand off his face and they both turned to go.</p> <p>They came to the bar and it all started when she put her hands over his.</p> <p>"Your hands are incredible, sweetheart," she said as he pressed his body against hers.</p> <p>He leaned his face to hers and gave them a long, deep kiss. She felt her body reacting to his touch.</p> <p>"Are you ready to get home now?" he asked.</p> <p>"Damn, that would be the perfect time. We'll finish here, get a cab, and you can tell your folks and then come home to me."</p> <p>"No, baby, I'm still at school," he said. She ran her fingers through his hair and he pulled her closer to him.</p> <p>"I don't want to take my clothes off," she said while looking into his eyes.</p> <p>He felt an erection coming on in his pants which were straining to stay confined. He had to control himself.</p> <p>"I think we've made some hot, very erotic chemistry," he said with a wicked grin on his face. He pressed himself against her and felt the heat of her body and the scent of her perfume.</p> <p>"I wish I had a pair," she said.</p> <p>"Do they fit?"</p> <p>"I sure wish I had one, but I have to check, don't I?" she said while taking his hand and putting it on her thigh. He gently cupped it and he thought he heard her breathing increase but then she put her head back and they both smiled as she let go of his hand. He pressed his fingers under her, feeling the smoothness of her skin. He was a little surprised with how hard he was.</p> <p>****</p> <p>Sometime later the taxi slid up to the front of the building.</p> <p>"Damn. Looks like we've got a late night ahead of us," the driver said with a laugh as he watched Kyla walk through the glass doors. She stopped about six feet away and leaned back on the door as the driver came to get her.</p> <p>His car smelled like flowers and he hoped that she didn't smell any stinky pussy.</p> <p>"What a great evening, sweetheart," he said smiling as he leaned down to kiss her.</p> <p>****</p> <p>His car smelled like flowers and he hoped she did smell the stench. He could feel it from the driver seat. He looked at her and couldn't help but admire her. She looked like a goddess with her long blond ponytail. Her body was incredible with a tight body and a high, almost bared ass. He was getting hard again right now.</p> <p>"Come in," he said before lifting his eyes up to the driver, who still had his eyes closed. She turned and he slid in the door. She closed the door and leaned back on the seat. She looked so damn beautiful. He glanced around the side of his house. There was one other person in the cab looking their way and he thought he heard someone moaning.</p> <p>"What do you want to do, baby?" he asked.</p> <p>She pulledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
