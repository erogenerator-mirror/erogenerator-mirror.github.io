You're gonna pay for this? You could be really dead," she said, getting up to get her coffee.</p> <p>I didn't like it, and she was right. I didn't get the sense that she meant it, although I had no reason to doubt it. I decided to push things further to my advantage. If she did, I'd have to be a bit more attentive with her when we got home tonight. I'd better get back to work before she had a heart attack—and then we might make more time for each other.</p> <p>"Hey, do you need to come see me again?" I asked her the next evening over the phone.</p> <p>"Why?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Because, that's what a friend does every night, right?" she didn't sound nearly as convinced as I was. "Is that a good thing?"</p> <p>"It's just something we do all the time." I told her. I had more than enough to deal with.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not surprised the way you've been acting tonight. You're a very naughty boy. Have you forgotten why we've been so good to you in the past?"</p> <p>"Yes, but I know you want to do this more than just tonight. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to get you into bed. I wanted to do things for you, I just had to."</p> <p>"That it is. Now that we're done talking, I'll let you get some sleep. See you in the morning." I hung up the phone.</p> <p>I'm not sure how much she really understood what I was feeling, and that I was being a bit more aggressive than was my normal behavior. I had to admit that I was getting a little tired, which did seem like an odd combination.</p> <p>But I did think that it would be much better if I came into work right after that, and we had sex every night, as long as it got past closing time and not doing anything else.</p> <p>I was feeling very good about a lot of things and I was looking forward to spending time with my new pet, a cute little thing named Lizzy. She turned eighteen in a little over a year ago, about twenty years old. She was the spitting image of my former pet, but I hadn't seen her for almost a year. It was nice to get home to her again, because that's where she had been my whole day.</p> <p>I had come home from work to find my sister in the tub, splashing water on her face and trying to get the suds out of her face.</p> <p>"Hey, Lizzy!" I said, a bit surprised. She was still just under ten years old, but I loved to see her try to act like a baby and not have to try to keep a sudsy little teenage girl in the way she would when we were in the bathtub.</p> <p>"I have some work to finish right after school tomorrow." She pulled herself off the side of the tub and headed out. "Do you want your bath ready? Or did you want your dad to come by and help you in the tub?"</p> <p>"I want some of the water so I can use it before we go to class."</p> <p>"That sounds nice." Lizzy looked disappointed that I was still not following.</p> <p>"No, I don't think it's perfect," I said. "The water is fine. And it's not running for any reason."</p> <p>"No it isn't. You're gonna make me think that you haven't been doing a lot of homework. Why don't you go get dinner?"</p> <p>"Sure, fine, why not?"</p> <p>"But just in case, there's something better this way," I suggested.</p> <p>"What better?" she asked, looking genuinely intrigued.</p> <p>"Well, um... um... maybe you should stay in your room? I have a... err... a room."</p> <p>"Oh," Lizzy said, looking a bit confused. We weren't exactly alone. My mother and father would only be a few feet away when we got home.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry." She held her hands in front of her heart on her forehead. "I know you don't want to, but I really don't feel right spending the whole day in our house with you, I'm only eighteen. But, I can't stay in my room. I'm going to have a hard day tomorrow, and I don't want to be late on it."</p> <p>"Don't take that attitude too hard. It's fine. I'm just not comfortable sleeping alone."</p> <p>"OK, I understand. We just want to know what you're thinking."
