I smiled as I stepped closer to the girl. "I want to help you. To do what you really want done to you."</p> <p>"Don't be silly." A low, sexy female voice replied. "You can do it. Or help me."</p> <p>"Oh no." The girl replied as she slowly dropped to her knees in front of me. I watched as she grabbed my cock and tentatively lowered her head towards it. "That'll teach you for a bit." She whispered as she took one of my balls into her warm mouth. "Oh, it feels so good." She moaned as she sucked her way up my shaft. I moaned, my cock slowly returning to its normal size. She started slowly jacking my cock as she took more of it into her mouth. "Do you like it?" she murmured as she lightly grazed my balls.</p> <p>"Yes" I gasped.</p> <p>"Yes what?" she said as she continued her jacking.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh please...oh." I was almost out of my mind. "Please...oh please...pleeeaase"</p> <p>"That's what I want." She replied. "I want you to let me do it." She continued staring at my cock in her hand, her lips wrapped around it, her hand gently stroking me as she sucked and jacked. "Mmm."</p> <p>"Oh my God." I moaned. With one hand on her shoulder, I ran my hand down her neck and chest towards her right breast. "You have beautiful breasts baby." I whispered as I cupped the firm tit and gently massaged it. "And they are beautiful. I love breasts like that." I continued gently squeezing and kneading the soft flesh as my other hand ran from her neck to her pussy. My hand felt soft, warm, wet and slick. I loved it when I played with her tits. They have always excited me and made me so fucking crazy when they were excited. I began to gently rub my middle finger up and down the puffy lips. "Oh god yes." I moaned.</p> <p>"Oh," she replied as she looked across my cock towards him lying naked in front of her. "I just had to say hi." Then she was looking up at me and smiling as she stroked me.</p> <p>"Well, let's go then."</p> <p>With that, I took my hand from her chest, letting the other one fall to her side. I turned her towards me and stood her up. I slowly raised one of her legs and brought it up over the side of the table top. Now I could slide my legs apart a bit. She looked puzzled but I held her. I took my fingers and slowly licked the side of her thigh and slowly brought her towards me just as my tongue was licking her outer lips.</p> <p>"Ohh, that feels so nice. Oh...oh" She hissed as she squirmed. I brought my head closer to her pussy and placed my open mouth over her hot, slippery pussy. "Ohhh." She let out a little moan as her hot breath was quickly exchanged with my mouth. She raised her mouth and mouth from my cock as she looked up at me. "You're really going to...oh...y'. Oh..."</p> <p>"Yes." I replied as I brought my mouth to her pussy again, pushing it against her wet pussy. As I began to lick it up, I was amazed at its softness and tasted her sweet juices. The taste of a woman! It turned me on to think that she found me attractive to her. I could only hope that she knew that. But, as she tasted and smelled so amazingly sweet, how would she know that I loved her?</p> <p>She began to moan again, raising and lowering herself. I brought my tongue slowly up her warm, wet pussy lips. I felt the wet flesh against my tongue and began to lick it as her hips lifted again. She began to push and roll her hips against my mouth and the sensations of my tongue sent waves of pleasure through her.</p> <p>"Oh fuck." She exclaimed as she pressed her hips at me once again. "Oh yes...oh...oh yes..."</p> <p>"Mmm." I began to kiss her thighs now as her hips continued to rise. "I want to make you feel good." I said as I began to spread her legs apart.</p> <p>"Oh fuck." She moaned. "Oh that feels so good!" She pressed her thighs around me as I continued to lick up her sweet pussy lips now. I lapped at the wetness that now coated her lower lips. "Oh!" she said as her hips began to undulate.</p> <p>I lifted and lowered my fingers slowly against her pussy and felt how the lips parted in anticipation.
