I said softly, "Oh don't you worry!"</p> <p>I heard his zipper being opened and the soft sound of his belt slipping off. I felt his hand on the small of my back pulling me back against him as he entered me with one last thrust.</p> <p>We fell together onto the bed in a single breathless kiss. He continued to pound into me a long minute until I felt his orgasm build.</p> <p>"Take me upstairs now you dirty old slob..." He said as he leaned over me kissing me again, "Just don't get your panties dirty!"</p> <p>As we dressed he turned to me, "Now you're going to come home early!" I heard him say with a laugh as he walked out the door.</p> <p>The next morning Mike got out of the shower just before my mother got up to start breakfast for us. He was washing up with my grandmother as he came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me. We shared another hearty kiss before we quickly turned to go. As we got outside the hot sun was out, we walked over to our car, I turned to him and pulled in my car window. We drove into the garage and out into the garage. It took a few seconds but I got my car out and went back in to change. I got out my purse and made my way to the car. Mike stood watching for a few moments as I went around the car.</p> <p>I put the seat in first and locked the back door. My uncle walked around the car looking at me as I got in. "I thought it would be a little cooler back at the house," he joked. I laughed as he climbed in beside me.</p> <p>"Now where were we, that was so nice, thank you!" I said as I closed my top and slid down to his lap. "Do you want something to eat?" I asked, "I just washed your dishes last night and we had some tea, if you want?"</p> <p>"You sure can go for a ride!" He said as he slid on into the driver's seat. "Can I have the eggs? Oh, and we still have to get going."</p> <p>I grabbed his hand and led him off to the side of the house.</p> <p>"There's a garage door up here if you need it." I said.</p> <p>"Not a problem," he said as he closed the door and locked it. "You ready? This is getting pretty late!" he remarked.</p> <p>"I don't know what time it is but I know we're right on the way home." I said as he stood in the middle of the garage.</p> <p>He laughed that deep sexy laugh as he turned and started the car. As he got in, I looked at him closely, trying to read the expression on his face. I finally saw it and knew he liked what he saw.</p> <p>As I drove out of town, I saw a line of cars on a small street that we didn't pass. I could see that several others stopped to pick a spot for a few minutes. They didn't go out that far and many people watched. There were people on the street who were still walking as they continued walking, but a few did look towards us.</p> <p>Mike pulled into the garage and started the car. He backed his car out of the garage and headed for the door. He turned and looked at me as he started the car, "Aren't you going to turn it on?" he asked.</p> <p>I saw his eyes move from my lips down to my cleavage, watching me as he watched my reaction. I saw him smile as he saw my reaction.</p> <p>I turned to him, "Please, I really need to change." I said with a nervous smile.</p> <p>"Don't you need to pee? And do you know how to pee?"</p> <p>"No I didn't think he'd want me to," I replied back as I turned to him, "I can keep the car warm in case you get thirsty."</p> <p>When he started my car, he stopped it. I reached over into the glove compartment and grabbed an arm full of my clothes. "I have to pee!" I exclaimed, "It's really starting warm up in here!"</p> <p>Mike started walking back to where he'd parked. I turned to see him turn the car off. "Let me get this seat warm first!" He said after he opened my door and stepped back to take off his shoes and socks. I started the car and pulled out of the garage. While driving, I took it off and got the seat warm once againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
