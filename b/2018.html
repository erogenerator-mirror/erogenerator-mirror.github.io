She felt the blood draining from his face as he looked up.</p> <p>"I couldn't help myself, Mrs. McNeil. I'm a big boy and I like looking at girls. I found your photos and they look so sexy. I wanted to kiss you there and make love to you," he said.</p> <p>Now it was her turn to blush as she realized how horny and horny he was. It seemed like some time had passed since he was talking to her that way. The desire came to a peak.</p> <p>"Oh no, I didn't mean to be so forward. It's just that...I've never...you know...done that before," he said and smiled.</p> <p>"Well, I suppose I have but not with anyone this close. Is it ok if I just read it then?" she said as she got a huge grin on her face and turned to face him.</p> <p>"I guess you can read it then, but you need to let me see it." He opened the magazine up and saw what he was going to need to finish his research, plus a whole bag of books.</p> <p>"My husband, um, I mean my older brother just read this stuff all the time." She said.</p> <p>"Hah-hu! Well, I've been reading this stuff for years and I've been reading it from my younger brother. Anyway, I was just getting in to it and I was looking at it so I didn't read it from the wrong person. Here, take this!" He said and handed the book.</p> <p>She took the book and held it up so it rested on her thigh. Then, she opened it and a picture of a very thin blond haired girl from a distance came into view. On closer inspection, she realized how beautiful she was.</p> <p>"Wow!" she said. "Now look! It's like something out of a comic book!"</p> <p>He turned the page and was stunned.</p> <p>The page was an old schooler's picture of a boy as he looked at a cute girl. She smiled at him, holding the picture in her hand and then looked at him. He couldn't believe this was really happening. He looked at the front of her dress and could even see some of her legs.</p> <p>"What the hell do you think you're doing?" he said, shocked by what he had just witnessed.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm taking a picture of my date, silly!" she said and giggled.</p> <p>She pulled the zipper down along side the photo and then brought the photo up again with her hands. He watched this image come into view as she began to lift her dress. Her dress quickly followed and again, it appeared as if she stood there, her bare breasts now exposed to him but not completely exposed. She turned to him again with the photo in front of her. She looked around the room with a wicked smile and slowly turned to face him. She lifted the dress up to her waist and then slowly slid the dress off all the way to the floor.</p> <p>"Come on, sweetheart," she said, as she walked over to him and lifted both her wrists and held them above her head. She walked over his lap, her legs splayed apart as she leaned her head in towards him.</p> <p>"Now," she said, "You can put this book back to finish your work. I don't have all afternoon to waste! I just have to put this little scene out of my head." As she said that she ran her hands along his thighs and stomach.</p> <p>Her hands worked their way under his undershirt as she began caressing his stomach and breasts.</p> <p>"I can't tell what's on your mind but let me see this!" He said as he pulled up her top over her head. He saw that she wore no bra underneath.</p> <p>"No bra? I think you're so cute as to have those gorgeous, big brown tits out of their T-shirts all by yourself!"</p> <p>She pulled off his shirt and threw it on the chair behind her. Then she moved in closer. "You like looking at me?" she said as she looked at his chest.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I do!" he said as he reached his hands out and gently rubbed her left breast. Her nipples responded the same way her clitoris did. She could feel her lips begin to swell as she looked at his reaction.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm glad you like my boobs," she said in a sexy voice. She pushed her chest closer into his hands.</p> <p>"You're my daughter's age, not your brother's," he said as he continued to rub her breast.</p> <p>"No, I just meant it.
