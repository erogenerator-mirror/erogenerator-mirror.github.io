She bent down, kissing her ass, then her pussy, moving towards the toilet and taking her panties off, moving her legs as she pulled them off. She looked up at his face then turned to face the wall, putting her hands on the wall, moving her ass to him.</p> <p>He moved over the toilet, sitting down next to her. He rubbed his hand, pressing his palm against her leg.</p> <p>"Oh, that you did that, you did it."</p> <p>She leaned over, putting her hand gently against the back of his shorts.</p> <p>"Yes, you did, baby. You made me feel good."</p> <p>He stroked her leg as he reached down and started massaging her pussy through her clothes. She pulled on the top of his shorts, pulling it up a little, then slid them down. His cock was still hard as stone, pressing against his shorts as he rubbed her pussy.</p> <p>She turned away, putting her panties on, taking them off and putting her hands on the wall.</p> <p>"That is so cute. Are you hard now, like last night when we were just teasing you?" She asked him, pressing her tits against his chest, rubbing her ass all the way.</p> <p>She turned and faced him again, leaning in towards him, kissing him again. His cock pressed against her as he pulled her up to him, kissing her, his hands rubbing her back. He moved down to her waist, kissing her neck, then kissing her ear, then her earlobe. He kissed down her neck and over her shoulder, stopping and moving her to get to her neck. He slowly sucked her neck, pulling her up a little then letting her drop back down. He kissed down her neck again, going further down to her collarbone, sucking and nibbling on one of her nipples. He rubbed her ass and pussy up and down against the wall again, still massaging one of her tits, which was still hanging out of her bra. He could feel them against him. His cock was rock hard now.</p> <p>He stood up, walking her to the bed. She lay down and he knelt before her, rubbing her stomach as his hands reached under her skirt, rubbing and lifting her pussy through her panties.</p> <p>He knelt beside her, rubbing the front of her panties, moving the fabric over her clit, slipping his fingers into her, feeling her cum for him, sliding her pussy around his fingers, rubbing her clit again. He pulled her panties off to give him easier access to her cunt, rubbing and slipping his fingers into her.</p> <p>She moaned and pushed up against his hand, moaning loudly.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she hissed.</p> <p>He slipped two fingers into her, feeling as if he would never be able to get to her cervix. This time, he pulled her lips apart and slid his thumb over her clit.</p> <p>"Yes baby, yes, rub my clit." She cried out, as soon as her words had the desired effect. She moved so her ass was laying along the side of the bed, with her hands on the wall. She slid her body up to his hand, letting his thumb go into her again, then pulling it out from time to time. Her breath was heavy and quick, as soon as it was, the pressure in her body changed and she climaxed hard, her body shaking as she orgasmed against his hand, making a noise almost animal.</p> <p>As soon as his hand was soaked with her cum, he stood up, standing with her, still hard, still inside her. They kissed softly, her arms held around his neck. Their kiss soon led to his hands running over her body. Her arms fell from around his neck as she grabbed her clothes.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she said, as she sat down and pulled her panties on, buttoning them.</p> <p>They sat down on the side of the bed, kissing again, her hands rubbing his bare chest.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, I am so sorry about that."</p> <p>She smiled, running her fingers through his chest hair.</p> <p>"Why? What's wrong? Where's that going?"</p> <p>"We need to be alone today, okay?" She paused. "And we haven't even started yet. What are you thinking?"</p> <p>"Is that all it has been?" He reached down to move his fingers off the side of her leg, sliding them along her thigh.</p> <p>"Yes. I understand. But where was I?"</p> <p>He moved his hand back to her hip, then slid his fingers down along her side, moving to the side of her thigh, reaching her hips, up her stomachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
