I'd never been one for sex but the idea of a hot couple of hours and my husband walking in the lobby had me so horny I didn't care. I had been dreaming about being with them all night and was ready for it.</p> <p>Just as I pulled into the parking lot, I saw my car in the lot, I knew it was Jason's but my mind wanted more. We got out of the car and hurried over to the hotel, I fumbled his keys and got out.</p> <p>I walked in the lobby with the door slightly open so I could see all of the people enter and I was the first to notice that some were staring at me and I felt their eyes burning into my body. They watched for awhile with drinks in their hands before they were ready to take a bite.</p> <p>We headed up to the room, I grabbed a soda and started to get ready. As I finished, I walked over to him and gave him a deep open mouth kiss, my tongue was already in his mouth and I could taste the cum in the kiss.</p> <p>I looked at him, he still had his eyes closed and was feeling my boobs through my shirt. He reached for and started to unbutton my shirt, it fell to the floor. He slid his hand over my breasts and gave them a squeeze before leaning in and giving a little nibble on some of my nipples.</p> <p>"You are so damn sexy when you are horny," he told me.</p> <p>"Thank you, I have been looking forward to this," I answered back with a smile and started walking to where I'd left my car.</p> <p>I opened the door and walked in, still feeling the effects of having his cum in my pussy, knowing my husband would be there to watch. I went back to the hotel table and sat down and started feeling another orgasm. I thought I was going to make him stop after a few minutes but my hands were free so I decided not to. I didn't want Jason to know I was getting ready to have an orgasm.</p> <p>He walked in with a tray of food that wasn't mine and took it from my hands. He took a seat in a chair across from me and started eating his food. The first thing I started thinking was how close I was to a wet spot on his pants. He looked back at me with a smile and gave me that familiar smile he'd used on me on the way home the other night.</p> <p>I looked down at the food in my hands as he finished his food. There was more that made him smile. I could not take it anymore. I took a chance and let him know that was what I wanted but it was in not good use. I just said okay as I looked in his eyes.</p> <p>"Let's get out of here," I said as I stood up from the seat. "Let me pay my bill."</p> <p>"Let's go," he whispered and followed me out the door.</p> <p>We walked up to the elevator and as the doors shut I reached over and put my hand on the back of his head and slowly pulled it down to my boobs. His lips gently kissed my nipples which made me feel like I couldn't get enough. I gently pushed the back of his head down and pulled it to my boobs and he sucked one of my nipples into his mouth.</p> <p>"Mmmm," I moaned as I looked to see what was going on.</p> <p>"Do you love me?" he asked as he sucked harder and harder.</p> <p>"Yes, you know I do," I answered as I leaned down for a kiss.</p> <p>We kissed and licked each others tongues and I ran my hands over the front of his pants. He pulled back, "Not yet, let's get to the elevator," he stated as his hand reached for the zipper on my dress.</p> <p>"Let's get to my place," I agreed as I got on my hands and knees on the floor and waited for him.</p> <p>The elevator started to ascend and it seemed like every car on the elevator down that elevator had to be a sex story. We continued kissing as the elevator slowly rose. He finally pulled his hands from my dress and pulled me off of the elevator floor.
