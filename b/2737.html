I didn't mean to make him uncomfortable. I've never met a man like him before. It was my first time and I was scared.</p> <p>"I wouldn't call you scared, but I was just surprised you are the only one who enjoys the role playing side. Besides, if one of us does become the submissive side, they are going to do it to the other. Do you take that as a threat?" he asked.</p> <p>"I sure do," I said. "And why don't you call me Sam and the one who is in charge of the girls?"</p> <p>"I need a place, a good bed and a hard-on," he said.</p> <p>"Good, if you will just let me have a seat here then you can change back to your natural state." I didn't know why he wanted to do that, but there he was. He was looking at me like some stranger, but he was also interested in me. "I'll get some wine," I said.</p> <p>I went behind his chair, reached up and undid his belt and opened his pants. His dick sprang out of his pants and immediately hit him in the chest. It slapped on me where it had hit him. I dropped to my knees in front of him and began sucking.</p> <p>I love sucking a dick. It is the best part of a man, I've told many times. I like to make this man squirm and groan with need.</p> <p>I put his dick in my mouth and bobbed up and down sucking slowly and deliberately. I don't usually know what a hard dick feels like but I love to hear the moan I create in him. I love to play with his dick while I play with my tits, suck on his balls and lick my tongue on him. I can usually get it on and it is usually an orgasm, but when I get off he always comes.</p> <p>He really was in no hurry to cum, but he was just dying to fuck my mouth as soon as possible. I knew just what to do. I wrapped my lips around the head of his dick and sucked gently for a moment, making sure he was as hard as a rock and just ready to cum. Then I pulled off my lips and started to lick just his head, and then I slid it into my mouth and started to take it all in. There was so much of it that I almost gagged. God it was so much better than a pussy. I licked the part I had not gone down on before. If I had my dick in my mouth I probably would have cum right then and there.</p> <p>He got off on the fact that I was doing this and that I was able to do this to him. He loved when I did this. After I finished him off in my mouth, I sucked and licked all over his dick again, making sure he was as hard as when I made love to him in the kitchen. I sucked him slowly until I could feel him about to come.</p> <p>I stopped, looked him in the eyes and said, "Get naked!" He immediately started to undress. I put my arms around him and pulled him against me. We kissed for a moment.</p> <p>"Please, Sam, I want to see this." I reached down and took off his shirt. I kept my eyes on his face and watched him in the way that only comes to women. Finally he was naked.</p> <p>I pulled him to me and started sucking his cock again, giving him the entire first two minutes. When he had come the last few times, I crawled on top of him and took his dick in my hand. I slid it between my legs, letting his dick move slowly through my pussy. I looked at him, knowing that he could make this guy come at any moment.</p> <p>"I'm getting tired of waiting for you," I told him, "I need to take care of you, right now."</p> <p>He just looked up and smiled. "Is it going to fit?" he asked.</p> <p>"I told you he's just like a pussy," I told him. "Take all the fucking you want, right here. I want it all."</p> <p>I kissed him lightly on the neck and made him lay down on the sofa. He sat there and watched as I straddled him with my legs. I sat back on him and reached down and held his dick where it would penetrate me, then I slid it into my pussy.</p> <p>I wanted him so badly, but I didn't want to hurt him. I really wanted to play this part out, but the idea of it was starting to do little to prepare me.
