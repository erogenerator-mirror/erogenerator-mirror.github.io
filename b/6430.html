"Here's what I want to know: how much weight do you carry?"</p> <p>I was surprised by his question, but replied with a smile, "Just a little."</p> <p>"Then, let's see, how much is that," he said. He was getting a bit more serious and the smile on his face became more confident.</p> <p>"I don't know, Kyle," I said. "It's a little too much for me," I added, trying to avoid sounding unappreciative.</p> <p>"We don't have to make any promises," he said with a smile. "The way I have it, it can't really do anything to prove I'm wrong."</p> <p>"Oh," I said.</p> <p>"It's so big and heavy that it just has to be carried," he said. "If you carry it over the shoulder, you won't realize how heavy it really is, right?" I nodded to indicate the small towel I had used to cover my breasts, which had slipped on my lap as I sat.</p> <p>"So, that's how weight is carried around?" asked Jason, smiling. I nodded again. "Do you mean there is a towel hanging behind the sink because it is no big deal?" I smiled, nodding the negative.</p> <p>"No," I said. "Maybe some guys carry it over the sink every once in a while though!" He laughed at my surprise.</p> <p>"That's very true," he replied, "although, you know, it's no big deal to me either! Besides, I have a few other boyfriends on the side that I was serious about, but I never would carry 'em!"</p> <p>"That's an interesting story," I said. "Really, there might be one or two people in the neighborhood that carry it everyday."</p> <p>"I have to admit," he said, "that was a great story for me!"</p> <p>I laughed. "Well, let's be honest here and let that big old towel drop out of my lap."</p> <p>"I don't think so," he replied. "That towel is probably the heaviest and heaviest thing anyone would have carried in their life!"</p> <p>"I take it you're a breast guy," I said. He laughed, laughing. "So, can we talk about that," he asked. I nodded.</p> <p>"Okay," I said. "I have to agree that, to be honest, that's about as big as most guys would be able to carry. It kind of reminds me how heavy my boobies are because my nipples get very uncomfortable if I'm standing in front of those guys!"</p> <p>"They don't have to carry a large towel to walk into a bathroom," he said. "They're not so bulky that you wouldn't be uncomfortable, they just don't carry a lot of weight." I looked up to find Jason looking down at me.</p> <p>"Are you sure about that?" he asked. "It looks like they could use a bit more weight when they're standing up here," he said, nodding his head.</p> <p>"I'm no weight lifter," I replied. "Those two big fat hands would really show me if I stood still in front of them," I said. Jason's smile grew as I saw the way he looked at me, almost embarrassed at my comment. He had to stop looking away. He looked back at me as he realized I spoke aloud, looking away.</p> <p>"Come to think of it, that's not so much a big deal?" he asked. "I mean, I'm just saying that it isn't the most comfy place in the world to carry a big towel, and, I mean, it's been awhile since I've had a chance to experience it!"</p> <p>"Well, I didn't say we could do anything tonight," I said. "Just that, we can start in the morning!"</p> <p>"Sure," he responded, smiling. "But don't you have to work tomorrow?"</p> <p>"No, I had to run some errands before I leave!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"Oh," he said. "Well, okay. You've had work to do tomorrow, so if you need anything, I'm on my way." I put my head down and smiled. He turned his chair away from where I had sat.</p> <p>"I'm good," I said. "And, I'm not afraid to carry this big thing over the back of my truck!" He looked down at the towel a second before he looked back up at me.
