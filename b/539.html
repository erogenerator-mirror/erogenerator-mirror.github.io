"Oh! I'm gonna cum!"</p> <p>Her moans of pleasure, her body twisting with release, were enough to send a thick load of cum from him directly into her belly. Her whole body shuddered as she came, her voice vibrating as her body shook.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!"</p> <p>As she calmed down, she reached down to untie his hands. Holding his hands tightly in hers, she reached down to gently remove his shirt and pants.</p> <p>"Oh my god!"</p> <p>"Don't tease me," he whispered through gritted teeth and kissed his way down her face, kissing her eyelids and ears, her neck and her chest.</p> <p>"Just hold me," she whispered, looking up at him. He did just that, his hand slipping between her legs from behind, his fingers stroking the length of her pussy, the feel of her wetness causing him to groan and tremble a bit.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for this too-!" he moaned.</p> <p>"Just hold me," she whispered, turning on her side and laying her cheek on his hip, feeling his cock nestled between their bodies as he rolled over. Their skin felt hot against each other and he was able to turn his head back to hers.</p> <p>"I don't know what to think! How was it for you?"</p> <p>"I don't know! I'm so exhausted!" She turned into the warmth of his embrace, her fingers running through his hair. Her body wriggled against him, her heart pounding like crazy.</p> <p>"Me too! I should get some rest. Maybe we can do this again sometime."</p> <p>"Or with you..."</p> <p>"Yours?" his voice was a snort, his eyes watching her face the entire time.</p> <p>"Of course!" she laughed.</p> <p>"Okay, I get it!" They cuddled, kissing each other fiercely and drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>A knock gently woke her from her dreams of the day: they were now in the middle of a large bed. She turned her head to look at him as she got up, seeing the large mirror hanging from the ceiling. He was already naked, his cock standing at attention and she giggled, looking at herself in astonishment. She had never seen a cock as large before, seeing his cock was no surprise, compared to his was his thickness, long yet skinny and thick. He was thick, thicker than a sword but not nearly as long. "You have something that would keep a woman happy, don't you?" he said, his voice a bit husky.</p> <p>She nodded, her eyes fixed on his as he picked some clothes from the dresser and walked over to her. She took them off her body, loving the way he shimmied into them, knowing she shouldn't be looking at his cock.</p> <p>"Goodbye, darling," he whispered.</p> <p>She stepped closer to him and kissed his neck.</p> <p>"Remember, please don't hurt me," she whispered.</p> <p>"There's no need for that," she whispered back. She stepped back to look at herself in the mirror. He was looking back over his shoulder and watching her, a dark smile on his face. She turned back to get dressed.</p> <p>"Don't just go," he said, moving toward her.</p> <p>She didn't have to hear the words. She turned and caught him in his arms, her legs wrapping around his waist and pulling him to her. He didn't say anything, just looked at her with a smile on his face.</p> <p>"Why did you bring me back here?" she groaned between kisses to his neck. "You're not just here for me, are you? Is that why you asked me to leave?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he whispered, wrapping his hand around the back of her neck and kissing her softly on the mouth. "As much as I didn't want to leave you here, and now, you will," he explained.</p> <p>A shiver went through her like an electric shock. "I'll always leave you, I can't live with this!" she cried as she hugged him tighter, crying, knowing she shouldn't. "I'll never leave you, you're not enough, I'm so sorry!" She was sobbing into his shoulder, her body shaking as he began to grow hard in her hands, his cock thickening, straining and throbbing.</p> <p>It was one thing to have her in his arms in the middle, to be with a man in a bed, but with such a wonderful man in her arms?
