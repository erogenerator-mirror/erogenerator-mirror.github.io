I smiled.</p> <p>"If we are going to sleep together or anything, we need to get a quick shower first. I can use my key in the bathroom and we can go to bed at the same time." Tom agreed and as he opened the bedroom door I turned to face him.</p> <p>"I hope you're not too offended by the thought of seeing me nude at home, or even naked in a tub."</p> <p>"No, I'm not offended. I'm not too concerned with the fact you are the same size. In fact, I really don't mind. What's your point?" he replied. He had taken a step towards me when I reached out to take him by the hand. I had only ever met him after a certain college party. We were always drunk and horny and I knew he was one. We had done more than that. It was an opportunity; but not an obligation. It was an extension to our relationship.</p> <p>I was surprised how easily I let his hand reach my arm and squeeze it. I wanted him to touch me again, especially in a warm tub, at his own home. I looked into his eyes as he rubbed my arm. "I'm not offended, you know, that's how I feel," he said.</p> <p>"Do you want to see me nude again?" The conversation took a back swing that both of us enjoyed.</p> <p>"Not really...I mean, yes. I do now," I said. "I wouldn't want to take something I'm not allowed to. But would you do that for me?" His stare was as impassive as his hands as he answered.</p> <p>Tom wanted to see more of his sister. He was a handsome man with a lean figure and was the reason my father died when I was younger and was in a funk. He was everything that I wanted in a man of my caliber, including one who I loved, who was caring and attentive to me and wanted to satisfy my emotional needs. I couldn't bring myself to say yes, but that might have been too soon.</p> <p>Tom was now feeling a thrill of arousal inside his shorts. "Why didn't you mention it in the bath?"</p> <p>I thought fast. "Did I? I thought...what about your mom?"</p> <p>"Yes, I have to have a look at the pictures of Dad. Would you mind if I was there first?" His expression was still impassive as he answered.</p> <p>My own face lit up. "Of course, Tom. What do you have in mind? I'm sure Mom wouldn't think my father was here either." I was sure that I could do with a picture right now, not think about anything else. So I pulled him into my arms. I felt his hand running up and down my back and back. It sent a shiver through my body.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm about to take you to bed and in the tub. There is a shower in the bath. We'd prefer one there first."</p> <p>My face was still flush with embarrassment. There was a certain thrill and warmth about sharing our naked bodies in a tub. I felt Tom's hand running up and down my back. Slowly, he moved a finger to stroke my pussy through the robe.</p> <p>"I'm having a shower with Dad, remember," he said suddenly. "I'd better go ahead and get going."</p> <p>"Don't you think it would be inappropriate for you to go into his room with me?" I said suddenly, feeling even more embarrassed at the thought of being naked in front of my father and knowing that he wanted me to take his picture.</p> <p>Tom leaned forward and kissed my lips. "If he wants to take some pictures of me in bed, that's okay because I got them from mom's room earlier."</p> <p>"Mom and I already know that."</p> <p>"I think he'll be excited by me," I responded. I felt like it had been the last chance to tell him or show him that I was interested, but the possibility that he might take some pictures of me was even greater than the chance that it would never actually be taken. There was still so much at stake.</p> <p>Tom picked up a towel, folded it up on the dresser and opened another suitcase. He pulled out a pair of jeans and slipped them on. I turned back to him and asked if he would mind if I came in without a shirt on. I was not in the mood for a little of the same. It was important to be nude during a romantic visit and it was best to not be too daring.</p> <p>"Sure," he replied, taking me in his arms again. I felt his cock press into my stomach and knew that I smelled of a woman again. I couldn't look at him so I just closed my eyes and letâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
