When she didn't stir, I leaned closer, my tongue tracing the tip of her lips.</p> <p>"Hmmmmm." Her hand found its way to the back of my neck. I closed my eyes and took her hand. I could feel her fingers stroking the hair along my cheek. I felt my heart leap. She was so beautiful even the color of her skin was like the softest caress. With her free hand, she unzipped my jeans, slipping her fingers into the waist and sliding them down. I could feel her breath on my ear, just barely brushing my earlobe. She slipped them down to my sneakers, then lifted my foot from them and placed the other in front of me. I felt her kiss my ankle, then move up my leg. I could feel her licking my skin, the softness of her tongue making me shiver.</p> <p>"Mmmhmmm." She slid her tongue slowly up my inner thigh, leaving a small wet spot on my jeans where she teased me. I could feel her breathing lightly on my leg, her hand slowly stroking me. The sensation was so erotic – my breathing was quickening, and my legs were shaking. I didn't want this to end. "Mmmmm. Please."</p> <p>But she was silent.</p> <p>Taking a step forward, I took her hand, led her back the hall, her body covered in goose bumps. We ran into her room, and she closed the door behind me. We were kissing, her mouth soft and warm. She pushed me down on her bed. Without a word, she pulled off all your clothes, revealing your body. My cock was beginning to throb, almost painful. I was on the very edge of losing control. Our mouths were locked on each other – tongues wrestling against tongues, hands stroking, hands massaging. I couldn't be this close to her, she could walk through the halls, we'd be out of sight – my heart would stop.</p> <p>Our moans were getting louder, our urgency getting wilder. She felt me swelling in her hand as she stroked me. I was leaking down my leg – it felt like liquid satin, just aching for release. It was an amazing sensation to feel your finger, your mouth, working on me. It was pure pleasure. Her fingers worked in and out of me, feeling me go crazy between her fingers, feeling like her fingers on my cock. I couldn't take anymore. I exploded all over her.</p> <p>She stood and took me in her mouth. Her tongue danced against my cock, tasting me. I came so hard I thought I was going to pass out. She sat back and licked my cock clean, then smiled again, kissed the tip. She then looked up at me again, her eyes serious as ever. "Come here, baby." She took my hand and lead me back to her bed.</p> <p>She lay me down on the bed, then turned to the side and lay next to me.</p> <p>"What are you going to do for us?" She looked me. Her face was flushed – she had the sweetest glow, the most beautiful smile.</p> <p>"What am I going to do?" I wondered if she did it on purpose, in order to see me. But I didn't know what to do.</p> <p>"Lie right here..." She began to lightly stroke my cock. "No, really - tell me what you want from me." She said it sweetly, almost childishly. I didn't even have to be told a thing. I needed to fuck her right there and then.</p> <p>Without a word, I lay back and opened my legs wider. She slid on the bed on her side, and sat on me. "I knew you were a guy. I guess I knew how to control you. So I came up with this idea. I think it might do the trick a little." She began to slowly slide up and down the length of my cock – she knew I would have trouble staying hard. She leaned down to suck my lips, leaving a wet trail as she moved up the length with each stroke. She stopped then sat back, just leaving the tip of my shaft in her mouth.</p> <p>"No, that's not nice." I looked at her. She didn't look back. She was still playing with me, but now she was straddling me, her pussy resting on my thigh. I could feel her breasts against my chest.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." I tried to make all this sexy, teasing, but I didn't realize I'd had the entire thing.</p> <p>Her hand reached under to stroke my cock, making my head start to grow. She smiled again, and brought her lips to mine. I couldn't move.
