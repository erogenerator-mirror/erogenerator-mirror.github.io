I'll have a drink with all our friends and you'll have a drink when you join us. You'll also have a drink with the rest of us."</p> <p>He pulled his chair close to mine and said:</p> <p>"This will be fun while I'm away. Come on with me to my room."</p> <p>"Don't be silly, he's going out for the evening. I'll just have a drink with my good friend. It will be a nice night and I'd like to see him up close. What do you say if you feel quite brave and confident?"</p> <p>"Yeah I think I'd do you with a belt."</p> <p>In the meantime her mother told Jim with smile:</p> <p>"Go ahead! She's your teacher, and she'll be very nice if you feel brave. I'd love it."</p> <p>I looked her up and down and said:</p> <p>"You're beautiful mom!"</p> <p>"You're a very handsome man, and a very kind man too. You're sure the wine is going to be good to you."</p> <p>"Thank you. I'm really happy now," and we both laugh! We were both laughing a bit, and so was her.</p> <p>"OK if you won't mind," she answered. I saw her take a couple of pillows from the back of her chair, and throw them under my shoulders. Then she put a towel under her chin, and put her arms over me. I was feeling quite warm, when she kissed me full on the mouth again, and took my lips with hers. I opened my mouth in response. I opened hers and felt some hot juice inside, and it was still very warm. I could also see her smiling, with some of my semen still on her lips, and some of my semen on her breasts; we kissed again more intensely, and more passionately than before. Then she was naked and on me; both of us were naked too.</p> <p>I was lying on her on the sofa; there was an armrest so I was between her legs. Her eyes were still closed, as she rested her head on my shoulder, and she took my hand and we both started kissing again and again. But she was no longer kissing me. She opened her eyes and saw that both of us had turned towards each others' face, as we were still kissing. She broke our kiss and closed her eyes. She said:</p> <p>"This will be nice. I really am comfortable now. Maybe we should go to my room, and I'll stay naked."</p> <p>"You're beautiful mom!" and we laughed.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and said:</p> <p>"I would just lie on the sofa with you if you want to."</p> <p>"Sure, as soon as we get back to our table I have a nice wine. Come on and we'll have a nice long sip."</p> <p>I took her hand and started to pull her on to the sofa. I said:</p> <p>"I think you're so beautiful that you should be naked all the time too."</p> <p>She gave a short laugh and said:</p> <p>"I can't take off my clothes!"</p> <p>After a little of kissing and hugging, she said:</p> <p>"Now we can relax more."</p> <p>"I'm a man!" I answered, not really knowing how to reply.</p> <p>"Just say it. If you say it, then I'll know that you understand. Otherwise go on. If you're still a little shy with me that's fine. But please don't get too excited as soon as we go out."</p> <p>"OK. I'll take my clothes off in the next minute. I might go back to my room or to work."</p> <p>"Good!" she said." Now you go to bed before we start the wine."</p> <p>"What do we say?" I asked.</p> <p>"Come on, let's go."</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>As we went to bed, she got up from bed and got a new sheet and sheet to sleep on, and I got another, just like her, and she put it on. We hugged each other after we went to bed, and she said:</p> <p>"I liked your eyes, and I love your kisses. Your eyes are really lovely."</p> <p>I just kissed her a second, then asked:</p> <p>"You like my lips too?"</p> <p>"Yes! You're such a nice man, and you're a very kind man too. You'll sleep like a baby."</p> <p>"Thank you. It's your birthday honey."</p> <p>"No it's not, but it'll come later."</p> <p>After a few seconds I said:</p> <p>"I think I'd better put on underwear. I want to go to my room and have a look at you."</p> <p>She laughed as she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
