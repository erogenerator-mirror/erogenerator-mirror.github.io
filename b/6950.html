However, I do need to get to the doctor, and you're to help me, if that's okay with you."</p> <p>"Of course, sweetie, I'll be here for a bit," replied her mother, "I've been in a whole mess myself. I've made it known to my doctor, because I've started feeling sick again. I guess that makes you feel a little lower and lower in the sack."</p> <p>"Oh, my god, what are you talking about? I wasn't even feeling sick," said the young woman. She blushed, and she didn't know why, but it felt good. Her mother had not changed about her.</p> <p>"I'm not kidding. It doesn't always feel this different, and you can be just as much of a pain when we do it."</p> <p>As Elizabeth gently took the girl into her arms as she fell asleep, her mother's face came to mind. He remembered what she had said about it just last night, and she had indeed said something that caused a few of her patients to start to feel the same way. She had even said that she would look back at the same times, as she had never felt anything so intense.</p> <p>The next morning, her mother was feeling extremely rested, and she went down to the office after a light breakfast to change into her uniform, for she was feeling better as a result. She sat beside of her mother and gently held her hand.</p> <p>"I remember you talking with me about a guy with long hair, and how you used to say that girls just wanted to get away from their mothers, because it turned her on really bad." She put her hand on her mother's belly under the table. "Did you like that, mom? That's the one thing you got right, by the way, that I don't know about. But, what do you think, maybe I'll just start thinking about her, too?"</p> <p>"Well, if it gets you horny, you can put lotion on yourself after awhile. In other words, just get all that hair removed from around your body until you feel real, real good. If it gets you hot, just let me know, and I'll see what I can do to help it."</p> <p>"Oh mother, I just about die. Thanks. Thanks so much." The older woman's voice turned into what she hoped would be the voice of her daughter when she woke up the next day.</p> <p>"Elizabeth, you need to try to get that thing out of your system, and use some of the relaxation exercises you did for last night. I'll be back in a little bit. We can talk later, maybe, but not right now, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay. I'm gonna be going, too. Bye." She put her hand on her mother's abdomen and gently started to work the excess off. After her daughter came out of the room, she went to her side of the bed, and took her hand. "Here, I know it's not so easy for you to get that away from him, it just goes down, and that's what you'd expect to get if you put a little lotion on it." She took her mother's fingers and gently started working the excess away.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I should have done that, mother. Not the first time we've had one another, and it's always been with you watching."</p> <p>"You're right about the first time," she replied, "just a couple of times now. I really should just let it go." she smiled, and she couldn't help noticing that she could feel another little wave of happiness as she mentioned her daughter. She didn't really understand how that could possibly have happened, as she wasn't really a sex person. Still, it made her feel better about herself and her past.</p> <p>Elizabeth slowly made her way out of the room, and she was glad her mother had gone because this was not something she wished to do. She felt a little better as she walked, heading home.</p> <p>She could not believe how much she wanted to let go now, about what her daughter had just done. How much her relationship with her mother had changed in that few hours. It was only because of her own feelings, but what made her feel so good, so right now, was her own daughter. She knew that now, with the way things had been, she would be feeling better. She knew that was good as there was no longer anything more important to do and it was something to think about.</p> <p>Her first stop in a while was an exercise class, where she would help the other girls work out in the gym in order to have a chance to get rid of a hangover. She could hardly wait for the end of the week, as she couldn't get the feeling coming backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
