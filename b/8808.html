I'm not one of those people who enjoy showing off."</p> <p>"You are a beautiful person, but I think you need to let me tell you a little about yourself."</p> <p>As it turned out, when the three of us were together for a lot of the time, we often shared things together, so we enjoyed some really personal moments. It was like we all got along perfectly. When there was just a lot of people around to share things with, it felt good to share and I had the benefit of being at least partly dressed.</p> <p>"What do you mean you should have shared? I've always had a thing for your wife when she was naked. Is it something that you always wanted to do?" I asked</p> <p>"Well, I didn't think so. Our sex life is great and there is so much of it! Just talking about it makes me hard and I don't know where the other stuff that you told me was coming from. I'm not so sure if I really want to know. I just don't know if I'm asking you for advice."</p> <p>"That's true. Yours is my first, but not mine."</p> <p>"Well, it turns me on to know that you are hard thinking about me when I'm not wearing something that makes it hard for you. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that you need to take care of yourself if you ever want to have a girlfriend."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess that would be a little strange. I have never really been attracted to women and I never thought about them any other way. I like to think that I'm not a lesbian, I liked a lot of guys before and still don't."</p> <p>"It's okay, just like you like me or me. What does the one thing that I like better?"</p> <p>"Well, when we were talking and I found out that you and Sharon enjoyed being naked in front of each other, it started to really bother me. I didn't know what to do," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, you said that you always like me to be naked in front of you. Do you think that I'd want to do it again?"</p> <p>"That's nice to know. I never have done it the other way and I'd never do that if you didn't want to, but I like seeing it happen." I felt I'd let her down and was really starting to like her a lot.</p> <p>"You know I never really enjoyed it. I liked doing the same thing as you, but it wasn't as exciting as doing it in front of you and I didn't want to do anything that might embarrass you both."</p> <p>"I've never done it that way, but I'd never really been very shy about doing it without you knowing. I was never shy. I think that we both enjoy doing it and that it enhances the excitement that we get. You can tell that I like having you and I'm sure that you enjoy the same thing because it seems to be what we both need."</p> <p>"I was surprised at what it was doing to me. That was really new to me too. I think that if I'd tried it before, I would have done it."</p> <p>"That's okay, but it seems to me that if you'd just let it take you a little longer and maybe you'd like doing it again."</p> <p>I thought back to what we were talking about, about the sexual things we did together before and was surprised at how much more exciting those things were actually.</p> <p>"I think that there is a lot to learn about being a nudist. It was a lot like when I was a kid and my mom and aunt had a nudist cabin in their yard. It really feels strange at first, but that doesn't mean that it's not exciting. And if you really like being naked in front of someone and letting them look, just let them look and I can really feel the excitement. It's really nice to be exposed and I think that it would be a big turn on. I've seen a lot of naked women and enjoyed giving them something they really wanted to do." "Well, you can always just turn the lights off," she said. "There is really no difference now between us having this special feeling from giving you a gift and it's really great to feel you relax and enjoy it.</p> <p>We both enjoyed the day's activities and the sun was starting to set on its way down in a couple of hours. It was the most fun and erotic nude sun walk of my life. I never tired of feeling free and relaxed like that. She didn't seem that comfortable lying on her back and I could tell that she was very nervous about the idea of us doing something different.</p> <p>But then we were there and as she layed there looking up at the stars, I realized thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
