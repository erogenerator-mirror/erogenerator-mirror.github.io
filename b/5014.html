She's cute! You should have been with her some, you know." I said, laughing. "I can smell a woman in heat from here." And with that I walked off, and got inside of my car and drove over where our apartment was.</p> <p>Once inside, I sat down on the couch to watch some television while she did the same. I had been horny all evening just being with her, but it was late when I went upstairs to bed. I needed a good night's sleep.</p> <p>And the next morning, I woke up in the middle of the night in my bed, still with the same dream. I was alone in my bed, with the TV, and this time my hand was in the middle of the mattress, and I'm sure it was my other hand that was on top. I found it so erotic, in fact, that I found myself masturbating right there in the bed.</p> <p>And then the dream I'm sure of, came to earth. I didn't remember where I was, but it was in my head, and I'd been in my bed. There was a voice, and it could have belonged to someone else. Maybe it was the same one I'd heard when I turned the key in the bedroom one morning. The voice, I'm sure of it, would have made a good story line. I remembered her voice, and the way she'd said it! I had to have been dreaming as well!</p> <p>I was masturbating to the voices that had sounded while I was in bed and watching them. And, on a deeper level than just dreaming myself, I felt that it was my hand doing it. But where it was doing it, was who it was, too. I could be the real person who had woken up in my bed the very night before, and the voice was who I'd heard it. And I couldn't be anyone who'd heard it!</p> <p>And then I could feel it, right in my belly. It was my hand on top of my bed in my own bedroom. I could feel it on my bed, on top of my own! And there was nothing in my body at all that could describe how I felt. I was naked, in my own bed, with this stranger, and my hand on top of my own bed.</p> <p>And I was enjoying it. I'd felt it in my imagination at least once, and that was when she and I had begun. It was the same voice - the stranger, and the fact she must be a woman. Who was she? Had I heard anyone having their fantasies about this woman? Of course I thought she was. And that she was wearing a nightgown! My god, she was a woman!</p> <p>After a while of me pretending that I was a man, and letting her hear my fantasy, I knew I should have let her believe it. But she and I were both so sexually charged I was feeling it! I just kept thinking, "This is why I came to you for the dream, because this is the woman who loved you so much, and I want you to enjoy yourself as much as you do me."</p> <p>And in the middle of that fantasy, I remembered where I was and how the hands she was fondling me, had been in my own bed when my own hand was stroking my own cock. It had been hard, and it felt so good at that moment I would've sworn it was my own body that was jerking in the throes of pleasure!</p> <p>I could feel it, and my fantasy was my own.</p> <p>But after a while I could't bring myself to think about all that. That was strange. I was still dressed, but I could see that I was fully erect. There was some sort of wet spot on my underpants and around my balls. I know, I know, that I was looking at myself in the mirror, with my hand on top of the mirror! I looked. As I got to know this stranger, the fact that she was completely nude and in her own bed, with me and her. And why I had made myself cum thinking about this woman, and had her wish my own fantasies too!</p> <p>Maybe this would be my final fantasy. It could be, it would be, and it could be all that I want to do. Or, if I'm lucky, as I suspect it would be, I will never know until it was overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
