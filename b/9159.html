At her very first introduction, their faces remained close to their husbands' as Vell helped Delvin to remove his shirt and then his jeans. As soon as she was naked she stood up and crawled on all fours between them, lowering her mouth to the man's cock as he lay back and watched her and then lowered her pussy over it as Delvin took Vell's and sat down.</p> <p>They both watched as Delvin thrust into Vell's pussy and then Vell lifted her head to watch, her eyes fluttering as she felt her pussy being stuffed with the man's cock and then she began to moan and squeal with a mix of pleasure and pain as the black man fucked Vell while she knelt, waiting her turn to service his husband.</p> <p>"Fuck, you've got an amazing pussy," Delvin said after a moment.</p> <p>Vell was just nodding as he continued to thrust into Vell, his words adding up for effect as both girls were now moaning with their own sounds of pleasure around his cock.</p> <p>"Your turn, baby, fuck me."</p> <p>She dropped her mouth and reached out and grasped his cock again as she moved to her knees, spreading her ass for him and then sliding down, pushing her pussy down as he took her ass in his hands, pushing them together and then back up, making Vell cry out into his wife's pussy.</p> <p>Just when he felt himself getting close, Delvin started to slow as he realized he wasn't sure Vell would be able to handle Delvin's dick as thick as his. Instead, he thrust into her pussy, watching to see how he would feel, the woman of his life doing something she didn't enjoy doing, making herself enjoy it despite their marriage.</p> <p>Vell's response was to shift her hips back against him and then to push back against him, rubbing her pussy on Delvin's in-and-out thrusts.</p> <p>"You're fucking me, sweetheart," he said, watching as Delvin got up to stand and Vell to kneel as he took the man in his arms that now stood close by.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck, I'm so fucking close," she said as Delvin pulled her back to him and pushed his cock deep in her.</p> <p>"Yeah, baby. Fuck his dick," Vell said.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck yeah," Delvin said.</p> <p>"Hurt him?" she asked, sliding her mouth to his ear.</p> <p>"I don't think you want to think about that either," Delvin said, his face hard and close to hers.</p> <p>Vell had tears in her eyes as she realized what was going to happen. She didn't want that man to fuck her that night and she especially didn't want him to be the man to do it.</p> <p>"I don't," Vell said as she looked into his eyes and smiled.</p> <p>"I love you and I want to be your husband," she said as she watched him slide back to his wife, holding her tight, his hands caressing her waist.</p> <p>"So we're fucking," she said as she pressed her lips to his and kissed him softly.</p> <p>"Yeah. So we're fucking," Delvin said, his mouth finding Vell's again as their naked body heat pressed together, and then it was over and they were pulling apart as Vell's hips came to rest on Delvin's, both of them still looking at the other, their arms wrapped around each other, looking lost in each other's eyes.</p> <p>"I love you," Vell said as she kissed then said. "I love you, too, dad."</p> <p>"Love you, too, baby," said Delvin as he held her close to him, giving her long, slow kisses that she couldn't resist. "Good night, honey."</p> <p>Vell had turned in the chair to give Delvin a close look as she stood. She could see his face and it looked like everything but her eyes faded away. She had the strangest look and then she felt a small, strange sense of loss and love.</p> <p>As she stood there, she noticed Delvin wasn't in the same chair. He was kneeling at her feet and, though the view she got was of him in a bathing suit, she saw the woman standing nearby looking at them, smiling.</p> <p>'Oh fuck, what was that?
