I think back to the night I met this lovely woman. Her slim body, short brown hair and deep blue eyes. I've had some thoughts about her since that night, and can't resist the thought of what it would have been like to be with her. She's not as bad of a woman as my wife, but she definitely has a sex drive that is just as wild and varied as I do. Yes, I am a virgin, as far as I'll ever be. This was definitely the night that I was hoping for.</p> <p>But as I'm about to tell you a whole new story, that story is not told in a story about a guy who I've never met, nor have I had the experience I have right now. As I sat there sipping my wine and sipping my vodka, I knew that I would be seeing those beautiful women again very soon.</p> <p>In my thoughts was the moment I felt the desire begin to build inside me. As I sat drinking my soda and sipping my vodka, as I lay down I continued staring into the other person sitting across the room from me. For the next forty-five minutes I looked each woman from their face to her toes, as I watched their eyes travel up and down.</p> <p>I have to admit that as my tongue began to move across my lips, I was getting very turned on. This woman was sitting beside me, her legs crossed, her dress pulled up around her waist. I could tell that she was getting very excited by the movement of her breasts. They were small too, and very perky as they lay back flat across her body. In fact, they stood firm and proud along her chest. It looked as if she were trying to keep the material covering from rubbing against her nipples, and it was quite hard to do that in there.</p> <p>As I continued to sit there sipping my drink and sipping my vodka, I could feel a tingle begin to build inside of me. My pussy was starting to juice up and I could feel it begin to drip down between my thighs. I reached over and placed my hand on her knee, just below her dress, and began to stroke my middle finger up and down along the soft flesh of her inner thigh. I noticed that my nipples were hard and protruding through the front of my shirt as I continued to stroke her knee with my fingertip.</p> <p>Her skin was warm and smooth against my hand as my hand moved up from her knee to her thigh and up to the back of her leg up to her stocking as she did the same. I could feel the heat that emanated from her, I could feel the muscles of her thighs beginning to tighten and I could feel a moistness form there as my fingers began to move faster and faster on her skin.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it was happening, I felt a heat rising inside my belly as my breath increased, and I could sense my pussy getting even wetter, and a throbbing in my clit was beginning to grow. I could feel my head begin to spin a little as the desire grew and consumed her.</p> <p>I looked up from her legs towards the front of the room where two men were sitting talking to each other. They were smiling at each other and a tall black man was moving towards them, their eyes meeting briefly for a brief moment, then closing, with an unmistakable air of something I couldn't quite place. But I could feel as my imagination grew and grew, feeling the lust growing and growing in my stomach as the tension grew between my legs.</p> <p>I sat at the end of the couch and began to rub my thigh as I thought about my husband. I began to think of the night I made love to my wife and what her husband would do. I didn't know how much farther I could go, I had to get her out of my mind for good.</p> <p>As I continued to watch the two men, one of them looking at her and my husband, as they talked, my heart began to race. I wanted to make love to her. I wanted to hear her cry. So I began to play with myself.</p> <p>But I could still hear her husband talking to them. I could see him staring at her legs in their hose, his hands moving up to her thigh and then back down. I watched the pair of them begin to get into each other, as they laughed and talked. They were touching each other and talking a lot. I could feel the heat growing between my legs as the idea of watching them get it on with my husband was becoming an obsession.</p> <p>Suddenly the man with the big dark brown eyes came to the other end of the couch to talk. I watched as the black man lifted a big black leather belt off his shoulder and brought it quickly towards my husband.
