"It was a miracle," she murmured. "I had my own dreams and dreams and dreams, and they all were good. You didn't have to sleep," she said.</p> <p>"I didn't have any dreams," I countered. That wasn't true. Even as a teenager, I knew where dreams came from. "It was too late to start anything. I just went to bed," I added.</p> <p>She shook her head negatively. "But you came to watch and you came to bed with... me instead."</p> <p>My throat was very dry and dry. "I was too young," I replied.</p> <p>She looked at me through half-closed eyes for a moment after realizing that I was looking at her. "And you're so beautiful," she said as she began to lean into me and rub herself against me. I was too worn out to resist. I kissed her forehead and then her cheek and kissed her nose as I pressed myself fully against her.</p> <p>"You never told me where I was going to sleep," I offered.</p> <p>"I guess I was dreaming," she replied.</p> <p>"I was dreaming that maybe you had a boyfriend," I told her.</p> <p>"Oh, really?" she replied.</p> <p>I had a slight smile on my face. "Maybe," I replied.</p> <p>She didn't reply as she continued to grind her pelvis against me with an awkward rhythmical motion. "It sure as hell sounded like a dream," she remarked.</p> <p>"I suppose it was," I answered.</p> <p>We continued to rub against one another and occasionally kiss, as we continued to look at each other. I tried one of her breasts and it bounced slightly as we rubbed. "And you're definitely beautiful," I finally told her.</p> <p>She looked at me like I was a child again and laughed. "Aww, you're so sweet," she said.</p> <p>I felt myself becoming aroused again as she said this. I moved my hand down to the hem of her dress and slowly worked it up her thigh until I reached her panties. I gently grasped the waistband and pulled it down, revealing her pussy.</p> <p>"You do know that this isn't the first time I've had dreams about you." She smiled and nodded as she continued to stroke my head in her small hands.</p> <p>I couldn't help touching myself as I looked at her. She was so beautiful. Her nipples stuck out hard and straining against whatever she was wearing. Her pussy glistened with a wetness in the moonlight of the room. My cock was almost fully erect as I worked her panties down her legs, finally exposing the pink lips that were hiding her pussy. She had no hair on her pussy and the small patch of hair was like a tiny little landing strip.</p> <p>She slid her fingers between her legs and spread herself for me. "You don't mind if I shave it off, do you?" she asked.</p> <p>"No," I answered as I slowly lowered myself between her legs. She spread them as wide as she could as I stared into her pussy. I could smell her musk, and I could see her little nub, which protruded from her pinkish lips.</p> <p>"It's still a little tender," she told me. I was feeling very tender and unsure of myself in more serious matters that I seemed to have gotten myself into.</p> <p>"No," I replied as I moved lower on the bed, looking at her. "It's just that it was pretty..." I began to apologize, but she put a finger to my lips stopping me. "It's okay," she assured me. She had no intention of asking for an explanation from me. She knew that I wasn't her friend, and that's what she wanted.</p> <p>I slid myself into her and I was shocked at how much bigger than my penis my cousin had become. I felt her legs wrap around me as I slid into her. "It's okay," she insisted, which was true as her legs were no longer wrapping around me. I could tell she was enjoying it by the tightness of her wetness. I moved deep inside of her, taking care not to move too fast. We stayed connected in that position for a moment while we looked into one another's eyes.</p> <p>"It feels really good to be inside of a girl," she told me as she stroked my bare back. "It is something I've wanted to do with you for a long time." She let her legs fall back to the foot of the bed as I began to thrust in and out of her with more and more urgency, making her moan slightly with little pleasure.
