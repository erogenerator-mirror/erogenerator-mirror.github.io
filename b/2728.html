He turned to speak to me, but I turned and was gone. I was about to leave him when he turned around and asked, "Where . . .?"</p> <p>That wasn't a good way to say "I thought you might want to talk".</p> <p>I didn't give a damn that he knew that I wanted to talk to him about me. I started walking, not looking for an end in the matter, and found it difficult to follow his directions. The house that I was living in was not far from where I lived. Mr. P. had told me not to use the garage, but I had come in the other direction to get something to drink. When I went up to the second level down to the garage door, I found a young male figure waiting by the garage side door. As he turned on the car he asked, "Do you want to give me a lift?"</p> <p>"Come on," I said.</p> <p>When he turned around to say, "Can I at least see your face? When it comes to your car I don't mind at all getting out of the car if you've got a good memory."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>I turned out of the garage and into the back yard.</p> <p>"Let's talk more in the grass next," he said.</p> <p>I followed him into the house, and he asked if I was hungry.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm hungry."</p> <p>"Good, I'm starved. Would all of this help?" He asked, holding up the car for me to drive.</p> <p>"Thank you, that was very kind of you."</p> <p>"I think we might have a deal," he said pulling me out of the dark and into his arms. It was warm enough, there was no mistaking that he and I were naked and on the floor of his car as we kissed. He carried me into the house, over to the sofa as I lay in his arms. His hand went to my crotch and as he rubbed my wet pussy, I couldn't help but reach down between us and run my fingers through his hair as we kissed.</p> <p>Before I knew what was happening, he was unfastening my jeans and dropping them and shorts to the floor. I lifted my hips to him, not wanting the action being so obvious, instead letting it happen. As I felt him press my pussy lips apart, he asked, "Is this what you want, don't you want to come?" I shook my head no.</p> <p>He moved closer and pulled me around on his lap and pressed his hard cock against my belly, pressing my hard clit against it. I let him rub me there, the combination of the rubbing, the feeling of his hard-on, and the smell of his male testosterone made me crazy. Then he held me closer and lowered his mouth to mine. My eyes fluttered as we kissed, the first real and first contact. My body was burning with desire.</p> <p>His hands were on my ass, caressing and pulling it and as I moaned into the kiss, his hand went down further and slid along the side of my leg. I raised his leg to allow him access. He slid along my slit and I felt his fingers slip past my lips. I was soaking.</p> <p>His mouth moved back up to mine and we kissed, deeply, passionately. He felt the wetness of my tongue as it entered his mouth and we kissed again. This time, his hands went under my shirt to my bare breasts and I felt him cup each one. He raised his head from mine and looked into my eyes as his hands found their way inside my bra to my breasts and I lifted a little and let him feel the nipples hardened by his touch. His hands began to move up and down the outside of my body and I put my hands on his shoulders as he lifted me.</p> <p>He raised me a little higher and then raised my feet to his shoulders and his fingers moved my panties back. He lifted me up and pressed me so I was on his lap, again his hard cock pressing against me and I could feel the head of his cock pressing against my tummy as he bent me back toward him, his body resting on mine. I felt his hands on my breasts as he squeezed them, caressed them, rolled the nipples. I felt myself go red.</p> <p>I arched up to match my body as he raised my legs to his hips and began to move his cock along the cleft between them. His hands began to move across my stomach and soon the whole length of his shaft was inside me. He raised me up and down on him again and his hands were on my ass. His thrusts were moving me and now I was moving with himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
