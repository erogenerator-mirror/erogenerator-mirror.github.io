I was just about to go take off for home when everyone started asking about him - he just smiled at me and just said hello."</p> <p>"Yeah, he was happy to see me and so was I."</p> <p>"It's not what you want to hear, but I'm not saying you should have to do that - but at that moment you are the one giving into the impulse. You have a friend waiting for you and now it's your turn to help him. You will get as much out of it as you want, I'm going to have a quick question or two to ask you and I want you to understand. It's about a year and a half from now - if anything happens to him it's my fault that we don't have a relationship."</p> <p>"I agree, but let me tell you what I did for a change." I smiled at him and started to get into bed when he stopped me.</p> <p>"Wait. Now you don't want me to be like that, do you?"</p> <p>I smiled again. "No. I just think you should go ahead with that when you get there. And it is really good for you to have someone to talk to about it. If you see that you would like to take it for yourself if you could just take the time and look into his eyes - and maybe have a few words with him or maybe you can just say goodbye and give it another shot - I know he would be happy to hear from you, even if it means a lifetime commitment."</p> <p>"I'll get to the point if you get up and come with me."</p> <p>"No, we have had a long day and I probably don't want to walk around here to my room or anything like that because it's not my first time here but I'm not ready to do it."</p> <p>I looked at him. He had the same look that I had given to him when we first started chatting and I wondered if my expression had changed. That look made it seem as if we were really friends and it was all very new to me. I think I saw a smile at the corner of his mouth and when I looked back at him the smile was still there but different. I don't think he had that look on his face when he kissed me. I didn't know what to think.</p> <p>"I think maybe I should just go to bed and dream about you, John. Don't worry, we'll have another chance in the next few days and hopefully we can just do that."</p> <p>"What's the matter with you? Are you suddenly mad at me now for asking you to come with me to my room or do you think there will be another chance soon?"</p> <p>"Now it's your turn to smile. I was just going to go to bed with you and see what happened with you and maybe we could just say goodbye on Monday."</p> <p>We sat watching the sunset in the distance and he said, "I don't think there will be another chance for us. You are just the nicest guy. I'm just really happy just to have someone to talk to about this stuff."</p> <p>"You're sweet. I hope you're all right on the walk up to the hotel. I think I will talk to some of the other hotels we might know about. I'm not sure what you'll think of me."</p> <p>"I'll think what you think of me. Thanks for talking to me and I hope to see something of you as you're getting older."</p> <p>"I hope so. I just hope we can have similar conversations when we start dating this time. I'll try to keep you guys together until I get the chance."</p> <p>"You know, I'm just happy for you and you're a nice guy. I hope I can see you again next year."</p> <p>"Me too, and I promise to see you again. I can't imagine how it will feel to talk again with a guy who has been around since he came here."</p> <p>I sat thinking about this until I remembered I probably only had a few hours to go to bed. Maybe he was right. I couldn't imagine spending that time with him. If so I might find the whole thing awkward but if not I might find it to be more of the same. I looked at him again and asked, "What makes you so sure I can come around to that?"</p> <p>"Well, I think you already know a lot about me by now and have already given me the chance to do that for you."</p> <p>"Okay," I said.</p> <p>So there we were and I was sitting in a hotel room wondering if he would be as good or as quick to forgive me. That's something that I could never do by myself and I didn't even have the guts to tryâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
