It was clear what she meant, the smile and twinkling blue eyes.</p> <p>"I suppose I need to work on that now?" I asked, taking the coffee pot from her hand but instead of replacing it on the coffee table I just turned and gave her a wink.</p> <p>"Yeah. Yeah, you need to do that. You'll be surprised how easy it is."</p> <p>I chuckled at her but as I did she turned to go and sat down. I watched her go with a look on my face, knowing what I was looking at, which was a woman I couldn't wait to do.</p> <p>It was only a short time later when we met in the hallway. She got into her car, I followed right back up the aisle where she dropped off her bags, and followed her to the front door. As with all doors she opened the door, and I climbed out as she reached for the handle. I followed her up the stairs in the darkened hallway, and up the next one.</p> <p>She opened her door. There were no windows to the outside and she got out a blanket from the closet. She sat down, and I followed behind her. She reached into the inside pocket of her coat and pulled out a large envelope and handed that to me. "Here's what I wanted to do. I don't have a credit card, it's too much. I just want my own keys."</p> <p>As she said those words I realized that it was probably only a matter of time.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>In the bedroom the bed was almost bare. We had slept in the same bed many nights over the last few months, and now there were only the light from the nightlight on the dresser. A large blanket on the same bed with a note from me saying that I couldn't come in. She opened the door and I sat on the edge of the bed where I pulled the blanket over the tops of my thighs, and she snuggled up next to me.</p> <p>I don't recall falling asleep right away, but the events that seemed so real when I opened my eyes did not come to my mind. In fact I could feel my cock growing even harder inside my pants and I was embarrassed of my condition. Her head on my lap, her arm across my waist.</p> <p>She broke the silence "I'm sorry I made you do that, I thought it was something you wanted to do. I didn't want you to think I was some one you didn't know."</p> <p>I didn't reply, and I felt that my hard on was now poking her leg under the blankets.</p> <p>"Don't go looking for it," she said softly and I turned over. I could see a little part of a smile on her lips as I could only imagine what her expression must have been like, but there was nothing I could do about it. I knew that there wouldn't be any reason to tell her.</p> <p>I don't know how long we sat there, but it seemed like she had a good time. It seemed like a short time but we kept talking about nothing except time in the hotel. After a while I looked at her, and asked, "Are you tired? Want to go to sleep?"</p> <p>She just smiled and said, "Yeah, sure. That was fun. If I had known something was going to happen I would have done that before. It just seemed so right and so wonderful. The way you looked at me and wanted to do that made me feel so safe. But then I got the feeling that there was a part of me that really wanted to go back to her."</p> <p>I didn't quite know what to say, "I know that. You know I could never think of doing anything like that, with anyone else I could have been hurt." I looked at her and saw the sadness in her eyes. "I know, and I don't blame you for being mad because it happened."</p> <p>She looked at me and held my hand and looked as if she was trying to comfort me. "And now I've told you everything. You can trust me. I don't think I'm going to live the rest of my life thinking I have gotten the best chance at happiness with you. I don't know what it is I'm going to tell my mother tomorrow. They might kill each other."</p> <p>I looked at her and held her hand then leaned in close to kiss it. We kissed and held each other for a long time.</p> <p>We didn't say a word. She wanted to be with me but she could feel that she didn't have the same feelings for me.</p> <p>After a while she looked up and said, "I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow."</p> <p>I pulled her down to me and held her as she left the room. When she went by one of the doors I tookâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
