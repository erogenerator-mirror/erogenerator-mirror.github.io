He pulled his head back just enough for she felt his warm breath, as he pressed his cock hard against her stomach.</p> <p>He took her nipple between his lips before sucking it harder into his mouth. He kissed and licked the other before once again taking her nipple. As his lips and tongue moved down to her stomach, she felt hot heat rush through her body, leaving her quivering with desire. She wanted to be touched and explored by him. She had wanted him to eat her until she almost fell from over-indulgence, while he had only kissed her feet and the last few minutes of her life.</p> <p>He continued his journey, and when he finally reached her hot, swollen pussy, he lowered his mouth down to her sex. He lifted his head and she felt his tongue slide deep between her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Oh, god, I want you inside me." she moaned into the darkness.</p> <p>He smiled against her clit, then lowered his face and began to kiss and lick her, making her taste like pure honey.</p> <p>"Yes, please." she groaned desperately.</p> <p>As he licked her, she moaned and writhed under his touch, until finally he slipped his tongue inside her pussy, licking wildly, making her squirm and moan louder.</p> <p>"Oh god," she said as he slipped his thick tongue inside her swollen pussy, licking furiously.</p> <p>When he began to fuck her with his tongue, she had never felt anything so good, feeling that she would come just from he knew.</p> <p>"Yes, please, please make me come," she groaned.</p> <p>He licked and sucked her and suddenly she screamed as an immense orgasm gripped her body. Her hands flew to his head and as she came, she felt him lick her all over, causing her to orgasm even harder.</p> <p>He rose from her and walked towards her, feeling his need rise again. She moved to him and they kissed once more, this time more passionate and deep.</p> <p>Finally he got to his feet and moved his head to her breasts, sucking on her nipple and then taking her nipple to his mouth again. Again he licked and sucked her and she had the need to scream "YES, YES, YES!" every time. Finally, he placed her legs over his shoulders and thrust his cock into her again very hard and fast. The feelings of his cock and her being the object of his lust were overpowering, as always.</p> <p>She was surprised how powerful and powerful the feeling of him inside her turned her on. He used her body in a way just like he had her from the moment he had first seen her in the dark. She would never experience or even think of being with another man until he had started. He wanted to know that he was hers. She understood the meaning of the word, and what pleasure she would be able to share, and that was all it took. She did not believe she would ever get to experience the heights of pleasure she had never felt. But she did love to be dominated by him.</p> <p>The feeling of passion and power over him, made her feel so powerful. And she came with as loud and long a moan as she had ever given, in her life.</p> <p>When he finished his work, he picked her up and carried her with him to the bed. He laid her down on her back as he kissed her face and neck. Then he slowly kissed his way up one thigh and kissed and licked his way up again, stopping to lick her breasts. He had been so good to her, just giving her such pleasure. He didn't ask her again. As his kisses moved upwards to that special spot on her neck, she had never wanted him to stop.</p> <p>Her breasts were exposed to his face and tongue, as it was the sweet taste of her skin, of her sex, and of her juices that lingered in her.
