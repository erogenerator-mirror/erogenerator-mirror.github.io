Some of the dance floor was bare, but most of the patrons of the place were in the middle of the dance floor getting the ball drop on them, including some older guys there. I guess I had put on a bit of too much clothing as my boobs were hanging out the front of the dress showing the top of them as they did when dancing. I was wearing low cut, low rise business cut dress and high heels.</p> <p>I was very, very wet, but I had to wait on one customer (her man) who was sitting down. It seemed to take ages and I was getting aroused as she got a hardon, sitting on the bar stool that was in front of me. I wanted some attention so I tried to go with the flow of things. I would move forward and wait until the man was looking, then I got up and walked out onto the dance floor. As I approached, I heard the man at the bar say to me that I was "damned good looking" to him and that the bar patrons would love me. I told him that the bar was "open" and he started his comment, "I thought you were sexy", as I smiled at him and he immediately told me he thought I "would be." I told him that I was a very sexy, sexy woman and that he was lucky to be single and he couldn't wait to find out. He reached his hand to me and said "I think "we have" just enough room in this place" to me to go on my own. I asked for a cab back towards the center of the bar. We walked out into the lighted area and he held the door open for me. He led me to the back and there was a booth for two. I took the chair in the far left of the couch and he sat down next to me. He told me to unbutton the dress while I took my shoes off. He told me to take off the dress and he lifted my dress off my shoulders to start playing with my tits. As the neckline of my dress slipped down my boobs, he played with my nipples between his fingers, lightly, then harder. "They are so sweet" he said. I said that I liked having my tits played with and he said, "I want to feel your tits, not just feel."</p> <p>As the neckline of the dress started sliding, he pushed it down until it was at my waist, then he held one of my feet in his hands and started playing with my other foot with his other hand. As he reached the bottom of my foot and played with them, he slowly slid my other foot down my shin. He gently slid the shoe of my foot up my leg until he felt it was all but on my thigh. He put my foot back down and slowly slid the other foot down my leg, his fingers lightly caressing and tickling the insides of my legs until his hands had completely covered me up. He leaned toward me and said, "You are very wet." I told him I was very wet and he reached to gently caress my pussy and asked me if I liked it when he had touched me. My reply was, "Oh yes! I do, I liked it and I loved seeing men touch you." He continued to play with my pussy for a couple of minutes as I said, "I would never do something like that!"</p> <p>He then asked if I liked it, and I nodded yes. He reached into his shirt pocket where he retrieved a small bottle of hand lotion. He started rubbing my legs and then my feet and then slowly slid his hand along my leg to my pussy. As he rubbed a little more lotion, he rubbed his cock a little harder on my foot, making it harder and I liked it. He was very close to my pussy and I could feel my juices begin to run down the crevice inside my legs. He rubbed a little more of the lotion on the top of my thigh, then pushed a finger inside of me and made some of the juice leak down between my legs. Then he stuck his finger up my pussy as far as he could and let some of the juice out. I love the feel of something in there and as I am wet, he could easily slide two or three of his fingers in me and pull up and over my clit. "Do you like playing with your nipples, baby?" he asked. I said it is my favorite feeling and it really gets me turned on". He said "It is for the people you can feel when you like, don't worry about that, I will only do that to you, okay?" I just nodded yes, that was so exciting to me - to be turned on, and to be touched.</p> <p>With that, he got up and started walking across the dance floor towards me, stopping just short of me to look at me.
