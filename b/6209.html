The Captain asked, standing over the two.</p> <p>"Let's go!" He called. Three men approached the two.</p> <p>The Captain reached out and grasped the two, shaking their hands. The Captain called for another one of the men to join the group and took their hands into his own, pressing them together as he walked toward the door.</p> <p>The Captain opened the door, a woman entered the room, followed by the three, and a woman, a woman dressed in red, stepped into the entryway of the suite.</p> <p>"Thank you so very much, all of you for accepting this invitation," He said as he closed the door.</p> <p>A woman came forward and hugged each of the men, then came back to meet the others. She shook hands with each of them briefly before stepping aside. "Welcome to our home," She said. "You will join us tonight, all of us, in the parlor at seven." She turned and walked to the staircase. "Come on, everyone," She called for everyone.</p> <p>"The meeting is at seven," The Captain said. "D'you like the place? It's very nice."</p> <p>I nodded my head in agreement.</p> <p>The meeting began at seven. The five men and the woman stood around discussing what had just been agreed to. After the meeting, the Captain had a cup of coffee.</p> <p>"D'you know, I really don't have much experience in that area of this relationship," He said.</p> <p>"I'm afraid your wife was a wonderful fuck, but after that, I don't think we'd be the same as in our relationship, Sir!"</p> <p>He took another sip of his coffee, then looked over at me. "You're right, we would be."</p> <p>The Captain turned to look at the three women. "My wife," The Captain said. "Was your...friend with you, too? I would like for her to be on my list of friends." The Captain looked at the woman, who nodded, then looked off into a corner.</p> <p>"A woman's husband was...more than a man, Sir."</p> <p>"Did you know what his name was?" Captain asked.</p> <p>The woman smiled. "Oh, he's my husband. They are very close." The Captain's face darkened. "I know, Sir." She raised her hand and waved it dismissively.</p> <p>"The woman we love, Sir," The Captain said, shaking his head at me.</p> <p>The Captain's face changed. She shook her head. Then, in a whisper, she said, "But, I won't let you know that, until after we celebrate!"</p> <p>I felt a little weird talking like that to a stranger. "This is your house," I said.</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir," She said, before turning to walk away.</p> <p>She stopped at the edge of the room and turned back. "I'm your wife." She leaned forward and kissed me on the lips, softly. Then she bent low, gave me another long lingering kiss, just a peck on the lips as she stepped away.</p> <p>"Good night, Sir," She said, looking over her shoulder to see who was leaving.</p> <p>"Good night, sweetheart," I heard the Captain say.</p> <p>She turned and quickly opened the door to her room. Two moments later, she was standing in the doorway. The woman had left and was closing the door behind her.</p> <p>"Good night, ladies," I said, then stood and embraced her before she could get away. I held her face close to mine. I kissed her lightly on the mouth, then she pulled me close and felt the hardness of my cock pressing against her. She gave me a kiss, then stepped back, leaving me with a pained expression on my face.</p> <p>"Have a good time, sir," She said as she turned and walked to the door.</p> <p>The Captain gave me a smile, then turned to walk out of the suite.</p> <p>"Don't forget to thank us for our hospitality this evening, Sir."</p> <p>"Thanks, Captain."</p> <p>The Captain closed the door and walked toward the bedroom in search of his clothes.</p> <p>"She's gone!" I said in relief.</p> <p>"Honey, are you alright?" The Captain asked. He had a perplexed look on his face.</p> <p>"I'm fine, Sir."</p> <p>"Well, the men have been taking care of business for the last half hour or so, but before dinner, or before we get to watch your date, I'm going to have a little dinner prepared."</p> <p>"She's not your date, Sir."</p> <p>"That's okay," He said, as he looked over the menu that lay on the bar in the entryâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
