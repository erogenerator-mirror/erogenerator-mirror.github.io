He smiled and introduced himself as he came in. We joined him at the table outside and he looked at me closely. His voice was very neutral.</p> <p>"Hi, I am Tony" He said, with a friendly smile, "I was wondering if you would help me with some business. I'll have the food delivered by noon tomorrow."</p> <p>"Yes, you heard right!" I said. We walked out to the car, got in, and Tony went to get his truck, then he joined me. The drive to the place was very pleasant.</p> <p>When we got to Tony's house we found that the house is in a pretty rough part of town which seemed to have lost a lot of business recently. The place is very small. However, I have noticed that since the property is gone, the owners have had very nice amenities.</p> <p>I was about to say goodbye when Tony looked at me and said, "It took more than six months to clear out everything. I've had so many questions, I really don't even know what to say." He paused and then said, "Don't I have any idea of what I'll be leaving in your body? Or, will you still want to carry your baby?"</p> <p>He looked at me closely, then he smiled and asked if what he was feeling was for me. We talked for quite awhile, him asking me all my questions. His face was a little different than Mike's. It showed lots of personality.</p> <p>When he finished, the three of us got up and we walked inside. Tony had already opened an in-ground heating pool and began to clean up. I was going to change into my swimming suit and swim. Tony said he would take care of that.</p> <p>We got out and returned to the room and had a glass of orange juice for each other. I went to the kitchen and pulled out a salad. I could not resist, I had thought about fucking Tony in a way, but I really did not have my libido in control.</p> <p>I brought out some lettuce, some greens, some potato and some corn on the cob. I also got some tomatoes from the vegetables in the bottom drawer.</p> <p>We ate our lunch in silence. When I brought up the tomatoes, he said that he had been thinking about our conversation a lot.</p> <p>"No it was not a conversation I would have with you. I had been thinking about it for ages, and as a result I had decided that I wanted to be with someone else." he said.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to be with another man, or would you feel more comfortable if you came with me to your friend's house?" I asked.</p> <p>His face blushed a bit but he said, "Of course not! I would never have ever gone with another man."</p> <p>He looked at me and said, "Don't be embarrassed", and then he looked at his plate, and said, "You won't need to hide your excitement. It is part of your being with another man or women."</p> <p>I could not believe my ears, that my boy friend was saying, that I was a woman and had no interest in a man. He was just a friend.</p> <p>"That wasn't so." I said. I think I just realized he meant to be honest.</p> <p>Tony said, "Do all men like women? Are they the same for each other? Can you feel it, can you feel it?"</p> <p>I just looked at him, "Have you ever been with another woman?"</p> <p>Tony laughed, "No" he said, "and there are many women out there who are the same."</p> <p>He was quiet for about a second, his face turned a little red, then he said, "Well I have never been with another woman. I only do it when I am with Mike because he will let me do that with him. You will be with Mike soon." He laughed, "Besides, it's not like anything he will do to you!"</p> <p>His face turned red, that just made me laugh more.</p> <p>"Don't be embarrassed Tony" I said, "I feel like I want to be with someone that is experienced and adventurous."</p> <p>We finished our meals and Tony turned to me with a questioning look, I was not sure if Tony was asking me for help or if he was just testing me. The second we finished our plates, I got up and went to the bathroom and then I took a shower. I soaped up my body all of the time and let the cold water touch me.</p> <p>I didn't have much success, the soap didn't help but I did feel better. Before I started to dress, I was surprised to see Tony looking at me a bit differently, not a lotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
