"That's the way it's done."</p> <p>This time he fucked me very hard.</p> <p>He was in perfect physical form, taking me through every detail and giving me no chance to protest. His cock pounded in and out of me, his heavy balls banged up against me each time he reached the deepest part of my tunnel. I could hardly breathe.</p> <p>He fucked me for two hours straight. Three hours I thought. Two whole days. Three entire days of total sexual deprivation.</p> <p>He didn't want me to suffer.</p> <p>We both knew it.</p> <p>At last, he pulled out and turned me around and pushed me down on my back. He knelt between my legs and lifted them wide.</p> <p>The thick dildo was pointed at my mouth. He reached down and grabbed a handful of my hair in one hand, his other hand still gripping and stroking my cock. He started sliding his fingers up and down my length. I could only close my mouth as he brought his hand up from me. He rubbed it gently around the head. He looked down at my cock as it jutted out before him, the veins bulging. He opened his mouth and slowly slid his head forward. It was smooth. Even at his height, I had a hard time getting it past the ridge. Once, I imagined it was a cock.</p> <p>Once.</p> <p>Two weeks earlier, when we had met at a restaurant where the staff greeted me with a smile. His face was priceless.</p> <p>But, I suppose, it was something that happened when we were talking while we were at the gym. He said something to me as we entered a corridor, and when we reached a door, he asked if I was interested in some kind of a deal.</p> <p>But, it was my first day at work. I didn't know what to think of such a contract. I could have been disappointed by him, he had made my life hell. But, what could I do? I'm sure he knew the deal.</p> <p>The man was going to drive down, I didn't care. I just needed to get away for an hour or so and get my work done. I was already at work when I got the lift down to the car park.</p> <p>The man pulled out without a word and went to his car. After a moment, he opened the door, took one of the keys out of his pocket, and swung at me. I tried to run, but I couldn't move a hundred yards. Before I knew what was happening, he had his hand on the back of my neck, and pushing my head towards his crotch.</p> <p>I couldn't control those feelings of desire and terror. I was so turned on. I didn't know if the man had a knife in his pants, but he used it. He pulled my head back and pushed me forward till my face was in his crotch. I felt his cock rub against the back of my neck and then slide across the collar of my shirt. He started stroking my neck and shoulders. I felt his skin against the back of my neck. I started to feel more and more turned on. Then he took off my shirt, and his hands slid down. By now my dick had grown to the point of no return. I tried to stop him, but I couldn't. I don't know what it was, but I couldn't help feeling that he owned me completely. His fingers stroked across my shoulders and down to my chest. He made his way around to the front of me. My hands were still handcuffed to the man's legs.</p> <p>He ran his hands up my chest and stomach, around my waist, and to the small of my back. He rubbed and cupped my breasts. I moaned and cried into his mouth.</p> <p>"My sweet, little slave," he said.</p> <p>I couldn't speak. I couldn't say "no" or "yes". He kissed me and I could feel his tongue slide into my mouth. I felt like a slut with my boss. My mind was filled with lust. He started to kiss down my body.</p> <p>I wanted nothing more. I wanted to feel his lips against me and feel him on top of me. I thought of the man in the mirror, watching me, stroking his cock. I wanted to look down at his mouth on me, feel the heat and the wetness that had accumulated in my body. His head dipped to my chin. His lips came in contact with mine. He kissed me softly, lovingly. He took the side of my mouth with his other hand, and made his way to my neck. His lips trailed their way down to my chest. He pushed his way between my breasts, and started to suck my nipples. I could feel electric currents running through meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
