She was the epitome of feminine beauty, and she was very, very hot. His heart began to race as his fingers began to trace a fingernail around the outer edge of her hip, where his fingertips had been.</p> <p>He suddenly became aware of his own heartbeat, and his face felt like it was going to burst. His whole body was flushed, his cock felt like it was going to burst. He turned to meet her eyes, a slow smile on his lips.</p> <p>"Are you going to be a good girl tonight, baby?" she asked huskily. "I want to see you suffer."</p> <p>Dylan was not about to disappoint her. She had asked for it, and had been very convincing. He nodded, feeling himself swell in his pants.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he thought. "I will get it right." He reached down into his coat pocket and took out an envelope, revealing the top one. He handed it to her, and she took it, smiling.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, still holding the envelope in one hand. Dylan closed the envelope and held it on his lap. "What's it for?" He asked, hoping the answers would be worth it.</p> <p>"A kiss," was all she said, and Dylan's heart sank a little. She handed him the envelope again, and set it in his lap. Dylan couldn't fathom the idea of going from the boy friend to a woman, and yet here he was, sitting in his car in front of her at the park of her choice.</p> <p>"Thank you," he whispered to her. "But do not ever call me that again, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," she agreed, and kissed him.</p> <p>Dylan's heart was still pounding, but it subsided quickly when a car door closed. Dylan fidgeted a bit at his sides as they left. There was only one way for him to take his mind off the prospect of getting a kiss. He quickly gathered his keys and keys, and stepped outside, to find Ms. Jones waiting for him.</p> <p>"Come in the car," Ms. Thompson said. Dylan was surprised to see him here, and not by Ms. Jones' offer. He got in the car, but Ms. Jones told him to walk as part of their deal. He followed closely, walking through the trees and parking lot, until he came to what was obviously her house. Dylan was pleased to see that her home was completely gone, and it looked to be a single room. There was a single king size bed at the center of the room, and a nice stereo and stereo combo on the wall.</p> <p>"Oh no, Dylan," Ms. Jones smiled when he made it out of the car. "Stay there and watch over here for one minute."</p> <p>After she locked up and locked him in the house, Ms. Jones went to the stereo. Dylan stood in the entry hall, watching as she put on some music, and he could hear the song "Come to Me" by a group of women called "Gangla." Dylan wondered if she was really singing along with it. She had a very good voice, and he thought she would make a great sounding lead singer. The next song was "All Right Baby," and he thought he could probably get lost in the lyrics by just saying anything out of hand.</p> <p>Lunch was the usual, but Dylan and Ms. Jones decided to have a beer beforehand. Dylan took a seat next to Ms. Jones on the couch as Ms. Jones had a couple of the same ones from one of the men they were sitting with. Dylan was very anxious to get to what was likely to be an intense session with Ms. Jones, but he was going to do his best to keep up with her. He was not a good at socializing, but somehow his friends seemed to be all over him when they asked him to help them out with the house.</p> <p>He thought to himself about the girl who had been sitting next to him, as he listened to the music she was putting on. "She looked so lovely," he thought to himself. "I could give her a ride to her house."</p> <p>"I've got to help carry a car in." he added softly. He could feel himself getting aroused, and his heart raced as he pictured what it would be like to actually touch her. "Are you having any trouble with your car?" he asked.</p> <p>"A bit," she mumbled. "My tires are really loose so it doesn't really matter."</p> <p>"I know it will be alright, Ms. Jonesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
