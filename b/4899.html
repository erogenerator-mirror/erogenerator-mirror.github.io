He lifted her easily, then lowered her to the stage in front of his table, facing the crowd. She took three steps forward as he pulled her across his lap, forcing her to straddle his lap. I watched, and when I saw my wife's face, I knew that she had an extreme expression on her face. I knew exactly why – I would have to work on her again if you let me. "Why you?" I asked her. "There is no love in pain," she said. "I was only hurt because it has to be done again so soon."</p> <p>He lifted her again, this time without his hands. This time my wife was now straddling him on his lap, facing the other end. She was kneeling and facing the rest of the audience, facing the audience. She knew that when she sat down that the spotlight's glare would be on her, and would only illuminate her sex. She also knew her arousal was visible on her face.</p> <p>In the same instant, I watched the screen, and saw my wife's face reflected in it.</p> <p>The other audience member turned to face his chair, which he held in his left hand, but had not moved his head. As soon as she reached out her left hand, he extended his right up, toward her, and her hand met the pole in his hand. His right hand grasped her buttocks, then his hand moved behind toward the front of her body and pulled her crotch to his own, where it started rubbing the front of her body.</p> <p>They sat there, kissing and rubbing their bodies against each other. I knew that they were getting both their asses rubbed and their pussies rubbed against each other. At first they didn't realize it, but by the end, they were both moaning, and I could tell that the lights were being adjusted to the right or left by the sounds and sights of all the performers. The men, a few feet away, were staring at the screen, and the girls were just watching them.</p> <p>As the crowd was getting up, the MC said to the crowd: "Thank you very much for this show. You may go now" He rose to his feet, and pulled out the remote control. It was still there when he held it up to the audience.</p> <p>"There will be four more shows on this set," he said. "They could do the two hundred shows and we could do twenty five shows, but the two hundred would cover my fee and my time. Would you like a demonstration?"</p> <p>The men agreed.</p> <p>"And they could do it in the nude," I said. "I think I could get them to agree before they pay their money. I don't think the other seven would give us much to work with."</p> <p>The MC asked them to leave, and they departed, all except one who was standing before him. He took the remote control from the audience as his camera flashed over him and pointed at him. He looked through his camera lens for some time, then pointed at the stage above him. It was the only audience to look at him, and they stared at it a bit nervously as they stood there looking at the stage, waiting for the signal of the MC.</p> <p>The MC began to walk up to Mark and the cameras that had been covering him, and began undressing him. First, he took off his jacket and sweater, then unbuttoned his shirt and unclasped it. Then he pulled his undershirt off over his head, and reached back, unbuttoning it, then removing it to toss it onto that chair. He unbuckled his pants' zipper and, to my surprise, the zipper moved down, pulled it down, and then slid right down. He was standing in front of the audience on stage naked, his cock pointing out in front of him. He reached inside his underpants, pulled out his cock, then, to my surprise took his right hand and spread it out, then took his own hand and took it down, then moved his hand back, over his cock, and down onto it.</p> <p>He put his right hand back on top of his balls, and slowly let his right hand fall downward, until his right hand met the side of his pelvis. He slowly moved both of his fingers down his shaft and back up, and then he pulled and pulled his fingers across the sides of his cock, down the shaft, then back to his left hand, up the inside his left hand where it met the left forearm of his arm. Again, he brought his left hand down again, then back down his shaft—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
