I wasn't going to stop at the salad, I was going to get something a bit better. I had to go get some food and a couple of beers. I picked up my empty bottle and headed back up to the room. My mind was starting to get a little fuzzy. I felt very, very empty.</p> <p>I looked at the clock; it read seven o'clock. After getting my stomach rumbling, I went to my room to get ready for breakfast. I pulled on a tank top and a pair of shorts. I grabbed a bagel, a bowl of cereal, a cup of coffee and my phone. I had a bagel sitting next to it. I sat on the bed eating my bagel. I had a few aspirin in my hand and a little sleep. I was still feeling the effects of the coffee.</p> <p>I thought about my morning with my husband and the situation we had created in the hotel room at the end of the week. I loved our sex life and that was my way of making sure that he kept getting hard when we did it. I also liked his ability to take his time. There were all kinds of things that I enjoyed doing with him. I liked to see how it was different each time we made love. I liked to watch him on his knees sucking and fondling my cock. I had learned a few things along the way. I knew how to tease or pleasure him just a little. I used his mouth and tongue better as much as he did, so that when we got to anal sex, he knew what I really like.</p> <p>After about an hour and half of eating and the pot of coffee; I was ready to go, with a bit of apprehension. I got up to get some water. When I came back down to the front of the bedroom where my clothes were scattered about, I stripped down to my swim trunks. I tossed the trunks onto the chair beside the bed, threw the top on to dry and jumped into the shower.</p> <p>When I got out of the shower, I put on my swim trunks, my tank top and my shoes. I wrapped my towel around me to protect myself from my own body heat. I sat on the toilet and picked up the paper bag. I was about to call some help when I saw that my phone was back at my dresser again. I had left it on the dresser and then picked up a piece of paper that I had picked out. I unfolded it and looked at it. I had the number out. It was a written note. I read back, "Sleeping sounds great and I'm going to have a nice sleep. Love to talk." I smiled as I wrote the note back and flipped the phone open to read what it said.</p> <p>"Waking up this morning feeling empty and with a strange man sitting next to me with his clothes on and a note out of the bag. How weird is that."</p> <p>I laughed. "Maybe it is more than weird." I got up and went to bed to sleep.</p> <p>The Endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
