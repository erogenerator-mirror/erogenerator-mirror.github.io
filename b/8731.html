He was curious to know more. She was quiet for a long time until she began to say "I'm so glad you didn't ask for my virginity... It might make me a lot more adventurous... I want to try everything with you at once... I want to know when it's time to go on my own and see where we're at."</p> <p>He was surprised by her honesty and asked, "And what happened after that? You never told me anything happened."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "We still live in a house near our campus. I have a key to the front door, so you can unlock it if need be, and then you can come into the house as a surprise."</p> <p>At that moment, it was my turn again. I was almost paralyzed with a hardon, knowing that I could make her do anything.</p> <p>I asked her, "That's a lot of fun for a beginner." I kissed her again and asked her to go to the kitchen and get lunch.</p> <p>She came back with my sandwich and we ate in silence. We finished lunch and ate and talked a lot. She asked me about my job that summer, how I was going to graduate and what a great grad student I was.</p> <p>We finished lunch and I told her, "I still need to get my homework done." She said, "Yeah and I'm in the process of getting a master's this semester." She told me, "I wish I would have been a little harder to teach."</p> <p>I smiled to myself. "I guess I'm the hard man for the time being." I said.</p> <p>She said, "You know I do my best too."</p> <p>"What do you mean? I'm your friend." I replied.</p> <p>"You're so nice... I really feel like we can spend a lot of time together" She said.</p> <p>"Would you like to do that sometime?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if I can get that much of a break from college." She said.</p> <p>I looked at her and said, "Well if I had to guess just one way or the other, I don't think I'd say yes. I would say that's fine."</p> <p>"Well I'm glad we could do something sometime." She said.</p> <p>All day Monday through Friday we were together, but now I think that's it is about to end. What's wrong with that? I guess I could do with a change of topics and maybe I could use some good old-fashioned pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
