"I'm not the one who doesn't think, but what's her motivation? I can't tell you with a straight face...." He grinned. "Anyway, this is a really good time, so I'm leaving it up to you, so don't keep me waiting. Don't worry, I won't make you go around in circles about it, you'll find some fun in it first."</p> <p>"You sure about this," she said, "it's been so long since I've been out with a single man, well, I hope I'm not going to be an absent-minded old lady on the way home from the hotel, because she's never looked better."</p> <p>"As you can feel," he told her, "you are already."</p> <p>-</p> <p>Dakota lay on her bed in the dark, looking at the ceiling, as he finished his lunch. She had left a note when she got home and asked him to come over. She had to admit, she was happy for him.</p> <p>Sitting at the head of the bed was her phone. She didn't actually hear it, but she knew it was him because he called and told her he was sick and wanted to come home. She thought back to the way her parents dealt with her when she was younger, and how much of a burden they'd had. Now she was twenty-one, and she didn't even know the number of people that she had to call and talk, that were her mother's friends. She picked up her iPhone, and dialed. She didn't really recognize either of their numbers, and she knew one of them would be on the other end. She heard Sam's voice, though, so she knew he was on the other end, though she couldn't identify the person.</p> <p>He didn't speak, and it seemed like he was going through his business papers for the day. "No... I'm not that fast," he said, "and I'll let you know when I'm done. I'd even let you talk to me without worrying."</p> <p>"No," she said, "I'm not... okay. I'm good."</p> <p>"And you're not scared anymore?"</p> <p>"Yeah... Yeah. I suppose I am. Really... But I don't think I'm ready to go back on our life right now... I kind of miss how I used to look."</p> <p>"You're not ready to be with someone you have the heart to break a relationship with?" he asked and then asked, "and just how is that supposed to go for you? Because that's just... normal."</p> <p>She was in the middle of dialing his number again, and she didn't need to do this. Her last words were, "I don't love you."</p> <p>"I don't. Listen, I love you, too, and I would never break a beautiful woman like you. It's just that..." she hesitated, "...I'm not ready to do that with you, you know?"</p> <p>"No, I don't. This isn't about us doing it with someone else, it was only about you. I really think you're special, and that is all you should need."</p> <p>-</p> <p>Sam waited impatiently for the call to end, and he was surprised at the speed of the calls since she called. He hadn't heard from her in years, so it appeared like a lot had happened. She had gotten lost in a big city and had left him after a week of getting nothing, so he waited patiently for it to die down before he even responded.</p> <p>"Sam?" she said finally, and he knew she must have heard from someone else.</p> <p>"I'll be there in ten minutes," he said, then hung up the phone. He could hear his stomach growling as his life was falling apart, and he wasn't sure how much more he could take.</p> <p>He got up and poured himself a cup of coffee, then went down the hall to the study to find his wife. "Dakota, where you at?" she called and he pulled a face while he poured himself a cup of coffee for himself and his wife. There was his wife, sitting behind her desk, with her head on her knees reading a book. She looked up and he saw her frowning for a moment before her eyes turned to him and she started to speak.</p> <p>"Are you going to be okay," she asked.</p> <p>"Dakota, I'm in the back, and I'd rather be home. It is a bad place to get to spend time. I'll be gone for the next three weeks, I promise."</p> <p>She got up and pulled off her jacket and then put it in the drawer of theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
