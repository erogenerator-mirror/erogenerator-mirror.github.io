The pain was almost unbearable but the stimulation of the other end of his cock in my throbbing hole was enough. I had no idea it could be so much pleasure.</p> <p>After several minutes, he pulled out and shot a load all the way up my ass then rammed his cock in again.</p> <p>He rammed it in deeply again and I could feel it as he did this over and over. We didn't talk that he had done this before and we didn't say anything. We just did it. It's been forever since we did this. If I had any idea, I'd be saying stuff like, "Stop," and we'd have just fucked again right there on the couch.</p> <p>But I didn't say anything just kept going. Sometimes it felt as if I was being fucked, sometimes that was more like a hand job, but often all I could say was, "Please may I have my orgasm?" and "Yes I want you to finish me off."</p> <p>His words were more like little begging words. They were words I knew but never got.</p> <p>With each stroke he told me how good it felt and how good it felt when he did it. He'd stop just before I had my orgasm started to build up and he'd tell me that was it. The little words were like words that were begging him to make me cum.</p> <p>One of the things I don't do is masturbate but he was never able to have me do that. Maybe it was because he never said that he would make me cum. He made me feel so special and so good I could hardly concentrate during our session.</p> <p>After the session was over he came back to the couch, got some of the towels and cleaned up while watching television.</p> <p>He returned to the couch and sat down across from me.</p> <p>He asked me if I was okay and I just said, "I think maybe I should get out of the house tomorrow." He smiled and nodded.</p> <p>I thought he was kidding about having an orgasm but he nodded and said he wasn't upset with his cock in my ass. My head was swimming with thoughts all of which only went through my mind as I sat there with this incredible experience. My body was now craving release and I was determined to have it. I knew if I didn't get aroused then I'd need to cum for him and in turn he'd want to have it.</p> <p>After his orgasm, he asked me what I would like to do this next time I really wasn't sure so I told him I hoped that my ass was a good thing to look at. He leaned back looking at the ceiling then asked me what I was doing all day. He got all embarrassed about asking and I told him I wasn't sure I really wanted to see his cum.</p> <p>With that we both burst out laughing and he asked me if it was alright. I'm sure I blushed but he just told me that he loved me and that he loved looking at me. I think he kind of made up his mind and his face relaxed then he looked over at me and said, "My god I wish you could see me like this. You look so beautiful and my cock is so hard right now." As he said this I couldn't help but admire his sexy manhood. It was all ready growing back. It must've been the idea of seeing and being watched that really turned him on.</p> <p>We just sat there laughing and talking. He asked me what I'd like to do in my ass. I told him I wanted to try it but couldn't say for sure. He kind of put his hand on my leg and moved it up until he reached my thigh.</p> <p>It felt so natural to let his hand touch me and I was so horny I couldn't tell if he did it on purpose. But that's another story. So what did I tell him so I could leave it at that. It would have made me blush if I had known it was actually going to happen.</p> <p>We talked about his cock for several minutes and after he asked if I really wanted to try it I nodded and he leaned over and kissed me. It was an amazing feeling. After the kiss I asked him if he was a virgin. He said yes but I asked if he was excited about getting his first experience.
