That seemed to do the trick and I was all smiles.</p> <p>"Why thank you?" I said. "That's all I was thinking about before. But now? Well? I am still going to fuck you, baby."</p> <p>There was a pause and then she added "But when I am out, okay?"</p> <p>"Oh, honey. We'll do it on Friday?"</p> <p>"I promise, baby. We will. And we'll do it now," she said. "But before we do it, have me change my panties!"</p> <p>I was very surprised with that. Of course I wasn't expecting a reaction from my gorgeous lover. She just looked at me and I was surprised.</p> <p>"And what's the difference? That's what I wanted to say."</p> <p>"It's just that, like you said earlier, no panties."</p> <p>"But just so you'll have to wear them, honey?" she asked as she lifted one of her legs to give me access to her crotch.</p> <p>"I don't know if I'm supposed to like it or not."</p> <p>"Don't worry. I still have a little surprise for you. I've wanted you to wear something like that for so long, that's why I shaved up my pussy just for you!"</p> <p>"And that's what we're doing when I get home, honey. I think it's time we had a baby with it, right?"</p> <p>"And what if we both get pregnant?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't know. Maybe we can find out."</p> <p>And with that she gave me a wicked smile and lifted her leg to place it on top of mine. Then she started to ride my cock, slowly.</p> <p>"It will be okay! I promise," she said as she stopped with just the tip of my dick inside her. Then she began again.</p> <p>"I will, you know I will. Do you know how beautiful you are?" she asked, then leaned down and kissed me.</p> <p>"I can't wait to suck your great big cock until you blow your load," she said with no hint that I had the slightest idea about what she had in store for me.</p> <p>"Oh, I am already going to blow it!" I moaned. "Do you want to blow it?" she said. "Do you want me to swallow it?"</p> <p>"Please, please, honey."</p> <p>"Good answer," she purred with a devilish look in her eye. "You want me to swallow it?"</p> <p>"Y-yes," I said, a little too quickly, "I do,".</p> <p>"Good answer?" she said, her eyebrow raised as she looked at me with a sultry look in her eyes.</p> <p>"Y-yes."</p> <p>"Okay," she said as she started to get off me, and slid it back inside her.</p> <p>She began a slow fucking motion, and kept looking up at me the whole time. There was an urgency in these words and their meaning that made me so hot that I thought we were going to burst. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.</p> <p>"Are you two still in there?" the voice said.</p> <p>"Yeah, you could call the police if you like," I answered.</p> <p>"But baby!" she said with a big grin. "Where the hell are you two going?"</p> <p>And as she got off me, she walked over to the door and opened it. Two guys in their mid to late twenties and looking as hot as ever, stood there.</p> <p>"Hey, girls!" The guy said. Then they turned to their guy friend.</p> <p>"Hi, this is Mike and Amy Owens."</p> <p>"Please forgive the intrusion," Mike said with a crooked smile. "But can we get some privacy so we can talk?"</p> <p>"Okay," the two guys said.</p> <p>Mike stood up with a couple of beers, and Mike walked into the other room. Then Amy walked back over with the two guys. Mike turned to Amy and smiled widely. It was an incredible look, Mike. His smile was so big it was like he was wearing nothing but a smile and a few tears. It was obvious he wanted to do whatever the guys wanted. What the hell? Should I be surprised; should I tell him? But here I was with this huge crush on a guy I've known for years and he was smiling at me like he wanted it.</p> <p>"Can we talk?" Mike said, looking directly into Amy's eyes. "Please."</p> <p>Amy and Mike sat down on the loveseat on either side of me.</p> <p>"We have only known each other for about 20 minutes," Mike said.
