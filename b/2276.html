As they went along, she began wondering how to go about it. She felt like she should ask a question, but couldn't really form a coherent sentence.</p> <p>"I don't know how to get the boat back to the islands," she thought. "I'm not going to take any bait."</p> <p>As she was lost in thought, she got the boat back on the moor and stopped at the first of the small stores, hoping to find a couple or more.</p> <p>"That wasn't too bad," she said, looking around. "The weather is still hot so we might get a bit warm before we go back."</p> <p>"Yeah, I think I'll get some cold water," he said, getting out of the boat. "That's a good idea. I'll be here before long."</p> <p>He grabbed his keys and walked towards the back.</p> <p>"Don't forget the phone," she told him.</p> <p>"Yeah, sure."</p> <p>She could hear the dial tone as he got in the boat. He dialed on her the third ring, but as it was just a second before the call was over, she started to get excited.</p> <p>"That was fast," she thought with her eyes to see if he didn't get his heart rate at least up to normal or the phone was on speaker.</p> <p>As he walked back towards the house, she got out of the boat and made her way to the front door.</p> <p>"There is a knock," she thought as she opened the door just a crack. Her heart rate started to accelerate again, but she knew better than to push anything.</p> <p>She ran back to her room and locked the house behind her as she reached her door. The door opened and he was standing there in a suit.</p> <p>"Oh my god," she thought. "I'm glad you're here."</p> <p>As she walked in past him, she gave him a big hug and told him she would be back in a little while.</p> <p>He was already walking away from the door as he turned to look at her. He was about 6'2" or so, with short dark blond hair, and piercing blue eyes. He had a full head of thick blond hair on his head, and he stood about 6'3". He was about 190 pounds. He had very muscular arms, and quite a bit of hair between his shoulders.</p> <p>She had the sudden urge to wrap her arms around him and pull him to her. She felt her lips start to press against the side of his and her body start to get warm and moist. His lips were so soft and warm, it sent shivers up and down her spine. She had never really been attracted to guys sexually before, and she thought she knew how much she would love to do so. She had always thought men were just fine.</p> <p>As her body started to warm from the heat in her mind, her hand moved to start touching his shoulder. She felt his arm move up. It slid over her hand and she started to rub up and down his biceps. Her hand was still on his arm. She started to slide her hand down again.</p> <p>As they were walking past each other, his cock started to slowly harden at her touch. She felt it start to throb just a bit.</p> <p>She felt her hand slide from his shoulder to his hip, where she pulled his ass as she continued to rub that spot that felt oh so good.</p> <p>"So, I'm still not sure about that big ole thing of yours," she thought to herself.</p> <p>She let her hand drop to the inside of his thigh and started to slowly rub. Her eyes never moved from his crotch. His hand was still on the outside of her elbow, but his cock was now pointing up towards her. It was now fully hard, and she would just have to take the tip back and hold onto his shaft with her one hand.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry" she said as she reached her other hand around to take his cock in her hand as well.</p> <p>"No, don't be. It's ok," he replied, pushing his crotch closer to hers under the water.</p> <p>She continued to slide her fingers over his shaft, but it wasn't long before two things happened in a very quickly:</p> <p>First, he let his head drop out of the water, and was now pressed against the back of her legs, as her hands started to move up and down his arms.</p> <p>Then she felt his cock start to swell up in her hands as she started to move her fingers up and down his shaft. As it did so, he pushed into her hands, causing his cock to slide up slightly. Her mouth started to go dry, and she felt her throat start to open, which was causing her hipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
