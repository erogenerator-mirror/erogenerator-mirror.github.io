"I just thought you wanted to be with a girl."</p> <p>"No. I just meant that you need a little variety. I just think you need someone more feminine than she. I can't say that I'm a dominant guy."</p> <p>"I'm still a man."</p> <p>"Good," I replied. "We'll see." She sat up and straddled my lap, straddling me. "Is this too forward?" she asked. "No, not at all, you're really cute."</p> <p>I smiled at her and kissed her gently. As I did I ran my hand up her back, then down to cup her ass and then between her legs. When I felt her wetness I cupped her pussy and inserted two fingers. Alicia moaned at my touch and started grinding her hips into me.</p> <p>As my fingers became faster and deeper Alicia started to bounce against me, taking more of me inside of her. I knew she'd cum soon if she kept it up. She was bucking against my hand and her breasts shook as she rode me. My fingers worked her pussy lips as my thumb found her clit, then pushed past it and rubbed over her little nub. With my other hand I reached between her legs to massage her clit harder. This drove her over the edge.</p> <p>Alicia moaned and clamped down on my fingers, her thighs clamped down on my hand. My thumb had found her clit and she rode my hand, pushing it further inside. Her ass was rocking wildly at my knee. I used my thumb to rub her ass and felt her muscles contracting tightly on my fingers. A few seconds later her body shivered again, one of her hands gripping the bed as another orgasm washed over her.</p> <p>"Wow!" Alicia exclaimed, then let go of my hand. She slid down off my lap. "I needed that," she said as she pushed me back slightly and sat beside me. She took my hand and placed it on her breast. I took it and squeezed her nipple hard. "We can't do this!" she said with a pouted grin. "This will be more fun then you could imagine." She leaned over and gave me a quick kiss, then sat up and straddled me again. "I'm ready," she said. "Just sit still."</p> <p>I settled back in the chair as I watched her move up and down on my shaft, her head falling back and her long red hair dancing off her shoulders. "Mmmm that's nice," she sighed as she worked me. "You're even bigger then..."</p> <p>Then she sat straight up while she rubbed her pussy over my cock again, then laid her body down on my chest. "I'm ready."</p> <p>I smiled and took her breasts in my hands, gently squeezing them as she rubbed herself against me. I pulled my lips from hers to kiss her. "It's going to be a long ride," I said.</p> <p>"It will. Besides which has been almost a week."</p> <p>"But it's been a week." I teased her with my finger, then pushed her back on the bed, leaving myself between her legs. I pressed my cock head against her opening, then pulled back until it was just inside her and I pushed in slowly. "Mmmm, that's nice," Alicia moaned above me. "Slowly, just tease me a little."</p> <p>I slowly and gently pulled back and reentered her. "Mmmm," her eyes got wide. "It feels so nice," she moaned again. I picked up the tempo and started to pump her deeper, my balls slapping against her ass. The tempo increased as each stroke brought us closer to a mutual orgasm. Alicia put her arms around my shoulders as I picked up the pace and was pounding into her harder. "I want to cum with you," she hissed, then bit my shoulder as her eyes rolled back as she lost it. "Oh no!" she cried. "You don't get to cum until I say so," she gasped as her pussy clamped down on me and she rode me with more fury.</p> <p>Alicia was panting and moaning. "Oh," she moaned, then kissed my shoulder and neck. "I was dreaming of that all week!"</p> <p>I was close myself. "You've got me so horny. I really need to cum. If you'll just wait and see, I won't last long."</p> <p>She looked at me with her eyebrows raised and the way her hair swished wildly. "Do we have to wait? I've got a little more to finish you off. Come on, I don't blame you."</p> <p>Alicia smiled as she sat up and got off my cock, then took me into her mouth and kissed me hard, then gotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
