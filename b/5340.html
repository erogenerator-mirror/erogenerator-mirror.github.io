I hadn't been very careful in my research studies since my second visit with the local school. It was just that I hadn't been in much of a hurry until I heard from my partner. He told me the school had been running a year off, although he wouldn't admit that he had been doing any better than normal. It was a bit of a shock to meet him, but in hindsight I must have given the same thought to him, and that I owed him. Our sex had been intense, but there was little sex in the world in two seconds, that's what I needed. I didn't love him. I really thought I wanted a relationship elsewhere, but that just seemed wrong. That didn't prove I wasn't married to him. I'd just never done anything like that before.</p> <p>"You are in so much trouble here," she said, walking towards me, "Don't you know why you're here, I have to know why you're here?"</p> <p>"I don't," I said quietly.</p> <p>"Well, I've made arrangements for you to visit my brother and his friends," she said, "I didn't tell that you were here!"</p> <p>I could've cried at that point, but I was still unsure what she was going to do. I needed her, I had to give in and do something. It didn't matter how fast I went through the door now, I needed to make the most of our relationship to me. As it was, I had the answer, I didn't even know how I could tell her. She looked at my face and saw my indecision, she looked down, I couldn't tell whether it was embarrassment in her eyes or relief. She spoke first.</p> <p>"Don't you believe me, Dave?" she said, "You look so silly, can't you see how I'm going to have to deal with everything now?"</p> <p>As good a fuck as she looked, I found I was still a bit nervous. I felt like one of those guys being put through the wringer by his wife. "What if I told him you'd met me here?" I asked, feeling brave but desperate.</p> <p>"You mean, what if he told you he had told you I had lied about meeting him?" she asked, "He probably wouldn't have believed it and would have found you here."</p> <p>Well, at that moment I didn't care. I looked around me, she certainly had. I took hold of her, I knew she couldn't do anything for an instant, but after some more persuasion I was convinced that she would let me go and be my own woman.</p> <p>"That would be so terrible, the worst part would be that I don't want to leave you," I told her, "Just the truth!" I said, pulling her against my body, "I wouldn't do that, ever," I told her, "I wouldn't go looking for someone else."</p> <p>"Please make love to me, Dave," she said as she leaned against me, "I need you inside me."</p> <p>There was no way I could do that, not after all that persuasion. With a small smile, she pulled away and led me from the bathroom, I followed, then stopped and opened a desk drawer. There were condoms and lube in there, even the ones she had, it was a pity that the man I fucked her with had kept his vaseline.</p> <p>"Don't you worry," she said, her arms around my shoulders. "I'm not going to get pregnant if we stay together, it's not like we're trying to kill each other. We don't want to get it on here with you."</p> <p>I nodded, her fingers tracing gently down my body. "I'm sorry about the past," I said, "I just didn't think," I added.</p> <p>"Oh, Dave, please..." she said, still holding my neck, "I want you inside me, just let me have it."</p> <p>We were in the bedroom, she was still wearing her clothes, it was still light out, so I took off my boxers as she pulled off her clothing. She lay down on her back and I knelt between her legs. She must have been thinking hard.</p> <p>"Make love to me, Dave, please," she whispered, "I need it," she said, the words coming out breathy and husky, "please, I can't tell you..."</p> <p>My hands slipped down to her waist and she lifted her hips to meet me. I was aching for her, she was just like the last time we fucked, so wet and excited. I felt the tension, I felt an explosion of energy, she was so tight, she was driving me even wilder. I pushed forward, I pulled back, I pushed again, then I pushed again, it was gloriousâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
