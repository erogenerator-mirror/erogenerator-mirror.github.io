Before too long, I began to pant as well as my breath quickened and my pussy was becoming quite moist. My husband did not have long, but he seemed perfectly content to stare at his fiancée, as he continued to lick and suck her pussy. I was already reaching my orgasm as he pleasured her while I did. I could no longer resist my own desires and I spread my legs. I let him keep himself up, and he did and I moaned his name once more.</p> <p>As the waves of orgasmic pleasure crashed over me, I was so lost in the moment that I didn't even realize his fingers had moved down to my pussy. He began to finger me slowly; his fingers only inches from entering me and not leaving. I tried to hold still with my legs spread as he continued to lick and suck my pussy as I had done to him, but my body was now completely caught in the sensations. I was losing myself again. But this was the moment of truth for me, so I relaxed and allowed my body to enjoy what it was experiencing for the first time in a long time.</p> <p>As my orgasm slowly passed, my husband removed his fingers from inside me. He looked down at me and asked if my orgasm was as good as this one I had just experienced, and I replied that it was. I thought that being so close to him with the taste of myself on his fingers was turning me on as well. I wanted more than anything to give that pleasure to him and now I wanted to see if that pleasure would make him feel the same way that I did as I did the second time. I needed him, but knew that I had to take the initiative. I wanted him inside me again.</p> <p>In a few moments, my body was back on the bed. I was lying on my sides with my legs spread. My husband was lying next to me with his hand in his pants and his mouth locked in a hard, lustful kiss. Our two bodies were kissing and he started to get up, not saying a word. He did this several times, but just to be sure. He did know how to do this, and I knew that he was now my best choice, so I wanted him to take his place. I wanted to feel his naked body beneath me again. He took charge of this new experience from me so he started to move.</p> <p>His lips moved to my shoulder and down to my neck. He stopped at my collar bone. The kiss between my breasts and neck became more passionate. As I reached for his shirt to pull it over his head, his body moved with it. Our bodies were touching and our kisses were becoming more, yet more, passionate as we knew each others' passion was on the rise again. He broke the kiss just long enough to move his neck to suck and lick one of my nipples between his lips.</p> <p>I gasped loudly as I reached for the back of his head. It was then that I felt his hand cup my ass cheeks from behind and he squeezed then gently as he pulled me towards him. The kiss broke and a look of concern came on his beautiful face as he pulled me closer and continued to kiss my neck as he kissed my breasts. His hand moved downward to rub just below my navel. The sensation of his thumb rubbing and circling my navel sent shock after shock of pleasure rippling through my body as I felt his erection press against my thigh. I had reached the point of no return and I wanted him in me as soon as possible. I wanted to get him inside me, make him feel what I had felt in the past.</p> <p>"Oh God", I whispered, "I thought you were going to..."</p> <p>"Oh, but I want you in me too" he answered, still fondling my ass, and I pulled him closer to me. His fingers continued to rub my ass, which sent a shudder of satisfaction through me as he continued to rub and caress it.</p> <p>We kissed each other in such an intense passion that I was afraid that we might rip each others clothes right off, but instead it was as if we were trying not to lose touch with the others. I knew we were both as aroused as I was, and I felt that he too as aroused as I was. He slowly pushed me down onto the bed, still kissing me as his fingers continued to play with my ass.</p> <p>I rolled over, still kissing his lips, moving his left hand to my ass-cheeks and then to my pussy. I was on my back with my hands above my head and he continued to kiss my breasts and stomach. He broke the kiss and moved down as I was to take his cock in my mouth. He moved my mouth around it a bit and I closed my lips around his engorged head—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
