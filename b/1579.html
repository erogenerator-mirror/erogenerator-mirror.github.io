He started moving, really fucking me hard, but I was in love with it. I reached over and pulled his face up to mine. Our mouths were in synch and I was kissing him back. And then he stopped moving and just held still. He held his penis inside me, flexed it a couple of times and slid out a little ways, then just started fucking me again. My ass moved of course and my dick was in full erection, just standing straight and hard and ready. I could feel myself getting more and more excited, a feeling I didn't even know I had.</p> <p>And then he started moving again, slowly, rhythmically moving in almost one direction from deep inside me. Again, our bodies were moving together in synch. It was wonderful. I could feel myself approaching the point of no return. This wasn't my first time; I had already been with a guy and the orgasm was great -- and I would have loved it. But when I came, the feelings were so intense -- I thought I would be sick. I collapsed and went limp on the bed, my hair disheveled. But now he was fucking me really hard, really fast. He was holding on to me so tightly, pulling his dick almost all the way out then in as far as he could take it and then slamming it back in. I was still in some kind of altered state of arousal, my cock hard and throbbing and dripping with a light of precome I couldn't see at all.</p> <p>He wasn't the last man to come. He rolled on his side and turned me over so I was faced the other direction. He started kissing me again, and this time, he didn't make me wear shoes, but kept me naked. I was now completely lost in the kisses, completely overwhelmed by my sexuality. He was kissing me again, and I could feel his hands running up and down my belly and then up my back to my shoulders. I was completely naked again, and he was fully clothed. I felt a hand on each breast as the fingers slid slowly down the outside of the crack in my ass and then up again. His tongue snaked into my mouth and I felt the wetness between my legs against my swollen cock. I moaned.</p> <p>But soon his hand ran down the sides of my cock as his mouth followed and soon, the other hand was stroking my balls as he kept kissing me, licking them, sucking then kissing me. I was in a state of total ecstacy, completely out of my control, totally dependent on the feelings, totally aware of the situation and of the man inside of me. As the man on top me started to kiss me some more, I felt a second set of hands move down to squeeze my cock and start to stroke it. He did it again, and his fingers went back and forth over my skin. The feeling was amazing. And then, just when I wanted it more than anything else, his fingers stroked my balls again.</p> <p>"Please," I whispered. "Please, honey, I want you inside."</p> <p>He looked up at me, smiling and licking his lips, clearly not going to say anything.</p> <p>"I want you. Please. Now. Please," I answered.</p> <p>"I will, baby," he whispered back and then started moving his butt back and forth and my own dick moved in and out of him, making a sloshing sound as I moved back against him.</p> <p>He kissed me and then his lips moved over my mouth and his lips touched mine and then I was kissing him. I kissed him back eagerly and we kissed for a long time. At that point he broke the kiss and rolled over on his back, his hand guiding my own up to put it on him. We continued kissing and caressing for a while. Then he pushed me back toward the end of the bed. And then, we rolled on our sides and he took my cock in his hand and started pumping it. I felt him moving over me. At that point we began kissing really passionately again, but this time when we switched, his hand went back to jacking me off in his mouth. His tongue was flicking across me as his lips slid over me back down to the tip each time.</p> <p>Then he stopped and moved off the bed. I could hear him taking off his clothes. Then he went down on one knee and spread my legs apart. And I could see in my mind's eye the vision of my cock being manhandled by a strong and muscular man who was taking this from a woman in my home, who had to have wanted me inside her body with her mouth a long time. It was the eroticism of it that made it seem to be all true.
