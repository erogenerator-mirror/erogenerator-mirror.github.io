I can do lots of things, but not with you."</p> <p>"Are you saying I'm too big to be able to handle?"</p> <p>She reached down and gave me the most beautiful smile I've ever seen. I leaned over and kissed her. When our lips connected, I was amazed at how gentle and erotic it was. I felt her body melt into mine as she closed her eyes and gave in to the moment.</p> <p>"I can feel you getting warmer."</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Don't be," I said. "Do something you like."</p> <p>She smiled and put her arms around me, pressing my naked body close against her. My dick was pressed up against her crotch. When our lips finally parted, I asked, "Do you want to be on top for that ride?"</p> <p>"Can I give you a ride just a little bit?"</p> <p>I thought I'd hit the wind a little so I didn't let it happen. I had to admit I was very excited about fucking that beautiful naked girl of yours. "I'd love that," I said.</p> <p>"Are you serious?" she asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely."</p> <p>"I thought you might let me put a condom on."</p> <p>"Maybe it wouldn't count," I said.</p> <p>"I have a rule that I keep it to myself. I don't trust myself around you."</p> <p>"Good, I was worried someone had gotten off too quickly."</p> <p>"So, are you going to ride me?"</p> <p>"You don't understand."</p> <p>"How much do you charge?"</p> <p>"I only charge for sex as long as I have a dick, so that's fair."</p> <p>She started unzipping me. "My name is Marla," she said. "I only pay $150."</p> <p>I couldn't believe it. Marla wanted me to fuck her? I thought I was about to die.</p> <p>"I'd be paying $150," I said, pointing to her.</p> <p>"That doesn't count," she said. "I just made a deal."</p> <p>"You didn't make a deal with me, did you?" I said, realizing we were both pretty drunk.</p> <p>She laughed, "That was the deal I made, not me."</p> <p>I didn't know this girl, but she was a very special person. The more I thought about it, the more I knew she was a genuine woman. I couldn't tell if Marla was married, or a lesbian, but I couldn't really remember. This girl had probably had a lot of sex with the customers, and maybe even some friends, all of which were obviously heterosexual.</p> <p>"I don't have a condom, but I'd give you ten inside of me," said Marla.</p> <p>"I'll wait outside for you."</p> <p>I started walking out of the bar and to a bench across the sidewalk. After a few minutes, I sat down and took off my shoes, socks, shirt and pants. She stopped me and wrapped her arms around me. She pulled my shirt out of my shorts, undid my shorts and let them drop.</p> <p>I was already rock-hard. I pulled her against me and she ground her crotch against my dick. I knew the next thing she wanted was for me to finger her pussy. I was so shocked, I just sat there and stared. In a minute she was naked and sliding two of my fingers straight into her pussy, then rubbing her clit with my thumb. The more she thrust on my fingers, the more she liked it. She moaned and cooed, "Do that, baby. I like it when you do that."</p> <p>I moved my other hand to her pussy. I felt the heat of her. I couldn't believe she was getting off on this. As my fingers moved in and out of her, I felt her fingers begin to tighten around mine. I didn't think it would be this easy for them both, but I'd find out in a few moments. As I began to pump my fingers through her hot sheath, Marla's moaned went in even higher.</p> <p>She gasped, "I'm...going to...to come...oh...faster."</p> <p>I looked over to John who had come back to our table.
