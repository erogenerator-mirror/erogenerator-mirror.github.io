Don't tell me what you are talking about, you little whore! You're making up your mind about my cock and letting me in, I can't stand the sight of that, you little bitch!" I screamed at his head and stormed out as fast as I could. "I am going to be gone from here, I've got to stop being like this. Now! Take him with you, and let him go. And don't you dare fucking touch me or I'll tell the boss that his fuck is off. Now run, or I will call the police. And we go!" I snarled, walking over to his desk quickly to tell the man he was to go to whatever he needed to do.</p> <p>I walked away, down the corridor and out again into the corridor again. I was heading to my room when I happened to glance at my reflection in the room's mirror. I looked pretty damn hot and this was exactly what I intended to do to him later. I was going to have sex with a total stranger, and I certainly didn't want to go through that again. I closed my eyes and leaned my head back while I let my hair fall onto my face.</p> <p>I wasn't planning to get any more than this before we left anyway. I just wanted to see if he was worthy of my attentions. So, I started to rub my fingers against my clit as I heard him start to come down the corridor. He started to say something at that point in time to my heart rate and my moaning when he stopped walking and turned to look at me. I could feel him getting hard under his pants as he stood there, and I was happy to have him in my fantasies now.</p> <p>I was so close to him now, so close to him that I didn't care at that moment what I could do to him if someone saw us. But he didn't seem to want to stop me. I had no intention of stopping, there was nothing stopping me now because I had to get myself out of there and out of his way.</p> <p>I was in his hallway, heading back out now when I heard him ask the man if he had seen me at the door. This guy was definitely someone I needed to have sex with in any order. I could smell his manly odor from where I was standing. And I could also hear the slurper of his own pants as he said "Yeah, you fucking slut."</p> <p>I took a step back and opened the door. The man looked over his shoulder at me and I could imagine just how mad he must be. I could see his cock in his pants sticking out obscenely. I took my hand in front of me, and slowly slid the tip of one finger inside my pussy while I still stood, trying to get away before I made a big mistake and pushed myself right into his face.</p> <p>He looked over at me and asked in a low voice, "Do you want to come inside, babe? Can you handle it??" I nodded my head yes even though I wanted to look at his face some more.</p> <p>The boy turned to look at me, and I could see the lust in his eyes as I slowly pushed my hand inside his pants. I was in awe of how long and thick I could get my hand around because his belt was unzipped. I could see his cock as I moved in and out of it, sliding the entire length of it in and out. The boy seemed to like it very much.</p> <p>I could feel my own sex start to throb between my legs as I continued to slide his cock in and out of my fingers. I moved over his desk chair to kneel on the edge. I could feel my tits swinging heavily on me from the motion. The boy moved closer to me while he was still talking. He put his hands on the sides behind my back and started to kiss me deeply while his fingertips began to tickle my sides as he pulled my shirt open.</p> <p>When the boy's tongue pushed its way into my mouth, I sucked it in. I knew I was going to be the first to fuck him, I had done that before. It would be no different then what I have already had. But I didn't want this man to take him from me. There was no way this would be my first time taking him.</p> <p>But I didn't care, because, that was what I wanted to do to this total stranger the entire time I was with him, and even if we never did finish our relationship, this was about to be my best ever fuck ever. I could feel the boy's cock deep inside my pussy as I opened my mouth to let him in, and I let the softest voice I could muster while I started to kiss him deep and passionately.</p> <p>The boy slowly put the top of my shirt over the shirtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
