I stood there for a minute, listening to the rain pour through the window. I could tell my husband would be a bit of an adjustment but I couldn't get him to go to bed tonight. I took a deep, calming breath, sat down, lifted my dress in one swoop, and sat naked for the first time in a long time, for some reason.</p> <p>I was still pretty damp from the beach. I wiped the rain off the bed as I ran my fingers through my hair. I wasn't a real fan of putting it on, but there was something just...different about standing there bare-assed, naked, having my naked body in my house. A lot of what my husband said about wanting me to play with myself had more than that...or was it? I didn't remember my husband doing it, but...well, I was always wet at times in the shower, and I wanted to get wet tonight, especially since he'd left a few hours ago. I reached down, slid a finger into my pussy as the wind blew. The wetness was getting uncomfortable, and I was kind of afraid to get any more in, then it just ran out, and I tried it again, but it slipped easily in. I was pretty wet, but not as wet as I had been at my house, now that I could feel it all in so many places! Just what I hadn't figured out. Well, I guess I should have. I reached down and pushed my fingers back into my pussy, just a little, to test my own wetness.</p> <p>I felt like I'd been doing it for years, and suddenly it felt good, but I wasn't really sure if I liked it or not. I was getting tired, and even though my husband was always out of town...I didn't know if I should go and get myself off to do it. Oh well, my husband's loss.</p> <p>Maybe it was because of the rain. I took out my finger, it was wet again, and I took a little more. I ran my finger down my thigh. My husband never knew, so I wasn't sure I could go all the way. My breath was coming in short, shuddering gasps, and I didn't think that I'd want to come. If the rain had just flowed over the tub, I would've had a bit more trouble. But at the same time, it was kinda neat, that I'd be able to get myself off. I don't know how long I did it, it wasn't exactly long, it was about three minutes. And I was thinking of a game I hadn't done this far before and how much I'd enjoyed it. My hands were still pretty tired, so I picked up my sundress, got dressed, and headed out.</p> <p>I was thinking that I'd start to head back when there was a shadow across the road, then another, and another shadow, and another and another. My eyes shot open at that moment. A shadow was moving in the grass and it seemed pretty close to me. I reached out again and felt my hand being held by what I had just felt, but it was too wet to see the shadow, though I noticed that the foot didn't touch the bed. I had the feeling that I was in the back of a truck, but I was scared for a moment, a sense of safety and vulnerability, but I trusted that if something did happen that I'd get my husband out of here, and then I'd have sex. I leaned back into the truck and tried to think of a way out, to try to get it over before it turned out to be too much.</p> <p>Well, I didn't find the shadow. The rest of the car was dark, or I would have seen something more, or maybe the shadow was closer because I had my eyes half closed. I could hear the truck driver moving through the trees, and then he stopped, and I saw again. The shadow was moving around my face, and then the driver went back around the highway. As the shadow moved across my face, I felt my own eyes slide open a bit wider and there was nothing. There were other shadows across the road, and all around, and my eyes flicked back open a bit at the realization that the person in the truck was another truck driver. And as I was thinking, I thought, that if I was going to be doing that, there was only one thing that I could do. I could get myself off.</p> <p>I sat there thinking, when I heard a voice in my ear. "You're not going anywhere, you know."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I'm not sure that I did anything. What I did know is that I was getting a little horny. Maybe that shouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
