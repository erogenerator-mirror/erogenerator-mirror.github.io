"You'll have room for me in the bath if you want to share me," She whispered.</p> <p>The guy pulled her into him, kissing her softly on the mouth, his warm breath drifting across her neck and across her breasts. She leaned against him so he could kiss them better. Her legs opened automatically, wrapping around his waist. He pressed harder against her, forcing her body to lie down on the bed with him. His hand stroked her lower belly, and the way his fingers brushed her pubic hair were all the way across her clitoris. She tilted her pelvis forward when he finally released her breast. "Mmmm," She felt that familiar little tingling all over and her pussy pulsating. The tingling was from deep inside her, just like the other woman had done to her, and she'd never felt anything quite so intense.</p> <p>"You're so fucking sexy," The guy said against her neck again. His hands trailed up her side and then to her breasts, still covered. He leaned in to lick a nipple and she reached down and pulled the towel aside, making it clear that he could take care of it. His fingers flirted with her clitoris for a second, before he pulled his hand away.</p> <p>"Can you get me hard again?" She couldn't believe how excited she was getting.</p> <p>"Yeah," The guy said, with a grin. He leaned down to kiss her again, then his hand was on her breasts again. She moaned, this time with the anticipation and the thrill for him. His hand was still on her, stroking lightly down her body, back to her pubic hair. She felt his fingers tracing through her bush, then into her opening. She gasped when his middle finger entered her. She could feel her arousal pulsing as it slid up and down her wet folds. She was getting so wet, she wasn't sure she could stand it any longer. "Do you want me inside you?" "God, yes," She said it, as if it was the same thing she had heard on a porn movie. The other lady had wanted to say that, but hadn't been able to convince her to. Not that it mattered now, really. He was doing what the girl had been talking about all night. That was when she'd started to really enjoy herself.</p> <p>"Do it," She wanted to be fucked. "Please."</p> <p>"What do you want?" The guy's voice was very familiar, but she couldn't remember why. If he knew then, perhaps he did now, when he started to work on her. The other woman had said it, but she couldn't remember now. The other woman had been saying it, but she couldn't remember now. She was too close to coming to the point of no return.</p> <p>"I need it."</p> <p>"What?" The other lady sounded excited now.</p> <p>"C'mon, big boy, fuck me. Please. That is what I need." Then she was pleading with him. "Let me feel you up."</p> <p>The guy's hand took the place of the other man's fingers. Now, she was totally helpless as the guy was working on her, trying to drive her over the final edge before she lost consciousness. "Go, fuck, fuck, yes!" She wanted it all, too. She wanted it so badly. "Please," Her voice was a whisper. "That cock, oh, that thick, hard, beautiful cock. Please fuck, I need it."</p> <p>"Good," He said, before leaning over her body again. The wet pressure of his tongue was like something in the air, sending shivers through her body. "Get ready for one more thing." He moved her legs open further. He put first one and then the other foot on the bed, then spread them out, waiting for her to feel the bed against the bottom. The man could just make out just the top of her wet pussy lips as they moved out to the sides beneath the thin blanket. Then he put a fingertip and then an entire finger into her. "Jesus," She gasped. "That's so wonderful. Thank you."</p> <p>The guy held her legs apart as he started to slide his finger around and enter her. He slowly slid it in, then out, then back in. As one finger disappeared deeper in her, the other stayed in. She was almost begging for more. Her feet pulled against his legs to pull him in tighter, and she was still panting. "Fuck me," she whispered. "Don't stop, please." She was practically shouting now. "Fuck me. Put your cock all the way into my pussy. Oh god, it's too bigâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
