It was my turn now, you stood and dropped your shorts and underwear, but left those gorgeous breasts out of your reach.</p> <p>"Come in the bathwater," I said, and I pulled you in behind me. "Let the water run." I pulled your head back against my bosom and hugged you. You were in my arms, and I kissed the tender spot where your neck and shoulder met. I felt the tension you were feeling, and I gently brushed your teeth with my fingers.</p> <p>I turned your head toward me and kissed your lips, your eyes were closed. I slid my tongue out between yours, and as I sucked yours, I felt the blood rise in your nipples and into your vagina. I felt it begin to flow and knew you were responding with a greater intensity. I pressed your breasts a little harder, and my tongue played with yours. You put your hand down between us and took my hard erection in hand, and as you rubbed me, my hand slid higher and found your clit. I felt your warmth and I could not have been happier.</p> <p>"You've found my clit," I told you, and you rubbed it. I knew when it was hard, and you kept rubbing it, moving it around, sometimes pressing it hard. "It's been over a week, and you are excited," I added. I felt your cunt gripping my hand as you ground yourself into my fingers. "And it's time you got the relief of your own," I added. I took your hand and we moved into the tub, and I started to kiss you, and you kissed me with the same feelings. The tub filled up with a wonderful bubbling, and as you kissed me you reached up and grasped me in your hand.</p> <p>"Let's do this properly," I said as I put my hand under the water and started to stroke you. "And let's do your front," I added. You reached down and pulled my erection out toward you, a small drop of pre-come appearing on the tip. I felt you push your way down and slid to me, your lips brushing over them as you took me into your mouth. I slid into you slowly, enjoying the feeling of your warm wet walls enveloping me. We kissed as I entered you, your vagina moving over my rod as it moved in and out of you. I slid out a little now, only to sink into you again. I slid back in, taking your clit into my mouth on each stroke as I slid my hardness deep into you. I kissed and licked your face as I slid out, and I nibbled your cheeks as I slid into you back.</p> <p>I saw your breasts swaying in front of me as I slid in, but mostly I saw you lying down on the towel, spread out for me, my fingers reaching out with one hand to find your nipples. I could not have imagined or anticipated this could be so erotic, your hips moving as I slid into you. I touched and stroked your breasts. The nipples were as I remembered. I pinched and teased them as I drove into you. You raised your hands above your head and I took them in one hand as I lay down over you, pushing myself as deep into you as possible on each stroke, my cock going in and out as I slid against your clitoris. I kissed your neck and shoulders and your breasts as I stroked you there.</p> <p>"I love you," I whispered as I entered you again. You looked up at me, your eyes closed and your hand rubbing my cock as I fucked you. You raised your head and kissed me, your head back and a smile that just lit up your face as you reached out to wrap your arms around my arms and pull each of us closer to the edge of the tub. I couldn't hold it anymore as you cried out in ecstasy. Your legs began to tremble against me as you came.</p> <p>You relaxed as I rolled out of you, lying next to me on the towel. I kissed you and caressed your breasts through your clothing. You began to stroke mine. We kissed again as you worked me, and your hand on my cock caused me to come. I wanted more, but I was not ready to give up yet. You felt it and reached down, taking my hardness in your hand. I held you, and you began to stroke me.</p> <p>As you stroked me with one finger and the tips of your lips, you leaned down and kissed me. You slid your lips down my chest to my aching cock and sucked the tip, sliding your lips down the shaft until you reached the tip. Your mouth opened as you sucked my cock in, the head nudging at the back of your mouth.
