Locking his lips on hers slowly he reaches down and grabs her hips pulling her against his hardness pressing her tight against him. She can feel against the damp fabric of his pants that the outline of his cock had caused.</p> <p>His hands reach under her into her pants grasping her ass cheeks he rolls them gently at first as his tongue dances along her lips, then plunges inside again. He flicks the tip of his tongue playfully across her bottom lip pulling it with his lips and biting firmly.</p> <p>"Please don't stop." She pleads. "Not there...just inside me."</p> <p>His hand travels slowly down her ass until he finds the outline of her panty line. He slowly strokes the line separating her lips and slips his finger inside her. The hot wetness of her pussy causes his digit to slide over her inner folds.</p> <p>"Oh that feels so good." She whispers excitedly.</p> <p>"Just do it." he promises. "I want you to enjoy this."</p> <p>He releases his lips from hers, pushes her against the door and begins pushing her panties down.</p> <p>"What do you think you're doing?" She says struggling against him. "You're tearing my clothes off as soon as I'm nude."</p> <p>"If you keep resisting, I might hurt you." He whispers. "And you're too beautiful to be harmed." he continues.</p> <p>His hands leave her bottom to grasp the sides of her thighs; he pulls her body toward him. She feels him position his cock against her, her head dips with him pressing against her neck. Her pulse quickens in her throat.</p> <p>"Do you feel that?" he asks her quietly, he can tell by her breathing that she does. "Did it hurt?" he asks again gently. "Do you feel that?"</p> <p>Without moving she nods yes and lets her head fall back exposing her neck, he gently presses down against her.</p> <p>"Your skin is so smooth and soft to me." He says before pushing her head back exposing her neck again. "Do you feel that?"</p> <p>"Yes." she manages to gasp out. She feels his mouth on her neck kissing and biting her. His hand slides into her shorts holding his cock against her and begins to push against her. The pressure of his cock is causing her pussy to harden. She can't understand her emotions and doesn't care.</p> <p>He begins moving his hips against her in small long movements while still pulling her ass along with him. His hand moves to her ass and starts to knead the firm flesh. His other hand moves to caress her breast, sliding it around her hardening nipple. His hips thrust slightly back and forth against hers. The feeling of his cock between her legs, the scent of her panties against his body, combined with his strong hands on her ass and his cock against her from behind makes her moan and thrust her hips against him, taking him deeply.</p> <p>A small rumbling moan escapes from her throat. His mouth leaves a kiss along her neck while one hand caress her ass and balls. He can feel her tighten up against him feeling his cock moving against her. He moves closer to her ear and whispers, "Does it bother you?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"What do you think?"</p> <p>"I don't know." she replies breathily. Her eyes close tightly as if her heart is breaking.</p> <p>"You feel like a virgin. I'm not going too far yet." He pulls her toward him pressing him fully against her. "Are you uncomfortable?" he asks.</p> <p>"No of course not."</p> <p>"Let's have it." he whispers into her ear. "I need you so much."</p> <p>His lips move against her shoulder as he pushes down firmly against her. Her eyes lock with his in her haze of pleasure, they move from her face to her neck to her eyes. They're glistening wet. There is no doubt she's turned on by making love with him. She is his, not some other girl...</p> <p>He moves his lips down her neck kissing. Her nipples are like hard little buttons on her breast. He kisses them first one then the other. Slowly his lips slide down her body. A soft moan escapes her lips. Each kiss sends a wave of pleasure through her. His kisses trail down her stomachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
