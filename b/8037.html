I wish I could just say I was your lover. I don't have time to do that right now. You are just what I need. I need you."</p> <p>"My beautiful lover," I whispered as I ran my hand down her back and kissed her shoulder gently. "I'd want more than that. It is just that this is going to start now."</p> <p>As I pulled on her robe she took the covers from around us and we made fast work of the bed. Once again there was no need for any prelimines this time because we wanted everything to really be happening.</p> <p>I moved her onto her back and knelt between her legs. My cock was now fully erect but very swollen. My hand cupped her pussy and her breathing increased. Her outer lips were parted and a small glistening bead of blood formed on top. I gently ran my finger over the bead and found it was the blood of her arousal from the other morning. Her clit was larger now and I ran my finger over it and she gasped. I put her leg over my shoulder and positioned my cock at her entrance. She was wet and very tight.</p> <p>"That's a good girl," I whispered. "Take it in your hand and stroke it. Feel how hot you are. Do a good job, then let me watch you."</p> <p>I felt her body relax and slowly she started to rotate her hips, opening the sheath to me and I slid all the way up into her wet love tunnel. I was fully inserted now and my balls were tightly against my body. I looked up at her face and the expression of joy on it. I leaned down and kissed her lips and she opened her mouth inviting me in. With her legs still around my shoulders, we kissed and my cock slid in and out of her vagina. It felt good to start slowly but within the first three strokes I had a strong urge to put my thumb in her ass. "Oh yes..." she whispered and I pulled her closer to me and started to move my thumb in and out of her anus. She opened her mouth and put her tongue to my ear.</p> <p>"Take me, give me your cock!" she whispered.</p> <p>I put the thumb in her pussy as far as it would go and she pushed back with it. I pushed my cock forward and with each thrust of mine into each inch of her vagina she pressed deeper. My thumb was moving easier now as well as her clit and with each stroke I would press it up to the top of the sheath. Her lips were now sucking gently on mine and our kiss moved toward climax. Suddenly I felt her clench down on me and she was bucking herself up toward me. She began to tremble and her hips pressed forward to meet mine. The waves of her passion hit me with no less force than that in the first place. I felt my balls draw up and the ejaculation begin. My head was thrown back and my body spasmed.</p> <p>She pulled her lips from mine and her hand went to her mouth to suck on my tongue as wave after wave of pleasure overwhelmed me. She pulled me back upright and lay face down on the bed and her hand flew over me with her fingers trying to rub the semen into my skin, but I just didn't care. I loved the way she felt against me and as her fingers probed my chest I could feel the wetness around my cock and feel it against my stomach.</p> <p>She pushed up off the bed and got in the shower. She smiled when she saw the semen on my stomach and then the shower water. I lay there in the tub feeling the cum on my chest, but not quite feeling it. I was very pleased with the day and was surprised that she hadn't been able to control her own desire and the lust she showed.</p> <p>I got out of the shower and pulled a towel to dry my body. My body felt good and I felt so relaxed and happy. I slipped onto my robe and went to the bedroom to dress as she was leaving for work. I felt very satisfied and excited with what could have been the beginning of something wonderful indeed.</p> <p>I dressed and waited as she got out of the shower. The sheath was so wet I could see the water on her breasts. I liked the way they were pressed up against my chest and when I hugged her legs to me I could feel their wet skin against my hips. We kissed and then I dressed. She picked up her robe and put it on then stepped into one of her shoes.</p> <p>"I thought we could take this on my shoulders?" she said as she moved toward me.</p> <p>"Yes. We can take it on our hands, but please let me look at you while you change. It is very important to look as good in the mirror as you are. I really liked the way your robe highlighted all the things that hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
