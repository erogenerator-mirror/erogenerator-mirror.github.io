I'll get you in the door. Let me in."</p> <p>I tried to look in her eyes and pretend nothing happened, but I just kept looking at her like a deer in headlights. I finally felt her arm coming down on my back, and I tried to hold myself in while she ran out. I was just a little stunned, but I quickly looked at her eyes.</p> <p>"Hi," she said as she gave me a quick kiss on my lips. "I'm so sorry I don't know how to say this, but maybe you need to tell me when I get out of here. I just had a little conversation with your mom at the restaurant."</p> <p>My heart skipped a beat while I stared at her, and I couldn't look away. At the very least, she had already told me a little about her and her situation (I'm a sucker for details). I was still looking at her, and her eyes were just staring at me like I was the only other person in the world.</p> <p>"Oh. Uh, I think so," I stammered, still not knowing what to say. "You look like you've been through a lot."</p> <p>She got me in her arms and kissed me right there in front of everybody.</p> <p>It felt weird, but it was the best thing I had ever experienced. When we broke our kiss, she looked right at me and put a little kiss in her lips. Then she looked at her watch and smiled like we were just kids again. She gave me a big hug and I hugged her too. Then she put her arm around me and I could feel our breasts against each other. After a minute, we both pulled back and looked at each other.</p> <p>"Damn," I said. "This is hard to accept. It feels like everyone knows you're a lesbian as hell, and the rest of them are just as weird as you are."</p> <p>"What does that mean?" she asked.</p> <p>We walked into the house and I helped her up the stairs to the guest bedroom. Once we got into the room, we started unbuttoning each other's clothes. I was still a little shaky, but figured this might be more comfortable. After we both stripped down and she kicked off her shoes, I pulled off my bathrobe. We walked into the bedroom and she looked at me and gave me her sexy smile.</p> <p>"Oh, my. That looks uncomfortable. Do you have any idea how much I want to get naked," she asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I said. "I think it would be more comfortable."</p> <p>She stood in front of me, slowly taking it all off, revealing her gorgeous body, clad only in a bikini. Then she was finally down to just her underwear, which were just covering her gorgeous little pussy (she had them in a small package). As she stood in front of me completely naked; it didn't take any of us to move to the bed. Once there, it must have looked like a gymnastic routine, because the sheets only covered half of her body while she sat down. As I walked slowly over to her, I could feel the excitement she was feeling, and I was pretty sure she was feeling it too.</p> <p>"Wow," she said, "that's better. What time should I wake up in?"</p> <p>"Well...uh...tomorrow. In three hours," I said.</p> <p>"That's fine," she said, "I can't wait."</p> <p>She sat up on the edge of the bed and leaned over me, kissing me tenderly. For a second, it felt like a hug, but then her hand reached down and slowly ran from my knee up my inner thigh. She reached the end of the bed and put her hands on my knee, and I started to do the same to her. Just as my hands moved up to where hers were on my thigh, we heard the doorbell ring!</p> <p>"Oh, it's your mom," my mom said into the phone. "Don't worry. We'll be right there in a little bit. Just hurry, I know your dad is probably wondering where your parents are." When her dad opened the door, I gave a little gasp and said "Wow."</p> <p>My mom sat down on the bed and turned the phone off, and she stared at me.</p> <p>"What's up?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nothing," I replied.</p> <p>"What's the matter? Is something bothering you?" she asked.</p> <p>I knew that she was probably right, because I kept looking at her as she came over and sat down next to me. I could hear her soft voice as she said "I don't know. I just feel really weird that way, you know. You're a little weird. Mom seemed a little different to you in a lot of ways, but I really think youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
