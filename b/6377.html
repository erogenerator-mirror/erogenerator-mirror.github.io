I saw that his name was James, and I figured his name was Jeff, but I had no idea that was in the business.</p> <p>"Is anyone from California coming to pick up any more?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Yeah, I've got a flight to New York, and have my parents coming with me." He replied.</p> <p>"Where you from?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Colorado, but have no clue." He said.</p> <p>"Cool, what are you from?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm from New England, and I'd like to start a family." He replied.</p> <p>"Oh... well, you're welcome to come." I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Thank you." He said as we shook hands and he walked off.</p> <p>"This is going to be fun!" Jeff said as he took me to a restaurant.</p> <p>"Yes, this is an experience you won't forget." I said as we were shown to a booth.</p> <p>We ordered a couple of scallions, and we sat down and talked. We were both in our mid to late twenties. We made small talk, and when we were ready to close, we had the same waiter take our order.</p> <p>After our scallions were eaten, we decided to get up and we walked to the elevator. I felt the familiar pang of butterflies in my stomach. I looked in Jeff's direction and he had a look of shock on his face.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" he asked as we entered the elevator.</p> <p>"Do you know who she's from?" I asked. Jeff walked toward me and stood on the other side. My heart was beating even faster this time. I looked into those hypnotic eyes of his and I knew it was going to happen.</p> <p>"No, I don't think so. I think..." he started but the second that he said it, that look of shock on his face made me want to give up. I felt that I had gotten caught in a deep shit, and I was going to have to take a chance. We walked back to the room.</p> <p>"Why does she come here often?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well, I told her that I was traveling on business and she wanted to see me." I said. I was still on the defensive. It was the only thing I could think of to tell him.</p> <p>"But you've only known her for less than two days and she's gone all night." Jeff replied.</p> <p>Jeff pulled a card from his pocket and handed it to my head. I felt the first pang of loss.</p> <p>"Jeff, you can't do that! This is cheating!" I said as I looked in Jeff's eyes.</p> <p>"So you see?" he replied as he handed me the card.</p> <p>"Jeff, you can't do this anymore!" I said as I looked at him.</p> <p>"Well, you did say that you were free from work and that you would meet me at my hotel tomorrow morning at two." He said, taking my hand and leading me to his room. I had a sinking feeling that he wasn't going to take this chance with me. We kissed deeply and I could feel the emotion of the relationship that we shared. It was love at first sight.</p> <p>"Jeff, you are going to have to trust me, and if he takes this step, I will never speak to you again." I whispered in his ear before we kissed again and continued to kiss.</p> <p>"I know it is wrong. We can't stay here forever. Please, give us a chance? Please?" I whispered to him in his ear.</p> <p>"Sure, I think its time to go for a swim." he said as he pulled away from me.</p> <p>Jeff walked over to his bag and picked some clothes out. I went into the bathroom and started to undress.</p> <p>"Don't take your time!" he said as he walked into the bathroom.</p> <p>"I'll go slow and enjoy it." I said as I continued to undress. I stepped into the tub and the first things I saw in Jeff's wardrobe was a small, but sexy, bikini that completely covered my bikini line in every pore. I looked up at him as I slowly slid it up.</p> <p>I was completely naked in front of Jeff. He stared at me with a look I could only describe as desire. It had alluring eyes and I was sure he felt the same way. His eyes darted to my breasts and chest and I could feel the nipples start to swell under the surface.</p> <p>"You have to try it on. Make sureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
