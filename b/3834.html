He continued moving his arms around his friend's torso and began moving his arms over his chest rubbing his shoulders. "You've got a nice rack, too."</p> <p>"I don't mind if you call me that! It's nice to know I'm not the only one who needs a big black man."</p> <p>"Mmmh, I can call you that!"</p> <p>"Mmmmh, I like it!"</p> <p>Jared laughed. "Okay, you're on the way now, I'll walk over and start your exercise. By then, there should be people around and a few drinks in the fridge."</p> <p>The doorbell rang just as Jared opened the door, a middle aged black man with his hair done up in a retro style and wearing an old T-shirt with some sort of wrestling ring on the front. Jared could see that it was the same man who had given a visit to Jared's apartment just before. Before opening the door, Jared saw the black guy from the night before with his arm around his friend's waist.</p> <p>Jared froze in the door as he stared at the man. His mouth went dry as he realized how quickly they had crossed the room. Before he had the chance to take a step, the taller black man grabbed him in a bear hug. "What's going on, this is your roommate!" He exclaimed.</p> <p>Jared was still dumbfounded, but didn't move away. "Hey, is he okay?"</p> <p>The black man chuckled, "That's not what I meant, I just figured you guys might get into it."</p> <p>The man nodded to Jared and let go of Jared. "Yeah, he is, but he's cool. Don't worry about him."</p> <p>Jared followed him in and closed the door again, just before Jared took a step forward. "What the fuck is going on here?" He screamed in anger. He backed up and pushed the door right between Jared's. Jared didn't know what to do. He backed up again, putting his hands in the pockets of his sweat pants. The door opened and someone approached Jared. Jared's heart was racing as he recognized the name-and-tone of his roommate's friend. "Jace?" he snapped.</p> <p>"You can't leave the building!"</p> <p>Jared looked around him. "Isn't the building on-limits?"</p> <p>"Nope...that's my apartment at the end of the hallways."</p> <p>"Alright." he backed up and tried to run, but was only able to get a couple of feet in before his feet kicked off. Jared's fists were clenched and his head snapped back. His eyes met the beautiful eyes of his roommate and his eyes couldn't tear themselves from his.</p> <p>"What the fuck?" He screamed as he kicked at Jared's legs. Jared kicked him out into a hallway only to have the door slam. He cried out and turned to see who it was, but was too late. He was already dead.</p> <p>Jared screamed for help from where he was standing, but couldn't hear any movement. All he could see was the floor, and it looked like someone was laying down nearby. He screamed again as his eyes bulged out in agony. Suddenly he was aware that there were people near him and he immediately rushed over to the person on the floor. They screamed in pain and he rushed down and stood by him. "Are you okay?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm fine!"</p> <p>"Okay, I'll break down the door so you can come get me."</p> <p>Jared was still trying to breathe. "Please! Give me a break. I'll call and tell the police I fucked everything up! You can't come in here like this with me!"</p> <p>"Jared! No, I don't want your job! If that asshole leaves, I'll sue him for all I'm worth and throw you out. I'll tell your parents too. I swear, they'll never have to know..."</p> <p>Jared pushed him away. "Please! I'll do anything. I swear I'll do anything!"</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything, Jared."</p> <p>Jared nodded his head reluctantly and stood up. "Let me get some stuff and we'll go find him and I'll be right there." He grabbed his backpack from his desk in the corner of the kitchen and followed Jared to the living room. "I'm sorry, but I have to talk to you for this."</p> <p>Jared smiled shyly. "Okay."</p> <p>Jared grabbed the door handle as the person lying on the floor pushed aside the blanket covering the body. "Okay, if that's what you think." He walked with Jared to the couch and sat down.
