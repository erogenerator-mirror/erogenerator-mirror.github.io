"I was hoping this night would never have to end..." The kiss grows a little more passionate, but she manages to pull her mouth away with a devilish smile. "I think I'm really beginning to forget how important this is to me."</p> <p>"You're not forgetting," he growls playfully. "Just keep going."</p> <p>"I may need a little coaxing," she giggles as she begins to run her lips up and down his cock again. Before her lips break through the surface of the skin she continues, "I wonder if I can keep this up..." He lets out a moan as she slowly drags her tongue along his length, her hand continuing to slowly rub against his shaft. His eyes close and his head falls back, but even so she can still hear the smile in them. She begins to lick the head of his cock as she slowly pulls her lips completely down over the length of him.</p> <p>"Oh god," Liam murmurs, as he feels her lips and tongue slide along his length. The head of his cock rubs the back of her throat as she slowly begins to bob her head up and down over his shaft.</p> <p>"Mmm, that's good." She can feel his hips starting to push out involuntarily as she slides herself slowly down his shaft. She can hear and feel the groan of pleasure fill his mouth as she pulls her mouth up his length for a second long, slurping kiss. "Oh yes..." she moans as she slides back to the tip of his shaft, again pausing to take him in her mouth.</p> <p>"You are so fucking sexy," Liam groans again as her lips slip all the way down his shaft, her tongue lightly tickling the underside of his cock. Her head continues to bob slowly up and down as her hands glide up and down his thighs, her fingers lightly brushing against his balls. They stay as she keeps this slow, even pace, feeling his cock move with every thrust into her mouth.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you soooo hard with my hot cock," Liam grunts as she lifts her mouth off him. "Is that what you came to say?"</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm," she moans as she looks up at him, her lips still glistening around his shaft. Her hips move slightly toward him, but she continues to bob her head until she has the whole length of him in her mouth. Her hands continue to brush lightly against his thighs, feeling him twitch again while she slowly slides her throat up and down his length.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's what I thought," he hisses as she slowly takes him in, again moving her head up and down. Her head moves forward a little bit more until their gazes lock. The first time they had sex, but even without the sex they'd made up a time and a half ago, when they'd gotten to go wild in the woods, she had been able to get Liam to have sex with her. Since then she'd been able to get him to do it while they sat by the stream topless sunbathing, and as she did that, having her mouth and vagina wrapped around his cock made him think she was a goddess. Now she had taken his cock in her mouth and the whole time she was telling him about how she'd sucked him off.</p> <p>"God, you're a goddess," he grunts as she pulls the shaft out of her mouth as far as it will go. "God, that feels so good," he tells her as she brings both hands back to caressing his balls. "So beautiful." She smiles as she brings her feet up to wrap around his legs and starts to sit back up. "But what about me?"</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she whispers before moving up a little so her wet pussy slides out of the water. She rubs the tip of his cock against the tip of her clit, smiling as it begins to throb against him. His hips thrust back against hers as his tongue finds hers again, this time their tongues entwining for just a second. His hands start to wander over her back as he starts stroking his cock. He can smell the muskiness of her, felt the wetness of her sex as his hand moves slowly up her back and cupped the top of her butt cheeks.</p> <p>The combination of his cock against her sex, his fingers caressing her butt, all the while her mouth finds his as their legs are still wrapped around each other. They moan softly at each other's touch, their moans of pleasure matching the wetness of their lips. Liam's hands move slowly up her body and under her top until they begin to caress the top of her breasts. He moves his mouth slowly down to kissâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
