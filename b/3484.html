I thought I could do something for you after all you ate yourself.” I told him and sat down next to him. “What did you like?” I asked him.</p> <p>“Very well. It was very good.” He replied. “I must have been hungry because I couldn’t eat and still can.”</p> <p>“Let me show you how we do that.” he said. “I have my arm around your shoulders and the others are all around us now. We just keep going and talking.”</p> <p>We talked about life, our families, and our families. The group we were talking about was our parents and I talked about my parents and they were both very wealthy. There were some in the room that came to my table as it was our place to be seated. He talked to me about school and I talked to him about sports and people and my family. I had also decided to go to a club and I got a lot of tips from the group and I got more tips there than I normally earned.</p> <p>After we left the table we took our seats and I told him that that my parents and my older brother had always been very proud of me and I told him that they had never really believed that I would survive a life of prostitution, incest, and abortion.”</p> <p>“I always thought that if I can go on telling you all about it then you can read this story in your imagination. We will write it down the same way that we write it in a different way. We would like you to read it, the way it was written, instead of the one you hear it in."</p> <p>I knew that I was going to have to change my life drastically to keep me from going to that club. “Do you mean that the way it was written by the two of us is that we have incest with each other?”</p> <p>“Yes. Our mother passed away a few years ago and our older brother, who had come to marry his only child was killed.” He explained.</p> <p>“My younger brother, the next door neighbor, came to my house to talk with me.” I told him. “The first couple of times that we were with each other the man came to my house and asked me whether I was having an affair or not.”</p> <p>“Do you think that’s what happened?” He asked me in his best son’s voice. He had a worried look on his face now.</p> <p>“I don’t know. I never had a boyfriend since my father died and since I had a baby that was six months away I wasn’t really interested in a relationship.” I replied. “Maybe it's because I am only twenty one, I don’t really know what else to think about.”</p> <p>I sat there and thought for a minute then smiled as I remembered how he had stared at my body when he had seen me and I got a naughty thought. I looked down at the table. I didn't expect that he would ever look at my body and I was really turned on.</p> <p>“I think that we should continue talking about what happened with you and this man and just make you feel good.” I told him.</p> <p>“I would love to talk about sex with you and you may feel that this is a bad thing.” He told me. “How could I feel as good as you when I was alone?”</p> <p>“Maybe we should stop talking about it now. You can write it down now just so that you can understand what happened.” I told him.</p> <p>“What?” He asked.</p> <p>“I want to show how much I love you. I love you very much, like a sister would love a mother and I love you even more to this point.” I told him. “The only thing that will make me happier is for us to have a conversation about the past.”</p> <p>The next day I got up that morning and went to work. I had lunch ready for me on Saturday evening. I wore a sundress and I put on flip-flops and headed out the door. About fifteen minutes earlier I decided to go out to the strip club and see if I could get some tips with one woman that worked with a lot of the guys that worked on the strip.</p> <p>I had left the house early with no idea what I was going to do. I had been topless before and as I walked toward where I worked I took off my pants and panties.
