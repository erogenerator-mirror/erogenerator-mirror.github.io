"I want to thank you."</p> <p>"There would be a lot of things you could say and do with one another," I said. "But I'm really not done.</p> <p>I got out my phone and dialed my best friend. "Hey, it's me again. I've got a lot of things on my mind. I'm just going to call, and leave the phone in your hands for the night. That sounds more like a date."</p> <p>I knew I had never said "a lot," but if I said I wanted some extra attention, she wouldn't have to look at her phone with it in her hands. "No, no, let me know when my next date is," she promised. "I promise not to let you keep up with the phone."</p> <p>She hung up.</p> <p>And with that, I sat on the front steps of our town house, and I spent the next hour and a half, looking through her pictures, and laughing at a picture of a sexy blonde sitting on the side of the bus. She was wearing a short sleeve skirt that just barely covered the curves of her sexy young ass. She wore a pair of heels that were so high she looked like she could have taken a horse for a week.</p> <p>The next day she was back from a visit with her mother. Both of her parents were going over the family. "I just want you to know that you aren't the only one I love. And if I ever get the urge to have sex with someone again, I'm going to let you know. That's all."</p> <p>As she drove home from the hospital, we chatted about nothing in particular. But the subject turned to love. I loved her and she loved me. It was just a matter of time before we were in love. As we drove home, the thoughts on my mind raced through my mind. I wanted to keep my end of the relationship and just see where it went with her.</p> <p>She saw me in the mirror, and I thought she saw the look in my eyes. That look she saw when she and I went out together. It flashed through my mind again and again. I had told her all about me and her husband, and I thought that when she saw it, she would want to see me again.</p> <p>"It's ok, babe. This is the best thing that's happened to me and I feel the same way about you. That's all."</p> <p>We had dinner and it was wonderful. The tension we experienced was a lot lower that we had experienced in years, which I realized as we sat and talked about everything. The only thing that was worse than eating and talking was trying to be discreet. My mind couldn't even keep my head up for the whole evening. As soon as the words came out, they were meaningless. This was an opportunity and a time to be honest with myself.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I should have stopped you before. I've been married for seven years now and I love my wife and her. Besides, you don't have to justify your decision now."</p> <p>"You don't need to justify your decision, you are fine," I told her, not bothering to change the subject again. "And I do love you."</p> <p>She just grinned. "And it's not like it wasn't an option in my book. I still have two to go before we actually get married. What do you think?"</p> <p>I looked at her and then back to the road. "There's that beautiful face again."</p> <p>"Well, it wasn't all for nothing, was it?" she winked at me and then asked, "Are you a little disappointed that he didn't wait for you after the party last night? I mean, you got to go too."</p> <p>"No, there's nothing to be disappointed about. If some one gets in her car with her, and you go to bed with her, then I'll have to go with you. I promise."</p> <p>We talked about how much our love for one another was a matter of mutual convenience and not a shared passion of a one-lunch affair. It certainly wasn't as if we were just friends in our own way. I told her that there was not a lot to be upset that it wouldn't be me there, but that I had never been that easy to get. And we agreed on the fact that our love for each other was still not just a matter of mutual convenience and not just some mutual relationship. I could have said no, but I knew I loved her. And that there would be no more awkwardness between us. It was not really that, and really wasn't anything to be taken for granted.</p> <p>"I love you," I said, and she smiled.</p> <p>I went back to the hotel, checked into my room, and went toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
