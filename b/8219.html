She was kissing me again, her kiss was passionate. My lips were touching hers. I could still taste my juices in her mouth as we kissed and I could feel the heat of her body as it rose to meet mine in her heat. She kissed me gently, and as we kissed, my hands slid slowly across her breasts, squeezing them. I could feel her nipples hardening under my fingers, and they felt so inviting for me. I felt her hands on my hips, pulling them toward her in the way that my own began to slide down over her body.</p> <p>We slowly began to strip each other's clothes off as we passionately kissed, our bodies entwining in the soft caresses of each other's bodies. As I slowly slid my fingers down her stomach toward her crotch, my mind drifted off into the sensism of the night before. I loved the feel of her body and the smell of her.</p> <p>Her fingers started to undo the buttons of my shirt as she removed it completely. With that one move, her hands were over mine. I put my hands under her body, and found the clasp of her bra, then began to ease the hooks slowly, trying to make those delicate bra unfasten. But it wouldn't budge or close until a very few seconds later, when she let go. I slid the bra away slightly for a moment, and let her soft breasts fall completely out of the cups of the bra, letting them bounce slightly. Then I slid the bra off her shoulders, freeing one of her breasts from its confines. The skin was soft and warm to my touch, so soft, so perfect, and so light as I kissed her.</p> <p>While I was doing this she had slipped one of my shorts and boxers off, her hands quickly sliding them down as she pulled her shorts off. My dick almost jumped from the sheer fabric as soon as it hit it, as she moved her hands in between us and slid my shorts down. As the shorts hit the ground she moved forward and I felt an incredible soft feeling of being engulfed inside her softness, as she let herself wrap around me ever so slightly.</p> <p>When she felt that I was at the point that I could not control myself completely, I let her slide my shorts down, and then I slid all the way off. As I was sitting there naked, with those incredible breasts bouncing free, her nipples looked so inviting, and I really wanted to suck them. They looked so perfect, and I couldn't believe that I was finally doing what I had been fantasizing about for years.</p> <p>She broke the kiss, and began to kiss me again. It felt like we were both naked on the bed together again, her body pressing against my now half-erection. Her hand found my dick, and began to slowly masturbate the length of me with it. I was so hard when her eyes closed completely.</p> <p>A few seconds later, I heard the shower curtain go up. I had a moment of panic. I could not tell if it was a real woman or someone in the shower, because I have never known anyone with such a gorgeous body as hers before. But she made no move to get away, instead she continued rubbing her hand up and down across her pussy while she continued kissing me.</p> <p>The water continued to run down my body, and my dick kept on getting harder, as she kept playing and rubbing, moving from my right to my left, until our eyes met.</p> <p>She took her hand away from my dick and turned the shower off. I slid off the bed and followed her, turning around to help her under the spray. A few seconds of her facing me while she was washing up was enough for me, so I slid down to kiss her again. I felt her hand go to my cock, but she quickly turned around and pulled me out.</p> <p>“I can wash you myself just like this.” She said as she slowly licked around the head of my dick.”</p> <p>I could only moan in response, as she began to lather the length of my dick with her soapy hands. After what seemed like an eternity it began to slide up and down my length very nicely.</p> <p>When it was almost all the way up, she turned it around, so that my dick was pointing straight up to the right, and I felt her breasts pressed against my stomach. This was my first real sexual experience with another woman, and I could not believe how beautiful and different it felt. When she began to move her head toward me, I grabbed the waistband of her bottoms, and pulled them down slightly. She giggled, still giggling when I slid the bikini top off her body and tossed it to the floor.</p> <p>Now fully naked—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
