The first surge was like nothing she had ever felt, a feeling of intense pleasure, a rush of heat flowing through her body. She could see that he was staring at her, breathing heavily.</p> <p>He pulled her down and pressed her tight against his body. Then he lifted her chin with his hand as they kissed again, a softening passionate kiss with just a hint of tongue. His hands ran through her hair as the tip of his tongue teased her lips, her mouth quivering when she finally allowed it into her mouth. The next blast was as sudden as he'd been, so strong that she was momentarily surprised.</p> <p>"What was that?" she squeaked at him, the sound barely audible over the rapidity of his breathing. "Oh wow!"</p> <p>He was still holding her tight and didn't move. It didn't last long, though. She didn't know what it was until it happened again. "I was just starting to get a little carried away, that's all," he said.</p> <p>She couldn't help but feel a little guilty about what she was feeling. The taste of his cum in her mouth, the feel of his erection pressed against her backside, the feeling of having sex with him with her own son... well, she'd just had a few drinks and thought that it probably wouldn't be that bad.</p> <p>"Sorry," she said as they broke their lip lock. "I think I'm getting a little drunk again."</p> <p>"It's okay. Here, let me hold you so we don't get carried off." And he led her into the living room.</p> <p>"You're a bit more sober now," was her response but she was already feeling a little drunk.</p> <p>"Thanks," he replied. But he wasn't letting up on it at all.</p> <p>"I'm ready now," she said and stepped over him as they reached the sofa. She'd only put her panties back on, so there didn't really seem to be anything to remove them from.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want your panties?" he whispered as he leaned close to her to kiss her.</p> <p>"I don't know... I'm kind of scared," she said with a smile and a little nervous twinge to her stomach.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed her softly, a long and lingering slow kiss with one hand. Once he'd worked his lips back off her cheek, he pulled back.</p> <p>"Do you want to keep them?" he asked with a chuckle.</p> <p>"I guess," she mumbled.</p> <p>With only a trace of a smile, his thumb ran down her chin and stopped just before she had a chance to take several breaths.</p> <p>"You know, I don't know what that's going to feel like," she mumbled as she pulled away.</p> <p>"Not at all," he said, and pulled her into a full embrace.</p> <p>His lips found hers, and their tongues immediately began a sensual dance. She ran her hands over his back and up again, caressing his neck as they kissed. She felt an electric current course through her body from her lips to her breasts as it continued. He rolled his hips against hers, his cock pressing deep inside of her. It had to be a good indication that she needed a bit of relief.</p> <p>She felt the first stirrings of an orgasm in her as he continued to deepen the kiss with his tongue. She was in the grips of the first, then the second, then the third orgasm, until she was almost screaming in her excitement at the peak of ecstasy.</p> <p>Once he was finished, he slid his lips back slowly and then lifted her gently and set her back on the sofa. He was the gentleman that she'd always wished she'd had the chance to be. But he hadn't come on to her in the way she always fantasized - just a quick one.</p> <p>She felt her heart jump from her chest as he lifted her top over her head and placed her hands on the back of the sofa. He removed his jacket and she saw what she had been wanting. It was a sexy black and black and white striped shirt with a blue trimline through the front tied at the waist with a red bow. The shirt buttoned up the two sides loosely, and she saw that he'd folded her shirt a number of times into a bow. The fabric looked like a little red bow tied in a row at the back. She reached for the neckline of the shirt, but he pushed her hands away.</p> <p>At that moment, she had no idea what was coming next. "No..." she whispered.</p> <p>"I like that," he replied, smiling as he finished taking off the shirt and dropped it to the floor.</p> <p>Thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
