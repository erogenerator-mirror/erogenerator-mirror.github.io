The sound of her voice took my breath away. I'd been out of the bathroom before too. And it seemed like it seemed like the first time in years.</p> <p>She ran her hand down my back, the light touch sent a tingle through my body. "You seem to like that. And you're ready when I happen to be away on that trip."</p> <p>"You're right." I replied. Her hand made slow, lazy caresses along my spine and then down to my ass. I could feel the tight cheeks beneath her fingertips. "You're always wet. Just like the girls in your videos."</p> <p>"I just like this better," she smiled, and she pulled me tight against her. We kissed again. Her tongue tasted of mint, and the feel of her strong hands on my back and ass, while she sucked on my lips, slowly and passionately. I felt a little lightheaded right now. I couldn't get enough of her kisses.</p> <p>I knew what I wanted.</p> <p>And her hands stroking me slowly down to my cock, her fingers fumbling at my jeans. Her fingers had gotten there in the first place. I stood, my hands on the railing as I helped her pull her shirt over her head, over her head and down. I felt her body leaning back against the railing, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as she pulled her shirt from her body.</p> <p>I was shocked, but I quickly let go and reached around her, removing her panties from her. She was completely naked now, the air in the hallway quickly changing to another level of excitement. It was her turn to moan slightly. But I had no problem pulling them off and diving back in.</p> <p>I knew what I wanted.</p> <p>But I was still a long ways away. And she knew what I wanted. She looked up at me with a pouty mouth, but smiled as she felt my lips on her nipples and moved them over herself, the hair in her pits tickling her skin as I sucked them into my mouth. Her thighs gripped my neck as I took my time. I could still feel the tingle beginning in her knees starting to press against my cheeks and up her thighs.</p> <p>As my hands slid down her stomach, my fingers found that soft blonde bush between her legs. Her pussy was nice and soft, her lips moist and pink. I could smell the juices in the crotch of her panties and I pressed my mouth in between her breasts, sucking at her nipples one at a time, feeling the hard nubs in the soft skin of her tits against my teeth.</p> <p>I moved my mouth back, kissing along her neck as I worked my hands down to her ass, pulling the cheeks apart as I moved up to her pussy. She pulled her leg back with a groan as I buried my face between her legs. She held my face between her thighs, grinding against me as I kissed her inner thighs. As I kissed her, I heard her make little noises with each flick of her tongue against my lips. I felt her hips start to buck against my tongue as I teased her. I worked my tongue in a circle again and again, her lips trembling as they opened for me. She was going wild, her hips shaking now. I could feel her juices as they mixed and spread on the backs of my fingers.</p> <p>It was too much. My balls tightened and I plunged in as far as I could go, burying myself in her warm wet pussy as she moaned and arched her back. I felt the last wave of pleasure as it swept over me.</p> <p>"Oh my god," she whispered.</p> <p>But she was still breathing heavily. I sat for a moment, my breath coming in ragged bursts. She moved against me, her thigh resting against my cock, my fingers pressing into the bed above me. She kissed me again, her lips soft against mine as her tongue slipped between my lips, tangling with mine again.</p> <p>But I knew what I wanted. She was ready, maybe even excited. I moved my hips a bit, feeling a little resistance as we had done in her videos. But I pushed into her slowly, feeling her hips buck again as I sunk into her with a groan. She moaned softly, and I felt my cock sliding into her, a little more slowly at first. She was holding herself up as her eyes watched me and opened wider.</p> <p>I pulled my face away from hers and looked down at her as I began to slowly fuck her, my cock sliding back and forth into her. We both moaned softly as the head of my cock pushed in and out of her.</p> <p>"So good," she whispered, her tongue darting out to press against my lips as she kissed my lips again.</p> <p>"Fuck me. Fuck me now," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
