Cum in me, cum in me!"</p> <p>I had never felt better to have someone's orgasm explode through me. I was lost in a deep trance as my hand continued to milk his shaft and milk his cum up into my cervix. After my initial shock, I had found my way into a new place, that place that I never wanted to even think of.</p> <p>His penis finally softened and withdrew from my vagina. It was the hardest thing that I had ever experienced. My body was a wreck. I was weak from being held up, but I could not move. I was also afraid to speak, especially without the strength to do so I could barely see my friends and family in the hallway.</p> <p>I collapsed face down and drifted off to sleep. When I awoke later that morning, I was alone in bed. As I looked towards the hallway, there were both of my friends, hugging one another. I had been with three very close friends last night before it was time to be with both of my friends. I tried to speak but only garbled my voice as I shook my head. I looked at the girls and began to wonder what had happened in my apartment so quickly. This was still something that I had never experienced, yet I had known how my first thought was to try and move out of the apartment and I had succeeded. I remembered the first time I had followed her upstairs and when I pulled her back into my arms I had made love to her. We went to bed and I fucked her in the middle of the night knowing that if I ever did see her again, I would be sure to tell her that it was in my bed.</p> <p>The next day I decided to visit a book store that I had heard about on my way home and then I would have to return to work at the bookstore for something else to discuss when I met Laura. I walked through the store with several books on lesbian sex. I was lost in the romance and lesbian sex so much that I could barely keep my hands off my partner if not mine and I enjoyed the book but I had to admit that my body was getting a workout from the erotic thoughts that came my way. Once in the book counter I purchased a small book on being a lesbian and went home to watch television. That was my favorite time to be at home, having to spend my evening watching porno and pleasuring myself. I knew that I wouldn't hear from Laura or that I would have to say something.</p> <p>About a month later, I approached Laura on my lunch break. I was in the middle of my third drink after a busy day for the next two days and I finally felt good enough that I asked her to join me for another round of drinks that I had made all to myself for that extra hour. I had finished off two of our fourths so I knew that this could be my chance to get even with her that night.</p> <p>When she finally got home, I poured her a glass of wine. She took a sip then said "How come you never asked me out on our date?"</p> <p>"Well, Laura, I always knew that you were not into me when we got together. I think that you are the first girl that I have been with to date in your life. I never told you the whole story. It is something that I have never done."</p> <p>"I am not so sure about it" she responded. "I don't have any trouble being with you. The things that I thought about on the phone must have taken place. The fact that we have been so compatible over the last month is the only thing that makes each of us even with me. I never let you out of my sight ever. I had almost felt sorry for you that first time." I was almost to tears at the mention of our night before.</p> <p>"And we did?" I asked, surprised at the answer.</p> <p>"Yes, we did. Before I knew what was happening when I had been standing in the restroom on the way to the restroom I was fucking you in front of everyone."</p> <p>"It is strange! I had no idea that someone could feel guilty as I had. I am not sure about that. I should not have come to you for such comfort. I should not have been able to tell you that I was going to make love to you all over again."</p> <p>"The thing is, it wasn't because I am not gay, but because all of a sudden I found myself making love to you again. So, it did not mean that I was going to continue to date you, let alone even be intimate with you. We just made up our mind that there would be no end to it if we wanted it to be. We are still friends are we not?"</p> <p>"No, we are not. We have never had such an emotional connection with each other as weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
