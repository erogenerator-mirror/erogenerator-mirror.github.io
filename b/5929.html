He looked at his watch and realized that her time was nearly up. He looked around the room and then down to the note on her desk. It read:</p> <p>"Mrs. L. L., I've made arrangements to spend the day working next door to the pool. I hope that you'll come for a visit. I understand that my husband is away for several days in meetings.</p> <p>We understand.</p> <p>Mrs. L."</p> <p>She looked at the note and then back at me, "Is that...?"</p> <p>I waved her back to the office. "It's a courtesy note," I told her.</p> <p>"I'm going to the pool. I'm going to soak in the hot tub. It's my way to soak. What do you think?"</p> <p>"I don't know about the hot tub," he said.</p> <p>"It doesn't seem to bother me," she replied as she stepped into the room.</p> <p>"It does bother me," he said.</p> <p>"What did you expect? It's not something that I was looking forward to."</p> <p>"Not at all, it's probably something to do with you, Mrs. L.," he answered with a smile.</p> <p>She looked at him for a long moment and then asked, "Do you mean that? Well, I was hoping I'd find someone to play with while I was here."</p> <p>"Mrs. L. . . ."</p> <p>She turned, looked at me, "I'm not looking for a man to just play with me," she told him.</p> <p>"But you are, Mrs. L.," he began.</p> <p>"No, no, no. Not at all. I'm not here to just play with another man." She looked at the note and then back at him saying, "Look, maybe that will be all right. Now."</p> <p>She turned to face him, "I do appreciate that you are willing to play with me, but I'm going to be a little uncomfortable. Do you have an objection that I should use another woman?"</p> <p>"You don't have to be a bitch to play with me. I understand."</p> <p>"No I don't," she smiled. I looked at her, looked at her face, at her beautiful blue eyes. "I was going to ask you an important question," she smiled.</p> <p>"Yes, I guess it is."</p> <p>"And," she continued, "I wouldn't want you to play with me if you knew that I would be doing it."</p> <p>"Well, yeah, you could put up with that for a little while. Maybe then, you can ask me."</p> <p>That brought a smile to her lips and she said, "I just hope,"</p> <p>I smiled back at her and then said, "Okay, then, see you later."</p> <p>"See you later," she responded.</p> <p>"Now be careful," I warned him.</p> <p>"You're in a world of your own. Besides, it might be more fun if you just take a break and come in here and wait?"</p> <p>"It isn't that!"</p> <p>"Why not? There's plenty of time to play before I have to get back out there."</p> <p>"That won't be much fun," she answered with a chuckle. "I might have another beer or two in the refrigerator later at my place."</p> <p>"Yes, it is. I didn't bring much with me from home, besides a couple of beer bottles. Are you coming back with me?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm going to be gone for a few days and then I'll be back. I'm also going to have some dinner with you," she added.</p> <p>"Great. It'll be fun."</p> <p>"We'll see," she said as she turned and walked down the hall to the pool, "Now, what did I miss?" I replied.</p> <p>"Nothing," she told him, "you just made time for a good time."</p> <p>"Well, you need to get out of those clothes," I told him.</p> <p>He looked at her, then nodded and went to the room.</p> <p>"I'll bet that is a hot tub for you," she noted. "I'll bet you will make fun of all the pool guests and what they say to each other."</p> <p>"Well, it is," he replied sheepishly.</p> <p>She smiled with delight as she closed the door and then she took my right hand and placed it on her breast. "It might be a long time before I see another man with a big bulge in his pants, but the thought is still there," she remarked with a smile.</p> <p>"This is the most fun you've had in a long time and I don't want you to regret it," I toldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
