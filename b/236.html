At eight inches, he was average sized. But, it was a beautiful hard-on. I couldn't resist reaching down to stroke it gently.</p> <p>In the past, when I masturbated by hand, my own dick stayed soft. But, that's never happened. Now, he was a beautiful piece of meat that had been in me just moments before. He had thick, brown, curly hair, and a wide, muscled body that covered his massive tool. I was sure it was thick enough that I could probably take him in a heartbeat. He would not be able to. It just took a moment or two for me to realize how big it was.</p> <p>I slowly turned my head toward him, still stroking it slowly. My long, dark hair hung down around my waist and rested on his lap. I looked up at him and could see that he was already reaching his hand out toward me, slowly stroking his shaft. I moved into him just a tiny bit, taking him between my lips. I moved on his shaft with my tongue. I felt the tip just about slip in. I slowly stroked my hand up and down his shaft and felt his balls begin to swell. I could feel him throbbing.</p> <p>He was breathing deeply. He had no idea that this was happening. I put my mouth down at the tip of the cock that was now fully filling my mouth, and slowly pushed my head further under the desk. I had just the right amount of pre-cum to make it easy for him to slide that hot, thick shaft up in my mouth.</p> <p>Once I had positioned the tip underneath the small of his back, it slipped easily inside. It was so different from the dildos I had used on my own before. It slid in more easily.</p> <p>I began to stroke his rod slowly with my mouth. I looked up at him as I did. I could tell he was starting to lose control. With each stroke, his hips twitched harder and his head moved in and out of my tight, wet mouth with each stroke. He began to gasp and moan as he held my head still, allowing himself to go deeper. I knew he was getting close.</p> <p>He was almost there, his body was straining and he held my head in place. Then he exploded in my mouth. Blast after blast shot into the back of my mouth, I could taste the bitter salty taste of him. I could taste the warm, salty taste of him and I had to try to keep from gagging. He never pulled out of my mouth. I quickly brought his dick back to its original position, letting him fuck my mouth. He kept it there for a long moment until he was finally spent. He pulled his throbbing dick from my mouth. He was breathing rapidly now, his eyes were almost bugging out.</p> <p>We both stood up, looking down at me. My legs were a little shaky, and I had a throbbing ache in my legs. I knew I couldn't walk up to him tomorrow, so I would be safe and sound to him. I reached for his pants and pulled him down next to me. He leaned over and kissed me again, softly, but fiercely, his arms wrapping around me, pulling me down on top of him still hard.</p> <p>"I will be back before noon, baby" he whispered to me.</p> <p>I nodded, and he turned to leave.</p> <p>"But, I'm still horny" I whispered to him.</p> <p>He paused just before he walked out the door.</p> <p>"Shit, baby, you are already 18! How the hell did you get so much experience in math?" he shouted to me, laughing.</p> <p>"I've been wanting to do this for so long. I thought I was going to die out of desireâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
