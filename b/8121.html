She kissed me on the lips again and she stroked me, with her hands.</p> <p>My hand reached down towards her pussy. I felt her wetness, I was excited. She looked back at me and started licking my cock again. I started moaning, and her pussy felt good on my fingers. She started licking me with passion. She kept me in her mouth, I started groaning, and she looked up at me, and grinned with delight. Then she slowly started sucking me, I looked at her mouth, her mouth, and her lips looked so inviting. I just held on and looked at her. It was incredible, she was looking at me, like a woman, and I loved her. She sucked a little quicker, and sucked faster. My body felt in ecstacy, my muscles tightened and I just held on to her. I was going to cum, and I just couldn't hold it. I grunted and let her lips leave my cock.</p> <p>"My God, your cum feels so good," she said, grinning, holding in my body, which I was enjoying so much, "I hope it's strong for you." I laughed. She smiled like a beautiful angel. That made me happy. I felt so happy. She looked up at me and said: "We're really going to do this right. Maybe we can do it again some time. We're getting married a week from now."</p> <p>There was silence as I lay on the bed. "You were fantastic!" she whispered. "I was looking forward to doing this for you."</p> <p>"Thank you, that means a lot."</p> <p>"Thank you for letting me come all over you, honey, I love doing it."</p> <p>This time I lay there, content. I looked up at the stars, and felt safe, content for the first time. We had both been so good to me before. It felt like a dream come to lifeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
