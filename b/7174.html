I don't remember eating anything but my own breakfast before." I smile.</p> <p>"Oh, yes I know it will be good, my mom is a great cook and would love to start me off with a bacon stuffed sausage, she really likes it."</p> <p>I can't keep myself from laughing at her analogy. I am really not sure I can keep from calling her mom, I mean, I can't really think of mom in this way, not really. I just can't think of her in a way other than my mom. She is just so beautiful, and beautiful and beautiful. She really is very pretty. Maybe better to be described as beautiful, but not pretty enough to be called beautiful.</p> <p>"I guess you are right, but to answer your second question, I don't think so. I think I know where we would have started this, but I don't remember or care to think about it."</p> <p>"That's ok, I don't mind at all." she says, looking up at my face and giving me a look of total sincerity.</p> <p>I look deep into my eyes. "No, I don't mind at all."</p> <p>You know, I was really thinking about how much I liked her. I was thinking about how much I liked her. We had been friends for a long time, and I've never had such an important relationship with another woman. We are both good friends. I really would rather go out on a date than have sex with her. But it doesn't mean that I really don't think it would be a good time to start with sex, at least not anything more than kissing.</p> <p>It is nice to be able to hold on to things with a great friend and not be embarrassed by how they have to be, so we can just go on with our date. After this evening, we will see where we would, and let each other in on the details. So lets just enjoy good food, and good sex to begin with.</p> <p>I was thinking about how much I really liked her, especially where her body was, especially her breasts. I still don't think I really think about her sexually when I touch her. I just think of her in a woman's body, she looks much better than she does. I know she is not the kind of person who would look good in a suit and not wear it, you know what women are like, and they are not that type of woman, you know what I mean.</p> <p>So here I am, talking with a beautiful woman that thinks the way I do. She says the perfect combination.</p> <p>Yes, the perfect combination, and I think I really like all of her.</p> <p>- - - - -</p> <p>The dinner went fine. She was very relaxed. I noticed as we sat out on the patio eating, while talking, she kept looking at me, as if I should turn to look at her. She is always smiling at me. We chatted about how wonderful it was to finally meet each other, and the way the events were really made. She has this way of making me feel like I don't know where I am and what I am doing, she smiles all the time, it is so natural and so nice to get a hug with a friend, like this time.</p> <p>I was still looking at her, and she could tell it was time to go upstairs for a swim. I went up to her room, and laid back on her bed. I was looking around the room and she got up to use the bathroom. I thought, well, what the hell, why not?</p> <p>She came back downstairs and sat down next to me. "I don't know why you didn't turn the lights off all of a sudden, I was just about to do the same thing."</p> <p>"It's a good thing the light is off and the room is pretty dark tonight." I smiled.</p> <p>We started talking about how we were going to have to do it. She told me how she likes to go to the grocery store with me, and how they always had the first box in the cart with the items in the basket. I think she was happy with the way things were going. I looked at her and smiled, and her expression was one of happiness. For some reason, she said she liked the feeling of something big in her.</p> <p>"Maybe I should get you one." I said.</p> <p>"No, we don't need a baby, but it seems right." Her face lit up at my saying that.</p> <p>"Ok, that's very nice to hear." I smiled at her again, and she reached over and put her hand on my knee.</p> <p>We were both looking around the room together. I really liked herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
