That’s okay. I can control myself. Don’t worry, you won’t have to think of everything else just to fuck the woman you want.”</p> <p>I smiled as I felt her body relax against mine and I knew she was going to go slowly. When she finally felt comfortable with what we were about to do, we kissed deeply. She could feel my tongue enter her mouth and it only served to excite her more.</p> <p>I felt her hand between her thighs and I could feel her fingernails playfully dragging over my thigh before she pulled it up over my cock slowly. She felt completely under my control by not even realizing it.</p> <p>I kept my hands on her shoulders, which were soft and warm, while we continued our kiss and groping. Our breathing became uneven and we knew there was no stopping either of us for this. She felt mine slowly and passionately against hers but I was so turned on it wasn’t just me that was turned on but her reaction to it.</p> <p>As my cock slid between our bodies and found it’s way between her legs, it felt so incredible. I could hardly hold back my own excitement, so I told her so.</p> <p>“We should move the room.” I said between kisses.</p> <p>“No, we’re here.”</p> <p>I heard her say the words but I’m so close now, I want you.”</p> <p>I felt her body relax and almost immediately, I was there myself. It felt as good as it felt when we fucked each other.</p> <p>We kissed and groped for a while, and then I made it a point to move my arm around until I could get my hand under hers. I found my way between her thighs and found them moist, ready, dripping.</p> <p>I felt the tip of her pussy as I gently touched it, wet. I took her right hand in mine and brought it over me so that her fingers could play with me too. Her body felt so good it was almost like a drug. So good, that I wanted nothing more than to put my cock where it belonged and have our first fuck. She made an occasional push against it.</p> <p>“Come on, you know you want it, it’s okay. I want it too.”</p> <p>She felt so good around me. I felt her tongue licking at the bottom of my shaft. I heard a slight moan as she did it and I put my hand on her breast, feeling the softness under his palm.</p> <p>Her fingernails caressed my thigh as I felt her own legs spreading for my cock. In no time, I wanted it. I wanted to take off her dress and put my cock inside. In no time at all her pussy was soaking my hand again.</p> <p>I heard another sigh and knew it was because I knew she couldn’t wait anymore. She made herself move with me as fast as possible and I felt her start to make that moaning sound again. God, she was so hot, so wet and so hot. My cock throbbed as I felt the juices gush around it.</p> <p>I brought my mouth around to her ear and whispered, “We’re here.”</p> <p>She smiled with a look of pure pleasure and she whispered, “We’re here.”</p> <p>I took off her sweater and bra, throwing her skirt down onto the floor. I found her breasts with my mouth and sucked them, pulling and pinching on her nipples which had become as hard as pencil nipples. I licked around the tip and could feel them tighten. God, her breath was getting shorter and she felt like she was going to scream.</p> <p>I moved back over her and we kissed and I licked her ear once again as she felt my cock sliding on inside her. God, I wanted to take off her clothes. She was so warm and soft. I just didn’t think I could take a chance.</p> <p>I looked at her face and saw her look over at me, then at him. He saw her looking and smiled. She smiled back, and I felt the smile grow as too did her expression. He moved closer and kissed her cheek before he kissed her lips for her turn.</p> <p>She didn’t kiss him in return but just took my cock in hand and pointed it towards her pussy. I thought she thought it was okay so I pushed it down as she lowered herself onto it, feeling its entire width fill her again.</p> <p>I felt her body tighten around me once again but I wanted more.</p> <p>I moved her hips up and down the length of my cock until she felt me come closer, feeling her pussy squeeze around me as her body tensed. I felt her pussy contract around my cock and I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
