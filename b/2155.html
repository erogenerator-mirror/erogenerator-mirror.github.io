I got myself in the sack with her, but we're almost like twins. Now she is, what do you think? You think we'd both be happy to share our bodies with each other? She doesn't seem to mind, at least not in this situation."</p> <p>Sam laughed. "Maybe not, but I do. I think we'd be the perfect mates."</p> <p>"I think you are," said Jane. "But what about you? Have you slept with another girl before, do you know?"</p> <p>"Well, yes," said Jane. "Amber got me. And no, I haven't, but we both know that you are in the picture. That's fine with me, Sam."</p> <p>Sam felt awkward about what they had just agreed to do, especially with their bodies in close proximity. She wasn't sure what she was feeling, but her inhibitions were gone. She was still turned on by the events of the previous night, but she was ready to continue, particularly after the long and sensual night she had enjoyed the previous night with her boyfriend.</p> <p>"We are a team, aren't we?" asked Jane.</p> <p>Sam nodded again. But it still didn't seem right to them to be sharing the bodies of a man and a woman, but there didn't seem to be any real harm in it.</p> <p>"Maybe a little" said Jane as she looked at Sam, "But I won't tell you what to do. That's all between us."</p> <p>Jane picked up the remote control and pressed play, taking a moment to enjoy the picture of Sam's body. The music blared out around her. The room dimmed and Sam felt the intensity increase, the erotic tension of the previous night rising. The two women, still dressed as they were, embraced and kissed each other, with their hips dancing together in lust. The lights turned off.</p> <p>Jane turned back to the man with her arm around him. The other two women, their arms entwining and their breasts pressing against each other, came to their knees. The man took hold of both of them, his head thrown back. Jane's hands kneaded their breasts while the other one kissed him and gently licked his ear, tracing his cheek and licking his throat. Their tongues explored each other's mouths. Their breathing grew heavier and louder.</p> <p>Jane broke away and sat down again on the sofa, next to him. The other woman, with her hips lifted, straddling his groin with her legs. Her pelvis was pressed firmly against his leg and Sam found himself feeling wet warmth and wet mouth. The three women were now naked and Sam was amazed that they had come straight here to sleep, rather than someplace else. He was equally astonished that neither of them had taken their clothes off, and he found himself wondering if two naked women were going to make him cum.</p> <p>Jane pushed Sam onto his back, her body still on his, and began to play with his erection. She stroked at him, teasing him with her fingers, which were glistening with juices. Her own breasts thrust out, and the nipples were rigid, standing out from her chest. Sam's face was turned towards them, his eyes still locked to hers when Jane reached around to grab his right nipple, which was hard and erect, his response to her touch obvious. Jane pulled harder on Sam's nipple, and squeezed harder on the other when she felt Jane's hand reach down and grasp his cock.</p> <p>Sam was very turned on, and his fingers worked against Jane's clit as she continued to tug on his cock. One stroke at a time, he was surprised at the way Jane was responding, the excitement of the situation increasing. His fingers went deeper inside her, while his cock felt thicker and longer.</p> <p>Then he felt Jane's tongue flick across his cock, which made Sam shudder. She sucked hard on Sam's cock, licking it before taking him in deep. Sam's hips were bucking, and it was all too much as Jane's tongue licked hard along the sensitive underside, drawing a wet line to his balls. Jane's head was bobbing fast, and then slowed, pulling his cock out of her mouth, causing Sam to gasp his appreciation.</p> <p>After three or four strokes he felt his balls tighten at that point, and he pulled hard on Jane's hair and began to thrust up to meet her. She continued to suck on him, feeling him swelling and growing, so she slowed her hand in his lap, knowing just what to do to his cock, knowing just how hard it was. She began to rub against the base of it, getting it all wet with her saliva, and then licked at the vein on its side. And so Sam thrust, lifting his hips towards her mouth to bring it to contact with her tongue.
