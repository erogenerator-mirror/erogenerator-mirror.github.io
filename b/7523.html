She had changed back into her robe and a robe that went well with her hair and makeup and the dress she was wearing. They walked out of the house, kissed her, and then started down the driveway. She walked back up the drive, turned around and kissed him on the lips. "Did you think they would all love me?" she asked playfully.</p> <p>"Of course I did, they did, they all love you." He replied. He felt a surge from her and he knew that she was going to take advantage of the opportunity. He told himself that it really had nothing to do with him being married but that the idea was also the one he had been wanting to ask Jenny about. She had answered their door, asked what he wanted, and then had left him speechless. She then walked up the walk and kissed his cheek.</p> <p>"What are you thinking," he laughed, "about the answer to that question."</p> <p>"I was thinking that my dress would look like that in the right light. I didn't ask them for a date, I didn't have to make up my mind. You know, that's when they start to kiss each other, and the kiss goes away. I'm still figuring where I could get to a point where I can walk around looking like that."</p> <p>"Where do you find this dress? This dress fits you right. If it had been a guy."</p> <p>"I have a friend like that," she laughed, "I don't know the dress is a size too small, but he doesn't wear dresses like that. I think I would look great in it."</p> <p>"I'm thinking about doing something a LOT different before we go back to the bedroom..." he thought to himself.</p> <p>"That idea is probably about the last thing I said before we turn around and go back to bed?" she asked, "What if we do nothing but lay down and do what we just did?"</p> <p>"That's great," he said, "that sounds like a great idea. We'll have to get some time together to talk about it and get to know each other."</p> <p>"OK," she said, "Let's stay a few more minutes and then we can decide where to go next." They left for the house.</p> <p>They found their way back down the dark hallway, got a beer and sat down to discuss it. When they got out of the shadows they both giggled.</p> <p>"Why does it taste different from the first time we've had sex, does it make it better?" she asked him.</p> <p>"It does, and that's why it tasted so good," he replied.</p> <p>"We should get out of here and try this again...we really want to do something that we do a lot!" she giggled again. As she got up to her feet they started taking off each other's clothes. Her skirt was a thin cotton type with little or no lace at all. Her top was a deep shade of black in the nude and she was wearing a black and black lace bra and a pair of black thong panties. They were wearing matching lace stockings she had bought this morning. She leaned over to kiss him, but stopped at the doorway.</p> <p>"I want you to take off my panties too," she said, "then I'm going to sit on the bed and let you have me."</p> <p>He sat up and quickly pulled his own panties off and they both fell to the floor. She kissed him again and then knelt over his face. "I want the first time to be so long and comfortable that we just let it be," she said as she kissed his penis. She took his penis in her mouth slowly and kissed his stomach as she did so. When she felt he was ready she stopped. He told her to stop and got up.</p> <p>"We have to get some sleep. I'm starving. Go to the store, have some more things brought to your room."</p> <p>"I don't know what you need or think of for lunch," she replied.</p> <p>"It's all gone now and there's plenty of food left here," he said to get some attention.</p> <p>"I'll get some pizza, what do you usually eat?" she asked after looking at his pizza tray.</p> <p>"I don't always have any," he said. "What are you hungry for? Do you want any?"</p> <p>"I'll get some bread and a Coke."</p> <p>After he had put the pizza in the oven he took her face in his hands and kissed her. She kissed him back as she felt his penis under her hand. "I'm hungry for you," she said, "right now!"</p> <p>They got upstairs to the bedroom. He opened her gown and kissed her lips and neck. She put up her arms to his waist and they fell on each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
