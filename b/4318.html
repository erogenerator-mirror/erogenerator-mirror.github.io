It had grown even harder than she had imagined. There was some pain, not like before, but it certainly felt like it. Her stomach felt like it was going to burst with anticipation. His kiss was soft, but with a hint of hunger. He lifted his head and looked deep into her eyes. He was a good kisser and knew what to say.</p> <p>"I want you." She kissed him again, a little shakily. His mouth pulled away, her eyes met his. She wanted that again, badly. But she knew he wouldn't be rough with her. He leaned in and took her mouth again, his tongue probing her mouth and then entering her mouth. His finger moved to stroke her side and she moved her arms from his chest, reaching out for it, her body trembling under his touch.</p> <p>He let his tongue play with hers for a second, then slid his hand down her side to her hip. He pulled her dress up as his fingers passed over her mound and he felt the damp line of her underwear. "How does it feel?"</p> <p>Hesitating her answer was almost an impossibility. "It feels... amazing." She wanted to scream but he broke their kiss, leaned down to her ear and said huskily. "I want you again." His lips trailed down to her neck and he nipped at the tender flesh there. She thought she might cum just from that, but it only intensified the pleasure as his fingers slid off her panties. He lifted her hips again toward him, his eyes never leaving hers; he had a look of hunger in them, no doubt, what he wanted that she had never imagined with him. His voice was quiet as he said her name. "I want you so much."</p> <p>Her fingers found his, holding in a silent plea. "Please," she whispered between her teeth.</p> <p>"Please what?"</p> <p>"Make love to me." His lips brushed her ear, leaving her feeling bereft with his words. She looked him in the eyes, then she felt the heat of his lips, kissing her skin again. There was a fire in his eyes. "I've wanted to do this for a long time." She felt his lips move along her neck and she felt her body grow hotter with each soft kiss. "I've wanted this for a long time." She felt her nipples harden and when she tried to hold them away, he kissed them and she gasped. He moved his fingers to the small of her back and she tried to arch, trying to feel more of his touch, but he put his fingers on the top of her panties and slowly started sliding it down.</p> <p>His fingers reached her lips first and she felt him push against her and he stopped, holding the panties with one hand as he slid his lips down her neck. He kissed her collarbone where it joined her shoulder, then ran one hand through the line of blonde thatch between her breasts. "I don't know why, but I just can't get enough of you." He kissed her other breast and slowly worked his way down her body again. She felt his lips move and felt her body tense.</p> <p>He moved up her body, his tongue reaching to touch her nipples and she felt herself surrendering to his touch. He kissed her again, pulling away and looked into her eyes. "Do you want me to make love to you?"</p> <p>She shook her head. "No, I just told you not to move." He was pleased, he knew it, he liked that, but he needed to take her.</p> <p>His tongue flicked her nipple, she moaned under his touch and when his hand moved over her other breast, she felt her body tremble. "I want you." She was still holding his head when he kissed her lower lip. "I want you." His hand was back between her legs, stroking, sliding, pushing, pressing harder and she felt a tiny wet spot between her thighs. Then his arm was back on her as he moved his head over her body, kissing, licking, then finally working it's way over her skin as his hand continued to stroke and touch her. He pressed his mouth against her and kissed a path down her chest, over her stomach and she felt a surge between her legs, then something was cold and hard against her. She let out a tiny gasp as her head shot up and she felt two of his fingers move deep in her wetness. "Oh god!" Her hips rocked up and down, her body on fire.</p> <p>Gently he was moving his other hand, sliding it up her leg, and he knew that she was ready. "Please."
