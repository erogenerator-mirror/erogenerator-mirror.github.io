"And he might not want to go to a strip club."</p> <p>"Me either."</p> <p>I rolled out of bed, walked into the kitchen, and found him right where he left off a few minutes earlier.</p> <p>I pulled up my nightgown, tossed my purse onto the couch, and walked over to the nightstand on the other end. I quickly opened the drawer and found my little vibe, slipped my shorts off and laid it on top. I turned it on, pressed it against myself, and just pressed a button. I heard his footsteps as he walked out the door.</p> <p>Once he was gone I set it on the nightstand, climbed in next to him, and held his head in my hands. "I want you tonight."</p> <p>"I know," he said, and ran his finger through my hair. "I missed you."</p> <p>I leaned to kiss him. "And I missed you too."</p> <p>We laid there for a few minutes, before our lips separated. I stood up and got out of bed. I turned on the other light in the room. It was still fairly early at night, it was probably only 9:00. I grabbed my robe and headed down the stairs.</p> <p>When I got back into the living room, Frank was sitting beside the sofa. He smiled as he saw me, and handed me my robe.</p> <p>"Ready for another drink, then?" he asked.</p> <p>"Uh, yeah," I said.</p> <p>"Me too," he said, and took it from my hand as I walked into the living room. I sat by him on the sofa. We talked for a bit before he asked me, "Can I... talk to you about something a little more personal?"</p> <p>It was about 10:00. He needed to leave so I went upstairs and picked up some things that I needed for the next week. I found a little red wine, a couple of cans of Pepsi, and a small vial of water. I brought them to him and sat him on the sofa next to me. "So, how about you stay late?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't think that'd be a good idea, but you know how I feel about having sex with someone else. Why?"</p> <p>I looked over at the open bottle of water. "It's not like we're in a relationship. I am not attracted to other girls. It's just another girl on the same bed. You can't really make out with her in any real way." I laughed. "There's not a lot of girls interested in me." I sat and drank my water.</p> <p>"You want me to stay?"</p> <p>"I... I want you," I said. "I don't want to get you into trouble. It's just that I'm really glad you agreed to stay." He smiled.</p> <p>I took a large drink from the vial. "So, you're single then?"</p> <p>"No," he said. "A friend of mine called last week. He moved out of town last week. The job he was doing now is pretty big for him. It's kind of like an apartment he's never staying at."</p> <p>"I didn't know this was your place," I said.</p> <p>"It's my apartment," he said. "It's my house too."</p> <p>"I'm serious," I said.</p> <p>"We'll see," he said. We lay there holding each other.</p> <p>It wasn't long before my cellphone started to vibrate inside my purse. "What's that?" I asked.</p> <p>"I got to leave early," he said. "I told Frank I couldn't wait until he was in town."</p> <p>"Well, that's really good news," I said. "I can still come up and see you."</p> <p>"I can," he said, and handed my phone back. He took it off and gave me another look.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "That ought to do it."</p> <p>It didn't. I was beginning to get paranoid again.</p> <p>"Well, you're staying at my place tonight," he said, "so long as you stay by my side." I smiled with him.</p> <p>"I think I could probably use some help," I said as we packed up our things. He was looking forward to starting work on Friday.</p> <p>It was a while, but my body was responding to him more and more. Soon I was lying naked next to him in my bed, his arm across my breasts. We lay there for a long time. I was still feeling uncomfortable, not having sex with him. I hadn't had sex since we firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
