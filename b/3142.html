"You're already in trouble, don't worry; you'll find yourself doing much worse then this in no time." He said as he slowly stroked through the cleft in her pubic hair, tickling the outer edge of her labia. She writhed against him, grinding her mound against his groin. He could feel a stirring in his loins. His erection surged as he watched her face, eyes closed as she savoured the sensations running through her body. "Just what am I supposed to feel like with you?" He asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know." She replied. A flush turned from her cheeks up her neck to her breasts where she felt the cool caress of his skin as he ran his fingers up her body and traced round to the nape of her neck. Then he moved on, his lips brushing over her shoulder, his tongue teasing her as she tilted her head down, welcoming him into her mouth. He felt her body, and moved his hand to where he wanted it to be before he stopped.</p> <p>They both had our groins covered in sweat by the time he stopped her from grinding against him. "I'm about ready to come, so you need to do it for me."</p> <p>She smiled, her lips glistening with the exertion of her efforts while she watched his face for his reaction. Her gaze moved across his body towards where his erection lay straining against him; the head swollen, slick with her juices. She could not suppress a shudder of desire. He wanted to join in, but he knew that they would not achieve that pleasure together. She knelt over him, her hair falling loose around her shoulders. He slid to his stomach, leaning forward, his erection bobbing under her hip. When his lips brushed against her collarbone again, she jumped, the sensation flooding over her.</p> <p>He pulled her down onto him, pushing at her until she was reclined on his chest, his arms still around her waist and her legs around his waist. He rolled over to lay flat on her and her legs splayed apart, her lips brushing his chest as she breathed in the muskiness of his hair. He moved his arms back to caress her breasts; her nipples responded to his strokes, hardening almost instantly beneath his touch.</p> <p>She could just feel the tension between his legs as she pushed down to rub against him; when she moved back up her breath caught, and she felt a wave of pleasure wash over her, as his lips brushed her neck again. She was on the very edge of orgasm when she felt something new; he must have pushed two fingers deep inside her, just to start.</p> <p>Her head flew back and her eyelids opened in astonishment. "You're insistent" she said to him, gasping while she came, arching her back and arching her hips as the thrill of orgasm overwhelmed her. That first, intense release triggered his own and he exploded inside her as he came, his seed pumping into her.</p> <p></p> <p>*</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed that. I am waiting for the next chapter.
