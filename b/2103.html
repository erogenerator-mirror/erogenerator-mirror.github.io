Is that it?"</p> <p>"It might have been a good idea. After all, my family did the same thing this past fall. They never left this island so they'll never leave you anyway."</p> <p>"Do you have to ask?"</p> <p>"Nope. I've heard you out there from here. I'm just waiting for what's coming that will kill me. I guess if I can kill you with all the drugs I'm carrying."</p> <p>She had changed the subject to something else. "You know, I just realized something. I was thinking I have a special gift for you. I thought you might like it, too."</p> <p>She held the small parcel of gold to her chest. "If you really liked it, I hope you don't hate it, and if you do, would you give it to me?"</p> <p>She did.</p> <p>"I'll try to remember it tomorrow. I'll get right on in time for my dinner then. Bye."</p> <p>The following Monday, Alicia knocked gently on her father's door. "Can we meet tomorrow around ten so we can talk for a bit?"</p> <p>"Of course. I'll go pick out some lunch."</p> <p>"There is a restaurant just off campus over there where we can get out of the sun a little faster than you'd have thought. We can talk there."</p> <p>He agreed and he had to work a little closer than his home town. As he drove, he began to wonder if Alicia had decided to come to a party too. And, if she had, did she choose the right party as well? It would be hard to find good music if it were so dark on the first dance. He found it hard to concentrate on anything in the kitchen as Alicia appeared ready for him with lunch and coffee.</p> <p>"How was your evening?" she asked.</p> <p>"Good, it was nice. The boys made me promise to have another one of the movies with them before next week. And they told me how to find them and I can make this one."</p> <p>"Oh, my. You've done quite some good thinking with this one."</p> <p>When they ate, they talked more and Alicia said, "I really like this new thing you're wearing. Maybe I shouldn't have bought it, if you're not happy with how it's going to look at first."</p> <p>"Maybe I'm not happy."</p> <p>"I don't know, honey. I have a good feeling about what you're capable of doing. And I'm going to be with you when you get home."</p> <p>"I guess that works for me. But what exactly is that, anyway?"</p> <p>"I need to be sure. I also need to know what kind of man you are. Are you ready for that, or are you scared?"</p> <p>"I'm not scared. And I'm not scared of the people I love. But, I'm scared of how I'm going to react to these kinds of feelings."</p> <p>"I am too, sweetheart. I am going to be with you to begin with, but I will tell you at some point as soon as I get home that you'll be fine. But, it won't be your fault."</p> <p>"No, it shouldn't be. I'm not ready."</p> <p>"You're ready? That makes two of us."</p> <p>That evening was a special occasion for Alicia. And she could feel things beginning to develop for her when they did their last kiss together. And there she was with a man that had always been her heart and soul and her closest friend. And they had been together for a good time. And there was no need for Alicia to come down to the beach to pick out her dinner. If she felt she was ready for any eventuality, she would accept the invitation.</p> <p>And she told her father, "Will you really try to pick me up?"</p> <p>He said he was going to help her find her way and they said goodnight and he drove off. But, he still had to go to school on Friday. He gave Alicia another hug and a goodbye.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I'll bet you're good in bed. You might want to be a little slower to learn what to do on occasion."</p> <p>"I'm okay. I'll just get better with practice. And the new game will teach me a lot more about where I can put myself in the right position."</p> <p>She kissed him and then they fell asleep. She would be ready for anything he wanted, even if she could tell his mind wasn't ready to say anything.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>When Alicia returned to the houseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
