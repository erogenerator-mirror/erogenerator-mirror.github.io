She looked down with a pained expression. "My pussy is really sore."</p> <p>"Well, what happened?" He sat up and pulled a handkerchief out from under his pillow and began to wipe the blood that seemed to be sticking to his fingers.</p> <p>"I don't think I fucked you." Her head came over to his face and she leaned down to kiss him softly. "I'm not sure I can get all of you out." He could feel her nipples digging into his chest and their tongues met. One of her hands moved over his stomach and down to grasp his cock again. "Damn, it's not going loose." He didn't have any real reaction. He didn't even have any sperm on his arm but he was already fully erect. She broke the kiss and then slid her body down his.</p> <p>"Damn it, you're too big; you're much too big." He began to thrust his hips but with no room to move they were held together in a tight squeeze. He didn't have any experience in this area so it was a little painful. He thought she would soon be out and was hoping that he wouldn't hurt her.</p> <p>After a few minutes he felt her body begin to squirm and knew that it wasn't going to be long. In answer he leaned back and put his hands on either arm of the recliner and put his weight on his legs. "I'm going to come."</p> <p>"Wait, you don't want to come, do you?" He took his handkerchief from his arm and wiped her pussy lips once again and it wasn't the wetness that indicated it.</p> <p>"No, I mean, I really want the night to start back at what the movie did to me." She looked up and smiled at him.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want this?" She asked with a pout.</p> <p>"Oh yes, it's the night."</p> <p>"But you don't want to come?"</p> <p>He felt his stomach lurch and knew he had gotten the upper hand.</p> <p>"Oh, I was almost there."</p> <p>"Let's get a room. I had so many ideas and didn't know anything about anything in that house that would get me up and in bed that night." She climbed the stairs and he took her arm as they went up them.</p> <p>The night felt fantastic and they found a comfortable bed and laid there for a while. She finally spoke up first. "I think I am going to need one more to do this. I think I'm going to need a little more." Her hand was down under the covers with his cock still stiff but pointing directly up.</p> <p>"I like the way your hand felt last night." He kissed her and ran a hand through her hair. "I think I could fall asleep here tonight and wake up in a little while tomorrow and see what happened."</p> <p>"This might not be the best idea." She looked up and saw the way his eyes felt on her as the blood began to pump through his cock. She slowly moved her hips as though she had done it dozens of times but he had moved his hand again to her pussy.</p> <p>"I think I have to go and have a shower before I go back to work tomorrow. It's not really clean, not as well as the house, but there are just a few things that needed to be washed, washed, washed and washed. There are also a few ways to go about it but I'll probably do them in the morning." His hands began a slow and steady massage as though they had done it before and for the first time in years he didn't think it would be long. Her hips began to move as though they had been doing it for years and he held her hip with his other hand.</p> <p>His hips began to move more and his cock moved with them with as much of his body as it could muster. She began to sigh and moan out with each stroke. "You're going to make me cum so fast." He took his hand away and began to kiss a drop of blood. "Here, put your hand at the base of my cock so I can give you a hand job to keep from coming." She moved on top of him and guided his cock into her pussy. There was no need for her to be gentle and she felt herself getting wet.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that feels nice." Her hands squeezed his ass as he moved his hands to her chest. "You're not moving too fast but I guess you'll really enjoy it." He moved her to lean back on him. Her head rested on his shoulder and her legs began to sway. They were still coupled but now he had a view of her full breasts hanging down and swaying over his chest each time they moved. They movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
