She stopped to kiss me on the cheek, then gave me a quick lick along my jawline before taking her phone from her bag.</p> <p>"Now, we'll get to work," she said with a wink.</p> <p>She took another picture from her phone.</p> <p>"Mmmm, we'll see," I said, "Now, off with your pants and get over here and start doing what you promised."</p> <p>"Oh no, I'm not finished yet," she teased. "You can leave my panties and bra on."</p> <p>So I did the same thing as I heard the door lock as she walked into the bedroom, her eyes closed and head tilted back as I finished undressing. I took just about the same step of her panties and slowly pushed them down her legs. She lifted and held them, letting my fingers slip in gently as they pulled her lower lips apart. She opened her legs for me, looking down at me as I got ready to take off her bra. She let me slip it off as well, and then, like me, leaned forward to help me out of my shirt.</p> <p>"Now, off with your shirt."</p> <p>She reached for it with one hand and pulled it off. Her back and shoulders were bare, her nipples standing out firm. I reached for the waistband of her pants as she turned to help with her buttons, letting her fall to the floor. I looked down, then up at her face, which had a grin like mine.</p> <p>"I can't believe how happy I am," she told me in that tone of hers. "I'm so glad you thought of this."</p> <p>"Me too, I was going to wait for you, but this is the least I can do for you," and I finished pulling her pants off. She lay back in the chair and crossed her legs, her eyes closed in anticipation. I got the panties off myself and pulled up my own shorts.</p> <p>Sandy laid down on the bed, her hips rising from the pillows. I pulled my shorts down and off, the soft hair between her legs, lightly tickling her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes!" she breathed into the air. "It's been so long. You made me feel like I've been waiting for."</p> <p>Her hips rose in response and she leaned up to slide my tongue into her mouth again. I wrapped my arms around her and kissed her passionately, my free hand sliding down her back and over her ass. It tickled slightly and then she spread her legs to get to my hand.</p> <p>"No, this feels so good," she breathed into my mouth. "You make my life so much more exciting."</p> <p>"I want you to do this, with me," I told her. "Do you think it's a good idea?"</p> <p>"More fun," she told me as she pushed up against my hand and pressed our bodies together.</p> <p>I ran my finger inside her, feeling the slight resistance of her cunt around it. I could feel her clit, the tiny bud that grew and protruded from its hood, begging for attention. It seemed like she was in the mood to make love to me there, maybe even to my cock as she leaned into me for her own pleasure, but I didn't care. If my girlfriend wanted to be tied up again, or just used for her sexual pleasure, maybe this was as good a time as any.</p> <p>I pulled her back towards me and started kissing her all over, my hand moving up and down her back and hips as her hips moved in response and she started kissing my chest with more hunger. My fingers explored her, gently touching her anus, her hips pressing against mine as she kissed me deeply. When I thought her fingers were getting tired, she pulled back and laid back again.</p> <p>"I want us to get this right," she managed to say.</p> <p>"So do I," I answered, feeling her smile as her tongue probed my mouth.</p> <p>Sandy got my shorts and boxers off, tossing them out onto the bed. I kicked them free as well, and then she took my cock in her hand and rubbed some precum over the head, watching as it hardened. She rubbed it along the shaft a few times, and then leaned back and started kissing the shaft up and down again. She moved her hand up and down the length of it, moving closer to the head with each stroke.</p> <p>"Tell me when to stop," she told me.</p> <p>"Okay, okay, I'll go slow."</p> <p>She moved the lips of her mouth to the head, then opened her mouth and let it slide down to the base. She was so warm and delicious. Sandy was kissing me, her fingers moving slowly along my cock, slowly massaging meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
