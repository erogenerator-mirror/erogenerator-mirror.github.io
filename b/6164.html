One hand moved to my chest, tweaking my nipples. I heard him move away from my ass and then felt his hands on my thighs, spreading them wide as he buried his face between my legs.</p> <p>"No!" I yelled. "Not like this, not now."</p> <p>But his lips pressed against my labia, and I felt his tongue touch me, first flicking against my sex, then slowly sliding up my slit.</p> <p>"No," I repeated. "Not yet."</p> <p>"But not yet," he said. "That's not a good idea. You are so wet and tight," he said with a grin. He sucked my clitoris into his mouth, running his tongue up and down the length of it, causing me to moan.</p> <p>"I'll teach you," I said, my voice rising. "I'll do anything you want -- anything you want!"</p> <p>I felt something pushing against my pussy, trying to fit itself inside me, and he said, "Go."</p> <p>With one finger he pushed my lips aside, stretching me as far open as it would go. He pulled back slightly, then pressed forward again and slid inside me, pushing deeper and deeper, until it was lodged fully inside my body.</p> <p>I pulled my hips up toward him, trying to spread them wider.</p> <p>"Wait," I said.</p> <p>He pushed further inside me, and I felt it stretch me as it moved into me, past my stomach, and then I could feel it start to penetrate me. Then my insides spasmed.</p> <p>"No," I said and pushed at him, trying to get him inside me. I felt his hand holding me open, but then I felt his lips press against my vulva, and they were wrapped around my sex, gently sucking.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" he asked. "Do you like being made love to?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, "yes, I like it, too."</p> <p>"Beg me, sweetheart," he said, "Beg me for me to fuck you."</p> <p>"Please," I said. "Use me."</p> <p>His lips slid back, and I felt him slide inside me, pressing against my walls. My insides squeezed him, and I felt his erection slide between my buttocks, pressing my pussy up against my anus. After a moment of resistance, the pressure against my anus began to ease, and my insides slid easily on him.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, OH!" I moaned as he slipped his member into me, and his hands moved on my hips. I could feel his hands under my body, stroking my body, my hips, my stomach -- his thumbs sliding over my breasts, his fingers squeezing my nipples as his hips moved back and forth inside me, his hips against my body, his hands under my body squeezing me.</p> <p>My hands squeezed his back, digging my nails into his flesh as he slid into me.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, oh!" I moaned.</p> <p>He kissed the side of my neck then, and I heard him say, "No more, sweetheart," as he pulled out of me. My body felt weak and numb as my insides slid back onto him. I felt him move up my body, his hardness rubbing against my wetness as he pressed himself inside me. I bit my lip as his hands pressed against the side of my face, forcing them to stay closed. I closed my eyes as his hands began to stroke my body, running over my breasts, rubbing my nipples against them.</p> <p>He pushed himself inside me again, a few more inches inside me right before he pulled out.</p> <p>"No, not yet."</p> <p>My body felt weak, and it was my fault for saying no to the pleasure he gave me.</p> <p>"Come," he said as he pulled himself out of me again.</p> <p>"No," I said, as I felt him move down the bed and pull me up toward him. I had never done anything in the way of sex before, so I did not know what I wanted or expected. I had never known him to want to come inside me, let me fuck him, let me touch myself, to cum inside me. I tried to relax my body, afraid I'd be unable to do anything else, but my mind was in overdrive, and my body was overcome with an internal orgasm. I held my breath as I felt him slide himself inside me, pushing himself in as far as he could go.</p> <p>"Yes," I cried out. "Faster!"</p> <p>His face moved closer to mine as he said, "I want nothing more than to make you have the same orgasm youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
