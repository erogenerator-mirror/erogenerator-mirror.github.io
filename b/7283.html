I'm sorry." I looked at the screen, but couldn't believe that it was half an hour past 10 pm and there I was sitting across from a guy who could have been any man's girlfriend, even one that I had just fucked and left hanging. The door to the apartment swung open and before my eyes could adjust to the bright, day light, he was standing right outside. Without a word, he opened the door for me and closed it behind him.</p> <p>"So, you're the girl that had sex with Ryan?" I asked, my head dropping to my hands.</p> <p>"I've been with Ryan for quite a time," he began, "and there's a lot to talk about." He paused a second, took in my expression, and went on, "How can I tell your friends that I've fucked Ryan, because I'm one of those men that I'm fucking when I want to and I don't know who I'm fucking for?" I heard him sigh and my eyes grew large.</p> <p>"Look, if I want to see it in person, I'll go." I said.</p> <p>Ryan looked at the clock, "I'll get some beers, I'm sorry," he said and went back to his bag before going inside. I followed him quickly, my head still below the waist, and I got a beer from a fridge that I picked up in the corner. The guy had gone inside before me as I had, so I waited until he left before coming closer to him. He was a little shorter than Ryan, maybe 5'5" and about 140 and looked like somebody that was just as fit since they always went on diets. The bulge in his shorts looked familiar, but I couldn't place it yet but as we came closer I noticed that he was wearing a pair of light blue cargo shorts. He had a broad, muscular back that showed off a lot of skin from the light brown hair on his head all the way down his back. I stood back as close as I could and looked down. The shorts were loose, a little too loose to be comfortable but I could still see his thick, meaty, cock, which looked longer than it probably should have been. The cock-head looked as thick as a plum, and the length itself was well above average -- only a very short seven or eight inches. It was so large, and hung heavy, that it hung down in between the rest of his body and his legs as he sat. I swallowed a little and saw myself looking at it. I felt myself growing damp.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" I said, not knowing what else to do.</p> <p>"Yeah, I like big cocks," he answered.</p> <p>I couldn't believe that this was actually happening. His roommate, Ryan? That's crazy.</p> <p>"Ryan!" I said in a shocked tone of voice, surprised for a second to hear myself say it, in a nervous voice. "I don't think so."</p> <p>"Sure he does," the guy smiled, reaching up and placing his big hand on my thigh before looking back to the road. "I fucked him all night this morning."</p> <p>"Me too," I said, unable to believe the truth that was suddenly spilling out of my mouth, "but we'll get back to that." I turned my head to look at the road once more, my hands covering my tits. I was a good actress and this was a joke that had a chance to break up the situation. His hand was sliding up from my thigh and I felt his fingers tracing along my crotch. I didn't dare do a thing, I'd been sitting there like I was having a heart attack and he was so close.</p> <p>"I'm serious," I said, realizing that I was being a little too loud, "I've gotten laid in front of Ryan all morning, but he just looked a little over the top. He seemed not to really know why. He just looked in my eyes and smiled, which is probably why I was so nervous. He told me that I'd have to show him one of the new video sites -- an adult site that I haven't yet, so I'm going to show him one of my new videos. He's got a really great one, and it's so good that Ryan has some great stuff on it." I was still sitting on the couch and his hand reached higher and his fingers touched my pussy, my legs opening up slightly. I didn't want to do it, but I couldn't move as he slipped his thumb into my slit.</p> <p>'Oh, God' I thought, 'I'm in trouble.' I looked around. Our room was in the back of the shop, the door to the apartment's door was closed, we could just get out of here as soon as we got something to drink.
