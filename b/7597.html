I said as I tossed her a book. She looked at me with anger in her eyes and pulled her hands away from her backside, putting her book down. She then tossed her other book at my feet.</p> <p>"I think that you'd better tell me how to get here, and you won't be able to find the phone."</p> <p>"I think you got that right. Now what do you want?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Well, I think it might be best if you start by telling me what to do, and what you need."</p> <p>She thought for a minute and then her beautiful body seemed to turn my way again. She sat back and closed her eyes. She placed her hands on her hips and let her head drop back. I put my hands on her thighs. I ran my fingers up over her lips and then began to rub them softly. She opened them just a bit more to let my finger slide between them again. I pulled my hand away and put it directly on her.</p> <p>"Mmmm. This feels so good. Let me get started. Do you know you have already had more orgasms this day than you had in your life?" I asked as my finger slid back and forth along the lips of her pussy. She let a little moan out of her. I moved my finger up and down along her slit getting a more wet coating and getting a small bit of her juices on my finger. I brought my finger back up to her clit and very gently rubbed it. She had a small smile on her lips. I looked down at her. "Do you want me to stop." She opened her eyes and looked up at me. "You can stop right now if you want." The way she said it made me hard again at the moment that she really wanted me to make good on her promise. I moved my finger back up to her clit again. She smiled again as my finger slid up and down her slit. "Mmm. I'm enjoying this." She let out a small grunt. I moved my finger along her slit a little quicker so that she would start to feel it. I slipped my finger inside her now.</p> <p>"I didn't tell you my name." "I heard that I can't go that far, and it hurts, so I guess I can start calling you 'Daddy'." I said looking down at her. She pulled her lips back a bit more and closed her eyes again. It was almost too much for me to take. I removed my finger from inside her. She opened her eyes again and looked at me as if she was still trying to figure out my meaning.</p> <p>"I don't think I could take this anymore if you stop." She said.</p> <p>"Well I know that you could but you can't stop until you give me one more chance." She looked around looking for my hand.</p> <p>I sat back and removed my finger from her pussy. She opened her eyes again and smiled at me.</p> <p>"I suppose you want me to take the rest of my clothes off for you." She said looking down at her own breasts.</p> <p>"Oh yes, please. That feels very nice." I said. "Please."</p> <p>She slid her hands down and began to undo the buttons at her skirt. When the last button came free her skirt moved up to her hips. I slid my fingers up her hips to pull it down a few inches. She reached out and began to unbutton my shirt again. I sat back and started to get up.</p> <p>"Wait." She said as she turned around. "I don't want you to do that." She pulled back her skirt before she covered my eyes. "How about we get this over with." She said, and slowly began to pull her wet panties off exposing herself for me. She sat back down on the couch pulling the shirt completely off over her head.</p> <p>She tossed it aside.</p> <p>"Let's see if you can go again." She said as she began to rub her pussy. I stood up and grabbed two of the coffee table to keep myself from falling. I pulled off my shirt and kicked it off. We resumed our slow pace of undressing. I pulled my shirt and pants off and I sat back down on the couch. She took off her panties and tossed them in the pile at my feet. I sat for a minute watching her. Her skin was so soft and the color contrast was even more. She ran her hands over her breasts, and began to massage them. I began to gently unbutton my pants so that when she removed her panties I could return the favor. Her hands moved over her body, down to her sex. She brought two fingers up to her clit and began to slowly circle around it using her thumbâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
