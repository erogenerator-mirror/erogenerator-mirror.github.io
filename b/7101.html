"We'll continue in your bedroom if you like," she said, pointing to the doorway leading to her study. "I'm on my way."</p> <p>I didn't feel like arguing. After the last time I'd had sex that night, it hurt and I didn't want to feel like it again. I wanted to be with her forever. I wanted to stay and be her husband. Instead of trying to have sex with her, I had decided to take what was left of my life up her ass and make her my wife once and for all.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said. "It'll be fine. And you are a good husband." Before I could argue any further, she'd slipped off her shorts and panties and bent over the end of my bed, reaching under the covers with one hand to free herself of her clothing. I couldn't take my eyes off her tits. Her hands were busy, kneading her tits and pinching her erect nipples with her fingers.</p> <p>"Oh God...Oh God...I love it when you touch me, honey," she purred, leaning over the back of the bed to kiss me. Her lips parted and a thin stream of saliva coated my mouth and cheeks.</p> <p>I pulled her to me and gave her a light peck on the cheek.</p> <p>"Honey, you taste so good," I declared, moving my mouth down to run my tongue across her chest and around her nipples. They stood up, hard and long and a perfect heart-shaped brown-furred triangle.</p> <p>I moved to kneel in front of her, where her long legs straddled my hips and I could feel her warmth and her softness against my thighs. As my erection rubbed against her, I heard her purr like an old woman at a song.</p> <p>She reached down to pull my dick down, but I moved her hands away before I could.</p> <p>"Don't hold back on me, honey," she said. "The game's about to start."</p> <p>I pushed my hips forward and she took me into her soft, wet mouth. She sucked me like a small cock, her lips pressing against my pubic hair and pushing back against the base of my cock head. She moaned like a woman possessed as she rubbed her wet fingers against herself, coating them in her saliva. Slowly at first, she took my length deeper into the wet warmth of her mouth until she couldn't, and I could only moan.</p> <p>I lay there enjoying her mouth, which brought my hands to the sides of her head and drew her to me as I plunged more urgently into her. She was moaning constantly now, pushing her hips up to meet me, letting me fuck her mouth even as she sucked me in. She had to look up to know where my eyes were. They seemed to be locked to her face, which was an amazing face to behold.</p> <p>I could feel the tip of my cock pushing into the back of her throat and I saw her eyes rolling back in her head. She wanted me to cum in her mouth, and that was okay with me. I could fuck her mouth forever without losing control.</p> <p>I felt her soft lips wrap themselves around me and her tongue dance across my balls. She had a great ability to deep-throat while my dick fucked its way past the tight and warm opening of her vagina. The sensations intensified and I pulled out to make room for her to breathe and her face was filled with my cock, which she held in her soft mouth.</p> <p>"Cum in my mouth," she said, and I pulled my cock out and she stroked it a few times and then let me cum in her mouth. My cock shot cum into her mouth and across her cheeks and nose. She opened her mouth as wide as she could and showed me my stream of cum.</p> <p>I felt a strange sensation of pride in being the first of my wife's new lovers to ejaculate, but the thought of how lucky I was to have her to look after so much of my business was beyond me.</p> <p>She stroked my cock and my shaft, letting my cum drop down as she sucked my dick head. This was a good way of thanking her for her time and her guidance.</p> <p>I laid on the bed beside her and she wrapped her arm over my neck to pull me to her. She kissed me, tasting the salty sweat of my body, and kissed my chest and stomach.</p> <p>"I love you, honey," she said, smiling down at me.</p> <p>"I love you, too." I replied back, and as always it went against all the right, moral, or otherwise, lines for me to tell her. She was my bride. She was the woman of the house. Who was I kidding? I was the husband of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
