I screamed as I let my load explode into her mouth.</p> <p>"Goooooood," she said with a slurp.</p> <p>"Shit! I'm gonna cum!"</p> <p>"Me too! I'm cumming!"</p> <p>I pulled her up to her feet so that I could kiss her again, and then slipped my cock back into my pants. She turned around to face me, gave a quick kiss and quickly turned again.</p> <p>"Oh my! It was so good, huh?" she asked.</p> <p>"I did too! So fuckin good!" I answered, and then I left her standing there as I put the coffee back before I locked down the front door. As I walked down the hallway, I noticed that she was still standing there with one of her hands on her mouth, and she had already started to run back up to her room.</p> <p>"Shit," I said, and then went back to my room for another round of sex before I went to bed.</p> <p>The next morning, my phone, apparently had rung in the mail. And my next door neighbor asked if she could come over for breakfast that afternoon. I laughed as I answered with just one simple word. "Yah! Be there in ten."</p> <p>After dropping my wife home, I decided to take a shower and just sit in the tub for a while, enjoying the soothing water. As I turned the water off and turned off the taps, I smiled to myself imagining what might have gone on the night before. Thinking of my best friend's wife was definitely a good start to something.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, I was standing in the shower, washing my hair, when I looked through the curtain and saw a very pretty, naked girl standing there in her towel. I was standing under the water for about fifteen minutes before I decided I was about to turn it off. I stepped out of the shower, dried off and dressed myself, putting on my robe and dressing my hair, getting it in place once my hands had dryed on and in a towel. As I was dressing, I looked over at my neighbor's picture on her computer monitor—it was definitely one of the biggest picture frames I had ever seen—and I realized that this could have been taken at a party or at one of my girlfriends' houses. I knew that my best friend would be out most of the day so she probably wouldn't be home until late anyway.</p> <p>Just as I had wondered, my neighbor turned off her computer, but it wasn't long before I heard muffled voices. Curious...and a little impatient...I ran up the stairs a couple of paces and then stopped, peered out the window, and peered back over the railing. She wasn't there. The bed was slightly elevated from the front, but my neighbor must have been still in bed when she got up. I couldn't see any of the interior of the house, which was nice as it was a little early, but what I couldn't see, if anything, was her face in the picture.</p> <p>After about twenty seconds of this curiosity, I got back into the dresser mirror to check the picture in the bathroom mirror, which told me that the two pictures did not match. Well, the picture was still one in the picture and a picture is everything...it had been the image of someone in my wife's underwear. So there was nothing more to know. As for now, it would be a while before I could get to the beach.</p> <p>"Well, that certainly helps," I called down the stairs, "but I'll do something else today. I'm headed down for an afternoon nap."</p> <p>"Why don't you go ahead and start your shopping while my neighbor is out," she said, still obviously in the bedroom.</p> <p>"Oh...sure..."</p> <p>She came down from the bedroom with a bag full of the things that might help me. She came into the bathroom with a glass of scented water, a washcloth, soap, a comb, a razor, a razor and some lube. As she handed them to me, she dropped her towel off of her shoulder and said "I'm going to get my own shower now, and then I'll be back with my purchases." With that, she turned the water off and pulled her towel back on her body. "I'll be on the porch if you want to wait outside," she said, heading into the master bedroom without another word.</p> <p>There was a knock at the patio door and another voice, from upstairs, asking me if everything was okay. The answer of "Yes," sounded somewhat disinterested as my mind began to wander down the list of the items we had both been shopping for. That mystery had been resolved...</p> <p>When I came down a couple of hours later, after I had finished eating my lunch and had been washing up, my hand had been—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
