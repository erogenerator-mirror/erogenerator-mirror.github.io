Not much time, that's for sure, but I thought it was nice nonetheless. I was already feeling a bit antsy and horny, so I just decided to go home, get my things, and then wait for my friend to show up. I was feeling rather well rewarded on a Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>When I got there, I took my stuff into the bathroom and threw out the bathrobe. I then stepped over to the shower head and rinsed off. There wasn't enough water and shampoo to get over really well, so I just washed my hair to rinse off a bit. I quickly rinsed off my hair, as that little piece of filth got in my face. As I washed it, I thought back to that morning. I remembered feeling the effects of the drug again, only this time it was in my asshole instead. As I rinsed off and got out of the tub, I also rubbed my legs up and down for a bit. As I did this, I felt like I needed to be more specific about my next move. A bit of my body went completely limp, however as I went to the shower door, I couldn't help but notice a little bit of blood. I had to laugh a bit...</p> <p>I entered the shower just as the water was finally starting to get warm. After getting in, I started the water. As I got in, I started by going around and rinsing off all the suds. As a little more and more water came out, I could see it get a little darker, and it didn't take long for the water to get really warm. When I was satisfied that I got it all, I went to get some paper towels and started to dry myself slowly. It was nice and easy, even though there was something in the water there again, I thought. When I finished, I was about to go back to the tub when I looked up at the face of my sleeping friend. Now I was thinking of another thing which I can't get rid of, and I wanted to do a bit more than just watch.</p> <p>I had the shower head on to start my drying process, which took about two minutes. As I was doing this, I thought about all this and had been really enjoying it, so it didn't take long for me to fall asleep again. When I woke up, I still had the alarm clock on my bedside table, and was thinking I need to get a fresh start, so I had to hurry and get out of there as fast as I could. As I was out the door, I checked my phone and found that there wasn't really an answer. However, as I got out of the bathroom, I just decided to go take a quick shower first.</p> <p>When I got out of the bathroom, I could see that my nightgown was still on and still on, so I went with it and got a shower really, really quick. I thought I was going to have a hard time with it all, but I guess it wasn't going to have that. In fact, I'm really starting to feel that weird feeling again. This time, I made myself cum, as I thought I had at that moment, because I knew what happened after each session was going to be a big one.</p> <p>As I was still feeling that weird feeling, I also thought about my friend again and wanted to go back to bed, because I knew it would make my friend feel better too. I made sure it didn't cause me any serious problems, and when I got back to bed, I went back to sleep. This time, I did sleep out a bit, but had to start again at 1:30. While still in bed, I wondered about what my time with my friend was going to be likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
