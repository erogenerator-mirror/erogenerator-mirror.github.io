But I needed to go and see if I could control the situation. I was sure that if I went to one of the shops that the three of them would come to know all the facts. I could make this one thing out to start with and not have to make a repeat for my friends. I also needed to establish a good relationship with the two of them. Maybe that would have been my choice. After that I had some things to accomplish before I had to face the other girls.</p> <p>I checked myself in the mirror again and was pleased to see that I was still pretty nice looking for my age. But I didn't really like the way I looked. And I knew that if I continued to think that way I'd lose the ability to talk or anything for that matter. I wondered if the twins' friend who I had been seeing for six months would be interested in me as much as I had been interested them.</p> <p>It wasn't too soon after my meeting with the twins that I finally made my decision. I had to take my time and make a few preparations. I was not going to have to face the twins on a day, nor would I have the twins over if it were anyone else other than one of them.</p> <p>I spent my first time in the salon when it was finally time for me to start having fun. Since I was having fun as well, I began to have some fun without the headache that I had had. By lunchtime it became a sort of time-of-day, when I had the time to see a couple of cute guys who really attracted me to all the different ways they could be used to getting off.</p> <p>One of the male assistants brought in a couple of books that I picked up during lunch. I handed them to him. He held them up high against his chest, as if they would tell something interesting to us. After he'd read 'How To Have Better Relationships' he walked me by the wrist to the door and told me to bring them if I wanted to use it. Then he turned to the twins who seemed to be already in a hurry so he told them that I would go and talk to them. They didn't even look too surprised at what the other person had told him.</p> <p>After that there were more things to have done while I waited. Once I got done that I made it a point to talk to the twins. I asked them what they had been doing for their birthday. They were about to tell their friends the truth about how they started seeing someone else and it seemed they hadn't told me about what they had been doing. It seemed they had been doing that to keep that feeling of guilt out of their mind and their sex lives were a lot more normal than they had been.</p> <p>One of the things they had shared with their families was what they would do when they got back home and what they would do when they got back home if they could stay there for a while. I also talked to their mother about going back for a visit. I had to ask her not to tell her parents about their relationship that she was still in with her son but it was best never mention it again. At the last minute, she was also going to tell her parents about them seeing someone else that she had never been able to share that with.</p> <p>It would be better for me to have time to do that before they returned home.</p> <p>The only way I could get rid of them would be to tell them that I had the job the twins had left me and that they were to move to one of the dorms down the block.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>Things seemed to improve after that.</p> <p>The third day of my work that morning went very well. They even called me over to the twins' dorm room to have lunch and talk. Apparently they had planned to go to dinner there anyway and they really were having fun. I wondered if the twins went to this big one and whether I could get away in time with them. It was so obvious that I was still a little in shock about the situation. I asked the twins what they were up to when they got back home.</p> <p>"We just finished up some shopping," Traci told me. "It's going to be a while until Mom gets home."</p> <p>I wasn't about to put on a show for the twins, especially Traci. I still had a job to do since we would have to get back in time to have dinner ready. The twins seemed determined to get dressed up for a night out and get whatever they wanted. As a matter of fact, they already had a date for it. It was a Friday night at the restaurant and they wanted to be ready for it.</p> <p>After dinner, they wanted to go over the plans with me. It was a little awkward at first because it was a little awkward having themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
