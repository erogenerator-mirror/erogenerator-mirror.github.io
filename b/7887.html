"And, it's all yours!" I pulled up my boxers, and then kissed her again. The heat of the kiss made us both moan in anticipation.</p> <p>Breaking apart from the kiss, she slid away and put her hands in her lap, rubbing herself, and sighed.</p> <p>"Oh, my...I love how you do that," she said softly.</p> <p>"What makes you say that?" I smiled.</p> <p>"Because you're so big!" she giggled. "God, you are huge!"</p> <p>"And hard as stone!" I added. "But now that I've seen you, I know you're the one for me."</p> <p>She chuckled and slipped in beside me on the couch, rubbing her hand up and down my thigh.</p> <p>"Well, if you're that big and I want you that bad..."</p> <p>We both giggled but I pulled her in to kiss her again, and I felt her hands travel up and down my body.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," I said, kissing her again, "and you know it."</p> <p>"But now...this is my boyfriend..." she started, "You've seen me naked?"</p> <p>I nodded and looked into her amazing green eyes. "I wish you'd said something!"</p> <p>"I want to see it so bad, though..."</p> <p>"You're lying!" she laughed. "Can I?"</p> <p>"Haha, you want to, don't you?"</p> <p>"I sure do!" she squealed, and then gave me one more kiss with her tongue. "It wouldn't be too much," she added, pulling her clothes down.</p> <p>"Let me show you," I said as she turned around, and we hugged, our wet tongues intertwined. I could feel the wetness in her body as our wet bodies caressed and rubbed each other.</p> <p>Finally she broke the kiss and said with a grin, "I love it when you do that!" and she jumped on the couch, flipping through a magazine.</p> <p>"Show me more!" I said as I pulled her towards the couch, and we kissed again, my right hand gliding up and down her silky smooth thigh.</p> <p>She lifted her ass to me and I got in between her legs, rubbing my fingers in the crease and up between her legs...</p> <p>"OH!" she cried and giggled.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around me and kissed my face, neck and ears, murmuring that I was so good at this.</p> <p>"I love playing with you," I said, pulling back.</p> <p>"Oh, god, I love that, oh my god," She kissed the side of my mouth and neck. "Now, you can do what you want with my body."</p> <p>She rubbed her legs together and squeezed my cock in her hand.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked.</p> <p>"If you want me to!"</p> <p>"I want you to!" she laughed.</p> <p>"Oh, I will!" I agreed.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want to cum inside me?" she asked again.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked, concerned.</p> <p>"Well, it's very early in the morning, and as soon as I wake up, you'll be like this," she said with a shrug, and pulled her feet towards her, opening her thighs and grabbing the bed sheet.</p> <p>She smiled at me and put her head in her hands and looked at me with those gorgeous eyes of hers. She was smiling back at me, so I leaned over her, and kissed her deeply before grabbing the edge of the bed sheet, yanking it up and over her, and she spread her legs on top of mine.</p> <p>She was so warm, she was so beautiful, I loved it! I put my hands on her thighs and pulled her towards me.</p> <p>"It's okay," she whispered, kissing my lips again. "I just want to feel. I want to feel yours against me..."</p> <p>"You can feel mine," I told her and kissed her on the forehead again.</p> <p>"And I want to feel your body against mine," she continued, "if my boyfriend is sleeping in the spare room."</p> <p>"Do you want me to get you naked?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she said.</p> <p>Her body was so beautiful, from her hairless pussy to the taut lips of her sex.
