When they got in their car, they went and kissed. She reached over and he took the glass he was holding up and put it on the dresser. Then she put the glass on the bed and went to get their towels and washcloths.</p> <p>When he returned, he looked at her with a questioning look. "What happened?"</p> <p>"I was horny. Did we have a problem in the kitchen?"</p> <p>Tom stopped walking to answer her. "No, my god, this is unbelievable. I've never been in a situation like this before. It is fantastic."</p> <p>He was lying but it felt good to just lie in her arms and relax. "I can't believe we did this. I can't believe I have been so stupid. I don't think I'll ever take you back."</p> <p>"I've been waiting so long for this that I was never able to keep myself away. I told you I loved you Tom, and I want to be with you every moment of every day." She kissed him again and he did the same. They held each other for a long time. The feeling was incredible, but they made no rush or any sense of urgency. They were still in the moment until the sun kissed her skin and set.</p> <p>"Do you know what day you are moving into your new home, Tom?"</p> <p>He shook his head. "I don't know how to say this. My life has changed so much, and it is so scary. I haven't been in the same place as when I was with them. It's unreal."</p> <p>She walked over to him and put her arms around him. "Let me go get you a towel and we can start all over again." He followed her to the bathroom where she turned on the warm water and held the mirror over it, then looked at the room. "I love it. It is so different from my old house."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>She took a deep breath. "I love it. It's been great being in the same room as my ex-lover, and the way this house looks." She got the soap and was running it down the front, washing his skin before she began to scrub his chest and his lower torso. Tom felt his body flush. She was making love to him under her own water. He pulled back and looked under her to see a smile playing across her face. "Is this what you want? Will you keep holding me like this for the rest of your life?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes."</p> <p>She ran her soapy hands over his chest. Her other hand was touching his stomach before it moved to his erection. Her fingers moved easily over him and she moved them up and found his glans and ran her fingers over the head. A shudder passed through her.</p> <p>"Please, just do it."</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>"I want you inside me. Please take me and fuck me."</p> <p>She didn't hesitate this time. He grabbed her and pulled her up. He held her tightly as his penis slipped between her thighs to enter her. Their coupling lasted long into the shower. With trembling thighs they turned the setting off the water and kissed. Their bodies pressed together and he felt her pussy pulsate around him as she cried with ecstasy. He kissed her head while he pushed inside her. He loved the feel of their skin as they began to move together.</p> <p>The shower felt fantastic; it was like the last night they had spent apart. It was different from the night in their old house. She reached down as he pushed in and she pushed her head into his shoulder as he moved up and down over her body. Their mouths devoured each other with a passion that she hadn't known about and that she was beginning to understand. Their mouths moved over each other. Each time he pushed up on his arms and his penis moved out of her, she would lick her lips. Their kiss became more ardent as he pushed in hard. As she pulled his face toward hers, he moved back until just his tip remained and pulled her body into his penis. She felt his penis rubbing her and she moaned for it to end.</p> <p>The tension melted as their bodies moved over each other. The kiss deepened as they moved together. Her legs held his body tightly against hers and his weight rested on her. All her skin against his was electrifying and she could feel his hot breath. They kissed like this for several minutes until finally he could take no more and began to move inside her.</p> <p>In the darkness, she reached down and held his bottom cheeks. It was his first and it still felt great to have it in her. They stayed still as he thrust his hips deep inside her, pushing them against her.
