He was feeling really light-headed and he smiled at her. Her eyes looked a little sad so he said "I'm afraid that I had more than my fair share of things to say about you when I brought it out of my mouth last night. I was about to speak when I saw your face again just like yesterday," she nodded. "But I had never quite heard what you were looking at the other day. And you said something about 'maybe I could talk your brains out this weekend, you bastard'. Well, I'm glad that I didn't listen to it, and I'm glad I told you what I've been trying to say all along."</p> <p>"Why?" he asked.</p> <p>"I didn't think this was the time, or place, to start," she replied as she took a sip of her wine, looking him straight in the eye.</p> <p>"Well, if I hadn't been busy with my business you wouldn't have bothered with me right now," he lied.</p> <p>"It's true that I didn't do much about it, that's all," he told her.</p> <p>"And I didn't know that a man like you would ever ask a woman to make love to him," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"Well, I have to say that you are very attractive," he said.</p> <p>"You think so?" she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I've heard women, both married and single, come all over guys, but I never thought one would ever consider trying it with one of my buddies, especially after the way you were acting. I mean, I don't know why I'd want to, but I think that would be a lot fun for me."</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you asked," she replied.</p> <p>"Well, I can't wait to get started again next month. I'm going to be gone all week long, and we can finish up as we see it. If you want, I'd like to get together with you again one other time."</p> <p>"If you go out tonight after you get back from work, you don't need to do anything," she told him.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure I know just the right place," he replied, smiling to himself again with her.</p> <p>"If you really like playing with them, we won't try to convince you to join us again sometime," she smiled at him as they sat back, sipping their wine.</p> <p>"I'm only trying to make it up to you," he said as he reached behind his neck and undid his collar. "I'd love to see what you're hiding under there."</p> <p>As he stood she stood up and she looked at his face. His eyes were dark brown, and he was standing there with his shirt open, revealing a magnificent chest.</p> <p>She sat down on the bed, her back to him as she leaned back.</p> <p>"I'm sorry that I came out here with that," she sighed.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to be," he replied looking at her.</p> <p>"I know," she replied as her voice lowered in, reaching out to touch his face.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed her passionately, as his hands reached over her, under her tank top, feeling her firm, shapely chest and feeling her nipple harden at his touch.</p> <p>When they broke away she said, "Well, we better clean up after this," as she reached out for his shirt.</p> <p>"That might be an improvement," he said.</p> <p>"Yes it does," she said, taking his shirt from him and tossing it over on the bed.</p> <p>"No, I think I'd better take off those glasses," she said to him as she reached behind her to unzip her skirt.</p> <p>"Oh, that," he asked her with a smile. "But I don't think you want your glasses cleaned up again?"</p> <p>In a very matter-of-fact way, she said, "I do have one more thing though," and pulled his shirt from him.</p> <p>"Ah, yes we will have to get some more glasses," he said as he helped her remove her glasses.</p> <p>As she tossed her glasses into the bedside table, looking in his eyes, she reached up and took his shirt from him. As it fell to the floor, she smiled down at him, reached up and helped him undress.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she said with a sly grin, as his boxers were soon followed by his jeans.</p> <p>"Well, at least you have something to hide," he said as he pulled her toward him, her hands holding his as she slipped from his arms.</p> <p>"Do I look good in these?" she asked as his hands went around her waist and pulled her close, beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
