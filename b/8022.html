I was trembling.</p> <p>"Go on," she murmured as she slid her fingernails up my arm as she led me to the bed. She pushed me down and crawled up on top of me, kissing my lips hard. Her tongue slid into my mouth and my arms circled her neck. She kissed her way down my neck to my chest. I felt her tongue circling my nipples. She reached out and unbuttoned my shirt, slid it off my shoulders, and finally let it drop. She gently ran her fingers over my chest as she kissed her way down my abs. Her tongue darted between my lower legs, then up again, and again under the fabric covering me. She moved down and ran her finger up the lips, wetting my skin.</p> <p>"Mmm baby," she whispered as she wrapped her lips around me, "I've wanted to taste that for years. You taste so good." She gently sucked me in and out, her nose nestled in the patch of hair just above my crotch. She teased the tip with her tongue and slowly slid it up and down, coating it before sliding it into me and moving it around. I could feel her tongue and breath moving around me before she opened her mouth and began to suck my shaft. I moaned as her lips slid up and down on me. She released her grip and began to run her hand slowly up my balls, then back down and around to my ass, pushing her fingers in. She started to rub and kneed me with her fingers as her mouth slid up and down on me.</p> <p>"Put your arms down," she sighed, "Just rest," she said as she pushed me away, leaving me lying on my back. I heard her walk up to the head board and her shoes. She crawled up atop me and began to straddle me. I could feel her damp pussy rubbing against my cock, as I felt her legs open as she began to sit on me.</p> <p>I reached around to cup her ass and her pussy as she began to slide up and down on my shaft. The feel of her body on me made my cock ache and it felt the perfect fit. She moved her body up, allowing my cock to slide up her, her tits rubbing against me as she slid her cunt up and down on me.</p> <p>"Mmyeah," she sighed as my shaft filled her, "It feels so good! I love your cock." Her body quivered as I moved my hips slowly up and down while she rocked her cunt up and down on me. We began to move harder, our hips slapping together as our breathing became ragged. She began to moan, "Oh god! Oh god I want you! I want you to cum..." She began to shake and began to moan louder and louder as pleasure began to build in her.</p> <p>She moaned as my eyes rolled into the back of my head as an orgasm ripped through her body. "Hnnnnggh. I'm cumming! Cumming!" she cried out as her juices covered the head of my cock. Her whole body shook and she ground down hard on me. I kept pumping into her, her juices coating my cock in every spot she could reach, my hands gripping her ass and pulling her down onto me as my head moved in and out of her.</p> <p>"God!" she moaned as I moved my hips gently back and forth still moving in and out of her. Her body shook as she came again. Each wave came stronger than the last. Her muscles clenched around me with each wave, each wave.</p> <p>When she'd had enough, she pulled herself off of me and I could see tears in her eyes. I reached out and held her and kissed the top of her head as she ran her hands through my hair. I pulled my shirt on, feeling her body as it cooled. We held each other for as long as we could before we broke off our kiss.</p> <p>"Did I do it?" she asked, smiling as she wiped her eyes.</p> <p>"No." I said, smiling back, "I wanted to. We did something nice."</p> <p>"You did!" she replied, "I should have felt better when I got home."</p> <p>"Oh you did. We're all going to need rest." I said as we kissed and hugged each other again.</p> <p>We kissed some more, and I felt her hand slip down my belly. She was sliding the tips of her nails lightly up and down my cock, which was now as rigid as it's ever been in my life. Her finger touched my cock as she slowly began to slowly jack me off. I moaned and her nails traced the length of my shaft, running down the side and upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
