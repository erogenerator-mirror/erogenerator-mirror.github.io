"I guess we just need to be honest about who you're with."</p> <p>"Well, it'll be ok," he said. We walked up to my front door. I felt as if my body, as if it was on an electric wire, were on it's downward journey. As soon as my house got dark, the back of my skirt was sliding up my back. I knew I should have stopped it, but I knew that feeling of needing to feel his hands on me. It made me want to want him more. I didn't want the feeling to be over, but if I just stopped him I would be more than a little disappointed, but I guess not. We broke for the front door and walked out into the night.</p> <p>The house was very nice. Not like the stuff at the college of any normal house. It's a bit nicer than my room. The décor is very contemporary and has a touch understated elegance that I hadn't anticipated in a while. The fireplace and mantle are all a work of art. "The place is beautiful," I said.</p> <p>There wasn't even any television playing, and there wasn't even any sound. The house is very modern and elegant. One wouldn't think we were still in the days before computers and TVs with a hard drive. We walked past the living room to the side. The carpet wasn't the same as I remembered from my previous years here in my house. But there was something there. A note, probably a short note or "Hey you," and some pictures. I wasn't sure what it was, but I would know it before I even knew where it was. I couldn't help but feel like I had been a part of the memory of what I have here. I couldn't take any more and I was already feeling guilty about it.</p> <p>We finished our meal without saying a word. We didn't say anything about who ever had that feeling on our bodies. We walked back to the kitchen and I knew what I wanted to do. I turned to see if she was back on the street. She wasn't there. I quickly looked around my house, and then I looked at my son's house. It was the same as it was last year. Still it was nicer than I had imagined.</p> <p>I sat on the couch. I could feel the warmth of my house coming into contact with the thin material of my house coat. My hair was still wet from the dryer. I could feel the sweat pouring from my face and I looked forward to the summer. I didn't say anything. Nothing was going to change our lives. Nothing would change our relationship. Nothing would get me a place to live and to love. Nothing was to be spoken about again.</p> <p>I was alone in my own home. I took off my coat and laid it on the chair. I felt a rush of freedom when I started to feel my body. I removed my clothes and lay naked on my bed. I didn't put on panties. Just my bra and panties. It was as if I didn't have to. I felt exposed to my own son, and it brought back all those memories I had of my first husband. I felt so comfortable with him there.</p> <p>I wanted him. I needed him. But not for the first time. I wasn't sure that would be enough and this time I was determined to prove them wrong. This time when he started to feel me up, he wanted nothing more than to feel that. I wanted him to feel that. I wanted him to know I had wanted this but didn't want it. I wanted him to know he had to stop. Not just with me, but with both of us. "I want it," I told him. "I want it so bad I wish I could feel the same way about him."</p> <p>So his answer was "Just as I am right now about your mom. It's obvious. It's not like you are seeing each other every day or anything."</p> <p>I told him. "Well, what is it? I'm not seeing him or anything?"</p> <p>"Sure, I guess you can touch me."</p> <p>I moved to touch his bare chest, but he stopped me.</p> <p>He said, "It's ok. Touch me, and be real respectful of me."</p> <p>I didn't know how to respond. I was afraid to touch his chest because of what I was feeling. I didn't want to make any kind of decision. I wanted him to do as was asked but I didn't think I would get him that hard. I wanted him to be aroused, to feel something he didn't understand. He didn't ask. He wanted to. I wasn't sure if I was ready to give that up now.</p> <p>"I guess I should be honest," I said at last.
