There was no question our “talk” was over for the weekend.</p> <p>We went for a walk to the pool. We talked about the work schedule. And, I could tell by her smile and easy manner she had a “totally great job” that the two of us would be working until the weekend had come. There is no denying that there will never be a weekend like that.</p> <p>I’m sure we had time for an “alternative” weekend during the week.</p> <p>Once again, we got an hourglass view of the pool deck. But that’s another story.</p> <p>The sun had just climbed over the edge of the pool deck and we got out to cool off. All of a sudden, we could see two other swim trucks moving towards the deep end of the pool. This must have been our “talk”.</p> <p>My mind started racing. Did we ever tell people we had just been fucked? Did the “talk” ever come to the fore? What did this “talk” even mean.</p> <p>My mind was racing again. A million thoughts went through my young body at the same time. The more I wrestled with the answers the more I was becoming frightened.</p> <p>I tried to imagine what an inter-office “talk” could really be.</p> <p>I saw in my mind a group of couples standing in the shallow end of a swim pool. I pictured a woman on her hands and knees in the water. A man knelt by her head and sucked her pussy. His cock was in her mouth, a hard cock, and it was deep from behind. I could feel the wetness of her mouth on my penis.</p> <p>The thoughts just kept coming to me. This was all one-way.</p> <p>I was ready to explode. My penis was hard and straining with the desire to penetrate the walls of my body and explode in a hot, intense orgasm</p> <p>The thought of getting my hands around her mouth and cock while I ejaculated in her mouth made the blood drain from my mind.</p> <p>I could still see on the other side of the pool deck a couple of male swim trucks as they got out of the swimming pool, their erect cocks pointing straight out in front of them.</p> <p>I began to wonder about where they were headed with their lives. I knew it would be in one of the many “talkers” of the pool. And, if I did what they had planned for me, a huge number of people from the swim trucks would be fucking me in my naked body.</p> <p>I tried to picture the scene. I imagined a group of men entering the pool. They would all strip, and climb out of the pool and get ready for sexual action.</p> <p>I had to get back in the pool. I knew that I couldn’t do it. I walked over to the pool side of my old friend and pulled my shorts on, pulled my T-shirt on and started back around the far end of the pool. Then, I heard a car come up the drive to the house.</p> <p>I quickly put my shorts back on. I did not look at the gate, and could see nothing out of the ordinary. I slowly walked down the lane to the pool house.</p> <p>The front door was not locked, but the key was at a tiny key pad. I just knew I had to open it.</p> <p>I went to the other side of the pool, turned on the lights, locked it from the inside, and entered the house. I walked to the door and looked in. To my surprise, there was a long, thin black dangle resting between two of the black-clad thighs. My heart stopped beating and my body tingled from the shock. I turned on the lights.</p> <p>I stood close to the black dangle for several seconds and listened to the sounds of people at work, voices and voices in work. In that space between two of the great openings in the ceiling of the house, I could just make out a woman in her office walking with an older man she had just left. Their voices were muffled, but the man’s head appeared to be in the office, as she had been talking at the other end of the room.</p> <p>She had her hand between her legs. Slowly, she pulled the black dangle from between her legs and slid a wet finger into her pussy. The man must have been watching her walk, as the woman behind the desk came to the door. The man was now sitting on the edge of her desk, with a cock in one hand, and a woman’s head in his lap.</p> <p>I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
