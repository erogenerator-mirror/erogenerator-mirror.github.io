We can't go on waiting here!"</p> <p>"We're not having an out of this! We'll drive all the way to get to the airport and just sit in your car for a little bit... I'll go get the luggage, we'll go to that plane, and maybe get a quick flight home."</p> <p>"Nonsense! You look as if you're going to jump out of there right now!" He pushed her roughly to her feet and grabbed her under the arms. "And go make your arrangements for a flight ticket! I told you!"</p> <p>Her head was spinning and she was shaking uncontrollably.</p> <p>"Why are you holding me here?"</p> <p>"There is no use holding anything back. You're mine!"</p> <p>She looked back down, her eyes full of tears.</p> <p>"It wasn't my choice. If you want me to stop... it's alright, I'll stop. I just don't want to cause you..."</p> <p>"Shut up. I can feel you. I didn't give you my permission to go on doing this, it wasn't your choice."</p> <p>"But you said, 'Let's go for a ride!'"</p> <p>"But you don't give in, but I'm afraid we might be getting in a lot of trouble here..."</p> <p>"Nope, we're just going for a little ride."</p> <p>Dana stood in front of him, her eyes downcast in a moment.</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"Just for a little ride, like last time. I am not asking you to leave, not for anything. And I know you won't leave me; you wouldn't tell me if you didn't want to be with me."</p> <p>Dana turned away from him and ran to the counter with her luggage.</p> <p>She found the flight ticket, a blue suitcase, along with her overnight bag.</p> <p>"Now let's get you out of here! And you, you know where to take the bags? Or I can carry them here."</p> <p>"No, I want to take the bags!" She kicked him in the shin, hard! She got his back in the door.</p> <p>He was right behind her "What's the problem, baby? I'll take a limousine, get you home, and let you have it back in time to help your Dad. Then you can carry it on your back. We're on a business trip!"</p> <p>"You mean you don't have to pick me up, get me to pick you up on the way to the airport, and have your car taken home?"</p> <p>"It wouldn't matter. The limo will bring an end to our arrangement and there is no need for me to be involved. It's the least you can do for me."</p> <p>"No! I'm serious! I'll take you with me anywhere you want to go!" she got to trying not to laugh as she got a bit of a squeal out of him.</p> <p>"Let me grab a bag, I will take you back to your hotel, and we can make our flight and return to our hotel without any trouble. I don't think it is too late."</p> <p>"Can you leave it where I can pick it up for you as quickly as I need it?"</p> <p>"If we don't leave right now; I'll call and tell my Dad I will be late."</p> <p>She went to the front door and waited for him to reach down to grab the keys from the little pile of bags and go to the airport to pick them up. It would be a short ride to their airport and he wouldn't have to walk back to their hotel without a rental car.</p> <p>The limo arrived and they were in front of the hotel as soon as their luggage was in the cab. They stepped straight up into the hotel as soon as they got into the limo. It was a beautiful room, as much as a hotel or a vacation suite would be. There were four beds in the room and they had a full bathroom off the suite.</p> <p>When the limo pulled up at the hotel, it was time for both to strip and get ready for their day together with only a few minutes to spare. Their suitcase was heavy as they got out of the limo. Dana took the bags to the suite and put them in the guest room where they would be staying for the next several months.</p> <p>That night they shared a lovely dinner with their families, had a good movie they had made up, and then got home around 7:30 AM.</p> <p>Once they were back home, they were both exhausted; they had just decided toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
