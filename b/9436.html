A minute later, my phone began to vibrate at my side.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hey, Chris, are you ready to start dinner? I'd love to catch up with you later in the kitchen."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure. I'd like that, too. What's yours?"</p> <p>"I'm ready now." We hung up the phone and I couldn't get a word in edgewise. I started to take off my shirt as we made our way into the kitchen. I was wearing boxer shorts under my pants. I pulled them down the back and then off. I quickly took off my shirt and tossed it on top of my clothes. It took me several minutes to get my shirt down and my pants on. I was naked from the waist up though; as much as I was going to make a move, I didn't want to risk being seen wearing a piece of myself. I turned on some music, found some paper towels, and cleaned down my dick. I picked up my bottle of baby oil and began to wash more of the cold substance in. I could only imagine what that stuff had in mind for me as I soaped up my entire body.</p> <p>My dick was already getting hard. I began to jerk it, using my left hand to steady myself. After some moments of stroking, I was so turned on I could feel it rising, waiting to be released from its prison.</p> <p>"Chris," I said out loud.</p> <p>I couldn't hear her answer but could hear her breathing, so I figured I might as well. She turned around to see me watching her, and I saw her give me a knowing smile. She moved back on the couch, bent over the arm, and waited for my next move.</p> <p>I had one of my hands on the cushioning of the chair. My other hand grabbed a handful of fabric and ran it over her hips and the curve of her ass. I felt the lightest brush of denim as it dragged across her. Her ass was incredible! It jiggled delightfully in my hand. And where my fingers felt more hair, the skin of her upper back was a darker shade of red. I felt it ripple, as if I were a part of the body, as if my fingers were the same as hers – the same part. I wondered if she wanted me too? But, if I wanted her that way, how would the feeling of her skin and my flesh change?</p> <p>I slid my hands back over her hips. I heard her squirm. She made a strange little noise. I could feel her skin underneath my hands. Her skin and my hands are what I'd imagine would be her best feature. I imagined how it would feel to touch her there. I felt my cock twitch, but I couldn't take my eyes off her. The lightest brush of my fingers felt like a feather across her cheeks.</p> <p>She leaned over the armrest of the couch, putting her forearms on the floor, her legs apart, and her back straight and her head up. Her eyes focused on mine. I continued brushing her ass with my hands. My hands slowly slid up, over her shoulders, down her back. She moved her head to the side, as she felt my hand slide lower.</p> <p>I continued to move closer and closer to her, not taking my eyes off her. I saw my head, but couldn't get it close enough to look into her eyes. The contrast between her dark-brown, and dark brown skin was incredibly erotic. I watched her, feeling my cock grow in my hand. What would I expect from her to do when this went down, at least without me wanting to do anything. Her eyes weren't quite as big as my own. But, they seemed to know.</p> <p>I heard the phone ringing loudly and quickly jumped down off the couch. I wrapped my hands around each other, pulling us toward each other and kissing her neck gently. She broke the kiss first, and looked up at me with half-closed eyes.</p> <p>"You have a lot of time today, sis. You should get some rest," I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>She nodded, and I thought she'd probably go to work the next morning, but she hadn't. She reached up and lightly patted my cheek.</p> <p>"Come back sometime," she said softly. "And try to relax. I'm sure you'll be okay soon, and I'm so glad to have you back."</p> <p>And with that, I followed her out of the kitchen. After all the excitement of the day, I had a feeling that I would never be the same again. There had never been a day that felt like this. I felt so empty, but I wondered if I could survive. I turned onto my stomach, then wrapped one arm around my waist, and used the—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
