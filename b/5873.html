"You're only two days old and you're still the same, you know that! You know all of those things! I'm the queen and I'll rule in a joust!"</p> <p>"You can't do that!" Marie stood up, but there wasn't any point in going, the king wasn't going anywhere. She had done as she was told. He had done it even better than she had. The question was, could she just stop? Her knees were starting to buckle and her heart began to pound when he finally turned to look at her, a little more sharply than before. She swallowed hard, her mind racing.</p> <p>"It's all right," he hissed. "Just go. It's just...just...let me keep away!" he insisted. "I'm not going to marry your baby," he added quickly, his eyes burning into her.</p> <p>"You...can't!" she cried, but the idea scared her and it really hurt, causing her to shake her head, tears dripping down her face. For a moment her mind felt numb to all the feelings at once and it was a moment before she was able to breathe again. She took several deep gasps for air and then she ran to the door as fast as her shaky legs would carry her. He hadn't made it; she could feel his muscles tense and quiver as he turned. She closed the door quietly and slammed it behind her, cursing herself for letting this happen.</p> <p>She was alone with herself again, and just as quickly, there was an answering call. She hung up and stared at the wall as if it had a voice, for it had told her that she could make the call, and yet she couldn't even think of how to get in touch with the man who would be living with him.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and thought back to her last night with the royal consort and remembered how the two of them had had sex.</p> <p>"Was it good?" she wondered aloud, she had had no clue that she had been making love to her master.</p> <p>"I...wasn't expecting you to be here," he told her.</p> <p>"I came to say thank you for letting my son live with you," she said quietly.</p> <p>"It's not that, Marie," he murmured. "It's just that you must have known what he was like. It's not every day you get to see your lover in your arms."</p> <p>"A moment." She took a deep breath, and then sighed heavily. "I guess so, my love..." she told herself.</p> <p>"A moment," he agreed, and he smiled gently. When he heard her open the door he stood. "Come on, beautiful," he murmured softly and she took on the same nervousness that she had felt before.</p> <p>"I...uh..." her voice trailed off.</p> <p>"Come, my love," he whispered her name.</p> <p>Marie felt her eyes widen as he walked through the door. She had just met him, and she had known it would be wrong, so she stood dumbstruck, her stomach in knots.</p> <p>"But..." she stammered, "but you're not so much older as much as I am."</p> <p>As Marie felt her lips draw in and close, she remembered the conversation he had with her in her bedroom when Kieran had come to live with her. He had assured her as much in that moment he would stay with her and that she should come to him willingly, he didn't want to lose his father. And Marie had seen him, he had seen her come to see him. She had heard him say he would return with the prince or something.</p> <p>How could she believe him?</p> <p>She walked up to him slowly, taking his hand and placing it on her thigh, holding onto it gently as all the other moments of their time together became blurred by the time her fingers found his. "Why are you here?" she asked him slowly.</p> <p>"We are here to talk, my love." He held back his own laughter, and Marie was in deep, confused thoughts of just how she had expected her life to turn out this way. She looked down at the floor and felt the tears start to stream down her cheeks.</p> <p>When he looked at her and saw her sitting on his bed, he held back for a moment, and he was so pleased with himself that he hadn't actually broken her. But the fact that he could have stopped this was a blessing in disguise. They had both wanted it and he had taken his time and been patient enough to give it to them both. But she wasn't like that, at least partially anyway. She had to wait until she got her master back before she could begin to look like her when he made love to her in thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
