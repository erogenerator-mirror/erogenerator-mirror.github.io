I took a nice drink of water and sat down on the edge of the grass. I looked over at my wife, she was leaning back against a tree and her legs were dangling down across the grass. She had a little blonde landing strip.</p> <p>"Do you like my little pink landing strip?"</p> <p>"Hell yeah, baby, it looks so pretty."</p> <p>I got up and walked towards her. She was leaning her head back, my hand reaching towards the landing where her blonde landing strip left a cute curve up in the middle of her thigh. I reached right up to the top of her landing strip, and I could smell her perfume.</p> <p>"Damn girl, you're so turned on."</p> <p>"I think I'm more than turned on."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>I moved towards her, and placed one arm around her shoulders, and the other one around her waist. I held her in my arms from behind her and pressed my chest and abdomen right up against her. I was very aware of my hard dick pressing into her, so I didn't want to spoil the atmosphere by going too fast so we could get caught. I pressed my body tight against her back and reached around her, and started to finger her pussy.</p> <p>"I like that. You've just got so much hair."</p> <p>"You're not even right for me. You really don't think I'm really pretty for a man?"</p> <p>"Well baby, I've always thought I knew what a pretty girl looked like before I came along."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess. I love it that you're not a woman. I have to admit, you are so much prettier than you look." She said as we continued to kiss.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm glad. I really like it that you like my hair. I do just fine for a girl."</p> <p>"Baby, look at me."</p> <p>"Don't I look great?"</p> <p>"Of course you do baby. You just look so awesome."</p> <p>"I'm not just sexy honey. That hair would look great on you, too. You look beautiful with it on. And I bet if you weren't so pretty, you wouldn't look so good with it all the time."</p> <p>"What would I look like without it, baby?"</p> <p>"Oh, you know, just about everything honey, and then some."</p> <p>"I'm serious!"</p> <p>"Just go with it. Let's see, you're just the right size for any of the women in the world."</p> <p>"Really, I'm sure I could do with some of that."</p> <p>"You're right."</p> <p>We continued to kiss and touch each other's bodies. My hands started to stray southward, down her back. I didn't want to go too slow, and so I pulled her ass towards me as my hands moved up and down her back again. I continued to kiss her from her toes to her neck and kissed around her ear. She stopped kissing me as she grabbed my wrists and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"You know something...I do smell you from behind. I like that."</p> <p>"That's a first for me."</p> <p>"I know. I like to know there's a little extra in it."</p> <p>"Oh, you don't have a lot of hair there, are you really sure?"</p> <p>"Only a little. I've never had a problem finding a landing strip that doesn't just turn on on and off."</p> <p>"No, not even for the most adventurous. I like them all trimmed. The look is so interesting. It's so nice...the way it's like someone is touching the end on a little flower."</p> <p>"Okay baby, you might need to shave my legs. I don't trim too much, you know," she said as she looked down at my waist, "but I guess that there isn't much to worry about."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll go along with that."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>I moved back into my chair and said, "Hey, why don't you let me give you a back rub?"</p> <p>"You wanna come over here?"</p> <p>"You mean if you do that?"</p> <p>"Just try it. I'm kind of ticked out with that."</p> <p>"Okay. What are you doing?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm just giving you my back rub...or at least a back rub."</p> <p>"No, just a sit down for a minute," she replied as she took off her top and sat back down on her lounger, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
