It was a soft, romantic and sentimental song with a slow sensual beat. Daddy was out somewhere and I looked around the room as it was my own bedroom. There was a large bed covered in satin, and a low table with a glass of wine in the center. There was a CD player in the other room. I smiled as I took the CD from my father's hand. I had been listening for the last hour and a half and I was so horny, I had no intention of falling asleep.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" Daddy asked as he looked at me. I could feel my face blush as I could not hide my nervousness. He nodded at me gently.</p> <p>"You look...different," he said, looking into my eyes. For a moment, I saw a little bit of the same shadow from before, but now I could tell that my father truly loved me.</p> <p>"I know," I said. "I wish I wasn't so nervous about this because I am sure I will never get the chance again. Daddy, I'm sorry but if it makes you feel better that you don't want to hear this anymore, I am happy that it wasn't your fault that I had to do this. I guess I know I shouldn't have pushed it a bit," I assured him.</p> <p>'But...what are we going to do now?' I thought to myself as I held my breath. I wanted to say everything I needed to, but I didn't. I had to put it past them, or they would be no help to me.</p> <p>Daddy was not the type of man to spend too much of his time hanging out on the town or having a great time. I had heard what he talked about in their town to begin with and I had been shocked in his reaction to the songs, but the music had changed. It had made me feel much better about life.</p> <p>His eyes slowly closed as he relaxed in the chair. I couldn't help but admire his soft white skin under the black material. It had a slight glow as it moved back and forth across his tan skin. As my eyes traced the curves of his body and I remembered my thoughts following the movement across his back, I realized it was his hands that made me wet inside. He was so handsome. I reached with both hands and touched their soft white hair. They were so soft, so warm...but... I held back a moan as my hands moved in tiny circular motions up and down his chest. I didn't think he could feel it in me, but it was as if I was still in high school and the sensation was new to me.</p> <p>"Are there anything I can do to help you pass out?" He asked. I nodded. He pulled up the bedspread to reveal a few pillows and reached into his chest bag retrieving a couple of tissues from the bottom drawer of his nightstand. My father's body was different than mine from his. He was not overly muscular, or maybe it was that much that made his body so different. His body was defined and smooth, and he had a strong build.</p> <p>"No... not a thing," I said. He smiled. "I think you would be much better if you were in bed with me." I smiled. He was right. I had to, I couldn't.</p> <p>"I am sorry, Sweetheart. That was not something I expected from you. I would love to keep you in bed with me, but it would be wrong," he softly stated.</p> <p>I stood and moved around the bed to where my father stood next to a large metal bar. My father reached out and touched the bar, placing a black cloth over the top.</p> <p>"We need you to kneel in this," the rough metal demanded from my father. I hesitated. I had never been put on such a low enough level in the bedroom before. My father had made it clear in an instant that it was only to be used on me, not him. He was pleased with that. If he couldn't have me tonight, he had to have me at some point in the future.</p> <p>He placed both his hands on the bar of one end of the metal bar and the other on my shoulders. I felt his fingers pressing into the soft material as he slowly pushed the material down. It made me feel as though he wanted me to be more naked, but it helped me to stay composed. I knew that as I moved in his presence, all would be forgiven. His fingers moved as slowly and deeply as they could and I almost believed he was a lover. His skin felt silky against mine and it gave me goosebumps. I could hear my Daddy softly moaning as heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
