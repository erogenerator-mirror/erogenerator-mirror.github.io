I mean, it's a long time since I've been with anyone, but right now..." She looked down then back up at me, "I can't believe how much of this has hurt. I mean not... but... I don't want it to ruin anyone else's night. "</p> <p>I was silent again, but when Molly shook her head "NO! Don't tell me you've got feelings for Matt... because then your relationship will be ruined...and your friends will take offense that it did you a favour."</p> <p>"Why would I do that? I'm the same guy you fell in love with and you think there's some way you can get back with me." I asked her.</p> <p>She looked to the kitchen clock and saw it read 1:32 A.M. That meant that Matt would wake up at 7:00 a.m. and she knew he would probably wake up at 8:00 a.m. But she still looked shocked. "Honey, what's going to happen? It wasn't like me. I..."</p> <p>"But...." I started but Molly cut me off.</p> <p>"Yes, well let's just say Matt has needs that need him tonight is about to become a regular event. We both need to relax and take it slow, because we both know what goes on behind our back. "</p> <p>Molly leaned over a bit to kiss me "Okay... you know what you're going to do? Get me some food to go down stairs..."</p> <p>I nodded, "Sure... what would you want me to bring? "</p> <p>"Well, we both want a nice healthy breakfast right now..."</p> <p>"No, that's okay. Let me get my jacket." I stood up and pulled us over to the kitchen counter. I opened the fridge, got out some hot towels and spread them up on the counter. I opened the door to the kitchen, made some phone calls, and set up a couple of things into the trash so Matt could get to bed. I then pulled on my jacket and gloves from the bottom drawer and started to turn the handle.</p> <p>Molly had taken off her jacket and was laying it next to the counter. She looked at me confused at what I was thinking. I was trying to read her mind and she tried to back away. I saw the fear in her face and said "Molly honey, please don't worry. I'll just do what you need," and I walked over to her and put my left arm around her, resting my hand on her knee.</p> <p>The look on my face was priceless because her expression immediately changed as if she had changed the subject completely. I saw the lust in her eyes as she turned her head to look at me. Without a word, I let my hand slide up her leg to her lap and gently pulled it away. Molly was still struggling to keep her composure so I reached over and let my hand graze her crotch. It turned out to be exactly what she was after, a response to what I had been going through over the past week to get to this point in her life right at that moment. She reached out and put her hands over mine and looked down to where my hand was now resting on her lap, as if she was trying to get a hold of it, and then let go and put her hands over mine.</p> <p>I sat there a moment, watching as she looked back to Matt for a reaction, all concern on her face. She looked nervous but there was only excitement in that I couldn't place. I slowly ran my hand up her leg, getting closer to her pussy until I had two fingers in her and I curled them slightly before putting one hand back on top of it. She let out a gasp as my hand moved up towards her clit and I gave that nub a small push to let her know that I was still on the edge. She was still having trouble staying focused on what I was doing to her and she let out a moan. I pulled my fingers out and brought them over to my mouth and licked them.</p> <p>Molly's eyes got big and she took a quick breath. Her eyes widened as she looked down at me with a surprised look, and then she just stared at the floor for a few seconds. I brought my fingers back to her mouth and she opened it wide enough for me to lick her juices as it ran down the back of my fingers. Then I put them in my mouth, not wanting to waste any of her juices but wanting to feel her mouth as it was. When she was all the way down my fingers I put that hand up to her mouth and she started sucking them until she had a mouthful of my juices. She seemed to be a little drunk, but she just seemed to enjoyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
