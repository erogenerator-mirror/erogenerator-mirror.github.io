She looked over to where John's phone was blinking. She glanced at the display. It had an image of her, the one on the screen which appeared to be the first image they had taken of her naked. "Here, put it on."</p> <p>"What? How?" John laughed. He was getting more and more excited but his erection was so big that it was difficult to keep one hand on it. "Are you okay? Is it all right?"</p> <p>"I think I'm okay," Susan said. She stared at John's cock as though she wanted to get a closer look. She took up the image of him sliding his fingers up and down the shaft, taking her time for him to make the first move, making him take the lead. "I think so. Where'd you get it, anyway?" she asked once more.</p> <p>"It was my dad," John said, not liking the way she was flirting. He was a little unnerved by her, which was understandable, since it was obvious that she was attracted to him. He'd had sex with many of his classmates with whom he'd been married. He was young and his experience was limited, but Susan was something he'd never gotten his wife to do. At least that had been a small part of it.</p> <p>Susan looked at John's cock a moment, which made her smile wider. She took up a position on the seat on opposite sides of her in front, placing a hand on top of her breast once her hand was touching him. "Oh, God," she said, a little embarrassed. She had wanted to do it again, but she didn't. "No, wait," Susan said, pulling John to her. "I don't want to do it too fast or anything."</p> <p>He looked back, not at her breast but at her face. She was looking back at him, a little worried, a little frightened but not as bad as she'd felt.</p> <p>"So," John asked. "So, do you want to take off your clothes again?"</p> <p>"I'm okay with it, anyway. How about it?" she asked.</p> <p>"Okay, sure," he said. "What do you want to drink?"</p> <p>Susan grinned. "I thought we could try a rum and cay, I'm a little drunk. I don't have many of those in me."</p> <p>He smiled back. "I could use some help, too." It was a lie, of course, but it was better not to have to go through with it. "Maybe a glass of vodka, too?"</p> <p>Susan grinned. "A glass of water would be nice." She stood, turning her back toward him. "Are you going to be okay with taking off your shirt?" she asked, as the buttons on the front of her sweater began to unzip.</p> <p>"Sure," John said, his body still a little stiff from his erections. He reached around Susan's waist and helped her to her feet, a little unsteady on her feet. "How about something to drink?"</p> <p>"There's a little rum in there," Susan said. They both reached in her jacket to find the bottle on the small table in her living room. The rum in the bottle was ice cold.</p> <p>They each took a drink. The rum was light and tasted very good. They were almost finished with the drinks when something caught their attention. It was a bottle of wine and a small bottle of some kind of liquid.</p> <p>They reached for it but Susan stopped them. "Let's get some more," she said, holding onto the first glass.</p> <p>"All three of us?" John asked.</p> <p>"I guess so," she said. Susan had the bottle held out toward him.</p> <p>"I think you can do with a bit more than three," Susan said, taking a sip. "You get a little more." When she took it over to John, she almost choked. She had never had any trouble getting some of John's wine before but she didn't want to be chaperoned. She was too young and inexperienced to do anything but try it.</p> <p>John picked the bottle up and took some more of it and opened it. They both took theirs and tipped it to their faces. Susan laughed and handed him the bottle.</p> <p>"You've got a nice touch," John said, taking the bottle from her. He tilted the bottle up toward him and placed it between their lips. They quickly parted and their tongues met for the first time. John let the bottle fall toward her hand. He moved his other hand from her neck back to her breast and felt her nipple under the fabric of her sweater. His cock wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
