"I'm kind of scared to be like that."</p> <p>"I'm sure you'll be fine," I assured her. "You'll love it. Relax, there's no one I know that can't tell you what to do and who to tell. And I know you'll be very loving when I get there."</p> <p>She smiled and nodded. She wasn't smiling or smiling like it might be hard to imagine. "I'll be more than fine," she assured me. "I want you to fuck me every way there is, and I mean every fucking way."</p> <p>I wasn't quite sure how to respond to that. I felt like an idiot.</p> <p>We got out of the pool, and I held her at the door while she went upstairs to change. She asked if there was anything else I wanted to do to her.</p> <p>"Do you want to take the pictures?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'd like to do that," she said.</p> <p>"Okay, that's fine," I assured her. "But I want to do it right."</p> <p>She smiled, stepped into her bathing suit, and headed back up.</p> <p>We'd had enough hot sun and the pool wasn't what it usually was in early spring. I was already up when she came up, wearing her suit the same as the other day, so I got her a glass of wine and took some pictures. I was surprised when she came back into the room. She was sitting on the edge of the bed on her stomach, leaning back against the bed. Her hands were resting on her lap, and her legs were parted. Her top had slipped down almost below her breasts when she had turned her back to me, and I think I'd gone too far to change my mind.</p> <p>"I thought you might want to take some more pictures?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, as she pointed to some picture taken earlier that day. "I'd like to do more, I've got some time before we start again."</p> <p>"It's okay with me," I assured her.</p> <p>"I know you're going to fuck me," she said. "You always said I was too innocent, and now I'm going to prove that right."</p> <p>She looked as though she was about to say something else, but then got quiet.</p> <p>"I want you to kiss my butt," she added.</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed. It made me smile.</p> <p>I leaned her down on the bed and kissed her all the way down her spine. I could smell her skin, but it was definitely her sweat that was on her skin.</p> <p>"That feels good," she said. "Now I want you to taste me."</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed.</p> <p>I kissed my way back up her butt cheek, but this time started slowly and worked towards her hole, kissing and licking and sucking. I could feel her body starting to shake when I touched her, and she didn't stop me from playing there.</p> <p>"That's it, that's a good girl," she moaned. "Just kiss the hole and play with my hole for awhile."</p> <p>I did, and as I did, she squirmed, but didn't try to cover her ass at all, just letting me play.</p> <p>"Don't tease me, kiss my asshole," her voice was almost a whisper. "Oh my God, you are so sweet," she finally cried. "I don't know how I got so wet when you're licking my pussy."</p> <p>"You can tell by my cock when I fuck you," I joked.</p> <p>She laughed. "Don't you want to taste me so bad?"</p> <p>"I want to taste your pussy too," I answered.</p> <p>I kissed and nibbled my way back down her ass crack, and then moved my hands back toward her pussy. Once there, I started kissing and licking again, starting from her right knee, working my way down her thigh. As I did, her legs parted wider, and I got to her pink slit. I ran my tongue up and down her lips and she groaned when I flicked my tongue right on her clit.</p> <p>She was right, it was going to be a slow, sweet, but good orgasm. I got her right off that bed and onto her feet before she even realized I was standing. I had stopped licking her hole, and was just getting her legs to wrap around me while she was up on her knees again.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid," I assured her. "Once you've gotten me hard, just keep licking my balls."</p> <p>With that, she started sucking me, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
