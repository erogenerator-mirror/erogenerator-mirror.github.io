I'd rather do you than a guy like us, at least not yet."</p> <p>She pushed him back and climbed up. "We already thought of that." She began taking off his clothes.</p> <p>He pulled down another blanket. It was thick enough that they wouldn't need any of the padding, but the blanket had been tied in place. A bit of padding around his head, his neck, the side of his face, the corner of his mouth, down the side of his chin. He also had a blindfold.</p> <p>"Hey!" His voice cracked. "What's for supper?"</p> <p>Her face fell. "Wanna do something?" She climbed into the bed.</p> <p>"Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess." He said before he pulled the covers over himself, then pulled her face toward his until they were both asleep.</p> <p>-------------------------------------</p> <p>Waking up, the first thing he noticed was her head near his chest. The smell of soap, of dried soap, of dew, was still there. It was the same scent that he had smelled when they were playing, and now his eyes were wide open, so wide that he couldn't focus on it.</p> <p>"Good morning." She whispered into his ear.</p> <p>His eyes focused, and then he saw her smiling down at him. And there was only a trace of a smile this time. Her breasts pressed against his chest. Her arms went round his body, hugging him.</p> <p>He closed his eyes, and started to reach out a hand, but she turned his hand. When she felt his fingers, they were already stiff.</p> <p>"I want to have this with you," she whispered in his ear. "With the way we're already here."</p> <p>He felt his cock swelling as a thought struck him. "W-What about us?" He wasn't even certain how he felt about seeing her in her nightgown. In fact, he was not sure if he might be able to take her at all. He just knew he wanted desperately to see her naked, feel the silk that ran up her thigh and around to hug her thighs, to feel her hips roll and her breasts pressed against his chest. But his first instinct was to cover his head from the wind, and hide.</p> <p>As he turned toward her, she was on her back, her arms still wrapped about his shoulders. "How about in bed?"</p> <p>He nodded. "Yeah."</p> <p>"No, on your back," she said simply. "I want your arms out of the way."</p> <p>He did, the way she had wanted his fingers to. He felt a little of her morning excitement as she lifted herself toward him. The feel of her breasts against his chest was more exhilarating than the sight of the naked goddess who was on him. And just like last night, his desire, desire that could not wait for the day, to be free of the constraints of a man, to submit to this temptress.</p> <p>He heard her start to moan a little, her soft moans vibrating against his skin. He put his arms out from his sides to hold her up and felt his cock pressing against her leg. He turned the pillows toward him, and saw that they had also been turned back. He knew she had had a hand down there.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" he heard her ask him as his lips brushed hers.</p> <p>"W-watching," he answered, his voice quavering. "What? Do you want me to watch?"</p> <p>He shook his head.</p> <p>"We are playing with ourselves, you know. Masturbating like mad."</p> <p>She giggled.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Not even if you were on your back. If you moved to your side, I'll do it."</p> <p>"No. Not even if the other one was on her back."</p> <p>"I don't care, Baby," she whispered in the way he had never heard a woman say before.</p> <p>His hand went to the inside of her arm, and he touched the silk to her other arm as well.</p> <p>As he continued to feel her upper arm, they both knew, with some trepidation, that they had gone too far. But it had been a few minutes, and she had already been up to something, his body, his cock, all of it. She had gotten him aroused enough to make him want to take that next step. He was afraid she would tell him no if he asked.</p> <p>He felt her hand snake inside his thigh, and she slid back to his body. Their legs were touching. He felt her fingertips against his balls as he held her breasts in his hands.</p> <p>He felt as if he should stop, but he couldn't.
