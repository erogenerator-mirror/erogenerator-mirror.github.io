He asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied, breathlessly. "I feel so weak right now."</p> <p>"That's because you're like my best friend now," I said, putting my arms around her from behind and pulling her back against my shoulder.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she whispered. "I feel like a big sister. Someone I can turn into my girlfriend anytime."</p> <p>"No, you're not," I said. "You don't have one."</p> <p>Her response was to raise her right arm up, hooking the back of one hand behind me and gently caressing my shoulder. "Do you like me?" she repeated, with a giddiness that I could barely suppress.</p> <p>"I love you!" I assured her.</p> <p>"I'm feeling so good," she murmured into my ear, "and, I don't care if I feel awkward right now. The feel of your arms is so nice."</p> <p>The next thing I felt was a warm pair of legs and a pair of breasts pressed to my back. My dick jumped a little. And then, when the other one turned and pressed against me, I felt her leg rubbing me as her arm moved to my ass. "Mmmmmmm," she breathed against my cheek. "Someone's feeling my ass."</p> <p>I moved a little closer. My arm around her back and around to the front to feel it. I was rewarded with a sigh. She was moving, too, one of her arms moving up her chest, and the other arm coming up to grab my knee. I moved a little further, and then pushed it against her flat stomach.</p> <p>"Hmm," she hummed. "Don't I have the greatest legs?" And then, her legs slipped a little more around me as she slid back a little, and her hand drifted around to grasp my dick, which I felt, but the sensation was so erotic and naughty. I moved my hand around her leg, which she seemed to enjoy it more, which brought a smile to my face.</p> <p>"How about you?" I asked.</p> <p>"I guess." She murmured.</p> <p>"You can tell me about it," I said, looking in her eyes. When she did, I leaned forward to kiss her, and her face moved to me, where she put her lips to my ear and softly said, "You're all mine, little brother."</p> <p>I was surprised. I have no idea why she would say that with me. At the time, I didn't think it was so. But now, she took over the game and the game we had chosen. Our little games. And I had nothing to complain about.</p> <p>We lay together for almost an hour, just looking at each other and playing with our fingers as we touched skin. No awkwardness in it. I could feel her breath on my neck and the warmth of her body, and her hand moved up and down my leg as she stroked my dick. I closed my eyes, and the feel of her hand on my skin aroused me so much that I almost felt as if I had peed when I looked at my sister. I could have had this moment with her all night.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum," I moaned, holding out for as long as I could. "God, baby. That feels good."</p> <p>"Shhh," she hushed me. "You were telling the truth."</p> <p>"I was," I said. "I was telling the truth about everything. About how much I loved the feel of you when we were together. About how much I enjoyed the kiss. About how we made love."</p> <p>"That's sweet," she murmured. "That's absolutely right for us both."</p> <p>I rolled back on top and grabbed her waist between us. "I want you to feel how much I love you."</p> <p>"And how big," she asked.</p> <p>"Just about," I added. "How I love you."</p> <p>She kissed me again, and her hips moved against me. Then, a little later, she stopped and said, "I love you too." I could tell she was surprised, but I wasn't sure if she felt upset or turned on. "It's wrong," I said. "I shouldn't have—I shouldn't be doing this."</p> <p>"You just have to," she insisted.</p> <p>"I know it's wrong, but—I don't want to do it again."</p> <p>"Me either, but—"</p> <p>"But I want you to," I insisted.</p> <p>"Can we—maybe we can start over?" she asked, and that was the moment of truth.</p> <p>Her hips moved on me for a long time, and then she whispered, "I want to make love again. Tonight. I need to make love again for a long—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
