We can't do that." he said as he pulled her to him.</p> <p>"It's late." she said weakly as he let her go.</p> <p>He got up and turned to her, "Don't worry there's a first time for everything." he said as he kissed her on the lips.</p> <p>As they got out of the limousine they saw the cab coming out of the hotel bar, so they went inside to wait for it. They walked into the bar knowing what was going to happen, so they went to a table and ordered a drink. As they sat down, they exchanged small talk as the cab left. As the cab pulled away, they walked outside and went to the valet. "Thank you for the ride." he said to the driver, as he held his arm out towards her.</p> <p>"Thank you. I'm really looking forward to the next adventure with you." she said as he extended his arm to her.</p> <p>"You're welcome." he said as he got a card to go with the cab.</p> <p>"So that's my name is my card is yours." he said as he took her hand and gave it a quick squeeze.</p> <p>"Thank you very much. You're really kind to me." she said looking up into his eyes.</p> <p>"Yes, it's very nice to meet you." he said as he extended his arm back to her.</p> <p>"See you later." she said as she reached into his pocket and took out his card; as she smiled she saw a black envelope on the dashboard under the driver's seat. "My name is Sarah."</p> <p>"Sarah. Nice to meet you, too." she said as she shook it out slowly. As the door closed behind them she looked in his eyes and knew that she was falling for him. She smiled and thought to herself, "I love the thought of having a man in bed with me. Thank you so much for being so kind to me. Thanks for talking to me. I'm going to miss you so much...please stay." She said as she let go of his arm and walked down the sidewalk to the curb. She felt as though she were falling in love.</p> <p>As they walked back to the building she went to the elevator, he followed her and got in. They went up to the third floor and walked quickly to the door, as they went in the bedroom. As he walked up to the door that led to the bedroom they got into bed. As she laid on her back on the other side of him, he snuggled close to her, his body snuggled into hers. Their arms wrapped around each other and as his lips found hers, they kissed passionately, their tongues dueling.</p> <p>As they broke their kiss, Sarah moved her lips down to his neck, as her fingers moved along his chest, down his abdomen. She then moved her lips to his nipple, flicking her tongue against the sensitive area. She sucked it into her mouth, as the hand that had been caressing his ass began to slowly slide into his opening. Her hand slid along his shaft, as her fingers slowly slid up and down in the wetness of his shaft. She removed her mouth briefly from his nipple and kissed her way back to his lips as her hand continued to stroke his cock.</p> <p>She moved over to his cock, and took it into her hand and moved into his body and back up, as their mouths met in a deep kiss. As she kissed him, she took his cock into her mouth. As she did so she pulled her head up and moved her tongue over the tip. As she took his cock into her mouth her lips closed around it, as she moved his member in and out of her mouth. As his hips moved to match hers she moved her hand from his balls and began to fondle them, as her tongue moved from his nipple to the base of his cock, and back again, as her hand continued to move up and down his cock, she made him moan.</p> <p>They had always done this before, as their passions grew with love, and lust. Now that their passion had started to rise, as their hunger grew there was nothing to stop them, as the passion between them began to take over. She released his cock from her mouth and slowly moved her mouth down his body. She moved to the left of his body once again, as slowly she moved down his body, kissing her way up his body, as she moved to the right. She stopped just at eye level with his hard cock, as his body arched toward her. As he was fully erect Sarah slowly moved her tongue down towards his balls and then back up to the head. She then wrapped her lips around the tip of his cock and moved her tongue along the length of his shaft.
