I'm the one that's going to fuck you, and I know you are going too."</p> <p>She took off up the stairs, not looking back or turning to us until she was out the door. The look in her eyes was as if she was about to tear right through us all and make an even bigger mess. When she opened the door, I just turned and looked at the two of us as she reached out.</p> <p>"I can't take this shit," I thought. "Why can't I take a chance, and trust me, I don't want to take the chance. It's so hard to make fun of you with guys like that, when they're acting like they did to each other all the time.</p> <p>But I wanted her to take her bra and get the door, not hurt herself just to show it off to all the guys. "It was just a question. I don't want to see anyone hurt," I said as I walked to her.</p> <p>"Hey, I'm not here for that."</p> <p>"No, you're not," I said, as I reached for her. "You want that bra, and nothing else?" When she put her arms around me and pulled me closer, I was amazed that I was able to stay in this position for so long.</p> <p>"I know that all those guys want to see my tits. They want to see my nipples."</p> <p>"You know this is what I hate. It makes me jealous," I said. "What's wrong with getting your own breast from men? You know you want to be touched and fucked." She laughed and pulled me down again, until our lips were almost touching.</p> <p>"Fuck you, you asshole. Who wants to know what I want?"</p> <p>"Don't act so self-conscience," I said. "Let's get inside." I pulled her to me and she let me go. We pulled the bed out of the way, and with the sheet covering us, we lay down. "Get on you back," I said, "and I'll take your pants and shoes off."</p> <p>She did too, and got back in. She pulled her shirt off, leaving herself in only her panties. I took off my pants, and laid down between those huge, glorious thighs that I'd been dying to touch and fuck. As she looked up at me, I watched as she stroked her pussy. I watched as she spread her thighs open, and looked at me from between her legs. I watched as she leaned down and started to lick her pussy. I thought of being on my back under her and watching from a chair in that basement with her, but then I remembered what I'd been working on, and I pulled her face into me and started to moan as she ate me. I'd done it before with a guy a few times, after all. It never went all that far, at least not with me. But the look in her eyes when she started to lick my pussy, and then sucking hard on my clit, it was all pure, raw, animal. I was coming hard and fast, and she quickly followed as she was swallowing my juices.</p> <p>We both lay there for a few moments, when I asked her, "Where were we?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she said, "We were just getting caught up in it. I don't even have a phone or anything to call home to see you."</p> <p>I leaned over and pushed one of her legs over mine. "I guess I'll just have to come back."</p> <p>"There's the phone, and there's the car," she added, pulling up her panties and sliding her pants back on, "You'll stay a while longer." She laid there with her legs spread for a few minutes, then she got up, reached into her purse, got a big towel, and cleaned as much as she could off of her legs.</p> <p>When I got back down near the foot of the bed, I had her turn over and lay under the sheet which she had been carrying. I looked at her and noticed that she had a big, white towel covering her ass, but I knew there was nothing at all she could do about her panties.</p> <p>She started by saying, "What am I thinking about doing? I'm already fucking him and he's waiting his turn with me, and I have no intention of going back." I took a breath, then said, "I'm going to turn this up the other way."</p> <p>She started to look over at that phone on the side table. "You have something up your ass there, don't you?"</p> <p>She looked over at me and mumbled, "Not muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
