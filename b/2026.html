I joked with her.</p> <p>"That sounds like a very good idea" she said with a smile, making me chuckle again.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, baby," I replied, running my finger down her cheek. "I just figured we could play around for a bit, and see what happens."</p> <p>"You better not," she said nervously.</p> <p>She looked back over her shoulder and just laughed, giving me an impulsive grin and giving me a wink.</p> <p>She gave me a quick kiss on the butt and made her way toward her room. I just followed right after her. She closed and locked her door before she even turned around and locked her door.</p> <p>I stood there and stared at her, stunned from what had just happened. I felt my heart pounding in my chest in a way the only rational part of my body had ever felt, but at the same time I couldn't think of a place to be any more. My eyes scanned every inch of her body, taking in every curve that I could, all the way down to her feet, her toes. My mind was on fire as I stood in her room, and when she suddenly walked up to me, her face was still a little flushed, but I felt better than I had in a long while.</p> <p>"Do you have anything on under there?" she asked after she leaned over to push the door open, letting her breasts brush against my chest.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied and tried to smile for some reason. "It's just a little something to take your mind off," I added.</p> <p>"Oh," she said coyly.</p> <p>I ran my hands up her arms and up her shoulders, feeling the soft skin under my fingers.</p> <p>"I could go for a cup of coffee and go grab a quick run around town," I thought to myself, then I realized I was just going to take a short shower in that bath. "That would be awesome," I added, thinking to myself this might not be so bad after all.</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed me, grabbing my cock and balls just once before she sat on the sink. I sat down and watched her, feeling her warm body pressed up against me just for an instant, our breath mingling as our lips met. She put her feet up on the sink as she leaned in as I leaned in and kissed her all over. As I did, I noticed she slowly took off her jacket and blouse. I quickly got my shirt off as she threw it over by my feet, and she let her hands roam down to her breasts, rubbing them through the bra.</p> <p>I slowly leaned in and kissed her on the lips, and she eagerly returned the kisses. I could feel her fingers softly play over my chest as the fabric separated from mine, teasing and teasing my rigid cock as the straps came off and fell from her shoulders.</p> <p>She let out a little moan as she rubbed my chest over her breasts, moaning softly at the feeling of the lace. After a few minutes of that, she slowly lifted her body, letting only one breast out of its bra before she moved her other breast to me, so both together were exposed to me.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she said breathlessly. "You'll have to help me with those first." She leaned forward as I reached up and grabbed the bra strap, slipping it off. It came away with only a slight rustling in my hands, but once she sat up again, the light came on and the light filled her eyes.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, looking at me and smiling a little.</p> <p>"You'll enjoy the surprise," I said, knowing that wouldn't bother me if I could get it too.</p> <p>She just laughed at me and reached into her top, pulling out a small purple bra.</p> <p>"I know," she said and reached under the edge, making out between her breasts, pulling at her nipples as she did so.</p> <p>I moved my hands up to touch her as she cupped her breasts, her arms wrapping around me as she leaned back into me. I could feel my own cock against her leg, and it was all I could do not to pull her right out of my arms.</p> <p>"Let's change the angle?" she asked me, looking down at me, her eyes twinkling.</p> <p>"That would be great," I replied, and I moved away to the other side of the tub, sitting down with her.</p> <p>I took a sip of my coffee while Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
