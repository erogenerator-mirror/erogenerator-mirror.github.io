Don't you want a souvenir. Tell me what you want to tell me?"</p> <p>"I...I'm sorry, John; I just didn't think."</p> <p>I reached over and began to massage her breast through her blouse. The feeling was exquisite. I pulled her bra up and her breast rose from the cup and I felt a new surge of wetness between her legs as she leaned over and rubbed her nipples. She pulled away and grabbed what remained of her skirt and unbuttoned it. Looking into my eyes she dropped the skirt and she was totally naked. She turned and walked to our bathroom and her butt came into me very close the way it had when she had been naked. I pulled the skirt down over it and looked up at her. Her pussy was already wet and the lips were moist.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I just didn't think." The words sounded so corny and so innocent. But she was dripping, and it made me feel so good... I leaned forward and our kissing grew more intense and her tongue snaked into my mouth. The idea that she might be a little nervous with the things we had just done drove me wild with desire. My tongue probed her mouth. She responded and I felt her tongue move in and out. The kiss went on for a short time and I pulled her over to the side of the tub. I turned her on her back. I was on my knees and I began to tongue her. Her body responded and I felt myself get wet. I started to lick up her leg, just where her thigh met her thigh, all the way up to her groin. Then I worked my way upward. I found her pussy and began to suck on her, trying to taste her. I slid a finger into her and pushed two fingers into her and her hips began to buck, pushing her crotch against my face. I slipped a third into her and licked and sucked on her clit. Her hips kept bouncing against my face and I felt my dick get hard again and she was wet inside. Her orgasm came hard, and fast, a hot stream of fluid and fluid that I thought was my own. I wanted to be inside of her, in that moment of passion, but she was on her back, her legs splayed out, and I could feel her cum dripping down on the inside of my pants as I continued to lick her in my orgasm. I slid a second finger into her and felt my thumb press into the roof of her pussy as the wave of her climax overwhelmed her. She felt her pussy walls contract even harder and pull my fingers deeper inside her and I felt her body stiffened. Her hand came down across my stomach and into my pants before she could find her panties. I heard her scream to the sky and felt her body shake from waves of orgasmic pleasure.</p> <p>"Oh, John, I am so sorry...you must think I'm some kind of klutz. I got out of my panties when I came out...they were wet. I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"No, no," I replied as I pushed my pants down. When that orgasm was over she sat up on the edge of our tub and ran both hands through her hair back, feeling its moisture under her fingers. She looked up into my eyes and her eyes were bright with passion. Her tongue came out and licked her lips. She looked at me, then back down at her skirt and said, "Thank you for the fantasy." "That was awesome, Sam. I think we will do something about that..."</p> <p>As I dressed she pulled me into her arms and we kissed again. Our bodies pressed against each other and my dick was still hard. She pulled back and smiled, pulling the belt on her skirt around me. She handed me the shirt she had on and turned to get my shoes and my socks. She slid the shirt up on her leg and then stepped into the shoes while I did the same. We finished off my jeans, zipping them up and I pulled her close. We made our way back into the bedroom and I sat her on the bed and pulled her back on the bed. Our foreheads touched and we kissed very long and passionately. She grabbed my dick and guided it up. I kissed her neck and shoulder. Her hands were caressing my back and neck and shoulders, sliding under my beard again, running her fingers up and down the back of my head. She slid her hands into my hair and I lifted her chin up so we could look at each other through lust-stamped eyes. She looked as if she knew what was coming next.</p> <p>"What are you going to do?" she asked, leaning against me. I just smiled and slipped my hand around her throat and gave her a little tug.</p> <p>"I guess I could just tell you..." I said, and then she moved forward and pulled me to her.
