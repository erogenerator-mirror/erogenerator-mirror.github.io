The pad was of an envelope with five or six entries on it. "If you're wondering, no entries for the next hour. No entry is necessary. Write that."</p> <p>I began writing in the envelope. His name on it was Jeff. His face and body was familiar to me, but there was only one reason for the face on it. The other entries came from a number of other people. He was a real man.</p> <p>When the last entry was completed, he sat down on the desk and began writing. "I hope you're ready for a repeat performance."</p> <p>"I'm more than ready, sir," I said, "I could not have asked for more than what I got!"</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure you could find a new woman as good or as horny as you were, and have an evening that went beyond your wildest dreams! Come and sit next to me. I want to be able to see your beautiful tits as I drive." I leaned over, gave the envelope to him, and sat up on the desk. "Jeff, I have to tell you something, and I want this to be a surprise, and a learning process. So, let's just do what is right."</p> <p>"All right, Miss."</p> <p>"I can't help you, dear. This is really important and personal, and I have to know why you're here. It is what I need, though! I love the idea of having so many beautiful women to love. I can't begin to imagine what other women would do for a man to be this way!"</p> <p>"I'm married!"</p> <p>"I'm sure you have many more women to love, but I'm sure you can find one as special to her as you need. That's why you are here, isn't it?"</p> <p>He stood up. "I'm sorry I said no, ma'am." He returned to the desk and put his hand on my bare back. "Here is the key to unlock you. There's an elevator down the hall. Come with me."</p> <p>He walked towards a door on the corner of the room. "There's a little privacy in here but the door should be unlocked. Get the key, and lock the door."</p> <p>He unlocked the door and walked past me towards the stairs. "Down the hall, in the end." He reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew a slip of paper. It had not been laid out.</p> <p>"There are other keys here, as well." He opened the door for me. I put my hands to the key, turned it, and began the long climb to the top of the stairs. Before I climbed, I bent over the desk and waited for Jeff to unlock the door. I wasn't sure what was going to happen until I heard the locks being turned.</p> <p>Jeff, standing in the doorway, stared at us with a hard-on. "You're coming with me, and getting locked in my office. I'll watch out for you for a bit."</p> <p>Jeff and I entered the room. His office was on the far wall, and as he closed the door, he turned to me. "You are the object of all my passions. You will be punished. I won't be so lenient with you if you disappoint me."</p> <p>My mind raced. Was I really going to do as he asked? Was I really going to walk up to him and offer myself to him, even as a man? How could I do this? How could I have any control over myself if I was not at his disposal? Was I really that kind of person? Had that been my own choice at best?</p> <p>"Please," I said, "if this is some kind of test, you must be punished."</p> <p>"No, it isn't. You were so very willing to let slip some of your secrets to me, then and only this once, that you were ready to give me my reward."</p> <p>He moved to me and I stepped back; a slight pressure on my arms. My heart was racing. A smile formed on his lips as he ran his hands gently along my arms. He brought the thumbs to my arms and began to raise the sleeves of my dress. "If you are going to ask the right questions, we won't be here. Now get those shoes on and do as you're told." He leaned near to my ear, and said, "Go along, Miss."</p> <p>"Will I be punished?"</p> <p>"Yes, Miss." His voice was still low, but above all.</p> <p>I was a bitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
