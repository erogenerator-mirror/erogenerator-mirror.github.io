I've just ... I'm just ..."</p> <p>She kissed me passionately on the lips and then, turning and walking out the door. "I still love you," she told me.</p> <p>"Oh God, that's wonderful," I said, "the last time we were alone was a really special time."</p> <p>Chapter 5: Meeting Mom</p> <p>The meeting with the attorney was at 5:00 sharp, so I was dressed for a good time and when I got there, I was ready. I was seated in a quiet corner of the conference room when a number of men, all with attorneys, walked in. I was seated directly beside them, where my son and mother were sitting. They were all men in their 50s.</p> <p>I'm not completely sure what I was going to say, but I was told that they each wanted to make a statement to me about the case they'd been working on (which was actually a lie). I wanted to make them understand that I had always had a deep, abiding love for my son, that I believed that there was nothing wrong with it (and they were right). I needed to apologize for having let this go on before coming to them and to tell them that I had no knowledge of how it turned out. I had to explain that I'd made the decision that I would no longer work for the company. Now all I wanted was to have my son and mother happy again.</p> <p>So, I told them about everything. In summary, they told me that I made the same mistake of my first day after taking a promotion when I had been assigned to be the case manager on the case. They told me that I didn't have to make any decisions. I had to work in a field where I could make a difference. They told me that they wanted my input, and that I could go back to them in any way that I liked. They had a very strong grip of my future. They were the real men, and I'd been to them for as long as I could remember. They said that if I chose to come back to them, they would not go away but I have always been their friend that I didn't want to leave. It's as if they knew, and they wanted me to follow their lead.</p> <p>The reason for their request was that they were willing to give me an opportunity to come back to them and stay there and keep my mind off the rest. They said that if I chose to come back after a week at their home, they would grant me access to all of their extensive accounts and they would offer me a generous vacation on a permanent basis. There really was no choice, but with all the things I'd been told that I could do on my own, it made sense to me.</p> <p>I was shocked at how easily they could tell me things they already knew, that I'd always known and now I knew why. If I really wanted to change my mind, I'd have to start thinking that I could make a new life, one where I could do the things that I had just done so wonderfully. I was surprised that I wasn't actually starting to do things that, I had wanted to do for the last four months, but I was a little frightened. Now, I knew that a person might get to do things they hadn't done in a long time. I was surprised also that I was willing to go to them when they wanted it.</p> <p>It didn't take them long to agree that it was time to put the plan into action. They wanted me to move in here and try to change the business practices of my company. I felt bad about that, but it was all I could do to keep from crying for them. I had to see that the business was working just as my son had wanted it to and they were going to make it work.</p> <p>I got to the bottom of the business side of the process. I had to start thinking about how to get the business to work while I was there, not just sit around in meetings with my friends or the people who did everything for me so they could get big profits. I just couldn't figure out how to do it without a person like myself finding out. I needed to find someone. I knew that after I graduated and I began running the company, I'd need a new person, someone with a brain as brilliant as mine, to help me put the business side of things, and what I'd gotten into. I needed a new person. I just wasn't sure yet how to start that process. I didn't even know the person that I'd had contact with and I would just have to think about that and decide what to do.</p> <p>A week later, I was in a roomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
