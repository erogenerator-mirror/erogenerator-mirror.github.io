It was very nice to be able to work on this lovely woman's upper body. The hair on her chest, even around her small breasts, was soft but I wasn't really able to see much of them. This was an area that I didn't enjoy enough. Her chest was very round and slightly flattened. While I was working on her upper body, there was still one large part of her body that I wanted to enjoy too.</p> <p>As I got to her mid-section, it was a pleasure to look up her body, to meet her eyes. And it also reminded me of my daughter, sitting next to me.</p> <p>After we'd had our fun, we went back to work. We knew that we couldn't continue with long sessions of sex. We needed something that we could do some much longer so we told her to lay down on our mat.</p> <p>She turned over and lay down, placing her hands on the mat then started taking off her shorts.</p> <p>With no underwear to hold them up, she was naked and vulnerable.</p> <p>I took off my clothes and laid down next to her. I looked down at her beautiful figure and said, "If you can't handle taking care of yourself, I'll just go lay down myself."</p> <p>We both laughed and I lay down next to her. I took each of her hands and put them on my upper body. Then I moved them up to my face as I leaned down and kissed her.</p> <p>After that kiss, we moved on to the next kiss. I held her tightly as we kissed deeply. We knew that we were going to do this several more times.</p> <p>After our mutual kiss, I continued down her body and laid down next to her. While my hands were still on her upper body, I said, "I can't get enough of your body."</p> <p>"That's ok," she replied.</p> <p>I brought one of my hands up between her and my body and caressed her chest. She moaned when my fingers made contact with her nipple. I moved my hand over her breast and rolled the nipple with my fingers. I pinched it and pulled on it gently. She was really enjoying it. "Oh that feels so good," she said. But I knew she was feeling something else.</p> <p>My fingers continued to work under her breast. I moved up and down from her stomach then her stomach and down to her abdomen. And I did the same to her legs, just under her butt. She seemed to be a little impatient about the whole thing, so I went back into the area where I'd left off yesterday.</p> <p>While my fingers had their way with her, my mouth still had hers. My tongue snaked out and teased it like a man would, tasting her sweet juices. I could feel my cock grow even harder. I felt that it wouldn't be a good idea to be so excited and I pulled my mouth away from her.</p> <p>I said, "Honey, I think this is time for a little foreplay."</p> <p>She didn't say a word about her thoughts. Instead of moving her hands behind her she simply spread her legs open for me to get between them. I moved my hands up and down her legs a few times and then moved back down to her thighs. And with a single stroke of my fingers I was on my way to the middle, when she pushed herself onto my fingers.</p> <p>I moved my body lower and started to lick her pussy, gently at first. Then I moved my tongue from side to side and over her clit. This brought an "Oh!" from her.</p> <p>I got the hint and went faster. Her wetness was oozing out of her like water. Her thighs were trembling. I could feel her muscles on my fingers.</p> <p>Then she said, "Oh, that's perfect. That feels so good."</p> <p>"I think you're almost ready," I said. "But I think we're going to have to wait."</p> <p>She took my hand and led me down the line of bodies to the top.</p> <p>It wasn't long in coming. After licking her pussy for a couple of minutes, I moved to the upper surface of her body. I moved over her and kissed her neck. She pushed her hips back and I could feel her excitement. Then she asked, "Are we ready for the real thing?"</p> <p>I thought about what she was asking, "Do me, do me good, make me come."</p> <p>She knew exactly what I meant. "Oh I want that," she said, as she reached for me and pulled me down on top of her.</p> <p>Her fingers had left her nipples. When she felt them poking up, she said, "That's better, I want you to do me good."</p> <p>Her words aroused me further.
