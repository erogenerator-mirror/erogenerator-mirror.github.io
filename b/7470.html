He pushed down the zipper of her dress, gently pushing her hips aside and slipping his arms under her. She gasped as she felt his thick shaft press against her abdomen. He pulled her panties down, along with the last of her dress, and she pushed it and her thong off, leaving her standing naked except for her heels. She looked down at herself, and his cock slipped inside of her.</p> <p>"I can't be doing this, this is wrong," she gasped, but she wanted to feel him inside her.</p> <p>"I thought I could control it for you," he whispered. He drew himself out again, teasing her, stroking her, and she shuddered and came again.</p> <p>"Not like before?" she murmured as he lay down beside her.</p> <p>He groaned softly and began to move slowly in her.</p> <p>"Not like before? You were so wet that you wanted to be fucked again? You must like it."</p> <p>"Did you?" she gasped, biting on her fingernail.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She moved her legs around him, moving as he thrust deeper inside her. He was already harder than she'd ever felt, and she could feel his shaft pressing against her clit with every move, even as he continued.</p> <p>He leaned forward, his mouth just inches from hers. "Take my cock," he whispered.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Take me. Just like you did when I was...I mean, what were you thinking?"</p> <p>Her eyes flew open when he whispered, "You were thinking it was something else." She couldn't believe how loud it was.</p> <p>"I..." she stuttered, trying to form the words.</p> <p>"Do it, I want to," he said.</p> <p>He was just as hard as he'd been the first time, but he'd only just started to use the length of his cock. She stared at his dick, unsure how best to say it. "It's too big," she thought, "but...oh." She was going, "It's alright," but she wanted more.</p> <p>She rolled over, still breathing hard, and began to kiss him, her body quivering. She opened his shirt, pulled it off him, and sucked on his nipples, running her tongue over them and rubbing his cock against her. She wanted him, she didn't care if it was wrong, it was better than her sister. He slid his hands down her sides and pulled her back onto him, her legs wrapped around his. "I'm so wet...I want to feel that inside of me."</p> <p>"You are so sexy when you're like this," he said, stroking his hardness against her, "I don't care if it's wrong."</p> <p>His cock slid inside her and a shiver ran up her legs, then up to her clit. He was hard again, harder than ever before, and she'd never felt so stretched as she did right then.</p> <p>"I've been so full of your cock," she whimpered, "so full."</p> <p>She could feel his hand on her ass, squeezing it gently and it sent shock waves through her. She was so much smaller than she was before; still so incredibly tight.</p> <p>"So so tight, so wet, so soft," he murmured, "Your pussy is my pleasure."</p> <p>"That was so wrong, so wrong," she said as he slowly slid inside her again.</p> <p>He held himself still as her pussy began to tighten around him, her eyes closing in silent pleasure as they held each other. She could feel him hard against her, the length of him stretching her. "What would it feel like to feel everything inside of you, all of your pleasure?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Hm," he grunted, "I don't know," but she could. He had been feeling different all along, and he was going to try to move in and out of her. She felt him pulling gently, and she began to twist a little.</p> <p>"Stop!" she said, but her words stung him and he pulled his cock out of her, the skin sliding along it as she clenched it inside her. She was about to push him back, she felt him move again.</p> <p>"Please," she begged, "please stop."</p> <p>He stroked himself against her and looked up at her. She couldn't believe how hot it felt having him inside her; how incredible it was. "Please, please, I'm still so weak," she whimpered.</p> <p>He pushed himself against her again.
