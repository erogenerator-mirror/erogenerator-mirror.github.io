I enquired as soon as she opened her eyes. "Let's go!" I said. We both went into the back room.</p> <p>The main room was a small dinning room with a huge table set at the back of it. There was also a few tables arranged around each of the large seats along one wall. And there by far the place made my heart race to ask Jenny about what my intentions were. Jenny had not asked about what I expected but she had been quick enough to bring me to the centre of the room and to make sure everything was in order. I sat down on the other side of the table and she sat beside me.</p> <p>"So what do you want to do, and what do we have in store for you tonight?" I turned and kissed her ear.</p> <p>"How about you?" She leaned forward.</p> <p>I put my left hand at the back of her neck and gently pulled her face towards me. I could feel her looking up at me, she didn't take her eyes off me as I lowered them to her lips. She parted them slowly and let her tongue enter my mouth. She was really something else though. I could tell right off the start. I had longed for a bit of a second hand experience of this, a nice soft touch to my mouth. I let go of her neck and moved my hand to cup one of her breasts. God, was that ever comfortable. I had had my fair share of gropes in college and had never expected to be caressed like this. Her nipple was huge and hard and very sensitive. I wanted to touch it, I wanted to gently suck it and feel how deep it throbs and how it swells in my mouth, but all my focus was on that mouth. I gently tugged and toyed with both at the same time and she moaned into my mouth. I brought my one hand up to cup her other breast and gently massaged them, feeling how hard and firm they were. As we pulled away, I had another idea, one that Jenny seemed to have no objection to.</p> <p>"Do you want me to carry on with what we just did?" I asked.</p> <p>"Let's find out" she breathed.</p> <p>With that, I picked her up and walked over to the bed. She sat down on the edge and I slid back on the floor right before her. I knelt by her chair and took her foot in my hand and started to remove her shoes. I took off her shoes and started to kiss her ankle and down to her foot which I gently took between my lips. When I was back to her toes I licked each one and then kissed one of her toes. Jenny didn't object to me doing this. I continued to move around down her other foot in a similar manner. At the same time I brought my teeth to her ankle and slowly nibbled her heel. I knew Jenny wanted me to do this. Her legs spread wider and I could see the glistening of her wetness through her sheer dress. If a moment or two passed before I would have been disappointed to feel it was gone. Jenny's head was back now and her eyes were closed, her lips moving more passionately with every kiss. I could feel her hand brushing my shoulder, I could also feel the gentle swell of her breast. I kept my teeth gently pressed on her foot, still gently playing with her.</p> <p>I raised her foot from the floor to my mouth and kissed along the top, my tongue teasing her arch. But then I stopped there, not wanting to give her the pleasure of licking her instep, but just exploring with my tongue. The taste was really nice. A light tang of saltiness, but there wasn't anything to do so I didn't want to rush it. Jenny had no objection, she just enjoyed being touched, loved it. I kissed her ankle from the back up to her toes, before working my way back down her shapely leg again. She was still laying over the arm of the chair, but she had a different style to it now, a soft up-and-down. Her legs were spread wide and I had a clear view of her neatly trimmed pussy, its moist pink lips opening to invite me in. I gently eased her panties down and moved them over her knees and off. When I got them off her feet she was standing in a different position, her arms above her head. She had a beautiful figure, long and slender with lovely, large breasts. I reached round her and gently pulled her so her back was to the chair and her legs had fallen to the chair edge. Now that she was totally naked I could see that she didn't have a problem having her legs apart. The lips of her pussy were swollen and swollen and ready to be kissed. I stood back and admired her for a while, trying to imagine what madeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
