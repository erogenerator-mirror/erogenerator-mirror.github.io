"Please, I..." I couldn't say it.</p> <p>He pulled my hands down and tied them to the wall. He bent down and lifted on top of me and took my face with his hand, leaning over and kissing me so deeply that I couldn't breath. He pulled up my skirt with a bit of force and exposed my inner thighs. I lifted my legs and he pushed them back and forth in a tight circle, and he started rubbing the tip of his long cock against my pussy. He held the end of his cock in his hand, and I raised my arms above my head, arching my back and begging for him to fuck me so bad. "No," I whispered, and he let my arms drop to my sides, taking the time to kiss me deeply and run his fingers into my wet pussy lips so I wouldn't cum.</p> <p>He pulled one of my hands away and pulled back on my panties. I was about to cum when he pulled his fingers from underneath my panties, and took them between his thick fingers, pushing them into my pussy. I could feel the slickness of my juices on his fingers. I groaned and squirmed. He pushed his fingers in me more, and then pushed them inside of me, and I pushed them out again, trying to get them deeper. He fucked in and out of me, spreading my wetness all over my belly, and he held my hips and drove me towards my orgasm with his body. He lifted himself up on his toes, pushing me towards the wall. I tried to push the hands away because they only hurt, but they only kept me on my toes... He held me back with his arms and my arms, and fucked me with his fingers, slowly, letting me push them out and push my hips back at him, encouraging him to bury his hard cock completely in my wet pussy.</p> <p>I leaned over, and I pushed in his hand. He took my hand, and led me over towards the bed. I was naked by the end of the bed, and he tied my hands to the corners while he sat on the side of the bed on one knee. I watched him undress, all the while listening to the sounds of my pussy grinding against his shorts. I couldn't hear his belt buckle, zipper, or zipper. He took off his shirt, and he tied my arms to the far side of the bed. He stood up and went back to the bed and picked my legs and tied them to the foot. He spread them as far apart as I could get them, tying each ankle to the corner of the bed. He tied my ankles to the other side of the bed, and had me spread eagle on the bed, spread eagled on my back, feet spread apart. He tied my ankles to the other wall of the bed, and I couldn't see his feet. He climbed up the bed and lay against the bed's headboard, and pulled each leg up and hooked them into the footboard and tied them there. He crawled underneath me, grabbed my face and lifted me up off the bed, and kissed me.</p> <p>"You were incredibly beautiful as well as begging, pet," he said.</p> <p>"But I couldn't wait," I whispered.</p> <p>"Too bad. You're so beautiful, pet."</p> <p>"Please, please, touch me."</p> <p>At least he didn't seem to know that I wanted him to touch me. I was so afraid I was going to faint again when he touched me again. He put his finger in my pussy again, and then put two fingers inside me. He used two fingers, sliding them in and out, and pulling them out, and put them in my mouth. "Mmm... I love the taste of your sweet pussy, darling."</p> <p>I was so excited. "But what about my arms." He took my hands and tied them up over my head with one of his belts. He stood, and I could only see the end of the bed and the backs of the pillows, and I could not tell if it was the bed or the bed's headboard. When he was done, I was helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless. I felt so vulnerable, and so excited! My entire body was buzzing and tingling just with the anticipation of what was to come. I could feel the dampness between my legs and smell my own sex in the air.</p> <p>He took off all of his clothes and stood in front of me, naked and towering over me on the bed. He put his arms behind him, and I could feel his body pressed against mine, hard. He kissed me in a deep, sweet kiss, and I melted into it.
