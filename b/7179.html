It was hard to believe.</p> <p>“I’m sorry. Is this your first time?” I blurted something out. “I heard it is something to do with your mother-in-law.”</p> <p>“I told you. I thought it was from your mother-in-law.” You looked away shyly with embarrassment. “How would you feel about it? I told you so many times.”</p> <p>“I love you.” I exclaimed and kissed your ear.</p> <p>“I love you too” you said, smiling. And in that instant your love bloomed to life anew, one of you who was not ashamed nor embarrassed; rather, you’d grown into one of the most beautiful beings on earth. And in that instant, I would have lost all control and I would have been in love with you forever.</p> <p>We both smiled to ourselves as we both realized that there was no turning back. We fell together and the kissing became deeper, sweeter. “God, I can’t believe I’m doing this. Oh my god, I don’t know what to say.” You were kissing my lips, my chin; and my neck. You were nibbling my ear. Your kisses were sending sensations to my body, to my brain; making me hot and making me soooo, sooo horny.</p> <p>“You have a beautiful body. Your tits were so beautiful I wanted to kiss and touch them all the time, but you never came.” You were moving closer to me, to my nipples, which I enjoyed as much as you did.</p> <p>“You’re really a great kisser, Tom.” I smiled at the compliment of your body and kissed your lips even more. You began kissing my neck and then moved on to my chest. You ran your tongue over my breasts to lather them with your saliva.</p> <p>“My bra?” I asked nervously.</p> <p>“No I’m not doing that.” You said. “I was talking to your mother-in-law,” you continued. You moved your hands to my pants and unbuckled the belt. “We can’t use your pants; you’ll see.” I lifted my ass off the seat in anticipation of your lips. “That would be nice.” I said.</p> <p>You smiled, looked me in the eyes and said, “Let us go up to my room. I want to see this, and it will only be fair.” You pulled me to you so that I was lying on the back of the car seat between your legs. But first, you kissed my neck and my chest. Not much, just a light kiss. I felt your lips grazing against mine and I felt that sweet sensation in between my legs that you got with your mouth. It was the best feeling I have ever had. We kissed each other, our tongues exploring, the kissing going on for ten to fifteen minute.</p> <p>I put my hands on your thighs and slowly moved them out from between you and the car seat so that I could caress your legs. “Mmm, that’s it,” you cooed. “You smell so good.” Your hands caressed my thigh and my balls.</p> <p>“You make me feel so good,” you said. “But your mouth is driving me mad.”</p> <p>I had never kissed someone quite this way. Never been one who let go just to enjoy the experience. You kissed my lips very passionately with your mouth opened wide so that your breath could escape. Your lips parted, waiting for me to open my mouth and kiss you with open mouth for eternity.</p> <p>I could not get enough of the kiss; you were so passionate. My tongue explored your mouth in ways I dreamed of doing with you. Finally, the kiss went on for so long that you had little time to anticipate a second or so, because you were still holding my neck in one of the hands of the driver. Your other hand grabbed my hand; but was too heavy for me to do anything about it. I was not willing to be in a position where I did not feel what you felt; and that was in a situation where you did not get a chance to move your lips.</p> <p>We kept our hands moving on each other until you felt me tense; my face contorted and my eyes widened. I lifted my mouth from yours; but you could not see what had brought me to my crescendo; it could easily have been from you touching me; but—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
