She couldn't help the smile that was creeping up her lips.</p> <p>She smiled to herself, "I'll probably never be in the same room with him again."</p> <p>She turned, and took a big bite of bacon, she wasn't hungry.

You know, a bra too?"</p> <p>He shook his head as he picked up his coat and walked toward the door, "Maybe."</p> <p>After her shower, she put on a robe and went down to the lobby, "I'm on the elevator."</p> <p>She saw the elevator on it's way down slowly and followed it.

"You still got my bra?"</p> <p>"I'm sure I could take a look."</p> <p>She grinned, "How do you feel about that?"</p> <p>"You're a total babe."</p> <p>She laughed, "My breasts always are. How about you? Do you think you'd like to see them again?"</p> <p>She knew he liked her big breasts, "Definitely."</p> <p>She grinned, "Thank you."</p> <p>She grabbed her computer and started working on the next day's presentation. She wasn't particularly impressed with anyone else in the class, but she really liked that she wasn't a part of any discussion group. She was also feeling pretty impressed. This was a great year.
