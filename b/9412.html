I said as I got up to take what we call by hand a cigarette.</p> <p>She was already sitting on the chair with her shirt open and her hand stroking her tits and nipples. I took a pack lighter and lit her cigarette.</p> <p>"Don't touch your cigarette till you tell me how you feel."</p> <p>She just smiled at me and closed her eyes, pulled her tit from her shirt, and blew one down the center of her chest.</p> <p>"Damn! You are going to make me cum." She said as she inhaled.</p> <p>"Oh I am." I replied</p> <p>Her eyes opened and she smiled and blew her smoke at me.</p> <p>"Is it better when I do this?" I asked her and she nodded.</p> <p>"Oh you do it." She replied.</p> <p>"Really?" I asked then took another pack lighter and started to light my cigarette.</p> <p>"Yees,” she said as she looked at me and smiled, "that is really good." She leaned back and took another cig.</p> <p>"So are you going to do it again?" I asked as I handed her the lighter and held my lighter to her.</p> <p>"No, I am not going to do it again until you tell me how you feel.</p> <p>"Okay." I responded.</p> <p>I walked over to her and handed her the lighter and took another inhale.</p> <p>"I thought you didn't make them." I said as I took a puff.</p> <p>“I did." She said and blew another smoke up.</p> <p>"Do you want to?" I asked and she just turned to me and looked me up and down.</p> <p>“Go ahead but just take me back to your bed now." She said.</p> <p>“No I’m not going to do it again until you tell me what really feels good and which way feels good and when I feel good or when I'm not good.” I said as I smiled at her.</p> <p>"You mean you didn’t make me cum!"</p> <p>"Yes I did, really right out there to me it really does.” I said as I took another puff.</p> <p>“I do really like the way that feels."</p> <p>"That feels nice too."</p> <p>“Do you cum a lot?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, only when I get right down on my elbows and knees and let it fly."</p> <p>I was so interested in what she was suggesting and that she would do to me, in order for me to cum in her pussy.</p> <p>“My knees are so sore." I said.</p> <p>“They are.” She said as she looked behind. "Let me rub them, they look more like your tits and ass."</p> <p>She took another hit and blew smoke up me to my chest.</p> <p>"Mmm, it feels good to have you here."</p> <p>"Yes it does, and we know you like it."</p> <p>“You did make me cum." I told her and she nodded her head.</p> <p>“Yes, now just let me rub them."</p> <p>I put down my cigarette and took the lighter from her hand. I brought the lighter to her lips.</p> <p>“Kiss it." I asked.</p> <p>"I can’t." She said.</p> <p>“Kiss it and hold it in there between your lips." I asked and she took the lighter and took another inhale.</p> <p>“Kiss it a little bit.” I asked as I moved my thumb toward her lips.</p> <p>She leaned forward and looked up at me as she smiled and kissed me, just a light brushing of her lips against the tip of my thumb.</p> <p>“This is all so nice to see—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
