He kissed her softly on the lips, just barely touching the sides of her mouth. Her eyes were wide with passion as he slowly pulled away, never looking in her eyes. He kissed me with a hunger, one that told me more than words could express. He pulled me closer and laid it full in my lap, his cock pressing hard against my leg. She pulled me against him again, his skin rubbing against mine as our bodies touched. I could not stop looking at her. How was I supposed to go from her to him without crossing the line into a relationship. A relationship as much as mine. I felt it when her lips came in front of my ear and I found myself looking down at the most beautiful face of my life, and when I looked directly into her eyes, there was a look of fear in her eyes. Her mouth moved closer to mine, she closed her eyes and her tongue moved over mine gently. I closed my eyes, my heart starting to race just from those soft lips meeting mine like that. Then my hands moved to her bottom and my hand cupped her as I pulled her to me. Slowly she stood up, her eyes closed as she did her best to regain her composure.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I'm late, but I'm just going to get in trouble again," she said as she stepped out of the bathroom.</p> <p>I opened my mouth to say something, but she stepped close to me and whispered into my ear.</p> <p>"Please don't talk about that." She whispered then turned around to the sink and started running her hands over her face.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I just love your hair" she said as she brushed the hair from her eyes. "And your legs" she added looking up at me. "And, your breasts."</p> <p>I shook my head slowly as I thought about it and nodded.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, I can still feel them" I sighed. "I love them when I kiss them and look at them. I love the contrast, the contrast of your soft skin and soft hair. But you're not going to tell me anything about your body yet."</p> <p>She turned around and kissed me, not the gentle, gentle kiss on the mouth, but a sweet, warm, lingering kiss. She looked into my eyes and saw what she just said. Those eyes looking into mine as she moved closer was just as good as the kiss. In that moment, we broke our kiss and each of us looked deep into the other's eyes.</p> <p>"I really want you to know. That kiss started with all my heart. It was just the beginning. I won't lie. We really need to have that discussion tonight. I just can't get it out of my head that I just kissed you tonight. I want us to be together forever and it will not be as bad as our earlier relationship. I can't get out of my head that I've been with you tonight and I think I'd like to meet you sometime." I looked back at her and saw tears filling her eyes as she said this. I was shocked. I felt a sense of disappointment and confusion at her statement. I realized I had to say something. Something really. I wanted to say what I really wanted to say, but didn't have the courage to do it.</p> <p>She smiled again and leaned forward and kissed my lips again. "I know this is going to sound strange, and I know we've never had any serious feelings about each other. We just...it just seemed so..." I didn't know what to say. What to say.</p> <p>"Sex, sex, sex. It's our little secret. We'll never discuss anything outside of that. But you're the only one making the change. I feel so lucky to be with you. Thank you so much for trusting me with your heart." I just smiled at her and squeezed her. She held me tightly as we shared a soft, happy, happy kiss.</p> <p>"I love you, my sweet, sweet baby. I really do. And I do so happy that the two of you have come to know each other so well and to be together." She kissed me, as the words seemed to roll off our tongues. She stood next to me, with her hand at my hip. I took her hand and brought it to my lips and kissed her lips as well. My hand in her hand and her hand in mine. The kiss was filled with feeling of closeness but also of love and lust. We stood there, in our embrace for what seemed to be minutes, before our embrace broke. It was slow, sweet, a moment of the purest expression of love we had ever shared. We stood there, holding each other gently, not wanting or wanting to lose the sensation, the feel of being together.</p> <p>"I know you've felt the same thing too," she said softlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
