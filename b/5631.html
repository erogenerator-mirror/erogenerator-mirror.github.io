I turned my head and gave you a light kiss. "I'm not the type of guy who would have sex with you and I didn't know it was that good. My wife never understood it and said that it really made me feel that hot! Anyway I don't think it's too bad, we are just a couple and we're just two people having the time we need."</p> <p>I kissed her again and we turned our heads and looked at the movie again. I could feel it growing inside me, I could feel it slowly moving up my spine and I felt my heart starting to race. She put her hands on your ass cheeks and slowly pulled you closer to her. Her lips brushed against yours and you kissed her back with one of your most passionate kisses. Your kisses were soft and slow and passionate and my mind was racing with pure electricity. She moved your hands over my breasts and you tweaked my nipples between your fingers. My own body was building up to another orgasm and I felt myself starting to moan into your lips as I let my body go over the edge. I leaned back against you and we kissed again and it was wild and passionate and passionate.</p> <p>We broke our kiss and I looked deep into your eyes as we stared into one another's eyes. You reached your hand around my back and rested a thumb on each cheek of my ass and you pulled me hard against your body. I moaned louder into your mouth and we kissed again. The kiss became wilder and I pushed harder into your groin. Your cock was rubbing against my wetness all throughout our kiss. I turned to face you and your body slid over mine as he ground against mine. I had the desire to have you in my mouth but I wanted to watch this for a long time.</p> <p>I felt your hands pull harder on my cheeks and then you pulled from me to look me in the eyes. I opened my mouth to look at you and I could see fear and lust in your eyes.</p> <p>"My God! I'm so fucking horny baby. Why are you so wet?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just a little. I was just thinking about you the whole movie."</p> <p>I looked at your body and wanted to do the same to you. I leaned down to kiss the side of your neck and nibbled on your ear. You took my hand and placed it on the hot wet spot on your body. I could feel you moving closer to the edge of the bed again. I continued to run my finger tips up and down your thigh and you moaned into my ear again. I rubbed your hand over mine and I was amazed at the sensation of warmth moving around your fingers. I slid your hand from my breast and replaced it on my ass, rubbing and squeezing as I went.</p> <p>My kisses moved to the inside of your neck and I could feel that you were as hard as a pencil. I looked at your face and I could see that you were excited and I could see you looking at her too. I put my middle finger between your lips and began to massage your clit. I continued to tease you until you were almost screaming with pleasure and then I moved one of your hands between us and I pulled back and placed that hand on my breasts. I closed my eyes and put your finger in my mouth and sucked on your middle. I moved your fingers back to your clit and teased it while I moved your hand toward mine.</p> <p>"Oh God, I need to fuck you," you moaned and I felt the electricity between us. I leaned back on the bed and ran my hands through your hair, then my lips trailed down to your neck and back up again to my breast. I pushed your hand away and used the other hand in mine. I ran the tip of my finger across your opening and you moaned again. I pressed my finger further in and you moaned again, this time louder. I pushed my finger in as far as it would go and you couldn't stop moaning and I could feel your hips start to buck. Your pussy was so fucking hot that I couldn't hold back any longer.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum baby," you said into my left ear.</p> <p>I took one finger and replaced it with my right and started to slide it in and out between your thighs. Your face was still buried in my chest as my finger went in and was about to fuck you. I put my hand on your hips again and turned you to face me. I kissed your lips and put my hand on your chest. I sat up and you looked at me as you kissed my breast.</p> <p>"I want to go slow tonight darling," you said.</p> <p>"I want it slow baby, I want to feel it all," I said.</p> <p>I got off the bed and walked slowly down the hall to your bedroom. I picked up my bag in the kitchenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
