She grabbed his cock, her small hand was almost the whole length; her hand barely around half of his prick.</p> <p>She leaned closer to his face and gave him a soft, wet kiss. She kissed him on the cheek, and said, "I want you, all of you, tonight, in every little crevice of my body."</p> <p>He felt a jolt of electricity shoot from his cock, to the very fingertips at his wrist, then right into his groin. He had a jolting climax.</p> <p>She stood beside him, watching his body as it shook uncontrollably. She felt her own body quiver as she approached him in the same way.</p> <p>She sat on the couch next to him and ran her legs up and down his leg.</p> <p>"You are incredible, Derek. You feel so good in me. I've dreamed of this for so long. I'm not ever going to get enough of you." She leaned up in his lap, kissing his face with her tongue, and whispered, "It's okay, lover. Just enjoy the feeling of being fucked properly."</p> <p>Derek groaned, and they heard her moan as he entered her hard, like a jack rabbit, and sank deep within her. She wrapped her arms and legs around him and kept him where she wanted him.</p> <p>Patti leaned back, and began to kiss down Derek's neck to his firm chest. When she reached his nipples, she flicked her tongue over them, eliciting a low moan by the light of the candles.</p> <p>Derek leaned his head back as Patti licked and suckled his nipples. He began to thrust into her once again, a soft, steady rhythm. Each thrust brought his cock deep below her, and Patti could feel the ridge of him against her inner walls.</p> <p>Both bodies started to tremble as a powerful climax rocked them. "God, Derek! I love your cock! I love it!"</p> <p>She started to tremble when she felt a wet rush of her own fluids, and she screamed, "Derek! It's aaaagh!"</p> <p>Marlene came in her hand as Derek pounded her from behind. Her eyes squeezed shut, and she trembled uncontrollably. Derek grabbed her ass cheeks, forcing her to bounce on his cock, as he filled her pussy to overflowing.</p> <p>The sight of Marlene climaxing brought on his climax, as well. Marlene pulled him into her and cried, "You're so big!" Derek fucked her vigorously, filling her pussy to bursting point with his seed. They rolled onto their backs, panting.</p> <p>Gasping for breath, Patti whispered to Derek, "Get off me! Put that thing of yours away! I need to get dressed. Derek, we're supposed to go to bed after this."</p> <p>Derek groaned when he heard the words, but he got up, and kissed her softly, and left the room without a word.</p> <p>The next morning, Patti and Marlene were in another room. "Hey, honey," she said, "Did you see him fucking you? How many times have you thought about him?" Patti knew, without words, that Marlene was not a lesbian, and the thought filled her with guilt.</p> <p>They both smiled at each other, knowing that they did have a wild and beautiful marriage, and that it would get better in the future.</p> <p>When Derek finished his second cup of tea and got up, Marlene was still curled up in her bed, sipping on her coffee.</p> <p>Marlene was waiting outside Patti's room.</p> <p>She pulled away, and said, "I'm ready just for you." She leaned down and kissed her lover. "Can I have a hug first?"</p> <p>Marlene opened her arms. Patti took her in her arms, and they snuggled together, both kissing her cheeks.</p> <p>Marlene said, "I like you, and wanted to fuck you for so long, but this is kind of weird and weird. You and Derek broke up last night, but I wanted you as much as you wanted me."</p> <p>She kissed her, and gave Patti her full approval. "I love you, too. That you two were so happy together; that we had been so open to each other, that you made me feel so good, that I felt so good being with you. It makes me happy to be loved in that way.</p> <p>"Derek made me feel so good when you and I slept together last night. Last night, I felt so comfortable, I was able to talk to you while we slept."</p> <p>Marlene's arms tightened around Patti as she kissed her lover.</p> <p>Patti giggled as she said, "If you feel comfortable being naked with me, Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
