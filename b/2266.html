I asked. "What would you like to do?"</p> <p>She didn't answer me, just leaned against me, her tits pressing into me, her face next to mine, her tongue slipping along my lips, her nipples brushing across mine.</p> <p>"Maybe this," she said, "might be our third date. You just don't need to ask me 'what to wear', do you?"</p> <p>"No, no," I said firmly, "that's no way out of this. Let's go get your key and let our friends know we got married."</p> <p>"No! No! Let's go get the key and let our friends know I got married, we don't need to wait for the guys to catch up or the girls to come home. No, honey, let me go take a shower and let my friends know we've got the wedding." She kissed me and ran her hand through my hair, pushing her hard nubile body harder against me.</p> <p>When we started to walk toward the restrooms, we were both panting and she said, "I love you, honey. You know that." She leaned down and kissed me again.</p> <p>I stood there for a moment, then started to pull her toward the men's room, but she stopped me. She said, "Let's go back to our booth. We can make up for it when we get back." We quickly got through the restroom to her waiting car and we went inside to her office.</p> <p>I locked the door and leaned her against it, kissing her long and hard. Then I pulled up her skirt and sucked her tingling pussy, my tongue pushing back and forth inside her, my hand rubbing her clit as I licked her. "Oh!" she moaned. I got up off the chair and led her by the hand to the office door, opening it and pushing the handle.</p> <p>"Shit," I said. "It's locked!"</p> <p>"What do you mean? If it's locked, it means someone's got the key to my car. I don't care. You'll just have to climb into it, though. What kind of place is this anyway, I hope it's clean, not like this, not like this," she said. She sat down on the counter and unbuttoned her blouse, slowly, one button at a time, as if looking for an idea.</p> <p>I pulled my shirt off, then my pants, and I stood before her in my underwear, looking at her body from every angle. My cock was fully hard. She looked at my bare chest, at a little nipple, and then her eyes moved to my underwear, and she saw what I was looking at. "Your cock is all stiff, honey," was all she said. She saw it, saw my big hard cock in front of her, and she said, "You know, I've never seen one this big for my husband. It's big, hard, and so beautiful." She leaned forward and gently caressed it, her soft hands caressing my heavy muscles. Her finger felt hot, and I let her do that, I just let her do whatever she wanted. It didn't take long for me to come, so she got up, removed her panties, and sat back down once more.</p> <p>"Let me go get my clothes, honey," she said.</p> <p>I was so turned on, not knowing what else to do to make her happy. "No, you can't," I told her. "I can't leave my panties on, I want to see what it looks like, because I won't be able to get them back on, if they come off." I got her to my bedroom and stripped off her clothes, before putting my shoes on. She lay down on my bed, just like she had been laying down the first time, but now it was empty, her skirt and blouse on one side of the bed, and her bra on the other.</p> <p>I stood above her, looking at her beautiful body, her legs and bush just a little bit of hair. I lifted my cock and ran the cock-head across her nipples, and she watched me as her breasts got stiffer. I sat down beside her on the bed, and kissed her, running my tongue in her mouth, across her chest, between her breasts, around her nipples, and I held her hands, as I kissed down her back.</p> <p>I felt her hands again under them, and this time my hands found her clit, and I rubbed it, my hand moving from her clit to her pussy, finding her labia, then I pushed two inside her, sliding her wetness up my fingers.
