But maybe I'll give you an extra few minutes to clean up. I don't want you to think that I'm just going to sit there all day like a nervous, over anxious child." Her laugh was cute, and made him smile.</p> <p>"Don't worry about that. I'll take care of myself as soon as I get some food down, and then we can start cooking. But first I'm just about wiped out."</p> <p>"Okay." She closed the door. He felt like an ass. He knew it, but in a good way, because it wasn't like when they were in each others arms after having sex. "Maybe we can get something going."</p> <p>"Maybe we can," he said, hoping that wouldn't come to pass. His penis was at half mast when he had walked in on them. He started to get up.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, "you'll get sick if you stay. Come on, I don't care." She took his hand, pulling him to her, kissing his lips. Her tongue came out tentatively to taste his mouth. He grabbed her butt and pulled her closer, feeling his penis harden. She pulled his face down to hers, kissing him with a passion he hadn't even thought he might have, and soon they were kissing on the floor of the bathroom while the water turned off.</p> <p>It wasn't until she pulled away from the kiss that he felt his cock stir in response to the thought that she might as well be completely nude. But as he stood there, with his cock standing straight up, watching her, he was thinking it. As they parted she reached out to his belt and undid it, then unbuckled his pants and then his zipper. Lathering up her hand against his cock, she wrapped his cock in her hand and began to stroke him lightly.</p> <p>"Oh... God..." He looked down at her.</p> <p>"You wanna fuck me?" he asked.</p> <p>"God, yes," she said, "but you didn't do anything."</p> <p>"It's not what I meant." He was trying hard not to sound surprised. She giggled, "I meant I needed some time to get used to taking a cock in my mouth."</p> <p>"Okay," she said, and went to her bedroom. On the way, she took his cock in her hand again. "There's a reason I like to give you blow jobs," she said, stroking him lightly "and I'm afraid it might hurt if you start thinking bad thoughts."</p> <p>He thought she was going to stop him from continuing anyway. But when she slid down to her knees as she finished undressing he realized there was more to what she wanted. "Maybe this'll help," he said.</p> <p>"What do you think, my friend? Is it too sore?" She said, standing up and looking down at his hard cock.</p> <p>"Nope."</p> <p>She grabbed the base of his cock with two hands and began to tease him lightly before taking him into her mouth.</p> <p>Her mouth was wet and warm, and all he could do was moan his approval. She worked her lips up and down his shaft, and he had to stop himself from reaching around to stroke her hair. When she took him out of her mouth he thought she got him off with her hands, just by her lips and tongue sucking him down to his balls. Before long he had his entire length in her mouth and down her throat, trying to hold himself back. But she kept going and moving her hand on the underside of his cock, making long strokes with her lips. His legs gave out underneath him, and he fell against the wall with his head falling against it. She stayed there with her head still against him while she caressed him while she brought him back to the edge again. Now it was his turn to moan. He reached out his hands to her back and gently caress down her tanned skin, taking in her full breasts and pushing them together under her. Her stomach felt so soft to his fingers, and he could smell just how full her breasts were. He pulled her down to him, pushing them back against his chest. A drop of her saliva ran from the corner of her upper lip to his nipple, leaving a trail down to his stomach again.</p> <p>"Now we're even," she said, as though it had been planned that he would be the first to start this journey. She began to knead his sack and balls with her hands. "I want to see the pleasure in your eyes as I play with you," she said, "because I want to see theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
