Her eyes were on the ground.</p> <p>When I'd seen her lying there, as lovely as it was, I'd taken her up to my room. There was no hurry to get up, and nothing was a lot of trouble to undo or get out. Just lying in each others arms, I enjoyed touching her. It wasn't until I could feel her hand caressing my cock that I realized we hadn't gone all the way like we had last night. I also knew she had been ready for me in bed, so maybe she'd have stopped me if she'd wanted to.</p> <p>I didn't care if she had stopped. All that mattered was that she wanted me.</p> <p>I knew that we were both pretty sure this evening was going to be pretty special, and that as much as I wanted to do anything, for sure I had to see her as a woman—something I'd never done with all of the other boys I'd been with.</p> <p>We got up and walked out to our front room and the girls helped us carry breakfast in. I watched as she walked, and it was nice watching her hips sway as she walked.</p> <p>"Wow," I said, "you really look like a little girl."</p> <p>"Oh I'm not, but you see what I'm talking about. Not only do you see more of my body than a lot of the other boys do, but I do all kinds of things for you at the same time."</p> <p>As I watched, I realized we hadn't said much of anything. We both seemed nervous, and I think that if anyone did ask, I'd say they wanted me to go with them.</p> <p>After breakfast, she went around the corner to my living room. I looked at her, smiled at her, and walked back to her with my hand out. She took it; and we kissed, softly at first, and then more passionately. We were kissing deeply and our hands went from caressing to touching each other all over with hardly any resistance. Her tongue explored my mouth, and we made out for about thirty seconds, before we broke our embrace, got out of our clothes, and started the process again.</p> <p>She was all right for that. She was a hot little girl. I didn't realize how much she was into it until I felt her hand on my cock. It startled me, especially considering I didn't get to put it in her.</p> <p>She slid up on me, her knees on either side of me as I reached down to feel her ass. She spread her legs wide and I guided my cock into her as far as I could go, before sliding back up. It turned me on to know that this was the girl that I was fantasizing about a lot more than a day before.</p> <p>She was just so tight; not like any one who'd ever been in the position, that she probably had never been stretched out. It was a great combination.</p> <p>As I continued to move my cock in and out of her, she let her legs go and lifted them. I moved them around and put them on his chest. My arms went around her and I held her as I started to move more. I could feel her tighten up around me too, and I could feel it start to ripple. We continued to move together as we continued to hear loud moans, and hear the wet slapping sounds of our bodies and our groans.</p> <p>A few minutes after I felt her tighten even more around my cock, she had another orgasm, and I felt the same as I continued to move, holding her tighter with each other.</p> <p>But then I started moving again, and I stopped, keeping the rhythm.</p> <p>"Wow. That was really nice," she said. She looked up and smiled, before lifting herself up and sitting back on her feet. Then she got up and came to me and lay next to me. I held her, as we talked a lot about what just went on last night.</p> <p>"You're a really good lover, Mike," she said.</p> <p>"Thank you. It was all about you."</p> <p>"You're one of the sexiest women I've ever had."</p> <p>"Well, if you're like me, I can't say it quite like that, but I do have something of a special relationship with my best friend."</p> <p>"And what is that, I don't even know what it looks like." I thought she was going to say something about us being lovers, and, but I think she just wanted to let me know and be open to me her real feelings.</p> <p>I took off her shirt as we talked for a while, and kissed her breasts. "You have lovely breasts," I said, and then I moved one of her breasts to my mouth and did the same thing that she had done to me.
