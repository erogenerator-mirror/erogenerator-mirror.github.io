"You're paying for it today." He gave her a half smile.</p> <p>"I'm not," she snapped a little sadly. "Please Mr. Jenkins!" She raised her voice above his.</p> <p>"I'll take that," he said as he handed her a wadded up $100 dollar bill, "and then just tell me to fuck off." He took the money and put it into her hand. "See? You've no choice then," he grinned and hefted her over his shoulder.</p> <p>"Get the fuck out!" she screamed and struggled as he carried her, "this is not going anywhere anytime soon."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>A few days later, at the same place, she was again alone in her dormitory at the University of New York. The door to her own room was open, only just closing to lock when she noticed a light on and went to the lockers. She opened the door to the darkened room. The light was on, and she immediately noticed the little metal cage on the floor at the end of the cage. Her eyes became as wide as saucers as she realized that it was locked.</p> <p>"Hey, I didn't lock the door," she yelled when that she could see the door as it was bolted. She started to strip off the last of her clothes, but he stopped her.</p> <p>"No, my dear," his voice said, "it's just for you." He led her to the cage. The cage had two small steel rings, one each for her wrists and ankles, and one for her arms, and both of those rings were secured together, so that when she tried to escape, she couldn't. She had the freedom of movement of a dog in a cage. Her arms were still bound and she had the upper-hand free, but she couldn't do more than attempt to pull the collar off.</p> <p>"You will learn to respect my authority when you are in my position," He said.</p> <p>"Don't worry," he smiled as he opened the small wooden box. Inside, there were a collection of small plastic objects. She looked around at the items in surprise. She hadn't expected to be used that way. She had heard of those things, and wondered if they involved women, but never used them. She recognized that. She didn't know how many of the objects had been used, but they had all been used against her.</p> <p>"I'll just have to make sure you make good use of them," She smiled as she picked up the small metal device.</p> <p>"That can be really hard to get used to," he laughed, "the rings feel really strange on your wrists." He sat on the couch, looking at her intently. "Would you like me to put these things on you?"</p> <p>"No! No, I already know that!" She replied. She was completely naked. She stood there nervously while he looked down at her. He removed all of his clothes, leaving him in the dark while she stood there. She started trying to cover herself. He reached out and grabbed her wrists, pinning them to the metal ring at the top of the cage. He smiled as he noticed that she was now in charge.</p> <p>"If you don't obey me in one of these things, it will be much worse for you," he smiled as he put the metal item on her, "for when you get scared." He walked her over to where there was a pillow and lay her down on it.</p> <p>"I'm afraid she may try to put them on you, please," He said as he walked around her, examining her body. She looked about helplessly, wondering what she herself looked like. He looked at the cage.</p> <p>"I'm afraid we can't get rid of this thing, please," she pleaded as she tried to get away.</p> <p>"You might be able to get away, sweetheart," he laughed and picked up a small wire and attached it to a wire that was there. "Let me see how it feels," he whispered as he walked to the cage and lifted the metal ring so that both of her wrists were encased in one of the rings. "Do you like what you see?" He asked. She nodded in agreement. "Now we're even," he smiled while he opened the key. The knob of the lock released, the knob slipping free. He walked away.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"Now," he smiled as he removed her blindfold, "let me help you." He pulled the cuffs behind her head and cuffed her hands together and tied her elbows together. She was completely helpless. He took her hands and cuffed them together and put them over her head. Next, he used a small piece of rope to tie her feet to the cageâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
