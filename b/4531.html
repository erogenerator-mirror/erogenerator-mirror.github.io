Does it turn you on to be with another woman?'</p> <p>'Yes, yes it does. But...I guess it's not much at all. I have no idea what turns me on, if you know what I mean; but...it is something we'd have to try'.</p> <p>She nodded to my question. That was a good response.</p> <p>As soon as I said that, she looked at me:</p> <p>'You know, darling, you will have something on your mind when we meet; and I really hope so!', she said, as she kissed me again: 'I have something you'll love too!''</p> <p>I took two steps toward her and looked at her from the corner of our eyes. I kissed her on the mouth and then slid my hands under her tank top; cupped her small breasts through her bra. She kissed me again and I ran them down her neck to the small bit of hair there, between her cleavage; running my fingers gently along her skin...she arched one finger down my collarbone and down my chin, into the hollow of my throat; taking my chin in her hand. I could feel her breathing change slightly. I smiled and kissed her, running my tongue around her bottom lip; moving my hands down to her waist and back up. I pulled her to me and we kissed for a while. I ran my fingers over her bra: 'You're beautiful, Marlene, if only for your beauty'. She blushed slightly, feeling the warmth growing between her legs. I pushed the bra cups up, exposing her full breasts; they were large and creamy and firm and I lifted them up, lifting them, pulling the nipples between my fingers:</p> <p>'Can I have them', I whispered to my daughter.</p> <p>She nodded again, her mouth full with mine, her tongue exploring my mouth and licking me. I ran my hands down her back as I looked her up and down, her hair almost to the sides of her face; her neck straight down; her breasts almost up to her waist; her hips a little forward but very low; her lower belly taut with the little bumps of pubic hair. I lifted her tank top, and put my hands on her small breasts. Her nipples were already hard, almost aching to be touched. I ran my fingers across her chest, down to her stomach, and to the waist of her pants. I felt those pants, but they felt as if they too had a zipper; she hadn't been wearing underwear, the pants were tight against her body, leaving not a bit of flesh. I had never seen a pair smaller, so her ass would be on public display too. It felt warm and soft against my fingers:</p> <p>'Marlene, you're very beautiful, and I love what I see', I whispered to her:</p> <p>'I can't get over that'. She didn't object, but her face, now turning red, was hard now, I noticed.</p> <p>'Well, you look so sexy; you look so nice, darling', I whispered to her. I continued to move my palms down - my left hand moving back up - tracing the outlines of her neck; then down to her breasts, as I moved my lips to a lower one. I found her nipple and, like with my left hand, began to gently squeeze and roll it around my fingers; first at first, and then with more force; rolling the fat bit between my thumb and finger. She was very erect now, pressing it upward into my hands as I squeezed it, my palms squeezing every inch of her soft flesh. I moved both hands away.</p> <p>'Marlene, take off your bra'. Her breathing deepened and she raised her arms, unhooked her belt, and, with great difficulty, let the flimsy top off; she held her arms outstretched, inviting me to help. I knelt before her. I gently lifted her hair from her shoulder to let it fall over her left shoulder, making a deep V with her neck; the hair around the edge of her left ear pointed slightly upward; just below her ear. Again, I touched her there. She moved her head back and moaned a little. I kissed her on the ear and, now, in her ear:</p> <p>'Are you feeling horny?', I whispered: 'I don't know why. Why, dear?'</p> <p>Her breathing, the sound of her soft moans, her eyes staring deeply into mine; and, to be honest, it was all I could do not to start getting aroused, or to start feeling horny.</p> <p>'Is it turning you on, John?,'' she whispered, her lips still on mine:</p> <p>'Yes', I whispered back. 'Marlene, feel how stiffâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
