She whispered. "I'm glad to see you."</p> <p>"What's wrong sweetheart?"</p> <p>"I don't think I have one, at all."</p> <p>"That's okay. I'm sure I can walk."</p> <p>"Yeah, I could."</p> <p>"See you tomorrow."</p> <p>"Oh, right." He turned and strode quickly back towards the house.</p> <p>"You're a real treasure, love," she whispered as they stood by the fire and looked at the clouds. He kissed her lips several times and then went back to the house.</p> <p>He returned with a bag and sat down.</p> <p>"I don't think I'll be able to walk by the time I get back from the store." She said.</p> <p>"Why? Do you just need a lift home?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"You don't need to go home to change."</p> <p>"I'll be right there love. Where are you going to go?"</p> <p>"I've told you before, my friend always has a safe place to stay, and he'll never hurt me, that's all I'm saying."</p> <p>"I don't know how safe it is to have a safe place."</p> <p>"Why not. I'll take a safe man home with me, and we'll go home."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said as she leaned over and kissed him again.</p> <p>"I'll talk to you as soon as I get home."</p> <p>She smiled as she pulled away from him. She didn't seem that sure about being safe but she felt that way in her head. She was happy that things worked out like they did.</p> <p>The next day he drove her to work and let her out. He kissed her goodbye, promising to take her home as soon as he got out of the car.</p> <p>They sat on the front porch on sunny Sunday afternoons and talked. She was surprised at how close-knit they were and how much he felt that way.</p> <p>He was still looking at the horizon when they arrived at the office.</p> <p>"How about getting here?" He asked and she just smiled.</p> <p>She took him into the restroom for privacy and went to the desk to get her work bag. He followed her, holding her and kissing her shoulder as he followed. She didn't want him to leave though and as soon as he was dressed she got on her knees and unbuckled his pants. He looked at her and she just laughed and held the hard cock up for him. She didn't mind him seeing her work boots on either. He smiled and pulled his shirt up and over his head. She pulled his underwear down and began to work on him again. He pulled his pants back up and sat down as she worked him to completion. She then stood and took his pants off. He had the biggest cock she'd ever seen. It was a good eight inches long and thick. She reached down and wrapped her hand around him and began to stroke him. She looked up at him and told him how lucky he was to be able to make her husband want to give her this cock more. It hadn't dawned on her how much that sounded like her love making.</p> <p>"I can think of nothing more beautiful than getting a hard cock while you are doing this. You make me hard so quickly."</p> <p>"I think you'll need a lot more practice than that." She said as she looked down at his cock. It curved down a bit farther and seemed to grow.</p> <p>She then stood up and went over to the couch. She began to kiss him again. She pulled her shirt off over her head and smiled when she saw him remove his shirt.</p> <p>He dropped his pants to his ankles and sat back down on the couch. He pulled her down on top of him. She could feel his hard cock pressing against her belly and she moaned as she felt it touching her. She pulled her shirt off and began to kiss her way down his chest, stopping when she was close to her destination. She kissed her way down and began working her way back up. She stopped again and stopped right before kissing her way over to his stomach. She looked up and saw him take her hand and place it on his cock. She began to stroke him lightly as her tongue darted out. When she got to his cock she took the head between her lips and sucked lightly. He groaned and she had her head going faster. She wrapped her hand around it and began to stroke him. She was going slow as she wanted to tease him. He told her to keep going, it was her favorite thing to do when they were together.</p> <p>She continued to work him into her mouth as she lookedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
