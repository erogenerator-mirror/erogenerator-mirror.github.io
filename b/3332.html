I said, and she looked at me with wide, surprised eyes, then back at the screen again. I saw how much her mind seemed to be struggling to process. "I think we need to try a video again, don't you?" she said, hesitantly. I thought she might've had second thoughts.</p> <p>"Sure, no problem," I said. "What kind of video do you want me to call?"</p> <p>"Maybe a special movie," she said. "But I don't know that you would just go to it, or ask me." There was still a flicker of concern in her eyes as she said it, but the tension seemed to subside as she said it, which I found incredibly cute.</p> <p>"OK. I see," I said, then I got up to look at my watch. "I'll let you decide what's acceptable."</p> <p>She smiled and held up a pen and paper. "Here's what I think. I think you've only got about 4 more songs to get to," and then she reached for her computer, but I shook my hand and told her to hold the video up. "And I think you've gotten to the point where you're gonna have to say I'm still in charge of the video for awhile at least, if you want a good, detailed video of your birthday. It's up to you though."</p> <p>This time she didn't look up.</p> <p>I stood up, and pulled my shirt the rest of the way off, then pulled off my socks, and my trousers. I took off my socks, too, and turned around so she could look in the video. "You're doing better than I thought, you know," she said, wiggling her eyebrows at me. She came up to me and started moving so I pulled her hands away. "I see you're really enjoying this, too, I think," she said, taking one of my hands. She pulled it back, then put her other hand around my neck and neck, and kissed me. I started thrusting back, but she just kept pulling my hips and pulling me closer. Finally she just had to pull away, and I pulled her in front of me, kissing her forehead, her nose, and her lips. She was breathing fast, and her eyes looked tired. Her eyes were a bit ragged, even with what little we had done. I could just imagine having this young girl in my arms, and what that might be like in the future. My body ached, my mind and my mind a bit dizzy with emotion: not the emotional pain I had been feeling, but the emotional connection that had been building since before we began this.</p> <p>I could have been so in love with her; or maybe it was just that, with all the other stuff we had done together over the years, I felt like this was a new experience for me to experience a little bit. I hadn't been in love with a girl since that night, but it had been very intense and fulfilling in a different way. I really just needed it to be good as much as possible. It was so much more physical and emotional than just acting or fucking. I knew I had to try something with her, not just just having sex... but with a woman... just to see how it felt to have her in my arms.</p> <p>I was getting really hot, and the way we were dressed felt warm to me, especially as I was really enjoying her. I realized I could still get hard anytime she touched me, not just the top and sides of my thigh. "So, you've been looking for something to do to yourself," I said, taking a couple of steps back and turning around to face her. "And you've finally found one you like." She came up to me, and took the back of her hands and pulled from the waist of her skirt and sweater with both hands.</p> <p>"I need to know how you do it... at least a bit," she said. I couldn't really see her face anymore as she spoke, but I heard it, I could only imagine how it felt to her. She took her right hand and put it between her legs, pushing them even farther. "I want to see," she said. I didn't say anything. I just let her move the hand between us, and then I turned back to the camera.</p> <p>I looked back over at the video she took. There was still a couple of lines of white showing on the top of her face, and this time it was the black one, but a part was a bit shorter. She was still moving her hand up and down her torso, and I could tell she was getting closer to orgasm. It was definitely a different look on her face, but she didn't seem to mind.</p> <p>I kept turning the camera closer as I continued toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
