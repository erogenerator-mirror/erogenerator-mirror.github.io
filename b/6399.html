She felt his penis bob up and down next to her face. Without the distraction of her hair rubbing at the top of her mouth, she was unable to taste her friend's pussy. He was rubbing his penis over her face while he pumped his dick into her. The more he rubbed, the more she wanted. She could feel his dick throbbing as he pumped.</p> <p>The first spasm he felt as his jism shot out of his penis into her mouth triggered her orgasm. "I never knew you tasted like that, my boy." She smiled as her orgasm continued.</p> <p>He looked down at the girl as he felt himself. It was clear she was very confused. She could barely see anything and could almost feel nothing. He could only feel for her body. He wanted to be with her. He wanted to kiss her. He felt a warmth spreading from her lips.</p> <p>When he had recovered he looked back at his cock in her hair. "You want to fuck me again?" She didn't answer. Instead she opened her mouth and licked his cum from her lips.</p> <p>"Would you like me to fuck you?" His penis still throbbing. She nodded. He pulled her to her feet. He bent her over a chair. He grabbed her pants and panties from the floor and pulled them down with one hand. He looked at her. "Don't worry about the underwear, I will take care of everything else."</p> <p>He pulled her blouse open, grabbed her breasts and pulled her panties to the side with one hand. She didn't care, he didn't even think about doing it, but for the first time in her life she really wanted him to. He rubbed the head of his dick against the head of her pussy making her moan. He rubbed himself until he was ready and pushed.</p> <p>She didn't know if she was ready or not, but she felt his hard penis slide inside. She felt that it was easier than she wanted. "Oh, that feels good." She thought.</p> <p>He fucked her slowly at first. He let her have him a few moments at a time and then picked up the pace. All the while, she could feel herself pushing back. A third orgasm started to well up between the girl's legs. "I'm going to cum again." She heard herself say. "That feels so good."</p> <p>He felt himself start to cum himself. He was surprised by what happened next. She came and felt herself cum again. He felt her. A wave of warmth spread to her body. As he felt himself swell in her, he stopped.</p> <p>When he finally rolled off her, she was laying there panting. He kissed her breasts and her neck. "You should have told me you liked a lot of pain. I think you liked it because it did hurt you too."</p> <p>"I could have told you, but I couldn't. This is for you, remember?"</p> <p>"I know. I love every second of it." He held her close and let her fall asleep.</p> <p>Chapter 9.</p> <p>When her lover came for another visit, he was not ready for the experience he had just had. He didn't have the energy to try again. His heart hurt just a little bit more each time they made love. Now they were lovers. "We can do this," he thought.</p> <p>The first night he stayed at her place, she brought over her roommate's clothes for the week. Their roommate had gone away on a business trip for the weekend. They spent the day by each other's bed. He watched her as she slept. She looked so beautiful lying there in her pink nightie. He loved this nightdress. It was a light weight pink material. She had a small gold necklace on her neck. She was his. He looked at his now almost completely erect penis as it lay on top of her panties. He could almost see her panties moving. He reached down and felt his penis. He wanted to rub it but couldn't. He was afraid to. He couldn't let her know that he wanted her to do it to him. He couldn't be in such trouble if he made love to her like a whore. He had to take his chances.</p> <p>Then the nightdress hit the floor. The only thing covering him was her bra. He could see the silhouette of her small breasts as they swayed in front of him. She lay back on her bed completely naked. Not waiting for him to do whatever she said, he got between her legs. She felt his dick on her pussy as he pushed inside.</p> <p>"Do it. Just do it. It feels good," she said.</p> <p>He pushed himself into her. The only resistance to being inside was the pleasure she felt at feeling him inside of her.
