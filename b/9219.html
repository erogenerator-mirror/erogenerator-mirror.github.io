Our eyes were locked as I leaned in and kissed her lips softly.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered, "I want it, I want it in my bellybutton, in my pussy, I want it in my mouth." It was a statement, one I would soon make that would tell me everything my body needed to know. I kissed her again and our arms moved together. After what seemed to be quite awhile she gently pushed me away. We looked intently at each other for a few seconds before I said, "I'm sorry, there is nothing else to say." The silence that followed made me want to shout, but it was too late. Her gaze was a question, I looked into her eyes as though I was going to say something else and I was but the next moment she held out her hand and shook my hand. "I've wanted to kiss you for twenty years. Now is the opportunity." Then we were both standing there with our hands on hips.</p> <p>"Oh, I was looking forward to it when I first heard you say you wanted me to move out of your house," she said with a mischievous smile, "It is nice to have someone around to share the moment with." She paused and looked down at my lips and then I kissed her as my hands moved up and down her waist and then came to rest on the soft flesh that lay beneath her robe. My hands gently cupped and caressed her breasts and her skin was exquisite. She pulled back with a smile and said with a smile, "That was so romantic, I could tell that much in you the first night we met."</p> <p>I kissed her and said, "There's one more thing," I stood and quickly unbuttoned her robe and slowly peeled it back and as it fell open I saw that she was wearing a see-through negligee. She was beautiful.</p> <p>"M'lady," I smiled, "it will come off in a few minutes." I stepped back and looked down at her and then I slipped into a more formal position as I said, "I'm going to make some coffee while you get dressed," as I walked off to the kitchen.</p> <p>"That sounds nice," the beautiful woman behind the counter said with a big smile. She picked up a cup and then asked me, "Do you like it?"</p> <p>As I poured her a cup I asked, "Did you know you had a woman in the house this evening?"</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I got my surprise tonight." She paused for a few moments and then reached forward and rubbed my chin like I was trying to pull a lever to get the conversation going again. She said it quietly so I could hear.</p> <p>"I'm curious," I said softly, "how this is all working out with me."</p> <p>The conversation and laughter were just the beginning. I knew it would be a long day and I wanted to get some real action out of the session so I took advantage of our earlier conversation to bring one of the few available cups with me. I sat the coffee on the stool and picked up one of the cups and then sat down. I picked it up and brought it to my lips and sipped it slowly. It was good to have a light breakfast from one of those great food shops or a coffee shop. This was not what I expected and I found it to be very erotic to put my hand on that thigh. "M'lady, I didn't expect this," I smiled to myself as I sat and thought about the night ahead until she answered the door behind me.</p> <p>Without saying a word she came over, took my hand and led me toward the bedroom. I followed quickly, and she lay down on the bed with her legs dangling over the edge. She kissed me deeply and as she was kissing me I knelt on one knee and then moved the other knee under her. She laughed out loud as the first thing she did was to lift one foot up and then the other as I kissed her inner thighs that were just barely covered by the sheet and then up to her tummy which had no discernible hair. When she rolled on to her back and pulled the sheet up to her waist I could see most of her breasts in profile. "I've been watching you walk around that room as though you were a professional woman," I smiled as she rolled my head and then pulled me toward her. She kissed me again before she said, "Is this a good or bad day for talking?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, not really. This is an incredible day for me and I plan on doing it every day that we spend the next several weeks together."</p> <p>"Noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
