Her lips made a sound as he moved closer, and before he could really even say anything, she spoke again, louder. "Oh - oh - OH! OH!" she was crying out, so loud it seemed to bounce off the wall in her face. "Oh! Don't stop! I'm - my legs are shaking - please, don't stop! Mandy!"</p> <p>Mandy gasped, eyes wide with shock, her body quivering, toes curling as she came. "Oh my god!" she gasped in a husky whisper, her hands clutching fistfuls of the tiled wall as she struggled to keep her balance. His cock, still hard as steel, throbbed hotly inside her, the thick shaft twitching and jerking as he fucked her.</p> <p>"Yes! I'm coming - I'm coming!" Mandy whispered, her head rocking back and forth as his cock shot into her with a whoop and his balls tightened. His cock erupted and emptied what must've been gallons of cum into her womb. Her own pussy clenched him, and she was helplessly clutching him as he fired again and again into her. Her legs shook beneath her and her knees shook as her pussy tightened, pulsing and throbbing around him.</p> <p>Mandy's head slumped forward and back as her body spasms trembled, and her body was covered with perspiration with her trembling. "Mandy!" he finally panted, still buried deep inside her as his own body continued to shudder against hers. He didn't move, but his cock slipped out of her just enough so he could slide one of the clothespins off with his freed hand. He put one arm around Mandy and held her against him while she moaned with each pulse of her pussy.</p> <p>"Ohhh, Mandy - sorry!" Mandy moaned with relief as she saw how he'd finished. She'd let him fuck her. Oh how she'd thought it wouldn't be that hot! As she lay there, her body, hot after her climax, it had a momentary thrill to know that her friend was enjoying it, that she could now do this without being judged. She wanted to tell her.</p> <p>Mandy looked around the narrow hallway after him, looking back to see where he'd gone. Her pussy was all swollen and sore and feeling warm. "I was, I don't know," she murmured. "We shouldn't be doing this."</p> <p>"Don't worry about any of it," he answered, reaching up to caress her cheek and kiss her again. "I'm not done," he continued, lifting her off her feet and helping her to the bed. "Lie on your back. I'll bring your breakfast." He turned off the light, holding her hand as she slid onto the bed, a little unsteadily. He took her in his arms. "Mandy, are you ok - or is this because of who I'm?"</p> <p>"Mmmhmm!" she said as he lay her on the small of her back. She smiled up at him, her eyes glazed and full of love and she hugged him tight to her in what could only be described as a sisterly hug, her breasts pressing into his chest as she leaned up to kiss him. "I don't care," she whispered, her hands moving to the top button of his shirt.</p> <p>"What does that have to do with me?" he said, his tone playful.</p> <p>"I think I want to do something - really something - with you," she added, giving him a playful tug. "That's, I'm going to let you come in me."</p> <p>"I'd have to get another condom," he said, sliding his hand up her body and grabbing the bottom hem of her skirt. He pulled then around her waist and onto her back, leaving her skirt on, and then slid his hand down her stomach and around to her front - and then back up again. He started moving his fingers around, sliding down to her clit, circling her and pressing her up, then down again. He could feel her wetness where his cock was still inside her. She could hardly move. Her legs were trembling in each of his hands now, her face screwed up in a grimace of pleasure as he rubbed her, his fingers pressing down through her pussy-lips and into her, over and over again, as close as she'd let them be. He felt her body shudder, and she moaned his name as she came again, eyes closed and mouth open.</p> <p>"Mmm, I've got to try that," he sighed, reaching for the condom and unwrapping it. He slipped it up inside her, then began moving his hand up, moving her legs apart and around his hips as she began to move with himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
