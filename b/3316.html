I whispered. "Mmmm..."</p> <p>She lifted her fingers to her mouth and gently licked the wetness out of them. I moaned and my cock throbbed as her hands caressed my body...her fingers slowly tracing the curves of my hips.</p> <p>"We should probably stop." She muttered, releasing my cock in surprise.</p> <p>I sat back and gazed into her eyes, feeling my chest flush with nerves. Her smile was still radiant, even in darkness, her eyes full of mischief as she spoke.</p> <p>"Do you want me to continue?" She whispered, the words spilling over with a teasing tone.</p> <p>"Oh, yesss..." I breathed. "Yes..."</p> <p>"Good." She winked as she slipped her fingers around my hardening shaft and slowly stroked me. "You have a lovely cock."</p> <p>I just leaned in and pulled her against me, my hand sliding across the back of her neck as my lips captured hers, tasting her, feeling her body heat pressing against mine, and pressing harder into me. Her hands slipped down my chest, squeezing my muscles, her nails tracing my sides. "And you have a wonderful cock..." She whispered.</p> <p>"I...it looks fantastic." I smiled. The sight of her naked flesh against mine brought me up almost instantly. Her eyes were closed as her head fell back onto my shoulder as her fingers caressed and squeezed my dick.</p> <p>Her lips were already wrapped firmly around my shaft, pulling me closer, her fingers working at my base as her tongue sought to envelope the tip of my dick. My hands slid onto her hips, tugging her against me to deepen the contact. I felt the softness of her skin, the heat there, and then the wetness that surrounded the head of my cock...her own wetness...her tongue...</p> <p>I held her by the waist, my lips barely grazing her mouth as I began to unbutton her dress. The softness of her skin was a sensual contrast to the hardened rough texture of my flesh as they were revealed by her tight black lacy bra and her ample tits.</p> <p>I slid the sleeves off her body and let them slide down her arms, letting the fabric fall to the ground, her arms free to move easily to my fingers, which began to stroke her arms.</p> <p>"Please..." She whispered, her breathing deepening.</p> <p>I continued to tease her, my fingers tracing the curve of her spine, tracing the swell of her ass in the dress, pulling her close. It was hard to breathe, the sound of her moans filling the air around us. Her body was so warm and soft, her nipples hardened against my palms as my fingers stroked over her skin. As if she knew my intention there, her hands moved beneath my hands and she slid them up my body. Her fingers moved up my chest to pinch my nipples as her own hands slid up over my shoulder, pressing my body hard against hers as she leaned back.</p> <p>I pulled back, my lips trailing up her jaw to her cheek.</p> <p>"Oh my God..." She murmured. "I never thought there was anything so erotic." She sighed as my fingers continued exploring her. "Let's go...I want to go slowly...let me enjoy you..." I was more than ready, I needed to feel her skin and my dick against her at the same time, as much as she did. She was perfect, so very, very desirable. I needed to be inside her. She could bring me to climax if she moved.</p> <p>"Please, let me go right now..." Her breath had hitched in her throat; her mouth was moving, her lips were moving, her lips so soft... "Right now...let me go...please..."</p> <p>I slid my hand down over her hips to touch her thighs, just above the stockings that covered her thighs. Her skin was soft and warm underneath me as I moved to her feet and my lips left a trail of kisses over her toes and up her thighs to her stomach, where I kissed slowly as I worked my way back down, my hands running up her sides then back up again.</p> <p>"No...no...it's not what...it is what you are..." She cried out as I stopped suddenly before she could finish.</p> <p>"What is?"</p> <p>"I want you to go slow, please..." she sobbed. She was still shaking from the loss of control and I knew it would be harder to let go than if everything just went on as they had been...but I had to make this moment last.</p> <p>"What is?" I smiled.</p> <p>"It's what you are...if we fuckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
