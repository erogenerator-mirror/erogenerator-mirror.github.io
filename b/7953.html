I enjoyed your taste and you are a fine specimen."</p> <p>"Thank you very much, Mistress."</p> <p>"Oh, do continue your ministrations, my pet. I want to see you cum, too."</p> <p>"Thank you, Mistress."</p> <p>"I think we'd just really enjoy some much-needed rest."</p> <p>She turned into the guest house. She sat on the sofa beside me and put on a soft, soft voice. She spoke, but her voice, I could not place what she was saying. "Please forgive me this time. I am so busy for the remainder of the week. I can't be here the entire time. Please forgive me."</p> <p>"Please, Mistress." I asked her. She replied, "I love you."</p> <p>I watched as she got up, went into her closet and came out with a pair of heels. "You are a beautiful, very sexy pet. You will be popular amongst other women, I hope."</p> <p>"Thank you, Mistress."</p> <p>"So, you don't want to have sex with me, right?'</p> <p>"I'm sure I will enjoy it more than I thought possible." I smiled back at her. "I just hope I am not too sore down there."</p> <p>She smiled back, "You are a good slave, my pet. I love to feel you in me. I hope as much as you feel me. I can't wait to be your Master!"</p> <p>"It will not be my Master. It would be you. "</p> <p>"I'll have all kinds of fun with you, my pet."</p> <p>She came to my lap and put her heels in my lap, then stood up and leaned very close as she pulled the heels from my legs and put each foot in the other. I felt the toe on my cock and I thought to myself I might cum on the spot.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see, my pet?" Her voice is a soft whisper.</p> <p>"Very much, Mistress."</p> <p>"Is this your first time, my pet?"</p> <p>"Yes, Mistress."</p> <p>"Good. I'm very proud of you."</p> <p>We both looked down, and I could see a light-up of red, as it was starting to color. "Is this my first time, submissive?" She asked me.</p> <p>"No, Mistress. It just came up with an idea."</p> <p>"What idea was that, my pet?"</p> <p>"Please. I want to be your submissive. I want you to dominate me in every way I am able to."</p> <p>"Are you serious?"</p> <p>"Absolutely. I hope you are not disappointed."</p> <p>"I'll be in touch, my pet."</p> <p>"Good, I love you, Mistress. And we will enjoy each other so much together, it will be wonderful. Do this for me."</p> <p>"You will like it, my pet," she said with a devilish smile.</p> <p>With that, as she reached into her purse and took out another pair of heels, she put them on, put my cock in them and pulled the toe to my lips. With a "good girl" she turned and left the apartment.</p> <p>I went back to the sofa. I turned on my tablet and watched as she removed a strap-on dildo from the bag. She had never used it before, and I found it surprisingly attractive. The straps were quite thick.</p> <p>She said, "Take off your dress, submissive."</p> <p>As she stood up, and took of her dress, I took in her body. Not a huge physique, but she had very nice abs and thighs. She was not overweight. She was very feminine in other ways.</p> <p>She undid her skirt, pulling it down and standing up before me. Then, standing on all fours, she had the heels on, my cock just inches from her pussy. She put the head of it into her pussy and lowered herself onto it, sliding it all the way up inside her. We were both in ecstasy.</p> <p>"Are you ready? "</p> <p>"Yes, Mistress. I want you there."</p> <p>"Good," she answered, and kissed me. She put her heels back on my legs and stood up. She kissed me again and turned to go back into the living room to get the toy. She returned a minute later holding something that had a long, curved dildo attached to it.</p> <p>She stood and reached for the toy. She held the toy for a minute or so, then held it as she backed away. "Are you ready, Sir?" She again kissed me and then said, "Good! Please take your time, Master."</p> <p>She turned around, placed the dildo inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
