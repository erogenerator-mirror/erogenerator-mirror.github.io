I can look for your wife, if that's what I want, but I don't have to get her involved," I explained.</p> <p>"Oh God, I hope so. I really hope we get to see them again," she said.</p> <p>"No way, that's the spirit, not you. Don't make me promise to see you again," I insisted, trying to make it sound as if we were working a sex game.</p> <p>"Well, I don't even know when my wife is supposed to arrive again," I said.</p> <p>"That's okay. She is with me, you can look at her or someone else. You aren't the only guy that thinks about something that your wife and I were doing the other day," she said.</p> <p>"Just wait. You'll enjoy it!" I added, smiling to myself.</p> <p>"Good. I think I'm going to call the office and see how I can get in touch with them. Maybe one of them can come and get me," she mused, nodding with my cock in her hand.</p> <p>"You really think your wife does?"</p> <p>"I've got to agree with everyone. This really was a little wild," she remarked, "I guess I'd say I was right."</p> <p>"Yeah, it was," I agreed, "and maybe it could have been any of us. She just got this great feeling that we were the only ones, and she was not even involved with us," I stated.</p> <p>"Well, at first I was happy that you had thought about it, but now I feel better. We really enjoyed ourselves. Maybe we could do another visit," she said with a little more confidence.</p> <p>"That was great, maybe we can do a little more than that," I offered back, trying to assure her I would not screw up anything in a way that might result in our marriage.</p> <p>"Oh, you're a nice guy, you can't just put yourself in my shoes. I could have had a real fun time with my husband," she said, blushing slightly, which didn't worry me. "And now I'm glad I did too."</p> <p>"Well, okay. It has been nice," I said.</p> <p>"You know, I should have suggested some sexual adventure before," she said.</p> <p>"Well, I can't say that I have to agree with that," I said, "Just thinking how much fun and excitement your husband felt when he got into oral sex in college," I said.</p> <p>"That was pretty wild," she agreed.</p> <p>So, here was this naked girl talking with me, while I was naked. It was kind of exciting, sorta hot, in a strange way. I hoped she wasn't uncomfortable with seeing me and other women. I hoped she was as good as my wife. I knew she had no idea that some of these other guys we knew would be into it.</p> <p>I couldn't help but smile to myself as I thought. She really seemed to be into it. I would never know that.</p> <p>The next evening as I walked through the mall, my wife called me over to say hello.</p> <p>"Hi, Jim," she greeted me.</p> <p>"Hi, Jen. I was talking to your wife, Kim," I said, putting the phone down.</p> <p>"Is she coming to dinner tonight? She's with friends from work, and she has a long drive tomorrow," she inquired, looking around.</p> <p>"Kim's not to work. She's going to have the weekend to rest. Her parents said not to mention that," I suggested.</p> <p>"Sure, she'll be at the bar," she said.</p> <p>"She already wants to go, so I'm sure that Kim and I can talk her off a first date," I added, laughing.</p> <p>"Yeah, that sounded good, Jim, but are you sure? What if Kim was getting off in her own car tonight?" Jen asked.</p> <p>"Not sure. She's not that drunk, and I'm not that upset. Did she want to come to dinner or do you have time?" I asked, trying to make a positive situation for her.</p> <p>"No, I don't think the two of you have a chance," she said, then added a bit more firmly, "I don't think Kim was ever upset with you. She's never got off with you in the car. I don't know if you're right for me."</p> <p>"Well, Jen, you can call me if you want me to go," I suggested.</p> <p>"I want to go. I'm not sure that my husband would take that kind of pressure from my husband," I told her.</p> <p>"I just might try to get off with him. I can't think she would be that way to me. I really don't know how, but I'll think about it," I concluded.</p> <p>"Yeah, sureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
