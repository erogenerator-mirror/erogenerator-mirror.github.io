I could see the desire and longing to go on, and it was as I was going along.</p> <p>"You know, I think you're a little bit better at looking like that," she said, and then added, "because you don't look much like your father."</p> <p>"That's a wonderful point," I lied.</p> <p>"I'm no kid either." And she looked more like a woman than any man I'd ever known.</p> <p>"You're very young," I answered with a look of false sympathy.</p> <p>Her hands were moving very lightly now, and it had all I could do to resist running my hand over hers. "You're no kid either," I managed to say in just the right way to make certain I'd not said one word that might have caused further awkwardness. It was a matter of life and death that we'd shared in an intimate way and I'd loved it. "Come on," I said, "let's get you back on your feet."</p> <p>"My feet?" She looked quizzical, but I could only tell by the look on her face that she thought I had the right idea. I think she was thinking that if she hadn't just had enough of walking around in front of me in heels then she wouldn't have known.</p> <p>"Come on," I laughed again as I turned her and gently lifted her up into my arms. Her weight was so much better than the weight I was usually carrying. "You're not carrying your purse anymore," I said, "but why don't we go over there?"</p> <p>And we did. It was a beautiful house, with a beautiful garden, and a very private terrace overlooking the river I love. I felt her arms around me, and it seemed very natural for us both to walk up to the door to see out into the garden below. She walked right up to the terrace where I pointed and I held a finger to my lips, indicating I should wait a few seconds to ensure that whatever she wanted to say would be heard. She had the most beautiful eyes and alluring red hair.</p> <p>"I love you," I told her softly as I reached out and lightly ran my hand down her arms.</p> <p>She shivered, and gave a brief gasp. "I love you, too, my darling," was all she said through her parted lips before we embraced again in a full-on hug.</p> <p>I pulled her down onto my shoulder, and it was the only way I could imagine to bring my lips to her small breasts, which I'd just gently sucked her nipples into the air. The feeling of her nipple between my lips and the hardness of her nipple against my tongue were both beautiful and wonderful, and it was just a matter of time until she moaned and cried out, sending the whole garden around us into a very delightful frenzy of delight.</p> <p>When she was done, I let her slide off my shoulder and lay her on the floor.</p> <p>"How are you feeling?" I asked.</p> <p>"Great. And it's a wonderful feeling, too." I kissed her forehead, and her hair, and her lips, and her nose.</p> <p>"You're sure of yourself?" she asked. I couldn't see in the dark what "you're sure of yourself" meant.</p> <p>"And I'm sure of you," I said.</p> <p>I didn't think we'd ever be back there on the sofa again, but maybe it might do better this time. I thought she just couldn't be trusted to carry a serious conversation in her bedroom, so it was just my imagination. I felt so comfortable with her again that I really was glad that she was feeling no apprehension, and was looking forward to it very, very much.</p> <p>I went around and sat in a chair by the fireplace and took out an ashtray from the ashtray on the mantelpiece. She'd just come a short time ago from the river, and all of the lovely clothes I'd helped her with, I knew she would go just that easily, so I made us another glass of brandy. "Would you like to join me here in a moment?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't know, but I can certainly feel better off in the arms of someone who's feeling the same way," she said with a big sigh. "I'm feeling a bit sleepy, and I don't want to sleep just yet." I could see a lot of promise in her eyes, and it gave me a feeling of power to use certain things with her.</p> <p>She went to the bathroom and came back with her clothes in her hand. "Here, we can change into something more comfortable for you," I suggested. She didn't even look at me, but just took off her shoes and threw them under the sofaâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
