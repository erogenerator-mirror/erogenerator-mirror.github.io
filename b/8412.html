You just do what feels natural," she said as she leaned back, stretching and her breasts fell proudly under her arms and her legs were shaking as she looked at him.</p> <p>Johnnie shook his head slightly so not to say anything.</p> <p>"Come back here," she said, "and see how it feels for me to be your wife."</p> <p>Johnnie smiled, climbed up on the bed to where she was looking at him and straddled his stomach facing over towards her, and began stroking his cock and feeling her breasts over her stomach.</p> <p>She moaned when he brushed her lips with his lips, then his lips, and he kissed her deeply as he slowly pushed his tongue into her mouth.</p> <p>She pushed herself back into him and began grinding her crotch against his.</p> <p>"Do you like fucking me?" she asked after they kissed each other.</p> <p>"I love it," he breathed as his hands slid over her smooth stomach and lower onto her soft rounded breasts as he continued to rub them.</p> <p>"Good!" she purred and she could feel his hot cock pressing into her, rubbing against her crotch. She began rubbing against it harder and it was then that she felt her own breasts begin to ache. The need to be touched, to cum, or to be touched again was overwhelming. Johnnie felt her hand going from his cock to the tip of it and to his balls.</p> <p>"Let me," she said, "let me suck you," as her mouth slid over his.</p> <p>She closed her eyes as she felt his cock slip into her mouth slowly. Her tongue stroking him as the tip hit the back of her throat.</p> <p>He didn't know how this would feel so he lay there as if his mind was all made of jelly.</p> <p>"You have a beautiful mouth," she said as she wrapped her lips tighter around him, her hands on his knees, pushing them up to kiss him again.</p> <p>"It is a beautiful sight," he thought as she slowly began moving her tongue over him.</p> <p>She had made a great impression on him though he had been feeling uncomfortable about it. He hadn't even said 'let her,' and he had made a few feeble attempts with her. It was all pretty much the talk and the fucking thing and she seemed to like it.</p> <p>His cock got harder and he heard her moan lightly as her mouth stroked him as she began to suck him harder and harder into her mouth.</p> <p>Johnnie's legs felt stiff as she moved from his cock to his belly, and he pushed his ass off the bed.</p> <p>"What are you doing!" Johnnie said as he struggled for control from being held tight by her.</p> <p>She grinned.</p> <p>"What would you like me to do for you?" she asked, sliding her lips up his shaft with her mouth still full, her chin against his balls.</p> <p>He couldn't think straight, and in a daze he said, "Let me suck you. Let me show you how good it can be."</p> <p>"Mmmmmm!" she moaned as she pressed forward.</p> <p>"I would like you to suck me. Mmmm!" he moaned.</p> <p>She was looking at his throbbing cock as she slid her tongue along the tip. The taste was not at all unpleasant, and he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of just tasting him.</p> <p>She held the tip between her lips and stroked the shaft, watching the veins bulging a little as they jumped and she sucked his cock.</p> <p>"It tastes so good," she said to him, "I love it."</p> <p>She could feel him tense and he slid back a little.</p> <p>"It feels nice," he groaned, and she smiled as she moved her head up and down the shaft.</p> <p>"Is that a hard cock?" she asked as she sucked him faster. "Is it going to shoot a big load?"</p> <p>"Yes!" he said as his hips rose up against her face, and he reached down to hold her head.</p> <p>Then he was cumming.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, oh!" he moaned as his cock swelled and began to spurt.</p> <p>He came in thick, creamy jets that seemed to go on forever, and she took them into her mouth before she released his cock as it slipped out.</p> <p>"That looks great," she said, "and it's a load."</p> <p>She smiled. Johnnie had been trying to tell her how good it was, and to keep it simple, but he had been afraid she would stop, and that would make him feel better.</p> <p>He had had enough, and he lifted himself onto his elbows to look into her eyes as she swallowed the first mouthful of cum.</p> <p>"You're amazingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
