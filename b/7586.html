Or at least I don't think that's going to happen now either.</p> <p>You, the love/reliance, that's just about the most amazing thing I've ever heard. I'm not sure I want to say anything more.</p> <p>After all, this is a relationship. I've had all sorts of fun with that, but I'm not really in the mood to spoil it. If you feel at all angry or jealous or angry then that's the first thing you need to do... take it, and stop worrying about it. Or... just... take it... and stay with it. "Thanks."</p> <p>The end of her first question seemed to snap me back into reality. I looked at her and I felt like there was something wrong with her. I was starting to become very worried but at the same time, I didn't feel totally in control. This girl had the body of a goddess, that body that could be worshiped, loved, and adored by every male on her planet. I felt like my heart was going to burst... if I didn't do something, I wouldn't care.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry for the way the world has gone with us, Sarah." I said it out loud.</p> <p>I wasn't sure that was a good response but I didn't want to make it any worse than it was. I guess I was really in shock.</p> <p>"I am not." I said the first sentence out of either of our mouths because that wasn't how it should have sounded right then, but the words just felt hollow and hurtful.</p> <p>"Don't you have someone else coming to stay with you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well... a couple..." I stumbled as fast as I could.</p> <p>She leaned forward and whispered in my ear...</p> <p>"I love you... but only for a little while."</p> <p>There, I said it. I was done. This wasn't my decision. This is the woman, my own little Sarah. If not for the fact she'd have a boyfriend, I don't know what I'd do. Maybe I'd stay with her for awhile if I loved those guys who really wanted to take advantage of her...</p> <p>I don't know. After all, I did have sex with a pretty girl. So why now?</p> <p>"Well, let's just try to work past that and get back on track in one piece."</p> <p>She smiled that beautiful smile again and her eyes were like pools of gold. I couldn't help but think, I just might just marry that girl.</p> <p>"I'm not sure we can get back to where we were." I finally said as I pulled away from her. She gave her best smile of the entire trip back to Boston.</p> <p>"You're right. I'm not sure either. I still don't know what this place is yet. It's not a big city anymore."</p> <p>"I'm not a city. I live in the city." I said it so matter-of-factly it set a tone that she was more than happy to hear. I could feel her anger at me as I made my way back up the stairs to my apartment building. It wasn't as if I was talking with an ordinary guy... I mean, when you were trying to act like you were happy to have someone that loved you, that you really loved, you just weren't trying to get rid of yourself. There was something there that I was missing in that moment, at least in my mind if not in my heart.</p> <p>I knew I couldn't tell her how much I loved her. There wouldn't be anything to say for sure, and I didn't know what to tell her until it all really hit me. That simple statement that I'd just made, not two hours ago. Just a few words like that. I still wanted to keep things going, we just had things to be talked about later. "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"You have no idea what you did to me..." She began, but I interrupted her with.</p> <p>"Stop lying me Sarah." I felt my rage coming back. "Just shut up... and do it again."</p> <p>She slowly walked from her spot on that long, long hallway, over toward me. It didn't look very far into the distance, perhaps 10 or 15 steps. If she saw me looking at her the way she was looking at me, she probably would have run. I knew that my heart didn't belong to her, but that same feeling wouldn't subside. "But... you're my girlfriend. We can't just just keep having meaningless sex. It would be dangerous."</p> <p>Her eyes began to glisten. She didn't want to just walkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
