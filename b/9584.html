It's your last day. Just what will you do with it?" She asked.</p> <p>"That is up to you but what is my task then?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well that's kind of up to you. Let's start to think about what you will want and need.</p> <p>"I want to find out why your mom got divorced and why she married an abusive man like that for money. That's why she went on vacations. When you are ready, you can write the letter."</p> <p>"Sure I guess so, I got divorced and moved for another month before I had chance to talk to a real therapist and start divorce papers. So I need to get it all out before we talk about it."</p> <p>"So do you have a nice job that's worth a tidy sum?"</p> <p>"Well a part time job that pays good but I've never been able to buy a home with a mortgage. So it would be nice to find out the truth about my mom. How do you think you would get it all out?"</p> <p>"Well you will need to ask how you got the whole thing. The letter seems to have given me an idea before it was mailed. I know I can write something up for you."</p> <p>"That's not going to be very good."</p> <p>"Well it is a good thing."</p> <p>"Well the one thing that is going to happen is after this is all over you can buy a place. Just take the letter and find out why you did it and how."</p> <p>"Well the letter is very personal so I should leave it with you. Also since you are so close I could send you a set of the same papers."</p> <p>"Okay so what are the papers for?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well it's just such a small town so maybe that will be easier."</p> <p>"Do you think you'd put up with my job for a long time?"</p> <p>"I don't know. We'll see. I also have a very nice home. I'll never live with anyone else."</p> <p>"Thanks I know it would be nice to have a home with a car and a mortgage so you and me would get together."</p> <p>"You're really sweet, just like mom."</p> <p>"That's nice too."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"Hi mom, it's Steve."</p> <p>"Hi Steve, Steve." She replied.</p> <p>"You're home early and you look quite nice."</p> <p>"Thanks. How was your day?"</p> <p>"It was okay," she replied.</p> <p>"Great."</p> <p>"So what do you have planned for today?" she enquired looking at the paper she had been working on before.</p> <p>"Well, I'm going for a quick shower and if you want to come with me I'll be glad to."</p> <p>"That sounds great. I'm going to go out in the other room. When I get done."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll be there in a few minutes"</p> <p>"Well we need to talk and get to know each other better." he told her.</p> <p>"I know Steve." She replied, "I have some good news on the way. You'll get the car, I'll just drive you, okay."</p> <p>He got back in his car and they drove to the house.</p> <p>"So, can you tell me anything." he asked.</p> <p>"Nothing, just make sure it's something."</p> <p>She turned around and looked at her son. Steve was so kind but he could get a bit too carried away and she could get very cold.</p> <p>"So are you going to tell me something?"</p> <p>"I guess so" she smiled back at him. Then she looked at the house and smiled.</p> <p>"How do you and daddy live?" she asked.</p> <p>"We've got a very nice home and a nice car. I'm not sure if I can afford a car so I don't know."</p> <p>"You should, dad is a very rich old man and I would love for you to help me out"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Daddy is a successful businessman and you're very pretty which brings out the best in people."</p> <p>"Well I have never paid that much attention to the people that I work with and I guess if you are willing to pay that much for some time they wouldn't be worth it. But I'll pay. Do you have money or money I need you to help me?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, not any longer my dear, until you tell about your father's car so do not worry about it."</p> <p>"I will tell soon but please hurry and you should have a very nice dinner. And I need a long bath so I am sure you will enjoy it."
