Why had she put it that way? He didn't notice that her leg had drawn up, and he couldn't see a damned thing.</p> <p>"Mom, I don't understand what's going on!"</p> <p>She looked at him and smiled. "We don't have to say much either, son, but we are glad you came home."</p> <p>"We...we're home, we are home".</p> <p>He didn't know which of them had come home that night. Of course it hadn't been her son, except for when he was younger, of course. He had been home for two weeks and his mother wasn't home. He wasn't sure if he'd have noticed though. He had a very long way to go before he'd understand why his mother, her real mother was pregnant with the child she'd had when he was born. Now that that was done, there was another problem.</p> <p>He stood there dumb founded. The way she looked at him, had he been a virgin before? His mother had taken his virginity, and he thought that was all that a son should know.</p> <p>She wasn't angry at him. He could tell immediately by the look on his face she hadn't been expecting him to be so excited and turned on by the pregnancy. It hadn't had much to do with the fact that she'd seen him naked, as opposed to a teenager. No, he realized, she'd been excited seeing him, just not the way she expected. The look in her eyes that came over her when he'd taken her in her bedroom was that other way, too, and that wasn't what had made her so upset. If that was the case at all, he couldn't blame her. He just hoped she could see out.</p> <p>"No, you don't understand," she said. "A couple of months, we'll talk it out and make arrangements and, maybe, you can stay, and, no, I won't go away, alright? This is your home, you're my son, not some little girl." She looked at him, and he saw how hurt she was, but his heart pounded in his chest. She never looked at him then. Only when he had taken her in her living room. "You don't want to stay here!"</p> <p>"If you mean because I want to," he asked her, "what makes you say it?"</p> <p>She took a deep breath. "Because it's the only way we'll be together again." He could tell by her tone, that it was the truth.</p> <p>"Mom," he said, "are you sure this isn't for me or any other reason? I mean I want it to be you I'm taking this time to give you my baby, not some stupid teen. I've never felt this way before. Can you help me understand it? I want everything to be perfect and everything I ever wanted. Yes, I want us to be friends. I want to be a part of you and your life."</p> <p>"I know," she replied, a smile across her face. "But if it means I have to give your friend a discount of a month at least, just so he knows he's buying his best friend's mother a pregnancy test, I don't see why I should give anything away."</p> <p>She let the smile leave her face, and he was shocked at what his mother was saying. Had she known how much she had helped him at a young age? She just said he had gotten an A in his math and math science class, that he was a senior. It didn't make any sense at all. What made it sense, was his mother giving him a discount of an month at least, as opposed to an item. Did she even know he had a date? He looked at her, and as he did, his eyes grew larger and he thought his face turned even more angry. That was what had got out in the first place, just because of him. He couldn't deal with his mother treating him like that, even though he had agreed to stay, and that made this all worse. Did he want to live with her, while she treated him like a child? It was something he hadn't really thought of. It was like he got mixed up in some bad movie.</p> <p>His mother looked at him for a long while, and then got up to leave, walking away from him when she thought he wasn't coming in. She was just getting changed while he turned the doorknob. When she put something back on, she looked back at him again and shook her head. "Leave his wife alone, son. Don't mess with her, don't mess with him, don't mess with me, I don't come home," she said and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
