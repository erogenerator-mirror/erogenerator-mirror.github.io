I assured her, not really wanting to go on the offensive.</p> <p>"It didn't seem like you wanted to talk...too much time to think. You seem nervous about it." She asked, clearly.</p> <p>"I'm nervous too..." I tried to reassure her.</p> <p>"Well..." she paused and added a bit of a snide remark to her comments before she got around to her next words. "I won't tell your father not to knock for a change...he didn't have to have his dick in his hands to feel good, and he made me feel pretty. It's not like you get to just feel good...or make yourself feel good...in a bad way." She went on, and after a full fifteen seconds she asked "Are you...you're nervous?"</p> <p>"Uh...yes."</p> <p>"No?" she asked, clearly surprised.</p> <p>"No...yes." I whispered back.</p> <p>"Well, you probably didn't think that...that you wouldn't be making me feel good with your mouth and your big prick..." she leaned forward, putting a hand to my chin to stop my protest.</p> <p>I wasn't at all thrilled she'd find out of my thoughts of being with another man. At least that much was true...with me...not some...some guy who she met while going to a club...or dancing...but this...an older man who she knew.</p> <p>"No...I...I like that..." I was caught, again. She leaned against me, her breasts pressed close to my chin. She was clearly aroused, and I wasn't sure if she was even breathing.</p> <p>"I'm not that kind of guy either." she admitted as she moved her legs apart and moved her arms up around my neck. One hand stroked my hair and the other went to my hip, her hand on my butt.</p> <p>"You're a beautiful, young, strong, well-built man...what do you say...you're not a stranger..." She murmured, kissing the side of my neck.</p> <p>I didn't know what to say, so I leaned back against the couch, looking at her, and slowly, we started to undress each other.</p> <p>"Are you sure...I...I mean...we can do this...I just...need to...not...understand...a lot..." I said.</p> <p>"What?" she asked, surprised.</p> <p>"We'll figure it out someday...I want you...I want to feel you...to...to feel the things I have in my...in my...in my...in my..." I said, and suddenly her hand moved from my shoulder to my side...her fingers traced around my back...then around my butt. She seemed a bit surprised...maybe...I'm not sure. But whatever the reason, I couldn't take my eyes off her, and the sensation of her fingertips caressing me in places I couldn't have imagined.</p> <p>"Come closer...let me feel you under my arm." She said as she leaned in and put her head against my shoulder. Her body was warm...so warm, and very, very soft.</p> <p>As I reached out and rested my hand on her back under the fabric of the tank top, she gave me a kiss that was very close to my lips. I let my hand rest there, with just the tips of my fingers just caressing her skin, her neck, and her collar bone. She smelled like...it was a mixture between soap and pine scented perfume. She didn't seem to mind, if this was how a good kiss should be.</p> <p>I let my fingers wander to her sides, as I felt her soft skin, and then down to her ass, feeling just how firm and smooth it was. It was warm...and she had the softest skin under her skin...how perfect...but so slightly...perfect. I pulled away from her and started to remove her tank top as I slipped the shirt over her head and off her shoulders. My face was so close to hers...and our lips were just an inch of distance from touching. She pulled my shirt out of my pants and I let hers follow it with the shirt.</p> <p>My fingertips slid under the bottom part of her tank top, and I could feel her bare skin, as if she was just bare...just like I was when she came out of a club, wearing nothing under her uniform. I could feel her shiver just a bit, but wasn't sure if she was cold.</p> <p>It didn't bother me one bit to pull her panties down, just an inch of fabric, and just the tip of my finger went under the fabric and up to her lips, just to find something that seemed as small as a button, just aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
