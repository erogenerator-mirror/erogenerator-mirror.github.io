"I don't want you to get upset," she explained.</p> <p>I nodded, not trusting her as she'd made a mistake and had probably hurt my feelings. She wasn't that good in this area, she wasn't that sweet, the best kind to be. Besides, I had to admit that she was one of the sexiest women that was in the world. That had always made me a bit nervous until she'd started with her "lover", but now I relaxed my guard and smiled as she started to slowly grind her hips in a lazy circle, looking down at my hand as I gripped her waist.</p> <p>I let go of her hair to pull her closer and she ground harder, biting her lip softly. We were getting away with a mess, and I was not about to let her go back to bed. She had just made the mistake of making light of everything. So we did just that. She pulled my hand a little tighter. "This is the second time," she purred as she pressed my knuckles against her stomach. Her whole body moved slightly as if to move and I took that as a good sign.</p> <p>"Not bad," I smiled, reaching down and taking her soft breast in my hand. "Not bad at all - but not bad, either." "I've just never really had a partner that could do this," she said. She leaned into my chest and pressed her hips into mine. "I mean, I've done this before, but I never thought it would be this quick. I guess you could call me slow, but maybe not, "she said, pulling a little closer and pressing my body into hers. I could feel the warmth of her body rubbing back against mine even through her clothes. "You feel so warm," I said.</p> <p>"Nice," she sighed. "Thank-you. You keep touching me - I feel like it's going to be all the time," she smiled and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>I leaned into her, our bodies pressing together. I kissed her soft lips, enjoying how full and wet they were. She broke the kiss, pulling back a little so I could glance down at her exposed stomach. Our eyes met. "You want me to sit back down? Or should I try to get you on your back?" She said, pushing her body away from mine.</p> <p>"I'll lie back on you in no time. It'll be nice to be able to watch you and feel you in me. It wasn't like, last time with Steve..."</p> <p>"He's too shy," she said, pulling herself back in to me. "I haven't been with another man for a long time," she said and pushed my hands to my sides. "Not just with Steve."</p> <p>"It's complicated," I said.</p> <p>She looked away for a second, then started to move in the opposite direction to me on the sofa. I had a little time before she stopped, her back to me. I kissed her neck as she got on her knees and straddled my legs. "I think this is the time that I'm really going to start enjoying you, aren't I?" she asked, looking up at me with her wide, brown eyes.</p> <p>"Yeah, but it doesn't leave me the same empty feeling as with Steve," I said, moving my hands to her waist and pulling her down to me. She moved back a little, then looked up at me. "Are you sure you want this, too?"</p> <p>In answer, I bent my head and kissed her as a girl takes to someone from afar. Her lips were sweet, her tongue was smooth and strong. I slid my hands up her long, toned stomach, her hips and her breasts. Her large nipples were hard on there and I sucked on her breasts, biting them a little. She moaned a little as I did this, and pushed her hips down slowly so I could take some of the weight off my own thighs. "Oh, God, that feels so good," she gasped as I pulled her hips down so my dick rested against the bottom of her pussy and pushed into her wetness.</p> <p>Her breathing was ragged and she started bouncing a little on my dick. "You're so... big," she said, smiling. "I've never felt it so big in my...." she trailed off as I started to thrust my hips up into her. "I'm going to... just go slow, ok?" she said as she started to move again around me. I slid my hands to her breasts, feeling her breasts, enjoying them and their weight. I rubbed my thumbs across her nipples for a while, then slid my hands up to touch her stomach. I felt her breathing change. "God, you feel goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
