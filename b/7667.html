We still talk about our sexual experiences but no more. This is just my opinion, if it is okay with you or not. You have a great sex life with your ex and there is nothing wrong with that. So long as you respect that decision and don't push it.</p> <p>If you like our story and feel like writing a story based on it, then I would love to have you read this story if you didn't like it. (Or just thought it was sexy so don't take anything that is not yours with it. If I could be in your shoes, then I would be very happy to write it.</p> <p>I always want to hear from you my dear and I am sorry if either of us has been short in the comments, let me know how it goes!!</p> <p>All characters in the story are 18 years or older. (Read 'A Day in the Life' for details)</p> <p>*****</p> <p>She was in the middle of her bath getting off when I walk into the room with my cock throbbing and a wet spot on my pants. "Baby you can't go there again I have a date for tonight."</p> <p>"Oh I will, let me get dressed and I will see you later. Oh what I would like to do before I go to get ready."</p> <p>"Nonsense sweetie, I will make it up to you when I get back so get dressed I am going to run to the store and get some things and meet this gentleman down in the mall."</p> <p>"OK, I will see you in a few minutes then."</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and cleaned myself up then went to our living room. I saw Jessica sitting on the sofa taking it in. She had on a light white shirt that came down to mid-thigh, she had on a pair of red high heel shoes that looked like something a girl would wear for church on Sunday. Her bare midriff was showing off her beautiful breasts underneath. Her skirt was about three inches shorter than her normal height and was tight against her soft thighs. She had on a pair of brown slippers that went down to her knees and the top of her knees were showing, but it was covered by her dress which she had put her skirt through. The hemline of her skirt ended just above her pink slip. We sat on the corner of the couch as she looked in the front door. Her arms were crossed across her chest and she was leaning to the side looking at us intently.</p> <p>"So have you decided yet how we will approach this young man? I know you are not having sex with him and I do understand but we must decide if I should get married."</p> <p>"No honey, he isn't that young. He is just a man, but we decided to settle this matter over you instead of us."</p> <p>"And you will get the chance to talk to him, is that right honey?"</p> <p>"Mmm hmm"</p> <p>"That's right, he is an old friend and he could teach some how to teach. Let me get you something to drink."</p> <p>"Scotch on the rocks, it's almost 7:30, is there anything else?"</p> <p>"Yeah, your choice sweetheart. It'll be my pleasure."</p> <p>"That's good; he will be able to teach you what you wanted to know. There's something else, there is a piece of equipment I've picked up by the way."</p> <p>She picked up a small black object and held it up in front of us. "Baby is this a vibrator or a dildo?"</p> <p>"Oh my God! That's something I've thought of for years."</p> <p>"Are you sure your husband wouldn't mind teaching you this little thing."</p> <p>"Why do you have that on, I'll get it."</p> <p>"Don't get mad, that's an accessory for when he teaches, it's the one I want you to see. He has a little device that will turn one's body on or off and be used as a quick way to take care of your needs."</p> <p>"What is that little thing thing?"</p> <p>She paused for a moment to think. "Oh, that's a cock ring. It's just something he uses when he wants to get your husband to do things he enjoys. I think he wants me to wear it, when you need to fuck me."</p> <p>"So when I want him to have sex with you, will it get you off? I don't want him to use it on me,"</p> <p>"Oh, I will help him to teach you how to use it on him"</p> <p>She smiled and went to get our wine. She handed me the box of sex stuff and came back a minute later. She had sat down again. "That was so hot baby.
