Don't you wish we could have done this a few more times? You have a perfect body to go with it" he said.</p> <p>"And my breasts are so firm, that it wouldn't hurt for me to get aroused."</p> <p>"Amen. You won't mind if I touch them, will you?"</p> <p>"No, I guess I'd like to," I said smiling. "Let's go."</p> <p>We quickly walked around the corner of her bed to the bathroom of her bedroom. I could feel the cold water run down my back as she grabbed her breasts through her thin white top and pulled it up. I grabbed my throbbing cock and helped her to step into the hot flow of water. The thought made me jump, my cock sliding up and down.</p> <p>"What do I do, pull her panties off and take them off?" she wondered.</p> <p>"Nonsense," I said stepping closer to her. "We're just having fun. I'm not going to take any harm from you. Now, sit down here"</p> <p>She leaned back at my request and pulled off her damp panties and tucked them into her mouth.</p> <p>"There, you can go ahead and let me rinse off." With that she picked off my shirt and we quickly washed each other. We stepped back from the bathroom and began to dry each other off and then walked back into the bedroom to find towels. After drying each other off with the towels and helping her dry her hair, we went back over to her bed and sat down side by side, kissing and exploring each other mouth.</p> <p>A few strokes of our mouths and I felt her tongue slide against my lips. It was hot and hungry. I felt her hand grab a hand full of my thigh and squeeze down as she slid a finger between my lips. She slid into my mouth like an experienced, and I was amazed that she could find my tongue.</p> <p>"So soft," she whispered. "No, I mean it."</p> <p>I reached over her shoulders and grabbed a hold of her bra with both hands. I ripped the straps off her shoulders.</p> <p>"No, you've got one wrong," I teased. I pulled at her bra and she squealed in laughter, and then held on tight to me.</p> <p>I reached out and gently stroked her bra straps off her shoulders, the bra falling away. I slowly and gently pulled the straps off her arm and I kissed the tops of her beautiful breasts. I kissed them a few times as gently as I could.</p> <p>"Now put your hands on mine," I said gently. "Kiss them, make them feel good."</p> <p>I could only lightly kiss each breast as I lifted my hands on hers. She reached out and touched the sides of my face and neck as I kissed her. Her hand reached down to my cock and she began to stroke it up and down the length of my shaft. I broke our kiss and slowly reached my hands inside her bra, my fingers finding her breasts in the cup.</p> <p>"No, you can't just touch them," I cautioned.</p> <p>"There's got to be another way, maybe one way for you," she said with a mischievous grin.</p> <p>With that she picked up the bra off the bed and tossed it to the floor, her head dropped between my legs again taking my throbbing cock back into her mouth.</p> <p>I felt the walls of her warm mouth slide up and down me, making me want it, and I slid my hands down her body to her ass, feeling the soft skin as I pulled her off my cock. I took a second to admire her beautiful body with her hard nipples, her firm breasts, her flat stomach, and the sweet pussy I had just fucked. I pushed her back onto the bed with her legs open and her pussy in the air, wanting it. I lowered myself towards her.</p> <p>"No," she gasped. "Not here. I want to be fucked, not have to do this." Her legs clamped round my body and her fingers dug into my back.</p> <p>Her words, her hot mouth, and the intense heat of her arousal made me realize she wanted me to fuck her in a way I didn't even remember. I pushed myself down to her waiting lips, kissing her and tonguing her, her passion like fire at the start of it, taking her.</p> <p>"Don't stop," she urged me on, pushing me down onto her thighs, kissing me and then her face as our lips finally came to a rest. We kissed each other lovingly, gently squeezing each other's breasts as our breathing slowly returned to normal.</p> <p>"That was great," I said between kissesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
