I yelled, making her stop.</p> <p>Her hand stopped me again. "What's the matter Jack?" she asked. "Why did you put that on?"</p> <p>"Your eyes are red from crying," I said. "Wouldn't you care to feel it?"</p> <p>"But... what about your tits, I'm not sure they're real like these?" she said. "And how is it so hard to explain that!" she squealed. I just chuckled and started rubbing her tit.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh, yeah! That's much too rough. Please don't hurt me. I'm all red."</p> <p>"I'm just trying to help you, just try and go with the flow. If you let me, we'd probably be able to make you feel better."</p> <p>With that I started gently massaging her other tit.</p> <p>"If you try and stop me, I'll call the police."</p> <p>"No, we can't."</p> <p>"Yes, we can."</p> <p>I stopped rubbing her tits for just a second and kissed them. "Let's get you dressed," I said.</p> <p>"Let's! Let's go!" She grabbed her dress back on and then we started on her makeup. For that it was the most revealing dress I owned. It was a one piece, made of a soft fabric material. The sleeves came up to just above her elbow as was my usual attire. It had a high neck collar that kept it low.</p> <p>It was a short sleeved, almost transparent-looking dress that was buttoned from the bottom to the top. The top ended mid-calf and was tied together by a string that went around her neck. It looked very sexy in this light summer dress.</p> <p>"Come on, let's go!" I said, taking her shoulders, "I'm sorry, are you sure it's okay?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, Jack no-no. You should see how it feels in my dress!"</p> <p>She followed me out to the car. The front of her dress was still slightly damp.</p> <p>"I want to see the cab driver's face when I hit your heel," I said, "and don't be too hard about it, ok?"</p> <p>"Whatever you say," she said and we both burst out laughing.</p> <p>We drove off and walked the block, with me turning on lights so she could be on the lookout. A few blocks later.</p> <p>"Do you live closer to home?" she asked. We walked inside, got a drink, and settled in the living room.</p> <p>We settled down as I turned on the radio. While she was watching I put the stereo off. We started dancing again. There wasn't anything like a slow song with her rubbing my hand on her leg. She must have read the mood in my eyes and knew I liked it. I moved my hand to her leg and rubbed against her soft thigh.</p> <p>"I can't believe you do this to me!"</p> <p>"Me neither!" I said, "it feels better when you're hot!"</p> <p>"How many men in the world has seen my legs like that? Did you have more fun doing your sister with that dress?"</p> <p>"I can't believe you're saying that!"</p> <p>She just blushed lightly and grabbed my hands.</p> <p>"Would you come home?" I asked.</p> <p>"I've been dreaming of this for a long time!"</p> <p>"I can't wait! But, I don't like this."</p> <p>She just stared at me. I felt guilty telling her this, but, it wouldn't have gone any better with the way she looked at me.</p> <p>"Ok," I said and started to walk toward her.</p> <p>"Jack, you've got to be kidding!"</p> <p>"What does it look like for you?" I asked, stopping in front of my wife.</p> <p>"This looks a bit like a dance!" she said.</p> <p>I walked up to her and put both hands on her face.</p> <p>"You can have it any time, and whenever you want," I said in her ear, "No one is going to judge you for you!"</p> <p>Smiling, she let me put my hand back on her mouth.</p> <p>"What are you going to do, you know what to do," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"You've wanted this for so long, haven't you?" I said, knowing how much she liked me talking dirty.</p> <p>"I want to be ready for this!" she said, putting her hands on my shoulders and trying hard to put my hand onto her pussy.</p> <p>We continued to talk to each other as she rubbed my fingers between her legs. Then we started kissing and then she had to put my hand toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
