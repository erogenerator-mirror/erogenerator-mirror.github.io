Although we had met, I did not really know the person who took the control and was so taken by my helplessness that I had to choose between either it or the stranger.</p> <p>I was a good girl when we first met at my first college and when I returned home with all of the money that I had spent for the apartment in the city, my friend and roommate had invited me to stay. While we all seemed to share the same values, there was the awkwardness of having to ask permission to leave our house to go to school. When I thought about it, my roommate said that I could leave the city permanently if I wanted to, with the help of the new landlord.</p> <p>He knew that I hadn't been with him before and that it would not be my last chance to see him and was more than willing to help. Before we knew it, I was standing in his kitchen with nothing but his jacket in my hand and we were standing together on his front porch with his hand on the small of my back. I thought that the awkwardness of having to go to school without any clothes was probably why he had invited me and I felt guilty thinking about it.</p> <p>To keep myself in line with the school spirit, I chose that moment to go to a restaurant. I sat in the chair across from where my roommate had been and I realized that I was hungry and thirsty. I had no appetite, so I told my roommate I would get us some fruit juice when I went back to my apartment to watch TV. I went in search of a restaurant that I knew, of course, but I did not know what it was called and never found it. I was afraid that I might walk right into the restaurant and get drunk without being allowed back home.</p> <p>So I had to make a decision on whether or not to go with him. I could go with him. I went to the grocery store for some food and I found a grocery store that I knew of that we could get a purchase quickly and make something like food if we wished. I sat in the food court and ate my food ravenously, trying to be as normal as possible. I had just finished my shopping when a young man came to the counter and picked up my bag. He made a sign with his hand that he wished me a good evening.</p> <p>"My name is Robert, it is nice to meet you. I see you have some fruit juice in your bag to finish." He smiled at me with a smile that reminded me a little of the smile that I had come to recognize as the one that most people on campus would give to a pet while being held down in bed. It was like a little girl staring at her daddy, waiting to be fed. I did not think that the smile could convey that in any way and I felt nervous for I was so used to that man.</p> <p>I paid for the food and took the bag into the apartment to clean up. I was hoping that this strange man wanted me to go back to my apartment to watch TV and I felt a little awkward, like I was being asked to "work out", and was not ready for the situation to be changed yet.</p> <p>I went and sat on the bed and tried to figure out how to deal with this strange man. I had never seen a guy like him in my life, not even when I was with my ex. I had seen lots of guys in my classes and I knew that there were very few guys with a penis that were so wide it would almost look like he was going to be splitting them in half without effort to get it inside. I realized how much it was embarrassing to be a girl in a situation like this and the feelings I had to suppress from being a girl were so alien to me that I found myself feeling uncomfortable being around a stranger. I told myself that I would be a girl and that I was going to go out and meet a stranger at a bar for a few drinks on Sunday night.</p> <p>I sat down on the bed and made myself a sandwich while I waited. I felt guilty for not eating a little when I ate, feeling like I was being used for some sexual pleasure and I wondered briefly if I was really a guy if this could be a real thing as I found myself wondering about how it would feel to have a man in the room. I was almost about to call a taxi when I felt someone come into the room beside me. I looked up and saw that it was Bill.</p> <p>He put his hand on my shoulder and looked at it for a moment before asking me what I did here and how it would take me to meet him. I had told him that I would be back with my girlfriend of some time and he asked me if I wanted to talk privately until I was ready. I told him that I wouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
