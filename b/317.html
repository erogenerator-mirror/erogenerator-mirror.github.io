She was now feeling quite hot, and the cool towel felt wonderful against her warm skin. She sat down on the edge of the bed, and pulled her robe together.</p> <p>"So, how are you two feeling?" His voice had a sardonic tone to it that didn't sound like him. No, he wasn't going to just come to her like that either.</p> <p>"Tired, but, I'm sorry I didn't come sooner." Sonia shook her head, "But I don't mind the massage you gave me, I'm really feeling very relaxed. I'm happy to do this, it's just been a wonderful evening. If you feel the same about me, just tell me," she said, holding the end of the robe in one hand.</p> <p>"It's no problem, I think you'll enjoy it. Is it something I can do for you, maybe you can do for me?" The look on his face was priceless. He didn't even seem able to form enough words to speak.</p> <p>"Well, I think maybe your eyes are burning into me, please don't be embarrassed, it's quite flattering really, that's why I like to do this." Sonia had to pull her hand from its position. "I'm not normally like this, but, you know I'm not very shy, and..." he was cut off by the waiter walking by their table.</p> <p>"No, no, stay, please. That's all right. I'm not asking too much, just that you should sit down. There, your turn to massage me down. I would really like to see what you can do.</p> <p>"You know the waiter doesn't like to wait."</p> <p>"Of course, of course." She took her robe off, and sat down. He moved closer, and leaned down to kiss her. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders, her tongue exploring his mouth. He kissed her passionately. His hands slid down her front, until he found her breasts. They were warm, slightly swollen, and he felt them rise towards his fingers as he rubbed them across her chest. He could feel her nipples become hard under his fingers, and as she moaned with pleasure he bit her cheek a little.</p> <p>His cock was pressing urgently against the fabric of his jeans, and at this juncture he was afraid he would come right there in his room. He broke away, letting Sonia breathe deeply, and sat up a little.</p> <p>"So, what's on your mind?" he asked, his voice hoarse, full of desire.</p> <p>'Yes," she said, smiling, "well, I was thinking about how to thank you. Is this any real way of thanking you for all your hospitality?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he said, "I guess I've always been a lucky man to be able to be your...servant." That's what the waiter had said. "Mia, I never would have thought it possible for me to actually say that, but, well I think you ought to give your boss a piece of your mind. He needs to relax."</p> <p>"I suppose," Mia said, smiling at him, "maybe it's a little too soon for you for my taste, you know?"</p> <p>"Honey, I've never had a girl let me massage her down before," he laughed, "and how are the rules to having friends over?" He laughed at that too.</p> <p>"Well," Sonia smiled, leaning over and taking him in her hands, "I guess we won last a little while." She reached down for his zipper, and very slowly pulled it down.</p> <p>"Oh, you can take this off, you know." He removed his shirt and his socks, letting them slide down his body. Sonia pulled his pants completely off, and took his cock in her hand. She stroked ever so slightly, and was rewarded with a gasp when he came free. It was still pretty hard, and she knew she had to have him. She knelt down between his legs, leaned forwards, and took his head in her mouth. She could taste his own pre-come and the sweetness of his pre-cum. He tasted so good, so masculine. She wanted to suck him so badly and to bury her head between his legs and to feel him in her mouth. She slid his cock out of her hands, kissed the head, and licked it from the bottom out. She could see the blood pulsing down his cock, and she ran her tongue up the sides, back down again, to the tip. She licked this way a few times, making soft little sucking noises. She was rewarded with a moan and opened her mouth wider to take more in. He let her suck him for minutes, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
