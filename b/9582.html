I asked.</p> <p>I turned, my heart suddenly pounding, as my head pounded just a little faster now that I had calmed down. I glanced around.</p> <p>The guys were gone, it was late and they were all out, it made me wonder if anyone actually came back with us, I didn't know, it felt like they went out to get us and I didn't care.</p> <p>"What about you?" I asked, as I started to get up.</p> <p>"I'll see what I can do!" He answered, and then I heard his feet come off the ground and he said good-bye.</p> <p>"You going to be ok?" I asked as I turned to go.</p> <p>"Don't worry," He said, stepping closer. "The team is going to be on their feet and your safety won't be a problem. We'll be doing this to the rest of you."</p> <p>I felt my body flush and I felt so vulnerable. There was no telling what I might have done.</p> <p>I shook my head and tried to focus. It felt like there was someone in the front of the elevator. I was shaking myself and felt like a school girl in a candy store again... a school girl to be sure. I glanced back to see who was in the elevator.</p> <p>I turned back to face the wall. I leaned back against it, not even realising my fingers had closed around the wall. I stood there holding myself back as hard as possible, as my heart was pounding so loudly in my ears.</p> <p>"Fuck" I thought, but I forced myself to just hold myself for a moment, as it's not like this is a bad feeling. It's an awkward feeling to be trying to feel vulnerable again, but there was no stopping me now.</p> <p>I felt like I wanted him to push me away, "Fuck him" I thought, and he would, but that's all.</p> <p>He took my hands off my wrists, and pulled them behind my back. He tied my hands together firmly, but not tightly enough to be hurting. His hands pulled my arms back towards him, and started to push up my shirt. I felt him pulling the shirt up and over my head, but I resisted him. He pulled it down, then off my shoulders, all the while staring at my chest.</p> <p>"You okay?" He asked.</p> <p>I nodded. "I'm fine."</p> <p>He pushed my hands off my arms, and then reached over to remove the pillow that we had used last night. I grabbed it and threw it across my stomach and back as I leaned against the wall looking back at him.</p> <p>"This is my home now," He explained, "I want you to stay, just relax. No one can hurt you, and trust me"</p> <p>I looked back, trying to stay calm, but I felt as if I was going to scream from the panic that was rising in me.</p> <p>I stared at him, trying not to think what I would just do. I felt like I had lost my family. Suddenly I felt as if I was going to go back to life.</p> <p>He looked down at me and just kept looking at me. "You are going to stay, and you will, no questions." He pulled his hands towards the zipper of his pants, and he slowly started to zip it.</p> <p>I could feel my hands shaking, and then feeling his hands on mine.</p> <p>"I have to go," He replied, and pulled my hands back.</p> <p>I could feel his hands trembling, and wondered how he would take it when he had just done this.</p> <p>He had been so calm, with his hands on mine it was as if he cared about touching me.</p> <p>He pulled back and looked at me, "I'm sure it'll be ok, I can be a good father"</p> <p>"Just make it, dad" I said, feeling defeated.</p> <p>"Ok," He said, and then pushed and tugged my hands out before he finished. I felt the zipper and started to tremble.</p> <p>"I have to go," He said after looking back towards the door.</p> <p>He turned the corner and walked out of the elevator, and turned right towards me. The tears were now running down my cheek, and I still didn't know what I was feeling.</p> <p>I couldn't even get the words out.</p> <p>I knew that I should run, but I hadn't. I felt so helpless... helpless.</p> <p>My tears had stopped, but now I felt very anxious. I was thinking that even if they didn't stop they might not stop.
