So far, the first two chapters should read about as they have been, and the third chapter will be posted soon. So, let's get a read through so we don't miss anything!"</p> <p>"Hmmm...and it is more than just just a read to get through to the fifth chapter? It also means that we can get a good read on what may be missing."</p> <p>"I agree." The girls continue on with their "read through"</p> <p>Chapter Six</p> <p>We had spent a great deal of time talking about that evening. This would have to remain one of our secret topics. There were too many things that we had already shared and felt ashamed of. I agreed, and let my heart grow heavy with sadness. That evening I knew that I couldn't go the remainder of my sentence without the girls making love to me.</p> <p>I closed off the laptop in my study and set the books off the desk. As I stood in my bedroom, and picked from the empty bag my handiwork, I had a strong, deep, silent feeling inside of myself and began to wonder where the night would lead.</p> <p>I know I should have stayed in that room until morning, to find out what it was all about, but I couldn't seem to get the image of Lola out of my mind and into my head. My breathing was becoming faster and louder, and my heart was pounding against my rib cage and the sides of my breasts.</p> <p>My hand drifted down the front of my body, stopping just above my moistening mound. I slowly spread my legs apart to allow room for my fingers to roam as they traveled into my wetness. I pushed my fingertips down between my pussy lips and pulled them back up to my clitoris.</p> <p>There were two things that the girls had done before. In fact, they had made each other come, and both of them had made me come as well. They were both very experienced at this...both loved, had been with boys, and had been able to share their desires. So I allowed them to make each other climax through me. The last thing that I do to please myself was to say I liked it that either had came because there were fingers in my vagina, or because they had been caressing me with their tongues.</p> <p>Lola was in front of the door as I approached, and she looked so sexy in her tight jeans and short sleeved top, with her blonde hair in a bun. Her long legs looked so sexy and long, as her slender white arms crossed beneath her ample breasts, and her short jacket was pulled up to her navel giving her a glimpse of the tight pink shirt she was wearing.</p> <p>"What's up sweetie?" Lola said to her. "Don't you think we shouldn't talk right now about this? We have work to do, and we need to move on with the day. Besides," Lola added with a chuckle. "I need a kiss before I go." And she slid her arms around my neck, and pushed me towards her room. As she leaned forward I felt her tongue licking my lips. We stepped into her room, and her lips were very, very close. She pulled my arm and I followed her down the hallway in the darkness of her room.</p> <p>Our lips met, and our lips parted with a soft, gentle kiss. She pushed me back against the door, and pulled the top of her shirt free from its confines and began to move it over her head. We stared into each other's eyes as she tossed her shirt aside, then began unbuttoning the button on her sweater. We continued to stare as she released her lacy bra, then slowly unzipped her jeans, pulled the zipper down slowly along its length as she moved the jeans down her thighs and stepped out of them.</p> <p>All of this was so surreal; I never felt the desire to do everything at that moment. My heart pounded inside my chest and my skin felt flush and warm as she stepped out of her jeans and stepped toward me. We stared into each other's eyes as our hands fell to our waists where our hands moved over our bodies, and cupped each other as we gently explored.</p> <p>Lola had just stepped into the bathroom and was closing the door behind her when I felt my hands sliding over my skin from behind, up my sides, across my breasts, down my sides, and across my legs. We hadn't finished our kiss, and we had never had time for anything more. Even when we kissed, it was always in between the lips rather than a soft, lingering, and playful one.</p> <p>Now, at this moment, my hands were moving down Lola's soft smooth skin to the swell of her breasts, and as they reached out and covered them her tongue lightly brushed my lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
