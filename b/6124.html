It wasn't that he was always so eager to get me involved. I knew I had to try.</p> <p>"Please, please," I said softly. He took a quick glance around, and then smiled. He was starting to understand what I was begging for. This wasn't my time of day yet, I knew that. That didn't mean that I was going to give him the go-ahead to do this. This wasn't what was the last thing on his mind, if ever.</p> <p>"This is a big deal, you know," he said, smiling back.</p> <p>He didn't know how to do this. But, with that thought, I felt him undoing his pajama pants. He took them down as slowly as he moved, until they fell to the floor. I could see his cock rising up against his thigh, as he kicked them off.</p> <p>"Mmm," he smiled. I stared up at the huge, swollen cock that was pulsating in front of me. His was just a bit longer than David's, and was probably not as thick but still very thick. He looked as if he couldn't stand it anymore, but I wanted more. I wanted him to see me, and I wanted him to see my body, and take the moment to stroke himself off.</p> <p>"You must be nervous," I said, taking him in my hand. He didn't say a word. He just took it in my hand, and I marveled at it. For a split second, I got embarrassed again. I was embarrassed in front of my boyfriend, in my underwear, in my life, in my own bed, with a monster cock that was about to take my virginity and have the time of my life. But what was happening to me?</p> <p>"Relax," David said, as if there was nothing going on. He stroked himself slowly. I could see the veins on his member, and then it started to show more white. And then, suddenly, it stopped. The head came almost out before he even began to slide it back into his pajamas.</p> <p>"Oh, sweetheart," I said, as if it was the first time I had ever seen him naked. "You must be ready for me, David."</p> <p>"It's a big one," he said, smiling. He grabbed the back of my head and put his hands around it. My pussy was sopping wet at this point. Slowly, he moved in and out, getting a rhythm going. It was so slow and deliberate. So slow that I could feel every vein on his cock sliding back and forth in my mouth. "Your pussy feels so good," he said.</p> <p>"Mmm..."</p> <p>"Sssssss..." he said, as if the words came out as words of passion.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and took in a long breath between sucks. I felt so very sexy. I felt very powerful and confident and completely at ease. But, he could hardly hear me. When he finally came, it was a great, long, intense blast of cum that felt as if it burst right through my body and filled me over and over. Oh God, I was going to have some serious damage done to my ass. But, all in good time, I thought. All in good time and for real. A big load for him, too. A good time. And, I was just getting started. One or both of us would be glad to use it. I really wanted that. I really wanted to feel it in my ass. And I was sooo ready.</p> <p>"Did I do something wrong?" asked David.</p> <p>"No, sweetheart. You were so sexy..." I managed to reply.</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with being sexy," he said, looking deep into my eyes. "Just a few things I should know. And...and just maybe...," he winked, then continued...</p> <p>...and maybe even the two of us...</p> <p>...maybe we could be lovers, but only as lovers.</p> <p>David looked at the bed in front of him, and then looked at me and smiled. We were both flushed with excitement. We had come this far.</p> <p>"How would you feel if we got married," I asked David. "Would we have a better life?" I was looking at him again. He had tears in his eyes. "Would we both just go our separate ways?" What a hard question to ask.</p> <p>"Yes, I would, but I'm not sure." And I mean, really.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm going to. I'm really happy with you."</p> <p>The tears started to run down his cheeks.</p> <p>"I want to marry you," David said, as ifâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
