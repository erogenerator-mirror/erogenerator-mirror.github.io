"Oh baby, you are sooo good," she groaned into his ear, and he felt her entire body shuddering under his and she leaned in and kissed him deeply, their tongues dancing as they kissed in a way that would have made it difficult for anyone else in the world to do.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, I love your tongue there ... just as much as you love mine. O God, I want to taste your pussy." She put one hand by her mouth and pulled her skirt up, exposing herself before him, one of her legs over the arm of the couch and the other bent back in a wide stance. "I want you to fuck me there, baby." He pulled her back by the hips and pushed her down, his hands on her soft, pale butt, and she looked up at him as he kissed the place the head of his cock touched, sucking his tongue lightly through the air as she raised herself on her knees as he placed his cock to the lips of her soaking cunt. "Oh baby, you are soooooo fucking hot," and she closed her eyes to enjoy the feeling of his throbbing shaft on her lips. "Oh it's so good, baby."</p> <p>Tom held himself up so he could get the head to the opening of her vagina, and when he could he pushed it forward and she let go of her own breath. "Go for it, baby ... fuck me," she pleaded, and he did. The first contact made her gasp, but she didn't move, she just let him slide into her, feeling his length slowly sinking into her warm, welcoming pussy.</p> <p>As she felt him bottom out again, she began to lift herself up and down the length of him, moving the head of his cock back and forth along the moist cleft of her vagina. They looked into each others' eyes and Tom was surprised to see a burning with pleasure in her eyes, but even more, she seemed to have a glow in her soul that he never imagined; the look she gave him gave him so much joy in its own turn. "That's so good," she breathed. "Fuck me more ... more ... oh shit, I'm close ... take me off," she said. Tom moved his hips, but she still wouldn't let him come in and said, "Stop. It's okay ... just sit there, okay." He didn't need much persuasion. His cock began to grow, feeling as if it would never be soft again. "Go on," she whispered. He sat up and began to unbutton his shirt. "I want to be naked for you so, you ... take off that shirt."</p> <p>She turned so he could peel off his shirt, and then laid down on the couch, with her legs wide apart and her crotch right in his face. With his mouth he began to kiss her thighs and belly first, moving higher. "Oh baby, you are so sexy," he said, licking her right foot before working his way to her toes. "Baby," she said, her voice strained, "please let me lie down." She had never had anyone do that before, and she was surprised at the way they were holding on to each other as they began to kiss and fondle each other as far up as they could go. "Oh god baby," she groaned as they rolled themselves onto their sides toward each other and began to explore each other's body with their mouths and hands. "Let's turn over so we can make love," Tom said, lifting her into the air and laying her back on the couch. They went at it like that for a while, with each trying to go at the other's sex harder and harder, sometimes not making it, sometimes coming in contact. "Oh, god, I love that," she squealed when he finally took his tongue and pushed it between her wet lips and began to eat her out -- all the while he was working to get her ready to come, so he could take her in.</p> <p>"Ooohhhh, aaagh, yes, yes, aaaah, oh honey, yes, yes, aaaahhhh," came her muffled cries as her own orgasm rose up within her and she felt her body spasm against his, pushing him closer as it did. Then all over again, his cock was still throbbing; he felt himself coming and couldn't resist taking his tongue away from her pussy.
