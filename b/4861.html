There is nothing there."</p> <p>When I pulled my shorts down I told her, "We better get dressed, I don't want to hear a peep."</p> <p>Just as we were headed to the kitchen she said, "I want to feel you," and as I kissed her deeply she whispered under her breath, "Don't worry babe you won't be getting any complaints."</p> <p>In the kitchen I heard her talking back to Kelly, the young wife and I were cleaning up what little was left of the breakfast we had the night before. When we finished I looked in the mirror to tell her that I could wait until morning.</p> <p>She reached into her purse and pulled out a thick, hard object, and started stroking it as she looked in the mirror. She said, "That's why it feels good baby, because it feels so good to make love, I think you'll be able to hear me when I'm fucking, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I felt her hand grip my shaft and start to stroke me, slowly at first then with urgency as I felt myself getting hard under her skillful hands. As I watched the two of them in the mirror we made a little triangle that the three of us would continue like that for several months before I found a way to get us back together.</p> <p>Kelly reached over and pulled my head down, she kissed me, and said, "If I can get you hard again, we'll have to do this again."</p> <p>"You're so bad Kelly," I said as I ran my hands over her ass as I pulled her back to me.</p> <p>She smiled, "I'd like that," and she pulled her cheeks apart and I saw her anus for the first time in person, and in my mouth I kissed and sucked the hole for all it was worth.</p> <p>Kelly pulled the cheeks apart and I ran my tongue inside her ass as she pushed back on me. My hand came around and touched her clit and as she felt me there she moaned, "I want to cum with you. Oh fuck, that feels so good."</p> <p>When I saw the little, tight ring around it and I looked at her and she turned toward me and slid my cock into her mouth, as her hand held me. She worked her lips and tongue on my shaft until she sensed that she was getting close again, then she stopped and said, "Don't cum yet lover."</p> <p>Her hand still wrapped around my cock she leaned up with the head at the entrance to her tunnel, and in the next moment I felt her start to tremble. She kissed me and looked at me with a grin as she said, "That's so nasty, but you're just the right size. I don't think I've ever cum like that before. You were right, she's tight."</p> <p>"I love you Kelly."</p> <p>We rolled together and I slid my erection into her tunnel until I came again, then we lay back on the bed and she said, "That was pretty fucking nasty. I feel like I could eat you up for dinner."</p> <p>"I don't care. In fact you should try this again."</p> <p>She laughed, "I'm not afraid of being eaten in front of my husband."</p> <p>We went back to watching the television, in her bedroom we started the next morning before we had to hit the hay.</p> <p>To Be Continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
