Each girl smiled at the guys and then the guys stood to their feet as they looked around quickly. They were about to change their mind and come back to the cabin when two men came out of the trees carrying two mugs of tea. The guys smiled as they noticed the three of them at last standing, still drinking their tea, and they nodded. The men then returned to the cabin. They had a seat in a big soft chair and each one began to chat with him while they were sitting there. It wasn't long before the next guy to be introduced to the whole scene. It didn't take the boys long to figure out who it was and they both waved to the first guy who greeted them.</p> <p>When they had settled back in the big chair, the other guy sitting there sat down. The big guy with the tea also sat down, but when they both started talking something was said. The two other guys were getting more involved in the conversation, occasionally commenting to the two girls who were standing to their left that they'd been watching the whole time. When they finished the tea the second girl came back with her tea tray and began to empty it as she spoke. She smiled when she saw the two men who had arrived.</p> <p>"So this is it for today," she spoke to the man sitting next to her as he raised his glass. "You're going to come with us to the cabin?"</p> <p>"Yeah, but first, there's a little more in the room," he replied. "We'll be waiting for anyone who wants to join them." The man looked a little shocked at that, but he nodded his approval.</p> <p>When the first boy came back with the tray of tea, he saw that all the other girls had returned with it. He looked around at the cabin, then back at the other girls.</p> <p>"So we're going to go out to the hot tub. There's nothing here that we want you to touch, but we'll be waiting for you."</p> <p>"Okay, I want to touch you. But let's get naked first." The boy smiled at the request. "That sounds fair, but what do we wait for?"</p> <p>"If I touch you, you'll touch me," the boy said. The other boy smiled and sat down by the girl who was talking to him. "If you want to feel my cock, it's my pleasure," the boy said to the girl sitting next to him. It seemed pretty obvious that the two boys were all for it, even though they weren't actually involved in anything in the room right then.</p> <p>"Alright," said the girl. "We'll follow you out. I'll wait by the hot tub." They stood to their feet, walking ahead of the girl and the boys towards the two girls.</p> <p>"Where do we go?" the boy with the tea tray asked. "You guys coming in the hot tub or just sitting down?"</p> <p>"Both," the girl answered. "Why don't you just go ahead and let us get under the hot tub." He pointed towards the hot tub. They both stood up, waiting for the girls to come towards them. The other boy came up to the girl, still staring.</p> <p>"Do you think we've got time to play with each other while we wait for the other girl to finish her tea?" He asked.</p> <p>"We'll just play a little game," the girl replied. There was a pause. "If you are satisfied that we're still here, you won't be able to touch each other. If you want to touch each other, just go ahead and do it."</p> <p>The two boys shook their heads when they heard what the girl was saying. They would play this game again, and they had to agree. One of the boys got up. The other got up. The boy picked up the tea tray on his other side and put all of his money in it. They all got in the hot tub, and once they got settled in and the boys settled in their chairs, they sat there talking, drinking their tea, and listening to each other. As they talked the other boy who had been waiting to do whatever the girl had said began to unbutton his shirt, opening the buttons. When he was done he dropped the shirt onto the chair, turned around and sat back down again. When he was finished, his shirt fell off his shoulders and his pants. The two girls continued to chat as they stared at each other. When the boy that had come to their side undid his pants and lowered them to his ankles, he sat back down in the hot tub and his pants and underwear too. Both of them stared at their men while they stood there in his clothes. There wasn't anything they could do, it would take them forever to get naked, but they would hurry.</p> <p>"We needâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
