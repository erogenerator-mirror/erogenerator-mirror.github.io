There wasn't a speck of dust floating between the two stones." He answered, rubbing his nose. "And it wasn't even wet. It just glowed and cooled me off, just like a little lamp. It doesn't bother me though. It's not as though I want it to just fade away like water. It's more like a ghostly sensation. It keeps reminding me that I'm here with you."</p> <p>The feel of the night sky on her body was still unfamiliar. It was beautiful but strange somehow. A shadow fell in the distance. It was a woman and a child.</p> <p>"You'd be right," Rachel said, and her eyes met his again.</p> <p>"I think I'd better get back to work then," he said. "I have work to do tomorrow morning."</p> <p>Rachel laughed and turned to leave. "I've got to go."</p> <p>"Yes you do," he smiled back and kissed her.</p> <p>"Oh, and you should go," he added.</p> <p>She felt her heart leap at his words. There was so much he wouldn't leave without telling her. Maybe if he talked to someone, he wouldn't let her run so fast. She'd never have to run that fast.</p> <p>***************</p> <p>The day dragged on. Rachel and John made quick work of things. They didn't really need the money. Everything they'd put in the bank had gone through and all they had to do was get it all paid for. They had no more to fear from a thief. They did what they thought they needed to do on this day.</p> <p>The work took on a life of its own and it didn't seem to bother Rachel. It was only when things got complicated for her that she was able to find her own answers to her questions. They got her out of the office late, and into the car on their way back to St. Louis. Rachel hadn't been able to concentrate on work and she didn't need the distraction. She couldn't concentrate when her mind was filled with the thoughts of John's cock inside her.</p> <p>When they got back to their room there was a small stain on the carpet in their haste for a second date. John's face was an inch from hers so hard it almost hurt. Rachel put her hands over his and looked up at him. "How could this be happening," she thought to herself.</p> <p>She could feel the blush creeping up her cheeks. John kissed her forehead, taking special care to not put his lips on her cheeks. He didn't try to kiss her on the mouth just yet. When he did he lingered for a long time. She felt a twinge between her legs and she rubbed her thighs together to try and relieve some of the pressure that had built.</p> <p>When it was over they stood and hugged in the car again. He ran his hand down her buttock and it was almost as if she was just being turned on by his touch.</p> <p>"Don't you go away," she said, pushing back her shoulder to look him in the face.</p> <p>He grinned, put on a gentle kiss on her cheek and said, "I will, if you want me too."</p> <p>Rachel smiled and stepped from the car. "Where are we going?"</p> <p>John looked over to the open window and said, "You've got all the tickets, right?"</p> <p>Rachel nodded and said, "I bought it."</p> <p>He handed her his ticket. Her hands shook slightly so she took off the hat and hung it on a post. "There. That will be over a hundred dollars. I'll see about a hundred and seventy dollars, if you want?"</p> <p>Rachel nodded and smiled. She thought to herself she could never go on a date until she got her things together and left the house and the apartment. He pulled her into his arms and she clung to him as she felt his hard cock pressing into her tummy.</p> <p>"I got home and I wanted to tell you. You got home okay."</p> <p>Rachel nodded. "You're the only guy that's wanted to tell me this. I want to tell you anything, anything at all."</p> <p>"Anything?" he asked.</p> <p>"Anything," she assured him. "Anything at all is just a bit of fun." Rachel pulled back a little and pressed herself against John. His hardness pressed against her tummy. There was a hunger inside which couldn't be denied, and it almost seemed as if John was in love with her. She had no doubt whatsoever of that.</p> <p>She pressed into him again and he groaned and said, "I love you," between kisses on the side of her neck before standing and turning her to him.</p> <p>Rachel turned, smiling when she saw John. When she looked back down at the ticket she saw the smallâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
