The guy said. He was standing next to Steve.</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"Me either." Steve explained. "I just go to work tomorrow morning."</p> <p>He leaned back in the chair and looked down on Steve from the couch. Steve glanced at him and wondered if he saw something. If he saw something his heart stopped. Steve was gorgeous, and had just gotten out of prison for his troubles, but for Steve, he just looked so innocent and happy. And all he had to do is give him a blowjob. "I just want him." Steve said, and gave another squeeze. "I just want him to get out of the house."</p> <p>"So we both just went out into the cold late night air, we can't tell if our mouths met." The guy laughed. "So we can just watch that movie."</p> <p>"You want to?" Steve shrugged.</p> <p>Steve's heart skipped a beat as he thought about the kiss. It certainly was a kiss to be in. And his tongue entered Steve's mouth and his arms came around Steve to hold him.</p> <p>"It's just not fair."</p> <p>"Don't feel too guilty." Steve said, and stepped over to the couch to help. "I love you."</p> <p>He smiled and shook Steve's hand. "See you after work tomorrow." Steve leaned towards his friends. "Hope you're happy at the end of it!"</p> <p>"Yeah. I might just keep you around, Steve. I'm just gonna go to bed."</p> <p>"Don't do that if it'll ruin these new plans for me."</p> <p>"I'll go to bed, too. Besides, I'm staying in here."</p> <p>Steve leaned against the front passenger door of the car. A small smile crossed Steve's face as he remembered when he had gone and spent the night back home.</p> <p>"Oh, hey, come in. It's a pretty nice place. You guys like it?"</p> <p>A few of the guys stepped inside, and looked around. Steve was happy to see the guys looking back at him. Their eyes were wide and he wondered if they could see Steve's big hard cock as he slid into the back seat.</p> <p>"I'm just going to bed, I'm afraid I might wake you." Steve leaned back and opened the door, as if he was going to sit down. "Or, maybe you'd rather I get into the movie right now."</p> <p>Steve turned and went into the movie theater. He sat down next to his girlfriend, and reached over and pulled her along. As he sat down beside her, he leaned over and whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"I need to get your cock out of the pants, before it gets too painful." Steve giggled as he ran his hand along her bare thigh.</p> <p>"Really." Her eyes darted up at him, as her finger ran along his leg. Steve's eyes went wide as she smiled and moved closer to him. Their hands found their way under each others clothes and Steve groaned softly as she took his hard cock in her hands.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want me to do something for you?" Steve asked as he pulled the zipper up.</p> <p>"Maybe." She nodded and reached inside his boxers and gave his hard cock a squeeze.</p> <p>"Come on." She whispered.</p> <p>Steve followed her down the aisle as they headed back to their room. The room wasn't too big and they quickly got undressed and laid on their bed. They turned on the television as they kissed each other deeply. Steve broke the kiss as the soft sounds of music played.</p> <p>"God, it's been such a long time since we've done anything like this!" Steve said as he pulled one of her nipples into his mouth.</p> <p>"So long." Her lips pulled him closer. "And my nipples are so hard."</p> <p>"It's been a long time since I've taken a good look at you." Steve smiled as his cock pushed against her pussy.</p> <p>"Mmm." Her face turned red as she felt his cock rubbing along her wet slit. As a matter of fact, she felt her own cock becoming harder.</p> <p>Steve's cock pushed her legs back and Steve began to kiss her breasts and work on her nipples. His hands moved from her nipples to her thighs as they rubbed together. As they neared their climaxes, they both were going wild.</p> <p>"Take me, Steve." Her words were soft. "Take my pussy. Make me cum all over your cock."</p> <p>Steve was on top, his cock pumping into her as they pressed together. They lay on their sides holding each other tight. Their kiss never broke. Steve could sense the urgency of their desire and their bodies began to move against each other.</p> <p>Steve felt his cock begin to shoot, felt it'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
