I have to do you both and it's going to be great."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "Go ahead, but I want you, too."</p> <p>"I can't believe he just did that," she said. "Oh, that he did. He did it to a friend, and it was great. So, I wanted to feel good because he knew I wouldn't mind."</p> <p>"You're kidding, right?" I said. "And it didn't hurt, it was kind of nice after."</p> <p>"I told you I was a virgin and I want to feel different," she said. "But I've only ever done it with you guys, but this is great!"</p> <p>"Don't tell her he cheated," I told her. "I think he really enjoyed it and if he ever does this again, I can help him out."</p> <p>"No. I will stop."</p> <p>"Ok, but do you want to do him again," I asked.</p> <p>"That's not the question," she said. "I was just thinking of the idea of what he'd do. We always do it with just me and her."</p> <p>"What's that mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"A couple," she said. "A couple of guys I know, or I guess, one couple I know. They just watch me fuck and I know what he's thinking, but we've never done anything."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know," I told her. "Do you?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure, but if we make a lot of noise, we can get kicked out of the house," she said to me. "You guys should go on a beach holiday and it might add to your sex life."</p> <p>"We really should go to that beach resort. Why do they have some special friends there?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, their names are in all the newspapers. And this is a nudist camp. Most of the women who have seen the beach, are members of the nudist camp, and some of them wear bikinis as part of the holiday. They don't know people are there, so they can feel free to just go. They can get a nice view in a nearby building and have some fun."</p> <p>"You get naked, you get gang banged," she said. "I don't think you'd get an erection if I sat on your lap."</p> <p>"Are you kidding?" I asked incredulously. "I really could get a hard on if I did that here without taking it off." "You don't have to worry about it," she told me. "I got you so turned on that you actually got off on the idea we were going to have sex. Just think about it."</p> <p>She finished eating the rest of her pizza while I went back to my office to clean up a bit. It's always kind of hot, and you've been with lots of women who've said that, but I'd already started to get hard before I even thought about fucking one. Sure, it was fun, but it's not the kind of sexual experience I was looking for. Besides, I could still see my ex-wife's pussy and I would be able to see into the house if I walked in quietly.</p> <p>When I came out of the bedroom, she was sitting on the couch and she had her arm around me. I thought it was weird and I was afraid of what she might think. "You're still dressed," she said, shaking me.</p> <p>"I just finished my shower."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said. "I got the lotion and I thought I'd do you some massage instead."</p> <p>She slipped her tank top off and tossed it on the floor and pulled her panties down to her ankles. She had no tan lines, but she wasn't really tan either. I couldn't believe her. She was a good looking girl who I would bet that she wouldn't get a hard on if she had me in a similar situation. "Lie down on the bed so I can get your oil and start on you."</p> <p>I was lying down to wait and it showed. Her legs were spread and she was putting oil on her boobs before sliding her bikini bottoms down. She looked good, but not nearly as good as I was. What she did not do was roll the top off her legs. The only thing I could think of was that she'd not had her nipples as hard as mine were in a long time. But the idea that this was just a new experience for her was exciting. She lay back on the bed, her legs open in anticipation and I got up on my knees to get a better view.</p> <p>She let out a little moan when I took my head out of my pussy and slid it up her leg. She moved the oil aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
