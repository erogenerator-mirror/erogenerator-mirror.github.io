It is almost always a matter of timing, so please don't be afraid to tell me."</p> <p>He pulled on a loose fitting sweater; it fell halfway down his back. Her soft fingers grazed the fabric as they worked it across his shoulders, down his arms, over his chest, down his belly and then it pooled around his waist, almost disappearing in his belly button. She paused to take the belt off and then lifted her lips to his hard shaft. He was already swollen, but it filled her lips without any hint of teasing. Her tongue ran across his purple tip before she took him deep inside. She slid her tongue around, as he pulled her up to him, her wet tongue flicking out to make wet circles on his chest. They continued, making her way around to his ass. She worked his hole with her fingers, sliding a finger in and out to the wetness.</p> <p>"This is what we are going to do." She smiled as she pulled her head back and opened his ass wide. As soon as the tip popped through, the pleasure built. She had never gone down on a man before, but now it was his first time.</p> <p>"Are you ready for this" she asked him as she took him deeper and deeper. Finally she had her lips around his balls and his shaft buried inside. His moan was loud.</p> <p>"This is the easiest part."</p> <p>She could have gone on. This was all she had to do, all it would take. But she didn't. Her tongue lashed around his cock head as she slid it back in, her lips stretched around his shaft. Their wet bodies moved together as they made wet slurping noises. She loved sucking cock.</p> <p>"Don't hold back," he said as she went nuts with her mouth.</p> <p>She had already worked her tongue over his cock head and down through his slit. Her teeth grazed the length of his shaft as she slid her lips past the mushroom, her head coming off of his cock.</p> <p>"Ah!" he cried out as she popped the head up into her mouth. His hand held hers at her waist, squeezing both tits, his eyes watching her mouth go down him. When his cock slipped between her lips and down her throat, he came instantly. She loved the way he could get so close when she had him ready to come at the last second. It surprised her, as she expected he would. That he would be able to hold back the coming. That seemed to last him a few seconds.</p> <p>"Ah!" he screamed and came hard into her mouth. He came fast, the first load hitting her in the back of the throat when it was released. The second spurt hit her in the face, the load splattering all over her breasts and his stomach. She loved the look on his face, watching her suck down the juices that had just flowed as his cock jerked and spurted. His last shot made a little mess on her chin and neck because of the load on her tits and between her legs. She swallowed as it oozed out.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry I got carried away. I should have known if you really want it I can finish it off."</p> <p>"We're just getting started." The two had been going at it now for a few minutes. Her hand had slid under his sweater, squeezing the other one. His hand was still in hers, rubbing her tits and nipples.</p> <p>"We are going to finish in a few minutes, if you can stand it." He tried to get her to remove his hand. She didn't want to do it. She wanted him to have a good first time.</p> <p>"You aren't going anywhere." He didn't have a car, but she had a couple of blankets and other toiletries and had him lie on them when he fell asleep. He had a good nights' rest in them. He felt like she was an expert on making a guy come. She got him on the edge of the bed and she sucked the head of his cock back to his belly. She moved up his body, leaving room between their bodies. The head of his cock ran up her stomach as she sucked the shaft down, just to the tip.</p> <p>"Just like that."</p> <p>She moved the head to her mouth, sliding a third hand between them and into her wet pussy. His finger went to the hood of her clit and rubbed in circles as she jerked her hips on him. She couldn't take it anymore.</p> <p>"Suck my cock." She couldn't believe what she was saying, although that was hard for her to believe. She knew it would make him come, but she was afraid that was not going to happen. He had never gone all the way before. His finger began to slide back and forth across her clit. Just the feeling of a finger onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
