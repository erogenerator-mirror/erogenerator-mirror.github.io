I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Why you bastard of a piece of ass!" He said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I'm not sure what makes you think that?" I smiled.</p> <p>"Honey I am not sure I want to hear from you either, but I will be back soon." He grinned at me as he walked toward the door.</p> <p>"Well then let me go wash up and enjoy myself. I'd love to talk to you when I get back." I said as I turned and walked through the door.</p> <p>As I reached the door he grabbed me by the waist and pulled me to him. I thought I'd melt into him at that moment. That was just the thing to do. We shared a hug and a kiss just as the door closed. I could feel his hard cock pressing against my thigh as one of his hands went to my ass. I gave him a knowing smile as I kissed him. Then I pushed him up against the door and slid my hands up his body. Feeling the weight of him against me made me want him even more. Then I felt his hand run down my back and wrap itself around my cock. As I stepped back he wrapped his arms around me. Slowly he started to pull me back and off the floor. Finally we moved to the very bed. We took the time to just talk about nothing but the feeling of each other being in a position to fulfill a desire we had shared, for only the second or third time.</p> <p>We lay on the bed with me on my back and he on top of me. Both of us were getting a bit worked up so we moved together to bring us both to orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh god your cock feels so good in my pussy. You just love to watch me cum don't you?" he said in a voice dripping with lust.</p> <p>"Mmhmm." I said as he continued to kiss me. It is only a matter of time before he would have me begging for more of that cock.</p> <p>As we moved together with each other again we kissed and caressed each other. We were in the throes of our passion and knew that neither would mind it. I lifted him off of me and kissed him good night as I moved toward the bed. He pulled me down on him and we kissed again. His cock remained hard against me. I reached down and pulled my shorts off. Then I guided him into me and rolled over as he entered my pussy.</p> <p>"Oh yea." I moaned as he thrust inside me.</p> <p>I started to fuck him as I told him. His hands went to my tits as we started to fuck harder then I had ever fucked before. The feeling of him filling my pussy was so much more erotic than if he had taken his clothes off. He rolled us over to one side and fucked me harder making a lot more noise then I had ever made him. It was almost a scream of pleasure and lust. His cock was hard and pulsating inside me. I felt his cum hit my insides as we orgasmed together. When he finished we were still coupled as I lay on top of him exhausted from our fucking.</p> <p>I don't care what anyone or anything says you can't be wrongâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
