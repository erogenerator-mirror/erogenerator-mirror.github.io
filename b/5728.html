It's just something I've always wanted to try... I'm a virgin down there," I stuttered out trying to pull away and pull away fast.</p> <p>"It's because you've never been with anybody down there," Lisa giggled with amusement "I'm the first girl you've ever kissed and we didn't even have a chance to get naked... I was totally freaked out when your tongue first touched me just a little bit," she said in my ear "It seemed so wrong... I wanted you... didn't we kiss a little too long?" she asked with a grin.</p> <p>"No we weren't kissing that long... You must have been busy," I said nervously taking her hand and squeezing it firmly.</p> <p>"That is because you never tried to kiss me back," she said gently.</p> <p>"But... I... can't get my mouth around your..." I stuttering out as I stammered out my objection to the idea, hoping for some more words between our kiss.</p> <p>"What's your name," I asked while staring at hers.</p> <p>"Sharon... Sharon," she said softly looking at her hands.</p> <p>"Sharon, right... so you've never been with anyone down there," I asked while wondering what Sharon was like down there.</p> <p>"No not really... it was different because I was a virgin... And... well... I think my first time was not that great." she said with a smile.</p> <p>"You're kidding, right?" I joked as in my defense of me being a virgin.</p> <p>"Nope... so that means nobody's ever had a good... I'm just not the same person... I'm embarrassed." she said while in her softest voice.</p> <p>"Oh... that's all right," I managed to say when we broke our lips.</p> <p>"What's so funny?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know! I can't believe I just said that!" I exclaimed in disbelief.</p> <p>"Well... that's not the first time you have called me that... I'll be honest... I guess you can't say anything to that effect when you're not naked now," she smiled at me.</p> <p>"Uhhh... I didn't mean to..." I stammered looking away for a while. "I-I'm sorry. It was just..."</p> <p>"That's okay," she said reassuringly taking me in her strong arms. "Now we're even. We're about too." she said in a soft yet playful tone.</p> <p>"I don't know... It didn't really seem like it to me," I said and looked at her again.</p> <p>"Well... that was unexpected... but..." I said feeling like a little kid again.</p> <p>"Are you really sure? I didn't mean to be such a bitch. You just... I guess... it didn't make any difference," she said brushing my hair away from my face.</p> <p>I was taken back just a bit... She was my girlfriend... and if this was the same feeling... I guess it was worth it. She still had a bit of a crush on me... I hadn't dated anybody in my life that I could totally see... so... I had kissed her like I had before... It seemed like I was still in awe of her...</p> <p>"This is no different in a sexual way than anything you've done," she said reassuring me.</p> <p>"I don't know..." I began but she interrupted me.</p> <p>"Do you kiss girls... a lot like you did me?"</p> <p>"I... ah... No it's not," I replied feeling a little uncomfortable in the after effects of the alcohol.</p> <p>"Is that the reason why you've never been with a first time?" she asked with a smile in her voice. "I'd sure like to hear how it is," she added.</p> <p>"Well let's just get used to it, shall we? I promise I'll never do anything bad or hurt you... I promise..." I assured her. Before going any further, she took my hand and led me to a darkened back room of the building. We quickly got naked and entered a dark area where darkness was almost nonexistent.</p> <p>"Now... take off your clothes... I just want to make love to you," she ordered with a giggle knowing full well where this could lead.</p> <p>"I'm not dressed like this... for the first time," I said hoping she'd hurry back to the shower and leave me alone.</p> <p>"Come on... be naked... I have a confession... I didn't tell you..." she said with a small smile of innocence.</p> <p>"What's wrong with being naked...
