He began to moan in response to his excitement, and then she leaned forward again, her mouth opened, and her tongue licked along his length slowly, lapping at her own juices. Her movements became more insistent and frenzied, and the pressure on his cock grew as he watched the movement. And her tongue moved faster, the lapping and the sucking became urgent, faster, more frantic.</p> <p>She began to move her ass against his body, sliding around him, pressing against him, pulling at him. She slid down his body, her weight pinning him. She continued to take him in and out of her mouth, licking and tasting him, and then taking him out, licking slowly up and down, licking and sucking at his shaft, tasting the head of him. He felt warm and soft up against him, not hard and large like he had imagined it, but warm and hard and thick.</p> <p>He felt her lips come down slightly, her tongue licking between each stroke. His legs went weak as he leaned back into her mouth as her mouth moved to him, her tongue stroked him, her lips sucked and her tongue stroked him. The feeling was very different, he found, different than the first time. It was very intense, very exciting. He saw her eyes widen as she felt him press up into her mouth.</p> <p>He could see her smile. For a moment she didn't move, and then her eyes closed, she looked as if she was lost in concentration, and then she pulled off of him, stood up and took him into her. In just a few seconds he was inside her, in her, in her body. She kissed him hard on his cheek, as he began to move, in and out of her body. His motions were long and gentle, and it was wonderful to be held, in her arms, in her body, in her pleasure. He felt her hand move down the back of his thigh, but she pressed against it as if it were a barrier, and he felt her fingers curl around his erection. The motion was steady, almost like a blur, and she increased her motion, moving her body as if they were doing every motion, feeling his motion, her own, and watching his as they reached orgasm, with each stroke he entered her, each time she reached them. She felt herself beginning to respond, almost as if it had an immediate need.</p> <p>As she came, he began to move faster and harder, and her body went into her own, a ripple of pleasure that felt as if it were a tidal wave. "Yes!" she cried out, with a scream like a cat "yes!" "Yes!" "Yes!" And she came again, and again he felt himself rising. He felt his balls tighten, and then he came as she did, feeling jets of semen as he did. And he exploded into her body as she did, his first eruption of the night seeming like the most intense in a long time. Their movements seemed to be slowed by the energy of their orgasms. They didn't move.</p> <p>She looked out the window at her face, as his cock slid out of her body. He held her in his arms, his lips found hers, and the kiss continued, tongues swirling and caressing, fingers touching, running over each others bodies. Once they had moved away and he was breathing heavily, his hand began to caress her breast again. It was very soft and he found her nipple seemed as hard as ever.</p> <p>"We are good!" she smiled, "we have gone far too far!" "We have a lot to go, and we have to move onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
