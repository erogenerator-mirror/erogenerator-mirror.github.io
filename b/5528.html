"Hey, yourself."</p> <p>"What's up?" I was glad to see she looked like she was in an even stronger mood. "So, you know," I continued, trying to lighten the tension on her face, "I have the feeling that we'll be having problems when the game is up."</p> <p>"Well, good," she said, shaking her head "and what do you mean by that, exactly?"</p> <p>"Oh, I had to tell you," I explained, then quickly added, "but what did you have in mind?"</p> <p>"Well, I didn't have anything planned, but that kind of means we'll be having some trouble."</p> <p>We just sat there looking at each other. I'm sure she was trying to keep quiet, for the first time in her life, and this feeling was beginning to overwhelm her. She didn't say a word, no matter what she was thinking, until she spoke.</p> <p>"I know you can see right at the back," she said, looking at me in disbelief. "Don't worry – it's not a big deal."</p> <p>"Well, it's not a big deal in the sense that everything will be different today!" I reassured her. "We'll just have to settle the bets."</p> <p>"I don't know about that," she said uncertainly. "I'm not ready."</p> <p>I couldn't have said more so, really. I let it go, just in case she didn't completely follow me on my feet.</p> <p>"Do you think you can take him home with you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure," the woman replied "why not?" she answered. When it seemed she'd gotten herself under control, I suggested we find a motel for the night.</p> <p>"Sounds kind of fun, I guess," she replied. "But, I don't have enough room to carry him, and-"</p> <p>"It's fine," I reassured her, "let him have another couple of moments, then we'll leave."</p> <p>"I don't think they'll mind it," she said, and I could tell the tension melted away in the room, leaving her more or less unafraid.</p> <p>"Let's try it," I suggested, "then make yourself comfortable and we'll leave."</p> <p>After the couple of minutes she seemed to have had, the woman took a moment to relax and take stock of her surroundings, then sat back, staring at the floor, seemingly trying to process what had just happened.</p> <p>I went to the bathroom and sat down on the couch, the woman still looking at the floor.</p> <p>"What happened?" she wondered. "You shouldn't have kissed that poor girl. She's not very hot, is she?"</p> <p>There was definitely something she couldn't handle, as well as the fact that her boyfriend seemed to have been a bad influence on her, and I didn't think I'd have wanted to hear it when I'd left.</p> <p>"Don't tell her," I told her. "Don't ask about it, ok?"</p> <p>The woman nodded, and then spoke the first words of the morning. "We were just talking and I told her about you. And before you ask we were just sitting and talking about the guys that are going to make us all come and spend our lives with you."</p> <p>She stopped speaking for a moment and looked at me. Not knowing what to say, she continued, "There's not even a good excuse other than my boyfriend here doesn't have a name," she mused. "And to be fair, I can see his name on his lips."</p> <p>"What are you talking about," I asked, and the woman hesitated for only a split second. "I think you have it wrong."</p> <p>"I don't think," she answered, and after a long pause, she continued, "And I'd prefer yours so I don't think we'd be going home today."</p> <p>"Well, that's fine," I said thoughtfully, and was rewarded with a look from the woman, which I thought was very funny.</p> <p>"You can call me whatever you like," she said, and after a brief pause, she said, "But, I won't have time to make an ass out of myself right now."</p> <p>"Maybe we'll see," I said. "We'll see."</p> <p>As if to emphasize my point, I picked the phone up and dialed a number. There was an immediate reaction from the woman, then she looked up, and said, "Oh, sorry, I guess I just got so wet I thought my body would betray me."</p> <p>"It's ok," I reassured her—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
