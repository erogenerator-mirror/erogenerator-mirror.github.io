I teased. Then I began to slide my hand down, and let her slip off of mine.</p> <p>She pulled up hard into me. I held onto her, kissing her hard as our bodies became one. "That's one of the best things I ever had." she cooed. "I love you, baby."</p> <p>I kissed her again. "I love you, too."</p> <p>She kissed me again, and I moved my hand to her breast, feeling her nipple begin to swell and become a hard little nub in my fingers. At the same time I felt her hand slide over me, and she began to kiss me more passionately as well. It got very hot there and it felt wonderful.</p> <p>Our kissing got harder. Slowly, she broke from our kiss, then stood up. She sat down on the bench of the table on which I had been sitting. I got back up quickly.</p> <p>"No!" she said, trying to pull me to her. It didn't work. "Just do it, damn it!"</p> <p>I looked around. There wasn't a single person here. I got on my knees behind her. "Look! You didn't... "</p> <p>She stopped me. "Just stop thinking, honey." she told me. "You have to do it. It's been a hell of a day... and a week... and I wanted to do that."</p> <p>"So how do you know about it?" I asked.</p> <p>Before she could reply, I started to run my finger along one of her soft little mounds. She tried shaking her head off, but I held on. "Don't think. Just do it..."</p> <p>My finger continued to rub between her cheeks. She shivered when it touched the little crease between her cheeks and my finger. I started to rub the crease deeper down, rubbing her little opening softly, letting my finger slide between the inner lips of her body.</p> <p>Her legs parted a little bit. She began to push her bottom back into me, trying to get me to do more.</p> <p>"You're trying too hard... It's gonna hurt," I warned.</p> <p>She shook her head. "It's okay. Just let me... let me do it... " she whispered back. "You can do what ever you want."</p> <p>I kept on, gently fingering her through her panties. I could feel that it was almost painful. But she was already moving back. I could now feel the inside of her panties. She had no pants on under them. A finger slipped down and between her wet lips.</p> <p>"Ah!" she whispered as she felt the tip of my finger begin to stroke across the opening of her sex. "Yessss."</p> <p>As I pressed into her, my finger slowly began to penetrate her. I could feel the soft skin of her inner labia on the tip of my finger.</p> <p>"It feels good... "she murmured. "It's just... like... you said it..."</p> <p>The words hung a little on her lips, but she tried to talk through a mouthful of saliva, and the rest of her saliva spilled over the edges of her blouse.</p> <p>"It's okay," I said.</p> <p>A moan escaped that little mouth of hers. Then her head suddenly fell back.</p> <p>"Oh god, baby. That's wonderful."</p> <p>I pressed my finger into her. It slid deep, I knew, past her hymen, and I heard a tiny 'pop' that she made when I touched her. It was music to my ears.</p> <p>I stopped suddenly as I felt something... at the bottom of her opening. She was definitely very tight.... Her vagina was incredibly smooth. I stopped and let her get a little bit accustomed to it. Then gently I started to fuck her with the tip of my finger.</p> <p>"Oh god..." She said. "I... I'll... I'll... let you... to do whatever you want..."</p> <p>I slowly pulled my finger out of her pussy, the outer lips clinging to it. She was breathing hard. "I wanted to do this to you, honey. It's been a year." I kissed her neck softly.</p> <p>I could tell this girl had been with a lot of other guys, and she had never really tried anything like this with me.</p> <p>I got up, and knelt in front of her.</p> <p>"We can try this," I said, looking up at her as I slid my finger back slowly up her opening once more. She looked so sexy laying there, with my finger gently, gently moving across her opening. She looked so fucking hot, and I felt myself getting aroused with each pass of my fingerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
