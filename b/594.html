"I don't know what came over me. But when you look at me..." She looked back up at the door, which she could see was partially closed, "I think I know what came over me. I'm sorry but I just couldn't go on."</p> <p>"No, no, you just lost it and..." I stopped myself and took another drink of wine. "I don't think it's that bad. I guess my mistake, you know?" I didn't know exactly what to say about it, not to myself anyway. It wasn't something I could do, but to Rachel I was certain she didn't. Not about letting her go off on her own this night.</p> <p>She shook her head. "No. I mean... it sounds a little crazy, but I just had a little too much," she said. "It just kind of happened to me."</p> <p>"No," I smiled. "No it wasn't anything to do with you, I think. It just came about because you were suddenly this big into things. I can't imagine that you weren't having fun when you were on the edge the other day."</p> <p>Rachel smiled at me. "You're a very kind man, Paul."</p> <p>"I'm not your boss," I told her with a laugh and reached under my arm. "And I'll never be, but thank you for doing this for me. Thanks, thank you."</p> <p>Rachel leaned back into the sofa and closed her eyes. She kept looking right at the door, just staying there. "It's okay," she finally whispered. "I'm never going to let you go again."</p> <p>"I know," I said, thinking back to the night I'd shared my fantasies with her. "I'm glad I got to feel that way."</p> <p>"Me, too," she said, with a laugh. "I don't like to feel that way about a man I just met." She opened her eyes in surprise. "You're a good man to live with, you know."</p> <p>"Yeah," I smiled. "Maybe not every man, but I try to."</p> <p>"No, you know I'm not that," she said, and she took another sip of wine, but it was a little longer. "It's just, you know. I'm not attracted to others, you know, other people. It's just a natural thing, a common thing to do."</p> <p>"Yeah," I smiled, and she looked up at the door again. "You're just saying that to make me feel better."</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I offended you." She closed her eyes and bit her lip. "I'll never do that again, you know." She looked up again and looked at me again. "You can't be that serious. You're a beautiful young man and I'd love to find other men like you, but that's only the beginning. I'm not that kind."</p> <p>"But you're my wife," I said. "Your boyfriend. I'm not trying to steal your heart, remember? I just don't feel that way for you."</p> <p>She opened her eyes, and she gave me an enigmatic smile. "Thank you," she said. "I'm flattered that you felt that way about me, but I don't think that's it."</p> <p>She looked at me intently and slowly leaned her head back. Her arms went around her head, and she raised them up to her neck. "I can't tell you how happy I am to have something like that in my life again. If it'd been to have a boyfriend and not have to worry about being in love with him every time, I don't think I'd have been able to do it."</p> <p>Her eyes opened again and she leaned forward again. "As for having to live with this, it doesn't really bother me," she said. "It's my own mess though, right?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Well, I'm okay with it."</p> <p>"But you said you loved someone before," she said. "Maybe you're missing something here, but I think you're missing something here."</p> <p>"Maybe," I agreed.</p> <p>"Good," she sighed and leaned back. "Because if you don't feel that way then I might not feel it. But I do." She kissed me tenderly on the lips. "If you don't care what happened in the past we can't live with it."</p> <p>"It's a good thing," I said. "It doesn't matter to me that it happened."</p> <p>"Oh, please don't try that," she said. "It's no reason to worry about that. There are things you don't have to worry about."</p> <p>"How do you know?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm sure there are someâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
