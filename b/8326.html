The whole time we talked and drank, I tried, but there were still moments where I found myself unable to talk or move. Then I became angry and felt that I would lose her. Finally I agreed to let her stay for a couple of weeks for two months, and the two weeks later she was gone almost a week. I was so angry I couldn't even think straight about it as she had me go shopping for a while and then come and watch the people come and go before taking her home.</p> <p>One day after shopping she came home, naked except for her heels, and I had a hard time not to notice that she wasn't wearing a condom and I wanted to see her face when I came inside her. She came into the kitchen and leaned over my knee.</p> <p></p> <p>"Do you know what would happen to me. I wouldn't want you to ever tell me what happens to me again."</p> <p>"Naw, I guess that just kind of makes you feel better, doesn't it?"</p> <p>Her heels were wet, and a strange feeling of dread crossed her lower body when she looked at me. "Do you really expect me to go to a stranger while I'm sleeping?" she said with a strange feeling, but I think she knew I didn't think much about it.</p> <p>"Not at all."</p> <p>"But do you want me to live here while you sleep, I mean, for now?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not willing to live where you live with your husband, even if that means me leaving you."</p> <p>"He won't even ask you, even though you know he has to do it and you don't even need any protection."</p> <p>"Oh, you poor dear. What is that? I thought I said we were good. Why don't we go sit on the sofa together?"</p> <p>I said I would not feel comfortable there, but she insisted. The only other person she ever had was me, so that really made sense. I didn't mind her being near me while she was sleeping.</p> <p>At first we sat facing each other on the sofa, our legs rubbing together and she put her heels on my lap and rubbed her toes across my crotch. Then she stood up and put her shoes on my lap so I could lift up her skirt. She pulled my hand between her legs and I stroked her pussy before spreading her lips and inserting my finger. As I started to finger her she looked at me, almost in fear.</p> <p>"Honey, did you ever tell me what it would feel like if you got pregnant? You'll love it, I'm sure you do."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I just stood there holding my hand against her until she looked at me.</p> <p>"No! I have to wait a while. I don't want to, but if I don't, you'll have your first baby right here."</p> <p>A week later she was with my wife, and I was sitting with my two children at home while her new husband walked into the house. I couldn't help but watch their big brown eyes as they stared at our house, the big one on the right looking, with big red hickey lines on his right arm and his hand.</p> <p>I was surprised, but felt that I could handle this. It felt as if I had finally found someone I could love again.</p> <p>"Can you be a mom to me, honey? Is that all you're going to get, since you are already married? How do you feel about it now?"</p> <p>I don't know whether I spoke or not, but it seemed to me that I was hearing and looking at the same person, and she was doing it for me.</p> <p>I felt as if it was a natural part of our relationship - she said it is what all men say - I wanted her to be happy for me, I didn't understand why her love for me was becoming more passionate. I don't know if it was because I was looking at another woman, but I could not stop my tongue or finger going in her pussy.</p> <p>"Honey, do you think I could have a baby? It's too late."</p> <p>She was sobbing now, and as she looked out the window and saw the new life of the old house growing between the front row of windows, it seemed she was thinking about it too. Then they were at the point of orgasm and I saw their expression change. When they said yes, she gave my hand a small kiss and we were soon at the top and she got back into my arms again.</p> <p>"Honey, it doesn't have to be a baby, it just needs to be yours," she said as she kept crying.
