Would you, please," he said. I don't believe I have told him anything of what happened in the ladies room. He took something out of his pants and sat down next to me. I don't know where it came from, I thought, but the thought was exciting nonetheless. He told me to take off my top and bra. He sat down beside me and placed a soft towel over my naked shoulders and massaged my neck and arms, occasionally kissing my shoulders.</p> <p>I turned off the water and stepped out of the shower. I dried myself off and slipped on a pair of shorts and my tee shirt, heading to my bedroom. I got in the bed and began my journey. I had been massaging my neck in the past, and it had become an obsession. I felt a little better when I felt that it was going to be his night, but I could definitely think of a lot of other activities.</p> <p>I was starting to get off myself when I felt his hand on my back. He moved the towel over my shoulders and down my back. I turned to see him watching me, stroking his hard cock. After he had a good look at my body I turned over and took his prick in my mouth. He had no trouble getting it to the back of my throat. In all my experience I had never known a man to take my head in this way, but I was amazed at the feeling of power and control over this man. I knew I would have to show him when we went to my place.</p> <p>He stood up and asked me to get him a beer. I didn't need any more prompting than that. He sat his beer down and began stroking his cock. I moved to lie on the bed and sucked him. He was a great lover. I had learned a lot in my short life in this profession. I sucked him off like I have learned to him at the spa, giving him full access to my body. I sucked him off and stroked his cock. I moved my head to my left, sucking him as I ran my fingers over his hairy chest. He had a hard time getting completely hard, but finally he was starting to get comfortable.</p> <p>I moved on the bed and began sucking him again. I had never wanted to do this before. He began sliding his cock in and out of my mouth, his hand caressing my body as he pulled my leg to and fro. I reached down and began fingering myself. I was in heaven. He moved his face close to mine and began licking my ear lob. He reached down and began to rub my pussy, while slipping two fingers into my hole. I stopped sucking him and reached around him and began stroking him while we played with each other. He was going in and out of my mouth at a rate that would be impossible to measure, but I knew it would have to be a good 8" if he was not. He rolled over on his back and lifted my body so I was facing him. He had a condom on and was stroking his hard meat.</p> <p>He entered me and began slowly, gently touching my clit with more pressure. I felt the first wave of orgasm starting and began to ride his cock harder. As I came I rolled to the side, not wanting to miss a drop of pleasure. He got up, removed his condom, and climbed on top of me. He began driving his hard cock into me. The head was all I thought for a second before he pulled out and entered me again. He drove me crazy until we both came in the middle of the night. He rolled off me, took the condom and put it on then we cuddled and kissed a little longer than normal, which I think was a little inappropriate.</p> <p>He got up to get his coffee. I went into the bathroom. After getting his coffee I went into my room and closed the door behind me. I quickly went to my bedroom and fell onto my bed. I was so happy. I had just taken a shower with my best friend and had no idea that this would be the end of any of our lives. But that was a different night.</p> <p>Later, as I was eating breakfast in bed, my cell phone went off. I answered it without hesitation, knowing I couldn't talk to him since we could never see each other again. It was at that moment that I felt he was being very protective of me and he was worried about the consequences of what he had done with me. I knew I had no chance with him because he had been at the spa too long. Our marriage was over.</p> <p>"Hello," I asked into the phone. "Who is this?"</p> <p>"Holly," he replied quietly. I was happy it was him and not hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
