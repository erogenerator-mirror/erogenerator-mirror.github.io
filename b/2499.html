About a decade and a half ago," she said, "I was on our first year swimming laps at the end of the lake. You can't be home right now, but I remember that we had drinks when we finished up and I sat up in my bed with my top off. I turned towards you, but you weren't in the room," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, it didn't look that bad, did it?" he said.</p> <p>"I sure didn't see you there when the sun was down." She said.</p> <p>"Yeah. What time was it?" Mark asked.</p> <p>"That's a lot of time," she said after a pregnant pause. "I don't know how long it was. I guess it was close to two hours and the night was cool. The moon hadn't turned out yet but it was pretty nice. I got in bed and you came back out and sat next to me watching TV. We sat there for a while and you started massaging my bottom and I had to reach over and hold your hand with one of my fingers so you could hold my hand. It felt really good and my head was spinning and I wasn't used to this. You started rubbing me just from ear to ear and I couldn't breathe. You were giving it to me so well. I think it was kind of a turn on."</p> <p>Mark smiled and asked again how long it was.</p> <p>"Three and a half hours. Yeah. Then what?" she said.</p> <p>"That night, it was over a little over an hour when you came up behind me and started touching me in all kinds of places I've never felt a man." She told him.</p> <p>"Oh. That was fun," he said.</p> <p>"No it wasn't. I remember it was pretty embarrassing. I think I was the only one who didn't say anything," she said.</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought it would be a little too private," Mark said.</p> <p>"I didn't realize that anyone else had to do this. You didn't mind that we were sitting there in the living room, you did you?"</p> <p>"No, not at all. We didn't even know we were there. I did feel guilty about having to come back out and do it, but it made it way easier. I had gotten used to it so quickly."</p> <p>Mark felt very comfortable and was glad that he didn't have to do any of the stuff that a man does to make himself feel good. He didn't want to get into any of the girl-talk he'd heard a hundred times with the girls he knew.</p> <p>"What now?" he said.</p> <p>"How was your first day at your school?" she asked.</p> <p>"It was good. I got into school pretty quickly, got a scholarship to the university and we got a few really good jobs in the meantime." He said.</p> <p>"You got a lot of help."</p> <p>He had to smile at the fact that she had helped him so much. He smiled at her. "It was a lot easier than I thought it would be; too nervous to do anything more than just sit there and watch TV."</p> <p>"No kidding." She said. "You still have a lot of homework to do. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun doing it."</p> <p>"Yeah. I certainly will." He said with a smile. "What about you?"</p> <p>"That's up to me." She said.</p> <p>"We'll see," he said, pulling her into his arms and hugging her to him.</p> <p>****</p> <p>That Monday, Mark went into town, stopped at the mall to pick up a few things and then ended up staying in the mall for a while. That night, he went to an all female clothing store and bought some sexy lingerie and a pair of panty hose. He really liked his Victoria's Secret. He was pretty nervous about buying things like that, but he could just say 'fuck it' and not have to take a pair of panties along. He got home pretty early that Friday night, and it was a little after 9:00. He didn't want to give up work, so he went to bed early. He started to sleep late after his shower, but it didn't bother him. He was feeling a little better with the idea that he was going to make a move on someone. He woke up late Sunday morning feeling a little better. He showered and got himself ready. It was a very light and warm shower. He was looking forward to making her happy and not having to do anything he wasn't comfortable with.</p> <p>He looked at his watch and saw that it was almost 4:00am. He pulled the sleeping bag over the sleeping bag. He put on a pair of briefs andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
