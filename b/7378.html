Does it help your mood?"</p> <p>"My mood? I'm getting used to it. I mean, I know you don't like it, but..."</p> <p>"Not really. A lot of it's just what happens in relationships. It helps you to see that you have some choices to make.</p> <p>"What kind of choices are I making?"</p> <p>"Depends," she said, winking her eye, "if you are going to let me know anything new and interesting, and if I'm still with you if you want to come here, or even if we decide to stay, it would mean I'd probably like the same thing? It's not like we were actually together, though I'm sure as long as there's someone here and I had that kind of relationship it would just be OK"</p> <p>Now the conversation was taking a bit of a strange form, and I wondered how much this might change my life. "So what happens if we decide to get married? Or if there's nothing else?"</p> <p>"We have to decide," she said, "whether to get married or not. We have to decide eventually. Now that we have that, at least, a lot of time together, there's no pressure, and it's not like we make decisions right now or anything like that..."</p> <p>"No, of course there's not."</p> <p>"I'm not making any judgments about what happened in those past few weeks. Well, I'm not. It was just my own decision making, and not something I'll take forever to figure out. I've had a lot of practice telling people, and even with your first name, how to make sure that's not your first name."</p> <p>"So do you think I should tell your mom, or dad, or whatever they had to say? What happens if we get a divorce?"</p> <p>"No, I don't think it's a good idea right now. It would be a disaster, that's all it would be a disaster...but I would be willing to go through with it, even though it might be an inconvenience for both of us." After a pause, "It was an accident because you have this feeling of impending doom, though. The thought of your dad or someone I'm sure they might be your dad has haunted you as much as ever. I can't quite explain it."</p> <p>"I'm going to need to think up a few ground rules right now, and then come and get a handle on it from your mum."</p> <p>"Can I tell you what to expect?"</p> <p>"No," I replied, "I have a feeling that we're going to have a lot of things that, at times, might be a little awkward but you'll see for yourselves in a little while. I wouldn't recommend that you get completely blind to things that were going on between us, but I would advise you to use whatever you have in mind when talking to your dad or someone."</p> <p>"I've got my own rules," she said. "First, it's your mom who is to be my conscience for the next few weeks. If she calls you, and you're alone while you're with her, you can tell her that you've made your choice before she calls you, and then you can tell her what decision you've made. It'd be really helpful to be at the complete mercy of your mum."</p> <p>"She knows where to find me?"</p> <p>"Yep," she smiled. "And she's got an address up in the mountains, so she'll never tell her daughter, or even know who I'm. She'll be happy to tell whoever I say from now on."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>"I'm going to have to think about how you'll react if your dad calls me and asks you to a divorce," she said, "but if it happens, and you do decide to come and talk to your mother I'm sure she'd be happy to have you, and make a decision and you won't be in a lot of pain."</p> <p>"You're right," I said. "You're right that my mom is the only reason I don't have a divorce or anything, that she is a free will kind of girl, and that I may actually have feelings for her that I've yet to develop because of her."</p> <p>"It's a moot point now, if I can't get hold of anything or you can't talk to your mum, just give me a call."</p> <p>"And what do I call you?" I asked hopefully, hoping that I'd be able to take care of myself before too long.</p> <p>"Your mom," she answered, with a grin on her face for a few moments. "It's so hot in here! Did you shave the rest of your hair for me?"</p> <p>"No," I replied, feeling a little self consciousâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
