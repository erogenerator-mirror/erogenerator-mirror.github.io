Her legs parted enough to give him access, as she wrapped her legs around his waist. He slowly slid his hand up her leg to her sex, then back down again.</p> <p>"Bill is your friend," she finally said.</p> <p>"Yes, mine. But I wanted to tell you something, and that I'm glad you had someone around."</p> <p>They were silent for a moment, not saying anything, just looking at each other. Jim kept his eyes on her and she looked at him, giving him an understanding sign. He had been right when he thought she was too small. She looked much younger with her legs spread around the trucker for several minutes, then she took a deep breath and leaned forward pressing her lips to his face. He couldn't resist and kissed her. At first the kiss was gentle and tender, with just the hint of a smirk on the lips, but quickly became lust in heat. It was a new level of passionate passion for him and he tried his best not to push it out of him. After several minutes of tender kissing they heard the trucker getting out of the cab while Jim pulled off his jeans and underwear.</p> <p>They stopped kissing and Jim pulled away. She turned to him and their lips met and then she kissed Bill again, the new kiss lasting a long time between them. He could feel the heat from her body in his pants as they continued making out. He didn't bother to take her bra off, just slid the straps down her arms. She was wearing some nice bra to go along with her panties and he cupped her breasts as he sat in the front seat. She slid her legs over his waist, giving him plenty of room in the back. She didn't say a word and his hands slipped down her torso toward her crotch. He pushed her skirt up to mid thigh, then slid his hands back up her legs to her hips and then back down, under the skirt, and finally to her waist. When he looked at her, he saw only concern, not desire. He didn't push her away, not yet. He slid his hands back to her waist, over the tops of her thighs, and back up her body once more to cup her breasts. She wrapped her arms around his neck again, as if to pull him into her, but he pulled away. She was still breathing fairly heavily.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, for what we just did. I'm not sure what I should be doing," she said with a look of desperation on her face.</p> <p>"How about it, do you like the new girl in your cabin, or did you already see her again?" Bill retorted, looking around nervously to see if anyone else was near.</p> <p>"Do you want her to stay with us, please?"</p> <p>"Not really. She was supposed to be with my best friend, but she was afraid that my friend was getting suspicious."</p> <p>"Are you sure that will be safe?"</p> <p>"I haven't been with a girl in a long time and I don't see how I can take this chance. I guess it will be better with someone with whom I can make a connection. You know how it is there," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah. I guess. Maybe we can use her as my 'safehousekeeper'. She might be willing to talk to someone from the next cabin."</p> <p>"Bill, can you take me home," she said.</p> <p>"I'd love to."</p> <p>Bill followed her as they drove to Jim's cabin. He followed her as she got in the back of the truck. They waited until the truck pulled away then Jim got out and opened the door for her, then he followed her inside.</p> <p>"Where are you waiting?" she asked.</p> <p>"I just had some food and drink, and thought I'd hang out with you for a bit."</p> <p>"I guess I'll let you change into something." She went back into Jim's cabin. When she returned she had changed some of her clothes. She had gone back to her own cabin and was lying on Jim's bed, wearing just her white robe tied around her body. She had thrown on her white t-shirt. The top of her robe had ridden up enough that she could see her bra through the thin cloth. Her breasts were hanging slightly downward, but her nipples were rock hard. There was no mistaking that her nipples were very sensitive. As the time seemed to pass, she couldn't resist turning and staring at Jim's naked body while doing so. She kept her eyes fixed on his eyes at first and then shifted her eyes back toward him as she layed across his lap.</p> <p>Jim's eyes were on her breasts now, but he wasn't paying attention to hers.
