What we want is mutual consent between us, but if we get caught, it might ruin our marriage."</p> <p>"That depends on the rules. I will be going through a lot of changes, and will need to be careful. If you can keep your promise to me about what you and your family would do when you found me, that will most likely stay with us for the rest of your days out of here, and we can talk about sex at your house. You can do things with your toys, that we will find out about your new habits for sure. And if I like what you do and want to, I can be with you."</p> <p>"I'll make sure the rules are sound," I said. "If it makes you feel weird about our relationship, and I'm in a relationship with a guy with a certain level of experience, go for it."</p> <p>"Ok," she nodded. "You've been a good friend. We'll talk things through at your place, and see for ourselves what you think. But right now, the way I feel about your decision to come back, I'm feeling uncomfortable. I still don't like it, I trust you, but maybe I just don't like things. I can't get you out of my mind."</p> <p>"I understand, and don't want to hurt you, you know," I said and felt very relieved. "If you are worried about the relationship, I'm not, not going to be that bad an asshole like some guys. I want you to see the relationship we have together. We'll just have to find what we want. You know what to do."</p> <p>"I guess I do know, I really do," she replied as she hugged me and held onto me, "I guess you don't. There is no way you're turning back that route."</p> <p>The night seemed to drag on forever, the thought of my wife and her new lover replaying in my mind, until I finally fell asleep around midnight, still entangled in a very tight embrace.</p> <p>I was awakened by the next morning as Kelly and Sue entered the pool room to find me in bed. Kelly asked if I wanted to go back to sleep, but I was so excited by our talk the next few days that I was asleep in seconds. When I woke again, it was to the sound of Kelly's voice.</p> <p>"Morning, sweetie," she said as she kissed me and got up to leave. "Wake up!" I heard her say. "We still have to do that stuff at your house," she added with a chuckle.</p> <p>"I know, it's just a little crazy," I replied as I got out of bed to go and get dressed. My mind was racing as I got dressed to leave. I never wanted to talk about the events of that night, but could it be worth it? All I knew for certain was that I was hooked on Kelly and would never be with a woman again. There was nothing I could do to change that, no matter how wrong.</p> <p>Kelly and Sue were also in the house when I got there, but I didn't expect them to be there for breakfast.</p> <p>It took them a couple of minutes to put together breakfast but we got right down to it. I had taken the day off from work at the office because I couldn't take care of my schedule for a week, which I didn't want in two weeks until my promotion got through to him. When I returned home, I found out I had gone from thinking about getting home to doing two things. My wife had called her dad last night, and had gone out for dinner, but would I go see her since I planned on having a couple of "girls over" to go shopping for a new baby dress and a party for the bride or groom?</p> <p>I had to get back, to work, and to see my wife, but that didn't seem as important as the decision I had made. As soon as my boss showed up to the office, I got the paperwork started and went home to get it done.</p> <p>"Hey, what's up with you?" my boss, Mr. Hanson, asked as I showed up home.</p> <p>"Well, I had to get back and finish up some work," I replied, "and I needed to get everything back to where I thought it was going to be that evening."</p> <p>"Don't worry about getting it done," he replied, "It's the least you can do for the man you've had in your life for too long."</p> <p>"Well, we're off," I smiled, going back to the work where I had my wife. "It was really nice to see you againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
