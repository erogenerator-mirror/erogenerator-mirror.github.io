My hands slipped from her buttocks to slide into her hot little sex, my fingers immediately sinking into her juicy channel. She held her breath as my fingers slid past her outer soft lips and slipped inside.</p> <p>We went on like that until we'd both climaxed, both moaning as we did.</p> <p>'Well, now I've turned him on a bit,' she said, still leaning against me. 'I'll go with the flow.'</p> <p>There wasn't going to be time to go back to our room again but our little game did get the better of us however because we soon decided to go again, this time with both of us naked. The three of us went down to our room, both of us stripping to nothing. No one had a stitch as each of us took on various parts of the other.</p> <p>'It must feel strange having a man there,' I said as I put a condom on.</p> <p>'Don't worry. It'll feel even better. I'm on the pill.'</p> <p>We did as we were told, me on my back whilst she lowered herself down on to me, my penis disappearing entirely into her hot little channel inside her. Her head dipped sideways so her mouth came alongside mine. We kissed, my lips moving over her body as she slid down onto me. We kissed deeply as she rocked her hips, moving me deep inside her as she raised herself up.</p> <p>We started to move, rising and falling together as she moved back to me, the feelings more intense with each passing day.</p> <p>'I'm going to cum again,' she said as, with surprising grace, she pulled herself back off me. 'Can we do it together?'</p> <p>We looked at each other, our breathing returning to normal.</p> <p>'Of course we can,' I said. 'I mean, we've hardly got any clothes on."</p> <p>'I like the idea of you and me as naked as we are.'</p> <p>'Mmmm,' was all I said.</p> <p>'The thought would make me giggle,' she added, 'but we can finish off in the shower as well. I'm not going to take my clothes off.'</p> <p>'We can't do that when my clothes are on, so,' I said, 'I'm sure you'll want to get naked soon though.'</p> <p>'We do,' she said, 'I can tell.'</p> <p>We laughed over that remark, not too long after that we were finished. I kissed her goodbye and headed for the shower, which left her to dress while I slipped on a pair of trousers, shirt and a jumper, my shirt not quite buttoned down.</p> <p>We headed down to where we'd last seen her before coming down. She was just pulling on her coat when I pulled the door closed.</p> <p>'Now I'm going to get a walk on the way home.' I said, standing there like an idiot looking at her with that stupid grin on my face.</p> <p>'Me too. I can't wait to get back to you.'</p> <p>I had to get through to her before she got into them again. I felt a little better as I was able to walk. At one point when I was walking along I almost tripped over the woman next door who'd just walked past. As I opened the door to her room she caught me just as I reached her door. She gave me a look that told me I needed to take the lady next door as my date of choice and she told me she'd be over a little later.</p> <p>'Are you sure?' I asked her.</p> <p>'I've got a friend over for a surprise at the weekend,' she said.</p> <p>'Do you have to go now?'</p> <p>'No. My friend's been waiting outside for a good hour for me.'</p> <p>She had a sort of knowing grin on her face again. 'You really have a nice body,' she said. 'Do you mind if I take one of yours?'</p> <p>'That would be nice. I wouldn't want to keep it from the young men around here,' I told her, still looking her up and down, hoping I'd get the chance to take her.</p> <p>As I stood back, she leaned forward as if to kiss me. Her hand came up to me and she pressed her belly down against my erection, causing me to groan.</p> <p>'You'll get your chance soon enough,' she said, as we walked into her room. 'I've got you covered.'</p> <p>She turned off the light as she closed the door behind her. There were just a faint glow of light from her bedside lamp, adding to her glow.
