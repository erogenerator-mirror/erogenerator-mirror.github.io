She whispered as she took it in her throat.</p> <p>'What?' she asked, surprised.</p> <p>As she looked around, surprised to be naked in front of him, she knew he could see everything she was, her lovely figure, her curves and the way her nipples stood proudly, hard and ready.</p> <p>His cock was already throbbing as he stood and walked towards her, taking her hands in his.</p> <p>He looked into her eyes as he kissed her, running his long nails down the sides of her face. She gasped into his mouth, and ran her fingers through his short hair. Her lips found his, and they kissed in the most passionate of ways.</p> <p>'I'm not sure what got into me,' she said, breaking the kiss to gasp for air.</p> <p>'Yes, my darling angel,' he smiled, and kissed her again, this time, more passionately.</p> <p>She leaned back on him, his tongue darting into her mouth, darting across her lips and across her jaw. For a moment, they locked fingers, her mouth still open, her tongue working overtime around him, as she wanted to make love to him like he had made her feel with his cock.</p> <p>But when she broke the kiss, he looked like a lost little boy who needed to be taken home.</p> <p>He walked to her, and pushed her back towards the bed.</p> <p>She pushed him back, as he pulled off her panties, as she stepped out of them, as he lay on the bed, his mouth on hers again, taking her lips, his lips, her lips, his tongue licking her lips, teasing her entrance.</p> <p>Her hands ran through his hair, while his long, thick tongue thrust deeper into her mouth, as she pulled and kissed him back.</p> <p>As he started working her pussy with his tongue, her hands dropped down, over his smooth chest, and found the hard muscles of his chest. They lay there, in bed together, on top of each other.</p> <p>She knew from years of experience, that being with her husband that feeling him and being with other men, was always the best feeling of a woman, and she relished it, every time her pussy rubbed on his mouth.</p> <p>But he was good, she knew, she knew that from years, and their passion. She loved the feeling when her orgasm, her second, built from him in the way that her husbands came, from her pussy.</p> <p>Her pussy twitched around his mouth as she pushed her hips downwards and held on to him, while her nipples were pressing into him, almost touching his chest. He felt her juices trickling down inside his mouth, and his own cock started to throb even more, as he sucked on her clit, sucking, nibbling at it as he pressed his thumb up against her clit, as with his mouth, he drove her into a place she'd never been before.</p> <p>Her orgasm erupted right there on, as she held his face fast, his thumb pressed hard against her clit, as he felt her pussy tighten around it, so he knew she was getting close.</p> <p>His tongue moved as he continued to kiss her, as he was still rubbing her clit.</p> <p>Sensing a movement next to them, she felt his hands move up her body, as he moved behind her.</p> <p>She could feel his hands, now, cupping her breasts, rolling her hard nipples, pinching the other one. Her back arched as he continued teasing her nipples, as she felt his hard cock pressing against her cunt, pressing down between her open thighs, and spreading her pussy lips open.</p> <p>She could hear her moaning now and knew they had just made her cum.</p> <p>She could feel that she was about to cum again, and started to buck her hips, as an orgasm hit her, the feeling of orgasm, of pleasure as it was so strong, and so new.</p> <p>Her hips were moving against his cock as his lips brushed her hair, teasing her ear with hot breath.</p> <p>Her pussy clamped even tighter around his cock as they both came together.</p> <p>He pushed away from her, as she tried to slide off him, but could not, and she felt his dick moving between her legs and moving up her body, until it was once again pressing against her clit, as it happened to them.</p> <p>His lips and tongue were on her back now, as he kissed away the tears as they flowed from her pretty eyes, as she lay on top of him, his cock still pressing against her, just as their orgasms had been.</p> <p>He kissed her as they came, gently kissing her as he knew she would beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
