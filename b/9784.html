"Now!"</p> <p>In the silence that followed, I couldn't make out whether he was agreeing or not. He obeyed without hesitation.</p> <p>"Now," I warned, "do you remember where I left off, baby?" I asked.</p> <p>He nodded. "Yes, I remember," he said. "Now, you may stop."</p> <p>"Okay," I smiled. "And this time," I added, "as soon as the waiter comes to our table, I want you naked while the waiter makes dessert!"</p> <p>He seemed confused. Was that a question?</p> <p>"And he gets to enjoy your body, as well as yours." I replied, and watched as he started pulling up his shirt.</p> <p>"And I get to enjoy yours, too..." I added.</p> <p>"We'll go back to where we were." I suggested.</p> <p>The waiter came back and helped me get off the table and make it back to my room. My mind was racing. Was this just a bit of fun? Did I really want him to be with other women? Or was all I wanted was his body that he could get used to?</p> <p>I quickly changed into my outfit and got out of the restaurant, taking the elevator down to the lobby. The waiter was making himself a tall, thin glass of orange juice. I walked through the restaurant, and saw him walking off down the main drag, heading right for the coffee and the waiter. We were almost back in the lobby before my mind was fully engaged in my shopping, and I heard the front entrance bell ding, announcing the arrival of our waiter. I took a deep breath, and walked out.</p> <p>Inside the cafe, I walked around the room, checking out the people. I couldn't place anyone, but the majority of them were familiar. And I couldn't take my eyes off them. Even my boss had some kind of smirk on his face. I smiled to myself, knowing they were a side thing that I'd not seen for months.</p> <p>"You look good, Amy!" my boss said, when I entered the cafe. "What did you get in your price?"</p> <p>"I got this lovely chocolate milk," I said as I set down my own spoon.</p> <p>"What?!!" she said loudly in my general direction. "You're not even there for the job, girl! You had to spend extra money to get here."</p> <p>"I knew it!" I replied sarcastically. "And it's not the money I don't have!"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure there are plenty of guys here who just want to get a shot at her!" she said.</p> <p>"How do you know?" I said, grinning over my shoulder.</p> <p>"I heard your name," she said. "I know who you are. And what you're not. And I think you should leave."</p> <p>"You're too good for her," she said, turning slightly towards me. "I don't think she would appreciate it much, if you were here, working for her."</p> <p>Her tone turned serious. I was relieved, and I hoped I didn't sound as annoyed as I sounded.</p> <p>"No fucking way!" she snarled. "I would do this for other people, not just her, and I won't share it with you! Now get out of here! I'm not giving you a break! Go buy a piece of you! Now! GO OR NOW!"</p> <p>I turned and hurried out of the cafe, trying to do as much as I could. I wanted to show him how much I loved him.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>I was nervous when I walked through the doors. I wanted to do everything with him that I could. I was still very confused about this whole thing, but I knew it was only because of his love. He deserved an absolute right to love someone else. And I wanted him back.</p> <p>I walked through the door without knocking. "Where is everyone?" I asked.</p> <p>"They are all here with their dates," someone replied with a slight laugh.</p> <p>"Well, that's nice to know, but I want to try out this opportunity of yours."</p> <p>My boss walked over to me and grabbed my arm. "Come on," he said, "let's make it a night to remember!"</p> <p>"I've got plenty of time to find a girl who doesn't know what she wants," he said as he pulled me inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
