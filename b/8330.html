I murmured and slowly turned on the shower.</p> <p>I felt the cold water run down my cheeks with the sudden pleasure of the temperature change.</p> <p>I pulled the t-shirt over my head, and then I took the clothes off, dropping everything on the floor at the door.</p> <p>I stepped into the shower, adjusting the stream of warm oil as I felt it penetrate the dark flesh between my shoulder blades.</p> <p>It was the most intense climax I ever experienced, and without meaning to I had to lean into the spray, as if to make it last as long as possible!</p> <p>I felt the muscles in my legs tightening against my body in orgasm as the jet of water washed away the last of the cum which has just been spurting out.</p> <p>I stood there, not sure what to do next, as another wave of euphoria swept over me, until I reached up and held the shower head, pulling it towards me and leaning forward.</p> <p>Once the water stopped flowing, I started to get out of the shower, feeling a small amount of satisfaction as I turned the shower off and walked out into the bedroom.</p> <p>I dried myself off and returned to the bedroom. My underwear was on the floor in front of my bed.</p> <p>I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the pictures before me; a little smile playing on my lips and wondering why I was still in one of my sexy poses.</p> <p>I decided not to think of that day yet, and walked over to my bed, lying down on my stomach in the lightest of touches.</p> <p>It felt like the time that brought me to the point where I felt at peace for the first time in several months, and when I closed my eyes and fell asleep with my first real feeling that I would be able to see my future without fear and apprehension.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p>I woke up in the morning feeling refreshed and ready for a day of travel, if for no other reason than to spend time with Kelly.</p> <p>I knew from the first sight in the hallway, that she was in the bathroom with me, and I smiled to myself as soon as I saw her in the brightly lit bathroom.</p> <p>I smiled back as I stepped back into the room, my arms wrapping around myself for my first morning experience.</p> <p>She smiled at me and reached over to stroke my face.</p> <p>'Well, I have been thinking about last night too' she said. 'I would love to have you stay with me, and I always keep thinking of your big cock, it makes me so wet'.</p> <p>I had to admit, that was a first for me as well, and I just grinned at her and nodded, a smile breaking onto my face.</p> <p>'I know,' I said, 'you'll want to take me out to dinner one of these days, maybe we could meet up in the park?'</p> <p>She giggled as she ran her hand over my arm and smiled back.</p> <p>'Well, let's hope it's a nice restaurant we can go!'</p> <p>****************</p> <p>We were going through town, taking along the directions I had given her. We were soon about to head out when Kelly turned round suddenly, and smiled at me.</p> <p>'We have arrived!' she stated.</p> <p>'Ahh, yes we have.' I replied, knowing instantly if I wanted a nice hot shower and a long hot morning fuck, that I would have to wait all day to be with her.</p> <p>*****************</p> <p>We checked out of the hotel first, and then proceeded to our stop at a food cafe where a young couple sat in a booth. It was quite late, and I was looking forward to having a shower.</p> <p>I was thinking, if there is only one thing I love that is a hot shower, at least I thought to myself.</p> <p>Although I was slightly disappointed at what we had just done, I was so glad that I was still here!</p> <p>We spent the next ten minutes, as I looked over the menu, and Kelly made sure I enjoyed the meals we had.</p> <p>I had a feeling that I would get some great ideas and fantasies when we got to the restaurant.</p> <p>'You are going to need to get out more often, your old clothes will just look strange and wrinkly when you get out of them, I might need to add a collar to that.' she explained. 'After all, this is a wedding!' she added, with a wicked grin.</p> <p>'I'm just going to go and shower.' I replied, turning roundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
