You don't have to answer."</p> <p>"I haven't felt that good in years."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>The phone clicked and rang again. Shelly's eyes shot open as she looked at the number. She quickly put it to the side. She wasn't going to hang up. She got off the bed and slipped into her robe. She saw her phone on the end table that showed up a text from a number,</p> <p>"What are you still doing?" Shelly didn't really bother with it but didn't really feel comfortable answering on the matter. She hung the phone up and went back over to her bed.</p> <p>"Well its only three times and I'm on vacation and I've got to get going," Shelly said.</p> <p>"Well go make your plans. We can talk over dinner a bit when your done. Bye."</p> <p>"But it's only three."</p> <p>"Please, make it longer."</p> <p>"Whatever you want."</p> <p>Shelly got back down on her hands and knees and pulled the cover up around her. She opened her robe, pulled it out and tossed it on her bed. She quickly removed her bra, pulled her panties down and lay on her bed. She was on her back, naked, lying there. There was no need to lie down because she was wet and ready for action.</p> <p>Shelly rolled on top of the covers, reached out and pulled it off her. She tossed it on her bed too. She moved into the middle of her blanket. There were just enough of her room to take care of everything. She turned and pulled a blanket over her. She threw the blanket over herself, covering her body up even better than in the night before. She felt so comfortable that she forgot to throw the blanket away. She laid down, put her hand to her face and inhaled the scent of her lover's skin. She looked at her face to see if there was a clock in the room, but saw it was only 1 AM.</p> <p>This was so different though she felt the difference. There was a difference between sex, a woman's body and a man's cock. There was a difference in her lover's cock and how it would feel between her legs. There was no one in the world to compare it but to her it wouldn't be so different than sex.</p> <p>She lay there a while longer, trying to decide what would look best to her. There was an idea that she was dying to make. She got out of bed and got out of her own robe. She didn't bother to turn on her light. She wanted to be as clear as she could be so she could enjoy the sensation of her new world.</p> <p>She lay there in her lingerie, thinking of what lay ahead with her lover. She got up from the bed and put on her favorite silk robe. She looked at herself in that mirror. She had the look that a person would see once they got that familiar look. The look that was alluring, sexy, sexy. It was alluring. She couldn't explain it but she thought she liked it. She'd come to love it. There wasn't anything like it. All she felt was beautiful.</p> <p>She put on her long black robe and went to work setting up the table in the kitchen for a light meal. She would bring it out to her lover when she walked out of the house the night before. She was thinking of her lover as her lover. It wasn't anything like that. The act as a woman didn't make her feel like that.</p> <p>She wasn't sure at all if she liked it or not. It was something she'd done before. She hadn't thought to put on her bra during the day. She was sure they were going to get together. She didn't think there was anything that she had to put on that day.</p> <p>Hee hee. All the things she'd planned out for that day were in that cupboard next to her bed. She had to wonder if she was thinking the same thing.</p> <p>It might be good too, she thought, for just to walk out to let her lover take it from her. It's not like her husband was going to do it for her.</p> <p>She was going to be his to do whatever he liked to do to her this weekend. Even if it wasn't a real date. He was going to treat her to a good time. He had told her that he wanted her to let down her hair. She would then call that man of his.</p> <p>She walked out the door, got as far as the stairs before her bedroom door opened again. There were so many things she wished she could do that she didn't even think of a reason she could think of. She sat thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
