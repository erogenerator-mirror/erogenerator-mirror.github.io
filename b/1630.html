She headed towards the bedroom. Then stopped. She was still angry and angry her body was tingling. She was shaking and scared. She wanted to leave, she knew he would protect her. However, deep down inside she knew she wanted the protection he gave her, she knew she would not turn him down. Maybe for her first time, as his wife he would be able to keep from letting her be humiliated by herself. But what if what he did was wrong, something she found abhorrent. She stood there shaking, wondering if she had ever loved a man as much as she did that night.</p> <p>She heard footsteps on the stairs, she moved towards the spare bedroom. The door opened and there he stood. His gaze went down her body and she saw her pink pussylips and swollen clitty. She stood there, her mouth agape. He reached out and caressed her cheek, "You are absolutely gorgeous." Her mouth opened and his tongue touched her lips. When the tongue came out she pushed it hard into his mouth. He had his arms about her waist and moved with her until she was under his desk and on her back. He had her legs over his shoulders, her thighs hanging over his shoulders and his head between her thighs.</p> <p>She tried to twist her knees up against him. He had to steady herself by grabbing the desk, and the desk by the chair, and using the pressure to push up against the chair, forcing her legs wider apart and lifting them up over his shoulders. Her hands flew to his face, she pressed her fingers into his hair, pushed him away and then lifted her legs and raised her hips up off the floor.</p> <p>She felt his tongue running along the softness of her inner lips. His tongue pushed her juices over her clit and she gasped when she noticed her body shudder. He moved his tongue side to side over her pussy, up and down. Her hands pulled him tighter against her and she pressed against his face with the muscles of her legs, pushing him away. Her hands pulled at his hair and she pulled at him by grinding her hips against his. The combination of pressure and pressure, she pushed towards him. He slipped lower towards her stomach, his tongue reached her lips. He held himself still and she felt his hands on her butt cheeks. She pushed against him and then pulled him closer.</p> <p>As he was pulling away from her she heard him say, "Oh God, that is so sweet." And his tongue moved inside her wet hole and made a circle. She moaned and pushed her pelvis hard against his face. He pushed his tongue in as far as it would go and she came instantly. She felt him pull back, the tip of his penis and was surprised when it came so quickly. He smiled; "Did you like that darling."</p> <p>"Yes, very much so" she murmured.</p> <p>He held himself inside her and said, "Oh God, I don't know if I can go again." Her body twitched as his hands moved around her, and his hands pushed against her lips; "Oh yes."</p> <p>He kissed her and she responded as his hand moved between her legs, his finger rubbed along her slit and then slipped into her. "Oh yes." She moaned as he moved his finger in and out of her cunt.</p> <p>"Oh yes," he repeated, his hand pressed her butt cheeks together and then the other, now also inside her. She loved being filled with his hand as he masturbated her and she found herself enjoying his caressing. Suddenly he moved one of his knees higher between her legs but instead of putting it inside her he pulled away from her and pushed her legs further apart. He put his finger to her mouth and pushed it in. "Suck it." And she did what he wanted her to. She lapped at his finger as it moved in and out of her cunt. He rubbed himself against her face and she pushed her mouth at him again. Their mouths met again and he pushed his tongue into her mouth and played at hers until she was gagging on his tongue. His cock pushed into her stomach; she felt it go in, her breasts pushed up at her chest and her nipples were stiff.</p> <p>His cock began to move in her body as he rubbed at her mound, "Oh yes my beautiful wife. Oh it feels so lovely, so lovely."</p> <p>As their mouths parted she felt her husband's hand come around her, rubbing at her clit. "Do you like that? Do you like the way I am touching you?" She moaned back at him.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"You like having your nipples stroked, rubbing gently at your bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
