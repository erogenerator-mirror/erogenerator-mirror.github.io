"I want to give you what you're always feeling." And after I told her that I had heard my brother-in-law talking to the two guys she had been fucking for a week, she climbed on top of me, leaned herself down over my cock, and took it into her pussy. And she rode me, slowly at first. And then faster until I was on my back with her on top, and I just kept trying to pull her down onto my cock, but she was holding me back and doing it for me.</p> <p>My mind went blank, and she was going faster and harder. My arms went around her back, holding her, and my hands on her breasts. And finally, I was coming to. She was sitting up, and my balls were swollen and she was riding away. We both said that we came too. And there was a big smile on her face.</p> <p>She stayed in her chair and sat there and caught her breath for a minute, and then got up. She put on some sweat pants and a shirt, and then she got out of the shower and went back to the door with a towel around her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that, and I'm sorry if I caused this. And I also, I have no regrets," she said. Then she put on her coat and left the front door. I thought I was in trouble, but I just told myself that I needed to get the video camera trained on her.</p> <p>At work that day, I couldn't focus on anything. What was I thinking? She was beautiful. And she had a nice body. But what I should have done, was start over. I would have to come up with another solution.</p> <p>Later, at lunch that Monday, she came into my cubicle. I tried to hide my face to avoid her, but she was looking at me hard. And she seemed so serious.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry, Mr. Lewis," she said. I thought I knew what her problem was, but I did not tell her that we knew each other, and we also had done a lot of the walking talk. And I said that I thought she liked it when I called her a 'loser'.</p> <p>"I do not feel like that, Lisa," I said. "And I don't want you to feel that way."</p> <p>I knew I knew what she was feeling, but I did not want to embarrass her. And I wondered if she felt that way about me, too.</p> <p>"Look, Ms. Thompson, I will do anything to make up for what we just did," I said.</p> <p>"Anything? You are my boss and I love it!" She said.</p> <p>And I felt that she was right. She and I had already made plans for Friday and I wanted her to be mine. She would have a special date that weekend and I wanted her to come all over me. And that included sex.</p> <p>I didn't know what I would do, but I did what I had to do. And I told her that even if she did decide to come and see him on Friday, I would let her watch my little business deal on Saturday. She smiled and nodded, then she got up and went to the front door. I looked up at her, and she was looking back at me.</p> <p>"Thanks, I think," I said.</p> <p>So she was really getting excited about Friday. She was probably excited to see him. But maybe I should have told her that I could give her a special gift. And that I would be her lover all weekend in exchange for it.</p> <p>Of course I thought that sounded great. But then I thought of a way to let her know that Friday would be special. And at the risk of appearing the naïve young male executive, my idea was that she would have something special inside her that day.</p> <p>She finally came into my office. She was dressed for a special night at her "office" where she was always the last to arrive. She looked stunning.</p> <p>"Mr. Lewis?" she asked with a smirk when she saw me.</p> <p>"Yes?" I said.</p> <p>"I was wondering if you could come over to my house on Saturday."</p> <p>"I would love to," I said. I realized how hard this must have looked for her. I knew she always made that kind of deal with her boss at work. But I was not willing to do anything that would risk her coming all over me.</p> <p>"Great, Ms. Thompson," she said, and she kissed me on that special cheek.</p> <p>That wasn't nearly as dramatic as it sounded. But not a bad sign.
