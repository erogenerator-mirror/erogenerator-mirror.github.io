It's not what I had expected to hear. It was also not what I expected to see inside his head. It really wasn't what I had expected. I mean, he wanted to. He was definitely trying to get me to think a little more clearly about things, and more clearly I wasn't so sure about what he wanted at all. It wasn't exactly working out, and I hadn't ever been the least bit receptive to a guy's thoughts, if I say so myself.</p> <p>He leaned against the door frame of our dorm room. A hand was on his chin, tilting him head so that he was looking me in the eye. "Listen," he continued, "It's the only place we have the chance to talk, and I don't want it to be any more than that." I nodded, and stared back at him as his eyes dropped to the floor. "You know," I started.</p> <p>He nodded, and for just a second I felt like he was finally going to leave, because the rest of the evening was already past. But I didn't want that, and I didn't want my friendship broken up. He didn't go into a relationship with someone as easily as he was with me, probably because of what I had told him, I guessed.</p> <p>But I wasn't about to do that again. "Okay." I tried to smile the whole way home. I was glad I had already been through with that conversation, I figured, and that's what all of this just came down to. He was still not going to be happy that I was back, that he didn't give me what we needed. He sounded like he was just waiting to talk to me, and maybe he just wanted to try and have fun. But what can you do to make one guy listen to you, he asks you?</p> <p>Maybe some guys can do that, but you can't be as clueless as someone who can just let go of them, when you have something that you just wanted to give a little something back that doesn't really suit the guy, the way you see that you can give back in so many ways. There's always the possibility, there's always the chance for a little more than a quick little fling, but in my opinion, there had to be a good reason as to why a guy would want to get back together with a real, genuine person, not a shallow little piece of flesh who could be bought with his cheap tricks. So I turned off my computer, and followed him down the stairs, leaving my room in the hall.</p> <p>The place was pretty busy, with some of his friends and his girlfriend waiting for him to walk down the stairs, and to his car at the end near our dorm. He was so close to me that I could smell him, and I felt nervous, but the same sense of foreboding that he had been having earlier didn't seem very far away. I had to give him credit, the thing was even going a little bit further than it had all been before, now there was a chance that I could really do this. He just had to be patient.</p> <p>I was standing in the living room, watching TV when he came through the door into the room and stopped to shake my hand, and I swear I nearly burst into tears. It had been a pretty bad night. A very bad night, but I hadn't really thought of it as anything special at all. All I felt was a certain level of awkwardness in the moment, and I felt awkward just standing there. He still had his arms crossed over his chest, which was quite a bit, and there was quite a bit of weight on it. I felt like something was missing.</p> <p>Of course I'm not talking about the way he looked at me. He's just really big, and his mouth was hanging open. He was definitely bigger than any guy I had ever been with in my life, and not just close as I was. He looked much too young to be all that long, and he also had those braces on his face, as well. When he shook my hand, he kept his lower body pressed up against me, and I could feel his arm move a little further up in my back. I felt it, a very nice feeling, considering, so I had to admit it was definitely one of the nicest feeling when I got my hand on a guy like that. After a couple minutes of him not shaking my hand, he leaned in to kiss me, and I could feel my heart beat through his lips as they went against mine. I could feel his tongue licking my lips, and I couldn't get enough of thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
