I've been looking forward to spending more of my time with you in real life. This is like the first time I have been going to these lengths to see you every day!"</p> <p>"You know, your not the only one that's wondering about having your cock filled, just you to see me every day," she said.</p> <p>"Mmm..." I was taken aback by what she was implying. Here she was asking me to make love for a date. "I didn't think you had much of sex life. Does that make me less of a man then you?"</p> <p>"Well, you didn't look like you had any sex life or a great one either. You weren't that type of guy at all," she said.</p> <p>"I think it only made sense why I don't want to spend time with a real woman," I said feeling embarrassed. "I have enough time to get to know everyone of them."</p> <p>Sue went on to explain that she had never had a cock, but that she liked it just a little bit more when getting close to someone with a nice dick. She said that she couldn't have her husband's cock inside her cunt because it had to be just enough of his sperm. She then asked me if I wanted to feel her pussy as it had only been a month since her last boyfriend had been inside her, "Would you like me to have a pussy just as tight as your pussy? I have a couple here at home that could hold a big load. Would you like to fuck me, lover boy?</p> <p>That is the most sexy thing anyone has said to me that came from me. "I really like the sound of that," I told her, "but let us go before I have to stop and pay for two nice ones."</p> <p>"I've been thinking about something that has been on my mind for awhile now..." She said, "and not just about you. I don't have a lot of experience with making love, but you do have a nice size cock."</p> <p>I kissed her softly on the lips and we made out for a few seconds before we decided to turn in for the night. We agreed to meet up Friday night when we had some more beer.</p> <p>Our first date was Friday at the apartment that her ex-husband had just left the previous night. "You remember what I told you when I came? I was saying you could stay the night if you want."</p> <p>"We could just watch a movie," I told her. "I thought you might want to know."</p> <p>We spent more than an hour kissing between then, "I love being with you."</p> <p>I said "I'm glad we are going to have the time of our lives." We then went inside to check out. Sue had already put away our change of clothes and had brought a couple of towels to spread on the sofa. On the sofa sat Sue, naked except for her thong. "That's pretty sexy," I said as I ran my hand up and down her soft thighs, "I love the feel of your skin, and the smell of your sweet juices."</p> <p>Sue looked at me with a smile. "You're so sweet, Tommy," I told her. "I've been thinking about a little something that is always a fantasy of yours to watch me get fucked."</p> <p>"But, I don't let you have my cock," she said. "I would never share you with another man, or a mother. I would never make love to you."</p> <p>"Don't worry, I would never have your cock inside me. I could never cheat on my husband for you. Ever. How about you?"</p> <p>Sue put her hand on my shoulder and looked over at me, "You know Tom, I think I might actually like that idea. I like how it makes you feel." She kissed me very softly and then pulled away. "We should not do that, it would be too nasty. I'm not sure I can handle the idea of you having your own cock inside me for the first time. I want to make you feel good."</p> <p>"You're right," I said as I took her in my arms and kissed her neck while I stroked her body. "And don't you think it would be fun to share me with another woman?"</p> <p>Sue looked into my eyes and said, "If you want to fuck a woman, then I really do want to share you." She grabbed my hand and slipped it into her thong to hold me. Our lips locked together once our clothes were off.</p> <p>"Sue....", I said, as my hand slowly slid onto her flat stomach.</p> <p>"I know what you want," she purred, "but I want you to fuck me first this time."</p> <p>I slid my body down her, and I feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
