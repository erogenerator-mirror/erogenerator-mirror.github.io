I'm not used to talking to women. At any rate, she started by taking me out for dinner. I could barely move though, all I could smell was her. I knew we'd have to be somewhere a little more private than this. When she was done, I took her hand and led her upstairs.</p> <p>We walked through the kitchen, and I started to remove my shirt. She shook her head and then said, "No, no, please. This way."</p> <p>I put one arm around her shoulders, and turned her to face me and kissed her again. I pulled our clothes down and knelt down between her legs, and she wrapped one of her legs around me, her arm was still around me. We kissed again, and I worked my way back up to her ears.</p> <p>I leaned forward and slipped my tongue between those gorgeous, pink lips. She closed her eyes and grabbed my head, pulling at my hair as she pushed her hips up. Her hand reached down for my cock.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. Take me," she said. "I want you inside me."</p> <p>I didn't think about whether or not anyone else had ever taken her before. I slid myself lower and she spread herself even wider, offering herself to me. I reached up and held those hips, and kissed her again as I slid into her. I moved up and down, letting her feel me fill the whole of her. I looked down at her body, at her eyes.</p> <p>She'd reached her hands around me and she held me there, holding me close. My arms reached down again, but she stopped me, and stepped back. She pulled me up so I was kneeling there next to her on my back, and she was holding me in her arms, my arms around her waist.</p> <p>"You're so sweet," she said.</p> <p>She let her hold go and moved to the other side of the bed. She sat next to me and lifted herself up onto the bed. I lifted myself up and moved over. I could feel the heat between her legs, and I reached down and ran my fingers over.</p> <p>"Mmmm. That feels good," she said in a whisper.</p> <p>"Want me to make you happy?" I whispered back.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good," I said. My fingers moved around and started to probe the skin on her inner thigh. When I was close to her cunt, I moved my hand back to her inner thigh and then up to her mound.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she said. "I like that too. It's really sweet." I didn't wait for her answer.</p> <p>I found her clit and started to gently stroke her. I could feel her tensing up as a shiver ran through her whole body. If everything else were right, I'd have felt her pussy contracting as the tremors ran through her.</p> <p>"Come on, lover," I whispered, and she pulled me all the way inside of her.</p> <p>Even on her back, her body was shaking. I started to feel myself start to swell. I wasn't sure whether that was because of the moment, or by not holding back from going all the way, but I sure as hell wasn't going to stop. But I had to keep my pace going.</p> <p>I started to feel her whole body move on me, her body move in time with her. I leaned over her and she went into my arms, pulling me down towards her.</p> <p>"Oh, God. Please, now. Please," she whispered.</p> <p>I didn't have to say anything more. This was just exactly what I wanted to do. I could feel the muscles in her cunt flexing and pulsing around me. She reached down to pull me even deeper inside of her.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind, but I've got this to do for a while," I said.</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm," she replied. "I like that."</p> <p>"Hmmmm, you do," I said. "Like what you're doing."</p> <p>She started to thrust her pelvis up at me. I was getting lost in her. I couldn't think about anything else. In a way, I think I understood why she was so happy, because it wasn't just the fact she was having amazing sex and the fact she'd waited so long to feel herself so full again. I couldn't seem to say any more. All of the things we'd been talking about were simply incredible, and I didn't want to let go.</p> <p>"I'm going to come," she finally told me.</p> <p>I slowed the tempo of my thrusting. I couldn't hold back. The heat of her body was driving me to the brink. I reached my hand down and stroked my own cock, a combination of our juices and hersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
