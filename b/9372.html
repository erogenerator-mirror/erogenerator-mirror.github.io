Then, I bring my fingers to my lips, and lick them slowly.</p> <p>"Oh, God," I moan softly, leaning my head back and closing my eyes.</p> <p>I start to lightly move my hands down my sides again.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes, like that."</p> <p>I pull my fingers down to kiss my nipples. Then I slide down to gently lick my fingers. My hands are still teasing my wet little pussy, now slick with my own juices.</p> <p>I bring my tongue forward to lick my lips and feel the wetness and heat of my lips. I gently slide all the way back, tasting myself for the first time. I lick and suck gently. I run my fingers up and down my lips again. They feel slick as they touch me. I use the tip of my tongue to lick them all around my lips again. I move to move the tip of my tongue to my clit, circling it. Then I stop.</p> <p>I look at myself in the mirror. I can't really see myself, can only feel my reflection. My hands slip back to my nipples again. I am almost out of my mind with pleasure.</p> <p>"Let's do this again...", I moan softly when I get back to my feet.</p> <p>I stand, turning to face him. He is watching me, and he moves, putting himself on the chair behind you. I can't help myself watching how that tight leather skirt moves, the tops of his thighs, his hips and ass, every movement. I'm getting really turned on watching how I play with myself.</p> <p>"Strip," he says, and I can see he's still hard.</p> <p>I stand there, a bit nervous. I just want to do it, I think.</p> <p>He takes my hands and pulls me forward, slowly, letting me stand naked next to him. He brings his lips up to my breasts. He softly plays with each one, pulling a nipple, and letting it snap between his lips and teeth. I arch against him, then slowly turn to face him. We gaze into each others eyes. I can see that this is how he wants me to be for this. It's how he wants me to be his. The most erotic thing in the world to him.</p> <p>"I don't know if I can..." I start to say, but he turns his look to my lips. He kisses me, then down my body. When he's finished with me on my flat stomach, just above my waist, he slides his hands down my body, sliding them down to my waist and slowly back over my hips again.</p> <p>My hips arch further; I can feel his fingertips pressing into me, tracing them over my hips before moving to my thighs. I hear myself moan slightly as he takes my skin between his fingers.</p> <p>"Mmm," he breathes, nibbling a bit.</p> <p>He slides his hands back up and rubs the oil down my legs. I am already wet and warm. He runs his fingers up across my pussy lips, tracing them, feeling them, feeling the softness of my skin. He works the oil into my cleft, up and down, moving the fingers of his other hand back to my clit.</p> <p>Oh my God, he starts to feel me. He starts to rub himself, pressing his body closer, his hips pushing into my. I lift my pussy upwards, my hand moving to the front of his pants. He slides his fingers inside me, moving quickly so his cock slides deeper.</p> <p>I reach around to touch my own breasts as I continue to work my fingers between my legs. I run circles around my nipples as I slide my hand down his abs, down his cock, back up over himself. I circle my fingers around his balls. I start to feel his shaft pulse with every stroke, getting harder.</p> <p>I run my tongue along his shaft, up the underside of the head, circling the tip just as I feel him starting to move towards me at about the same time. I spread my legs open to meet the bed, feeling his knees under me as he pushes forward.</p> <p>I feel his cum splashing against the entrance to my pussy a moment before he pushes himself forward. I arch forward and my cunt wraps around his cock, taking him inside me, filling me completely. I hold there, enjoying him as he holds himself there, deep inside me.</p> <p>He moves slightly and starts to move in and out of me slowly, a slow movement that starts just as he starts to thrust inside me. It takes nearly minutes before he begins to really fuck me. The feeling of him moving in me is so full, I just want to slide my hands to the wallâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
