"It's just something I've found and I think that I'm interested in. I've found myself wanting to talk to you about something."</p> <p>"Of course I'd like to talk to you about anything," he said. "I'm sure you have some ideas about how I might help you with your thesis?"</p> <p>"That's a good point," she said and started to walk over to the desk. "Come and sit down so I can continue. It looks like your thesis is about to come out."</p> <p>James was a bit surprised but went along anyway, sitting down in front of the computer.</p> <p>After about twenty minutes he heard her walk across the room and sit down.</p> <p>"This is really a breakthrough," James said excitedly. "I've always believed that the human brain can only be thought about by one person. I've seen some very pretty porn on the Internet. It looks like my Professor is taking a shine to me. So, if you're interested, come and see me tomorrow night, okay?"</p> <p>She looked at him for a moment. He had this strange look on his face that she couldn't quite put her finger on, so she took it between her fingers and felt for herself.</p> <p>"Uh, sure," she said.</p> <p>"Right," he said. "Good night."</p> <p>With that he closed his computer and went to bed. As he lay there, a small smile crossed his face. It certainly looked like he had thought of something. He was relieved that there was something to be said about this. At least, it wouldn't be difficult to work through the rest of the weekend when it came.</p> <p>The next day began like any other day. James had an easy time concentrating on his thesis. He spent a lot of time in his office, but he was able to do it well enough. He had many questions for Amanda about her project that he didn't have a clear understanding of but was sure that Amanda wanted to get to know him well. She seemed to be the type that just came to him, even in the absence of an actual interview in any field. He couldn't wait to get started with her.</p> <p>The following day was his normal business day. The day of his exam that went well but needed a little work. It's an interesting experience.</p> <p>Amanda came to him the next day while he was sitting in his usual spot. She walked over to him and looked at the paper as she read it.</p> <p>'I need to ask you some questions: When were you beginning to consider why you came to me?"</p> <p>Amanda looked back at him. He could tell she was about to speak the question as she looked over at him with a big smile. She quickly looked away but she held up her hand to stop what she was doing.</p> <p>"Ah," she said. "I'm still trying to process this. Can you read something back at me?"</p> <p>James looked over at the paper with surprise on his face. He had no idea what to say. Amanda was clearly asking a number of questions, but it appeared that even the questions themselves would be a bit of a surprise to him.</p> <p>"Oh. Okay," he said. "Sorry about that. I can only read a few words of the paper but I can't help it if I read a bit too much."</p> <p>Amanda laughed at him. "It's actually very funny," she said. "I'm sorry, what did you just say?"</p> <p>"I've been wondering what this one was going to be like," he said, trying to be witty.</p> <p>"Let me guess now, that you were studying ancient languages?" asked Amanda.</p> <p>"Yes, that's right," he said. "I was in a study group with my friends. The professor asked me if I was interested in ancient languages and I said yes, I'd read everything that was going on in books."</p> <p>"Well then, I'll let you answer the question then. There are three questions in the form of:</p> <p>Are you interested?</p> <p>Amanda's question was obviously something that was obviously important. He wondered if James himself had ever done any kind of history exam to obtain a better understanding of the nature of people. The professor had asked him many of the questions that the other professors had been looking forward to. One of the professors in the class asked him to take a large sheet of paper and ask Amanda to read it. He asked her to read what was written on it and gave him some suggestions to learn from.</p> <p>Amanda had a funny look on her face. She seemed to really think that this question was a sort of a surpriseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
