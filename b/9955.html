He took a gulp from a wine glass. "I mean, he does look quite a bit like his mother, but I don't know what I would've done if I met her again." When he looked up at me and blinked, I realized that he was trying to be sincere about something. "I just never knew that."</p> <p>"Well, she said as much to me." I chuckled quietly. "But anyway, she had some kind of medical crisis. And the poor thing didn't want to have anything to do with us."</p> <p>"I know, but if it was okay with you I would have felt good for her." His lips quirked into an indulgent smile. It was a sort of teasing sort of smile that he couldn't help but show. I saw the wheels on his mind and wondered about where they might be heading and then suddenly I felt the heat in my ears intensify.</p> <p>"Oh, and tell you what. I'm not going to stop by your place either tonight, if that's what you might want." I nodded to the wine, and he reached for my hand, bringing it close to his hip. At the feel of his hand that he was so comfortable touching me, I felt my own heart beat speed up. "I think we might have time for a little makeover." I could already feel that we were both breathing harder, our lips touching nervously. He nodded slowly, then glanced down at my lap. "Is that a thing you'd like to call a makeover?" His hands found their way to my waist, brushing over my flesh. "I don't really do much for a makeover. So, it would cost me quite a bit to afford it. And I don't think you'd be much of a financial success if you were not able to afford it."</p> <p>He was making me do things, but I knew that I couldn't just sit there forever. I couldn't just stand there, looking at him helplessly. He had to see me again. But this time, I wanted to be sure that he was watching, or if his eyes could tell I wanted it, or both. "I think I will just go back to your place," I finally said, grabbing his hand and leading him back towards our little town. "It's actually not much," I said after our little makeover in the bar. "That hotel downtown that used to be pretty nice, but it's been pretty bad in the last couple of years." My words tumbled off and I could feel my cheeks flush as I looked at me. He nodded in agreement. "Maybe we'll end up staying there a bit."</p> <p>"It would be a bit more difficult, I'm certain," he smiled, making me laugh and take in more of the sights as we came up. The bar was pretty large, and the food was good. There must have been fifty seats. I smiled up at him.</p> <p>"That would actually be pretty nice." He smiled at me back and I wondered if I had finally made him as aroused as I had felt him on the dance floor of our little town. There was no rush. He was here, all right. But I wasn't about to leave him in the middle of some sort of dance. I knew that he couldn't really see me, and if he did though, well, I felt sure that he looked down the hall at me.</p> <p>I took his hand again and led him out the door. I could feel the heat coming off of him. It felt nice. Not particularly huge but nice. It was definitely bigger than I'd thought it would be. Our little town seemed to be a lot less crowded. There was only one person in front of us, the barkeep. I smiled and pulled him against me slightly and felt his hard body with my own... and the one right there in front of me.</p> <p>"And," I whispered to him, "that girl over there seemed to be very interested in you. Can you just dance with me some more on the way to my place?"</p> <p>He smiled at me. "Sure." I took his hand and led him down the hall. Once we got to his room, I got hold of his hand and pulled him against me. I felt the tightness in his flesh and I knew that he was very uncomfortable. My pulse had been racing after hearing that his father had been killed the past couple of years. My heart pounding in my chest, I closed my eyes and felt the weight of his body against mine. As I remembered that night in my mind, it was the only time that he had moved away from my body. Even if I had given him only the slightest bit of resistance, I have to admit that my body needed to respond, for I hadn't been able to stop myself from letting the thoughts of what myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
