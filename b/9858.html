She grinned at me again, her smile changing from playful to predatory. Her smile became wide and I knew there would be no stopping her. I was almost tempted to ask for it, but I didn't dare. She started stroking in a steady pace, her hands cupping my neck, her thumbs brushing and twisting the stiffened points that stood out. Her eyes, however, were alight as they studied me.</p> <p>'Are you sure, Master?' I smiled nervously at the way she knew I liked it. I felt confident because I was as much as willing to submit to her as to fuck her body. She started stroking with even more speed and intensity, a sudden shift in her expression that told me she was close to cumming.</p> <p>'I'm close...' I said it quietly, not wanting to betray my own excitement yet. She paused, her fingers stroking me, but not touching. A wicked glint crept into her eyes, she knew it would take time, but she'd make it so. She'd want to watch me get off the moment of orgasm as often as I wanted.</p> <p>'I'm fucking close,' she admitted after a moment and I saw the way her tongue lolled out her lips.</p> <p>'Take it,' I commanded, my voice strong enough that my voice could have sent a signal that she was in for the ride of her life. Her eyes looked up at me as if I was some kind of god she wanted to worship. I looked down at her with an eyebrow cocked upwards and she grinned. Her hands came up to grab my hips and draw me back down onto her waiting tongue.</p> <p>Sheltering in her movements, she moved as though I was a part of the movement, her tongue working in concert with it. I gasped in anticipation as her lips wrapped around my cock and it slid up inside of her hot, wet mouth. I gripped the sheets tightly with both hands, almost afraid that she'd be able to move from her own motions. Her eyes watched me, looking hungry, almost pleading as her tongue slipped inside my mouth, probing and twining with mine.</p> <p>I watched her jaw flex as she sucked my tongue, my body beginning to respond in my seat. She wrapped her lips around my fingers. I could feel her teeth. I moaned as her warm, moist lips closed around them, sucking gently as they moved. They were so good for me as well, I knew even in the midst of a mind blowing erotic experience, she could be so good for my cock. And so she was for me. It didn't take long and my hips moved against her lips. I felt the familiar warm, tingling sensation of cum racing through me. I cried out as the contractions of my cock squeezed against her inner walls and made her tongue twist and dance around my tongue. A gush of cum shot from my shaft and into her mouth. It was so intense. It was the very essence of her, the product and product of pleasure she provided. My body bucked against hers as I came, my fingers tangling in her hair as I kept cumming. The muscles of my legs trembled against the cool sheets. My entire body quivered as pleasure took control of me. As my orgasm wound down, my lips returned to the depths of hers. I couldn't recall ever cumming so hard in my life. She smiled at me as she slowly pulled away, one hand still wrapped around my shaft, one hand teasing and stroking at my balls. They were swollen and heavy.</p> <p>I was about to say something when I felt her soft lips glide upwards to my ear.</p> <p>'Master, may I ask another question?' I turned my gaze downward, the fear gone from my voice.</p> <p>'Of course, pet,' an impish grin spread across her face in the form of her eyes, 'do you have another one of these?' I could feel her hand sliding off of my now flaccid erection.</p> <p>'Yes, Master. I'm ready.'</p> <p>I wondered whether I should have just given it to her or have her use me as she pleased. Instead I gave in to the desire she'd shown me. I sat back and leaned against the headboard of the bed. We could have kissed, or made love, but her answer to my question wasn't until I had completely recovered from the pleasure of my orgasm. It would have been as if we'd been together in another room in two days. And, as much as this was making me think of things I could control from time to time, there were certain things I could do to her that would make her even more desirable to me.</p> <p>I watched her in the mirror, her hips thrust forward towards me, she still holding my softening cock in her hand. Her eyes were dark and fierce, her lips red and swollen on either side, asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
