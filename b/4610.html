I began to rub up her lower legs, gradually moving upward.</p> <p>"Oohhhh, yes," she said, "that feels good."</p> <p>I ran my hand up over her inner thighs and she opened her legs a little and shifted her feet a little.</p> <p>I spread open her legs a little wider and ran one hand up and down her crotch, making sure that I could still see her pussy lips.</p> <p>She moaned as I touched her with my hot fingers and began to slowly rub over and around her vagina. Her hips moved slightly, pushing up to meet my fingers as they slid up and down, and her breathing was getting heavier. "Mmmm," she said, "that feels so good."</p> <p>My breathing started to pick up and my fingers started to move faster around her cunt lips and she responded by pushing her hips up to meet my fingers. "Ohhhh, keep that up," she said.</p> <p>I gently pushed one finger into her and felt for the first time the tight muscle inside her. "Ahhhhhh," she gasped, "yes."</p> <p>That was all it took to bring me to my climax, and I let go of her legs and they fell heavily to my sides as I pumped a steady load of cum towards the ceiling.</p> <p>I turned my head to look at her. "Oh, my, you're such an attractive girl." She smiled and then looked down at herself and said, "you really had me going there."</p> <p>"Ain't that right," I said, "you're really lovely."</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she replied, "that really counts."</p> <p>"Me too," I replied.</p> <p>We lay there talking for a few minutes until she said, "you don't have to go to school tomorrow, do you?"</p> <p>"No, I really don't need to go," I replied, "I just want to get a passport on my way back home."</p> <p>She raised a eyebrow in surprise. "Why don't you stay here for a while," I said, "it'll make me feel even better."</p> <p>"That's sounds like a great idea, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to go without school tomorrow." I leaned over and kissed her lightly on the mouth. "I'm glad about that," I said.</p> <p>We lay together for a long time, but finally I put my arm around her and she pulled her head up to kiss me on the nose. I rolled over and nestled my head next to hers. Her hair fell over my face and she sighed lightly.</p> <p>"God, that was beautiful," she said.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said, "I enjoyed it as well." Then I kissed her on the forehead and she returned the kiss.</p> <p>I was getting sleepy. My body was tired and there wasn't much time left in the day to fall asleep. I took some pills to help me sleep properly and fell asleep fairly quickly. It wasn't until I was on the third period that I felt a change in the bed. I felt it touch my skin and I lifted my head a little to see a lovely shape. It was wearing a pair of slippers with a long, white hair, which I could only see a little over the right temple of her head.</p> <p>"Hey," I said, "you startled me."</p> <p>She laughed, "I don't know why," she said, "but I can feel you in me."</p> <p>"Oh," I said, "I didn't know anyone else could do that." And then, "so, is this yours?"</p> <p>She blushed and replied that it was. "It's yours, sweetheart," she assured me.</p> <p>"So," I said, "does this feel better than the last time you had it?"</p> <p>"No, sweetie," she replied, "although you did seem to have trouble taking it all in. Have you ever had sex like that before?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not really," I replied, "I've had some girls, but they all had to have one or the other afterwards."</p> <p>She sighed a little and said, "I never had any experience in that. Do you want to put your foot down and do some thinking?"</p> <p>I rolled a little closer to her and said, "I'd love to have sex with you but I don't have to be an asshole to do that."</p> <p>"Oh," she said, "but I'm afraid I'll be too sore."</p> <p>I rolled a little closer to her and said, "I thought that being horny would probably be enough reason."</p> <p>"Me too," she said, "but I want you to go back toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
