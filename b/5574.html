We've just got to be safe, and you have my blessing. Please don't hurt me... just have faith that the two of us will be the way we want our lives to be. Now come on, let's get home and clean up and start our new lives... okay?"</p> <p>The first car load arrived at the hospital at about 2 a.m., and the family's first stop was at the grocery store where the boys were picking up food. As the carload returned, they were all loaded up and walking through the door. The second car load went by their parents' residence, and after they were all cleaned up they were ready to resume their journey home. The car load came back at about 6:30 p.m., and the mother's car was at the mall, so the mother's car took that one stop.</p> <p>"Hey Mom, we're on our way home." Said the mother to the oldest. She was about 70 but her body was still in constant need of attention, and her voice was quite sensual.</p> <p>"Hi, Dad! I'm Mom. Sorry about your mom's appearance." She extended her arms. "I'm so glad you came back."</p> <p>"Hey, Mom, thank you. I was worried you would see me after so long." He extended his arm to hers. To be honest, it was a good thing that the hug was as firm as it could be.</p> <p>"Oh, Dad. You still there?" She said.</p> <p>"Yes, mom. What did you think of my visit? I'm having so much fun with you."</p> <p>"Well, you've got a great family." She pulled him into her arms.</p> <p>"Glad you enjoyed it too, mom." He kissed her lips.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
