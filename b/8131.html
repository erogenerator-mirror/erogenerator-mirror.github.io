I replied as my finger was about to make contact with her outer lips. They were a pink, wet, and swollen. "Is it you?"</p> <p>"Yes." She sighed.</p> <p>My finger slipped past her outer lips and over the small bud of her clitoris, and I felt it, then heard it, then felt the tiny nerve endings as it reached the top of my mouth's reach and gently tickled my tongue. The little bud was swollen and aching from the stimulation of the small fingers inside of her.</p> <p>"Let's get comfortable," I said moving up and sitting facing her. I leaned over her and took one of her hardened nipples into my mouth and started to suck it lovingly, feeling her body stiffen involuntarily. I let go of her hard nipple and ran my tongue down along its underside, and as I reached the top of her slit, I stopped again. "Wait."</p> <p>"I could do with a little help." I moved back up and looked at her as her eyes opened to see what I wanted to do. I ran my tongue around the tiny bud again, while stroking the top of her slit with my lips.</p> <p>She shivered and then pushed herself onto my tongue, taking it further. I moved more firmly, and then eased more of her outer lip into my mouth, just barely touching her clitoris. I gently sucked it and she started to grind, pushing her vulva back against my lips.</p> <p>I moved my mouth to hers for more contact, and I was surprised again that she was so wet, not as wet as earlier and only a light sheen of sweat and juice that was beginning to pool there. Her lips opened and she sucked on my tongue, and I eased it a little deeper. Her clitoris was growing larger, and it seemed to reach out to her, and she was moving it back and forth on the bottom lip of my kiss, and she started to pant.</p> <p>I continued my teasing, and she was soon holding my head with both hands, pressing her lips more firmly against mine, and she was kissing me with all the passion and desire she'd only felt in the last several weeks.</p> <p>"Ohh God...Ohh God...," I was surprised and delighted at how much she had given to me in the last several weeks. Then she let out a small cry, as she came. Her clitoris contracted and released, pushing against my mouth, and then she collapsed down on the bed. I moved up next to her, and she pushed up from the bed, kissing my neck and moving her arms around me and her body back toward mine, kissing my lips, my cheeks, my nipples, and then my face. She was still panting and writhing.</p> <p>"I love you, and, we're going to do that again. After all you can be a bad, bad girl and do everything you like, but, after all you were doing for me..." she spoke as she lay back and pushed my hand up to hold her hips in a tight embrace and held me against her as she came again.</p> <p>"Are you sure, baby? I want to do that again. Yes, after you, and after you, and we can have all the pleasure we can do without you being there again, when you are all the way inside me, okay?" Her hips were thrusting gently into my hands as she spoke.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked her as I kissed her lips, and my hands moved up to hold her breasts as she held me, and she held my hands, then looked at me with tears in her eyes.</p> <p>"Yes, you're more than a bit. Let me hold you until you're ready to give back. You do understand, don't you? You really know what you're doing, right?" She held the back of my head lovingly and looked deeply into my eyes. "We're really going to get you in any way you want, you know."</p> <p>I took her hand in mine and put it on the bed on my chest and we rolled toward each other, holding each other tightly. She was trembling.</p> <p>"Let's get a little comfortable and cuddle," I whispered and got off the bed, pulling her from the grip of my arms. She snuggled into me with a sigh as I turned off the water and sat on the bed next to her. "This was nice," I told her after we'd done more kissing and caressing.</p> <p>"Yes, it was," she agreed and kissed me tenderly. "But, I wasn't planning very well for our session...not until we did that."</p> <p>"I have an idea," I told her. "I got up here to the hot tub and got a nice blanket from the guest bed before going to work on my bath.
