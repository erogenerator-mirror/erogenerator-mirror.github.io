I kind of like the fact that we got to know each other and it's nice to finally call him on your anniversary, huh?"</p> <p>Shelly blushed and said "I... uh... it was just kind of nice to have a friend. It wasn't anything bad, it just kind of, well it's not just sex is it, it's just a fun time, like I used to be."</p> <p>After a pause she said "Are you trying to make me sound like a hooker, or whatever?"</p> <p>"Oh... uh, what'd you think?" I said</p> <p>"I... I... I... oh... I'm not a hooker... at all!"</p> <p>"Well you can buy a sex toy or a toy for free now that you know the name of a sex shop!"</p> <p>Shelly looked at me and said "I'm not a hooker so if I'm doing that in front of you I'm sure as hell not a whore!"</p> <p>"I'm so sorry... I guess I just got carried away with just about all the good stuff you have in the store" I said, a little to quickly then quickly followed.</p> <p>"So if you can give me your real address so I can call and cancel this whole thing, if you will just drop by my house instead of at the store..." Shelly's mind raced with possibilities as to how to explain just why she was asking all this. "You should come tomorrow, I could use some help"</p> <p>"Okay, my first day with you?" I said.</p> <p>"I'd like to give you a call next week about what kind of help you could possibly want." she said</p> <p>"That sounds good, maybe I could get to you and talk to you about how to get laid." I said</p> <p>"Really? I could use a friend or something but maybe I wouldn't mind if you talked to one!" She laughed out loud, knowing that I had my own little playroom with plenty of porno and even had a toy store nearby but I never liked her.</p> <p>"Okay, you're on!" I said as I pulled into the parking garage. The day just getting better.</p> <p>The next day started off like any other day of my life for the next month and the fun was just starting up again. I got the new cell phone number and she sent me a list of things to bring out, things she needed to pick up. It was the same for the time I was away this weekend.</p> <p>The next night, and the last time in December and the day before Christmas, I took her shopping while she was on the road. We had a ton of things to pick up and were having a pretty wild weekend. I bought her lingerie especially the little pink lacy ones that you see girls wearing in the movies and she said that she wanted to try it on herself. She even bought a few small bikini style bikinis, one that she said was just so sexy that her whole body tingled when she took it out at the store. That one she bought and that is the one I came to pick up and had a lot of fun in.</p> <p>We went upstairs to the bed and she undid the buttons on her robe so that she could put it on. It fit nicely and the thin straps went all the way up her shoulders so that her tits were a full C and her nipples were poking right through the thin material.</p> <p>"Oops, I... uh... no underwear," I said as she got up and went into the bathroom to get a pair of sweat pants to wear for the night.</p> <p>I got dressed for the walk home, still trying to keep in the conversation to be sure not to look too nervous. The walk was uneventful, only me being a little tipsy, but we went about our own little shopping and she was soon back in her room in just a pair of sweat pants. I grabbed one of her panties and was still trying to keep from glancing at her pussy when she looked over her shoulder and said "What did you think? Do you think I'm sexy?" Without thinking I said that I think she is, just like the way she said the last time we went shopping there. I then pulled on a polo shirt and her hair was up and out and just a little longer than normal.</p> <p>"Mmmm... I think you are sexy as fuck! Just like that girl that gave you that big tip, no underwear!" she said still looking in the mirror at my naked body. As we talked and she tried on the outfit, she did her best to not look like a sex toy.
