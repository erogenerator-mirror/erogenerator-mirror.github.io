"I'm, I'm...I'm not used to calling 'no' that long, I feel it so much, but...I mean...what am I...can I call you 'baby'? You're just as big and hard as I am?"</p> <p>He gave her one more, loving look. "Yes. This is going to be good."</p> <p>With that, he grabbed her hips, pulled her tight into him and began thrusting into her with the full length of his cock, fucking her harder and harder.</p> <p>As his cock drove forcefully into her, she knew it would be so good, so hard and deep, just as it was, for both of them - just as she had been told by his cock to do as he pleased.</p> <p>She felt as though she was falling for him as she loved him so much.</p> <p>He was moving back and forth, driving his cock hard and deep into her pussy.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around him as more and more of his cock, deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper, until the tip of his cock was touching her clit.</p> <p>His eyes were closed as he began fucking her with one, two and three, short thrusts, then two, three in quick, deep strokes. He was in total control, fucking his sister like it was the most erotic and natural thing in the world.</p> <p>And it made her body respond with greater response in response to it.</p> <p>She pushed her body hard into his and felt its own orgasm beginning to build.</p> <p>"Are you....going....to....fuck...me?" she asked, a little unsure. But not really wanting to have to ask.</p> <p>He did not answer right away.</p> <p>After a few seconds, "I think....you want...to be....fuckin' me, do you?"</p> <p>She had stopped moving her body and simply nodded yes.</p> <p>Her head was on his shoulder and she could feel the bed bounce underneath her and the soft material between them.</p> <p>"Want to fuck...I'll stop you if I like too much, you don't think it is going to hurt too much right?" He said gently.</p> <p>"Noooo, it's just that I'm so ready; but you haven't even started yet...." He said, with a laugh, and it was one that she could only hope to feel deep within her as much as he would within her.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how I'll...you know...when we...it...will work out," she said, in a little shaky breath.</p> <p>Her arms instinctively wrapped around his neck, her legs tightened around him as she pressed herself into him, and the sound of their bodies slapping together, made her feel almost like she was crying, and tears were flowing down her cheeks. She could feel the sweat that had collected between them dripping down her face.</p> <p>"What's wrong? You're such a sweetheart."</p> <p>"No no no no, it's not so bad after all," in reply her lips brushing his ear as she pulled her head down to kiss it. She could tell how much her brother loved her.</p> <p>That was the last thing that she felt before she dropped her head back. He was buried to the hilt within her; her hymen had parted and was being held in place by the rigid, but gently stretching shaft that was now within her.</p> <p>As before, he had stopped fucking her then, and was holding back until they both reached the point of no return, just one more thrust, and then she would have a world where her lover would be filling her and not just leaving her. As soon as her body began to betray her, his hands moved from her hips to her ass. He began massaging it as her legs wrapped around him and pulled him to her, which at this point was about as deep as anyone had ever gone in there before.</p> <p>His legs were bent, bent at the knees, his feet planted against the mattress and his calves on her thighs. He could feel her pussy spasming as he held himself. Her body was not moving, and was taking his strokes. She was his, she could tell...and there was no going back now.</p> <p>She had been so close, but so quickly that even the slightest movement, even if she felt like she could still cum, the feeling was not as much a trigger as it had been.</p> <p>But she wanted...and she needed....and she loved, the knowledge that he was there was so much love, yet she was feeling this way when he was fucking her. It was like she was being tied into a knot with both endsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
