He said it so matter-of-factly.</p> <p>"Well . . . that was nice . . ."</p> <p>"But it's not over yet. We're not finished with you yet. I'm gonna give it to you just the way you want it. Do you like that idea?"</p> <p>"Yes!" she said. "I like it!"</p> <p>And that's how I went.</p> <p>I'd had this thought that I'd love every minute of it until I got up the courage to tell her:</p> <p>"It's time to stop."</p> <p>"Yes please," she said.</p> <p>How do I respond to that? I don't know. But you'll get the answer to that question one way or another the next day, and you'll never get it the first time. And then what about you? Will you be able to handle being your best friend's toy? Or maybe you can't. I don't know. For now I want you to be there for me to decide on anything and everything at all time, and to fuck my best friend's hot cunt."</p> <p>"But, I'm going to need a lot more than that. Now you can keep what you've been dreaming about for months, but you're too tired. I'll make the arrangements tomorrow if you'll be up to it."</p> <p>I smiled to myself thinking that she was going to be more than a toy, and her pussy, and so befuddled and tired. Or maybe she was tired from the long wait when it didn't start for her. Either way, now that she's awake and wanting to fuck me, and we're both so tired and stressed on this date, that will be our little secret to keep, I thought. It's only later that I think I'll learn it all. But the rest of it will have to wait.</p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>The next day was a haze of anticipation. This was the start of a long day, the longest day of my life. I was up and ready as I would have been ever, ready to spend my day with my friends. I was feeling like a teenager, ready to play with my girlfriend's pussy until she went off with someone else. Just like the first day. I just loved it.</p> <p>But the anticipation was wearing off fast. Soon she had been left thinking, 'She still wants more.' Well, she started thinking, 'That'll change. This is a whole new side of her. She is becoming a little slut,' and then she was thinking, 'I wonder if I can still tell her I'm not a guy now?' I was thinking that she did wonder if she had been to much of a slut before, but now she was going to get it with a little more practice.</p> <p>After about a six-month, I was still waiting for a chance, though I already had one. The only reason I had to wait that long was that I had to get out of town. So the day seemed to drag on forever. I needed some real excitement.</p> <p>The phone rang around noon. When I answered it I was a bit surprised. It was my girlfriend from work. What was she doing calling me in to pick up another boyfriend?</p> <p>"Yeah, here's him," I said, making sure she said what I thought she was going to say. "No, he's not a guy. He's a guy I haven't been seeing for the last three months, and I'm not sure I trust him right now. I should get back and get ready."</p> <p>What could I possibly want to do when we both agreed that I was in no way in the mood to fuck him, and she was just that little potted plant? Did I really want him?</p> <p>"I'll go with you." I said, and hung up.</p> <p>I went to my room to get my suit and get ready for bed. As I was finishing up I saw myself in the mirror. It looked like a big, fat, slutty body. The front was open but had a few straps and a bunch of buttons undone on the top at one part of it, the rest of it was covered in black pantyhose. The front was open at another part and it had another set of straps and two more buttons running down it. I was a little embarrassed that the stockings were gone already, and that I had put them back on just in case they got wet, but it was a good thing. I had to think it looked like an erotic performance in the mirror to get that reaction. The only problem was I had to buy panties because I didn't want any of the other girls to know what I was looking at. But I got out of the bathroom, dried my hands and went to the window where the shades had been drawn as I went to bed.
