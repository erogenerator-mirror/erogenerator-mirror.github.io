I thought I was your doctor. I'm just an insurance adjuster."</p> <p>The doctor frowned, obviously trying hard to figure out her husband's illness.</p> <p>"That's not true, I told you, but I guess you can tell."</p> <p>"Yes, Doctor, she knows, and I'm not going to tell her about you any more."</p> <p>"We can work something out," the doctor said. "I'm calling an ambulance and getting you to your car. Your mother may not even show up, but I can get you to an emergency room. I'm sure she'll be busy. I'll take charge tomorrow morning at eleven o'clock in the morning. Don't worry, my parents won't be around any more until the following weekend."</p> <p>"Okay. I really had no idea he could be so sweet," she said as she held my hand tightly.</p> <p>"I know, but he's always so sweet."</p> <p>"I'll call him later," she said and then she turned to me.</p> <p>"I'll be in the back bedroom with you."</p> <p>She smiled at me as she got up and headed for the car. I watched her ass sway as she skipped through the door on her way to her vehicle. Her ass was fantastic for a 42 year old female. She always had a cute ass every once in a while. I had to shake my head as I thought about why she was talking to me; "My mind is in the toilet" as I had once told her. She must know that, because she always did those old school stories at me. She was not only my ex, I was her teacher at the college. So maybe a blow job was coming along, right?</p> <p>"Good morning," she said to me as she bent down to pick up my phone.</p> <p>"Good morning, ma'am, I had a bad day yesterday."</p> <p>I could feel myself getting hard in my pants.</p> <p>"I'm going to take off early this morning, and you'll get to see what kind of day it is."</p> <p>"Okay!" was all I could speak as she started the car and headed out of the parking lot.</p> <p>"What kind of day?" she asked me.</p> <p>"My day with your father again. And you know, as I recall the last time I made love with him, I started thinking that would be better if I took my time."</p> <p>"I thought you didn't like me in any way," she said.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I'm just your father," I replied.</p> <p>I guess she knew exactly what I meant.</p> <p>"I love you too," I said.</p> <p>"Thank you," she laughed.</p> <p>At nine o'clock, the doctor showed up with a nurse on his arm. She said everything would be all right. A little after one, I heard the helicopter begin to take off out of the airport.</p> <p>We got out of bed, dressed, and I put on fresh clothes and went through my paperwork. I checked out, and we were on our way to my father's house. The nurse took the bag I had just bought from her into the back of my car and I went to the hospital. She did not have to wait long before my man was calling to her from the intercom.</p> <p>"Good morning, sweetheart. I don't think you'll be needing the car today?"</p> <p>"No, Doc, I'll be fine. I was just going to take a cab. Why?"</p> <p>"Just going to your father's first aid office, and checking to see what the hell your condition is. I thought you'd never get a good night's sleep so your parents would be asleep by now."</p> <p>"Thank you, Doc, I had no idea. Have no idea how you do it."</p> <p>"There's no need, I have it under control. I am glad you're having a good rest," she said, as she sat me next to my father's bed.</p> <p>I sat there looking down at a man in the hospital bed for a little while. It took me by surprise. My Dad was dead. I wondered what he got himself into. I just sat there, looking at the clock, wondering what the hell was wrong with me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I thought to myself. "I wish I could do something."</p> <p>"Don't you wish you could sit there all night?" He laughed as he looked me up and down.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed my forehead.</p> <p>"You don't regret what I did, do you? I'm not going to get too deep on you."</p> <p>"I have regrets too," I said in my best John Wayne imitation.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm afraidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
