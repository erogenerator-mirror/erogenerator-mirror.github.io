"Don't you think? What about your hair?"</p> <p>She grinned. "They don't work when they're in your face, so I'm thinking it will be easier to use them when we're alone."</p> <p>"Do that again and you'll get even," I said. "Just so long as you don't get too sore."</p> <p>"It gets wet?" she said. "I don't really mind, and sometimes I get horny."</p> <p>"It's always wet if I'm near," I said. "I'm going to dry your hair and then we'll go upstairs and start making out."</p> <p>"Hurry up," she said. She stood in front of me. "After all these years, I can't wait anymore." Then she turned and left. She locked the door. She had her hand out, ready for my hand.</p> <p>I pulled both hands together. "Mm — you're beautiful," I said.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Well, you're beautiful like this. What's wrong, is that all?"</p> <p>"I can't stand another minute of your hands touching me. I just want you to go for it."</p> <p>"That will do, won't it?"</p> <p>She took my hands and stood up. I started at her face, from her earlobe up to the tip of her nose. Then I kissed her mouth. She opened it and let me in. I took in her skin — soft, plump but smooth to my touch. She moaned.</p> <p>"I think I like it," she said.</p> <p>I stepped behind her, and grabbed her hands from behind her back. I lifted her, one hand to hold her, so I could kneel again. As soon as my face touched hers, I felt her hips move. I stepped back to admire her from the back and saw her standing like she'd been a good girl. I ran my fingers over her breasts.</p> <p>"You have such a great body," I said. I didn't bother to add that I had been fantasizing about this for a while. "All those years, I have never actually seen the way that girl could turn down a man."</p> <p>I stood before her. I wanted to kiss her right there and get her wet.</p> <p>"It's not that I don't like you," I said. "I really don't. I just didn't have the heart to ask. I have no experience with dating women."</p> <p>She looked at me.</p> <p>"I want to make you a man," she said.</p> <p>I had never done that before but I wasn't in love with kissing a girl. I wanted to kiss her. I wanted to hold her all night.</p> <p>"I don't want to get any." I turned her around and held her against me. She leaned against me.</p> <p>"This is how it's done," I said. "Your breasts are just perfect and, when you let you down, you'll be completely naked or there's always going to be someone there for you."</p> <p>I could feel the tears of desire seep out of her eyes. I moved my body to take off my pants. My own penis was rigid, but when I looked at her face I could feel that she wasn't really crying, but I could feel her body trembling. I wanted to make love to her, to take her into my apartment and just hold her forever. I wasn't sure where this would all go, exactly. But I couldn't seem to get enough of her. I could feel my heart beating through my dick and it sent a throbbing sensation up my abdomen into my head and I ached to kiss her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I said those words," she said. "I'm sorry I'm not as brave right now as I am right now. I really don't think I can give you this. I'm not a woman for you."</p> <p>I kissed her cheek. "I won't say no. I just think you're beautiful. I don't blame you for being a girl. I would go through life with girls, even if it's because a man's doing it to women. That's not a problem for me. I have a girlfriend and I wouldn't trade her for anything."</p> <p>I moved to stand between her legs and took them in my hands. When I leaned my head forward, though, my face touched hers. I kissed her lips. I was surprised that her lips were so soft. I thought they were sexy, too.
