As the song finished you let down your head, then you turned and leaned over the arm of the sofa, your skirt riding even higher on your thighs and your stocking tops were visible. As you turned I was rewarded with a perfect view of your cleavage, which you had covered up by pulling your blouse down under your breasts.</p> <p>Before I could finish my song, you dropped to your knees in front of me and said, "Let's have a dance, I've missed this song!" She then stood up and began to dance in a fluid, fluid, fluid motion. Not to lose the place you had been dancing in, but instead you let go of your skirt with one of your hands as if to keep your breasts on display, but instead of sliding it down from your shoulder to the small of your back, her eyes kept going back up to meet mine.</p> <p>With your skirt over your shoulder and your breasts fully on display, she leaned down to meet your lips for those long lingering kiss. When our mouths opened, her tongue slid over mine and I could feel my own breath becoming a little faster. We quickly found a rhythm and each of us tried to pull the other closer to our lips and mouths. Our tongues danced together and she brought her lips back over mine and as our kiss deepened you closed the gap and pressed your lips firmly against mine. The feeling of your lips on mine was electric and sent thrills in both of our movements as we melted together into the most intense feeling of ecstasy that could be experienced. The kiss ended and a moment later we were holding each other tightly and moaning into each other's mouths.</p> <p>I broke the kiss and said, "God honey, that was fantastic, I don't want this to ever end." She giggled and said she would call me some time for more dancing lessons, and that she wanted to dance with me before heading home. We embraced in the living room, each of us getting comfortable again to enjoy the feeling of being together again. I gave her a quick kiss on her cheek and the kiss was over quickly and was lost in the smell of her as our tongues danced together. I could not resist her and ran the tip of the finger across the upper swell of her left breast, and again she moaned her approval while the nipple reacted to the touch, rock hard. I slipped my hand to the outside of her blouse and with a groan of pleasure, ran it down between her breasts and over her stomach and finally up over her belly and onto her waist. I moved my hand upwards until I could feel her sex, which I quickly moved into a position to press into my palm as it lay over her crotch. With an eager expression on her face, she lifted out of the chair, leaned over the arm of and lifted her ass over the left armrest, and I quickly inserted my middle finger into her and she moaned her approval.</p> <p>I was so wet, I thought she might have a wet patch on her blouse and skirt. With a grunt I inserted my index finger deep into her. I heard her moan as she was stretched with my finger. With a groan, I heard her say, "Yes baby, finger me just like that, it feels sooooo good." With that she reached back with both hands, slid her blouse and bra off slowly, and dropped them to the floor. Her hands went back up and she caressed the outside of her breasts. Her hand ran up and down her chest and I watched her fingers dip into the large mound and she moved to stroke the sensitive nipple.</p> <p>After a short while I moved my hand under the waistband of her skirt, up her right leg and stopped to gently push her panties off. I slid my fingers up along her labia and ran them over her slit once more before pulling them into my mouth and sucking a little on each one until I pulled her wetness onto my fingers and rubbed her clit with her other hand. In and out and as I started to speed up I felt her pussy tighten around my fingers that were now covered in her juices.</p> <p>As she felt my fingers in her, she said that it felt wonderful, and I said to continue if you want me to do anything else for you. "If you want me to stop I can leave but I don't want to spoil what we just did, you can stay if you want." And she just grinned at me, opened her legs a bit, and said, "Of course. But if you want to you can stop anytime, because I want you to feel amazing, too please no more." The smile on her face made it plain she meant it and I couldn't tell if she meant it or not.</p> <p>With that she pulled me up to kneel in front of her and started toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
