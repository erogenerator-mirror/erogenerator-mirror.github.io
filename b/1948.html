I had no idea that my own personal opinion mattered as much as hers. I was afraid for her safety but also concerned. I was still deeply disturbed by her being so adamant that she had only had sex with me in the past, when we had been friends.</p> <p>"How do you think it'll have looked, at least, to see our friends getting together, for the weekend?"</p> <p>"I don't know. That's just the kind of question I need an answer to." And after some moments, she replied, "Oh, there was the time... in the woods. I didn't know that..."</p> <p>"It was a one night stand. That's what you got in there with you when you were young, right?"</p> <p>And that's it! I can't believe how much I enjoyed being with her."</p> <p>"That doesn't bother you?"</p> <p>When it finally hit me that she didn't feel at all embarrassed about something that she had done or had wanted to do, I started to relax and I agreed to meet her. I knew, though, that we would be meeting again.</p> <p>"So what time do you want to arrive?" Alex asked, trying to be a friend, but not really, "Well, if you don't mind, I might be a little late, if you don't mind."</p> <p>I considered it for a moment, not knowing what to do. How could I decline her request? She had made it clear that she was going to tell me on Wednesday that she had come as far as she wanted to go and she said that she was going to meet me at the hotel on Friday.</p> <p>It must be true. I was very nervous. I was hoping that it would just be us two, alone - and maybe, just maybe, they'd go at it.</p> <p>I considered the logistics for how I would be able to spend the next few evenings. I might not have to see her again for the weekend, perhaps, but I wouldn't have to meet her for several weeks.</p> <p>I considered getting away from the room so I could talk to her, about just a visit with her for several days. It would mean a little more privacy at her place, and I think that would be really nice. But that's not the whole story.</p> <p>"You'll have to wait for us, then. We haven't decided, but it just had to be tonight."</p> <p>"I really like you, Paul," she said - I didn't know what I was going to say about it, "so why would I want to go by myself tonight... I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"It's not even going to be a date. I want to do dinner, of course. But I'll do things... well... like you can do."</p> <p>I was thinking, "OK..." but I had to think what to do about that. First, I wanted to wait until she was ready (yes, we'd talk about dinner later), but second, I had to think of something that would impress her - perhaps, she might give up her decision after she's gone.</p> <p>Alex was a little late.</p> <p>"Don't be mad. You're the one that I feel responsible for."</p> <p>There came a little awkwardness in there. Was she nervous? I was sure that she was just trying to please me. She wasn't trying to rush me or anything. She had waited longer than usual. That really wasn't an option.</p> <p>"Do you really mean that?" I asked. I thought I saw her blush a little. As I sat there, drinking a glass of wine, thinking about how close she had just come, Alex said, "Well, it's been so long since I've had a boyfriend" - she was so direct - "that I just don't want to let things get out of hand. I think it's time we were alone to talk about things."</p> <p>She moved toward the table. She seemed more nervous than I'd realized.</p> <p>"I'm sure you said you wanted to wait until I was ready?"</p> <p>"I have no idea what happened. I had been in a hurry to leave, and when I saw you - I didn't need to say goodbye - I was afraid... I told you ... what happens... stays between us."</p> <p>I was surprised at that. "You're probably right, but we can't stop. Is it really all right? She said - she was right. I think that it's important for us to waitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
