And then I had fun too.</p> <p>When I awoke, it was a light day. I had showered and dressed in record time, having to get up to the door before dawn to reach the road I had taken the bus to yesterday. I was nervous about what had transpired.</p> <p>I was wearing jeans and a tee shirt, but I was still naked as a jaybird, but I looked incredibly sexy in the sunlight and was still horny. I was still fully dressed and horny. I felt horny.</p> <p>"Get in, I have to go," I said quietly as I opened the door.</p> <p>"Good to see you," she said as she came up to me and embraced me with her arms.</p> <p>I was wearing a sleeveless summer dress shirt, and she had on a white blouse under a navy blue blazer. The sleeves were long and I was wearing shorts. I kissed her cheek and then she looked down the length of my body and smiled at me with an expression that was one of wonder. Her eyes ran up my legs which were still somewhat shapelied from earlier. My cock twitched on someplace and she noticed.</p> <p>"You look great, yourself," I said with a smile in my voice.</p> <p>"Well yes you do," she whispered, a little shyly. "You look beautiful."</p> <p>The two of us stepped out into the warm sunshine and the air was warm and crisp. I noticed a pair of bright blue sneakers on the grass next to the road.</p> <p>"If I can stay the night," I asked. "How about tomorrow?"</p> <p>"That would be great," she said. "I know a place I can shower in and then meet me there."</p> <p>"That sounds great, maybe tomorrow," I said. "I'll be staying at the campus."</p> <p>"That's great," she said and held out her hand to me. Her hand felt soft and smooth on mine. I felt nervous.</p> <p>We kissed on the lips again on the cheek. I thought of the last time we had done this and I enjoyed that experience. It was fun, but not exciting.</p> <p>"We better get going," she said, grabbing her things to come out into the morning sunlight.</p> <p>"I'm not going anywhere until you're gone," I said as I held her hand and walked down the street.</p> <p>I couldn't look her in the eye the whole way. I felt a little guilty about being the center of her attraction, yet she felt nice when I was at peace.</p> <p>She had the usual casual outfit for a campus dinner: jeans and an open-top sweatshirt, dark brown sweater and a dark blue pleated skirt that came down to mid-calf. I knew I was going to look good for the first time this summer.</p> <p>She had her back to me, sitting in one of the large dining room chairs, which allowed her legs to spread.</p> <p>"Well, we're back," she said as she turned her chair and I noticed they were as short as they had been before I got home.</p> <p>We ate and then I helped her into the back seat of her car. She pulled in the garage, closed the door then pulled me into the back seat with her. I immediately felt the warmth of her body and the smell of the perfume she was wearing. It was so sensually fragrant.</p> <p>"Let's have dinner in bed," she said and we kissed once, again as I got out of the car with her.</p> <p>It felt so nice to be in her arms and I realized that it would be easy to feel again if I could take her up to bed, but my cock said otherwise. I thought that I was going to want a repeat of our first night at the dorm and we could find out about one another. We kissed in the restaurant's parking lot.</p> <p>Chapter 26.4</p> <p>I don't know whether we talked about it, but we didn't talk about going to sleep until late in the night. Of course I was feeling very horny. Her softness when she kissed me this morning was fantastic. Our kisses were so light and tender that I thought I would pass out right then.</p> <p>We spent the night in bed, and I did it so gently, kissing, caressing and holding her with my hands.</p> <p>We kissed for hours and I was so lost in her eyes when she finally spoke first.</p> <p>"Let's make love right here in the back seat of my car," she said, turning towards me. "I'm still in the mood."</p> <p>Without waiting for the invite, she got out of bed and went into the living room to retrieve a bottle of wine as I followed her, takingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
