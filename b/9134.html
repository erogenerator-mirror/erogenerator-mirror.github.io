"There is some nice photos on the back as well", he said. "It'll be interesting to see what you and she will look like together, she'll definitely notice that the two of you aren't alone."</p> <p>Looking over the photos I felt my heart begin to pick up speed and excitement began to build in my body. I just barely caught the words 'girl will be alone' in the book but it didn't take much more to hear them before I heard her calling out. "That's lovely!"</p> <p>"Come and see, I'm sure we can find something that will turn her on!" I heard her say, smiling. There was no way she was going to get off quickly again.</p> <p>I turned my attention back to the book and started to read, picturing in my mind the various poses she would like to try out. Her body began to heat up, and slowly I pulled my fingers back and read on as if I wasn't there. I heard her moan quietly a few times as I kept reading and I felt her pussy contract around my cock as she reached over and rubbed her tits against it.</p> <p>Her voice was getting louder and stronger each time she said "Yes, yes, yes, yes" over and over in a rhythmic chant that I guess she meant. "Can you make me come?"</p> <p>"Not yet. We'll have to keep up our pace."</p> <p>"Oh god! I'm so close!" she yelled.</p> <p>I could tell that her body was responding to my words by moving faster against the wall as her voice continued getting louder. If I hadn't had my camera I might have walked out of the room at that point and never again heard her voice again. Then she cried out to another climax and I couldn't keep silent either. I lifted my head so that I could see her face then quickly closed the book once she finished.</p> <p>"Can you keep fucking me in this chair?"</p> <p>I didn't need telling twice and I lifted my hips and pulled my cock out of her pussy. We both looked at it and wondered where it had gone. "You're just being a dirty girl," I said to her.</p> <p>She started to laugh then. "You are such a dirty girl."</p> <p>"No I'm not. I'm making love to your pussy."</p> <p>I didn't know what to think. I really needed to know if that was true because every time I tried to tell her to not leave I felt that all the words just went through my mind. Then she reached back and squeezed my balls.</p> <p>"Oh yes, you're making me come!"</p> <p>And with that we both heard the sound of the door closing. I felt sorry for the guy that stayed out for that period of time.</p> <p>I tried to reach up and touch his face as she did the same to me and we both looked at each other with big grins on our faces. "What do you think?" she asked him with a laugh.</p> <p>"I thought you might let him feel your tits. You have great tits"</p> <p>"Nice and firm and soft."</p> <p>I looked down the front of my shirt to see if his comment was in anyway true, and I could see that he had a large tent in his trousers that seemed to be straining to be released and it didn't help that I was a little nervous about how it would be when she and I got together.</p> <p>To my surprise, before I knew it she had already undone the buttons on my shirt and she was running her hands all over my chest. Then I felt her lips on my bare chest and she lifted one of her tits to my mouth where I licked her nipple and she squealed in pleasure as I put her nipple back in its place.</p> <p>I could have stayed there and been content with just the feel of her lips and her hands, but instead I started to kiss my way down her body. I felt her body shaking beneath me when my lips found her bush, and I moved my face along it to feel the soft flesh and the smooth skin. I could smell her, and I could feel her juices as I moved my tongue along her lips and slowly, gently slid it in as far as I could. I could taste the soft, salty aroma of her on my tongue and I pulled her to me so that she lay flat on the floor with her legs splayed wide.</p> <p>My tongue searched her pussy like it was going to get inside it and she gasped as I teased her.</p> <p>"Come here and lick me!" She said. "Don't make me wait any longer. Fuck me now!"</p> <p>I sat on the floor in front of her and took the time to enjoy as my nose pressed against her clit and I sucked on her pussy lips while slowly pushing my tongue as far as it would goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
