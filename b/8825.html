I asked her.</p> <p>"I'm fine. I just wish you had come home faster."</p> <p>"I just hope they didn't take all the pills?"</p> <p>"You know they probably don't," she said without looking up from the TV.</p> <p>"No I don't," I said quickly.</p> <p>"Are you coming home tonight, baby?" she said.</p> <p>"No I thought maybe some other time," I answered her as my penis grew hard again.</p> <p>"I can get rid of this," she said with a big smile. She handed me a glass of wine as I sat back. Her lips brushed mine as our lips met again. She moved to the middle of the couch and lay down along side me. She turned to the side away from me and looked down at me from my lap as my hard cock slowly came fully erect.</p> <p>"I've missed you like this," she said before kissing me again.</p> <p>"I missed you too," she said as she pressed her moistened lips to mine.</p> <p>A kiss from a good, kind man never happens when you're young but now I want to take control of our lovemaking. I can't just hold her in my arms all day long. She's going to make me cum soon. I can still feel it in her belly as our lips parted, still kissing each other in our lust. I ran my fingers through her hair as we began to move together.</p> <p>We started kissing and caressing each others bodies slowly. Our hands were on each other's buttocks as we teased the others skin and feeling each others breasts and pussies together. Her clit was in my hand and I was teasing it with my finger.</p> <p>Her juices had started pouring down my face as we moved together. The feeling was amazing. I thought she wasn't wet like we were, and it was turning me on that she did this to herself but she was doing it also. As we rubbed each other's body, she was so soft. The feeling of her softness as she rubbed my cock made me feel so good and sexy. I didn't want her to stop. I felt her moving her fingers against the swollen cock head just behind the head of my shaft. She touched herself without asking and it felt very good as she started to stroke me slowly. I slid one of my fingers between her lips as she stroked me. "Please don't stop, sweetheart," I said as her middle finger found my clit under the outer lips.</p> <p>Her finger moved over the sensitive head of my cock. It was so swollen it was already swollen and standing out hard. "I'm ready for you now," she said.</p> <p>Her finger touched my clit as her other hand continued to rub and tease me at the same time. I thought I was going to cum before she did. I let it happen as she played my clit. The feelings built up from her finger on my clit to my clit rubbing and moving it. My hips started to move and grind back and forth slowly and deliberately. I couldn't hold back any longer, I had to have her in between me, right there in our bed. My hands were already moving to her breasts so I had no problem.</p> <p>"Oh yes, oh god yes," I said as she moved more on me. She moved down the bed to straddle me as I lifted my hips to accommodate her movement. My fingers were still playing inside her pussy as she slowly sat down on my still swollen cock.</p> <p>"I've missed you so much," she said as she moved her hips back and forth feeling all of me inside her.</p> <p>"I know," I said before she began to move. It felt even better than I had dreamed. "You feel so good."</p> <p>"Oh god, I like that," she responded.</p> <p>She reached down to my crotch, where my shaft had been and found my hard cock as she sat down. My hand was massaging her breasts as I moved my hips up and down her body with her and found her pussy with my cock.</p> <p>Her warm pussy was wet. It was the best feeling of the whole weekend, with lovemaking and orgasm, and all the same with lovemaking and orgasm. My head was spinning with desire as she began to rock back and forth on the end of my cock and me as she moved up and down.</p> <p>"Oh yes, you feel so good," I said as I cupped her breasts with my hands.</p> <p>We had started slow, but we were so horny from feeling each others bodies and to our last orgasms together that we couldn't take any more.</p> <p>"Oh yes, oh god," I said breathlessly as I felt my orgasm rising. My hips jumped off the bed as my head lolled back.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, oh god yes," was allâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
