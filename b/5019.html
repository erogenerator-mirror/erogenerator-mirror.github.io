We finally finished it with the park site ready to be finished in ten months' time. I was going to start the business.</p> <p>By the end of our first month, the park had a big success story. We had a lot of people coming and going who enjoyed it while we gave it to them. One evening, the manager of the park came in to tell us he would return home the following weekend. He was due in at the end of the week to visit a friends family in England. We agreed that we would take this to the big point.</p> <p>The park was built for a year. One of the people, who did most of the planning, had told us that the park was used as an office. It was then that we decided that we needed to start the 'landing' of the Park. The property line had been cleared of trees and bushes. There was lots of lawn surrounding the property, but we had to have the trees in park. We also used the first two floors of the property to have a good area for the park. We had a lot of time to build it, and I was planning a big, new, indoor swimming pool and a pool house.</p> <p>We were going to build a swimming pool, which we owned, with the owner's idea. We were considering it one of our own private properties when my friend Mike came to check on how he could spend a weekend in California for a few months.</p> <p>One thing led to another; Mike found out that we planned to rent his property for a year. I thought to myself that he might as well have paid us a price if we were going to do this thing.</p> <p>Mike showed up at our house for about an hour just before he got the contract. Mike said we had done a lot considering the prices we had agreed on. He was also right, our house had a lot of money in it. I had been working at the store when Mike came over and was sitting in my office watching the sign on the doors, when I got that call. I had a lot of paperwork to do and needed to do it right by the door. I called Mike on his cell phone.</p> <p>"Hi Mike, where are you?"</p> <p>"I'm about halfway home."</p> <p>"What's up?"</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?"</p> <p>I had the call forwarded to him and I started the job of fixing the sign. It could not be done without doing it right out of his control.</p> <p>"I didn't give you permission to use the sign?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>I was listening to him talk about that while I was working on the back of the truck. He would tell me how great I was and it would be fun to see the look on his face when he saw me there.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?"</p> <p>"Put off all the work."</p> <p>"But I work all the time. I want more time."</p> <p>"Do it!"</p> <p>"But you're my supervisor, I don't really want to do this."</p> <p>"All I want to do is sit on the front porch and plan that."</p> <p>At that point, Mike had given me permission to do it; I was in uncharted waters. He had made reservations at his friend's house. I called him and told him we had a few choices. The second we stopped, I had taken him home and set up the pool and it had become a very popular part of the park. Mike told me he would set up the equipment. I said I would give Mike time to be sure he did not mess things up.</p> <p>Mike went over to the gate, made sure there were cameras and the sign up front that was supposed to go in, and went in through the gate. He gave me his address and said the pool would be in his garage and that I would set up the security camera at home. My guess was he wasn't going to have enough time with the equipment to cover all the features there but he still had an idea.</p> <p>When I got ready to go home, I stopped and gave Mike my cell phone. He started the camera as I was coming out to get my keys. I grabbed a pen and some paper and wrote the address on a napkin and slid it under the back of my chair, then looked up at Mike.</p> <p>"That's my address."</p> <p>"I thought that was your address."</p> <p>"It's actually his house, but his buddy Mike says I got home the other end. He's probably just taking advantage of free rent that's all."</p> <p>Mike was surprised by the tone of my voice as I was talking in his mind, but he came off as friendly.
