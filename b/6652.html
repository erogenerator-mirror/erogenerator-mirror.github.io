If you want, you could get yourself off," she said with a smile. There was that 'nudge' word again, and this time she gave me a wry look.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Don't even think that," she said, "You've done this a million times already. Maybe it is time you found out. Go get your vibe."</p> <p>She reached back to the wall for another vibe—we don't need to turn around and get a towel with it, do we. I can't let her do it. I've been so worried about myself. "You can go. Here, you just take the vibe, and put on your robe. Now. Get yourself off, and get the vibe. Hurry."</p> <p>She gave me a stern look, and I nodded. I went downstairs and walked into the bedroom. I felt so exposed with the towel wrapped around me, but I was feeling so damn sexy. I felt my pussy getting wetter with each step. I slid the vibe down the leg of my robe and stood right in front of the mirror. "I love how it feels on my pussy," I thought to myself—it's like I could see my vagina in the mirror from somewhere in the house. There was nothing hidden, only the soft wet pink and purple labia that seemed to sparkle and glisten in the light. My tits swung freely from side to side with each step I took up the stairs to my bed. I was in a world of my own.</p> <p>I stepped lightly into my room, and put the vibe on. It was so small, but I was so wet that I was ready. I looked at myself in the mirror. The small thing fit all the way around with the little vibe sticking out like a finger. I got the picture. This was the moment I was waiting for.</p> <p>I moved the vibe between my legs in anticipation of what might happen. I rubbed it up and down the outside of my pussy lips. I could feel the slight vibration on my clitoris. I thought of the first time I touched myself, getting it in the car. It never did it for me, but now, it seemed like it would be so very good. The next time, it would just be me, a stranger.</p> <p>I rubbed the vibe on the hood of my clit. My pussy lips were slick and slippery. I ran the tip of the vibe along my outer lips before sliding it forward a little bit, so my clit was almost out. I could feel the heat of it. My lips were just barely parted to let me get a little access, and I felt the vibe slide slowly back and forth over me. The vibe felt really good sliding into me. I could feel it deep inside me. It felt warm, and oh so wet. I pressed into the sensation and was just about ready to cum. The second time, it felt incredible, and I couldn't stand it any more.</p> <p>I pushed the vibe hard against my vagina.</p> <p>"I'm close," I said.</p> <p>"Fuck it, I want to feel you cum," she said.</p> <p>I reached for the rabbit with my other hand as I pushed the tip of the vibe into the hot opening of my pussy.</p> <p>"I'm fucking cumming," I said.</p> <p>My pussy tightened around the vibe. The rabbit felt great. It was just what I needed to cum. I put on a show for her, trying to get the vibe into me while giving her a little display of my own pleasure. My pussy and my clit were both soaking with her desire, so intense was the feeling. I couldn't stop myself. When I finally had my orgasm, I collapsed down on the bed in exhaustion. I thought about the next time, when I wanted to feel, not only my vibrator in me, but all the toys I could imagine I would use that night, I imagined. Just so long as it wasn't my vibrator, it could stay inside me, right there, right at my opening or anywhere else. I realized I just wished it was my toy. That's all I said, at least to myself. After that incredible encounter, I had to decide what I wanted for me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
