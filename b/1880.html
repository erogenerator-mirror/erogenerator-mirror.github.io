I needed in heaven. I knew it.</p> <p>"Do your other leg too." I said. "And do the rest too." She did.</p> <p>She was getting turned on and I had no idea how but the thought sent shivers through me.</p> <p>"Can I cum?" I asked her. She nodded yes. And again, I saw her look at her tits. "Can I cum?" and again, she nodded yes.</p> <p>I stroked her boobs and then rubbed both hands over her pussy and thighs.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh." She pushed her face into the grass and arched her back, then went limp. I kept rubbing her clit as the waves of pure ecstasy flooded through her body, she was just writhing, I was fascinated by the way it looked and how it felt.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." I said, my face wetting with her juices. She looked like a beautiful angel. I put my finger in my mouth and got her to taste it. The taste was heavenly and I couldn't stand to be left at it.</p> <p>I sat back on my heels and lifted her legs to my face, she moaned with desire and said, "yes."</p> <p>"Then I have to taste myself there," I said, and lifted her legs to my mouth and began licking her clit again, her whole body jolted. I did everything, I loved doing everything. She moaned, arched and spread her legs wider.</p> <p>And then I put both her legs over my shoulders and ate her out, the taste, the smell, and the way she arched on the grass with my tongue was almost more than I could bear. I loved that feeling of control. And what she didn't love was a strong orgasm but I had a hard time not doing all that. I licked her thighs, her pussy walls and even between her lips, it was enough for her to moan and sigh with pleasure as I ate her.</p> <p>After several minutes, she seemed to be in very deep relaxation, I went to her pussy once more with my tongue. And again, she arched and pushed. I did my best at the same time, but soon I realized one of the fingers was not in its usual place, I was not able to bring it, I was having to use both hands and I didn't want them to fail.</p> <p>"Now can I cum?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Yes." I said. "Fuck yourself when you do cum. I'm hungry, maybe I'll put on a condom."</p> <p>She looked at me. I was wondering how I could look her up and down once more without showing any sign of loosing control of my cock. I pulled out of her and lay beside her. She lay on her side and looked at me, her eyes were wet and glowing. I put my finger in her mouth and she sucked it. She came for me when I kissed her and tasted myself, then kissed me and we fucked again before falling asleep.</p> <p>I awoke late into the night with a smile.</p> <p>It was Sunday, the day of my birthday. I took off my pajama and slept nude, I found the condom and went into the bathroom and jerked myself off. I couldn't help looking at myself in the mirror. The sight of my hard cock flopped in the mirror like a pendulum, I smiled and went back into the bedroom.</p> <p>She was asleep, I put a blanket around her body and looked at her. Her hair was still damp, I smiled. I went to my room and got changed, lay on the bed and got myself in bed, she stirred with me.</p> <p>"So, what does your day be?" she said.</p> <p>"Today is tomorrow. Tomorrow will comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
