"Nah. I need to get my stuff and get going. This place's so busy."</p> <p>"It'll be about two hours."</p> <p>"I'm just going on one of my run-ins with a co-ed."</p> <p>Gods I'm sure you've thought through your line of thinking!</p> <p>"Sorry I didn't ask. You should have come in here in the future." She giggled loudly.</p> <p>"How could I go on a Saturday?!?" I wasn't complaining, at least not in my mind.</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>I was really confused now, why she invited herself here to do this. My life had seemed all set-up before we met. She had been the one to make the choice to stay. Well actually she had only been there five days or so and I really should have asked her back. But there was none here and yet here she was and I wondered if she'd go with me. She was pretty and sweet and I'd bet something's up when she got more comfortable and I wanted to do the same. Besides, I wanted to see what she did for the rest of her college years. Plus it helped get me to the university with her now.</p> <p>I couldn't do this and she had asked me for help in the past, so I figured just to do it this time as it's easier now. I took in the apartment I had and turned to head for the fridge.</p> <p>She was in one of the kitchen counters, fixing some soup.</p> <p>"Well here's to us," she said as she picked a small plate up and leaned against the counter, looking at me through the top. "I'll have the rest of my stuff ready in 30 minutes."</p> <p>I sat on the stool beside her.</p> <p>"Where is your car?"</p> <p>"It's right here in the garage."</p> <p>"There?"</p> <p>"It's in the garage, in my truck if you need it."</p> <p>"Are you driving a brand new car?"</p> <p>"No, just my old car. I'm working on it and it's about time I show you what else makes me happy."</p> <p>I smiled. This woman could make me happy and I could be happy living my life. "Well, it's a new Mustang. And, you might ask why I brought a new one with me. I can tell when I see you that, or that car when I'm around you, that you're in the mood to have something new."</p> <p>"That's not why I'm bringing it, though it would save me a little time."</p> <p>"That's nice."</p> <p>"I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to bring it with me or should make it in case I was in the mood to do something that I'd have to get out myself."</p> <p>She leaned back into the counter. "Well, no one says you can't get away with it. But, I won't argue with you."</p> <p>I stood and walked over to her, putting my arms around her as she leaned against the wall. We kissed like we hadn't kissed in years. The way our tongues battled against one another was one of my favorites. It would be hard to explain. She pulled away suddenly. And when she did, I wanted her more than ever.</p> <p>"Well let's see what you have for me."</p> <p>She stood and turned off a light. "Take a quick shower and put your clothes, and yours on the bed. Then come into the bedroom with me. We can talk some more and see if we can work this out. And see how I feel about living your life."</p> <p>She reached out and pulled me with her, taking each step. When I was standing in front of her I held her as if we were going to dance again. "I want you to know I never thought of you as a woman that could do that," I whispered as I leaned forward and kissed her. She leaned back as I pushed her to the bed on her knees.</p> <p>I slowly undid the buttons of her blouse before reaching around to unzip her black skirt, letting it slide down her legs. When I took it off her legs, I kissed them and then lay her on the bed and lay my eyes on her. I leaned over her and we kissed, first one lip, then the other, and finally our tongues entwined. For a moment I held my breath as she pushed her body upwards toward me.</p> <p>"That's perfect." It took me a few seconds to realize what she was talking about, the way she called me by my last name. "That feels so good."</p> <p>I bent my neck and kissed her and she did the same, until Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
