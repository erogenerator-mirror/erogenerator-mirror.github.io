She took down her panties and dropped them into my pocket. "There," she said, smiling at me, "Now let's sleep."</p> <p>She lay down as we snuggled, spoon-fashion. "So I guess last night was pretty memorable."</p> <p>"It was. I think there is going to be a lot more to it. Especially at your school on Monday night."</p> <p>She laughed. "I never said I was going to ask Dad when we got back to the house."</p> <p>"Then get some sleep, then we should spend the rest of the night cuddled together like an old friend," I said.</p> <p>"Do you think it will come in handy tonight?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know." I said. "I guess it may look good," I admitted.</p> <p>"Come on, then, don't you want to stay and cuddle for a while longer?" she asked with a smile. "I promise we'll go to bed together next time. I promise that," she added.</p> <p>"Well, I have a feeling that maybe that is something we won't forget for the next time," I said.</p> <p>"I'd love that," she grinned.</p> <p>***</p> <p>We woke up early the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to go at dinner. "I have a surprise for you before you go home early this morning," she said smiling and hugging me. "I am wearing some of Mom's things," she added with a giggle.</p> <p>"What's that?" I asked, suddenly remembering, "Of course I'm going to wear Mom's things."</p> <p>"And I'm wearing something like hers," she said grinning. "And I've got to go get ready for work," she added, kissing me lightly on the lips.</p> <p>"That sounds like fun. I can't wait," I said, hugging her tight again.</p> <p>We finished breakfast, then showered, dressed and met at the door to the dining room. I hugged Sarah goodbye, but let her know I was on my way.</p> <p>"So how are Mom and Dad doing?" I asked.</p> <p>"They're happy," she said, looking at me with a smile. "It's pretty easy to be here this morning."</p> <p>"That's great." I said. "The surprise is good and hopefully we'll be back together soon. Now we need to get ready and get going."</p> <p>After breakfast, we sat around talking while we ate breakfast. There was plenty of chatter and laughing, as we were all pretty good at eating. When we were done, I went to my room to get ready for Mom and Dad's wedding. I was going to wear a very nice silk dress that showed a little cleavage but when I pulled up in front the mirror, I noticed I had an extra pair of breasts.</p> <p>When I reached their church, I found they were having a small reception reception too, about 15 minutes after my arrival. I looked at several faces to see that I already had a couple of dozen of them in a line at my door. I looked back at the church and saw the pastor, Mr. Wilt Larson, who was grinning, as I entered. He asked me to sign up a few of the young women to come around and talk with him the entire time. I asked for another woman and he agreed.</p> <p>Soon everyone was there, except for Mr. Wilt Larson, and he turned to Mr. Larson and said, "I know you're married now."</p> <p>"Mr. Larson just wants to thank all of you for coming," he said. "Now let's move to the church to talk, shall we?"</p> <p>I gave him my heart and said, "Sure."</p> <p>The pastor had several small tables available to sit at, so we sat at the first, and then we sat in the second.</p> <p>Mr. Larson and Mr. Larson began talking about the wedding and how happy they were to be getting along. Soon Mr. Larson's table was filled and we were having a lively breakfast of eggs, bacon and tomatoes. The pastor began, then said we must go home and prepare a reception that had some music on to listen to. I got a couple of beers from the bar and made a pitcher of sangria, and, once it was finished, I sang along with it. We sat about talking for about an hour before Mr. Larson said good morning.</p> <p>As we walked out of school we noticed that Mr. Larson seemed to be looking directly at the front of Mrs. Wilt Larson, so I gave him a smile and walked Mrs. Wilt Larson to the door.
