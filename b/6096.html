The scent of Jasmine filled the small space. "I'm never going to forget that first time—being held down by a strong, handsome man..."</p> <p>His kiss became stronger. "I love you," he whispered again and again. His heart was beating faster, not in fear of losing control like those men had in the car, but in excitement as his cock stiffened against her body, harder still.</p> <p>"I love..." she thought. "I want to have you."</p> <p>"I would take you now." His lips moved, teasing her bottom lip, and she kissed him back. Their kisses grew more urgent, her tongue pressed against her lips. They broke and she looked at him. He seemed to be reading her mind.</p> <p>"When you're ready, I want you on top."</p> <p>Her face was flushed and her heart was racing. He was right—her pussy would do anything to feel his cock, to get wet with his cum—but right now all she wanted was to feel it. Her heart was pounding, her knees weak, and her thighs quivered as she lifted herself onto her knees.</p> <p>Before she knew it, his hands had started undoing the buttons of her shirt and his breath was coming in heavy gasps. She had never been shirtless before, not even my husband, and now she was—not only in her panties, but in a black bra.</p> <p>"I love your body," he murmured, running his hands through her dark chestnut hair.</p> <p>"I can tell."</p> <p>He cupped her breast, cupped her bra-covered breast and gave it a gentle squeeze. Then he slipped a nipple between his thumb and index finger. The sensation was enough to send thrills through her abdomen that went straight for her pussy and caused it to tingle even further.</p> <p>"God, you're so damn sexy," he said, his breath heavy.</p> <p>Her heart was beating harder for him and the moisture between her legs began to seep through her panties.</p> <p>"You want me?" he asked, as he looked down at her. "You want me in my mouth?"</p> <p>"Yes," she breathed back.</p> <p>He took his right index finger and lubed the tip. She moaned as she felt him press his hand against her belly. Then he moved his body so it would enter her and press in as he moved his finger up and down, pushing all of her wetness out. As her back arched in the process and then her legs began to quiver from the intensity, she couldn't keep her back from arching more and more.</p> <p>He looked directly into her eyes. "Are you ready?" he asked as he moved his face away from hers and looked down at her. Their eyes locked, but their smiles were so much more focused. She felt like she was in a trance because she opened her eyes just a bit to meet his, but when she looked down her gaze fell on his cock which stood so proudly straight up from his body.</p> <p>"Oh, baby," she moaned dreamily at his touch.</p> <p>He reached behind him and undid the clasp of her bra which came undone quickly and fell to the floor, followed by her shirt. His eyes continued down her body as he took her panties and bra off and tossed them in one hand.</p> <p>He looked at her. "Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes," she managed to say.</p> <p>He moved her legs apart. "I can't wait any longer." The expression on his face had changed. It was no longer amused, or amused at all—no more a mask of power. A sexy, sexual animal was coming through to him at that moment. A cock that was as hard and thick and strong as anything she'd ever seen and a hard, demanding, intimidating—and powerful.</p> <p>She looked down as she took her panties off. His cock rose into the air. Her pussy was wet—really wet—and it was waiting for him to enter. The heat of his body caused it to expand—to envelop his cock. She couldn't get her legs apart—there was barely any space between her legs. If he moved his legs, she'd be able to wrap them around his neck.</p> <p>"Ready to enter me?" he whispered. "Beg for it?" His hands went to her hips and he looked down at her, her eyes still looking at him.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered. "Please, baby," she added.</p> <p>Her eyes widened and she looked back at him. "Please, I need to feel you," she managed to say. "Please, fuck me now."</p> <p>He walked over to the dresser, still stroking—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
