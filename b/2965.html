She looked up from the newspaper then at her husband. He was leaning against the door frame watching her. The thought of what he had seen made her smile in spite of the fact that she was still naked. She looked at the front door. Her husband had his gun out and was looking at her.</p> <p>She looked back at him as she opened the door. "How long is you going to keep me baby?" She said in a sultry, sexy voice.</p> <p>"Long as you like," he said. He reached out and grabbed her around the waist and held her with one arm while slowly kissing her. As he kissed her her hips lifted and her lips open and they kissed each other.</p> <p>Their tongues slid across each other tasting their sweat and pussy in his mouth. Their mouths pressed tighter together. She felt his cock rising as it pressed into her thigh. She reached down and opened her legs and held him hard as they kissed. She wanted more.</p> <p>"You want to fuck me, right now?" she asked as a matter of fact.</p> <p>"God yes," was all he could say. He put his arms around her and pulled her against him. Their lips locked together as he caressed her breasts and began kissing her neck running his tongue along her sensitive skin. He leaned in and whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"You have to ask for it my pet. I will show you and if you don't take it you will regret it."</p> <p>He lowered his head and softly kissed her nipples. She shivered as he kissed his way across them. He kissed her lips tenderly until her lips parted and she opened herself to him. His tongue slid into her mouth like hers. Her moans spurred him on. His hand slipped down to her navel.</p> <p>Pushing his finger into the soft brown fur that surrounded her he looked up at her. He lowered his head and kissed an inch above her navel until he reached her lower belly. As his lips approached her navel he looked at her and lowered his head and kissed her pubic hair. It smelled of pure excitement with just the faintest hint of musk.</p> <p>At the mere touch of his lips there he stopped and looked up at her before continuing. "Baby you are gorgeous. I don't see how that can be wrong?" he said with a broad grin. He kissed her stomach as his fingers traveled to the bottom of her pussy lips and pushed lightly against them. She shivered as he did.</p> <p>He pushed harder against the lips, feeling them yield and open. Again his head moved and he kissed the outer lips. He continued to kiss them until he knew she was fully in his mouth. His tongue swirled around her lips and she moaned loudly as her head lifted and her legs wrapped around his waist as he held her firmly in place with his free arm.</p> <p>"Oh God oh baby," she screamed as his tongue worked to gain access. He pushed his tongue into her lips and worked up her throat. He knew her orgasm would begin, just as he wanted it to. Her legs tightened around his waist and he felt her grip him more fiercely as he began to suck on her erect nipple.</p> <p>"Yes baby yes," she moaned as his nose tickled her as her legs pressed up against his lower back. With one hand he reached down and lifted her up off the chair as his other hand began to rub her clitoris.</p> <p>Her eyes widened in surprise as he began to suck and lick her nipples. Again she felt the wave lift and her legs opened wider. "God yes," she gasped as her orgasm began to rock her pelvis. Her nails dug into the leather as her orgasm ripped through her. Her back arched as she screamed aloud, "Oh baby it feels so good. Baby you are making me cum. Make me cum."</p> <p>He lifted her off the chair and lowered her toward the floor again. Reaching down he removed his mouth from her nipple and kissed her. She ran her nails along his back and he reached between them and took hold of her hips.</p> <p>Her legs were still open and her hands came to his hair as her hips pushed upward against his waiting mouth. Slowly she started to move up his body. When she got to his belly he raised his hips and she lowered back down until she met his hardon.</p> <p>His eyes never left hers as he kissed her. It was a gentle kiss. His lips touched hers. They both sighed as he slid his hands under her as she wrapped her legs around his waist. His cock felt like velvet as he slowly pressed it against her mound.</p> <p>Her mouth opened and she kissed him as she raised her hips. She felt a wave lift from her abdomen and she gasped as she began to hump his cock. He pulled her closer until she could feel his cock begin to throb in herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
