I saw a beautiful young girl, a beautiful smile, and a great body. As one of our co-workers, she had worked on my last project in the company. We got along very well and were always close friends. She had been a little bit of a tease until I got to know her. During the week (on my birthday, next Thursday) I had gone out of my way to introduce her to different people. It had been over a year since I had last seen her. She was a good worker, I had been a real friend for awhile now, she was really nice to talk to, she even flirted with me.</p> <p>I guess she was also a flirt and I would flirt back.</p> <p>One nice thing about a good relationship is a good relationship is good chemistry. Not a huge amount of chemistry, but you can still come outta the clouds with that chemistry...I think that I know what you are feeling right now.</p> <p>I knew this girl had a good eye for me and, if I put a name and a phone number, maybe we could hit it off right away.</p> <p>After work, I headed back to the office. I figured my luck could improve and I figured I might get lucky. I was about to leave when I heard a female voice. I turned around to see her looking as beautiful as ever. She was maybe in her early 30's, short-cropped blonde hair. She wore a red corset, white knee socks, knee-high boots, and nothing else.</p> <p>She smiled up at me and stood up. I smiled back. We went over to each other. She leaned in and kissed me. I kissed her back. Our arms were around each other as we kissed. She pushed me to the floor. She climbed up onto my lap and we started to make out like crazy. Our hands were both roaming each other; each one of us was exploring. Her hand found my cock and grabbed it. With a jerk, both hands were on it. Her right hand found my balls and slowly started pumping them. I spread my legs a little more so she had room to work. It felt amazing. We kept kissing and I reached behind her; I grabbed a hold of hers and helped her up. She took the lead, and we were on our way to the bedroom. She pushed me back on the bed and straddled my cock with her legs. I was as hard as a rock. I laid back and she started to grind her pussy lips around my cock. It felt incredible. She continued to rub herself up and down and I could tell she was trying to make it cum. It looked like she was trying to make this happen. She slowed down and started to rub around the tip and the head of my cock then back to my cock head, all over again. She kept on trying to push more and more into her pussy. When it was all the way in she lifted off, I took that as a cue to pull out a little bit from under. She did this over and over until my cock was almost entirely out of her.</p> <p>She leaned back down and took me back inside of her. She was moaning louder and louder as I started to piston back in and out of her. Her pussy was so wet it was like running a warm bath to help lubricate the motion. She started to bounce back and forth on me with each down stroke. She got faster and was now slapping her thighs against my legs. The slapping sound became loud. It was almost like someone were beating an ice cube across my cock.</p> <p>The slapping continued and the louder she got louder, then louder, then louder and louder. The slapping intensified. I was in a sexual trance that I knew it would go away.</p> <p>She was moaning louder and louder, then louder, then louder. Then suddenly stopped herself and got dressed again. We kissed again. I then got up and took a shower. Then took a quick shower myself. She left the bathroom for a minute. I took a quick shower, grabbed a towel, and went to the bathroom. I was startled when suddenly, I heard moaning...I turned around to find a young brunette. I didn't recognize her but it was like she had stepped from a movie. I saw she had just as naked as I was. She had long legs and a perfect body. Her large tits were hanging down like a shelf in a shelf. Her pussy was neatly trimmed and looked even better when I thought of them. Her pussy lips were hanging open; they were very inviting. I was about to reach into the shower when she stopped me, kissed me once more and smiled.</p> <p>"I can't thank you enough for helping out today." She said.</p> <p>I looked at her in astonishment. I smiled back. She then turned around and gave a little back to me.
