You know what I mean.</p> <p>I'd like to.</p> <p>But don't you dare go anywhere else.</p> <p>Now that I have my clothes off, and your shirt off, and your pants and underwear and socks and shoes on, I want to suck on your dick.</p> <p>Let's see how much time we can spend together.</p> <p>Your dick. I want to feel her soft lips all around it.</p> <p>She is so good at sucking a nice, fat dick.</p> <p>I want to kiss it and feel it swell up on my tongue, and see it swell up inside her soft lips.</p> <p>Let's see how long we can stay together.</p> <p>Let's see if you can stay here with me, like I'm with you, in your bed.</p> <p>You can stay there all day. When this is done, I think I would make love with you every day if that's what it took. You won't be bored, will you?</p> <p>The next day? I don't think so.</p> <p>I hope not! We don't have much time.</p> <p>If we do, we'll need it.</p> <p>Let's stay together for as long as we can. When we come, there will be no turning back, no end in sight. I want you to be my lover and mine.</p> <p>Let's just have a little more time together at the end, like we've been.</p> <p>You know I'd like that.</p> <p>I sure do. I'll see you tomorrow.</p> <p>Call me soon, okay?</p> <p>Call me. She won't be around so long.</p> <p>She isn't, will she? I just hope. You two won't be alone forever.</p> <p>I wish I was your lover, like they were, before we got married.</p> <p>Let's start again with a little more time.</p> <p>She can't talk yet. She's going through this.</p> <p>Maybe later, she'll talk.</p> <p>The next day was a beautiful sunny day, and there was still another couple of weeks before the wedding. I didn't want to leave her alone so much.</p> <p>"Hey, I wanted to take a trip. Would you like to join me tomorrow here? We could have a quick pool party."</p> <p>"I like that idea, but if we decide to go together, we'll need to take a day to think about it. I don't know about you, but I really need to think about our future. This is all too much.</p> <p>"It would be nice to stay in bed with you this time.</p> <p>"Can you stay with me tomorrow? Will you come with me? I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.</p> <p>"I wish there were that big tub next to my room.</p> <p>"Is there anything you would like to do on the island that will keep me out the sun like me?"</p> <p>I'd like to take you to dinner on the island.</p> <p>"I want to see all of your place. I want to see how your house looks, what your pool looks like. What about the pool? I want to see you in the water.</p> <p>"I've never known anyone like me. Maybe I'll be seeing you at the end.</p> <p>"Maybe I'll be seeing you in the other room.</p> <p>You really are beautiful.</p> <p>"I see that. I still have some room to show it.</p> <p>"I'd love to go swimming next to you on that nice white sand with me.</p> <p>"I don't know, maybe something along those lines, if you would.</p> <p>"I guess you'll just have to put up with my bad luck.</p> <p>"What happened, did you like my house? I hope it didn't bother you in the kitchen?</p> <p>"No one complained about it.</p> <p>"I wish you'd told me. She is a real sweet, polite woman. I could never let her see the house.</p> <p>"You didn't have to do anything. We can try anything. But I must admit, that if you weren't here to get me to bed, we wouldn't be together.</p> <p>"Just let me do it. If you're sure you really would, I'd like to see how your house looks. I love the house. I love seeing it all.</p> <p>"If you'll come back tomorrow, we can use it together.</p> <p>"I'd like that some more then."</p> <p>"No, you stay and talk to her. You'll know. I think I should bring her back to my room.</p> <p>"I'll go and get ready for her, and I hope you're ready for me inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
