As I was stepping out to my car, I saw that I have the number book from when I was at work, and we both had one each. As I turned to go into the house to retrieve my car, I realized that no one on the other side of the street saw me.</p> <p>I turned to say something, but saw that I could see no one around, but I guess I did hear my voice. He walked over to me with the same big smile on his lips that he used on his first customer, "That was fun and I hope you have another chance to do it again." And then he leaned in and kissed my lips.</p> <p>"I have a couple of more clients in this week, so I think we need to do that some more, and for you, that's how good it would be to get together again." I said as we broke the kiss. Then I gave him a little kiss of gratitude and added "I am so looking forward to getting together again, and we may be planning a couple of your clients tonight!"</p> <p>He replied as we came in the door</p> <p>"Are you sure? I have a feeling there's a lot more on your mind than that."</p> <p>"Not a lot, since it looks like you did a lot more checking online than I did at work. You're the first one out that I have actually done so far, and if you want I can do the same to you, it would be awesome." And with that we both went down to the den, where I had my laptop in place and was looking through a few of the sites I had downloaded from other sites so I was always able to catch things on them, including some I hadn't ever checked up on.</p> <p>When I was looking at a site called "Cathy's" I saw a picture of a beautiful couple in bed together with the caption that said, "I would NEVER cheat, if I were your husband!"</p> <p>I went back up one page to what looked like an ad clip from Cathy and her husband, and the ad was one of "Dance with me, while we watch the music". On the title the ad showed how the couple in the photo had their arms around each other, and the name cathy was standing behind with the caption, "The two of them love the same music."</p> <p>In the ad it stated that as Cathy and her friend were the ones who were dancing, it was best for them to join the couple, and since the couple had a private room reserved for them to put on a show for the people present, and that the couple enjoyed it as well. This ad also indicated that if the couple were invited to be the couple, the ad would be open between Cathy's and her husband's company, or she could bring the couple and dance with each other for their private show. I was shocked but could not look away from the ad at the same time because Cathy had said that she would be happy to do so with them.</p> <p>"I am sorry to be lying to you, but I didn't want to tell you how special that would be for me. When I saw the ad and looked at you, I realized how special it would be, and I am not happy with what we had together, so I have changed my mind about going out to dinner tonight, but if it goes well with our arrangement that I would love to see you again."</p> <p>In a matter of seconds I heard the screen go dark and felt the sound of a zipper.</p> <p>When I looked back at the pictures on the computer I saw that there was a number a very familiar hand was on my arm, and a long wet, bare, hot, tongue was running around my lips, trying its best to get me out of the trance we had built in ourselves, and all over our body. We both opened our eyes and smiled at each other, and gave each other a big kiss.</p> <p>When we broke the kiss, I could see him looking at me and said, "It's good to see you again! I know that it is, but I really missed you, and you look so much better in person, and I miss that. If you would rather have someone go away or come back, go ahead and have dinner with them. You look much better than you did when I was there to take care of you."</p> <p>"No, it's OK, I'm glad you like me. The last few days have been awesome, and I love being with you and the rest of the company."</p> <p>"I know, and I loved what you did for me, but now it's time to make good on your promise of sharing my bed with someone you know about tonight as wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
