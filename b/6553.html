She felt like a schoolgirl as he gently entered her and she let out a loud moan at the same time. He started thrusting into her slowly and she responded by meeting him, and he started fucking her faster. She came almost violently but was amazed at the feelings of pleasure. He had pulled out and his cock was wet and she looked up at him, her mouth still a bit weak.</p> <p>"I'm going to do something else..." He said still stroking her back gently, "and it means it's time for bed. And this time, your turn."</p> <p>He put his clothes on and got her into his bed, which also turned pretty bad. He moved over her and started gently, kissing her all over.</p> <p>"Oohhh... you're too big." She smiled back at him, "I guess I'll have to take care of that."</p> <p>He pulled his shirt off and she looked at his muscular body, "Let me take care of just that..." She kissed him and he started kissing her neck too.</p> <p>"No, no!" She said after a while "Don't you need something?"</p> <p>"Nothing..." He kissed her again and she moved her lips to his ear.</p> <p>"No, I'm not a virgin anymore... if I want you... I'll give it to you..." She smiled at him and felt a little embarrassed.</p> <p>He looked at her and gave her the smile, "No worries, sweetheart."</p> <p>She was very glad that it came in his mouth and she looked at him and giggled, "You know... we're not going to do this if you can't take care of some other women, not anymore."</p> <p>He smiled at her and moved his hand to her thigh and she looked up to him, "Just wait a minute..." She moved down to suck on his cock and when he felt it start to get hard she got some more and started to take his load for her mouth and swallow. Then that was enough and he started to moan really hard and her eyes got misty.</p> <p>"It's okay." She smiled, "Don't worry, I had sex before." "So how was it..." She kissed him, tasting herself. "How did you... you got... that big..." She laughed softly.</p> <p>"It... was the best thing, I think..." He looked at her and was trying to catch his breath, "But do you want me to..."</p> <p>"Yes." She said smiling.</p> <p>"If you're sure."</p> <p>"Let's go before I get sick." She got out of bed and walked up behind him to kiss him on his neck. "I love you... you're the best thing ever..." Her eyes were still glowing and she felt so happy for him. She was going to ask him many things and she was going to do the one thing that she knew he loved to do. She got down on her knees and kissed him, "I love you"</p> <p>...</p> <p>He didn't think, but he did. He pulled her onto his lap and she put her head on his shoulder, and his cock was still hard. She smiled shyly and reached her hand between her legs and started to stroke him.</p> <p>"Can you go again?" He asked, not at all sure how much he loved her.</p> <p>"Why not". She said while sliding up his body. "I'm ready" She spread her legs for him and lifted her ass to his cock. She let out a soft moan and looked up at him and she was ready for the night, but he made his own decision then and he entered her. She screamed as he entered her and she hugged his arms as they started to move and he started to fuck her quickly.</p> <p>"Oohhh... Oohh.." She moaned as he kept fucking her and she started to play with her clit furiously and she started getting aroused again. His cock was so good and his hands held tight to her body while he continued to fuck her. All of a sudden though, there was a scream from behind. He couldn't make out but his fingers felt her body react and this made him really aroused. She looked up to him and giggled as she moved her body a little more.</p> <p>"Are you... getting... excited?" She whispered in his ear.</p> <p>"What do you think?" He smiled, "Yes." He kept his cock going into her as the pleasure from it increased. She leaned her head back and closed her eyes as she felt another moan from behind her. The sight that he was seeing was so erotic, especially her wet body that was moving with him. She felt even more of the intensity and moans came from behind her. She started to moan hard and he put his hand on it.
