It seemed an eternity before he finally reached around and unzipped her pants. They dropped to the floor at their feet in a heap. As he lay on top of her, her skirt rose up and wrapped itself around his waist. Her panties were still on the floor and he began sucking on her lips.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around him and rolled her hips. He began sliding his cock back and forth across her wet pussy while she stroked his face hair. She could feel the warmth of his breath as she rubbed her hips on him.</p> <p>He was moving his hips faster, grinding himself into her pussy. She began squirming and moaning as she climaxed and started grinding on him again. He rolled on top of her and began moving back and forth, letting her get used to him. She held him, trying to pull him in closer to her so she could feel his hardness against her.</p> <p>He was moving deeper and harder. His dick was sliding in and out of her pussy. He was kissing her neck. Soon, her hips were bucking and his dick was throbbing against her. She screamed as her orgasm hit. She felt weak, but he was still fucking her, driving himself in and out. She could feel him go a little limp.</p> <p>It was when she finished, he slowly pulled his still half-hard dick out of her. She was weak and weak. Her body was shaking from the exertion, but she managed to lift herself from the bed and stand up on tiptoes.</p> <p>He lay down next to her and kissed her neck. She turned and laid him on his back. Then she mounted him. She rode up and down on his dick. His hands were massaging her breasts. His mouth hungrily devoured her nipples. She rocked her hips faster while she looked into his eyes. She knew he was getting close, so she put her hands on his chest, giving him a better angle to thrust inside her.</p> <p>He reached up and grabbed her ass, massaging it. His cock was still hard, even though he had fucked her pussy once already. She was going to ride him again. If he wanted to come again, she was sure to let him. He pulled her nipples and bit her tits.</p> <p>It turned her on so much that she was surprised he had even gone that far. She had gotten used to that kind of thing, but she had had it before with some women. He had felt different when he kissed her lips and tongue as she rode his cock. She loved the attention his mouth had given her, and the way he seemed to love her nipples, and how he just bit them.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus, Matt." She panted, "That's going to make me come again." She lifted herself up off his dick and then lowered herself again. He reached up and grabbed her ass and lifted it higher. One of his hands returned to massaging her tits as she moved up and down his dick.</p> <p>"I want you," she told him, "I want you to come inside me." She felt the cum churning in her insides as she rode him. It was as if she wasn't in control. Maybe she wanted it to be just for him. He still hadn't come, but she knew he was not going to last too much longer. She just wanted him to come inside her.</p> <p>He reached up and grabbed her ass, holding her in close. She could feel his dick pulsing against her, pushing against her insides. Then she felt it swell up and erupt into her. She leaned down and pressed her breasts together, feeling the heat of his semen inside her. He squeezed himself between them and leaned back. They both shivered a little, their bodies shaking each time he came.</p> <p>They rolled over. She fell on top of him. Their bodies tingled with emotion, but it had been a long week. She kissed him, pressing their tongues together.</p> <p>"You're going to have to be a few more weeks," he murmured. "I'll only move if you promise you never do that again."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she replied, "We'll just spend the next year together." She rolled onto her side, turned and kissed him. Their bodies began to melt togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
