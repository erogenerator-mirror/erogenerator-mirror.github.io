The fear was palpable and she stood there not moving despite the fact that her jeans were clung to her body and I could see through the top of them and the dampness of her panties through them.</p> <p>"Look Beth, it's okay, really."</p> <p>The fear returned, though much like Beth had in the past she put a hand on my wrist, gently guiding me away. My stomach dropped as I realized what was expected of me - I was going to be raped.</p> <p>"But I haven't done anything," I said again.</p> <p>"We're past," Beth said. "We'll never do anything other than what we want. Do you understand?" Her hand stopped. "That's what we want. We want it. That's why we always have it. We don't want it, so we're going to give it to you," she said this, again without bothering with a word and without taking her hand away from me. "Do you understand?" she asked again.</p> <p>"Very much," I said.</p> <p>And I was. I felt a wetness between my legs, a strange ache through my pants and suddenly I felt incredibly aroused.</p> <p>Beth had stood to one side of her friend and looked me up and down. For some reason she kept her eyes locked on mine. For another time she stood there smiling, her eyes sparkling, her body swaying. A strange smile, I thought.</p> <p>Beth took my hands and led me to the bed.</p> <p>"Lay down, there," she said.</p> <p>I lay on the bed. Beth was standing over me. I could see the dark shadow of her belly above her jeans, clearly visible as hers hung slightly open. In the gloom, I could just make out just the swell of her breasts and the dark outline of her nipples, their nipples standing up from the tips of her breasts and hard against her sweater.</p> <p>Beth was looking down at me. She pulled her jeans to the side and gently spread her legs apart. She looked at me, as though she sensed that me, my body and my mind could have a shared experience.</p> <p>"You do know that you're on your way to be raped, don't you, Jane," she said.</p> <p>I paused a moment. "Yes. I've watched this film. I have," I told her. "The script, though, didn't show a little of the way. It was a scary film, so scary in it it scared you - but we've never watched it, have we, Janey?"</p> <p>She smiled. "Nope. Didn't say that we would. Never watched film, I swear. I mean, it's the best part - I knew that it was coming, but I didn't know that it would happen! This is different - it does sort of hurt when you're in it at the start. The thrill - to be in the film. It would make me lose control and I was terrified of that!"</p> <p>"Oh well. The problem is the scary part," I told her. "I'm really worried about what you'll do," I added.</p> <p>Beth put her hand to her mouth and looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"And we haven't even begun," she said matter-of-factly. "Janey, do you mind if I do it?"</p> <p>I looked at her. "Of course not," I said smiling. "That was your idea, wasn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes," she replied. "And you didn't have to, you know. He didn't even get his pants down."</p> <p>"Yes. I did and I enjoyed it."</p> <p>"You were good," Beth said. "And you will."</p> <p>"Yes, Beth," I said. "Thank you. And I know not to say it, but we have to do this."</p> <p>Beth lifted her sweater over her head and then her bra, which had fallen to the bed. She stood to one side of me and again I saw her breasts.</p> <p>"Oh, Janey," she said, running her hands over the full globes, pinching them between her fingers and lightly pulling at them, leaving trails of colour in the shadow that fell across her chest. "You are so beautiful. I've always loved your breasts" - "and this, you look so good - you look so good" - but I was thinking, too, - you look so good! You're so incredibly sexy, Jane! But you're mine and you were just the right size. I know that I'm not a big girl, but it feels different to have breasts like yours - they're still small, but they look full."</p> <p>"And it is the right size," I told her, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
