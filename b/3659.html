You felt so good nestled in my arms and felt so secure. I whispered to you, "Mate... we can not do it. We don't want to."</p> <p>"I know. It's just... I don't know what would be... exciting if we just did it. I can't." You looked at me and I felt as if you were in some kind of trance. You leaned toward me, then kissed my lips. Your body was so close, closer. Your breast rubbed mine through your blouse. Your pussy lips were so wet. You turned back to looking me in the eye. I saw the hunger in your eyes and knew that you wanted me. Your pussy was still very, very close to my face. I kissed your lips again, then lowered my head to yours. Our lips touched. Your tongue slid in and began to explore my mouth like a snake. I could taste your cum on your lips. I knew that you wanted me to do more.</p> <p>My hands caressed your body. Your nipples were puckered and erect. My lips and hand sought more of your warm flesh. It seemed to me just right. Your pussy was very swollen. You reached down to feel for and stroke my growing cock. We continued our kiss. I wanted to taste your sweetness. I wanted to feel the hot wetness of your pussy. When I sucked your tongue into my mouth you began to moan. We kissed longer. My hands found your breasts. My fingers found the nipple and squeezed and rolled it as one of my lips kissed your face. Your breasts were so firm, so full and so beautiful. The little circles in your hard aureoles were more like an eraser. I looked back at the passion on my face and saw a wild look that had a lust and promise in it. Your mouth was smiling at me, so sweet. You wanted me to kiss you so I could taste your flavor and be free of all inhibition.</p> <p>As I sucked on your tongue your hips began to thrust against my thighs. You felt a pressure building in your pussy. I moved my hand down to your ass and began to pull your skirt up. It was time. I wanted to fuck your pussy. I took your hand, and put it through the crack of your ass. You felt so hot. I rubbed a finger over your butt hole. I was sure that you might be apprehensive but didn't want you not to. I kissed you again. Your lips were hot and sweet. You tasted so good. Your tongue snaked into my mouth. We kissed for several more minutes. I pulled the blouse off and then you looked back down at my cock and gave me a coy smile. You were so beautiful. I could see your eyes as she looked back up at me. You took my member in your hand. I was still hard. You continued to play with my cock. You had your own ideas.</p> <p>You told me not yet to make love to you. I agreed. You had taken control again. I wanted you to give me that power, but I wanted you to make love to me instead. I took your hand and put it on my cock. Just as I had done before, I put your hand on my cock. Your eyes closed and you began to stroke me. I put your hand on my cock as I kissed you. You began to stroke the length of my cock, watching the swollen head. I could feel it thicken and become harder with your hand on it. I looked at your body, at your tits. I loved the curves of your body. My hands caressed your skin. I put my lips to your neck. I nipped your flesh with my teeth. The flesh tasted different now, not sweet like before. No, they were still, just like the ones last night. Your skin felt more sensitive. So close to my mouth. I kissed you again. My hand reached down to your pussy again. I ran my finger over your clit as you stroked my cock... it was hard enough to feel it. The head of my cock moved up and down against it. I put my hand on the soft skin of your thigh and then raised it above my thigh. You were still sitting down, so I took it in my hand and rubbed it up and down over your pussy lips. I pushed the head down. You spread your legs a little wider for me. I rubbed it all over your wetness until you could feel it. I moved it around to feel your lips. I placed the hard cock between them and began to caress your clit. That was better. I could feel little electric shocks from your clit up on my shaft. I rubbed it as I teased your entrance. I rubbed it some more as I rubbed your clit with my finger. You continued to stroke my cock and I put my body between your legs. You felt great, just as you had felt on theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
