Mmm. This is soooo good."</p> <p>I'm not saying I have never been excited about sex before. Or anything like that. But, a guy in particular that I was in no particular position to tell him off was making me so wet.</p> <p>I had one of my hands on his cock, and with the other on his shaft, I was stroking him. There was no way he was going to last. He leaned his head back and held onto my shoulders. He let go of my body on the bed, and I held onto his shoulders. He leaned back and pulled the covers off us, and we collapsed onto the bed.</p> <p>"Mmm. You are so beautiful, Jess. I can't believe what I just did."</p> <p>"Yeah, it's going to take a few minutes before I recover. You're a stud."</p> <p>"What do you mean, stud? Do I look like a stud?"</p> <p>"Of course. But, I need more sex. What do you think? Should we get some more of that lube before we start?"</p> <p>He was right, I thought. I've already lost the ability to say it, so I did. I spread my legs some and opened them to him; he knelt down in front of me and knelt down beside us.</p> <p>"Come here, Jess. I'm not taking any Viagra. You'll feel better in a minute."</p> <p>As soon as he put on one of the lubes and got a lube in his hand, he was back between my legs. He slowly pushed his cock into me. I was not sure I could stay still any longer, so I put my feet around him.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes please. Oh, that's so good."</p> <p>"Can I get on my hands and knees, Jess?"</p> <p>I knew what he wanted. I could tell how turned on I was by the hard way he was breathing.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He slowly pushed himself into me with one long deep thrust. I was so wet and so wet that I didn't know what to expect.</p> <p>"Mmm. You're so tight. Did you like that, little pussy?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said quietly. He reached down to my hips and slid his hand inside me. The motion felt so fucking good, so smooth! It took only a minute or two to be ready to cum.</p> <p>I looked back at Tom. He had a mischievous look on his face, but didn't know what to do or say.</p> <p>"Yes?" he said.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me this time. You're too big to start out slow and build up to something bigger and more energetic."</p> <p>I felt him pull it almost all the way out and then all the way back in one big movement, but not all the way out, really, just enough to make me want him to go faster. I moaned the word "yes" repeatedly as he did. He held on to that moment like a vise and fucked me furiously.</p> <p>"Mmm. Good! That's it, Jess - don't stop!"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes. Yes. Don't stop! Go faster. Faster, Jess!"</p> <p>"Yes. Faster! Go faster!" I cried, and he was so hard inside me and I was moaning, I couldn't think of how I was moaning and how I got this way over the edge.</p> <p>"Oh, that's so fucking good! Oh, Tom, I'm going to - I'm going - "</p> <p>"Yes. Yes. Oh! Yes! You feel so good. Come for me, Jess!"</p> <p>He thrust in and out of me so hard, it felt like he was pulling his cock out in two and sliding it back into me. I could feel every inch of it, and when he did that - as long as he kept it going - I had the sensation that it would all end there.</p> <p>"Yes - yes - give me all of it!"</p> <p>His hips were banging into my butt, and I knew he was coming and I felt it too, just as hard and fast.</p> <p>Tom's orgasm started as he was emptying his balls into my pussy. I could feel it, felt it deep in my vagina. And just before it subsided - when both our bodies were drained and the pulses were subsiding again - the two of us were on the edge of what was the most passionate, sexiest, and orgasmic love I can imagine a man can ever hope to have.</p> <p>We came back to earth in a few minutes. He lay next to me, and we just held each other, both panting and both satisfied.</p> <p>After a while he rolled off the bed. I thought he was going to get upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
