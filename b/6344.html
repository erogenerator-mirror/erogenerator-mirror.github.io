He laughed and told me that he would show me.</p> <p>"OK," I started. After a few minutes of talking, he handed me the soap. My hands automatically slipped under the water for a minute until my palms slid over my face and the water started. I started working over the soap, slowly moving down and touching my skin under the water. I thought about it for a few seconds, the feeling was erotic. A bit too quickly for me but it was exciting a bit more. After about half an hour, I was ready to get out.</p> <p>I washed my entire breast and under it was my left tit. I rubbed the soap all over the nipple without being particularly rough and the feeling of it harden and poke out was almost too much. I then took a couple of extra deep latherings and started to do my face. I started at my mouth and then stuck a couple of fingers into my mouth. Again, I was not particularly rough and I felt like it was a new sensation for me. The feelings were different now but I just pressed on the wall a little harder. It was good to hear him moan again.</p> <p>I finished the front of the shower and was ready to get out. I still had my towel and went to find him. He had a light jacket on over his jeans. I found him in the kitchen.</p> <p>"Do you want a quick glass of wine?" I offered, "They're in the refrigerator. I have a better idea."</p> <p>"Yes, please," he said and grabbed something from the fridge, "it's the best present I can think of."</p> <p>I went out to the living room where I could hear him humming something.</p> <p>When I got out of the house, I found him standing at the refrigerator with a glass of wine. He handed me one and told me to take off my towel, which I did with the towel at first and then I took off my robe. I didn't realize until that point that I had forgotten my panties and realized this because I kept taking them off the day before. He had already finished with his work and brought in a plate out and stood watching as I served him the wine and took it away to sit in a chair, which he set for me. He looked at me, smiled, and said, "I know this is hard for you but you are doing wonderfully and it is great to have someone like you around on a daily basis."</p> <p>I told him I was surprised how easily I accepted it and how much of it was my "little experiment," and to just enjoy it. Then I looked back up at him, his eyes were closed and he had a half smile on his lips."And yes, I believe I am doing wonderful," I told him as I walked over, my heart thumping a little against my ribcage.</p> <p>He asked me a lot of questions, about work, what I did at the club, who I was dancing with, anything that I could think of. All the while we were talking, talking and laughing. He told me he knew I was married and had an ex-wife, but also knew I was only interested in a couple of drinks, "so I did all these things to make the evening more special" he said. He took my hand and helped me in to the living room, as he took a chair at the head of the couch near his feet. Then we sat on the couch and I told him I loved the evening and to just accept it.</p> <p>We talked with him for a while. Then we just hung on each other. His right hand was resting on my right thigh while his left was on my left shoulder. It had to have felt good. I could feel it moving around in my body. I tried to keep it between us but it was hard as we sat in his living room.</p> <p>While we talked, his right hand was slowly creeping closer to my left shoulder and on to my shirt. When he stroked me and then started to lower his hand, I thought I'd done something right. All the time that was going on, his right hand never left my shoulder. I was surprised, and not in the least. If he expected me to stop it then he was very surprised to find his touch had made me very aroused. There was a spark in his eyes and his hand seemed to become ever more bolder. I could not stop myself from leaning my head backward a bit and he put his lips near my ear, whispering all kinds of things.</p> <p>He kept talking but he was now holding my right breast under the water. He leaned over and took my nipple between his thumb and finger and started to roll it. Then he just kind of stopped and leaned back a bit. I was surprised at his boldness but also very attracted to seeing him do this. His hand now started roaming up and down my left thighâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
