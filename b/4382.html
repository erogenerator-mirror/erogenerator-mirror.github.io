She thought of him every time they had gone and laughed when they returned. They never seemed to tire of each other, they never seemed to have any intention of taking things to the next level. She wondered if that was the best thing that could happen to any woman. She wondered if she would ever find that man who never seemed to be as insatiable. Yes, she was a woman and she wanted to be with a man who respected her. So she decided that maybe if a man made her feel that way that there was no going back. If she gave him the chance to explore her mind a little with his hand. It was a simple plan but for her the best thing to do after that would be to find a man who didn't want to be alone.</p> <p>She went home and called her husband on the way home from her first assignment. She knew it wouldn't be long and she would find him.</p> <p>She had dinner and watched some television while reading the local sports channel. As she lay in bed she felt a light knock at the door. She lifted the covers as she heard her husbands voice.</p> <p>"Maggie"</p> <p>She looked up at him.</p> <p>"Honey?"</p> <p>"I saw you at the gym before I got off work."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I could have gone home."</p> <p>He smiled at her.</p> <p>"It's okay, don't worry. I won't come off as possessive and possessive about you or anything like that."</p> <p>"I am just trying to be supportive," she said. "It's nice to have someone you love for a change. I don't feel bad about it."</p> <p>"Not at all," he said softly. "I don't think there will be any jealousy between us."</p> <p>He kissed her and she returned his kiss. He had already told her that she needed to have a lover of her own. He felt a twinge of excitement at the idea. She didn't seem the type to have any real commitment to sex. Maybe her only choice would be going to college or going to work. Maybe in college the idea of going to college while sharing a lifestyle with a stranger appealed to her sexually. Maybe not. Regardless, she felt she needed a change. A change that would end in her going back to the city to visit her parents and her husband. She had to get on her feet. For the next five years she would go to college, not to work, have a boyfriend, or even her husband.</p> <p>And she had not even found out why she had been so busy. For that matter she had not even gotten to make love with any one. If she had wanted to, she would have gone to college and found a man in her dreams. Now all she needed was a man that could make an impression.</p> <p>"Maggie, I'm going to sleep in. It's getting kind of late."</p> <p>"Okay, thanks. You go ahead and make yourself comfortable," she said as she settled in to her bed.</p> <p>She waited for him to come in and close the door behind him. She heard him walking towards the bathroom. She heard another knock and he entered the room. She knew her husband would never be the same after she left. He didn't want her to feel like she needed him to feel that same loss. For a moment, he stood staring at her. He seemed to know what she had been missing and what it was.</p> <p>"Maggie. I need to apologize. I didn't mean to be so abrupt. I'm sorry I didn't mean to embarrass you."</p> <p>He looked at her for a long moment.</p> <p>"It's fine. I understand. I don't want you getting hurt."</p> <p>"Oh, you don't?" she said, trying to hide her excitement at the possibility of being with him again.</p> <p>"No. No. I'm not. Not now," he reassured her before turning away and walking to the kitchen.</p> <p>"I wish you could do this for me," she thought to herself. "Why wouldn't he? He has already made it very clear to you that he loves you, and wants to see you happy."</p> <p>She couldn't look at him as she sat down in her bed. She couldn't see him. She could hear everything he said. She looked at him and saw the sadness that was on his face. He turned around to see her staring at him. There was something in his eyes that made her heart ache. It was a soft emotion and she knew it was a need.</p> <p>"Maggie. I'm so sorry, I don't mean to cause such pain," he said. "I know you are hurt and I just needed to be able to make you feel better."</p> <p>She saw sadnessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
