He put the glass down on the table and grabbed the other bottle. Then he pulled her to him and held her close to his chest, their legs entwined. He leaned back against the headboard while his fingertips trailed down her neck.</p> <p>"If the girls would like to come over sometime," he said, "I'd like to stay tonight, or for a while. But that might be just as well, since it will be an evening of the best." He kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind if I take a drive this afternoon, since I have an early start tomorrow," she said. "You might call me on the phone if the need arises. You know I like to keep my little friends away from home, and there's something I'd like to do with you." She kissed him on the lips.</p> <p>"Well, maybe if you're in shape I'll join you." They kissed again, and it became a long, lingering taste of their previous kisses, something they had shared.</p> <p>"Let's get our car and go shopping," she told him. Then as she finished getting dressed she said, "I think I'll go to the movies now. If it's okay with you."</p> <p>"All I'm asking is that you get along with me, and that's what I'm asking for."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she smiled. "We'll see you tomorrow."</p> <p>They exchanged numbers and then they parted.</p> <p>Later that night, he lay on his back on the bed. The covers had come up, and there was a soft knock at the door. He reached for the covers, but was met by the soft lips of a woman. He thought for a second to reach over to kiss her, but remembered the consequences and said,</p> <p>"If you're going to come over tomorrow we may as well see if we're going to be as good friends again." He reached for her, but she turned back. "What are you doing?" he asked.</p> <p>"I have to go again to the movies," she said with a sexy smile, "but I can think of something nice," she added with a sexy smile and started to slide from the bed.</p> <p>"I'm going to the mall, and I'm buying some new things to wear," she told him. "Just wear something, okay?" The room door shut as they got back to bed, but she turned the lights out and started to take her panties off. She smiled when she saw him begin to get hard at the look in his eyes. She rolled off her panties and then got into bed facing him in a 69 position. When her lips met his, she kissed him fully, and then licked his balls. When she took a break to suck the head of his cock, he said,</p> <p>"Now that the thought of me getting to do whatever happens, what now?"</p> <p>"I'm going to give you a blowjob you'll never forget, so I'll let you cum in my mouth, and you can lick me after," she replied.</p> <p>"Really?" he asked. "How would that not be so bad, being my best friend."</p> <p>The next day, he called and made a reservation for his usual Friday night, as it might be a nice place to visit. Then his phone rang. His wife answered the phone and saw it was him. She gave him the quick version of the scenario she'd been hoping for for a while before letting him know she was coming over, and they agreed with the movie she wanted. He had to smile when he heard the rest of the conversation and realized he had a new favorite fantasy of hers.</p> <p>"Well, I guess we'll see what happens tonight, but just remember: I don't think I'll be able to get hard for a while." And as he hung up the phone he said,</p> <p>"You're too good for me."</p> <p>They had sex for the very first time, and during that time she made love to him in all three beds of the dorm. All he remembered as he woke was his hardon lying between the two beds. He didn't have to lie to say the first night that night. He felt his hand rubbing his dick. It felt good to feel her skin there. In fact, every morning when he had a chance to make some of that morning's pleasure last, he had done it to himself. It would only help his cock get hard if he knew she was really awake.</p> <p>She was always surprised by his morning hardness when he awoke. He couldn't remember when he had had sex before, probably it hadn't gone as well as it had in the past, and heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
