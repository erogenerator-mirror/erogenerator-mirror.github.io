I asked.</p> <p>"I guess your answer is simple. You'll want to run and win but be careful. Now come on, we better get back to running. Remember, we'll be back home after dinner."</p> <p>The boys left in their trucks while I packed up. My mind was going a mile a minute when Mike came looking for me at the house. When we were finally back to the house I went to the kitchen to put a bag in the dishwasher. When I returned in a short time the boys were waiting for me in the living room sitting a small table with a glass of wine. "You really have to be careful now that you're back. I think you're going to be a very happy young man."</p> <p>I was shocked. As much as I hated and feared Mike he was right. But also I feared that I might have a choice in the matter. "Yes, I do have to be careful. I can't have him fucking me every day so I need you to teach me something about running." I said.</p> <p>I think the first thing my mind came back to was to put the panties into a bag. The panties were soft and silky. They were different than the ones I usually wore. But just putting them in they felt good. I was shocked when Mike said, "That's more like it." There had to be something there that I hadn't thought of. He was right about being a very, very, young man. Mike asked, "I told you we had to go over this a number of times with the guys because you are not used to being around men's' cocks." But the way he called it, cocks. "They're cocks, you're not used to it anymore. You are just learning that." He went on. The last thing I remember saying before I fell asleep was, "Thank you, please teach me everything."</p> <p>The next day I got up early and took the morning run to be with Mike. He was so excited I didn't even realize I had just fallen asleep. At some point I fell asleep again, but that was it for this time I dreamed, or else just dream. At several minutes after the first call out I became aware of how full of memories I was. I had no idea who I was, or where I was. I was a dream, nothing more and nothing less and far more beautiful than the events that happened during these past seven days with Mike. When they woke I thought I had lost track of time. But it was as if I had been there a time and hour.</p> <p>When I heard the alarm go off I was shocked. I thought the dream was over and the boys coming to do their job. But it didn't stop there, as Mike told me later. The only thing that kept coming was the fact that all I could think was, "I wish. I wish Mike could do this." The thoughts were so vivid I couldn't believe I was actually thinking aloud. I was beginning to believe I was in love with Mike. It felt so real, so real, that if it was real I wouldn't even remember my dream or Mike's cock. It was no dream, it was a hard, true dream that had happened to me on a lonely and empty nights, during the day just like this dream.</p> <p>The last thing that I remember before I drifted off to sleep was Mike's fingers slowly running over my pussy, pushing the crotch of the panties out. "Are you still so wet Mike?" Mike asked. "This is my first time."</p> <p>"Yes, I want you to enjoy every second of your first time," Mike said. A moment later my panties were soaked with juices. I don't know if I was dreaming because it felt real or if I felt a little guilt of being with Mike. If anything the fact that I had dreamed of him just felt good, just different, different, different.</p> <p>As I rolled over to turn on my side I realized that Mike had removed his shirt, and was also slowly but deliberately stroking his cock. "I have to go, Mike. There's plenty more where that came from." Mike stood by and we both watched as he stood there looking down at my exposed pussy. I don't know if it's what was going to happen more from the fact we had both known what was about to happen, or if I had been dreaming I had just gotten out of bed. Whatever the difference I didn't care, I wanted more.</p> <p>As Mike left the bathroom I started up the stairs. As I descended I heard voices coming down the kitchen. I wondered if they were the same neighbors as I was. The voices became louder and I suspected they were more than just my neighbors. Maybe just my neighbor's daughter as well as my mother.
