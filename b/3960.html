"I haven't been able to wait, so it's ok, don't ruin your makeup," he told me and I shuddered. "It would be a shame if I couldn't go back and take advantage of such a beautiful, sexy woman like you after every time you walk down the street, every time you say hello to another car when you see a crowd at the party..." He was talking about my lips and all the way down to my toes.</p> <p>The last part of the story was so unbelievable that I could barely believe my ears. "That sounds really... I know you probably like women like my legs, legs of all the races... so do you like having a woman like me all night long," I managed to say between gasps. "And I'm your lover, so how about having this pussy of mine tonight?" I managed to moan out something I didn't really understand.</p> <p>He was in a trance, so I leaned forward and slowly rubbed his cock a few times. I could tell that it was growing in his pants, and knowing that we'd done it this time it didn't hurt my chances.</p> <p>"Come on, let's go to the bar!" I told him. "I don't think he can resist me. He'd probably flip over if he knew if he could get his dick out. Oh fuck" He groaned.</p> <p>But I thought he was about to leave before I had a chance to respond, so we got up and left, but not before I took my top off so I could get mine on again. As we left the bar, I tried to stay out of the way, but I knew that he'd feel that when I was wearing a skirt and he knew what I was wearing underneath. And when I was walking, he'd notice I was wearing a thong. So he knew that I was wearing thongs. I felt my nipples grow hard under my top and as if in a dream I couldn't tell whether I was enjoying it or if I was just enjoying the attention.</p> <p>There was a bar with a couple of bar stools that was already open. I knew from talking to the other people already that the bartender wanted to make us something to drink. But it appeared he was in a hurry too, so we ordered our drinks and waited.</p> <p>After two or so rounds I was just finishing off my second Cosmo and when the bartender went to start the lights down he stopped. "Is there a table that can wait for us," he asked me as he poured our drinks. As I walked toward the table, I thought I saw a flash of jealousy on his face... I did have my pussy on display. I didn't know it though, but he seemed to like where it was leading.</p> <p>When I got there it looked like a fancy French restaurant with a great steak and baked potatoes, but they weren't bad... and I loved my thong on me.</p> <p>He was already seated when I sat down, taking the seat beside him on the other side. So we sat there as we sipped our drinks and I thought about how the evening had changed since we were in our 20's, how he was the first. And what made the night even more exciting and sexy. I just knew that this man could easily be my new lover and would have to be my "best friend". And then I remembered who I was sitting with. So I looked the person up and saw that her name is Amy.</p> <p>"You're in an incredible place tonight, Amy," he said. "You've known me for a long time. I had to see you!" He laughed, as if we were old friends. "It's so hard to stand on your own two feet. This is so crazy. He's so crazy, you know," he said as he smiled and took a sip from his drink. "Maybe we can take a walk on the way."</p> <p>"I don't need a walk. I'll need a glass. I haven't been with a man in a while, it's been really good." I wasn't going to push him any more, but as I said in my mind, it was time to take this step.</p> <p>"What's so special about you?" he asked. And as he said the word, I knew what it meant. "Do you want to get home and talk?" I asked.</p> <p>"Actually, yes," he told me, "I am staying the night. Why don't you join me for a drink?"</p> <p>I hesitated, but we hadn't gone far enough when he took a sip of his drink. I went with him and followed him out to our car, and for the first time tonight I saw a bit of a bulgeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
