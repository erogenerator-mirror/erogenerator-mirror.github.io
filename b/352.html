But she loved his big, strong frame, she could see that. Even in the small, dark basement of their house she admired his strong arms. She hated when she couldn't reach to touch them. The thought made her tremble.</p> <p>He had been teasing her, knowing she would always be unable to touch. He kept talking, reminding her just how hard her body was and how she would be sore for days if she couldn't touch herself. She realized, however, that she must be able to keep her hands out of things; she was his for the time being. She hated how it made her feel.</p> <p>"Now." He said quietly, "Get your robe off and come with me."</p> <p>Dana reluctantly obeyed, as she slipped the robe off and followed him into the shadows of their bedroom. She closed the door and he locked it. He took off his clothes as he stepped naked into the room, still completely naked.</p> <p>"Take the blindfold off; I want you to imagine what is about to happen. Now." He pushed the button that kept him blindfolded in front of her. As her lips brushed his chest and she heard him groan as she felt his body twitch. She took off her shirt as she heard him gasp and groan, and suddenly he was there, kissing and kissing her. His hands went between her legs and roughly stroked her. She could feel herself getting wet as his fingers entered her quickly. She shiver when he pushed a finger into her. She moaned, which made him groan as he pinched each nipple, which made her gasp.</p> <p>He quickly unbuttoned her shorts and quickly dropped them on the floor. Her legs spread open for him. He stood back and grabbed his cock, which was already hard. He slid the head of his cock between her lips, which made her moan and gasp. He slowly pushed into her, pushing and driving into her. Her juices were coating his cock. He felt the walls of her pussy gripping his cock. She could hear him moans, he made sounds that sent a thrill thru her.</p> <p>Dana felt his cock slide deep into her. He continued fucking her, slowly, and steadily. She felt her body quiver, which only added to the growing sensation. The whole day they had been together, in the dark, blindfolded, completely lost to her desire. He began to move faster, deeper, over and over.</p> <p>Dana felt herself come, her body suddenly racked with spasms. He continued to move himself in and out of her and his moans vibrate through her body. She felt him come too, but he was finished. He laid down on her back and kissed her, then they embraced, and she cried herself to sleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
