"I'm so happy to see you." He leans down even closer, as his warm, wet warmth spreads down my side and runs down my inner leg. He begins to lick around the edge of my ear lightly, and I feel his finger slowly tracing the line of my lips, teasing them just enough to tempt me further. When I don't fight his motion, he traces the shape of my lips once again, just enough so that the tip of his finger just barely brushes my clit. And my body quivers at just the thought of what he does to me.</p> <p>"I know you need to tell me, baby," he whispers. "But don't you dare let me come. I'm on the clock. You have a great body so far behind you." He runs his finger down my chest, circling my nipple and sending a shock through my body so hard that it makes me gasp. "But, not like this," he leans up, sucking his finger into his mouth and tasting the wetness he's just made. "This is what we got when we got here."</p> <p>"Oh yes," I moan. His finger slowly, deeply, slides into my wetness, as his mouth closes upon my ear once again.</p> <p>His mouth leaves my ear and he leans forward again, teasing my lips with his tongue. I'm sure I will come if he does this to me. He kisses me, but not so deep as to cause me pain. He kisses his way down my neck towards my breasts, licking and sucking each of them. I feel my body shift uncomfortably as his tongue slips back and forth across my sensitive nipple, and I can still feel my entire body reacting with shock. I'm moaning softly now, my body arching up as his hand makes its slow move to my thigh.</p> <p>He doesn't move away from my body though. Instead, he keeps moving up my body, taking his time, bringing me tantalizingly close, only to move away from me again after the same time as when he starts. He kisses his way down my body, kissing his way until he reaches my pussy. He slowly drags his tongue up and down my lips, circling them, and I can't keep my hands away from running through his hair when his tongue finds my clit. He teases me with his tongue, never going so far inside me as he has to the other ones already, only teasing me. I feel as if his entire body is on fire and is burning inside. His tongue is everywhere, teasing me, and the tip of his tongue caresses my hard clit. My body is rocking against his tongue even as my moans of desire for more come out in whispers.</p> <p>I'm not sure of it in the least, but I'm close to losing myself completely to this man who has just brought me to orgasm just because I have the audacity to speak the truth. He looks up into my eyes, his eyes shining white with need and desire; he wants to make this moment special...</p> <p>He sits back, his body still against mine, his erection sticking straight out from between his legs. He leans down and kisses my lips, tasting me on his tongue. "And I do mean, Baby Girl," He whispers, as his lips kiss my neck. "That is, of course, the beginning of you being what you truly are. But," he continues, "you also have my deepest desires. Mine." He kisses my neck softly yet passionately, and his words send shivers down my back. "Now, Baby Girl. You know how to show me what you want."</p> <p>He leans down and kisses me deeply, then starts to move down, running his tongue over my nipples. Then back up, once again. "And if you're not good enough, then I'm not going to make you any more wonderful than you already are." Then his mouth is once more against mine and his lips close once again onto mine.</p> <p>"Ohhh..." I moan, leaning up to meet him. A moan of frustration runs through my body just as he did the other day. I feel his hands begin to roam over my body, exploring and touching until they reach my breasts. He continues his exploration, making my body shudder the entire time. As if by the heat of his body, my nipples start to swell and throb. He continues down my stomach with light butterfly kisses, moving down my thighs where he comes to my treasure trail. His lips run along my inner thigh, slowly up to my pussy which is now dripping wet with desire and desire.</p> <p>Once again, I feel his lips, gently touching the skin of my inner thigh. He slides his hands down to my pussy, spreading his mouth wide as he does so. He kisses there first, his tongue running along my slit to tease meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
