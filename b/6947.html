"I really did the job and you had a great fuck! You're an absolute cock sucker."</p> <p>He looked down at me as if shocked that I gave the blowjob right then. When he saw my face blush at his sudden compliment, he reached out and gave me a quick slap with his hand. That actually made me feel better. It kind of bothered me to know how far I'd been willing to take him to give me the job. But at the same time I liked being the one in charge. "Yeah, that's true."</p> <p>"Thanks." He smiled as he walked me towards the bathroom.</p> <p>"You still owe me one too." he smiled at me as he walked by my side.</p> <p>"Are you kidding, I'm really good at that! Just like Mom."</p> <p>"She's not so bad to look at, is she?" he teased me as he held up his beer and took a sip.</p> <p>With a wry smile, I gave him a playful punch on the arm. "And, I love her so much that she'd never even consider what I like to do. It's pretty rare."</p> <p>As I turned around and sat on my bed after walking in the bathroom and peeling off the sweat suit from my body, I suddenly felt as if I was walking into a mirror. My pussy was wet. I could just feel how warm it was, but somehow, I felt that I was blushing even more, and I knew, I was blushing even harder and wetter.</p> <p>He came in my room a moment later and stood right in front of me. He didn't say a word, he just looked at me while he pulled off his shirt, kicked off his shoes and dropped his pants onto the floor. He stood there in his boxers, but he looked so good it scared me to look at him. He still had a slight smile on his face, and I didn't want to look. He turned and gave me a look as he stepped into a bathroom and pulled his boxers down, revealing his long, thick cock.</p> <p>I stared at his cock only for a moment before I looked up at him. I was still embarrassed about it, but I couldn't help feeling a sense of pride in him. It was probably his own little secret, but still. Even though we had known each other a few years, it still felt like we still knew each other a little more, at one time, even though we had no one living in our tiny little hometown in the middle of winter.</p> <p>With a sly smile on his face, I suddenly realized what a sweet, charming, and totally sexy boy he really was. It's hard to describe how much I wanted to be a boy, but at that point, I felt pretty sure his cock would have made my cock bigger, if I had sex with him.</p> <p>It wasn't my fault that he didn't even touch me when he came in through the door. That was all. We just kissed and then he asked me how I felt.</p> <p>"I'm still ashamed about that, honestly." but I had nothing to say. I just sat there, looking at him in the mirror.</p> <p>"I didn't want to be the one to tell you." he said, and I felt a sudden spark go through me. I had to say something. He pulled his boxers completely off, revealing his long cock. It's a really nice looking piece of man meat, I told myself. It's kind of hard to describe, considering how thick it is and how long in it. It was pretty big; bigger than I'd ever seen on any guy.</p> <p>I still can't quite fathom what he did to have a cock like that, but I couldn't help the way I looked at it when I was looking at it. I looked at it like that for so long that I just could not help myself. Even though I knew it was wrong, I couldn't help myself. It felt so different having a man's cock out in the open, seeing another man's cock in front of me.</p> <p>"Your turn." he said when he walked back into the bathroom and looked at himself. "You ready?"</p> <p>"Well, let's see." I smiled with my eyes closed as he pulled the boxers down and revealed his long, hard cock to my gaze. It looked a lot bigger than I had imagined, and he was definitely thicker.</p> <p>"Oh my god!" I muttered. "Does that thing really fit?"</p> <p>"I guess so." he sighed, then said, "But you're still so hot." He then reached out and took me in his arms and kissed me. He wasn't pushing things, he was kissing me, but he was definitely a different kindâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
