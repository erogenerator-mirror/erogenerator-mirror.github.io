He would have her right here, anywhere, anytime.</p> <p>He felt his balls beginning to throb as he continued to fondle the underside of her breast.</p> <p>The feel of her breasts had him close to the finish line now. He could feel the heat of mounting passion.</p> <p>Then he was on his way, to work a more vigorous hand job on her hard body.</p> <p>They didn't get around to making plans for the next date, but he would be a busy man to resist on her when she needed it.</p> <p>He couldn't stop touching her breast, the feel of his hand was becoming irresistible and his cock was hard again, and he was in need of a little relieve.</p> <p>And it wouldn't be long now. If she'd allow him to cum once more, there'd be a little more time left to savor her body.</p> <p>When she had recovered, she pushed him flat onto his back and straddled his crotch, easing her swollen pussy lips close to his cock.</p> <p>When she began to impale herself on his stiffness and began to rock back and forth, he realized that she was just about ready-to-cum.</p> <p>He could make out the flush of her cunt against her leg as she began to orgasm.</p> <p>"Hurry baby. Come in me." She kept her word to herself as she began to quiver and shake on his cock.</p> <p>He groaned loudly and shot his load into her with a roar.</p> <p>He let it go and relaxed his muscles.</p> <p>She turned around and sat on her heels to get a taste of her own orgasm.</p> <p>He watched her fingers disappear inside her cunt, working to bring herself off again.</p> <p>"Damn, I can't believe how quick you became horny again."</p> <p>"I didn't get to have the satisfaction myself, though."</p> <p>She giggled to herself, "So, you were going to do this, aren't you?"</p> <p>He smiled shyly back, "Um... yeah, sure."</p> <p>They sat together catching their breath for a moment, as he thought about what had been said.</p> <p>She reached down and picked up his cock, taking his hand and giving it a gentle squeeze.</p> <p>"Now get that hard cock inside me while you give me some rest."</p> <p>She led him by his cock toward the bedroom.</p> <p>When they walked in there, she went straight to the nightstand and got two towels, laid them over the foot of the bed.</p> <p>"We don't have time to waste tonight. So let's just get to it, huh?" she teased.</p> <p>The towel she handed him as he entered the bed was wrapped in a towel, so he simply reached over and wrapped it around his waist.</p> <p>When he was naked, she climbed into bed with him after covering his legs and his manhood.</p> <p>She slid around so that her body was facing his and they could kiss. After a moment, she reached down to take his cock in her hand and place it in her pussy in the way it had been when he was inside her mouth.</p> <p>She kissed him and stroked his cock lovingly while she lowered herself onto it.</p> <p>He wrapped his arms under her and pulled her down to meet his kiss.</p> <p>"Ooh-kay. That's great. Let's fuck, baby."</p> <p>He looked at her face for just a brief moment, and then reached up toward the nightstand for a condom.</p> <p>She looked at him and said, "Just in case. You won't last long."</p> <p>"I'll be okay," he promised.</p> <p>"Don't worry. Just get it on before I have to be alone."</p> <p>She got into the bed and got on top of him.</p> <p>He pulled her down on top of him and began kissing her again.</p> <p>His cock was in her pussy.</p> <p>He slid in and out for a while and enjoyed the feel of her in the warm embrace of his loins.</p> <p>He slipped his tongue in her mouth and felt her responding to his oral assault on her mouth.</p> <p>Within a few moments of each other, they became one.</p> <p>The two of them fell into a cycle of orgasmic bliss. Her cunt continued to spasm around his cock with each wave of passion he brought to the surface. She would come again in a matter of moments; his would begin to slow down; he would feel the urgency of his own orgasm coming on.</p> <p>"Oh-oh-oh-oh baby," she moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>After they had come together, they laid together in each other's arms, still connected.</p> <p>"I think I love you," she said.</p> <p>"I think you do," he answered.</p> <p>They were stillâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
