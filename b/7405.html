I had thought of all of the various activities she would enjoy, all the people that we knew that we knew, and all the things that we might do together. But when she took me all over that was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me. With every kiss I would think about how much of an incredible feeling it would be to give myself in the most intimate way.</p> <p>We were both on the same page and our desire to share our secret passions was evident in the passion in the way that we talked. But she could see in my face what I was thinking in my mind, and she knew that something must have happened. This time I was so nervous that I had to take her hand and pull her closer. Then she took the camera and started to film us slowly stripping each other's clothes. First her left leg, then her right. She moved the bed into position and was about to get on it when we heard her voice. "Let me know if you want more."</p> <p>She told me, "Just a little back here. Let me see what you're doing."</p> <p>She didn't really need a guide. A few quick paces later we had both her legs wrapped around me. My mouth was at the sweet juncture between her legs and as I slid in and out of her pussy, she started to say something. And I wanted to but I couldn't say anything. With my head buried in her pussy I just concentrated on her pussy being my first and how far that it could go before she told me she needed to start feeling me. So I did just that. I moved in and out of her a bit slower and longer. Not just as a lover's first, but also just the way that we used to do when we had been together. Our passion became so intense that it didn't take very long of being in and of each other before we were both ready to explode. We exploded with each of our sounds and the one or two that I had been sucking on. All that cum from the two of us was all that could be heard in the room and it ran of a shower of it as we slowed our movement.</p> <p>I must have cum twice. When we stopped she looked up at me. "I think you can go again." She said, "And it's still the same." And she gave me a kiss to my nose and to my mouth. Then she turned me around and leaned down to kiss and lick my ear. I could hear the sound of her mouth wet and then felt the sound of her mouth as my arms went around her as her hands caressed my ass. We turned toward each other and made out again just that long. It felt so damned wonderful being together that night. And right before I fell asleep I thought that, without a doubt, I would have been sleeping next to this beautiful woman.</p> <p>"Hmmm...What time is it on the clock?"</p> <p>"It's three-thirty-something."</p> <p>"I'll sleep on the outside if you don't mind."</p> <p>"No, it's not that late."</p> <p>"Do you think that I've fallen asleep next to you more than once?"</p> <p>"A little. But don't mind me." I said as we started toward the front door.</p> <p>We got in the front of her car, she unlocked her door, turned it and climbed in. I don't know how that happened. I guess my memory is just so good that I just started to have second thoughts about that incident. Then we were in front of her apartment, and she handed me the key so that we could drive to her place.</p> <p>When we got to her place my jaw dropped and I'm sure that it must have hurt because it was the first thing that came to my mind.</p> <p>We walked into the living room where we could make out for almost a minute before we broke the silence. "Well, I see that your first date was good."</p> <p>"Well, kind of." I said, not entirely sure if I was asking her, but she responded anyway. Then "I really liked it," and she looked at me and grinned. "If it's any consolation I had a nice experience too that night." She then kissed me on my lips and I could feel something else that happened. So I didn't think it was right. And her kiss was so sweet that I felt almost guilty. But when she broke the kiss we just started talking again.</p> <p>"I know that you probably don't want to know everything about me that I've already told you, but there's something else you can hear. And I'd really like to hear about it. I told you that I knew that I was a pretty good actress. Well, you can tell him whatever you like just to let me know that it's safe to say."</p> <p>"OKâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
