I was not going to do that kind of thing when I was in my early thirties to be a teacher at a mid-west institution, who didn't know I was even living it, if not in my own mind.</p> <p>My father's house, as I learned later, was an old three-storey one with a foyer that was more or less the living room of a family home. The entire upper portion of the house was the same as we grew up in. There were two bedrooms, one with a king-sized bed and a study room on the far side of it. The rooms were on the top floor and there were some rooms down the hallway that overlooked the back door of the old manor house.</p> <p>The main room was a large circular room that housed the same rooms as my room. The master suite was the size of my bathroom, but the same size as the one we both used, with just one bathroom of course. The living room and family room were as well and were set up as I would tell you to do in the middle of one of my older stories.</p> <p>"So," my sister, Julie, said to me, after she had finished changing and went out, "Do you think you could get some coffee, or just make yourself some toast?"</p> <p>I smiled at her and asked, "Would that work, Julie?"</p> <p>"Sure. What time is it?" she asked, obviously referring to the one she was still wearing that I was beginning to think was a thong.</p> <p>"About two o'clock. Are you okay with me calling and getting in at a bit later than that."</p> <p>"Sure. Just don't do anything I wouldn't do."</p> <p>"I'm just not sure who this guy will be."</p> <p>"Don't forget to bring along a small cooler, anything you've brought over here."</p> <p>Well, that's what I got for Christmas, a small cooler. I had brought the top I had been wearing when I was naked (yes, I still had sex!) along with the shorts (yes, I was naked, too) along with the top I had been wearing under my shorts since the second Christmas in my life. I'd also had an envelope, a note, with a list, and various other things that I knew I'd be needing when I arrived in town.</p> <p>At four the front door opened, in about two seconds, there was a knock on the door. As the door closed, it suddenly seemed like all the time my life had gone into a whirlpool. There was a knock on the living room door with the title, 'The Big Daddy Ranch'." It was all very strange.</p> <p>After I turned off my phone, I got dressed and took the few pictures I could find on the computer at the school library of my choice. I didn't go home that night, though. I didn't take the bus again that morning or the next day, either of which I received a few texts from my sister and her husband during the day. I was just hoping they would be at the ranch that evening, though.</p> <p>After my last class I had no classes to finish at the school that day. As I was leaving the school, I noticed out mailbox that there was a large envelope on the front of the mailbox there, next to my door, and I found it on the doorstep without thinking about it. It had the words, 'Baker Roberts'. It was a letter, a handwritten, but, not in any way dated, and it had the first line, 'Dear Jane, Please call me in a day or so. I want you and your son to visit, at least once, this summer, and will gladly have you, but I'll tell you where my last room is". My heart sank, of course, that I had not given my address to one of my family.</p> <p>I didn't know what to think about that. "But how will I get any time to meet him and what might happen."</p> <p>"Mr. B? You want to meet up with me. We aren't going to the Ranch, but I don't like to be in there and be a guest, either."</p> <p>"Sorry, Julie, you know my father. His truck's in town, if you don't want to go home with him and not get married, then you aren't welcome here."</p> <p>I looked at the address on his truck. It had a nameplate with my full name, 'Roderick Baker' on it, and it read, 'Baker'. I guess I had been in that small number of places for some time, so I didn't really know anything about it, and so it was probably an address he couldn't guess what I was looking for. I had never heard of anything like that beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
