The smile on her face was a look of complete pleasure. Not just a simple, genuine, sexual smile, but one of absolute satisfaction. She saw my hand move, taking her right hand, and placing it on her right breast. She felt the weight and the softness of my fingers resting on her breast. I could feel the weight and its hardness, it being pressed against her breast.</p> <p>At those words of love, the world around her fell away. With nothing but one simple, loving smile and a soft, deep exhale, she allowed me to place her hand upon the hardness of my cock through the fabric of my shorts. Her breast pressed against my palm, and her finger moved to trace the outline of it. I had seen her breast in the video, and had long since become quite comfortable with her other breast. I could only marveling at the size and texture of the flesh that filled my hands. The warmth of her breast was evident beneath the satin fabric of my shorts. I began to roll my fingers over her nipple.</p> <p>She was still smiling at me. She was enjoying my show. I leaned in and kissed her. There was no urgency in our kiss so much as the soft wetness of my lips caressing hers. Her hands returned to my shorts, finding the buttons one by one. They came easily open. I stepped my hand inside of the leg opening, and she slipped her hand inside. Her finger found my cock through the fabric and she began moving it back and forth while she pressed her breast against and against my hand. The feel of her breast in my hand was overwhelming. I could feel her nipple pressing against me through her thin dress. She must be wearing a bra, but the sensation sent shock waves throughout my body. I could feel my desire rising and the tension of my heart beginning to climb. I looked at her smiling face and saw the spark of life that had been lost in her light green eyes. I wanted her badly.</p> <p>I turned her face, her eyes opening with a mischievous grin. Their color was clear, and they seemed to glow. Her smile seemed to change and turn to a sultry laugh. She stepped back. We looked into each other's eyes for a second, as if looking for meaning. I took her by the hand, pulling her onto the bed and laying down beside her. Once again, I looked into her eyes. She did not move or move at all, merely opened her legs slightly. I looked upon her, and she saw that look. She reached up and ran her finger along the fabric covering her lips. I leaned my head toward her, and touched her cheek for a second, lingeringly. I leaned down and kissed her. I could feel the warmth of her breath upon my face. I reached down and touched her. My fingers traced down the length of her thigh as I looked at her face, which still had a little of the fire flickering there. Her mouth was still smiling, her face was peaceful except for her eyes. Slowly, we pulled apart. I placed my face onto hers, and began to suck gently on her bottom lip. I could taste the wetness I had been smelling. I could also taste the muskiness of the flavor of her lip. Her mouth was still smiling and breathing heavy with the intensity of our kisses.</p> <p>I could see the lust in her eyes. She held my gaze in her gaze for a few long seconds.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" she asked in a soft whisper. I pulled her with my finger, and she moved up towards the headboard, and out of my sight. I could see all the moisture forming there. I pulled away. The first contact of our lips came from her lips. Our lips were parted for a split second and our tongues were met, and our lips were pressed intimately together. She had closed her eyes and her lips were moist. I pulled away and opened my eyes looking at her with love in their eyes. She smiled and lowered her head. Her hands were still wrapped around my shoulder and I could hear her sighing as she came up on my shirt, and undressed me with tender kisses. I was a novice at this, even though I knew how to do the things that would arouse her, but I couldn't help myself. As we kissed, our hands began to play with each other's breasts. My finger could feel the hardness of her nipple through the satin of her dress, and the pressure of her breast on my finger.</p> <p>This must have been what she meant when she said she wanted me. She wanted me to caress and stroke her breasts in my hand. I had always found it sexy to touch another woman, in case she wanted to experience a particular type of sexual experience. I could not believe that this was even happening to me. It was as if I could no longer control myselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
