He put his hands in mine and I started rubbing my cheek on his shoulder. We pulled back enough so that I could lean forward a bit and we kissed. I pushed his cheek slightly towards his shoulder.</p> <p>"We can take this slow love." he said in a playful way.</p> <p>"Sure". He kissed me again and pulled back again. He kissed my lips as his arms went under me, I couldn't be sure, but it sure was soft and I couldn't wait for this to happen. His fingers found the button at my blouse and slowly unbuttoned it releasing the top two buttons. He kissed down my neck and nibbled on each breast gently pulling down the bra to the sides. His mouth made his way down into mine, taking in my lips, then my neck, then to my breasts and finally to my stomach.</p> <p>He kissed the inside of my thigh, it was slightly sweaty from kissing him earlier. By now, I was pretty worked up, my hand went to his head, my finger moved inside his hair to his neck, and he let out a moan when we went up to his ear. He let me go to speak, but I was already pulling it out from under my skirt. I started tugging his hair and his hands went under my skirt.</p> <p>"Please, don't do this...please."</p> <p>He stopped, a bit disappointed that I didn't say no, "You think the whole world is asleep? I can't believe it. How could you say no when you are so hot." "Don't you ever want me to turn over?" I just sighed and put my arms around his shoulders pulling him down so we were face to face, and I pulled him close against me. I didn't say a word, but pulled his shirt up under his chin until he pulled away and got out of bed.</p> <p>"We'll have to change that, you can stay if you want." I pulled him up to a standing position and we kissed again. My fingers traced his body up and down his body over and over. He moved down and started on my breasts licking and sucking my nipples. I tried to hold myself back, I really did. I wanted him so badly I could taste it in his mouth. I pulled my shirt down and let him take it off. We kissed again, I felt him move his head down to my stomach, and slowly, but with purpose, his tongue started to slide down.</p> <p>"Ooh, that feels so good,"I moaned. His hands came up and ran over my stomach as his mouth slowly kissed it down and down over my pants. I moaned out loud as his hands touched my ass. After kissing around my ass for a bit he pushed my skirt down and he kissed my thigh.</p> <p>"Come sit on the sofa love." He pulled it off, got on the sofa and laid back. I grabbed his dick and rubbed it over my clit for a little bit. "This feels good" I moaned. My face turned red but I didn't care I just smiled at him, and he was smiling back at me. I took my shirt off to turn around. I sat on the couch and he moved away from the couch to turn around. I just leaned back and pulled my shirt down, it just came off and went on the couch on the other side of me. He kissed my stomach and slowly slid a hand on my thigh, then over my mound, slowly he brought it to rest on my pussy. He kissed his way over my stomach and under my navel before he moved over to the other side of me, kissing, kissing, then finally making his way to my waist, he slowly pulled my skirt down over my ass and to the top of the couch. I stood up so he could pull my skirt down. I was glad that I didn't have any underwear between us.</p> <p>I had just sat back down when I felt his cock brush up against mine. His hands were all over my thighs pushing them apart then rubbing against my clit before pushing back down to my cunt. He started sliding a finger around my hole before sliding it into me. I was so wet from the last few fucks I had gotten from Ryan, and he was very tight. Just his finger going in and out and massaging my nub was enough to keep me on the edge, but he didn't let up and I was feeling so good.</p> <p>He pulled his fingers out, held up his dripping finger and I licked it. I tried to make his cock look good, but what the hell. I was going crazy the way my hips were shaking and he didn't even get me to put my finger in my mouth. He licked at my juices and kept sliding the finger in and out of me. I was panting I had been so close to cumâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
