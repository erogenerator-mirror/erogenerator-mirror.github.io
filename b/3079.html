Would you mind feeding her some? I know she will need the extra attention." He was thinking on his way back to work.</p> <p>"Sure thing, Jack." I turned on my phone.</p> <p>When I got back to work I noticed that the young guy on reception was right where I left him. It didn't make sense. I decided to go to my desk, put my paperwork away, and check the schedule for my day. It was late when I finally got to finish my paperwork for the day. I opened my purse, pulled out my laptop, and logged on my phone as I sat down in the small conference room.</p> <p>I opened my email to see if I had anything personal to look at, but there was nothing.</p> <p>"Who's been online, Jack?" a new email had appeared.</p> <p>I opened it, and got a few things right from the address. "Good Morning, Ms. Miller. I'm Jack," I responded.</p> <p>"Hello Jack, sorry I interrupted you, but I couldn't understand what you were writing so I was wondering if you knew of someone?"</p> <p>"Yes, Ms. Miller."</p> <p>"This is Ms. Martin, I'm pleased to meet you as you had been calling for several weeks. I would like to invite you to the company party that's being held tonight, if you would like to have dinner with us." She gave a smile and a wink.</p> <p>"That would be fine, Ms. Miller. I will get to it as soon as possible."</p> <p>"Excellent, Jack. In that case, you might want to sign here." She gave me a big smile, as she opened up one of my private email logins.</p> <p>This was not the first time she had given a good overview of my work experiences. She had been a great assistant to me when I wanted to find a person for office fun with benefits. She made sure that my work was very professional so my only concern was my personal life.</p> <p>Her office was small, which meant that there were only about fifteen people on the work group that day. Most of them had already left. The only one left was the young man who had been chatting with my mom during the lunch break. We had been going out and had caught up on some of our past and future. She hadn't said much while I had been chatting with her that would go any further. I had never met a person in my school that she was interested in and I was hoping she wasn't a lesbian. She hadn't spoken to me in the past six months and was going to continue to talk to me more about herself. I couldn't help but wonder if she had been one herself.</p> <p>"So, Ms. Miller, how can I help you today?"</p> <p>"I wanted to meet some people that I know and want to get together. If I didn't know you so well, I would have called earlier."</p> <p>"Great, I'd love to meet you and see how you feel about me today. This is getting to me."</p> <p>"I'm glad to hear that, Jack. It's been a long time since someone has been like me. It's kind of exciting to have someone that I'm comfortable with talking to me and to know that I can talk about anything that we have done."</p> <p>We hung up the phone, looked at each other, and said we wanted to meet at the company party that I was interested in, and get to know each other a little better. We decided to go to his house first and get some lunch, since he was going to be there too. He was going to be waiting for us there as well.</p> <p>He looked over at me and smiled. "Have fun, Jack," he said, before closing the door on me. I had a little trouble getting control over my emotions. I was thinking about what he had said, and wanted to know exactly what he was thinking and feeling for me. Then I saw him. The smile was gone. Instead, I took a deep breath and opened both my eyes. I sat down in a comfortable office chair, took my eyes off of him, and said "Ok, so how did it go?"</p> <p>In his mind, he could tell what he wanted to hear. "Well, this is actually quite a coincidence. I did hear that you took the phone off your cell when you had lunch with me, but I couldn't understand anything you have to say."</p> <p>"Oh. Well, this is actually very interesting. You see, I actually started my research for the project before I went to college. I decided to study this stuff myself. I'm now getting the idea that you are one of my students. Of course, with that in mind, I would be more interested in your work experience. So, where would you like to meet?"</p> <p>"Doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
