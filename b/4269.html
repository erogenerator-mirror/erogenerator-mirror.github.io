"Maybe a coffee this time?"</p> <p>She just nodded, then stood. I was going to get dressed and get out when I realized we still had an hour and a half to kill.</p> <p>By that time I was in a hurry.</p> <p>Back at the table, there was coffee by the time I got there. I took the mug right out and made sure I washed it down quickly, then drank it while I was waiting. About an hour and half later I was getting really drunk.</p> <p>We were sitting and drinking a glass of wine when she got up to pee.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go home?" I asked.</p> <p>She nodded a bit more forcefully than I had.</p> <p>"Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, getting up.</p> <p>"We'll go out for a walk and you can go with us," I said, standing up.</p> <p>"How about a walk?"</p> <p>"Sure, like what?"</p> <p>"We'll give you directions."</p> <p>"I don't feel fine." She looked around, and then took a breath. "I just walked on the edge of town and saw a light on in the next building. I knew I could get a cab over here."</p> <p>She thought about that a bit more. "Do you think you should use this light to light your way home?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, then looked around again before responding. "Why?"</p> <p>"Because it's your life now!" she said. She seemed a little calmer now as we finished our glass of wine.</p> <p>"No more walking out?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure. The light is out," she said, smiling. "If we go out again that light will be going back in. I don't think it will do much, but I think we should get some food."</p> <p>"That would be nice," I said.</p> <p>"You can call the fire station, if you want," she said, looking at me. She shrugged and then smiled at me.</p> <p>When I returned she looked almost relieved. "I'm going to go back to the apartment, to have some coffee until I get back again, but I'll be back in a while."</p> <p>"Okay, but have a drink before you go, and put the blanket back on," I said, and then turned to her. "You can come back with us when we get back here."</p> <p>She nodded and we headed to the car. It was time for us to drive.</p> <p>When we got in the car, the lights came on and the light came on again. I went and got my coat and some clothes, then checked and out of the motel. I had about half an hour before closing time there. I had one question, should I call the fire station at three that's just about how long we had been waiting around for them to get a good idea what I was looking for.</p> <p>It was ten minutes before they arrived. All three of them had already gotten their own coats out of the closet and were heading down the sidewalk. I noticed that I hadn't gotten any coffee.</p> <p>"Where do you think we're going?" I asked. "We need to get a blanket, and some ice."</p> <p>"I didn't really think we had time," she said. "I was just thinking about how long it's been for us."</p> <p>"I need to get a glass of water first," I told her. "They don't know how long I was out in the cold tonight."</p> <p>She nodded and we walked out to the highway. I parked and put the car in the left lane, and she got out of the car. I was behind her as she went around to the passenger side and opened the passenger door. She got in and I closed my own door. It was just a little after four in the evening now and we got in the car and I started the engine. She got out of the car.</p> <p>"Are you going to walk around in the dark?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nah, I'll use the light."</p> <p>I went around the back into our apartment building. I didn't know why she would want to live there and she was certainly still a very beautiful woman. I felt like an idiot. We drove for about twenty more minutes and finally she was leaning back against the inside door of the car.</p> <p>"You sure this is okay?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's been really nice," she said, looking around at the buildings. "I think I'm starting to like this place."</p> <p>"I don't know about that," I said.</p> <p>"It's nice here," she said.
