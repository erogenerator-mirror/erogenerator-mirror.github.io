He asked me.</p> <p>"Not since I was nineteen," He smirked.</p> <p>"So you've never tried out for that?" I asked him.</p> <p>"A few," He admitted. "That's probably why I'm here."</p> <p>"Then what? This is what you'll get for being such an ass? You want to fuck more of my classmates or fuck some random guy up the ass. You're all just going to have to be more selective than you are, okay?"</p> <p>"That's easy," He assured me. "It's just so weird to think about someone else. To think my friends will just look at me and wonder why, and you know all this."</p> <p>He put a hand to my cheek and kissed me, sliding his tongue into my mouth. I let him, sucking against his kiss and letting him hold me close. I melted into his kiss, his tongue exploring and entwining with mine as his hand caressed my breast and moved down to cup mine and toying with the nipple. I felt the fire in his hand, the heat of his palm on my breast and the hard nipple within.</p> <p>He broke the kiss and began caressing down my neck, leaving a trail of kisses down to my collarbone. I felt the heat from his lips leaving little trails in their motion across my skin as he licked, nibbled, and lapped at my breasts.</p> <p>"Fuck this," I groaned when he took a nipple between his lips and began sucking on it, rolling that nipple into my teeth.</p> <p>"Please baby, touch me," I begged him. "Please. I need you so bad."</p> <p>He continued to play my breasts for a minute, drawing on them, rolling the nipples in his fingers, before releasing them and moving on to the next one. His mouth never left my breasts, kissing along my collarbone and leaving a trail of kisses down to the slope of my breast. I felt the hot trail of his breath against my nipple sending a jolt of anticipation through my body. He bit me, hard enough to make my head move against the wall, so I leaned back against the wall.</p> <p>He took the other breast gently into his mouth as he continued to suckle from my bosom. Finally, he moved so he was laying beneath me, his head lying on my leg.</p> <p>"You taste so fucking good," He breathed against my flesh.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it," I moaned.</p> <p>"You feel incredible," He remarked.</p> <p>"So do you," I answered back as I rolled my hips towards his face.</p> <p>He began to kiss and lick the inside of my thighs and my stomach, then his tongue slowly went into my belly button and laved it with it, tasting and teasing me with his touch. My back arched and I moaned around his tongue, arching my hips towards him. He kissed his way up my legs and my thighs, lingering a little, licking and nibbling, finally coming to my sex. He kissed the crease of my hips, leaving it slick and moist, and then he began running his tongue up and down on me, kissing and biting at me so that my whole body quivered and trembled beneath him.</p> <p>"Please, baby," he moaned against my crotch.</p> <p>With his tongue on my clit, he sucked my lips into his mouth, allowing himself to run his tongue across them, flicking at the exposed bud. I moaned loudly when he did this, pushing his head against my hips, wanting him to go deeper. My muscles tensed at his touch, and instinctively I ground down on his face, moaning against his lips as my fingers dug into my calves and my body shook.</p> <p>"I'm going to come," I announced weakly.</p> <p>"Me too," He responded eagerly.</p> <p>"Do it," I begged him. "Do it."</p> <p>He reached between us and took my fingers between the two of us and began massaging them, drawing them into his mouth, tasting my pussy and making me squirm. My hips shook as I tried to find the rhythm I needed, wanting so badly to come and let my mind go blank. There was no way that I was doing that with him and no one else except my boyfriend and my parents. I wanted it from him. I couldn't stop what I was doing.</p> <p>I felt my own body tense when he released me from his mouth, my fingers still in his hand, gripping his head in a death grip, but he continued to suck on my fingers, letting me know that he wanted more as well.</p> <p>"Oh, baby," I moaned.
