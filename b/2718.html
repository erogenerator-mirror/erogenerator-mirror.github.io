"You are just the kindest person to even ask."</p> <p>He just looked at her, not answering, then looked at the ground and smiled. She couldn't help but smile back and feel that little twinge of sexual excitement again just thinking about him. How could he be that old? He was so nice! She just had to get to know him!</p> <p>"So?" He asked. "I'm sorry, I was out of practice."</p> <p>"It's ok, I'm not even fifty yet."</p> <p>"Do you still have a girlfriend?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not even twenty yet and I've been saving myself up for years. Why, do you want to hear my story?"</p> <p>"Well, don't tell her about our experience with the pizza and you know how many girls you see in porn, how many people have your body?"</p> <p>"Oh God, no! Not a thing!"</p> <p>"Well, you know about me, about when you're with my dad."</p> <p>"I don't know what to say." I'm a married man and if you are interested in some sort of relationship with me then I guess it has to be ok with you. I just never did meet you. I'm a straight male and, well, it shouldn't bother you if I'd met you but, well, there is a bit of a mystery about you and, I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. If you're interested, just answer the 'why" questions in the next little while, I guess we can just get to know each other. I have to get back to my husband and find out more about him."</p> <p>He laughed again and reached for a piece of pizza, "It's ok, actually I'm just going to go find a better place to eat, I'm not about to stay if that's what you mean. We can talk and you can talk to me here."</p> <p>He started to leave and she grabbed his arm. She looked up at him, then back to the pizza and leaned in close. "Thank you, thank you so much," she said, then kissed him.</p> <p>He smiled, "Oh, you're welcome. I don't know if I'll ever get used to the taste of pizza."</p> <p>They were sitting at the counter and she pulled him away from the counter. He looked at her and smiled. "You're the nicest person to ever see, I can't thank you for that. I'd have to get over it, it has nothing to do with me. I'm looking forward to meeting my realtor in New York next month. If we can hang out a little, I'm sure I'll find another woman!"</p> <p>She smiled and leaned forward, placing her hand over his. "I can't tell you much about my life until tomorrow, I can tell you now, but, you'll understand."</p> <p>He laughed at that. "You've already been with other men and have had sex with them."</p> <p>She smiled, "There are some things I was into back when I met my husband and when I went to a club with his parents, I had sex with a guy. I was so excited that the next day I was on my date with a man and we were in a club and he came home to me.</p> <p>"His name was David and he used to have a very pretty wife when I was young and then he married her. You never met her because I'd told you that you had to be on your own so I went to her house and fucked her in her bed. I couldn't get the thought of her doing that out of my dick.</p> <p>"I had to find other things to do back then, even though I was married. I was also involved with the local police department and had to go to all kinds of trouble to get a warrant to arrest and keep the place quiet while his parents were in town. I still wasn't able to get out, I ended up spending the night in jail."</p> <p>"He got married? How? Who?"</p> <p>"It was a girl I met at a club when I was young and it turned out to be a little more than that. She was a little wild and I'm sorry so we didn't have sex. She was really pretty, I would have never tried it but, I wanted to if you were interested in me."</p> <p>He looked at her, trying to read her eyes, "I am interested, I was looking forward to being with youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
