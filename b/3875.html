I say, "you have only the bare minimum" And with this my voice gets louder.</p> <p>"Are you serious?" you ask again, a little nervously.</p> <p>"Yes," I answer, "You can do me anything you like you just do not have to!"</p> <p>"You said you wanted to do this with my ass, right?" you ask, "You're serious?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I say, "Take your hand off me right now, please!"</p> <p>I wait for you to withdraw your hand and I am frustrated.</p> <p>You look at me and ask, "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I say with confidence "You've just proved the depth of your desire and your want to do this!!"</p> <p>"What if I say no?" you ask, "I mean, I like doing it right and yes I would do anything for another chance to have you do it right, but I don't really want to go all the way with you!!"</p> <p>You don't say a word and just lean into me and hold me, gently. I put my arms around you, kissing your soft cheeks.</p> <p>"It's too risky, and you feel too good, but don't worry I'm not going to try to force it!!"</p> <p>"I've never tried to force anything," I say.</p> <p>I love your eyes and I wonder how they feel on my face, on my eyes, on my eyes.</p> <p>"It's alright," you say. "I'm glad you like to do this."</p> <p>"Well," I say, "This might, in a moment, be more than I ever imagined!"</p> <p>I smile at you, "You've given me a lot!!"</p> <p>"That's good!" you say, "Because if we do this it may be the last chance I will ever have to be alone with you!!"</p> <p>I look up at you, feeling a little silly, "Are you sure?"</p> <p>You smile and look deep into my eyes, "Oh yes, please!"</p> <p>We lay on each other for a while and look at, you, yourself and the ceiling, our breathing becoming more and more labored.</p> <p>I caress your cheek and lean down to kiss you. You respond and we kiss again, our bodies pressed together closely. Your hands move to my back, and then your hands move to my breasts. I can feel them pressing into us as our tongues find each other, swirling and dancing together.</p> <p>You reach around and undo my bra. I shrug the shirt off, and you sit up a little to remove your own t-shirt. Once naked, you lay back with an amused look on your face, "Well," you say, "You never do" and you caress and caress me. You're right, my breasts are really, really large and very sensitive and I can feel your hand moving over them as you caress me. Your fingertips travel back and forth over my nipples feeling them harden. Your lips run down over the skin of my stomach and you part as you kiss my bellybutton.</p> <p>Then you slide your hands up under my hips, and you caress the softness of my pubic hair.</p> <p>I arch my back and groan, "Oh yeah," I say, "now you're really making me feel good!"</p> <p>You kiss up my body to my breasts and caress them. I wrap my arms around you as my hands find your penis, which responds instantly to my touch.</p> <p>You're excited as ever, but just as excited because you know this will last.</p> <p>You feel my excitement and as we are moving together we can both feel it.</p> <p>You gently roll me over on my back and kiss my eyelids, my eyes and nose, my mouth, my mouth, my neck and I love the feel of your touch.</p> <p>As before when you roll first me and then you, moving into the spoon position your penis touches my clitoris... and you let it massage it a bit as you lay next to me.</p> <p>I caress your face with my hands and we look deep into each other's eyes. Slowly I begin to kiss you again... and then your mouth as it moves down the side of my neck... my ears... and down the left side of your face.</p> <p>My mouth moves lower... kisses my cheek, along the nape of your neck, and then in between your shoulder blades.</p> <p>And still your hand moves slowly down on me... down over my lips... down over my nose... down over the top of my chest and back in between my legs.</p> <p>Your penis brushes my lips in the light and I kiss it, lightly running the head againstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
