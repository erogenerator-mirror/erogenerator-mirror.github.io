Did I just read her right? Am I reading her right?</p> <p>The night continued. After dinner, where things got even crazier, and after we had done a few rounds of rounds, we decided it was time to go to the den and I sat in a chair opposite her. We made small talk, mostly with the movie as well. It was quite a bit different than all of the others - and I felt rather than heard a lot of the jokes with it in general. A lot of it came from an open and honest relationship, and I don't mean I didn't like it with it. It was also pretty normal. I had always thought of this movie as 'sensual fun'," she said, "but I don't recall ever hearing it as the kind where the partner could act out his desires. Or so I thought. I mean, maybe that's my favorite sort of movie of all time...you can't be too sure."</p> <p>"I think it might be," I agreed. "It's something that happens in the mind of one partner, a bit like sex in general."</p> <p>"I thought so myself...that wasn't the best story ever," she said, her voice catching. "But it did make for an interesting experience."</p> <p>"It has," was my conciliatory reply while holding up the video remote.</p> <p>"Ah, so the movie really does have an orgasm," she said.</p> <p>This was getting awkward now. This was getting my blood rushing into my ears. "You can't say those things."</p> <p>"No they don't, but the 'F-word' is used when describing sex act," she said with a smile. "It's how we communicate that gives us power over people to think about, so we can think."</p> <p>"I guess you're right," I agreed.</p> <p>The movie was still on. When I went to switch it on, the only one left in the player was a picture file and a message attachment, which I opened before I connected it, "I think you can say that too."</p> <p>The movie was still on, and the sound came to my ears, which was a bit like talking to my mother with the volume turned down low. She was lying back on the pillows on my bed, smiling at me the way I looked at her. I couldn't help but notice the large difference in body shape. And for the first time, her breast was as firm and perky as the rest of her. I had always thought that women didn't look more beautiful, and seeing her in that state was a first for me. But I now found out I was not only biased, but somewhat right!</p> <p>I had to think back to this movie once more, seeing her as she was. "That was sexy, wasn't it?" she said, reaching out her arm and squeezing my wrist. Then she drew my hand to her bare breast, pushing her breast out as I had done. She continued to feel me through my pants as she kept talking to me, occasionally putting her hand over mine. I was glad the video had stopped, not that I minded. I guess she was feeling a part of me like I had been feeling the last time...and she was liking it all. What could I say? She pulled one of my hands away from her breast and squeezed it hard. It must have been very uncomfortable, but I didn't think it went much further than that. I was surprised her grip was that strong, but I was also kind of surprised she did that, and she was enjoying herself so to speak. She seemed like she probably would say something to show she was being a little possessive when she wanted me to just go along with it...at least that was my intention.</p> <p>"Do you masturbate?" she said, her voice soft and seductive with just a hint of a smirk and a twinkle.</p> <p>"Sometimes," I said, my voice wavering a little when I did, thinking it might be my first time with a woman.</p> <p>She chuckled again. "I'll bet you do," she said. Then she grabbed my wrist again, forcing it back down to her breast, pushing her nipple even more toward me as though to test the waters with some extra pressure. "Are you a virgin?"</p> <p>"No," I said, feeling that I had to admit that. She had always acted a little bit shy with me around, but I just didn't think she had been a single guy.</p> <p>"Oh, then we have something even sexier than that." She brought her hand to my crotch while still staring at the screen, and she stroked me slowly, deliberately, causing me to react before I could actually react. "We have something I think you can really get excited about," she said, as if I could ever disagree with her.
