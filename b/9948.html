She replied. "It was my first time in my room, and I'm glad it's over."</p> <p>"Me too!" He replied, smiling, as he stood and took his pants off and threw them on the bed. She watched him as he pulled his underwear on and then stood before her.</p> <p>"How does that feel?" She said as she slid next to him, and then sat with one leg on either side of him.</p> <p>"Good." He replied. "It feels kind of lonely there."</p> <p>"I'm the hostess here and I don't mind." She replied grinning, before leaning over and kissing him.</p> <p>"Megan, that was nice." He said, pulling her onto his lap and squeezing her with his arms around her.</p> <p>"Yeah, if it was ever lonely, then you are one hell of a lot better looking than me." She said as she kissed him again.</p> <p>"You know..." He trailed off, still holding her hips while he kissed her neck and shoulders. "I think about you all the time." He told her with a chuckle.</p> <p>"So do you. I miss sleeping with you." She murmured as he kissed her shoulder.</p> <p>"I could lay there all night if you would like." He said quietly. "And I think you could really spend the night." He whispered, before kissing her again, and pulling her face closer to him by her chin. "Or..." He added, as he kissed her. "I would...you know..." He kissed her lips, before adding. "Or, I could sleep all night...you know, naked and in your arms." He whispered as he kissed her lips again.</p> <p>She held him by his hips, pulling him against her. The kiss was passionate and they both had to get up to go to bed. After kissing her once more, he said. "I really do miss you, Megan. It's just...wow". He chuckled, feeling a blush creeping up her neck as she took off her shirt. "You're a really sweet man." He murmured, as he stared into her blue eyes.</p> <p>"So are you." She replied reaching up and running her fingers through his hair.</p> <p>"I really do miss having you here with me sometimes as well." He replied, as he ran his fingers down her shoulder and around her neck as he kissed her mouth once again. "I hope you don't go to jail." He whispered softly before pulling away and standing, and then pulling her into bed to cuddle by her side. "You know, I might have gone to jail if you couldn't be here with me." He added, as he laid a comforting hand on her arm and whispered. "Oh, you'll be ok." He promised.</p> <p>"I am." She said softly. "I just wish I could really spend the night with you." She said as her hand wandered over the bare skin of his chest and found that he was naked under his trousers. She smiled at him as she leaned over and kissed his lips. "Do you want to go to the shower with me?" She asked softly as his hand trailed down over a breast.</p> <p>"I wish we could as well, but it's going to be a long night." He replied quietly.</p> <p>"It'll be our little secret." She added, as they both smiled broadly and fell asleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
