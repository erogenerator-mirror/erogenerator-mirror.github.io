I can make breakfast for both of us if your mother and I want it."</p> <p>"I'm not sure that will be fair to my boy. What exactly does she taste like anyway?"</p> <p>"That isn't for you to decide."</p> <p>"No. Let's get this out of the way. When you get back to your room, we'll talk about how your mom looked this morning."</p> <p>"Okay, see you in a little while," he said as he headed out of the kitchen.</p> <p>"Hmmm."</p> <p>It hadn't gone that well at the party. At least not the party. She and Brad didn't get along that well. Not that long ago. And she was more than a little scared about him. She hadn't felt that way about anyone else before. But she found out during an hour of chatting.</p> <p>"I'm glad you found your Mom attractive," she said over her shoulder. "You won't be seeing her again for a while. You'll just have to go."</p> <p>"I know. I'm just not sure what it is with women," he said.</p> <p>She walked out back to pick up her dinner but she stopped a few feet behind him on the way out.</p> <p>"Honey I got something for you," he said excitedly. "It's on the table."</p> <p>She just looked up at him and smiled. What a goodie coming! "What's that?" she replied.</p> <p>"It's the last of the dishes. You want them done?"</p> <p>"I do," she exclaimed and reached for the dishcloth. He was behind her so she could reach up and take hold of each dish with her thumb and index fingers. He pulled one of the towels, which had been wrapped around his waist, and she handed it to him.</p> <p>"Here, take my towel," he said with a wink and a leer.</p> <p>"Do you really think it'll go better on you than it does?"</p> <p>"Oh I think I can do better than that," he said as he took her hand and lifted it to his lips, kissing it.</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>"I hope you're not planning on leaving your Mom there," he said as he kissed the back of her hand. "Mom's not even in bed yet now."</p> <p>"I hope so," she said as she looked at him with sparkling eyes.</p> <p>So what had she been thinking? Brad had her in his arms just before they left his apartment! She had actually been attracted to him! It had taken him so long to convince her to do anything like this at the party that he was afraid she might just take control. Now she was in his arms and they were about to make love.</p> <p>"It would be so nice if Mom's good to you every day," he said as he started pulling her close. "Don't you worry!"</p> <p>She just smiled and looked up at him with half closed eyes. His arms were around her pulling her close and she felt so nice. She looked down at the hem of her nightgown and saw that it was just below her bellybutton. A little extra was already exposed this way. It was so lovely to finally be so intimate with someone for the first time. She looked up into his eyes and took her arms from around him.</p> <p>"Mmm. . ." was all she could get out. Brad just smiled and pulled her tighter against him, her breasts pressing against his chest. He cupped her lower back with his hands feeling the heat from her body. Her hands were up in the air now, resting on top of his thighs.</p> <p>They swayed around so enticingly for a few seconds and then relaxed. It hadn't been that long before they really got going. In fact it had only been a few minutes. As Brad stood next to her he took hold of the bottom edge of her nightshirt and slowly pulled it upward. Then he slid it up her body. As it was up she did her usual slow upward-stroke just like before. He kissed her neck and shoulders as the hem of her nightshirt had lifted further. The thin material of her nightshirt came together with little more than two buttons each, but there was the hint of her nipples, already hard as pencil erasers, pointing toward the ceiling as they jutted upwards. As they continued their downward progression between her breasts he took one of her nipples into his mouth and softly chewed on it.</p> <p>"Mmm. . ." she cooed as she lifted her head to press her lips against his. Her lips were so soft and pliable from the earlier excitement. They tasted salty with a kind of tartness she found both sweet and sexy.
