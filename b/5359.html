I appreciate your consideration."</p> <p>"I would certainly give you a compliment but it won't be a compliment on your looks and skills but your kindness and courage. The more I do here, the better my eyesight will be. But now leave it open and we'll talk in private," He said, leaning over and gently kissing her lips.</p> <p>"Now that we're clear, can we talk?" Sam asked as her pussy throbbed.</p> <p>"Sure let's do that. What's to talk about?" Jim asked as he walked her toward the bed.</p> <p>Jim watched as her long legs curled under and around his waist and she began to undress him. He took his dick in his hand and began to slowly stroke it. She moved over to him and leaned into his mouth.</p> <p>"Mmmm so good...I love having your cock in my mouth." She said as her lips met his in a passionate kiss. She broke their kiss to slowly lower her shoulders down to his dick. Sam had always loved taking his big dick in her throat, but today she was going to take the whole thing in her mouth. Her tongue started working around the head, licking the sensitive area behind the head. Her fingers worked his shaft as he started to increase the pace. Jim let her know that he was getting close so she moved her head down and sucked his big balls into her mouth. He couldn't believe how good she was sucking his dick. He could feel her tongue stroking them as she sucked them and she used her hand to run them in a circular motion over his sac.</p> <p>"Oh yeah Sam...that's great. Take all of me." Jim said as she began to lick up the length of his dick. He could feel her nose pressing against his cock as she took him in her mouth. Her mouth was taking his entire shaft and she was stroking him slowly at times.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum soon. I'm gonna...going' to...get there." Jim said with a smile as his dick began to grow harder with each heartbeat followed by his orgasm. He took one of her nipples between his teeth and bit down hard, causing Sam to cry out in orgasm and he continued biting her nipples. As he continued to bite her nipples he felt her pussy start to clinch down again. She squeezed her thighs together as she felt her pussy tighten. Her body shook and her pussy squeezed down around Jim's dick. Jim pulled his dick out of her mouth and began fucking her as he felt his dick expand.</p> <p>"Oh...oh...this...is...am...oh...oh god...I'm going to..." Jim gasped as he felt her pussy contracting, milking his hard dick. He felt his orgasm rushing as the waves started in his dick and he shot his cum deep into her pussy. His dick swelled and exploded as he filled her pussy with his cum. They held each other tightly for a moment then separated. Jim pulled her down and they kissed again then again as they fell into the bed.</p> <p>Jim was the last person to get up because he had to work tomorrow. In his hotel room he could still smell Sam's wonderful scent as she lay in his bed.</p> <p>"Sam?" Jim asked as he got out of bed and headed into the kitchen.</p> <p>She replied with a sleepy smile, "Yeah? You want me to make you a sandwich or something?" She asked as her eyes opened and she saw him staring at her from behind the kitchen counter.</p> <p>He smiled and handed her the sandwich and sandwich and replied. "That sounds good, but I think we need to talk some more before bed."</p> <p>He sat the sandwich down and placed his feet on the counter as he continued to sip on his drink.</p> <p>"Ok. What is it, Sam?" Jim asked hesitantly.</p> <p>"I think I know what you're talking about." She said as she took a seat at the island counter with one of the small, white mugs, set it on his thigh and put both hands behind it.</p> <p>Jim picked up his drink and sat it as he looked at her, "So where is it from? You look like you were in college a long time ago. I know you took a few courses in college but I never thought you would get a job in college." Jim replied as he set his eyes on Sam's face.</p> <p>Sam smiled as she looked him in the eyes, "I graduated at the top of the college ladder. I'm the only one who's graduated. How about you?" Sam asked as her gaze looked his body in the eyes.</p> <p>He moved her arms away from her chest and smiled, "You won't have to do much to graduate if you decide you want some school or a career. If not I am a good teacher. I teach students the whole classâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
