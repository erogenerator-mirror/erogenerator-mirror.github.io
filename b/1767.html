I mean how are you going to explain how you didn't get that, and how you didn't get it tonight?"</p> <p>He laughed, a rich rich laugh. "It's my fault."</p> <p>"It didn't work."</p> <p>"The part where you got to sleep in the spare bed wasn't a coincidence!"</p> <p>"I was asleep in my own bed!"</p> <p>"And in a place where I wasn't at all likely to be. But I'm beginning to think you enjoyed it, so don't be too hard-hearted and start talking."</p> <p>"What?!" She almost yelled.</p> <p>"It's too late to stop now. We'll just have to start over!"</p> <p>"If you're sure!"</p> <p>And with that we were off.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Once home I spent hours, one by one, playing with a lot of toys and getting hard and imagining what could happen if he could get to her. It was as if she wasn't real and we had never actually had an actual sexual experience. Just thinking about it made me ache inside. I wanted her to know that I was real. Then I imagined that it wasn't as bad as she was thinking. She would know I was real. It would be easy just to forget about anything.</p> <p>Finally at night, he came home and told me I was his toy. That he couldn't stop thinking about me. He said he knew I couldn't be with her long anyway so why not put it off until we got back home? I didn't think I could go through with this anyway, but he convinced me to start again and then it was over.</p> <p>It was dark when we got home and I was so turned on that I couldn't take my eyes off him. If it was that easily I was going to have to tell her how I felt. He couldn't make me admit it, so I decided to pretend it was a dream and that I didn't have to admit anything really.</p> <p>When we reached the door I told her that I still loved her. "It's just that you're so easy to love."</p> <p>"I'm not that easy to love." She said. I told her that would be different. I was going to make love to her, but this time we were going to make love as soon as we could. That was the plan, though. It was a plan I had told the person who I loved it was.</p> <p>*</p> <p>That last night I had never thought of the relationship but with her I realised all the time. That was it. "It's not love you don't understand...", she muttered quietly. I didn't answer her. I just hugged her, and pulled her on top of me, where she could get a good look at my body and I could play with it. My heart, too, had finally broken down some but there was still love there.</p> <p>It had been all I could do not to rush her off me then and there.</p> <p>"When could we start again?" she wanted to know as soon as she had got her breath back. "We might as well. I don't know when the time has come."</p> <p>"You don't have to. You can go home and never meet me."</p> <p>"I know, but I wanted you to meet me, too. I didn't know how you'd react, but I do know how you feel. I like being with you, and I like it even more when you've felt my love. I like making love, too. I haven't felt that way for a long time. It must be part of who you are. You're a good girl."</p> <p>"But you shouldn't say that about me."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>There was a long awkward pause as we both let it all sink in. Finally, she asked the 'what?' question.</p> <p>"I don't know... what can I say?" I said.</p> <p>I couldn't explain it, but she was right. After a long pause, it was obvious she hated that subject so I pushed it away. "I think we might be okay if we start over in another place." We kissed again with passion and she took me in her arms again and it seemed as if it was all the same. But it was only for a moment, and the look in my eyes told her it wouldn't be long before we were back home.</p> <p>**</p> <p>Back home for a few hours and we were both very relaxed. She had gone to visit mum for a few days in her own time and I was happy that it was getting back to the way things had been.</p> <p>It was my birthday and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
