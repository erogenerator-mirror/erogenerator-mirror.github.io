It's just that I was wondering if we could swing by and swing by tomorrow. We've all been there too many times, haven't we? I mean, I know all about that, but I just really have been looking forward to seeing you all the time and doing it again with you!" he joked, as he pulled at the towel.</p> <p>"Sure! Sure! We'd love to have some fun!" replied the girls together.</p> <p>"I just love watching you with the whole cast" said Paul "I can't say that I'm complaining!" He grinned at the memory of his time with his old flame and added "I wonder if it was all worth it?"</p> <p>"Well, it all depends on you." replied the little boy again "but I'll be watching you next, and loving every minute I can get!"</p> <p>As the girls came by, they were now looking back at their new friend, the young man who had just come into the living room. Both their smiles widened as they could feel their nipples harden as he held out some paper bags of candy.</p> <p>"It's just the usual stuff we bring back from the airport" Paul said "but we've got more goodies there than usual here. And we can't go to the airport until early tomorrow!"</p> <p>As they approached, they saw the boy's face lit up with joy!</p> <p>"This'll certainly be nice!" he said with enthusiasm "I've always liked to have the girls over one last time!" he grinned.</p> <p>"Oh, and the boys also!" explained the others "I bet if we went over to your place and spent a night with the boys, you'd like more fun!"</p> <p>So there he was at the end of the line, talking with a bunch of girls all waiting for him again, and they were all going to have him one after the other, just like he'd agreed. The young man grinned broadly as he said goodbye to the girls and hugged them each in turn.</p> <p>"Well, I think I'll hit the sack tomorrow night!" he said proudly, "and thank you so much!"</p> <p>"Well, we'll be looking forward to seeing you again!" replied Paul "I can't wait to see the two of you!"</p> <p>"Well, maybe you can't wait too!" replied the boy.</p> <p>"Honey?" asked Paul.</p> <p>"Are you crazy? If not, we're just going to have to wait until the morning for my treat!" said the girl, "and we won't feel like we're getting a second invitation from you!" But she smiled a cheeky smile as she spoke and he was sure that she was teasing him.</p> <p>"I guess not. I'm not quite sure how to tell you that?" he replied.</p> <p>"Oh don't worry. You won't be seeing that until now, will you!" she retorted, "And I'm going to have some fun with you too!"</p> <p>"You'll have to do more than that!" said Paul "I promise, but just think about the fun!"</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
