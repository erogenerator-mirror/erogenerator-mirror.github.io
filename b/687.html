I mean, I'm kind of busy at work and my boss is really busy as well so this is my weekend. I'm going to visit my Aunt Elizabeth and Uncle Bob before I leave for my new job in Houston for the summer."</p> <p>"So when you go back to school you should come to see it sooner?"</p> <p>"Yeah right. In fact I already have that done."</p> <p>"Really? I'm glad you're finally going to get out to visit some friends from school."</p> <p>"I am."</p> <p>"Cool. I'll be able to put your things in your closet when I get back. See you soon."</p> <p>"I'll see you later."</p> <p>"I will." He hung up and turned to go out the door.</p> <p>***** "I'd love to go with you to The House," he heard his wife say to a young man on the other end of the phone. He didn't hear her voice clearly but from the sound of it she sounded drunk. He answered the phone right after answering and it was a girl. The man spoke for a minute or so before hanging up.</p> <p>"That was fast."</p> <p>"Yeah, but I have to give her a call at work. She's going to have a whole conversation with you, especially since she's going to be at The House."</p> <p>"Damn, I'm sorry. Are you going away with me for a little bit?" He asked of what he hoped was an innocent joke.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm going away with a little bit. I don't know where I am or who I am going to be going with. My flight isn't until Monday afternoon and we don't want to spend time together because of it."</p> <p>"I'll stay in touch."</p> <p>His heart dropped when he heard her voice and how much she was telling him and it was the hardest thing he had ever done in his life. He hoped he would understand and he would even be willing to do just a little touch and feel. That would be enough to take all his troubles away.</p> <p>"Well I better catch up with you and see you later when I get off work. I'll call you."</p> <p>"I'll see you tonight if you're still interested. Bye."</p> <p>Mike was sitting at a small table in the back of the house and couldn't believe his luck that someone would call and answer immediately. He had been sitting there drinking a beer and didn't think about it.</p> <p>"You still there?" a voice asked quietly behind him.</p> <p>"Yeah, sorry I'm supposed to be at the restaurant and my shift ended a bit before I got done eating."</p> <p>"Well don't let the phone get away from you."</p> <p>"My shift ends after dinner, I guess."</p> <p>The voice laughed then said out loud. "I'm glad your still there, it's going to be a long day tomorrow."</p> <p>"Good, thanks. Is your wife home? It's Sunday."</p> <p>"Your wife doesn't get home until tomorrow night."</p> <p>"Thanks. Can you call me later tomorrow afternoon? It's been really busy in the last few days and I'm really getting ready for another big weekend."</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe."</p> <p>He felt his spirits lift again and he felt a smile cross his face as he imagined her in his apartment. He would have his very own bedroom and his little boy would have his own apartment and he would have her. He had a feeling that he would see her tomorrow also.</p> <p>***** It was Wednesday morning when the house phone rang at 6:00 a.m. before Mike was due to arrive home. It was Elizabeth and the young man who answered the phone was a tall, well built man with dark hair and a well built built physique.</p> <p>"What's up?" he asked the man.</p> <p>"That young man came down for a visit. I didn't realize he stopped so soon."</p> <p>"I wasn't going to be able to leave him alone for long. I didn't really tell him that I was going to be at the house, I just told him that I was going to be at the house."</p> <p>Mike had heard them but had been looking for a longer period than usual. He wasn't sure where they were going for a visit, or any longer, but there was always time for one at the end of the day to enjoy a good time, that was all he had to say.</p> <p>"Thanks for calling, I appreciate it."</p> <p>"I appreciate it very much.
