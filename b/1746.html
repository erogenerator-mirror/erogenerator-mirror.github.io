She felt the need to feel him.</p> <p>She turned to face him. Her hand reached out to him and she stroked his cheek. They stared into each others eyes for a long moment. She was about to kiss him but he moved back.</p> <p>"No. Not here. On the beach." She said softly.</p> <p>"I know." He said. His hands found hers and she sighed. His lips met hers, his tongue thrusting its way into her mouth. She sighed too. His arms wrapped around her again, she melted against him. When she felt the warmth of his lips on her cheek she wanted everything she ever had to remember in her whole life.</p> <p>"Let's get out. We want to eat." She said finally breaking the kiss and breaking the kiss.</p> <p>The two of them walked back to her room where her room was.</p> <p>When they got in the room she turned to him. "We have much to talk about this evening."</p> <p>"Yes." He agreed.</p> <p>They sat on one of the bed, he pulled out a chair and set the chair up for them.</p> <p>When they sat down, she looked at him, "I haven't done this yet." She told him.</p> <p>"It is important for me to know that you are doing it because you want to." He replied.</p> <p>"I don't know. If you want to I would do that for you too." She said.</p> <p>"Okay." He said.</p> <p>She sat back and started to relax. She watched him as he got to know her better. For the first time in her life, she really started to realize what she was feeling. He told her that he had felt something similar when he first met her but they hadn't really talked about why and now they were just going to be friends and do things together.</p> <p>"I'm not a lesbian." She told him.</p> <p>"No, I am." He told her.</p> <p>In between kisses, they were both telling how they felt their feelings for each other. One of which was the love they felt for each other.</p> <p>"I love the way you feel. I really feel that way." He told her.</p> <p>"I felt that a lot back then. It's been different with you and me." She told him.</p> <p>"I know this sounds complicated." He told her.</p> <p>"It is." She told him. She reached up and gave his face a kiss as she spoke. She pulled back and smiled at him.</p> <p>"There's no hurry, I'm sure."</p> <p>"I'm sure." He said with a smile.</p> <p>He brought his knees up onto the bed, his legs slightly apart. She took a moment to look at him. He told her how attractive she was. She told him she saw him looking at her and he turned to look at her as well.</p> <p>"I know because I watch you watching me." She told him now.</p> <p>"I was watching you." He said softly.</p> <p>"Good." She told him as she leaned down, bringing her head in to kiss him.</p> <p>They kissed. She pressed her body firmly against his and brought her lips to his. He kissed her passionately. His hands began to roam over her body as they made out. He gently squeezed her breasts and ran his fingers along her skin. She continued to make out with him and began to kiss his neck while he explored her body.</p> <p>After a bit, she pulled away from his mouth and began to rub up and down his chest, then down to his stomach. He looked down at her and saw that she had her eyes closed and was smiling all the time. His hand moved slowly down from her breasts to down her stomach. She smiled up at him as she felt his hand reach out and slowly run along her stomach and up against her now naked sex.</p> <p>For a moment he stopped moving. He looked to her to see if she would object. She smiled as her eyes fell closed. Suddenly he stopped and looked at her.</p> <p>"Do you want to do that?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh yes." She said, smiling again.</p> <p>"Okay then." He said and they kissed again.</p> <p>She reached down and grabbed his cock and began to stroke him.</p> <p>She looked at him. He was still looking at her. He put his hand back to her breasts and began to fondle them again. The smile never left her face as she continued to look at him.</p> <p>"Is that what you were waiting for last night?" He asked her as he began to move lower.</p> <p>"Yes. God it feels good." She told him.</p> <p>She spread her legs wider and herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
