"Oh, I want you now," he added, as he rolled me on top of him and got into the right position.</p> <p>I reached back and found his bulge, and squeezed, massaging it in place with my hand. He raised his hips a bit, then slid a leg off the bed, opening himself up to me. He looked deep into my eyes, then lowered his head and started licking my clit. I looked down to see him work on me, taking me closer and closer to orgasm, and I gasped, pulling him to me. He slid a finger into me, sliding up and down my slick hole, then began plunging them in and out, and I was panting and bucking against his mouth.</p> <p>"I'm cumming, too!" I moaned, holding his head tight to my groin.</p> <p>I felt his tongue slide out as his finger slid in, and he rolled me on top of him. "Give me more," I said, and he did. I pushed, and the head of his cock slid all the way into me. It felt like heaven as he entered me. I pulled him tight to me, and felt so good. Then I relaxed as he started pumping me faster.</p> <p>I had to do a little "swim" to ease all the friction. My knees trembled. I kept pushing against him, trying to feel him going deeper.</p> <p>The pleasure grew, the pain less. We kept moaning and sighing, both trying to cum. Finally, I could take it no more. I lifted myself off him, pushing him back, and we rolled on our sides, facing each other.</p> <p>"Thank you," I whispered, with a smile.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," he whispered back. I ran my hand through the dampness of his hair and kissed him.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I can't tell you how we got together. My heart ached for him. His kisses felt like honey to me. We had always said we were both going to start our relationships in our own special way...and the way it was going would be one of many, all different.</p> <p>"Maybe we should do this," I told myself, as I watched the clock on the nightstand. He should be getting home in maybe an hour, which meant...he probably was, already. My nipples hardened at the thought of what I might be doing...</p> <p>He was wearing briefs again. No doubt he wasn't wearing a bra, either. And I had already seen...I mean...his cock was as hard as I could make it, and I couldn't imagine how I was going to be able to sit still on it for long.</p> <p>I got on my knees, and he got to his feet, standing there. His shoulders were tense with expectation. I could see a drop of pre-cum start to escape his cock, and he saw me lick the drop off, and he smiled.</p> <p>I knelt, and began licking him up and down his shaft, licking off some of my own cum. His pre-cum was salty...and his head throbbed with pleasure, and I knew what he wanted...that he also wanted.</p> <p>"So, this is going to be a special evening," I said, with a grin. Then I pushed my tongue back into his mouth, and slid my tongue down into his neck and onto his jaw. He moaned with delight as I kissed my way down to his ear....</p> <p>"Mmmm," I whispered...and kissed his lips and ear.</p> <p>As I was kissing him, I knew what he wanted...to be kissed...that I had already given him everything he wanted.</p> <p>I pulled away slightly, and slowly started sliding my tongue along his lips. He was breathing hard and moaning into my ear, which seemed to drive him wild. Then I slowly kissed his chest, and then his stomach...and all the way down to his cock.</p> <p>"Oh, Jeez!" he moaned. "I want to touch you," he said.</p> <p>"Please do," I whispered, and kissed his cock, and then slowly took the head into my mouth...slurping my own pre-cum over his head...working on the slit...sending a few pre-orgasmic shudders through him...</p> <p>He was looking down at me, eyes closed, lips pursed...I ran my tongue lightly all the way up the length of his cock...over the head, and up again...up to just under the head, and then back down again, licking it along the sensitive underside....</p> <p>"Ohâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
