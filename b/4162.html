He's my kid," I smiled softly.</p> <p>That got me to thinking.</p> <p>"Oh, and what about the boy, and this other one, and this one's not?" She asked, turning to look at me.</p> <p>"Y-yes, I suppose. We'll just have to see what happens. Do you mind if I call him?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nah, we're good," I said in a voice almost a whisper as I pulled away from her grasp. "The other guy is a friend of yours, so I hope he doesn't mind if I share the story," I lied, even as I made my way toward the back of the bar.</p> <p>"Oh...okay. Let me go and go up and get him. I want to know everything, and you want to hear him," I said, holding my own.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, tugging me along with her.</p> <p>I grabbed the kid and gave it a big hug, but she didn't budge. She was a wreck. I had to hold on to her to help steady her when she started having serious hiccups.</p> <p>"I really need to get out of here. Please help him get warm," she said, wiping away tears. "Please," she said, and we left.</p> <p>She was still standing in the doorway, but I held her as she cried. I could see the love and concern in her eyes, and I felt guilty, but I knew that I had to take it from there.</p> <p>My little girl was my child, now. She was mine. I put my arms around her, held her to me, and then, without thinking, I kissed her. It was an automatic response that was automatic when I felt my little girl being kissed. It's hard to explain, but when I had kissed her for the last fifteen minutes, I still felt that connection.</p> <p>But, now that I think about it, it's not what I felt. But, with her here, kissing me, and knowing just how hard it would be for me to say no, I didn't feel like I wanted to say no. I felt like the woman from this bar was my baby.</p> <p>Finally, without her showing any inclination or regret, I pulled away and said, "That was very nice, and very sexy. Maybe we should do it again, but that kiss will be over soon."</p> <p>She looked at me, her eyes sparkling. "But, you can't take advantage of me like that."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure I can," I assured her. "You're just doing it for me to make me feel better."</p> <p>That was true, but I was starting to get used to it. It hadn't done much for me physically. Sure, I liked the way I felt kissing her, but that didn't necessarily mean that I really wanted her. I certainly seemed to want what I'd been looking for all my life.</p> <p>But, to have her again, to feel her in my arms, to feel her body against mine, to feel that love, made me want something more. The problem was that I had to figure out how to start my life the way that my little girl had wanted mine to. I needed to find out if I could turn her down. I needed to try to make her the same way that I'd wanted her.</p> <p>"I can't stay mad at you long enough for you," I continued as I took in her expression. I wasn't going to stay mad at her for long. "I think I might be ready to tell you about me..."</p> <p>She nodded her head, knowing what I was trying to say. It hadn't taken more than a few seconds for me to get her to take control. I was determined to tell her everything.</p> <p>"I've never really tried to have sex with a boy," she said. "I really haven't, but I'm looking forward to having it anyway. I'm so nervous sometimes."</p> <p>"You're nervous. Tell me," I insisted, trying to convince myself. I really was nervous. "Tell me just how you feel."</p> <p>"I'd never have it the other way around," she said. "I mean, you've never been with anyone before, right? Not even me."</p> <p>I felt like a mother who'd just told my little girl that I was gay. Well, I guess I didn't know that she was a lesbian, but I'd had a couple of boyfriends, and I'd had a couple of dates with guys, and I knew that she would eventually become a sexual being, and I had no intention of doing anything to encourage that.</p> <p>"What are you afraidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
