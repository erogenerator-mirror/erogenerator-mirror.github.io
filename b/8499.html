I'm going to change and get ready for the trip, when will you be home?" she said.</p> <p>"When," I said, "you're staying in the guest room and I'm going to change in the guest bedroom. Do you have everything?"</p> <p>"Yes, I have everything I need."</p> <p>"Ok. I'll let you have it when you need it," I said.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said. Then she went and took her shower.</p> <p>I put on a bathrobe and went to the guest bedroom. On the other side I stripped off my robe and went to the guest room. She was not there. It appeared that she was just washing.</p> <p>A few moments later she came in and shut the door.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" she asked.</p> <p>"We're going to my bed," I replied.</p> <p>"Ok," was all she said.</p> <p>"Wait," I said as I opened the bathroom door.</p> <p>She turned sideways with her back to me as she walked into the bathroom. She turned to close the door as she stopped. She was looking at me.</p> <p>I reached out an offered her a towel but she stopped.</p> <p>"No," she said. "I want you to take off your robe." Then she slowly turned toward me, took down the towel in one motion and then lifted to reveal her nakedness.</p> <p>As she turned and faced me she reached up and cupped her breasts. She lifted them as she ran her hands over and around her nipples between her fingers. I put my robe on and closed the bathroom door as she did this.</p> <p>"Are you sure that's what you want?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Can I see you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She looked at me and then reached out her hand and held the side of my face with her hands as she raised it to her lips. I leaned toward her and our lips came together. My hand moved up to her breast cupping it I leaned toward her and our lips touched. She opened her mouth and our tongues touched each other.</p> <p>We kissed for ten or twenty seconds, which was the longest time of my life. She broke the kiss and looked intently into my eyes.</p> <p>"Can I see you naked?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied.</p> <p>"Take off your robe," she said.</p> <p>I hesitated. I had given my consent but now there was more to do than that.</p> <p>"You're kidding, right?" I said.</p> <p>"Never, of course. You'll look more as if we're going out for dinner," she said.</p> <p>"That's not what I meant."</p> <p>"What is?" she asked.</p> <p>"This," I said.</p> <p>Her hand went to the zipper and pulled down the zipper. I stepped out of my robe, leaving it on the floor. I got my shoes off and then kicked them to one side. I looked at her as she stood there looking at me standing there naked.</p> <p>"Come with me," she said.</p> <p>I took her hand and we walked toward my bathroom. The shower was on the right side of the tub, as were the towels on the left side. We reached the shower first and washed each other. She was standing there with her arm around my neck as we soaped each other.</p> <p>I felt her pussy getting wet as we soaped each other. We moved so our bodies were pressed together, I could feel her nipples brushing my chest. We kissed again and got our tongues in the crook of each others mouths. Our hands touched each others bodies as we kissed, caressing one another. We were standing in the shower, my hand on her breast, her hand on my cock, as we moved together.</p> <p>She broke our kiss and took my hand and led me into the shower. As we stepped toward one another I turned away and we kissed again. Our lips touched briefly on each other's lips before we released each other. Her hair was flowing behind her as she turned to look at my nakedness. I stepped toward her and stood over her. Our lips touched, tongues met, as my hand cupped her breast. Her nipple was as hard as a pebble when it was squeezed. I took her nipple into my mouth and lightly sucked on it as the other part of her body jumped. She moaned with pleasure.</p> <p>We kissed again. I rubbed her pussy and felt the moisture from her pussy increase as I rubbed her. My hand dipped down her slit and between her legs. I dipped my finger into her hole, then stroked back and forth.</p> <p>She was gasping for breath, "Oh God," she managed to sayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
