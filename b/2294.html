He would have loved to tell her, but didn't, knowing it would make her feel that she couldn't tell him, that he wouldn't go to the next concert.</p> <p>His head was getting tired and he felt he would be asleep before the music even started. He was just going to wait until they had gone back to his room anyway.</p> <p>A little more time passed and he had to change his shirt and pants, his head started back into the room with him just standing. His head was pounding and he found himself staring at her. It was the same moment that she got him, the moment she had first kissed him, but this kiss, their tongues first, he was not sure to what had made his head hurt so much.</p> <p>He felt his breathing slowed quickly once her lips parted, his hands slid to her hips pulling her tightly against him, they were still only a few feet and they really knew each other. She pulled her mouth back slowly and said quietly, "You okay?" and when she had he could only nod. The words took a little of the wind out of his sails. Her tongue snaked out slowly and lightly touching his lips. He was confused, he had never even seen anything as erotic as that. The touch of her tongue was so soft against his, he would have loved it to do more. He opened his mouth and her tongue snaked into his mouth. He sucked on her tongue, it tasted good but he didn't want to kiss her again.</p> <p>Her hand found his lap and slid up to his neck. The contact had caused him to pull her tight against him and he didn't want to let go of her when she moved that close to him. She kissed him more, and bit his lip. She pulled back and looked into his eyes. She could not deny him any longer and had no intention of letting him walk away.</p> <p>Her hands were resting lightly on his cheek but he didn't see them, he was shocked to feel them touch him.</p> <p>He felt a little embarrassed, this was the first time he had ever kissed someone. He had always thought it was cute that she did nothing but watch him. He felt his face getting flush again, he was starting to get wet, he knew he wasn't as good as she had admitted when they kissed, but he didn't care.</p> <p>"I'm sorry" she whispered, "I don't know what came over me," she looked at him waiting, "Are you sure you don't mind?"</p> <p>He looked at her. He didn't know what to say back, something else was wrong. She was moving again and he felt his hands slide to her face and start covering it. They kissed again and he opened his eyes to look at her.</p> <p>"That's better" he said as the kiss was over. He could feel her body moving against his, he realized that her jeans were doing an incredible job of hiding her excitement. He could see the wet spot she was making in her panties as he moved her shirt up and then over her head exposing her beautiful breasts. Her nipples were hard and her eyes were wild. He was watching those dark orbs moving when he moved his hand to the zipper on his pants. It was an easy enough release, he was holding on tightly and all of a sudden it felt like a bolt of electricity had hit him. He was shaking when she pulled his zipper down, he tried to turn in his seat to release his hard on. The movement of his body was more than he could have ever imagined. His fingers slid around the head of his cock and started to move the precum off.</p> <p>"No! I don't need any more of this" she said quickly. "I can't do this!"</p> <p>He laughed a little but couldn't help but look at her. His hand had found her breast and he had moved slightly to the side so he could put his hand on her side. He heard her groan slightly as his hand moved around her chest as she did not move her hips to get his hand closer. His heart started to race and he was afraid she wouldn't do what he wanted, even as she was still standing. She was so close!</p> <p>She had on her underwear, she had no underwear under the fabric that it held her skin. He thought she must like it just as much. He thought she must like to see him looking at her and if he saw her, there could be no backing out now. His hand finally made its way back to her crotch, it was still a little damp and hot. He slid his hand between them just enough to feel the dampness, and started moving his hand around her clit. He could feel she was trembling, it wasn't the first time he had touched another woman sexually, she had had a manâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
