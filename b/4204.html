"Is that because I'm not your best friend? I'd rather not be."</p> <p>The way her arms around me tightened made me feel uncomfortable. "Yeah, but we can stay just as long as we want." She sighed. "We can do it here. I'm sure as hell going to get used to it without having to see anyone for a fucking month."</p> <p>I smiled again, not so much because of her but because I felt like I was in my own little worlds again. "Okay... if you say so."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>We hadn't had sex in days, I should have guessed. I had barely had an orgasm that day, and was pretty sure the following day would be equally intense.</p> <p>A few minutes later, and she came awake. She looked at me and giggled, making me a real believer. "Hey, you wanna sleep next time?"</p> <p>I looked up again, a little embarrassed. "What?"</p> <p>"I know it's not your fault, so if you're all that interested in girls next time?"</p> <p>"No, that's okay. Who knows. You'd be up for being able to look at a girl?"</p> <p>"I guess that is possible. Maybe once you're here."</p> <p>I was still a little taken aback by the situation. "I don't know. I just have a feeling it would be more like being with another man to me."</p> <p>"Well you got a boyfriend, right? He's a very good friend."</p> <p>"Yeah. He's a little shy about being around others. Plus, you're the guy who brought me here."</p> <p>I felt a little better. "Thanks for saying that."</p> <p>I felt guilty about the way I handled the situation with my girlfriend. I knew it was something that she just wasn't doing in earnest. I couldn't be that way. For whatever reason I probably shouldn't have been thinking about it, and it would have made me feel sad. As I thought about it, all I wanted to do was go back to being happy with my life. If my relationship with my girlfriend had ended up with a breakup where I was feeling so bad, I probably would have felt different.</p> <p>But she had left me. She made me feel like I was in love, that I had fallen for my best friend. I don't know how I could be able to look at her when my best friend isn't even my best friend.</p> <p>I sat up in bed, falling back down on the covers with a sigh. "Fine. I can live with that."</p> <p>I looked at myself in the mirror and laughed softly. It was true. I had fallen in love with my best friend and I could not let it destroy my life. I turned away from the mirror and wrapped my arms around myself, turning to sit on the bed. I looked at myself and started crying. I wanted to make sure I was okay, but I couldn't do that if I did. I was so confused. I tried to think of a way to ask her about it, but couldn't find anything to say that would convince her.</p> <p>I cried hard on the bed for a bit. The only consolation that came out of it was that I couldn't think of a single thing that would make me feel better or to see any of my best friends in a good way. The more I cried, the more I couldn't figure out the next thing that would set me free of everything in my life.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>I guess I shouldn't be telling this story but as soon as I got home, I knew something had happened and I didn't want to put anything into the story I had to share with a friend. I decided to give it one more day, so I logged off my computer and got in my car and pulled out.</p> <p>I knew I would be taking it easy the next couple of days, so I had no idea what I would do.</p> <p>*****â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
