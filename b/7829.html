I'm not going to give you anything."</p> <p>"What do you want? You can do anything with me after I'm gone. I'm yours, for as long as you want me here, right here, right now," I said as I handed my keys over to him. He took them and walked down the street. I followed him out into the cool night air. He handed me a bag from the back of his van.</p> <p>"I got you a little something," he said and I handed him a large package. "I hope you like it."</p> <p>It surprised me that he said something like that. He hadn't even really said anything about me getting him anything. I took the wrapping off the package and walked him over to the side of the car. He unlocked the side of the van door, then got in and closed it behind him. I went around and sat down on the seat.</p> <p>"There's an extra chair in the cab for you to lie out on," I told him and he nodded. I grabbed the bag and set it on the bench between us. "We have another bottle, but we are not going to start it until you are sure you are ok."</p> <p>"I'm ok. Just let me lie out for a few minutes," he said and he leaned back against the seat. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, waiting for him to do something. "You just watch, honey," he said as he took one last look at me.</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>In the darkness of our back yard, I waited for him to finish moving his things and get out the small box of toys. I set the bag down while I got out of my chair and went and sat on the seat with the blanket on my lap. My head was starting to swim and just as I was starting to wonder if I'd get a hang of it, I felt something.</p> <p>The light shined on a pair of green panties. I opened my eyes and it wasn't some kind of panties. It was a pair of green bikini panties. I saw two large pinkish-brown triangles that were tied behind my neck. They looked soft and light in the warm night, but at the same time looked so erotic, a shiver went up my spine and my whole body felt warm and a blush filled my cheeks. I sat up and put my arms around my little one, taking it's soft pliable body in my arms and kissed the top of it. It's only after a very small bit of light on it that I realize why they were there -- they were in the small bag.</p> <p>"You are so gorgeous. I can't wait to get down on all fours right inside," he said and I leaned back against him. "How did you make them?" he asked as he took one of the panties from my hands.</p> <p>"They are your birthday presents. We wanted you to have them when you can wear them."</p> <p>"What?" he asked as he brought his fingers to his nose and sniffed the panties.</p> <p>"It's my birthday, too, John," I replied and I laughed as I took off the panties and handed them to him. He took them and put them in the bag and I took the panties and put them in my hand. He took them and handed them to me. I had my eyes closed and I was smiling. He sniffed the panties and then put them in his purse. He pulled my panties inside and threw them away. I let out a slight groan and tried to relax as he handed the last few things to me.</p> <p>When the van stopped and I opened my eyes, I saw that he had changed the lock, locked the door and was walking towards the back of the van. I sat back in the seat as I watched him take his own pair of panties off and walk to the back of the van. He stopped at the driver's side of the van and looked inside. "Well?" he said with a smile.</p> <p>"So?" I asked as I rolled up a pair of soft pink, soft, light cotton panties. I knew that I would feel a lot prettier down there while he read them to me.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful when you don't have to be wearing your panties to be with anyone," he said with a smile as he put the soft pink pair on.</p> <p>"Well, I don't have to be in any trouble if you put these on. Even for the short shorts you got here," I said as I put them on. When he looked at them, he asked them how they looked. I smiled and pointed to the crotch of the panties.</p> <p>"I think these belong to you today," I told him.</p> <p>"I thought so too, but I don't think people would ever notice," heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
