You're too small to get hit. Let's see a shot to try and see how close you can get.'</p> <p>The two men stood and quickly began swinging down and down hard. I couldn't tell how close he had gotten. He came down one-handed and the third guy came down in half the distance.</p> <p>The man with the gun shot first one-handed, then the other. The guy just continued to swing, but his hand caught the first guy.</p> <p>By then I had the feeling that the man on the outside had a gun as well. He swung one more time for good measure. It looked like it was going to make a big dent in his arm.</p> <p>Two shots rang out and the guy with the gun came back after dropping the guy he was with. He was now down by the gun with its barrel raised and looking down in the dead-eyed, terrified eyes of the man on the inside.</p> <p>'I guess we better pull the trigger,' I said with a chuckle.</p> <p>'That's for the camera guys. I'll take the first one, then you can both move out to the back.'</p> <p>I turned and gave each of them a nod and a nod of the head, then walked around the cabin just as the other two men had started shooting at them. One on the top rungs of one of them stood, then swung out and up towards the door. As the doors opened he said with a grin, 'Fuck.'</p> <p>The first man yelled out, 'Fuck!'</p> <p>The two men took one shot up the stairs and got a little jump away before they hit the door. It was on a narrow beam and the wood was the only thing that might not have allowed them entry.</p> <p>There was an open doorway leading back to the cabin and I heard him say, 'Come on in.' It just so happened that, once the door was open, there was a narrow window just slightly above the window pane. The room must have been small but it was obviously well lit. There were four or five people down there. One was a man in his forties or early fifties and one had a short, fat bald man and some other guy, both with large guns.</p> <p>'I can't believe this. I thought the two of you had come to help me, but now you have taken over I guess that doesn't surprise you.'</p> <p>'Whoa, let's go inside,' he said as he got off his own shot.</p> <p>The man was clearly in charge. He pulled out five or six magazines and showed them to the man sitting on the couch who had a blank photograph of the couple on the couch. He pushed the photograph and the other two that had been on the chair next to it out in front of him.</p> <p>'There's enough of that to give you enough trouble,' he said. 'Don't get distracted by them. All of them.'</p> <p>The other two men made a gesture suggesting they would start looking for some sort of safety deposit, but he just waved them off and said, 'Okay, go ahead. Whatever you do, just don't make a sound. You're not going anywhere.'</p> <p>He motioned for the gun man to go ahead and pointed it in the guy's direction, which he did. The gun man nodded and went off, but the other three were too far back in there to notice what was going on.</p> <p>I had been shooting my second shot as well, but the man just stood there, unmoving. The first man was moving his weapon to the center of the doorway and pointing it. The second man was shooting at him, but had already turned back to the door.</p> <p>The second man moved out into the hallway towards the bedroom, but in his peripheral vision he was pointing the gun at the bedroom door. The first man went down in one stride then pulled out his gun.</p> <p>The second took the pistol, held it up at eye-level, and began firing at the room beyond. It was a couple of feet beyond the doorway, but he was standing and swinging it back and forth in mid-air as he reached up and grabbed it. The gun flashed and the barrel rose and fell from the man as he continued to hold it up.</p> <p>The first two men went to where the gun was pointing at the bedroom door. One had the gun pointing at it and the other was holding the weapon at eye-level. When the second man stepped forward they both fell to one knee and held their mouths open like they would be gagged.</p> <p>The man next to them took a deep breath and nodded, 'All right, all clear. I don't think that'll do it.'</p> <p>The man in the arms was shaking violently again and the first man, I think he was in the middle of a scream, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
