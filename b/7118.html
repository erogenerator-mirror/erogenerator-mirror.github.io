I asked her, as I slipped my hand under her skirt.</p> <p>"No. That's fine by me," she said.</p> <p>While my fingers were still inside, I lifted her skirt slowly, slowly, until only her panties remained. I lifted her skirt so that her panties would disappear even further.</p> <p>Finally, when I saw she was completely exposed, I said "Turn around."</p> <p>She did so, facing forward. She took the waist-band of her panties and lifted it off.</p> <p>"You can have my panties," I said. She didn't hesitate.</p> <p>When her panties were off I stepped forward and put my hands on her bare shoulders and then my body on hers. She had to help me to pull the front of her panties down, and she quickly sat down on my lap. Our bodies felt like one now, only separated only by a thin wall.</p> <p>I kissed her mouth, then her neck, and then finally her breasts, kissing and sucking on those wonderful teats. Her left tit was the source of pleasure, and I sucked on it lightly. I nibbled on her nipples while I sucked on her right. She moaned and gasped for air, but I wasn't quite ready yet to let her have her release. I gently rolled her nipple between my thumb and index finger, and she shuddered even though she was quite capable of being on the brink of an orgasm. I moved down her upper body, still kissing her softly.</p> <p>"Your lips are wonderful," she said almost in a whisper.</p> <p>"You're not ready?" I teased her.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes. But maybe I'll make you."</p> <p>I slowly pulled her sweater up, and finally allowed my fingers to slip under it. I held it up against herself, and could tell they were going to be very wet. Just a moment before, they had been as soft and squishy as when my fingers were on her right tit. Now as soft and smooth as they were, they had to be wet with her own arousal.</p> <p>I slowly slipped her sweater over her head, and let it fall to the floor. Her white blouse was clinging tightly to her body, but also showing an incredible contrast between her bra and her dark mary-jane. Her nipples looked like pebbles, and even from there could be seen the bumps of her areolas.</p> <p>I slowly unbuttoned her blouse, and pulled it down.</p> <p>"Oh, this doesn't count! I still can't believe this is happening!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>I looked at her as I slowly removed her panties.</p> <p>"I know. This is just the beginning."</p> <p>I stood up and slowly undid my trousers. She helped to pull me out of them and down my briefs, which were still wet with her own juices. I stepped out of them and took her hands, to lead her back toward the sofa. She did and followed. I took off my shoes while we stood, and I stood next to the sofa with her standing on me. I spread her legs as our upper body neared the sofa. I began to slowly rub my hands up and down her thighs slowly, enjoying the softness of her skin.</p> <p>She continued to softly moan as I rubbed her upper thighs. I could now feel the warmth between them and my cock began to harden. I leaned over to kiss her lips at the top of her thighs, and then started to kiss lower, until I reached the junction between her legs and her pussy. My kisses were now hot, demanding kisses, and were slowly bringing her up the slope of pleasure. When I reached the sweet spot between her legs, I could smell her arousal. It made my mind spin with delight.</p> <p>She was moaning steadily now, and she was trembling. I took one of her legs in one of mine and bent it over the arm of the sofa. I lifted her leg so she was fully upright on the sofa and then placed her bottom on the cushion next to where I could face her. The softness of the arm of the sofa and the cushion was comforting, and I leaned over and kissed the softness of her lips. She opened her mouth to me, and our mouths met and my tongue immediately sought hers.</p> <p>She felt me for the opening to her vagina, and I pushed a finger into her wetness while we kiss. Her body tingled with lust as I inserted another finger into her vagina. "Oh," she gasped. "Oh, yes!"</p> <p>I withdrew my fingers, and brought her hands to my front. She grabbed my penis and stroked me. "What do you have in mind?" she asked with a smile.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do, at first. "We'd better let you decide for yourself," I said.</p> <p>"But I haven'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
