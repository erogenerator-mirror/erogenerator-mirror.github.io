He said softly. "I'm taking you with me." He said, his head snapping up as he realized just where she was. "Not in your room though." He added in a serious tone. "It was just...I thought I'd get caught." The confusion that had begun to creep in was almost tangible, and she felt as if she was in a haze.</p> <p>"What, you didn't know what you were doing?" She questioned sarcastically as she made her way to the desk, her lips a touch dry. It took all of her strength to keep herself together.</p> <p>"Don't be a smartass!" He growled, his hand reaching for the door handle and turning it. "I've had my fun with you, but you'll have a lot worse luck with me."</p> <p>He was right. They were never friends anyway. She was just a student who'd gotten caught doing nothing productive. Well, except that her mind was working right now. The memories coming back flooded back again and she was in that fog...that fog. When she looked into the mirror she could make out the angry face behind it, but not with as much detail as she had in her mind. She wasn't sure how he saw it. She didn't see it but he had been able to look right through that fog of hers. His eyes were a shade of grey, but the iris and pupil was that of darkness and its eyes were dark and mysterious. "I know. I'm sorry." She lied. She hadn't known until now.</p> <p>"What time?" He asked in his soft voice, his hands tracing over her shoulder blades and down the back of her thighs.</p> <p>"My mother'll be home in 10 minutes." She said, her voice taking a moment to settle over in the fog. "How long do we have?"</p> <p>"5 more minutes, dear." He said, his hand caressing her face and down to her neck and then to her breast, making her breath hitch in her throat. The fingers of his right hand teased her, his thumb swirling over the nipple as his other hand cupped her left breast.</p> <p>"God yes." She murmured, leaning her face to his when he pulled her to him, his mouth forcing itself on hers again in the fog. The kiss was passionate, the heat of his body making her shiver.</p> <p>"Please." She said softly as his mouth left hers to trail a trail down her neck and shoulders. He traced her collar bone, the way he had the night before and she moaned softly. "Please," She moaned again, her hand reaching behind him to push him back so that she could slide her tongue into his mouth again.</p> <p>"Not yet." He said, his fingers digging into her ribs with desire. The thought of what he was going to do to her made her breath shudder and her hips push against his, the wetness between her legs becoming too much. He laughed and kissed her neck, the feel of her naked under his shirt against his skin made her tremble yet again. When he slid his hands into her shirt, pushing them over her head, he pulled her up against him. "I need to feel you again." He groaned in her ear as he took her in completely.</p> <p>"Just what would you do now?" she teased, her eyes flicking to watch him as he took his boxers off and slid his boxers across to the bed. He climbed over her, sliding his legs between hers, taking his hardness inside of her, making her whimper at the feel of his thickness penetrating her. He felt like he could go on forever as he rode her, the sound of their moans echoing through the door.</p> <p>He felt her hand grasp his cock and pull him back, her nails digging into his skin and making him cry out into her kiss. Their hands moved over each other as he pushed himself in and out of her, faster and faster. His eyes were on her breasts, but he couldn't take his eyes off her as she rocked her hips back to meet him.</p> <p>"Oh, god! Don't stop!" She gasped as they broke free from their kiss long enough to reach a peak.</p> <p>"You're going to kill me!" He gasped, feeling his balls tighten. He could see the look on her face as she screamed out as she came, so much pleasure that he was surprised how it was able to send him over the edge. He leaned forward, his lips claiming hers, his whole body shaking as he came, trying to catch his breath. She came too, but then he had her body still too, her arms pulling him down to her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." He murmured against her mouth, his fingers stroking her hair as she snuggled closer to him with her face against his chest.
