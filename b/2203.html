The look on her face was priceless. I think I felt a warm feeling rush through my body. My chest was heaving. Then looking over towards her, her eyes were so bright. I thought to myself how this would definitely drive her crazy, and I laughed lightly to myself.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go?" She asked with a bit of a teasing tone in hers.</p> <p>"You have no idea," I replied, moving my head back so our faces were close to each other, and I kissed her gently. Our lips locked right there, and for a few moments we had a truly magical moment together. I finally broke the passionate kiss, and looked at her as if asking for anything in particular. The look she made before she even spoke changed that to one of anticipation for what the next few seconds would lead back into some serious heartache.</p> <p>"I would love for us to go see something..." the words weren't needed to say where we headed.</p> <p>"I know, I know. And I promise I will let you have the keys once we take off." So, we made our way to the entrance, and she turned to put up her shoulder to a man, but he was already at the reception line. I had no idea if he would recognize me. The other people walking by didn't look at us. They just kept on walking, as well as looking in our direction out of the corner of their eyes. As the man passed, I saw him look at me, and then go back to his line. I guess we could have made a few points here that night with him, but it wasn't necessary. It wasn't at all necessary, in fact I was glad for it.</p> <p>She kissed me then, and I smiled at her, and the look she was giving me when she said it, told me she was ready. I saw her looking me up and down. I felt myself getting that little tingle that people have when they see you, because we looked so handsome right there. As we finished our walk, she walked towards me.</p> <p>"You are too gorgeous to let go, but if there is anything you could do, just let me know," I said as she approached and turned slightly towards me. We made eye contact, a little smile on her lips. I grabbed the keys just about the time they were heading off. I placed the key on the floor and said "we got here," and leaned towards her. Again, her lips were closed as they were, so I kissed her and moved my hand up the inside of her thigh, but this time, not on top, I took the key and slowly pulled her hand to my chest and placed it just below her breast. Her eyes were still closed, as if she could read my thoughts right there. When I made a point of doing this, this was exactly what I would say...if I could.</p> <p>When our lips finally parted, she smiled at me before kissing me again. We held hands now, and headed towards the elevator. As we got off, she was already walking me towards the front doors. While the doors were locked, we both pulled each other through it. Our hands kept wandering, exploring the deepest part of each other. Our lips never broke contact, but our whispers continued, telling each other how wonderful it was. Before we finally reached the door, I had her pressed firmly against it, and we were kissing again. This time there was some kind of power to our kiss. I think we felt it, and as my hands kept roaming her body, her body was responding to mine. Our tongues were exploring each other, and with the elevator door open, I could see that even her own hands were running through my hair, caressing my body lightly. I could feel her hands as she moved them over my body, occasionally sliding up, but never going near to my crotch. Her breathing got heavier, and I could see her nipples harden against my shirt. I also felt her chest, which really were, getting more in her stride by the minute. "Baby, I want to make something a little special for you." I whispered in my ear. Her eyes followed suit, as she saw my plan. I lifted both her hands, and put them on my shoulders.</p> <p>"I think you have one of those here, I'm going to make the most of it." I told her as I lowered her hands from my shoulders.</p> <p>"Mhm..." I whispered in her ear as I turned her around, and placed her on to my lap.</p> <p>"I think you just can't wait for this," I said with a smile, and lowered her thong to the ground. This time when I put my hand right on her pussy, I saw her wetness through the material. I started teasing her pussy, trying toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
