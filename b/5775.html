He rolled them over so they could lie side by side. "Let's get this over now. I can't do this with those thoughts flying through my head."</p> <p>She looked at him. "We can never do this again, can we?"</p> <p>He looked at her, "Just let me know, remember what happened last weekend?"</p> <p>"I got all wet again talking to your wife. I can't help it. I guess all I could think of was when our lips touched."</p> <p>"Why don't you just stop talking and just feel me." He told her.</p> <p>It was such a turn on feeling his hard cock between her legs. "I can't just leave you like this. You're too special for someone like me." He told her. In his mind, he was telling her not to cheat on him. He was sure that if he tried it, they would start feeling the truth. She had just started feeling guilty again and she was trying to convince himself to keep it. "I love you too much." He told her.</p> <p>"Can we be together forever? I need you in me."</p> <p>"Of course you don't need me. I'm so happy now. I need you in me."</p> <p>He reached out and took her hand and laid their on his rock hard cock.</p> <p>"You have no idea how much I mean that. "</p> <p>She stroked him and he thought she might take him in her mouth. God what a nice cock this. She wanted to have sex with him. To feel him cum into her mouth again. She wanted him buried deep inside her.</p> <p>They lay for a moment until she moved her hand from his cock, he pushed his hand under her and she got up on her knees and moved his hand back up her body to her pussy. He moved her body with his so that she came to his cock, then he put her leg up on his hip. He pushed his hard cock inside her and she let out a little moan. He pumped hard again and she wrapped her lovely body around his as far as he could take. He could feel the muscles of her pussy flexing around him, his balls tightened and he came deep into her again. "Thank you my love. Thank you. I feel as if you could have lived up to your promise and love."</p> <p>He loved it too. It took all his strength to hold her tight. When he came, he kept pumping all inside her. She held him tightly and let his cock soften inside her. "Just hold me and feel me again." She smiled feeling him inside her. He was still hard. But he was softer now.</p> <p>"That was fantastic. I just had to hold you again and it was incredible."</p> <p>They fell asleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>*******</p> <p>The sun made perfect shape in the sky, it was a warm day and they were still naked in bed. "Thank you, baby. You're the first person I have had a chance to be with."</p> <p>"Yes, and it was wonderful." She told him.</p> <p>"I can't wait to see you again." He told her and kissed her.</p> <p>It had been such a long time that it seemed like they had been together forever. It started out as a long distance relationship but after a while, it became as close as they had been together. She took his hand and they sat up for a second, looking into each others eyes. It was like old days.</p> <p>"I am so glad to see you, you look great."</p> <p>"So do you. Did you go back to your room or just lay back down?"</p> <p>"Do you mean stay there and watch that old porno I have been watching?" She asked.</p> <p>"You're kidding?"</p> <p>"Nope. Have you and I seen the same movie twice in a row?"</p> <p>He looked at her a bit. "No. No. We went back for dinner one time."</p> <p>"Oh. Did I catch you looking in a mirror?"</p> <p>"Yeah. It was amazing. Your eyes were so beautiful. They just looked beautiful to me."</p> <p>"I'm glad that I looked that good with my long hair down, it feels like a buzzer in my brain when I look at my hair. You really wore it like that didn't you?" He said his cock still semi hard and aching with the memory of her looking at him in a mirror.</p> <p>"Yes. It's my first time as much as I was with you."</p> <p>"Honey, can I ask you something?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I offended you but really, it was really great watching you do that. It was wonderful and you have a great bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
