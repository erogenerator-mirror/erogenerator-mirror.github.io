Before I could answer it I realized it was my husband's number.</p> <p>"Hey sweetheart?" I answered.</p> <p>"Honey, what's up?"</p> <p>"Just thinking about you."</p> <p>I couldn't help how this conversation had changed my mood. I felt happy for him, and was even happier, if somewhat sadder, than when I talked to him.</p> <p>"It's nice to hear your voice." he said. "Is there anything I can do for you?" he asked with a smile.</p> <p>"You do seem to get a kick out of having a man near you..."</p> <p>"And not knowing your man is nice, I like that."</p> <p>"Thanks, I love you, and I think we are going to have a pretty good time. What I'd really like though is to have you inside me, so you know how much I yearn to satisfy you tonight."</p> <p>"It's been a long day honey," and he handed me his phone.</p> <p>"Oh, so you want me to talk to some of my friends when we get home?" I asked. The thought of calling my friends was one thing, but being with him was another.</p> <p>"Not if I am going to be doing it. When we pick them up tomorrow morning, I'm going to have to go find someone to replace him, and we wouldn't have to wait for too long."</p> <p>That was a relief for me, since he knew how much I hated him being single. And I kind of missed that in our sex department. "Maybe you already told him about this," I said trying not to sound too disappointed.</p> <p>"No, he never mentioned it, but I know you would like to have me here tonight, so if it is what you want, that would be great. You know how much I love talking to you, and talking to you is so much better. I'm still a little horny, though."</p> <p>"That's ok, I have enough for you if you really want it tonight," I teased.</p> <p>"Of course I want it," he smiled. "You're still not ready to have me take your virginity yet, is that right?"</p> <p>"Oh," was all I could get out as I felt my stomach twist. "I wasn't ready to do anything tonight, at all."</p> <p>"I know, but you need to just stop asking so many of my friends out, for sure," he joked. "I'm sure I can help you out of that, honey."</p> <p>"Ok, just a little later, then," as I finished my coffee, thinking about how much life can change. He had made it clear that I could not be a virgin tonight. It was true, and I loved the way the night was over, but I was still aching for him and not just playing with my mind. Not only could he not wait until tomorrow, but I needed him to take off his pants because I was so nervous about the evening.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I put on my robe and went through the house to get my phone. I got the text message I had been expecting and immediately dialed Kevin's office number. After a second ring, a male voice on the other line let me know he was on the phone with someone.</p> <p>"Hey, babe. When can you get here?" I answered.</p> <p>"Well, well, we're probably on our way by now, but my friend just called to say she was just in town, with some friends. Her mom wouldn't let her come for a bit though, and I don't think she's even home until after seven."</p> <p>"Oh, you're sure her mom is home?" I inquired with a big smile on my face.</p> <p>"That's her mom that Kevin and I talked about earlier tonight. She's out of town for most of the weekend, so they'll be here any time now. I know all your rooms are probably locked up since you're staying over tonight, which is a good thing."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess not, but still, I could use your input?" I added. I was still a little worried because I had not had sex in about a month, and not once had he been in me up to his knees.</p> <p>"Yes, of course you can. And I need to check that everything is secure. Just tell meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
