Her body convulsed as her body shook, her legs pressing into my sides, making little squishy noises. I felt her vagina tense, gripping her cock, wanting release. So suddenly she started to cum.</p> <p>"Oh Jesus, oh Jesus!" I thought as she bucked and shook against my body. Her climax lasted a long time, lasting for nearly a moment - but it was so strong I was afraid she'd pass out if she kept coming. I held her tight, savoring the moment as she convulsed in my arms for several minutes, before she slowly came down.</p> <p>Mum had to push her thighs back against her tummy to keep her cock lodged between us, and I let go of her, pulling her with me. Eventually she came forward, resting against me, her cheek near mine. I was still lying with her, my arms around her shoulders, my own breathing still coming heavy. I could smell her perfume.</p> <p>Eventually she started to go. She straightened up.</p> <p>"Thank you, sweet Jesus!" she said in a whisper.</p> <p>"Oh, God," I said. "You're amazing."</p> <p>"So am I," she said, grinning, and giving my penis a gentle squeeze.</p> <p>"Come on," I said, and we got out of bed, and I helped her to her feet, and we kissed, and touched, and we fell onto the bed together, my hand in her pubic hair, my cock slipping between her legs.</p> <p>Mum's breathing stopped, and she kissed me. I cupped her face in my hands, feeling the softness of her cheeks, the texture of her lips as her lips parted. We kissed for a minute, then separated. She took her bra from her shirt, and we both stood up, undressing until we were down to just our boxers. Mum kissed me once more, letting me feel her breasts, and then she was kissing my hard cock in turn. She got on her hands and knees and sucked my cock, while my cock was buried in her mouth, sucking her clitoris and pussy.</p> <p>We kissed, then I lay down, and Mum sucked me, and we kissed, and we kissed, and we kissed. Finally, Mum said she wanted to eat my pussy. I thought I had been dreaming of this moment for years, and I could feel my heart speeding up, while my legs jerked a little, wanting to wrap around her body, but Mum made no move to get up, and she lay between my legs, leaning back on her elbows, her beautiful face in front of my cock, and her tongue licking me.</p> <p>"You're good," she said, and started to lick me. I had been in her mouth, but her hands were on my balls, and her mouth was sucking on my cock. She sucked my cock between her own lips, while she kept sucking me. "Oh yes, there, there," I whispered, and then I came, in her mouth, and she tasted me, which was beautiful. She swallowed it immediately, and then kissed it, as my cock softened and fell out of her hot mouth.</p> <p>When she had swallowed it, Mum got up and lay beside me. "Thank you," she said. "I needed that. You're amazing. If we ever do this, we'd better do it again."</p> <p>"We should try another position," I said.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said. "Don't you want to do it?"</p> <p>"Yes. It would be like when you're doing it like I was doing it - you know, like riding a bicycle?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said, smiling. "Yes, I do want to do it."</p> <p>Just the way she said it, I smiled, and we both drifted off, into a deep sleep. A week later, on a Sunday, I was standing up in the church, listening to Mum's father and his friends at the meeting. I was walking home with three friends, looking out the window as we spoke, and listening to her as she was with me.</p> <p>"Is there anyone?" Mum asked me, looking at me as she spoke.</p> <p>"Yes, but not as many people as I used to use to," I said. "I used to feel that a lot less." She nodded, smiling.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said. "That was such a nice way of thanking me."</p> <p>"Oh, good," I heard myself say. I was just about to do so, when Mom raised her arm and asked me to stop for a moment.</p> <p>"Oh," was all I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
