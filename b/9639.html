"But I am, and there will be plenty of fun, I promise."</p> <p>"Of course," he agreed, trying to keep the erection at bay, but there was no getting around. The rest of us, however, were looking forward to whatever it is that it must be that led to this; the only question was when.</p> <p>We were finally ready to go, though we had to get ready and find an extra room. We found a hotel in town we could easily afford from our previous day. It was actually a pretty typical hotel, with a pretty decent food, and just a couple, on the upper floor. It was also a decent sized room, with a couple of lounge chairs along one wall and a couch and a chair at the other end. We found an area just a little away from the main lobby where we had to wait for valet at the door, so we decided to go there. We could go out of town now, but we figured it was a good time to see what the other was doing.</p> <p>We knocked on the door and the other couple said it was open when we entered. He was dressed in jeans, but his shirt was unbuttoned in the front. He looked good and we both looked good as we came in. I could see he was a regular, though his shirt did not hide the fact he wasn't wearing a brassier, yet he had an equally good tan. We looked at the other couple as she was giving him an old fashion look. I can honestly say, I had never been more attracted to a man in my life, and it was a pretty good view.</p> <p>He wore a blue vest with the button on it undone, and a pair of old-looking jeans, with a button in front to show just his navel. He moved with a confidence that looked a bit like a well-built athlete. In short, he looked really good.</p> <p>We had our jackets off before I could even speak.</p> <p>"What do I look like?" I asked.</p> <p>"Pretty much the same as you, sweetie," she replied, sitting cross legged on the couch, holding on to his thigh with her hand.</p> <p>It was a nice look, and a nice-looking man was making an appearance. We knew that he was probably in his early forties but not yet 40ish. Probably in the gym. Maybe not. The sight of the man's cock probably was a turn-on. And I was sure having what I considered to be the same.</p> <p>"Like what you see?" he said, getting his bearings from his nearness, and taking in the sight.</p> <p>"Uh huh."</p> <p>He didn't seem as much nervousness as I was, as much as he was being able to do it. The other woman looked at him with a smile.</p> <p>"Like that?" he asked.</p> <p>"What do you think?" she replied.</p> <p>"What I've seen?"</p> <p>She looked at his crotch, looking for a bulge to show. There wasn't any visible bulge there, but they looked nice enough that the thought of it being a guy interested in being seen might get a little more interesting by now.</p> <p>I nodded as I stared, and she did the same. He didn't seem to care at all.</p> <p>"Come on in, honey."</p> <p>He followed his wife as I escorted her to the other side of the room.</p> <p>"Sit down here while we talk a few more things," he said as he closed the door, and turned to me. "It's been a while," he added with a grin.</p> <p>"I've heard a lot of things, but what does it really mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"It was nothing really," the man said, smiling back and looking at me.</p> <p>"But it has to be."</p> <p>"I know," he said, continuing to stare at me. "So, we're married now, right?"</p> <p>"It certainly hasn't been," I agreed, although I felt I already knew the answer.</p> <p>"But..." he said, looking back and forth from me to the window.</p> <p>"Oh, come on," I said. "Just tell me. I'm sure you wouldn't want to be separated from anyone. If our marriage is really nothing special, then we might even be friends."</p> <p>"Oh well, but I thought..." he began.</p> <p>"A couple of years ago..."</p> <p>"I know, but it's not that easy, huh, honey?"</p> <p>"Yeah," we both nodded, and I think in the dark the conversation was actually beginning to feel very interesting too.</p> <p>"So, there are some other interesting things that happen, that you're not even sure you're even supposed to knowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
