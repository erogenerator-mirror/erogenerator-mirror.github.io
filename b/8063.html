Then, out of the corner of my eye, I could see them both. It was crazy." Her face was red and she held my gaze for a moment before leaning forward and licking at the small bruise on my cheek.</p> <p>"I can feel their eyes on me and I can't stop it." I was almost panting and she leaned closer to give me a soft kiss.</p> <p>"When I walked out, I could see my mom in the picture. We were all smiling like maniacs; their heads were down and she was taking my hand. When I opened my eyes wide and saw what that was, I nearly tripped when I saw that I was wearing a pair of pink panties. When I saw mom and my father together, I almost went ballistic, but I had to take a breath so I didn't think about it."</p> <p>"You know it took longer than I could tell, but you really didn't notice. We were whispering in each other's ear at one point."</p> <p>"Oh," she said, her face starting to cloud up. "Yeah, maybe. I was looking for some reason that I missed while I was thinking about what I would look like with mom's new clothes on. I was so into what I was thinking about."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said as I put my hand on her head. "Just like I was into looking at my parents."</p> <p>"Well of course you didn't notice anything about what was happening at the moment."</p> <p>"Hah!" I rolled my eyes. "You're not a guy now; do you think I should have seen that before I went back inside?"</p> <p>"You couldn't have. We could have, and probably still'd be, but at the last second, it was like you were looking at me for free and I was looking at you for free. I mean, not that I needed to, but for the first time ever."</p> <p>"Yeah, a lot of times it wasn't like that, but I still felt a little weird." I put my hand softly on her head, pressing her mouth against me as if it was my penis. "Yeah, it wasn't like that when it happened; but when it happened again, it all got a little funny."</p> <p>"Uh-huh?" Jessica asked with a quizzical look.</p> <p>"Yeah, so maybe it was a little scary, but I've never cum like that before. Even when I cum, it's hard for me not to start thinking about the girls that I'm thinking about as well."</p> <p>"Well how does my brother act around you?"</p> <p>"So you know about the girls?"</p> <p>"Probably not."</p> <p>"Yeah but maybe she's going to be in to it when I'm done being that way and then it'll get kinda weird." Her face was flushed, which was nice. She was making me uncomfortable.</p> <p>"What are you doing? Why don't you talk to her about it?"</p> <p>"It's okay," I said soothingly. "Just remember, we're being silly and there's nobody else you're going to be thinking about when you're in charge."</p> <p>"That was kind of you I was thinking about; yeah, but not that."</p> <p>"Yeah. It wasn't you? I'm not saying that it was an accident; I just thought it might be important that we talk to someone about doing this. I told you that I've been taking it easy for a while and you were so nice to me. I'm not even sure if we were in love or just messing around... but I'm sure it's not going to be the worst thing to start with."</p> <p>"Well, you're not going to have to decide anything when it comes to that..."</p> <p>"So we'd better just go back to your house and discuss it. I'm not even sure when mom goes back inside?"</p> <p>"I guess we better go. I'll see you when you get home. You can talk to your mother in your room... but you can talk to me anywhere. I'm not really getting into this stuff about being your teacher, but you can't be too sure about all of the things that go on in that room in your head right now."</p> <p>She hugged me. "I love you," she said softly and then she leaned in. Her lips were sweet against my ear. "It just means that I need someone to talk to and you have to be careful around me."</p> <p>I wrapped my arm around her waist. "You know, if your parents ever find out that we're playing around, they'd probably kill meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
