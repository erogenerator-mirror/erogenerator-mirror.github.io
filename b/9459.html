"Maybe the next day."</p> <p>He walked back over and grabbed her by the hand. She followed him to the front door of her house and out into the cool night air. They walked hand in hand in their little world outside of her house. They stopped outside her bathroom. She took her hand from his. He reached toward her neck lightly and caressed the side of her mouth.</p> <p>"There," she said. "That's a gift you got yourself."</p> <p>She kissed him again, and then led him inside and out into the backyard. She closed the garage door and he walked into her garage. He walked around to her door. He unlocked her door, and walked inside. She followed him in and shut and locked the door. On the counter stood a large, white bag, in which were various colored pills they could have used.</p> <p>"You should be able to take these without too much trouble," she said with a smile. "I bought them out of the airport because they were still a bit rough, too."</p> <p>"Sure," he said.</p> <p>He laid the pills on the counter next to the bag, and reached into the bag to pull out different kinds of condoms. After he had gotten the condoms out, he looked over at her and sat on the couch. She sat down next to him. he turned and looked deep into her eyes.</p> <p>"This stuff's gonna keep you busy, right?" he asked.</p> <p>She nodded her head.</p> <p>"I really hope you have some condoms handy or just something like that on," he said, and sat back down in the couch. "So, what is all this about?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well, I bought a few new ones out on the airplane," she said. "They're for your first time," she said with a chuckle. "But I don't wear them anymore."</p> <p>"They're yours now, right?" he asked.</p> <p>She nodded her head in the affirmative.</p> <p>A mischievous smile formed on his lips. "Well, I was thinking, since we've already talked about it. Let's take this trip to the bathroom a lot this week so that it won't ruin our vacation too soon."</p> <p>"I love the bathroom," she said. I can't believe that she's going to use it when we're alone," she said.</p> <p>They both laughed.</p> <p>"How do you like the way we looked all night long?" she asked.</p> <p>She was really smiling now. She didn't say anything but it felt nice to have the confidence of a young woman.</p> <p>"I really did like it," he said. "It was nice to wake up to and be a woman of my own."</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"So, the next time you have sex with me is when I'll be taking showers and cleaning up after you," he said.</p> <p>She got that big, happy, wide-eyed look.</p> <p>"You don't worry about a thing. If that happens, we can always say no, or stop at any time and have sex now."</p> <p>"And where that goes?" she asked.</p> <p>"You know, on the one hand, you wouldn't understand," he said. "If someone tries doing things with you to make you orgasm, then you will probably never have the nerve to say stop at all."</p> <p>"Okay. So I guess that you can say no to 'all of that'," she said.</p> <p>"You mean it?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "If you don't want to do this, I won't stop. If you want to try something new, and I don't mind if you do, then you are fine with it."</p> <p>"Thanks," he said. "The plane ride was pretty wild. I can barely stand up."</p> <p>"I can't wait until we go," she said. "But right now I want you to do that thing that you did with me last night. I want you to just go to sleep. It'll only be a few minutes, and you can feel your pussy getting warm and tingly all over again with you excited."</p> <p>"I will," he said.</p> <p>They turned their attention back to the couch again. They both sat down.</p> <p>"Okay, how's it going?" she asked.</p> <p>"Fine," he said again.</p> <p>"Great," she said. "Now just go home."</p> <p>"No, I have a surprise for us," he said. "But I promise to do a really great job.
