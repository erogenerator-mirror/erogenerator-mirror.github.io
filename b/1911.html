I want you lying there, but I'm not gonna give you a rest until you cum. Are we clear to begin with?"</p> <p>She nodded nervously and then nodded up and back down as she felt her pussy tighten and her juices began to roll down her legs.</p> <p>"I don't have any lube, please I need you!" She begged him, her voice echoing in the corridor, "I want you to put it on, you need lube! Let me do the rest!"</p> <p>Husitating slightly, he turned around in her direction. She looked up at him and his eyes lit up when she saw the large jar that she had ordered in just before they had began their journey into the unknown to her sexual escapades. She had been watching him as she had done this for many a long time, and she was sure that he had read the signs written on her collar and would have gone into hiding as soon as they had crossed the threshold.</p> <p>"I'll make it worth your while!" She said simply, standing up and walking quickly across to her suitcase and retrieving the smallest of condoms and her anal sex toy. "Here are the instructions with the instructions." She reached underneath the desk for the bottle of lube, and began rubbing it all over her fingers, spreading the clear, lubricant over the toy, then slowly rubbing her finger along the outside, starting at the top, she continued spreading the gel down along her crack, her finger slipping in and out easily, then slowly and delicately gliding past the outer petals of her pussy, her other hand going down to her clit, her fingers dancing expertly.</p> <p>"Put your feet in the stirrups and roll them up. They should do the fucking most efficiently, not just as toys, but I can tell you that it will take a good 30 seconds for either one of you to reach orgasm. Once you do, you may just slide the toy in and out, but remember to slow down and come soon." She pulled her fingers into a quick, almost aching way, and she watched on with her heart thudding in her chest as the pink tip of the toy slipped in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>"Now hold still if you don't want me to do that or you want me to stop, but don't worry, I'll keep going until you can't help yourself anymore."</p> <p>She watched him as he placed the vibrating toy under the desk, taking her position in front of the desk, and he quickly climbed on, pressing his hard body against her as his hand came up, fingers digging deeply into her flesh, his mouth kissing her hard, demanding in the taste of her lips, the texture of the vibrator in his hand, the pressure of the vibrator in her ass. He had her, his body in hers, his tongue in her mouth, as she held her breath waiting for his release.</p> <p>He drove his hard, large, hard cock into her, his fingers in her ass, then out, then back in, moving faster now, driving his hard cock into both of her holes as she screamed with the intensity of their coupling.</p> <p>She shook with desire against the desk as her fingers danced over her clit and pussy as their bodies slapped together, almost a blur, as their orgasms exploded against each other and joined together as one, each coming from the same area, the one that had just been hers.</p> <p>After their sexual romp, he removed his fingers and gently pushed her to the carpeted floor. Looking up, she saw him lying on the carpeted floor in a puddle of sweat and cum, his cock standing tall and proud like iron. Reaching to it and giving him a kiss, she looked at his face and saw that he too was cum-stained in the sweat and cum on the floor and he was smiling at her.</p> <p>He had removed the vibrator from her pussy and was lying there waiting as she lay on the cum-covered floor beside him, her head resting on his chest, his cock nestled in her warm, damp furrow. She turned her head up as his arms moved around her.</p> <p>"I'm not kidding you about that, are you trying to tell me that I'm just going to have to do this every day for 5 or 6 weeks to keep you on track? Oh, and by the way- sorry about that one, but..."</p> <p>He interrupted her sentence as he grabbed the towel off the floor and dried himself. "No kidding, that was one of the most wonderful things to say. And it'll be another 10 to 12 years before either of us are able to look at or act like that." He paused and put down the towel. "It'll be hard for both of us to do. But when you get to the place where I come you're going toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
