I don't have to go to work today...it'll be after tomorrow. I promise."</p> <p>"I'm worried about you...about your work," she says. "I can think about it."</p> <p>I don't answer. I'm too wrapped up in whatever my mother wants to say about me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Alex," she says. "I haven't given much thought since last Christmas. Don't think I should be upset if I think about you a lot. It's obvious that you're working. It's just us, isn't it?"</p> <p>"I guess we could work something out. I've just been too busy working to do it right, but thanks."</p> <p>"It's true. I'm sorry we had to wait until then," she says.</p> <p>My mind begins to fill with images from last Christmas, of last Christmas, of Christmas Day. I can imagine what my mother is saying to me. "I really must look like a pervert, Alex," she says. "But I like you, and I just want to give you something to help you get over the bad thing that made me, as a child, so terrible."</p> <p>She pulls me closer, and her hand goes under my sweater and caresses my skin. "And I want you to know that I never liked my mother very much. But now that I think about it, maybe not as bad as you think. I'll bet you'd like to be able to touch me, right?" she asks, and I'm not sure how to answer, but the possibility scares me.</p> <p>"You're going to do it, sweetheart," she says. "I know you'll understand."</p> <p>I nod yes at the same time, and she removes her hand. "If it weren't you..." she says. "But I love feeling that way. It's so special, to feel it...in you, in you..." I reach out a small hand and hold the headboard of her bed, with her panties, but she doesn't let me touch them.</p> <p>"We'll try," she says. "I think that maybe you might not want to do something that you should not do. Maybe...something...that you think you'd really regret later."</p> <p>I nod. "I think I should do it," I say. "I think..." I'm trying to think of how to say it, but she just nods back. As I do, something seems to pop at me.</p> <p>"I've always wanted to try this," she says. "I really do. But I have to admit that it's really kind of scary, but..."</p> <p>She puts her finger on the top of my head and moves my mouth down. I'm starting to panic. I don't have to do this. It's my son I'm thinking about right now, and if there's anything I could do to make it right in my head, then I have to do it.</p> <p>"I just wanted you to know," she says.</p> <p>She presses my lips to hers for a few minutes, and then she pulls me onto the bed, our mouths pressing as one, our tongues exploring. In a few moments, I'm lying there, in my own bed, with my own mother, feeling her tongue, my mouth, her bare skin, every part of her.</p> <p>"Alex," she says. "Thank you," she says.</p> <p>"God, Alex," I hear her say. "I love you."</p> <p>"And I loved you, too," I say. "Just being with you in bed, as I do today."</p> <p>I slide a hand under her shirt and down to her shorts. She wriggles a little under my touch, but doesn't protest. I gently slide her shorts and boxers down, freeing her beautiful, slender legs and exposing her pussy for me.</p> <p>"Oh, Alex..." she says.</p> <p>I run several fingers over her wetness. She's so wet that the feeling just seems so good...so nice.</p> <p>"You have a lovely body, Mrs. L," I say. "It's not your fault that I'm the only one you have sex with today."</p> <p>"If I'd let you touch me," she says, and her body shudders as my hand begins to rub her clit. "You'd like that, wouldn't you?"</p> <p>"Uh-huh," I say. "You're my mother."</p> <p>"Then maybe you should come find me," she says. "Tell me when it's your turn."</p> <p>So that's what happened, really. As soon as she pulled meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
