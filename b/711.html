A shiver ran through her and she felt her pussy juices running down her leg. He rubbed it up and down, enjoying the heat of her. He teased the lips of her pussy for what felt like a lifetime. She let out a moan. He slid the two fingers into her as far as he could. She started to rock her hips and move her pussy to his thrusts. She felt the juices begin to flow and knew she was going to cum soon. She moaned and cried out as her orgasm gripped her body. She came and came.</p> <p>She felt him pull his fingers out of her pussy. "That was amazing."</p> <p>"You may come now."</p> <p>"Yes," she cried. As she felt his cock between her legs she opened and took it into her. She felt so good. The warmth of his cock hit her pussy and she moaned and writhed.</p> <p>She felt his body come up against hers. She arched her back and held his arms as she felt his cock penetrate her again. She moaned and moved to meet his thrust with her own.</p> <p>She moaned. "OH GOD. I need more of you."</p> <p>When he thrust inside her her words stopped as pleasure shot through her body. She felt like she could touch anything and she loved it. She had never felt such a feeling before. He slid out of her and rolled over onto his back.</p> <p>"I want to be inside you." He kissed her lightly, "I can't move."</p> <p>She smiled. "I know. I've been wanting this night for so long. Now I want you."</p> <p>He rolled over and put his arm around her. "I want you too." She wrapped her arms around his neck and leaned in to kiss him and explore his mouth. He pulled her face back up to kiss her again. She felt his body move against hers and she started to rub her body against him. He kissed her again, "I want us to do this every which way," he whispered in her ear and bit it.</p> <p>"I could do anything I want," she groaned and moved against him again.</p> <p>"You do whatever you want."</p> <p>"I have no limits. When I cum I can do whatever I want," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"I know," he whispered in her ear. They kissed again.</p> <p>When he kissed her shoulder he told her he had to get moving. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>She pulled her head back and looked at him. She felt so turned on that she thought of how many times they had fucked. She pulled his face down into her neck and gave him a low kiss. "I love you," she said in the tone that indicated her desire. She loved how he made her feel. Then she asked him to be the one to turn on her back.</p> <p>"Oh, I intend to." She heard him grunt.</p> <p>She loved feeling his hard dick against her. She got up on her hands and knees and he slid into her again. She sighed and moved her hips back every time he entered her.</p> <p>"Oh god that feels wonderful." He was pounding her and she liked that. She opened her eyes and looked out through the window, "Oh god that's so good."</p> <p>He moved with her, "Oh god, that's too much." His hands covered her back and his mouth covered her neck. Just as he was going to stop she felt his body tense. He stiffened and shot into her.</p> <p>"Oh god, it feels so good," that got her attention. He kept fucking her, enjoying the feelings of it. He had never felt anything like this. It wasn't long before he went soft, "I love you," he kissed her lightly.</p> <p>She smiled and kissed him again, "I love you." She was still holding her breasts as the sensations went into overdrive. Her nipples were hard and he slid his hand under them to feel how turned on it made her. She pushed her breasts together and loved making them like this. "What did you want me to do for you again?" he asked with a smile.</p> <p>She sighed and rolled over onto her hip. "I got a little more turned on."</p> <p>They kissed again and she felt his hands on her bottom. He reached under her hips and she felt something soft, like a tongue, slowly licking her. She sighed and felt herself become wet again. Her eyes closed and felt the delicious sensations in her body begin to get greater. "No," she whispered in his ear. She felt his tongue move to her clit again and that sent her into high speed wave.</p> <p>"OHâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
