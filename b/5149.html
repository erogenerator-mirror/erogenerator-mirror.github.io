Sarah hesitated, she hoped Jake wasn't disappointed with her. This guy was no better than John. He'd made her want him and there was no way he could ever satisfy her again!</p> <p>"Yes," he replied. A second time he repeated before Jake added, "But that's not what I meant." Sarah could only stare in disbelief that he was speaking to her like that.</p> <p>"What does my man want?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>"He wants to fuck you now," John answered, "and for you to suck his cock. That's all I ask right?"</p> <p>Sarah's mind was whirling and her heart was pounding through her chest! She was in the grips of something she had never experienced before and didn't expect. She also couldn't find her voice or control her trembling.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter what he wants Sarah," John explained, "You do what he asks. If you don't, he'll just put it in your mouth and then you'll be forced to do anything he tells you. How's that for a deal?"</p> <p>Sarah couldn't believe this guy made her feel that way. She'd never dreamed it possible.</p> <p>"I don't want to be your slave John! I think you're too good for me." Sarah blushed at what she said.</p> <p>Jake sat back down on the bench next to Sarah. He took off his shirt before sitting between Sarah's legs again. He wasn't as good as John but that couldn't be too bad, Sarah smiled at the thought of what he could do with John's cock.</p> <p>Jake's cock wasn't as big as John's but it was still a decent size. Much thicker than John's.</p> <p>John smiled at the thought of using another man in Sarah's bed. He knew he didn't have a lot of time. He smiled back and slid his shorts down, Sarah's eyes went wide and she smiled at him.</p> <p>She got her first real look at John's cock as he slid his shorts the rest of the way off. She tried to keep her eyes firmly shut but eventually it seemed like she was seeing her own reflection in the mirror.</p> <p>Sarah was in a state, her mind racing as the thoughts returned to her body. She hadn't felt this way in a long time but she couldn't stop herself. She reached out and wrapped her fingers around John's shaft and began to move her hand up and down as she watched him.</p> <p>"You're not going to be able to give me the orgasm I want," Sarah said. She watched in the mirror as John's cock got even harder. It was getting harder and harder to keep from throwing up.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and continued to stroke John. She could see her hand moving up and down faster as John moaned. His breathing increased and her own breath quickened.</p> <p>"Don't stop John," Sarah whispered, "It's okay."</p> <p>"Yes," John whispered as Sarah's hand sped up. The words were like a drug, taking over her body. She couldn't believe how good he felt, so warm, so manly.</p> <p>John lifted his head and looked at her.</p> <p>"Tell me when," he whispered. Sarah knew it was time to try to do what he wanted.</p> <p>"Whenever," Sarah said.</p> <p>Sarah's eyes darted from his face down to his hard cock. When John looked at her she knew she had made a mistake, she couldn't help it! She was about to be gang-banged by John. Sarah felt a rush as the alcohol flowed through her body, knowing it wasn't going to be unpleasant.</p> <p>John smiled before getting up and pulling her back into a more laid-back manner. Sarah's body was starting to tingle and her mind was spinning with the alcohol buzz. The idea of a guy taking her from behind was exciting!</p> <p>John's hand rested on Sarah's knee and moved slowly up her leg.</p> <p>"Will you let me... fuck you again?" John whispered.</p> <p>"Yes," Sarah sighed, not expecting an answer from this man who was making her so horny. "Anything you want."</p> <p>"Do you know how to use that tongue, Sarah? I bet you didn't expect to be used like that, did you?" John whispered. Sarah nodded. Again, John's hand slid up Sarah's thigh.</p> <p>"Tell me when you cum," John whispered again. Sarah couldn't believe she was willingly agreeing to being used for sex.</p> <p>"When," Sarah hesitated.</p> <p>"When, Sarah?" John asked, his voice a bit strained. John wasn't sure if he really wanted to give her what she wanted or if he was just a bit scared.
