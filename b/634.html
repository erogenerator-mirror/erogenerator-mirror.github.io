I said without emotion.</p> <p>"I had hopes that you might, too. I'd like to think we'd better be together if we ever get it right."</p> <p>"I'd like that. That's good to hear. Now, you've driven me away. Are you going to drive me back to the city after I leave?"</p> <p>I looked at the clock. "I should probably get going. If we don't, I'd like to see your place at least once before we leave."</p> <p>"It might be a nice change to stay here." She gave me a long look. "It takes a lot of courage for one as beautiful as you to risk being alone. And to be honest, I'm not sure I can ever do it without thinking it."</p> <p>"I don't think I have an answer as to why you haven't had some more fun with me lately."</p> <p>"I've been thinking more about it." She smiled softly. "Besides, your mom would have been a little disappointed if I hadn't had fun with you. And if your dad hadn't been so nice to the both of you while she was away, he would have been very happy for you. We could have stayed together all of the summer."</p> <p>"If I had one more choice here, I'd probably be happy to stay with you. And I really do think we'd have some fun here. Do you think we could do it?"</p> <p>"Well, I kind of doubt you have the energy to do it alone. But if we're going to do it, I'm sure we could."</p> <p>In the shower we washed each other. I loved the feel of her body under the soap and the feel of her hands on my body. And I really could feel myself getting hard and growing. We soaped and washed each other and we both started to reach for each other and I stopped her. "I really should probably get going again. You're getting all the action you've wanted, my sweetie."</p> <p>She looked at me and laughed. "Don't worry, I'll see you after I get myself together and then I'll be gone right away."</p> <p>"OK." I grabbed a towel and put it around me and then we were out the door.</p> <p>We drove around for a few minutes and she stopped at the motel and checked in while I got myself a room. The room had a king-sized bed and it didn't take me long to fall asleep. When I woke up, it was almost one in the afternoon. A lot of the afternoon was spent talking and planning ahead and I knew it wouldn't be very long.</p> <p>After putting the room card in the lock, I started to put the lights out when I remembered the movie. "No, that isn't necessary. The movie is for when I get back to the city and I'd like to get it back to you. I'm sorry for the evening, but I have to go. We should get going. Are you going to stay?"</p> <p>"Of course I will. I'd like to see the movie when we get back." I turned on the light and we walked to the door to the front door.</p> <p>"You've got to be quiet." I was in a mood after the previous night with the last person I'd talked to when I found out Mom had been gone a lot of the night before.</p> <p>"It's probably nothing. Come back later." I pulled the door closed and I headed back to the car.</p> <p>When we got back to the house, I put the lights back on and turned off the lights. I pulled into the garage and walked over to the truck and grabbed the spare key and walked over to my car.</p> <p>"I'm going to take a shower." I told the cab driver.</p> <p>"You're right. We can do that later." He agreed and turned to drive off.</p> <p>I reached under the hood and got out of under clothes and went to the living room and took out the disc with the name of the movie still on and put the disc in the player and put the disc in the player, turning on the TV. "I'm going to watch and when you get done showering I'll join you there."</p> <p>We watched the movie about a half hour, before I went into the shower and I put the shower wand on it and turned on the water.</p> <p>When the water was running, I got out and stepped under and I turned it off. My erection was still tenting in the front of my pants as I took it out and held it against my side and rubbed up and down over the head. There was a softness in the feeling that I hadn't felt for a long time.
