They both had a bit more to say than I could, so there would be fewer secrets to keep. He was right about something, however, they did need to get some of it done. He knew that a "yes" would not come easily from a sub, and he had taken his "yes" quite a bit too far. His face was flushed and his body language showed it.</p> <p>"What are you going to have for me today?" He asked with a voice that begged me to comply.</p> <p>"Whatever you want, Sir," and just as quick, he pulled out my panties as I stood up to leave the bathroom. They were soaked. When he opened me he found that I was completely dry in places as well, so he cleaned them very thoroughly and gave both pairs equal attention and devotion. He had come to a decision, it seemed, that I was in too much need of a good piss. His fingers worked their way inside of me and soon I was shuddering, a climax coming on all of the time. As I started to cum, he pulled me close and kissed me, tasting a bit of my own juices on his lips which he found very exciting. After a brief rest, I was led back to the dungeon.</p> <p>It had looked nice. Now there were no restrictions and no surprises. It was still quite warm, even a bit cooler outside as I went into the main room. I did not really know how I felt about it. It was nice, but something was missing. We walked through the large, double bed, not bothering to change. The room was a mess, from all the dirty clothing and dirty clothes, which I would never have imagined in a room full of naked, aroused males. As we entered the room, a small table with three pieces of furniture had been added, including an electrician, a chef and the occasional waitress (my new Master knew what they meant), all of these items could be arranged anywhere in the dungeon. He had been correct again, most of them. We left the table and walked towards the large, circular bed. He had done a good job, I was glad.</p> <p>He went to the table and helped me to straddle the table top. I sat down and he positioned me over the table top. I had just the feeling that he was going to go for the kill, as he removed his clothing, placed his feet together and then positioned himself between my thighs. He kissed me, my neck and along my breasts. I could feel his manhood, already wet with my juices, pressed against my ass as he entered both me and the table. He didn't need to guide it, he knew how to make a woman react to this kind of thing. I could feel my breasts rising and falling with each slow thrust of his pelvis. He was very aroused, it was easy for me to tell. I had been on the edge of coming quite a lot the first time he entered me, but I just kept my focus on that feeling of satisfaction.</p> <p>His thrusts were now just a little faster and a little more vigorous. He was now in control of himself and he wanted me to be able to take him. My pussy was getting wetter and wetter when he said,</p> <p>"You can't come yet, you're not finished here."</p> <p>I nodded and began a bit of pleading as I begged in his ear. I could feel my cunt getting hot and it got even tighter around him after a good bit of teasing. I was almost there when he said,</p> <p>"Are you ready to come, slut?"</p> <p>"Please, Sir, please let me come, I can't take much more, please."</p> <p>"Not yet, that is my job. That's about all I will give you. You'll find what I'm after."</p> <p>He started pumping harder and faster. I couldn't focus on anything and I could feel my pussy tightening and releasing. I knew I was coming soon (maybe not as soon as I thought it would, I don't know). My Master was thrusting into me with a fury and his pelvis shook as he rammed it home. His balls were swinging around and bouncing against his thighs as he was coming. The thrusting continued. I was coming just as I heard him say,</p> <p>"You are going to be the entertainment nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
