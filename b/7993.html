My eyes were still locked onto the sight of my own flesh, watching it stretch and expand with each pulse as I filled her, felt her wetness and heat envelope it, saw my juices drip over my fingertips. She was so wet, warm and wet, and so tight. My own legs trembled, my feet slipped into the water beside her. My mind went wild with the memory, with just the right touch, and I almost forgot about the other things in my mind. All of them. What more should I want, what more could I want...</p> <p>I felt the other sensations, the wetness that I had come to love, the soft press and stroke of her body, and the tightness of those two tunnels that had been holding me back. And the way her body began to contract, flex, and relax; the way the pressure built up in her body, in her sex as I felt her shudder with it.

My body went through the same cycle of pleasure again and again and again, each time my strokes grew longer, more deep and deeper, as we made the pleasure known as our hips began to grind together, our moans, and of our mutual cries of pleasure. Her hands clamped down on my waist and began to thrust me hard into her even though there was no reason to hold back, our own groans and cries of pleasure rising in tempo as we came, then retreating again with the sound of the storm breaking over our own cries as our bodies clenched together, in mutual climax, and in the still nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
