We sat in the family room and talked about work, and about my plans to get a job where I'd actually be able to see. I told Jenny that I'm hoping that she and Mary would be OK with the idea, but not the part as "a new mom, one no one is ready to start." I told Jenny that I was in this for myself and wouldn't pressure her into something that she couldn't even imagine. She said she'd be honored, and that she hoped to get her license and I told her that would happen as well. So, I left her hanging and I was glad that she came to me as Mary. I was glad that she was a happy and well-adjusted 18-year-old woman, but also glad that no matter what I was doing for her, her life might be much better when she saw that I felt the same way about her.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I was so happy to be back home...it had been, by the way, the happiest weekend of my life.</p> <p>I'd called both her parents, Mary and Mary's mother, and found a call waiting for them on the answering machine. The first thing the girls noticed was when they answered, they were both still in tears! Both looked up at Mary and Mary's mom, and the look on their faces was priceless. They both started and then Mary's mom said, "What's the matter honey, what's happening?" and Mary's mom started to cry too. Mary's mom said, "C'mon dad, she cried. We really can't have any more crying!"</p> <p>I could tell that she was crying and I gave her a reassuring look and said, "Mom, don't cry. It's Ok. We understand."</p> <p>So Mary's mother said, "Dad, can I get a hug?"</p> <p>As she got up to go into the kitchen she said with a huge smile, "Well, honey, it's time I hugged you!"</p> <p>I started to say something else, but she interrupted me saying, "C'mon, dad, go in there and see for yourself."</p> <p>I got in front of her and said in a voice that seemed like it came out half-stern, I said, "Mom, I'd really like to hug you too, but I just hope that you're OK with it."</p> <p>"Sure, honey, any minute now." she said and smiled. I was just glad that I was on my own...I've been a good boy all my life.</p> <p>After Mary's mom hugged me, she said, "C'mon Dad, I'll take care of you." They hugged each other hard again, but this time, the hugging was more intense. We were all crying, it was evident, because we were both happy to have the same person crying all by ourselves and it was an incredible feeling. Then, we all headed back to my apartment.</p> <p>When we got there, mom gave me a long and wonderful kiss and said that she'd feel better if I kissed and made love to her like the other women did. I was surprised, but I knew that it would take all my self-control not to kiss and make love to her!</p> <p>I was very happy to be allowed to make out with my mother for the first time...it was something out of my sexual fantasy. I was also thrilled that she really wanted something in return for letting me make love to her. This was just a first for me...I knew that kissing and making love were a totally new experience for her, and being in the same room with her...I had to take things slow. I said that, as I didn't like to rush things.</p> <p>When Mom said that, I had a feeling that she meant it and she really wasn't upset at all that I kissed her like that or maybe she just wanted me to. She was kind, and she hugged me back very hard and said, "Oh, dad, don't go ahead. It's OK." And, she kissed my cheek. Mom was still crying. After a few moments, she said, "Dad, I love you, but I'm a little scared." So, I started to kiss her again, and in a way, I felt that I'd just gotten the woman I loved back over in her arms. She put her arms around me and began to make out with me for the first time ever!</p> <p>As I kissed her I could hardly believe what was happening to her. She was making out with someone else, who had been so very obviously attracted to her. There was just something about this that made me really happy, but I worried about the emotional aspect of it. As I looked at her face, as she was crying, then I looked into her eyes and I couldn't believe it! Her tears were so dark they looked like they wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
