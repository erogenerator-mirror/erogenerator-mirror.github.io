"It's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard so much about you."</p> <p>I knew I was giving her an earful because of the way I felt about her when I first laid eyes on her. We worked together at the office and often visited with her after I ran errands for the three of us. I knew that she was a very attractive secretary whom I could only image as a very sexy young lady. And I was quite familiar with the term "young lady" ... it seems we had some rather interesting conversations at the office. I think she thought I was a beautiful young lady.</p> <p>We spoke of our growing friendship. We had already established that we liked each other as we would with any other young person. So I didn't want to make things awkward for her. If we continued with our friendship there was going to be no misunderstandings, no lies, no excuses, and no expectations that any of our sexual activities would ever stop, even though our relationship might have changed slightly in the past. I wanted to continue our relationship as we would now be. We continued to talk about our lives as friends.</p> <p>When we were home alone, I'd sit at my computer and look at a story I was reading. But there was nothing in it that I wanted to read. I didn't know what I was supposed to read and I was in no real mood for it ... and so I sat there watching the story on the computer.</p> <p>As soon as I saw her enter my office she stopped and looked at me with longing. My heart raced at the sound of her voice. I have to admit that this really felt good to her, even for me. I had to have her. In my mind, I saw it as a very mature and erotic, sexy lady as she entered my office to see if I could keep her for myself. I needed to know more about her, so, with all of my will power, I walked over to her and sat myself on the couch. I looked at her and took her hands into my hands feeling the shape of her fingers as they extended from my hands. She was beautiful.</p> <p>She saw my lust for her and smiled. "You really are very beautiful, Michael. I know you are attracted to me ... and this is the closest I have come to you being in your office."</p> <p>"No, no," I said softly. "Not at all. I've just found that I am attracted to you ... much more." I said. "I'm really attracted to you."</p> <p>She turned a bright blond shade of red which made her eyes sparkle. I loved it ... it was a natural shade of red to her. I liked it even more than hers. It was the first time she was a shade more red. It just so happened that our paths were crossing and our paths had been crossed before. The feeling was mutual and so I decided to make the next step.</p> <p>I was hoping she would understand what I was thinking, so I got up and walked back to the bedroom. It was time for whatever came next. She lay back on the bed, looking up at me, as I took off my t-shirt and shorts. It was my turn to sit at her feet. I watched the sensual site of her lovely body as my hands caressed her thighs above her knees. We had talked before about how much I liked to kiss her and be in her personal space. As I kissed her, I felt her legs spread open so I could kiss her bare thighs. I continued to kiss her legs and slowly worked my way around them feeling her skin against me. She felt lovely. I moved to her feet then kissed her again as I sat back on the bed. I kissed her ankles and the insides of her thighs and then her sex, slowly working upwards to a beautiful triangle of brown brown hair. I felt her legs part naturally to allow me to slip beneath them and slide my tongue between them. Her body shivered as I kissed up her legs and I moved up again so her sex was available to my tongue. She was already very wet but I kissed it to get her wet. I could feel her labia being parted by her fingers as if they belonged to someone else. As I ran my tongue up her slit, I began to suck her lips while her pelvis began to raise against my mouth. I felt her legs become weak at the knees. I moved down to take a breast into my mouth and began to flick my tongue on her nipples before sucking them for extra lubrication.</p> <p>I pulled her closer to me so I could feel her warm breasts and her nipples against the back of my mouth, as I sucked and bit the flesh of her breast until her fingers reached down to the back of my hair and pulled my head hard into her. I felt her body tighten up more as a response of her own to my tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
