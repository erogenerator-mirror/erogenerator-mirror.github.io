I replied, trying to be brave.</p> <p>In my bedroom I heard my bedroom door close. What would I tell my husband? I decided to go through my closet and see what all I had. Everything. I took a deep breath and opened the bottom drawer of my night stand and found a pair of pink panties. And then on top of that box contained my bra. The label said, "Gifts Me", and I put both of them on. They fit perfectly. The front panel did not have any padding, and in the front was nothing but a plain white t-shirt. What was I thinking?</p> <p>The bra cups were too big. I had to go without one. It felt so nice and big on me and it had been far too long! I looked at myself in the mirror again and I could see I was still trying to decide what to wear. I quickly grabbed my clothes and headed into the bathroom. The cold shower felt good on my skin. I stepped down into the tub and let the jets massage me. It felt so nice. I just let it. I didn't care what anyone else thought. It made me feel sexy. I looked at myself in the mirror again and again.</p> <p>It felt so nice. My breasts were so firm and my tits were slightly bigger than I thought they were. And it felt very nice to be able to move a little. You know that's a feeling just like swimming. The heat of the water felt good on my skin. My whole body tingled. I just sat back and let it. It felt good. I looked at myself again in the mirror. I thought about my husband. He would see everything. He was going to notice everything I'm wearing. I could picture the look on his face when I bent over to put the outfit on. I could feel his eyes looking at me when I wore my shirt. He would feel the weight of my body in his hands, and he would like to have all of me.</p> <p>I decided that I may as well go shopping again. I really needed my own place. This would feel so good, and that was the only way we would have the opportunity to have that. So I dressed in a white blouse and a pink sweater. All of my clothes felt so nice and comfortable to be dressed. I wore my hair long and straight, and some white sneakers.</p> <p>I left my room in little time. I walked to the door and unlocked it and went in. I stopped and looked around. There were no signs of my husband. I walked down the hall to a door and knocked. It opened automatically and there he was standing in a living room. He looked up at me, and he looked me over from the side. He said something to me, and I heard a slight chuckle behind me. He was in his late forties or early fifties. He was in a sporty sort of way. I noticed that my long blond hair was falling across his face, and he was rubbing a hand against it. I could see he wasn't wearing a hat.</p> <p>He turned and looked into my eyes as he spoke. "Nice outfit, baby," he said, and with that a big smile spread across my face and a big hardon came into view. I turned to meet him. Our eyes met and this time I felt his hardon through his pants. I pushed him down and went to my feet and stood in front of him. I dropped my shirt and bra, giving him a chance to look at my breasts and my nipples. He dropped his pants, and I was completely naked. His dick was sticking straight out, throbbing, almost as big as mine. After I got naked, I just stood there, looking him in the eye with a grin.</p> <p>He looked at my long tan chest, and I felt his eyes get big when they got to my breasts. I was pretty sure he could see the hard on he'd make. I looked down at it, and I saw it was swollen. I'm sure it was very hard.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I take these off?" I said.</p> <p>"Why, no," he said. He reached down and helped himself up, and I followed his lead. I pushed his chair away and sat down. I pulled on my socks, and got out of the dress shoes and socks in the same manner. I looked into his eyes again as I slid them off and then back to my dress shoes. I did this again, taking them off first.</p> <p>"Don't you look better without the shoes?" I said suddenly, knowing what he meant.</p> <p>He did look pretty good to me, as I knew it. My legs were still a little shaky.
