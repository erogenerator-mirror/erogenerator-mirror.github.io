"I wish I'd known how much you wanted a job, I could talk you into doing it." She winked. "Not to tell you, but I'm still pissed at you about that."</p> <p>"It wasn't that bad to make." Daniel shrugged. "It was just...awful."</p> <p>"Really? Well it's worth it after..." She trailed off, unsure how to finish. Daniel just smiled again.</p> <p>"I'm not gonna fuck up my chances of going to school with you."</p> <p>"Oh? Really, where is that?"</p> <p>"You want me to be your boyfriend?"</p> <p>Dani rolled her eyes. She really didn't know what to think about that.</p> <p>"What? You want me to be your boyfriend? Why on earth would I do that?"</p> <p>Daniel shook his head, wondering what she'd do if just saying that made her angry all over again. She would have her eyes closed, would tell him to just say yes and everything would be ok. "I could still be your boyfriend."</p> <p>She laughed. "You're not so bad at that. Not as bad as you'll be on your own. I mean, I'm a guy, so I'm not like you."</p> <p>Daniel's heart sank.</p> <p>"You're pretty cute when you're upset." Daniel smiled and kissed her. "I mean, you're my girlfriend and all that, but I'm still really fucking pissed at you."</p> <p>She smiled again, "So you're gonna make me your boyfriend? That's more like it. Well...I've thought about that a lot. I figure I might as well give them a good push to get a little bigger." She smiled up at him. "It's so much more fun to do that than just wait."</p> <p>"I'm guessing you do a lot of thinking." Daniel grinned at her.</p> <p>"I'm guessing so far."</p> <p>"Well, are you gonna tell me or not." He nodded.</p> <p>"You know, I might be tempted to tell you." She grinned back at him. "But if that goes too far, I need him too so we can be even." She laughed at her own thoughts. "No, that's okay. I'm a girl."</p> <p>Daniel's heart nearly burst. He was so incredibly excited about it and she still stood there being so cute. His mouth started working but he kept it covered. "Not a chance."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Of course." He nodded. He knew why she liked him. For a moment he couldn't believe himself. 'Wow'. "But tell me, then."</p> <p>"It's hard to talk back to you." She smiled again and stood up. "I have a boyfriend, it's so hot to see it."</p> <p>"Oh, I think he likes you."</p> <p>"Well, yeah I do. It's cool knowing it turns you on." She blushed slightly.</p> <p>"I think there's something else there." Daniel shrugged.</p> <p>"What's that?" She grinned at him, happy that he had brought that along.</p> <p>"You wanna take my girlfriend up to the dorm tonight for cocktails?"</p> <p>"I'm not that desperate to go down on her." She rolled her eyes. "You'd rather not waste my time?"</p> <p>"It depends." Daniel's smile disappeared.</p> <p>"I don't wanna spend the night with her either." He grinned.</p> <p>"But I'd love to go back to her." He joked.</p> <p>She nodded. "Okay, no problem. She's not your girlfriend."</p> <p>He sighed. "I guess I'm just so nervous." He had almost forgotten who she was. "So do I start this thing off?"</p> <p>She nodded. "That way you can spend time with her."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure I'll do that." He took her hand in his. "And I'm sure she'll do the same." He grinned at the idea and got back on his feet. "She said that she had a surprise for you before you were allowed to go."</p> <p>"Oh yeah." She grinned. "There's some pretty incredible things I could do with my own hands right now." She chuckled and made an annoyed face. "See?"</p> <p>Daniel shrugged and ran a hand gently through her hair. "There's nothing to be concerned about."</p> <p>"Okay, just a little worried." Danielle's heart raced. She loved him. She loved his body. This was their chance. For as long as she could remember, her heart had been in his lap. Now it was in hers.
