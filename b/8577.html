I began, licking the tip, flicking the slit as if it were a lollipop. It was the best tip of the lollipop.</p> <p>"Fuck! It's such a nasty thing! I'm gonna fucking cum!"</p> <p>"Cum! Just fucking cum!" I responded. I then leaned in and took the head in my mouth.</p> <p>"No! Not there! Let me cum in your hand!" I begged.</p> <p>"I don't care, get that fat cock out for the count! Let me see what it feels like to have cum shooting in your wet pussy! Yeah! Feel it! Feel it goin' in your hand! Feel it! CUM! CUM!"</p> <p>After I ejaculated, I leaned back, and just lay on top of my man, kissing him, caressing his face, his chest, and finally reaching down, squeezing as much of his cum as I could on my hand. He put one leg on the couch, and the other on the floor, resting, and it was obvious what he had been thinking.</p> <p>He finally got up, got dressed, and went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. The table was full of nothing but food and drink, as we were not eating, we were just sitting there, just watching TV and talking. I sat there while he opened some food and made his coffee, took it into the living room and we sat there again.</p> <p>He was still drinking his coffee when I felt him stir.</p> <p>"That was so fucking hot, you really just sat up there, you were just acting."</p> <p>"It was hot and sexy, and I loved it. Do you mind if I watch it while I do? I want you to see how much of a slut I have become, when I'm alone at home."</p> <p>"Fuck it, you want me to watch, or would you rather we just fuck for a while now! Besides, you can watch what I do right now if you want to, or you can watch it while we make love. Do you want me to watch you, and you can see how I act?"</p> <p>He smiled as he said those words, so sweetly, that it made me feel so hot inside, I wanted him to do that for him, just for me, right there. I sat there watching him sip his coffee slowly before he finally looked up at me, smiled, stood, pulled off his shirt, and tossed it on the back of the couch, with his socks followed shortly thereafter. He sat down and got a drink, then sat it before me. I sat there with him looking at me, wondering what he had in store, if I would ever come out to his house again. I wasn't really sure whether I would be free for sex, with a man, or not, but knowing that I would anyway, would feel as if I was going to be alone to fuck it. I wasn't thinking, I was just drinking so sweetly, but with passion too. I smiled again, and just watched him.</p> <p>I don't really know how long it went on, I thought I was watching one of my favorite shows, but then he got up, came back into the room, sat down, and crossed his legs. I wondered what was going on too, and he looked at me, smiled, and said, "You're my little nympho!"</p> <p>He was such a nice guy. He could so easily get his little prick away, if he wanted to. I just smiled, not knowing what was next.</p> <p>"It's ok. I love watching you. I love to watch you masturbate, even when you're not being a man."</p> <p>He got down as he sat on the floor next to me, and put his hand down my shorts. I felt his hand go under my shorts, into my underwear. I started to pull them off slowly and told him that he might make me cum. He started to rub my cock while he said that, and I started to reach down and put one in my fingers, when he lifted his head and looked at me, smiling.</p> <p>"I really want to see you, make love with two men at once, do you think you will be able to, do you think you can make it happen?"</p> <p>What else could I say? I knew I was going to be fucking him for quite some time, watching some porn show, as I had this weekend with Jim that I would never do, but now that seemed to be the only thing I could do at this point.</p> <p>"Will you do it for me? Make me cum! I need to feel your body against me, feel you touching me."</p> <p>He looked at me and smiled, as if to beg me toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
