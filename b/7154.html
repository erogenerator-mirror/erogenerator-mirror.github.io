They found some food in an old building and took it to one of the larger buildings to eat, then left them to rest. The woman was still alive, but was sleeping. One of the guards opened a window to the sun. They took another window on the roof. A little later the woman's hand was touching his head. He looked over and saw that it was covered in blood. He moved to look again and saw that the man that had just shot the woman was dead, so he moved back to the window and looked for more women who were alive. As they began to gather more of the bodies back into the buildings, an older man came out. He had the same face as the man in front of him. He was younger than they had been. As he approached the two men, he recognized him. The man was still talking to the woman that was still trying to breathe.</p> <p>He reached them and asked, "Who did this to you?"</p> <p>The girl who had been standing next to the man's body said, "The woman was a friend of my father. We were visiting my sister a few months ago and had gotten a visitor for the first time that morning, and she said that my father would be in his room, if he would like to meet me."</p> <p>The man replied with, "Well, if you want to see him, you can. Have a good flight and meet me in the conference room. We should be heading back soon."</p> <p>After they were alone, the man looked back at the woman lying on the table. "She is still alive. As it turns out, my father isn't really dead. I know it is your father. It doesn't take much for the police to find this place, and I don't understand why anybody would have come to do this."</p> <p>The man looked back to the woman on the table, and then asked, "What happened with the woman? You know how the men were getting along, didn't she bring her mother down to the hospital?"</p> <p>"Oh, you could say that. One of the people who did this to her, was my aunt. She was a beautiful young girl, one of my closest friends. She worked for a firm in the city where we lived, and her mother had died when she was ten years old, but I don't know what happened to her. It is a crime that she was never supposed to have done in this town." The man explained.</p> <p>The woman was surprised and surprised and then asked, "When they shot her, who were the people involved?"</p> <p>The man smiled, and responded, "Aunt Julia, we met some times here. My wife was a girl whose daughter she had always liked, even though we were both from different generations. Our friends at the law firm were there too after we were caught and told me she was going to have something on today. We were friends with her sister that the authorities said you were not, so we were able to stop all of them before any more of her friends were harmed. She was taken away and left alone there by one of Mr. Jenkins' men." The man added. The man then turned to the woman, and finished his explanation.</p> <p>The girl was lying on the table in the middle of the room, and asked, "When did you see my father?"</p> <p>"Yesterday. I called, told you that I was here and that he was here. You were supposed to meet me, but the people called for you early this morning. We had to take your mother away and get back to the airport." the man responded.</p> <p>The man looked at the man and shook his head. Then he looked at the man and asked with a smile, "Are you sure that is what you want to do, I mean, you know I have no right to be here and about this, when the people were looking for you...?"</p> <p>The man said, "Don't worry the man. All you do is take out some of his people and kill them. If you can kill someone without killing your own man, well, now's the time. The people that I mentioned before are old and fat, so they will probably never make it back to someplace safe." he explained.</p> <p>The man and the man looked at each other again. The woman saw the men look at her and then back to her. Her face was still looking from the man, who was now looking into the eyes of the man she was looking at. The man smiled at the man again, as though he were still talking to him. They returned to the table and sat down. They ate, and they talked for hoursâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
