You'll enjoy what we have planned."</p> <p>They walked to the elevator. Jack couldn't help the little giggle he could have. He had no idea that she had a boyfriend. And just as well.</p> <p>"Well I gotta go shower, or I'll miss it."</p> <p>"What! And where are you going?"</p> <p>"I gotta head to the airport."</p> <p>"How is it that you think you are going to let me skip, then let me walk you through it like a baby that has seen a ghost? Just because you're not so tough and so smart?"</p> <p>"Oh. No. Nothing like that."</p> <p>When they got to the terminal Jack's plane was waiting in the hangar with a very large banner on it that read "WE WILL BE BOTH!". "Good night my handsome stud." she said and her lips twitched. Her lips twitched again.</p> <p>When Jack got into the plane he was thinking about all the wonderful events in Jamaica with his beautiful sister, his sweet sister and his beautiful cousin. He was looking forward to the next flight trip.</p> <p>The flight to the island was about an hour long. It was another long flight that included several stops and all the stops. The trip ended well and they went back to the resort. It was dark outside. The resort was only about 200 kms and was very inviting that night. After they parked and got out to the parking place, the two were talking in hushed tones as they walked up to the entrance, a small, small bar with a table to one side. The room wasn't large enough for that.</p> <p>They ordered drinks, talked a lot, and drank to the music of the band. They had some good laughs and a lot of giggling over a few drinks. The room was very well kept.</p> <p>"What was that all about?" Jack asked as the laughter subsided.</p> <p>"That was your dance?"</p> <p>"Well I wanted to go dancing with you and that went better than dancing with other guys."</p> <p>"So we are going out that night, right?"</p> <p>"I had a thought earlier about what you might want to do for yourself," she said leaning over and smiling at Jack. Jack was speechless.</p> <p>"And what might that be?"</p> <p>"Well, I might have you come out to the bar when it gets dark and the next song is going to stop. I might just go up to your room and bring you back to the bathroom as you go to bed and we will all do what ever it is. But do you think this could work?"</p> <p>"What?" Jack said again. He was stunned.</p> <p>"If we stay together, if Jack is there with you, then that would be our agreement," she said.</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"I will have you and Jack come out to your room. Or let him come out of the bathroom in a little robe for us. I may even take him to our room to see what is happening."</p> <p>"But I don't know. I don't know, so..."</p> <p>"But it might work for me as well, so we can have sex."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I think it would enhance your sex life."</p> <p>"But I won't be able to have sex with another guy."</p> <p>"Jack I can do everything else."</p> <p>"No. No you can't."</p> <p>Jack looked at her. He did like her, she did like everything she did. He decided to ask her what she was thinking.</p> <p>"OK. OK."</p> <p>At the bar Jack said, "She, she, how would you like to go out to the water."</p> <p>The young female waiter approached the table. Jack smiled.</p> <p>"So it hasn't got dark yet, you are staying in Jamaica tonight, are you ok?" Jack asked as the waiter began to rise.</p> <p>"Yes, and I'm not with my girlfriend. I don't really know what to get myself excited, so..."</p> <p>"Sure you can get excited. It is fun."</p> <p>"But I, I don't think I would do that with you."</p> <p>"Well we can still do it, as long it stays safe. Don't you worry?"</p> <p>"But it, it's just, not right. I..."</p> <p>"I already think we are good friends. And I'm sure we will all make each other happy and look forward to it."</p> <p>"But I have an idea. We might be better off having sex instead."</p> <p>"But we aren't that good looking."</p> <p>"Well you are. There is an alternative, but that is only for both of us."</p> <p>"What do you think, I mean what about your boyfriend?"</p> <p>"Well I think weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
