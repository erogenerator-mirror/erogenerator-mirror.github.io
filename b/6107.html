That one just happened. I have to go but don't tell anyone we went there."</p> <p>"Really? That would be great. I know it takes a lot of work and you have so little experience. Let me know if I can make the best of it."</p> <p>There was a knock on the door.</p> <p>"Hi, may I help you?"</p> <p>"No, don't." A smile covered a nervous laugh as she opened the door. "Oh, this is Jake. I was expecting some friends," he said, then followed her in.</p> <p>"What are you doing here this late at night?"</p> <p>"Just making supper."</p> <p>"Why would anyone be late for a supper then?"</p> <p>He gave a little sniff at the scent of bacon. "Oh, you mean the stuff I cook for dinner. The smell? I'm making myself a sandwich."</p> <p>"No way, I'm not. Oh, are you having lunch in?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not. I'm going to save my sandwich for a walk in the park. I've got a blanket over my feet. Let me see."</p> <p>"Sure. I'll be waiting." She looked back and saw his head disappear behind a pile of garbage. "Oh, this is so hot." She turned and walked away and sat on the porch, watching the rain pour.</p> <p>She felt like she could stand the storm for the rest of her life.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Sandy didn't make it back to her car because of the rain. She sat there, a puddle of rain soaking through the leaves. She opened her car door and let herself out. The rain didn't have the chance to get to her car and it started raining, so she ran down the street to the park. She picked up her blanket and followed Jake to his house.</p> <p>Sandy was happy that Jake had a blanket but it had no meaning on his backyard. It wasn't until they got to the house that she looked around for her purse. "I'll never get this stuff," she told herself.</p> <p>Sitting on the bench, her arms crossed in front her chest, Jake looked at her. "Are we making a habit of going to the park with you?"</p> <p>"A habit? Of that little joke?"</p> <p>He stared at her for a while and her shoulders sagged a little. "I'm just here to have a few moments with my wife. I guess there's no point in wasting this," he said then grabbed her and kissed her hard.</p> <p>Her arms went up to his neck and he started to feel her against herself. There was no foreplay; they had made each other feel good.</p> <p>They fucked like teenagers again. His hand dropped to her ass and he was pushing his dick against her. He was hard again and pulled her down so his cock was lined up with her wetness once again.</p> <p>They lay there on the bench and Jake fucked the living daylights out of her. She wrapped her legs around him as they took their time, then he slipped his cock out and she held it between the two of them. He slipped it back and forth between her legs and the sound of their flesh slapping together filled the silence.</p> <p>Then Jake was pushing back against her, harder, faster, faster, and as he neared his own climax, Sandy started cumming again. He was pumping deep into her then moving to the next deep thrust. Each of them came time after time, and each one felt a little less intense as he pumped more of himself into her.</p> <p>Jake held back then pulled out and went to his knees. "You're so beautiful," he told her. Then he stood up and looked down at her.</p> <p>He put her on her back and kissed her. "How about this? If you'll show me how much you want to do that, how about you taking a picture and taking up a video of me fucking you? We can send those in the morning?"</p> <p>"Yes. Right now, that'd be great," she said. He lifted her legs and put them over his arms, then he put his cock back into her and he held it there. At the same time, he slid himself as deep as he could, then moved back and forth again, feeling her legs going up and down his back again.</p> <p>Soon they were working together, thrusting back and forth and fucking the head and the bottom while her nails dug into his butt. Their mouths met, sucking and tongues dancing together. She was feeling the heat rising in his face as they kissed and she felt the same warmth in her heart.</p> <p>When Jake began to feel his balls swelling, he pulled back, slipped his hand and found her clit. Sandy couldn't believe how good he touched her and so soon her eyes closed and she felt herself begin to shakeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
