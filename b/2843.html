I'll take care of it in a day or two." I gave her ass a little slap then. I got all the way inside of her, held myself for a minute, and was moving. It was time I should push things a little harder. I didn't like it, and I'm pretty good at holding off, but when you have her ass in your hands, no worries that I'll get a boner. It's my dick, and I'll get some enjoyment out of this fuck and if I can't get it, then I'll let you go and let her out later.</p> <p>"That's more like it."</p> <p>"Sorry." I said as I held her hips and saw the muscles in her body start to undulate back and forth. My lips kissed the backs of her thighs, and I could feel her body starting to push more into me now. She was definitely getting into it. I could feel the pressure building inside of her. My hands went to her ass cheeks, holding them up from the side. She started to roll her hips around as I pushed in her.</p> <p>"How much more do we have to do this?" I asked, knowing that was just the idea. She was so much more receptive to what I had in mind than she was to anal sex. I could feel the muscles around me start to tighten and when I knew I was ready, I pulled back out before she had a chance to adjust to the feeling. A few more inches went back in me before I could stop myself. The feeling almost sucked the breath from her, I didn't want to pull out completely, but the feelings weren't enough.</p> <p>"I don't think we should stop until you cum, babe." I felt her ass start to move more urgently and I could feel the muscles at the end start to tighten some more. After a few more inches I felt the start to her body start to quiver.</p> <p>"Fuck!" I said softly while holding her hips. I saw her body going rigid then start to shake and I knew that she was starting to cum. Not just cum, but she was out of control. She almost jumped into me with a scream of pleasure, but I held her. She was cumming. Her body moved with my strokes in and out of her ass. It was a combination of the two sensations. There was no pain at all, nothing like the one that I had felt with Mary. I could feel her inner muscles flex as she got closer to a full blown orgasm, and the sensation was all consuming. I wanted to hold off, but knew if I tried too hard I'd go over the top. With a few more thrusts into her, I could feel myself getting closer. I wasn't sure if it was because she was cumming while I was doing that, or that she wasn't as sensitive to what I was doing. I started to think I was in the clear. That my dick was a little bigger than it had been. If I kept pounding into her for another minute, I'd probably be going over the edge. Her body started to shake and I could feel her starting to push against me.</p> <p>"Come on! I told you to wait until you're ready. We're not here to waste time. Come on! Come on, Baby! Let me hear you!"</p> <p>She couldn't believe the intensity of my words, she couldn't believe that I was holding all of her weight, and she couldn't believe that she was trying to make me stop. Her body tried to tell me to slow down, but didn't want to. Then her arms flopped around my body and she started to try to pull me out. I stopped moving.</p> <p>"Hold back," I said gently. She had her eyes closed, and looked at me. Her lower lip was quivering and she was breathing heavily. "Can I get on this?" she asked. I smiled.</p> <p>"Sure," I said. I helped her stand up, she did the same. She could feel my semi hard dick pressing up against her while she leaned over. She reached out her hand and took my dick in hers, gently massaging it in her hand, moving it up and down while her eyes closed.</p> <p>"It's a bit cold," she said when she felt me start to get hard again. She took the tip and turned to kiss me. Her tongue pushed between my lips and started to play with mine. I put my hand on her lower back while I felt her body. It was a little weird, but something I'd never felt before. It was more than exciting, but not so much that I couldn't keep myself from enjoying it. She felt different from our previous activity. It felt more like a finger or a tongue exploring her body. This time it was her tongue. The way she was feeling that tongue was making my dick hard again. It didn't take muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
