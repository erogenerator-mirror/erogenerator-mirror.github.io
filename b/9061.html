I'd never fucked like that before and it was incredible. I was at the brink until I heard what sounded like an orgasm. I came to then just before I shot my second load. I was still breathing in my own gasps.</p> <p>I was amazed at how I could cum so hard. It was so much stronger than when I masturbated. My head began to spin. I was not sure where it was going but I was starting to lose all strength and just needed to lay there for a while and calm down.</p> <p>Finally, I just laid there on the couch for a very long time, not moving a muscle, just enjoying the feeling of the afterglow. Eventually, my shaking stopped. I could move again and I found my legs getting unsteady. Maybe my legs weren't sore, I thought, they were still shaky.</p> <p>I put my hands on my breasts when I regained control of my breathing. I was surprised to find I was still horny and very turned on. I was thinking of how much of a big tit wan was when I realized there were a wet spot right where I had cum, again, on my panties.</p> <p>"What the fuck was that?"</p> <p>"Shit! You know I had never done anything like that before. I'm sure the girls here would be horrified. We're just a normal family. Just a normal family. It's just fun. You have made me cum so many times in the last week that I wonder if I've ever been as good as I promised. I had no idea you would even let yourself out like that. I was so embarrassed but I guess I liked it."</p> <p>"I think you've done some good. And how about yourself. It's like the feeling of sexual release after having sex but now you've also gotten to play with yourself. Now you're really hot. You'll never be as old as I am and you're going to go a lot. You're so attractive."</p> <p>There was an audible laugh. It was a laugh I didn't think I heard many other times. Maybe it just got me aroused again? I didn't know. I knew there was no way for me to be turned on anymore. In this moment I could only imagine how much I'd enjoyed what I just experienced.</p> <p>I wanted to get up and run to the bedroom, but I just couldn't. It seemed to take an incredibly long time. I looked across the couch at the empty beer can.</p> <p>"I didn't know what to do," I said. "I just sat there and thought about what we had done, how I was acting, and I didn't know what to do.</p> <p>"Why don't you stay? Don't try to change the subject. I've got to go so I can get dinner. It was good fun."</p> <p>I watched as a tear formed in his eye and I thought what the hell! I had the best sexual experience with our guest. Maybe that's all it would be. I knew if I could get to that point it wouldn't be an affair. I just hoped that at least one of the women would know how good the sex wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
