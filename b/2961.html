This is getting weird." "It's not for me to judge you or anything."</p> <p>"I don't think you even want me."</p> <p>"No... I mean come on..."</p> <p>"But you were just trying to win."</p> <p>"What do you think I was trying to do."</p> <p>"I want this."</p> <p>"Yes... this!"</p> <p>"I want what you've been dreaming about for so long, but I can't."</p> <p>"I... you can't? Please..."</p> <p>"But I don't want anything else."</p> <p>"No you don't."</p> <p>She smiled and pushed back the top of his boxers.</p> <p>"I promise I'll give you what you've been fantasizing about for days."</p> <p>She grabbed his boxers and pulled them off. He was already hard again. She looked at it for a moment not noticing, then took him in her mouth. Again she hesitated before wrapping her lips around the head. Not knowing how much time she had left to play, she moved to the middle of the bed and sat on it, facing. She slowly stroked his cock with her hands, and as he grew she slid them up his legs, back down, and around again and again. He grabbed hold of her hips as she began to stroke him, slowly at first, gaining speed and tempo.</p> <p>"Gimme!"</p> <p>She smiled and moved up, straddling his torso. She looked down at his hard member, inches from her face.</p> <p>"Ready?"</p> <p>"Ready," he responded. She grinned and slowly lowered herself, taking it into her. "Oh gawd..."</p> <p>She slid down and moaned.</p> <p>"It's so big, baby."</p> <p>"You have no idea."</p> <p>She kissed him.</p> <p>"That's right, let the magic take you."</p> <p>She rocked her hips and slowly, teasingly slowly eased down. He held his breath, and she reached behind herself and massaged his balls.</p> <p>"Oh, god... I'll stop... you know I love this..." he tried to warn her but couldn't.</p> <p>"Don't stop," she whispered as she rose up. She kissed him, then moved up to kiss him again.</p> <p>"It's still so big... it feels so good..."</p> <p>She kissed him again and took him back inside. She began a slow rhythm, rolling her hips back and forth. He could feel how hot she was in her mouth, and he reached up and stroked her nipples.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh," she moaned as she began to ride him more quickly.</p> <p>"Oh yeah... just like that," he urged her. Her head bounced up and down, and he could see her small tits. He stroked them and pulled on her nipples, eliciting even more moans.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she encouraged him with a groan. With one hand he squeezed and pinched. With the other he found her clit and she let him tease her, and it seemed like she came over and over.</p> <p>"Don't stop baby, I want this to last..."</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she hissed. She leaned forward and kissed him. Slowly she pulled up until they came back to eye level once more. Her eyes were locked with his.</p> <p>"God, baby I want you," she whispered.</p> <p>She guided him back inside her, and he drove into her as she closed her mouth to hold in a cry of pleasure. They locked their lips as they fucked, but were quickly back to just grinding motions. "Harder..."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Harder..."</p> <p>He reached up and wrapped his arms around her and pulled her down onto him harder, and as she began to cum he began to thrust into her deeper and harder, and he was suddenly there...</p> <p>"I can't take it anymore," he whispered.</p> <p>"Yeah... come closer..."</p> <p>He leaned up and they laid in an embrace; his right arm reached out to caress her right breast as he kissed her as he slowly fucked her back again. They could feel our juices mingling, and it seemed to be leaking out and running down her ass. He pulled out and rolled her on her side, facing away from him.</p> <p>"Come with me," he said, with a wink. He got up again to lie down on the bed with her, but was immediately on top again as they embraced in a long hot kiss.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry I never could keep my hands off of you, but my love..." he trailed off as he rolled over.</p> <p>She smiled and turned around.</p> <p>"What happened?" he said.</p> <p>There was silenceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
