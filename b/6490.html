She said.</p> <p>So, we did. I learned a little about her from her parents. One of her parents was an alcoholic. Another had left her some money and had been working in a drug trade, where he'd gotten an STD.</p> <p>Before, I hadn't known that she went to college in a state of disrepair. Now she was just one of the girls who had "taken notes" and had made the connection that she got a new boyfriend while she was taking care of me as well.</p> <p>Anyway, back to her parents . . .</p> <p>She took a second to look my eyes. "They were pretty cool about it." She said.</p> <p>"Yeah." I said. "I am just glad that they like me."</p> <p>Her eyes looked a little wild this time. "Me?" she said.</p> <p>I smiled. "Yeah, I guess all of you like me." She leaned in and kissed me.</p> <p>What the hell? This seemed pretty good.</p> <p>With that I pulled her close and started kissing her again.</p> <p>Our tongues immediately went wild in our mouths, trying to find our other's mouths.</p> <p>"We should stop." I said. "We could be an hour late!"</p> <p>"Not an hour." She said.</p> <p>"No, I mean, you two better leave before I get really mad. They aren't in the next room." I said.</p> <p>"I'm not mad." She said.</p> <p>"No wait, you're not. I mean, I'm not mad."</p> <p>"I want to tell you something, you might want to tell me." She said.</p> <p>"Oh yeah?" I said. "If you like that, how about a little something extra for you?"</p> <p>"Whatever it is. And don't say another word." she says.</p> <p>I laughed a little, she sounded like she liked me, so I laughed some and walked out of the apartment. "Maybe we will see each other again."</p> <p>Well, maybe I will.
