You got to be kidding me, huh?" He simply said, "Oh no, my beautiful wife, we need to be quiet, you and I are going to have a talk."</p> <p>He said "You're right, of course, I meant no harm."</p> <p>But the truth is I couldn't believe it.</p> <p>Suddenly I had this huge lump in my throat and I just said, "I can't believe what I just said!"</p> <p>He smiled at me, and then asked, "Does it make you uncomfortable?"</p> <p>I took a deep breath, I knew we were in a bit of a bad spot and I decided to take things a bit more light hearted.</p> <p>I said, "It's the sex, not the fact that you're a guy! I just need to be truthful with you."</p> <p>He was smiling with a huge grin and I was trying so hard not to laugh. "I'll think about it some time," I said, "but for now, let's just enjoy watching a movie."</p> <p>He just looked at me and said, "You're a hot little piece of ass. I'd give you a medal any day."</p> <p>I smiled and said, "Well, you're not on any medal, but I have a feeling I'm in love with you. Why does it bother me to watch TV with you?"</p> <p>His grin deepened as he said, "It doesn't bother me a bit. It just feels like I need some company, I don't really do much."</p> <p>I was smiling, now.</p> <p>I said, "I'm not in the mood for you to monopolize my time like that. But when's the last time you did what was normally your thing?"</p> <p>He didn't waste any time saying, "I'm good, but you know I usually hang out at home."</p> <p>I said, "What type of friends do you hang out with?"</p> <p>He replied, "There's just that little thing between being happy and being depressed. I don't usually hang out with anyone and I'm not interested in having my friends see an orgy of sex, just as I'm you."</p> <p>Now I was REALLY looking forward to seeing how much of a friend I was meeting with a young man that I didn't know.</p> <p>I just knew it was going to be awkward. "That's fine," I replied, not to my surprise, but to our "little" friends and to our immediate situation.</p> <p>That's right, I wasn't going to take any more of a chance with him, I told him.</p> <p>He replied, "Oh we'll have plenty of fun with you there."</p> <p>I couldn't believe it! I mean there is only one way we'd be able to get anything out of it! And he knew I didn't trust him.</p> <p>But I told him, "We should come to an arrangement first."</p> <p>I knew he really wanted this. And he agreed! We agreed to do it. But it's going to be a hard decision. What do we say? Can we go ahead and do it, just like I agreed, and wait it out? And then decide, when we are ready to tell our wives and husbands it just might be okay? Maybe I can convince them to let us do it. And I can certainly do that with our husbands.</p> <p>I made sure to wear a loose sweater that was loose when we met. And I kept a short sleeved white blouse on, so that you could tell that the light jacket and bra underneath were very nice. And then I went into town to buy some new clothes.</p> <p>Later that evening my conversation with Joe was very brief. I felt as if I was agreeing to a relationship, and what I was saying was exactly what I was thinking if I was going to actually have sex with another woman! We talked for a good ten minutes.</p> <p>"Joe," I started after we were seated, "I'm not sure how to approach this, but I'm sure I've got your answer."</p> <p>He took a deep sigh, "Yes, you've got my answer. I don't care if you can't keep upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
