Sasha felt so ashamed. She wasn't in the mood for fun, but Sasha saw an opportunity to tell anyone for at least an hour. It was too soon and she wanted to tell Julie this time. Julie had been right when Sasha had described her as a slutty girl after a night of sex with a bunch of people. She said that she had been very attracted to Sasha and hoped that Sasha would be just as attracted to her. Sasha sat still for a minute, staring at Julie's eyes. Sasha's hair fell around her shoulders, and Sasha couldn't seem to decide whether she wanted to go on or leave. She wanted to stay here and talk the night away.</p> <p>Julie sighed, "So, you are going in to London to have a party and maybe see a man from your home again for a while, right?" Sasha nodded. "I heard that was a good idea." Sasha could hardly believe Julie was so eager to hear her call her home. She was so close to saying yes, to Julie. It's her choice, Sasha thought, which she was thankful for.</p> <p>Sasha turned to Julie and asked, "So, are you going to come, or am I going to wait and see what happens?" She couldn't believe she wanted Julie to come. Julie sighed and shook her head. She just wanted her to go. Sasha turned to Julie, "Why don't we talk for awhile?"</p> <p>Julie hesitated and then thought. "You know, we can't talk about the future, right?" Sasha started to point out her concerns. "Well, that's not really true, so tell me what your thinking."</p> <p>Julie sighed, "It's just that..." Julie started to answer.</p> <p>Sasha's mouth suddenly curved up into a smirk. She knew her friend so well but that was not fair. She started to think, 'I mean, is Julie's going to get pregnant?' Julie tried to put her mind at ease and, despite Sasha's efforts, asked her if she meant that in a sexual way or if the relationship is going to become more permanent. Sasha was surprised that she was so excited to the point of being speechless. She had never had the desire to be with another woman. Sasha was a virgin and knew this relationship would never work. She was in love and wanted to be with Julie. Sasha knew it was wrong, but, she also knew at such an age that she had to be sure. Sasha was about to take the next step. Sasha had seen the way Julie's eyes lit up in front of Julie's face while Julie was staring at her. Sasha had seen Julie's body and felt the same as Julie, that Julie had a sex drive. Sasha had often fantasized about being with Julie. In the past, Sasha had masturbated to visions of Julie and Julie at the same time, which was just as well, if Sasha was thinking about Julie in her current state of sexual arousal.</p> <p>Sasha's curiosity was piqued. She had seen the other women in her mind's eye, so she knew what happened. She wanted to go into private conversation with Julie and discuss this relationship with her. She didn't want to break Julie out of her relationship. She didn't want her to feel uncomfortable or uncomfortable at all. She wanted to have some time to herself. Julie noticed how Sasha stood up for her. Sasha reached around her and pulled Julie to her. The two of them hugged briefly, feeling the wetness between their legs. Julie, for some reason was feeling a little uncomfortable.</p> <p>Julie pushed Sasha back and said, "I don't have much time to stay, I guess. We should talk to other girls," Julie looked at Sasha. She was still unsure of what to say in this situation. She wasn't sure if she was asking Julie for the right response to her call. Sasha smiled and said, "Sure, call me when you are ready."</p> <p>Julie smiled back. She stood and helped Sasha in the hallway. She stopped on the way to meet Sasha for a kiss. Sasha smiled back and returned the kiss. Sasha's skin was still damp and Sasha's breasts were pressed against her friend's. She pushed back, feeling Sasha's firm breasts against her own. They felt so inviting in Sasha's soft and warm clothes. Sasha pushed Sasha back against the wall of the hall and then pulled Sasha closer. Their lips met and Sasha ran her hands up and down Sasha's arms. Sasha kissed harder then ever before. She pressed her lips on Sasha's as firmly as she could, determined to drive Julie to the floor. Sasha's hands ran up and down Sasha's side, feeling her skin under the softâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
