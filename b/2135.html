I hadn't considered what was actually a sexual term to describe what I had just seen – it was all just too confusing.</p> <p>My mouth was open as I took in the reality of what was in front of my eyes in an effort to escape.</p> <p>"Come up there on the bed," he murmered.</p> <p>As I did as he told me I felt his hand stroking my bottom lip. As his finger slipped inside my mouth he sucked my tongue playfully. My own tongue snaked out to meet his. He pulled his finger from my mouth, causing me to feel a coolness as he slid his tongue along my lip. It felt odd and erotic simultaneously but as I tasted myself on his fingers I realized that I'd just accepted what was about to happen.</p> <p>He held his hand out towards me. "Put the blindfold on," he commanded.</p> <p>With the blindfold on I couldn't see where I was and couldn't hear him.</p> <p>"It's a blindfold," I heard him say as I felt him pull the soft material of the silk gown away from my body. My hands were trembling as they were gripped by the silk as he took me in. When he let go and I felt my body against his I knew he was holding himself up.</p> <p>All I could see was a deep valley of skin to his chest. He had one arm wrapped around me, gripping my side tightly when he bent his head down to take one of my breasts into his mouth. I bit my lip as my head began to swim out of control. It had never felt like this but it seemed like it was.</p> <p>I felt hands grip my hips and my legs were pulled up towards my shoulders. I could feel as much of his weight as I could and could feel him moving, sliding his body against mine as he bent over me. I knew he was naked; I could feel his hardness against me as the weight of him pressed against mine brought new sensations to my body.</p> <p>He pressed his head into my breasts and I felt myself get fuller and more wetter.</p> <p>"I want one more," I heard his whisper in my ear as he nibbled on the lobe.</p> <p>I felt his erection move against my bottom but I was so drunk with his sexual excitement and with his sexual lust that I let him know that he had me. I could have stopped him right there, but at that moment I didn't want him to stop.</p> <p>When he lifted his head from my breasts my lips parted as I spoke. "I can't – I-don't – like that." A light smile crossed my lips as my words came out. He'd told me that once, that it was something that he enjoyed doing – something that made me feel like he had the right... I couldn't get my face away as he lifted my hands and slid my gown over my head.</p> <p>"It's so sexy. I'll bet you even feel great," he whispered in my ear as he slid the straps of the robe from my shoulders. As the garment slid off my body I lifted my arms and watched as he took the gown from his hands and let it drop on the bed as he slipped the straps of my own.</p> <p>I gasped when he looked at me. The gown barely contained my breasts from falling forward as it was dropped onto the foot of the bed. I was naked but his eyes were only at my breasts, holding them as if she'd said them. I felt so beautiful. Naked, exposed in his bed with his naked body on top of mine.</p> <p>"Wow," I heard him say as he reached to wrap his arms around me and pull me against him. I lifted my face to his and said, "I-I was hoping that you'd say that. I've wanted to do that to you since I got here."</p> <p>He kissed me gently as he began to work his fingers into my bottom lip and into the crease of my mouth.</p> <p>"Oh..." I moaned lightly. He smiled up when I opened my mouth and he met my tongue. "That was like you had been with a man before," he murmured, and then slid a fingertip inside into my mouth.</p> <p>It had been quite some time since I'd had a man's tongue in my mouth but I was so lost in having sex that I didn't realize I was now doing it for his benefit. The thought that he was giving me pleasure brought a new wave of sexual pleasure though and I felt as if I were trying to draw him more into me than to me. I let my tongue roll lightly across the tip of his fingertip as he slid his tongue in and out of my mouth.</p> <p>I was lost in his kiss as I let myself sink into the feelings created by the feel of his warm body against my own.
