For a moment her eyes opened as we gazed into each others' eyes, a smile on her lips. Our lips met and her tongue explored my mouth. She rolled to her back with great grace, throwing her arms around me. We kissed passionately, our bodies pressed firmly together and still joined. I kissed her and ran my hands sensually over her body - she was still taut, the muscles in her legs rippling in ecstasy. And in response, her hands ran along my back and up to my shoulders, caressing my broad shoulders.</p> <p>"I want to move," she eventually whispered in my ear. My answer was to draw her to my neck and nibble, then nibble her earlobe. We held each other, the heat of passion building slowly and steadily. Our bodies pressed tightly together, her hair tickled my face, while my penis slipped between her legs and entered her again. Our motions were slow and calculated, inching along and around each other until we both moaned. She wrapped her legs even more tightly around me, her breasts and flat belly pressed against my chest and my penis pushed more deeply into her body. With every little thrust of my hips I pressed up against her clit, then moved a little deeper, bringing her down. She came again, a wave of her juices running over my penis and down my abs.</p> <p>As our bodies quivered and spasmed, my penis plunged deeply inside her. I felt her hands on my back, massaging my back and shoulders. Her eyes and mouth opened before my eyes in a wide smile and she came again with a moan. When we stopped for a moment, she lay limply on me.</p> <p>"That was wonderful," she breathed. "I've never ... been fucked so hard."</p> <p>I nodded. "I'm glad," I replied, "I've never been with a woman as strong and forceful as you were."</p> <p>She laughed. "Are you jealous?" she asked. Her smile returned. "Because I'm going to fuck you until midnight when I'm done with you."</p> <p>I laughed. "You've got that, you sexy bitch!"</p> <p>She wrapped herself around me once again, holding me and kissing me deeply. "I'm going to want this cock every day of my stay," she said, then giggled. "This cock is going to make my pussy sing."</p> <p>"Sounds like you have a lot of catching up to do!" I replied.</p> <p>"I don't know you very well," she said after we lay in bed, spooning against each other. "I'm all yours."</p> <p>"I intend to make you mine," I replied, rolling onto my side. I kissed her neck, nibbling at her ear. "Don't worry," I whispered in her ear. "I won't be mad at you. I'm not going to judge you. I just want to make you feel the way you're feeling tonight – like... you can feel. That's why I'm going to make you feel... sexy." I could feel her breathing becoming more shallow. I kissed her throat, the tip of her chin, and her ear. "But if I let you cum before I allow you to, it'll be just what you're afraid to let me do."</p> <p>"Oh fuck, Jack," she said, sounding desperate.</p> <p>"If you don't stop calling me Jack I won't force you," I replied, kissing her neck. "You'll feel my cock in your cunt, Jack," I whispered.</p> <p>I felt her hand move along my chest. She started to kiss my chest, then moved down to lick my nipples. "You're the only one who hasn't made me cum before," she said. "And my pussy feels a little sore I guess." She kissed me, then moved onto her hands and knees.</p> <p>I knelt behind her and watched her ass wiggle sexily as she crawled, looking over her shoulder at me with a mischievous grin.</p> <p>"Come up behind me and fuck me good," she murmured. "Fuck me hard!"</p> <p>I moved my body behind her and pressed my still-hard penis firmly against her pussy lips, then gently pressed her buttocks apart, spreading her wide apart. I pressed myself against her, sliding a little inside of her before pulling back out a bit, making gentle contact with her clit. I pressed the side of my cock firmly against her asshole and heard her moan.</p> <p>"Oh god," she replied. "Fuck my ass."</p> <p>I pushed a little deeper, my penis pressing—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
