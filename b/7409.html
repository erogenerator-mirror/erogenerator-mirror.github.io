Let's go for a walk I say!' She stood up then and walked with me across the yard.</p> <p>'What is really so bloody lovely is the little forest out back. Why so big?' We stopped. 'Look just back there, I really love the grass. They used to call it 'piss hole' when we were kids and here you can see, not that it ever needs to be washed.' I kissed her.</p> <p>'Honey, I've never been as happy as this when I got out here. I thought the trees were going to rip everything!' I kissed her again and we stood there for a minute before I told her to get used to the sun and to go out onto it. She said that she wanted to stay with me even after the little incident.</p> <p>'Why do you think I've been here for such a long time.'</p> <p>'Maybe it's because we are related.'</p> <p>'No he's definitely my brother and I love him dearly.'</p> <p>I told her about the incident with the two little trunks on the grass and how I had seen them coming up from the sea with his penis still out of his trousers. 'Did you enjoy what I did to that nice big thing?' I asked her as I caressed her breast. She smiled but she did look a little sad. 'Have you ever seen a naked man?' I asked her.</p> <p>'Don't suppose I ever will.'</p> <p>'Never?'</p> <p>'I just like looking at men.' She seemed confused and she looked down then.</p> <p>'I think you do too.'</p> <p>'Doesn't a man look as good as a woman?'</p> <p>'Of course not. Men are all silly though, and you are lovely looking!' That took the old woman off her feet and she looked at me again. 'But I have something you will like too. Now go and say hello to some other folk.'</p> <p>I got up and went out to the house and waited for my sister's return. A few minutes later, I heard laughter. My heart had pounded as much as the day before. There must have been a lot of tears but still it felt as though they were falling out from my body. I had wanted her, and her to stay with me for a little while but she had always been a bit on the heavy side and I had to tell her to go away. However, this time I had got to the point when I could take her back. I was determined to take her back. Even though I was going to fuck her, I had to keep her in the dark. It was going to be difficult to stop seeing her, but what could be the point!</p> <p>As I was leaving, I heard the sound of men. They were talking and joking which made me feel better. However, I could feel myself getting wetter and wetter. It's hard to imagine that this was just an ordinary event but I was feeling it more strongly now.</p> <p>'Now you will be happy to know that some other women will be coming soon and that none will come as we have here.' I told her as we went the garden.</p> <p>My sister had gone and came back after a few minutes with a tray. Inside was a dozen glasses of champagne. The tray contained a variety of food but when I poured the champagne she asked about it and it was obvious we had never had it. The champagne was a wonderful thing to share.</p> <p>She told me that she had been in a similar situation with some older people, and that she had gone topless in a small park. She was very embarrassed and said that she did not want to go back like that again; especially with all that had been said. She thought it was rude that I should tell her to do that but I simply said that it would be OK. We both laughed at the thought and it was obvious that she was right.</p> <p>After the champagne that we had drunk, my sister came out. 'Do you do that all the time?' She asked me. I shook my head. 'Didn't want to tell you, if you like.</p> <p>'Well I have loved to. Now that I think about it, there was a time when there was something about me that made me want to look at other women. But I always thought of you just as a younger lady but that was the age when some women, and I mean some, were quite attractive.'</p> <p>'Do you mean there was some older woman that made you want to see her in her undies?'</p> <p>'Yes, when I came into the house I tried to get her to sit round me. She never did. So, here I am sitting here at the kitchen table with you. Is that too forward?' She reached out and took my hand.</p> <p>'Notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
