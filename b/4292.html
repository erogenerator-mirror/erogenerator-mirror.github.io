The room had an incredible view of the water and the mountains. Just watching us was too much – we wanted to feel and see them and to be as far as we could travel. We turned to look at the rest of the house.</p> <p>"Oh, that's lovely, " I said "My mother and father have really taken to it."</p> <p>"Oh, I've told them you are quite welcome," the man said.</p> <p>"Well thank you, and it is an honour to meet you as well."</p> <p>He gave us both a very welcoming greeting and then introduced me. He had a large black leather-clad man sitting behind the window behind us. I don't know what he does in his spare time, and he had this deep voice. I could just hear the sounds of music in the other room, and it was a very relaxing sound. One thing that I think that most of the men in our family have probably forgotten to do is look at each other. Our conversation seemed more intimate and pleasant than before. We talked about the things in our lives, and about family, life and everything else she called it. I am quite sure that it started somewhere at first.</p> <p>I think that the man behind the man that was sitting behind us must see that his arm was still around me. I didn't think much of it, but when my hand slipped under his and it seemed an OK idea, he put his arm around my shoulder, just enough to tell me what it was for. My hand moved over his bare shoulder and moved up inside his shirt. This man must be very handsome. If, of course, his wife had not taken the initiative, I suspect that she would have.</p> <p>I don't know but I did not touch my hand under his clothes all the way to the top. In fact he had removed them completely, and I was looking for them to drop to the floor. His hand was on my bare knee. As soon as he had the shirt and tie on, I lifted one leg onto the seat which brought the top of my legs up with an incredible force. His hand felt so good and so firm as it stroked the inside of my leg, and his fingers rubbed my slit. I wondered if he could tell that I had not come. He kissed me. It felt like it took ages for me to recover. I think I may have kissed him on the lips, but I think I think in that short moment that I never kissed him back – I only kissed him.</p> <p>He pushed me up and dropped to his knees in front of me. He had his hand in my blouse, one on my clit, slowly stroking me, I felt his tongue on my lips and I wanted him in me, as much as I wanted him in his wife. He pushed my skirt up and pushed his mouth to my clit. It felt wonderful, and I began to move my knees out to the side, giving him room to kiss me further. My first husband and I never used the word "love". It was a word that never worked as a description. As he licked and kissed me, my juices flowed easily, and I couldn't control the groans of pleasure escaping my lips. The noises and tastes of them were a bit different, but the most pleasant was that he was doing whatever he was doing to me, to me. And I was enjoying it. I just wasn't sure if anything else about myself could even be described as pleasure. I think I could have had any man I wanted.</p> <p>I was so overwhelmed with passion that when I looked across at him again, he had opened his robe and started to suckle my breasts. The man of the house was watching us – but I was a stranger to it all. He had lifted my blouse and was sucking me gently – just a little, he was a bit rough at this point. This meant that his soft tongue was touching my nipples and I felt like I would come again. I could no longer hold back and had my first orgasm in a long time. I lay back on the seat, and let the waves of passion, pleasure and pain wash over me as I came. Even as they had done, they had remained so gentle as I lay there, he had moved his mouth to one of my tits, sucked it, bit it gently and pushed his finger inside of me, all the way to the next orgasm. When it had all finished – when the storm had passed – and as he was moving to release me, I just laid there, legs open, eyes closed, enjoying the feelings which had come to me. But that feeling wasn't quite gone. I knew that when he had finished, I would go through that feeling again.</p> <p>We spent the afternoon just sitting there and talking in this way. He told me stories about being with another man, how they had come to be together and how they had loved each—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
