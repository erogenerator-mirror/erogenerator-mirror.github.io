She asked, "The pool is still quite full."</p> <p>He smiled and nodded, "Well, if it's not too far, I'll go with my buddy, you'll be fine."</p> <p>It had to be a miracle for him to stay the night in the tub. She thought she was going to be the only one in the hot tub, but suddenly, she got the sense that he wasn't going to take her back to his room. "Why don't you come on in?"</p> <p>"Really? This hot tub is really hot!" He took a seat in a lawn chair opposite of her, "You're really getting out of this thing."</p> <p>"And what's that mean?"</p> <p>"Well, all I wanted to do is soak, what can you do?"</p> <p>"Well, I'd be happy to help you out," She said, "So I guess what I wanted to hear was you telling me how you enjoyed the time we spent together. I was sort of wondering if you enjoyed it too."</p> <p>He blushed, feeling that he had to tell her that, "Well, it was fun."</p> <p>"So how did it make you feel?"</p> <p>"Good. It was nice." He leaned back in his chair, his heart racing, "Well, we ended up fucking in the Jacuzzi." He gave her a teasing smile, "I guess that made me feel a little more than satisfied!"</p> <p>"Me too!" She shot up from her chair, "You are so handsome!"</p> <p>She was still standing around him in her sexy dress. He had forgotten to remove it, so he had to pull it around her. She had a very sexy body, if he knew her name. For some reason, her chest was heaving, and her nipples were poking noticeably out of the material when she was aroused.</p> <p>"What do you think?" he whispered after he let her pull it, "I've got the perfect outfit!"</p> <p>"A perfect body." She stood next to him, leaning over and resting her hands on his shoulders, "You think?"</p> <p>"Oh, I think I'll agree."</p> <p>"Well, I'll have to think before I get dressed." She leaned up and kissed him on the lips hard, "It's time for us to go."</p> <p>He didn't say another thing, he simply stood and walked them to the door. He unlocked the door and escorted her into the steam room.</p> <p>As he closed the door, she quickly turned around and faced him. She unbuttoned his shorts, pulling out the zipper while she pulled off his pants, and then pulled them off. He stepped out of them, naked now and in her hands. She knelt down in front of him and started to suck on his already fully erect cock, as he leaned back. She started to fondle his balls as his dick grew thicker and harder, "Oh, god!" he gasped, "That feels fantastic!"</p> <p>"You too, babe!" she moaned as she took his balls into her mouth, licking them, sucking on them briefly, then licked them. He lifted his cock a little and let her play for a few moments before standing up. Before taking off his wet shorts, he lifted her up, and put her on the edge of the hot tub. She wrapped her legs around his waist as he lined himself up and thrust it into her, and they both let out a squeal.</p> <p>"I can't even believe we were going to do that!" he said as he thrust again, the heat and steam filling the room, his eyes closed as his fingers ran over her body, exploring her, as he pulled into her. "God, no one has ever done this for me before!"</p> <p>She let out a groan, and he could feel her tighten and squeeze his cock, his cock filling her more than before. "I don't know, all I want is to fuck you forever!" he told her, his eyes still closed, his hands moving over her body, "I think I'm done right now, aren't I?" he said as he thrust into her again and again.</p> <p>"Yes!" she gasped as an orgasm started, "Oh, god!" he felt her tighten even more and pull at his shoulders, gripping tightly. She let out another scream of pleasure as she began to cum again.</p> <p>"You're going to make me cum. I can feel you, feel your body!" he said as his own orgasm exploded into her, filling her with his hot cum.</p> <p>They were both breathing hard. He looked down at her, her legs still wrapped around his waist and her eyes closed. "Did you cum as well as I didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
