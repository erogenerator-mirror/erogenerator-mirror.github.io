They were wet and wet and I began to tremble as his fingers pressed against them, pushing them into me, into my pussy and I could feel his hand slide over my ass hole. It felt so good my pussy convulsed and it didn't take long for him to be deep inside me. I could sense that my nipples were rock hard and when he pinched and tugged them and his other hand went down to my clit. It took a lot, but with each stroke of his hand, the waves of pleasure began to recede. I pushed my ass in his hands and as he rubbed me I felt him press the hard tips of his fingers into me.</p> <p>"You want a cock?"</p> <p>"Yes, I want it."</p> <p>"Go to the kitchen, clean up and I'll have another drink and we'll finish this one in bed."</p> <p>He stood up and walked around me as I cleaned off my body. One of his hands went to my ass and one went to the other breast. My nipples were hard and he felt the nipple harden. He pushed my ass hard, so that it pointed down into the water. My body shook as I lifted my tits so that my nipples came up. He lifted and spun me around until I was straddling him. I could feel his hand cup my tit and his fingers tweak my nipple as they passed by my body. I felt his other hand on the other tit and knew I was in heaven. He lifted me off his cock and as I tried to pull myself up he pulled at my legs.</p> <p>I knew that when my legs were opened as much as they could go they could go again, so I opened them so as not to make his cock go inside me. He took my hand and pressed my finger and thumb on my clit as he held my hips and guided me down so I could slip his cock into me. My cunt was so wet that it slipped out of my hands. He slipped a finger into me to rub my g-spot and as I felt his cock head hit my cervix my hand grabbed my ass and began to stroke him.</p> <p>With his cock deep inside me, I knew what I wanted and knew what my body needed, so without letting up I began to slide up and down, letting my cunt slide up and down on his cock. He began to meet my thrusts with his and the force of our bodies began to slap together. We both moaned as he fucked me faster and faster. I slipped my thumb onto his clit and began to rub it faster as he continued to pound into me.</p> <p>My other hand had found a place on his chest and I began to rub his nipple again. I was rubbing him with the pad of my thumb and I felt him begin to jerk and then began to shoot his cum down his cock and deep into my cunt.</p> <p>We collapsed onto the shower wall where we remained for a long time. I could feel his cock soften inside me, and I could still feel his cum being displaced by his cock as it slipped out. He washed me and kissed me, then I dried myself off and we got dressed and left.</p> <p>We picked up our clothes and went to the living room where I put my things on the coffee table, picked up mine up and we kissed briefly. He put his hands on my face, and I had to smile. We didn't speak, but I knew that each of these mornings would bring a change.</p> <p>We said our goodnights and drove off with kisses on both our cheeks.</p> <p>The following morning we met in the living room and I turned on the coffee and sat to get ready for my trip. This is the beginning of the end of my sexual life, not to mention a lot of fun that will always be with another womanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
