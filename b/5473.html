And it had been a bit of a surprise...but she was still curious about it...she hadn't felt that way with anyone else.</p> <p>"Would you think about it tomorrow?" Tom asked, breaking the silence.</p> <p>"Sure," she nodded and stood to go.</p> <p>"Don't forget to wear your best panties under that dress," he continued to say as he watched her leave.</p> <p>"Yeah?" She asked, hoping he'd give her a chance to give him an answer...something more intense.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"How can you tell," she asked Tom after she'd called him over and kissed him lightly on the cheek.</p> <p>"I don't know, I'm surprised," he said. "Because this is an unusual reaction it is a lot like when I'm not in control of a situation."</p> <p>"I know, okay," she smiled as she leaned over and kissed his lips lightly on the lips. "It's nice."</p> <p>"And it's getting harder to think straight," he teased back.</p> <p>She thought about saying something nice. But she knew in her heart that that wasn't going to be easy. She couldn't.</p> <p>"I know. I'm sorry," she admitted, pulling back from his kiss to look at the other person she was with. "But I've been looking everywhere. It takes so long."</p> <p>"What are you doing here?" he asked her, his face a mixture of confusion and desire.</p> <p>"I'm on this beach, Tom, and you're here. I wanted to ask you about something...we can go inside."</p> <p>"Sure," he agreed and stepped inside the privacy of her hotel room, turning on the night-vision. "That's okay, though. I'm not about to go back until I see you again. Besides, if you're interested, I won't be able to make it over if I'm busy."</p> <p>She felt that surge in her stomach as she saw that she'd turned him down once again, but instead of putting him down she had him toasted as she kissed him again and began unbuttoning his shirt. Then she turned his back to her and reached inside, taking his hand and putting it on the back of each of her naked breasts.</p> <p>"Touch me, Tom," she whispered in his ear, letting her hand travel all over his torso, finally cupping his erection through his khaki shorts. "Please touch me...please tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it."</p> <p>He moved his hand under the hemline of her shirt, lightly stroking her stomach. "I'll be gentle," he promised her. "Just go right from here."</p> <p>He took the opportunity at hand to remove his own shirt as she slipped her own shirt, slacks and panties off. His hands roamed over her flesh as he cupped her breasts and caressed each with his eyes. His kisses went lower and lower, his tongue moving on her flesh, moving closer and closer to her clit. He had barely touched it before she was on her knees before him. The sensation she had given him was a combination of pleasure and pain that had nothing to do with the physical sensations she was giving him.</p> <p>"Tom, I'm so wet...please, touch me."</p> <p>He moved his hand lower, sliding his fingers over her swollen sex lips and into her. The sensation of being part of something again was indescribable. She pressed her hips against him and felt the blood run into her body once more. He was making her feel good again.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"This is it," Tom said as he took her hand and led her from back to front for a quick dip in the ocean. "I'm so horny again."</p> <p>"I know," she smiled and kissed him again before stepping into the water with him. "I'm thinking of you so much I'm surprised we can't go back out at any time."</p> <p>"It won't take this long," he assured her, stepping under the water to the shallow end. "Let's go."</p> <p>They floated against one another, the water gently sluicing around them. The intensity of the water and the feel of his body and soul in close proximity sent her wild. She needed to be on her feet, to feel him as she could feel his skin inside of her and her hands. She leaned into him, clinging to his muscular upper arms. He wrapped his arms around her as they floated together. Tom's hands roamed all over her body, teasing the small, sensitive hairs that grew along her jawline and down her neck and onto her sides.
