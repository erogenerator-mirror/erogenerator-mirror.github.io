It didn't take long, as his fingers brushed the damp curls gently, feeling them grow as he did so.</p> <p>"What's wrong with now you just can't?" she said, the words barely audible as her eyes closed and started to drift to the side of the pool. "I'm so fucking dirty!"</p> <p>"Tristan!" Tristan grabbed his towel and ran for the pool edge, he tried so hard to keep the water on, however the coolness of the water just kept the heat in his core at bay.</p> <p>Tristan couldn't help but look on in amazement at the beautiful woman laying there. He knew it was wrong, but he couldn't help but feel that he should be attracted to her, despite the blatant desire to just stare at her face when he turned to leave. He couldn't help but wonder about how she felt and what she meant to him. It must have been a dream, or an experience of a lifetime, but he wasn't sure. He felt she didn't need to know any of it, it had nothing to do with why he'd ended up here, or that he'd been kidnapped.</p> <p>A few minutes latter Tristan reached out and grabbed his gear. He'd forgotten to pack any weapons, so he was just heading a different direction, which had been his intention all along. Tristan ran outside quickly, feeling he might have been too late. He couldn't let it go. He ran to the tree line, feeling that he had just stepped on a nerve, but couldn't bring himself to even make a single move. He couldn't. He just didn't know what to do.</p> <p>Tristan turned off the running water and turned back towards the house, realizing that at some point he'd run across a person, the sight of any one of the people he passed had to be hard to take. He wasn't sure if it had been someone else, but there had been no doubt it was anyone in his immediate vicinity. He just didn't know. How could he feel this way towards her? He needed to talk to her.</p> <p>Tristan couldn't stand it. He decided to walk in silence to the house and sat himself down outside. He wasn't going to say exactly what he wanted to say to her, but he was going to make it obvious. He needed to know that if he didn't try again then he would never come to her.</p> <p>He sat where he was for a few moments before he looked towards the tree line. He took a chance and looked in. And there was one more thing he needed to find out.</p> <p>"Tristan?" Tristan turned to look at him with worry in his eyes.</p> <p>"Who's there?" Tristan frowned slightly.</p> <p>"Where am I?" Tristan looked from the top of the garden to the woman lying on the ground. The man was still standing there; his hand was stroking a finger.</p> <p>"Ah..." Tristan's eyes shifted and Tristan realized that they were staring at the woman's breasts. Her eyes flew open and stared at Tristan's eyes.</p> <p>"Is he... are you ok?" Tristan wanted to ask, but at the same time he was afraid to ask.</p> <p>"Yes." Tristan's voice sounded shaky.</p> <p>Tristan took a few steps towards where the man was standing, as he did he saw that Tristan's eyes had flicked to the man's hand.</p> <p>"Is he alright?" Tristan said it with a hopeful tone.</p> <p>"I was just... thinking about him," Tristan couldn't believe that his hands were shaking as they went back to their previous place, touching his arms and face.</p> <p>"So am I ok?" Tristan wasn't expecting that, but it was true. That one look at him that day in his dream had been his first thought, and she knew it was him for it.</p> <p>"I'm... you have no idea." Tristan stepped a little further away from the man who had once been his best friend. Tristan took the opportunity to look back at Tristan.</p> <p>The man was still looking at Tristan. Tristan felt a twang of anxiety, "I... I..." Tristan could not say or do anything for fear Tristan will lose his trust, and possibly lose him again.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," Tristan said suddenly as Tristan's heart skipped a beat, "I can understand that. I'm not angry, but... I have... I have thought about this since your dream. It isn't something I can promise you or explain. But I will be truthful with you."</p> <p>"But I'm so nervous." Tristan looked to the man for his helpâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
