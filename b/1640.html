I wouldn't. I need to get home and fuck." She said.</p> <p>"You might," I said, "but I'm not leaving until you get something for dinner." She smiled.</p> <p>"I think you said something interesting about you and Timmy that night," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, me and his friends in the motel room. I said something that shocked him." She smiled. "Did you mean it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I did," she nodded and hugged me. "That's what they do when they get caught doing that kind of thing." She squeezed me tighter. "What was it?" she asked.</p> <p>"I was with you the other night, but what about you? I think you found the truth more interesting." I said. Her eyes moved from my face to look down at the floor. They looked back at me as though she were going to tell me what to do. But I pushed my face into hers, holding her. She was soft against me and it was a moment until she was almost crying again. I could feel her hand slide between us and she pulled me to her. We fell onto the floor, and the kiss was deep and passionate. I pulled away.</p> <p>"Why are your eyes still down?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said. She got to her knees and turned about. She kissed my cheek. She kissed my lips, then moved so that her bottom was directly above my cock.</p> <p>"I don't want to," she said, and put her lips on my ear.</p> <p>"Then kiss me," I said and grabbed her by the hair. Our mouths locked together. She broke off then and looked at me. Our lips never separated.</p> <p>"Please do, please do me!" she said. I wrapped my arms around her and we went at each other like crazy. I felt her hand move to my cock and she started pumping. Then my left hand slid up and down her back and she pushed harder into me.</p> <p>"Mmm..." she sighed. "God..." she said. After awhile, I released her hair and pushed her down. She put one leg on the floor and took me in her mouth. It was one of the best blow jobs I ever had. We sucked off and fucked our lips, tongue and hands. When she felt that I was ready, she swallowed and then came. She held me between her lips, squeezing me between them, letting the water run down my shaft from her tongue.</p> <p>"Fuck me now!" she said.</p> <p>I lay on top of her, lying on my back. She pushed me down on my back, still holding my cock between us. We kissed in the water as her knees went up and down. She got up on her knees between my legs and sucked me off. I reached up to her as she sucked me and slid in, then out, in again. I felt her start, then let go and I pumped her hard. My hands went to her breasts and I squeezed them. She felt it and moaned again and again. After a time, I stopped to rest on her breasts. We kissed each other for a while, then she stopped again. She lay down and I lay beside her, holding her, kissing her.</p> <p>"God we're so beautiful..." She said. I knew then.</p> <p>"I know. You should be beautiful. I know I am, too. But I'm not." I said. Her eyes met mine. She had tears in hers.</p> <p>"You are" she said and kissed me on the lips. "You are..." I kissed her again.</p> <p>"I'm the most beautiful woman on the planet. I've felt it. You're beautiful even." She grinned. "Can you hold me?" she asked and reached down between my legs. My cock was still erect, but I was no longer on the verge of being able to hold on. It got harder. I slid my hand down to her pussy. "Let me," I offered.</p> <p>"Hold me? You are beautiful, too." She smiled and held me.</p> <p>"I'm not a prostitute," I said.</p> <p>"You should. That's just how it was," she said. "You should be free."</p> <p>"Free means no more than you are." I said. She was not.</p> <p>"What if everything goes wrong?" she asked.</p> <p>"If everything goes right for you?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she said. "No, no, no! If everything goes wrong, there can be no more than you. You'll have to be free." I saw her face and I saw it, too.</p> <p>"But if we can't be free?" I askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
