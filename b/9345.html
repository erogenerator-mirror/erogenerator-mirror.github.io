I think I know what he did, but I don't think I could do it. If I could, I'd go crazy. I don't think I could just go out and pick it up."</p> <p>"Why do you want this time with me?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I guess it's because we didn't get to this point before. I didn't really know what to do, I just thought I wasn't really ready."</p> <p>"Then go with him. I can't think if that what you really want. You'll never be able to get him back. There's no turning back now. I think it made us even."</p> <p>"I really don't know, it just seemed to make me want it. I've never had this much time to think, it's still strange."

I don't want you to go through this again but maybe if we just try to get out on your own. I don't know what would be the next step."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess we'll see." I pulled her close to kiss her again and then looked her in the eye. "So, are we going to wait or do you want to break free again. You can keep your promises but you can't break free again."</p> <p>"If that's what you really think, then we'll wait. In fact, just come with me," I told her and gave my hand a tight squeeze that sent shivers down her spine. "Don't worry. It won't be long nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
