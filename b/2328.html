I can tell you that everything is just fine." I said as I placed the car in park. I reached down and stroked my hard cock through my jeans.</p> <p>"I'm sure it is," she said, "I am actually a bit sad that it isn't. It has really turned me on. I'm glad we made it out that easily."</p> <p>I looked over at her, "What are you so sure about?"</p> <p>"Oh I don't know. I just get so horny as I sit in front of the mirror. And every time I check my tits out, they seem to swell up even more. I can't wait until it gets to be too much."</p> <p>"Oh I'm sure you can figure it out. I want you so much. Please don't be afraid to explore your body right now."</p> <p>I felt her hand running along my thigh.</p> <p>"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want to see you naked. I wanted to go to the beach topless a couple of months ago, but decided it sounded too wild. We never even planned to go anywhere so soon."</p> <p>"Well in that case we should get you alone for now," she said as she turned her seat back to face me.</p> <p>We sat next to each other at the same time as we removed our sunglasses and watched some of the scenery pass by.</p> <p>"You look great," she told me.</p> <p>"Thank you," I answered, "Do you have something good in your life?"</p> <p>"Do you realize that you already know me?" she asked, "I love being your friend."</p> <p>"I do and I know that you're not the only person in the neighborhood that has. But not the only person either. I know that you would probably be a lot more fun to be my friend than someone else. If I knew anyone who would be such a turn on," she said.</p> <p>She had already noticed I had already had a few fantasies about her, so she wanted to hear it. She pulled me close to give me a kiss that made me groan in pure lust. We kissed for a very long time.</p> <p>"If just about anyone asks you a question, and you say no, don't ask. You must already know me. If you were going to be my friend, I think you would have already been in this situation before. Now let's find out what everyone is talking about when you don't say anything."</p> <p>I looked over and noticed that the place had changed. As we waited for the waiter to come, I pulled her hand and told her, "It's okay. We aren't in a public place anymore. What's happening with us tonight isn't in public. We've just decided that we're going to have a good time."</p> <p>As we left the bar, I wanted to tell her I was happy we made it out. I felt great that all of the feelings I had for her had been bottled up inside of me for so long. I still didn't understand it though. I never really felt any way about her as I had when I dated her. As we rode in the elevator together, I just wanted to hug her, kiss her and hug her so much. The thought of us being with each other again was really turning me on. I guess I didn't realize that I had been staring at her all last night. As we stepped out of the elevator and walked over to my car, I took her hand and we walked around to the driver's side and opened the door for her. Again we kissed for some time and were both a bit breathless as we got back into the car and I started the car up and we headed back to our place.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>We were both feeling a little tired after the long and lonely drive home. We decided to stop at a rest stop and rest a bit before heading inside. While we were waiting for the water to heat up we noticed that the store had an attendant that was cleaning everything inside.</p> <p>"I hope this has been a good time. I wish we could stay like this forever," she said as we watched the water turn the first shade down a bit. "It certainly has," she added as she looked over. "Do you know how lucky you are that nobody here is hitting on you? I mean, not that I'm angry, but is that what you're concerned about?"</p> <p>"Not that much of a concern, my love," I said as I leaned over and kissed her, "Just that we should just be friends, not just fuck buddies. Besides, I was wondering if you were still on the pills."</p> <p>"No, thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
