I looked at the guy; he had a wide grin on his face. "That's great," I said to him, trying to hide my discomfort with him, "but let's try to keep it slow, okay? And don't be so greedy." He reached down and ran his hand up the outside of his leg. It was an unusual, but familiar feeling for a guy to be around, when he knew that they weren't going to make a move on his cock until he did or wanted to come home. I'd seen it many a time, and while he usually liked it, it still scared me a little and even excited me.</p> <p>It really was a weird experience. This guy was making me go slow while I played out this game he'd played many times. My cock had always been hard when I jerked off in front of him, and the thought of that little electric shock sent a big shudder through me, and I involuntarily tensed in anticipation. The man turned around, looked at me briefly, and then back at his friends. "Hey!" he said. "I thought you were a voyeur." He was a little startled that I'd said something so vulgar.</p> <p>"Well, I wasn't," I said. I felt like I was blushing, and the guy just smiled, then he went back down the trail with his friend. I wondered if we were in trouble. My cock began to swell and stiffen again as I thought about the way we had played that little game. I took the hand of the other two and ran my hand over the inside of my own thigh, and between them. When the stranger turned, we stopped a few yards away from where we were standing. Now, the only thing I could do is just watch as the stranger slowly went up a bit. His eyes looked right at me and we kept going. His hand reached down toward his crotch, and I saw his eyes lift up to mine a time or two. I saw him pause in front of me, and then he got a look at the other guy, and his mouth was open slightly. A long string of my pre-cum fell from his wet lips.</p> <p>I looked down at my stiff cock and began to wonder what I was capable of. I turned back toward the boy and began to run my hands up my thighs, feeling his eyes on me. I wondered how much longer the stranger's friend could stay down there, because the thought of his friend's hands on my dick made me feel a little sick. I didn't know if anyone else could see me, but the boys watching the whole situation made me so nervous that they had to look away as I put my hands on my own thighs.</p> <p>When it was all over, I felt a thrill run through me as my cock lurched on its own, almost begging to have my cock sucked. A sudden flash of guilt and fear made me look away, and as I turned back a few yards away I saw the boy look over at us again. I turned back to the stranger in the trail, and we both stood up and walked towards the boy. When we got to him, he looked at me oddly.</p> <p>"Is this what you want? You want this," I said to him. We both walked over to him, looked him up and down, he was not quite naked yet, had dark hair and brown eyes, and his body was muscular without being bulky, all in all, not as thick as the other boy's.</p> <p>"Yes, it is," the boy said. I smiled at him when his dick was at eye-level. "I'm glad you came over," he said to me. I put my hand on his chest and he reached out. He was a little shorter than the other man, as tall as me, and much heavier. His body was not as muscular, but it was thick and lean. I felt myself getting excited just looking at him, and he leaned back a little as we came up to him. He looked down at my hard-on, and I could feel it starting to throb again. He looked at me with a knowing smile that gave me the shiver of guilt that my cock had felt when being touched by strangers.</p> <p>"How about you? Do you think you can make this, I mean I can show this kind of stuff?" he asked me as he reached out and took my cock in his hand. He looked directly at his friend, who leaned in for a hug. Then his hands came up to my waist and he stood in front of me again. I leaned down, and he slowly put a hand to the side of my face, pulling me into his arms. My cock had stiffened even more since he had been touching me, and asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
