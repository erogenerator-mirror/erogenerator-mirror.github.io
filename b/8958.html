His hands were like claws on me. He tore off my shirt and I felt blood on my breasts. My nipples looked to be pinching them. He was biting down on my nipples. I bit down on his shoulder and he growled. I moaned. He rolled over to my other side and tore off his shirt. He threw it on and crawled back up to me. I felt a kiss on my lips at the same time my own fingers were pinching my nipples.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you," he breathed so quietly I couldn't answer him. "I love you," he whispered. He laid his head to the side and looked me in the eyes. "Tell me what you want me to do to you," he said softly. I shook my head. "What does your fantasy about me mean?" I replied. "I want to be with you."</p> <p>I felt his tongue on my lips and he kissed me deeply. "I want you to be naked under your clothes. I want you naked because you're hot for me." I could almost feel him.</p> <p>"What did you say?" he asked as he slowly started to kiss his way down my neck.</p> <p>"I want you to eat me," I answered as I kissed him again. He moved to my breasts and kissed and bit down on my nipples. He sucked them so gently as he moved to my lap. I felt the hard knob of his cock against my groin. "I want you... to make love..." I moaned between kisses. "To be inside me," I said.</p> <p>His hands moved up my thighs and began to kiss me again. He lifted my legs so they were on his shoulders. He spread my legs and pushed them to the sides before kissing along the inside of his thighs. I watched as my first man had climbed on top of me. I could see how hard he was getting from my wetness. He stroked his cock with one hand and leaned in. I felt his tongue touch the wetness of my lips and I moaned. I watched as he moved his right hand to my opening. I moaned loudly. He continued to work his tongue in me. I raised my hips trying to get his tongue in. He lifted up and quickly pulled me toward him. I groaned even louder at the feeling of power.</p> <p>He positioned himself above me and moved his hips to meet mine. I felt the tip of his cock touching my opening, but my legs were still around his waist. He moved his hips to impale me and I moaned.</p> <p>I had never felt anything that good. I began to move my hips more in synch with his. He kissed me and tasted me, and I felt the warm of our bodies on mine. He felt so big. He entered me gently and it felt as though it was taking him forever.</p> <p>"I want you," I said as he entered me fully. I kissed him again as he kissed me. I wrapped my legs around his waist. "I want us to be both one," I moaned.</p> <p>He moved his hips a little faster, knowing this position always drove me mad. I had never been on top before. It was a position I used to fuck myself and was never more erotic. I wanted to be on my back as far away from him as possible. I raised my hips to meet him as he moved in-and-out of me. He did the same to me.</p> <p>"I like this position," I said.</p> <p>"I want you on top," he answered.</p> <p>He was getting me on the edge, he had my leg over his shoulder now and was fucking me and I wanted to give myself to him.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," I cried. "Oh god... I'm going to..."</p> <p>"Do it," I moaned as he pumped me full of his cock. I felt him swell inside me and I knew I'd cum soon. It was his turn to groan as he unloaded himself into me.</p> <p>He slowly lowered himself off of me, pulling me onto his shaft. "I think we both loved that," he said.</p> <p>"I'd like it that way," I moaned.</p> <p>We lay together for several hours. I couldn't believe how good it felt, how much more erotic and satisfying. Even if there may've been a bit of guilt when we had talked about it, we continued to lay beside each other in silence. It was almost like we were one person. Neither of us mentioned it one time, although it was hard to tell for sure. I knew we were still a bit in love, but I would have liked to have known when we got a divorce or had a separation. Maybe, it was the sex, but I'd be shocked if it wasn't.</p> <p>"Are you seeing anyone elseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
