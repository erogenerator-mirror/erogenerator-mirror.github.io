When the sun goes down, we'll come back to your place. We'll be back there when the sun goes down at 6:00. I know the girls are going to want to meet you. The girls and I won't miss much," I said. "They're going too, but I think I better go get dressed. We'll be back in a short while. You, get out and make yourself comfortable. I hope you have an incredibly long day ahead of you." He smiled.</p> <p>I had forgotten all about lunch in the gym. After that, we had gone back to my place. I had a lovely dinner, and I thought it would be a nice change. We talked about my work, and I had been surprised the girls agreed, but not with all their mouths hanging out. They had told me all about the new group and the girls' new life so far.</p> <p>We were at the computer, playing with a lot of new stuff for the game when the phone rang. I looked at it and then turned it off and took the call. It was the gym manager. I didn't even say hello to him. He told me I would need to call my mother and have her come over for lunch. I was about to decline when I heard the familiar voice on the other end of the phone from my mother. "Dinner should be almost ready when you get home," she said.</p> <p>I listened while they discussed my new experience of being in a threesome with another woman. I was still lost in thought when I heard my phone buzz. It was my mother's cell phone. I took a quick look at it. There was definitely an answer.</p> <p>"My friend has been talking," she said. I assumed it was my friends. "I'll meet you at the table," she said quickly. I hurried to get dressed, and returned to my room.</p> <p>I don't go out at the gym. I prefer my home. I can wear baggy shorts to the gym when I workout. My best attire is a tee shirt. It doesn't make much of an outline, though. My mom was right, I would do well at the gym. The threesome had me on that score. After I had showered and left, my mom called my dad and told him she was leaving work right after lunch. She would meet him at the park at 6:00. I was ready to leave. I didn't see a car in the lot when I got there, though.</p> <p>When I got downstairs, my mother was already dressed. "Did you take a quick shower?" she asked. I quickly took my time. She had changed into a short sundress that showed some cleavage, but not quite. I found a matching pair of panties and put two black lace topped thigh-highs on, along with a pair of low heels. For the first time, she wore stockings. "I just had the threesome with John and Trisha," she told me, "I hope you don't mind." I was still a bit embarrassed myself. She told me to hurry and get a cab when she got off work. I put on my shirt and a pair of khakis, and went to meet my mother.</p> <p>When I got to her house, I was a little surprised to see she had already changed. "Well, there you are," she said, stepping on to her front doorstep. "You looked great. We can't have you looking like a zombie." I noticed that her face was flushed enough to be one of embarrassment. She had left the front door open, and I had to look to see what she had done. I looked up at her face for a few minutes.</p> <p>"Don't be embarrassed," she said, smiling at me. "My fault, I should have done something." She paused to look me over. "You look okay," she told me. "It's the workout outfit you were wearing at the gym, though. The women who are in the group look fantastic."</p> <p>"They do?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes. And we're going to meet some of them on Thursday afternoon. We just had lunch someplace." I started to take my clothes off. "You're too beautiful," she said, and I started to put on my shorts. "No, no, I'm glad you're still alive like this. There's nobody else here. Besides, you look fantastic."</p> <p>"That's not what I said," I said. I started to put on the shorts again, and she said, "We can't have that." I turned around, and she pulled me back towards her and kissed me on the mouth. I could taste a hint of beer on her mouth. I could sense the change in her.
