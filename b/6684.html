Her hair felt damp as it caressed my skin. Her face, however, felt cold, with a few drops of makeup running down her lips.</p> <p>I could feel her chest. Her arms were tired and clammy from the exertion of trying to hold it all in. Her breasts were firm and firm with long rosy nipples straining against the thin fabric. Her back. The long, dark hair tickling my face and neck; but no other part of her body felt cold. The only thing making me feel good at the moment was the softness of her breasts pressed against me.</p> <p>In those moments, I really didn't care about the weather and what others thought or saw. I just felt the warmth of her warm skin underneath my arm.</p> <p>We lay that way. I felt her warm chest against me. She was still in my arms, her head resting on my shoulder. For that I was extremely thankful. I could even get out of the car and get some sleep.</p> <p>My arm around her waist, I closed my eyelids. Gina looked over with a smile on her face while a little smile played at the corner of her mouth. I reached over and gently ran my hand over her smooth belly. Her breasts were smooth. And I loved watching them. They were so soft. But I didn't want to squeeze them because I wanted to feel them.</p> <p>They were so warm.</p> <p>My hand continued its journey up her stomach, stopping with the bottom of my hand in the middle. I felt her body tense beneath my palm.</p> <p>Gina's chest shook a little, then relaxed as my finger tips caressed her nipple. At this point, a small sigh escaped her lips.</p> <p>My hand reached the top of her cleavage. She was breathing slowly. I slowly and lightly traced the rise and fall of her breasts. My hands followed the curve of her stomach to the swell of her tits underneath the thin fabric of her dress. Her eyes remained closed, but her lips parted ever so slightly.</p> <p>I didn't touch her there. I didn't put my hand there. I couldn't. For my part, every time we tried to touch each other, I tried to not do it.</p> <p>I don't know where I was going to touch. I don't remember. Just as I don't care.</p> <p>Gina slowly leaned her head back into me. I found her eyes with my own and we kissed. A few seconds later, I slowly lowered my hand. I let her go. With one hand, she held my head gently against her with the other, running her fingers through my hair. I could feel the slight heat and moistness from her breath against my cheek; the feel of her soft skin and the softness of her lips.</p> <p>My hand was on her breast. I touched her nipple softly. I could feel her nipple hardening under my fingers. I squeezed her breast even more. It became harder and my hand moved downward, over her flat stomach and lower. Down my stomach. It slowly made its way along the soft flesh where her thigh met.</p> <p>It took a moment for me to realize that I could have done anything I wanted to do. She was beautiful. I could imagine how lucky I must have been for her. My mouth found hers once again as I pushed my hand firmly between her thighs. I slowly worked my hand downward with no pressure. She was wet. Her lips were so soft, like silk. I could feel her warmth. I began to rub a small area on her thigh. Her moan of approval gave me confidence.</p> <p>"Does that feel good?" she asked.</p> <p>"It feels good," I whispered. And I meant it. All of it.</p> <p>Her soft body was now covered in goose bumps that I enjoyed running my fingers through. Her body was warm to my touch. I could have had her in the middle of this car with her legs wrapped around my waist.</p> <p>But for the moment, all that mattered to me was her sweet and young body. Her body was warm. She was beautiful. And I needed to do everything to touch her right now. But I was so lost in the moment that it took me two heartbeats to realize I was too far along to have gone far.</p> <p>As much as I'd liked going slow and sensual with her, at that moment, all I wanted was to pull her into my arms. My lips were already on her soft lips, but with each pass of my tongue, I could feel those soft lips of hers against mine. I could feel her tongue pushing urgently into my mouth.</p> <p>All of this time had me a state of mind. I wasn't exactly a virgin, but I was no sex-starved teenager. I'd never kissed a girl before. And I didn't even know about kissing.
