I couldn't help myself, because that started to feel so good, when you could tell we were fucking.</p> <p>I felt her hand on my cock. I was about to go crazy again, but we were getting close again. "I'm going to cum," I said. "Get back to the original position."</p> <p>My dick just started to explode again. It actually felt good, as we both came, just a few seconds apart. I didn't think it was possible, but at the same time it felt great. I don't think she realized we had just fucked until I started to spurt again, and I felt her hand squeeze that last spurt of cum onto my stomach just as she let go with the biggest orgasm I have ever experienced that I think I had ever had. There was cum everywhere and all over my stomach.</p> <p>Our bodies were like two wrestlers on a mat. I was on top of her, with her legs wrapped around me, like she had done to herself, in the shower before and the two of us lying on the blanket, our legs locked around each other, one of my hands slowly sliding her body down to her pussy. When we parted, I reached up and cupped her breasts, squeezing them, pinching her nipples. "Ohh," she moaned. "That felt...so...good."</p> <p>"Yes, baby. It did. Your pussy's so good, it even feels good when it doesn't have a dick inside it."</p> <p>She looked surprised. "It's just the right size, honey."</p> <p>"That's because it's your body's idea of pleasure," I told her.</p> <p>"Well, it's your body's idea." She was still moaning, her eyes closed, as I ran my hands over her body. She felt so good in my fingers, I couldn't describe it. I felt her tits and her flat stomach and her hips. She didn't seem to want me to stop fucking her. It felt good. I felt like a guy in a movie watching his sister's naked naked body go from being sex to being sexy and feeling sexy.</p> <p>I kissed her neck, my tongue going past her collarbone, up and over her chin to her cheek. I kissed my way to her ear. I kissed her there, licked it, then kissed her cheek again. When I moved my kisses around to her other ear, she opened her eyes and started to kiss my ear.</p> <p>"I think you'll like my ear. Did you like that?"</p> <p>"I like it," I answered.</p> <p>She smiled a smile and reached up and kissed my hair. "You should let me keep getting it," she said.</p> <p>I kissed her ear again, licking out her ear and down to her neck. She held my arm so that I could turn her around. I kissed her left shoulder, working her upper chest with the right cheekbone. I kissed her left cheek. She reached out and kissed the left cheek again.</p> <p>"Now to find out if I could make you feel really good, too. Maybe not to the point of hurting you if I did it."</p> <p>"It's okay," she said. "I want to try it."</p> <p>I kissed her right cheek, then the left, finally coming down to her ear. I kissed over it, flicking my lips across and up it, then back down. "If you do it right," I finally said.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "Do it."</p> <p>I kissed her right cheek again. She wrapped her arms around me, pressing her body closely to mine. I kissed her right cheek. She took my hand. I kissed the palm, then her shoulder, and down to her shoulder. I kissed her again, this time with my mouth working her right strap. "Are you going to pull it?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I'm not sure we should have done that so soon," she told me. The strap fell away from her back. I slid it off, and slid it off her. It fell to the rug on the mat. "No," she said. I kissed her right shoulder. I kissed her collarbone. I kissed the right side of her upper chest. My body turned her around. I kissed across her throat. I kissed down, and kissed her right breast. I kissed around her breasts, over her nipples. I kissed down, kissing down the middle. I kissed across her stomach, down to her left leg, kissing it as she lifted it. When I looked up at her, there were two white teeth, bright red. "Just use your tongue," I whispered.</p> <p>I kissed up the left thigh, until I reached her thigh.
