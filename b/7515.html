Maybe it's a little different to me, being the only one in your life," her voice faded into the background. She turned again. "Maybe it would help me get to know you better."</p> <p>"Maybe, but I guess this is a big step... and a real big one to tell him."</p> <p>"I just want to tell him, that's all."</p> <p>"I already told you that, you idiot!"</p> <p>"No I don't, Mom. I really did talk him out of it."</p> <p>"Oh come on, you've been trying to talk him out of it for weeks now. The problem is simple."</p> <p>I looked at him for a minute, "So, is your mother cheating on you?"</p> <p>"I hope not."</p> <p>I laughed. "She did say that I should give you a chance to prove it."</p> <p>"I guess that's true, but I don't know if she'll want to."</p> <p>"Then let her."</p> <p>I let him wait a while before I went to pour myself a glass. "So tell me, did she tell you that maybe it was important to you?"</p> <p>He laughed, "No, I told you, she didn't have to do anything to convince me. That's probably true. After all, I love you, and I love to hear you say you love me."</p> <p>"I love you too, Mike. And you could always tell my parents that I was not having sex, but then, you wouldn't be doing anything, and I'd just see what I need to do."</p> <p>"Then we're even."</p> <p>"So, what did you do about it?"</p> <p>"I don't want to tell him, and I know my parents would never let it."</p> <p>"What does your mother do? Have you ever told your parents?"</p> <p>"No, I haven't."</p> <p>"I guess so."</p> <p>"Mike, can you tell me that if you have sex with her that you don't want her to think that I'm cheating. No, that's too personal, for me. I'm not in the mood this weekend. Can you say it, please?"</p> <p>"You're right, Mike."</p> <p>Chapter Nine:</p> <p>I decided to go out on the town this weekend to see if she was still there.</p> <p>"I'll meet you in the bar at 8."</p> <p>"Great, and make sure you get a drink, too."</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am," I said, turning around so she wouldn't have to follow him, and then I hung up.</p> <p>I thought about what I had done a few more times with her.</p> <p>It was nice to look at her again, and I didn't care that she was still in her bra and panties, or even that she wouldn't be seeing me with a man every day! But for the first two years after we started going out, I decided that I liked a little bit of privacy, and that, in the new me, I should have kept the privacy that I was getting.</p> <p>I went to school as my senior. One of my older friends gave me a few bucks a month to spend on the weekends with a cute guy, and it paid nice. One of my favorite activities was to go out on the town, and I found that it was so great that the company that I worked for didn't know I was going anyway. And the guy that I went with was the nicest guy in the world to fuck.</p> <p>My college date was the next night. I was at a friend's place and I was invited to hang out a couple nights. I saw her a bit at the reception, but couldn't think of her that night.</p> <p>I was a little disappointed, and thought we went out for two nights. Then I realized that I was being a tease, and decided to just go for it. I felt like an old-fashioned teenager who found the world to be too old, and had no idea anything could happen.</p> <p>It was a little after midnight, and I got home and found that there was a note lying on the table, which read</p> <p>"How were you?"</p> <p>I put the note down and looked at it, wondering if I could take it to work with her.</p> <p>"It was awesome having you," I said, looking at the note again.</p> <p>"I guess so," she said, but she didn't smile the first time I read it.</p> <p>Then I thought that maybe she was hiding something, but when I looked at the note, I saw it had a line that said:</p> <p>"Hey, don't tell anyone about this, but I thought you weren't even interested at school.</p> <p>You know, Mike, I wasn't really interested at school when I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
