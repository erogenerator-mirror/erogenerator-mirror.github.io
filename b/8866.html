You want to change this relationship, right? Do you get that? It's been so very long. I... I'm not going to leave you again."</p> <p>"I've missed you."</p> <p>Her words stopped in his ear. He looked into her eyes, they were dark and soft and it made him feel good.</p> <p>"I love you," he said softly.</p> <p>She held onto him, she loved him. "I love you too," he replied. She laid her head on his shoulder and he held up her hand. She held it as they gazed at each other.</p> <p>"What?" She asked.</p> <p>"I just love you, I just don't know what to say. It hurt me but I do love you. I wouldn't hurt you because I thought that would be wrong but... I just don't know what to do. I won't tell you." He held her and they stared at the ground.</p> <p>"Well you don't have to tell me. We can move on."</p> <p>She nodded and smiled. It felt good.</p> <p>"Ok," he said and kissed. He held onto her shoulders and pulled her onto his lap. He lifted her and he sat her on his lap and they gazed into each other's eyes.</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed her and she responded. She wrapped her arms around his neck and held on to him for support as they kissed. She held onto him and he held back.</p> <p>He kissed her shoulder, she held back and the kisses grew passionate in their desire. Her hand moved from holding onto him and it made him want to kiss her all over again, but they didn't. They held on to one another like that for a long time. Finally his lips left hers and they laid there and he felt her body go limp when she fell asleep. He sat there with her in his lap and watched her sleep and as her breathing slowed and her soft lips left his chest he started feeling better.</p> <p>He lifted her off his lap and stood up and made his way into the guest room. He changed the sheets and then he stood in the doorway and watched her. He was getting harder. She was going to be happy. He walked back into their guest bed and sat down.</p> <p>"Baby, you are so beautiful," he said and kissed the top of her head.</p> <p>She smiled and turned her face toward him. "Can we stay inside tonight?"</p> <p>"Sure," he said and then he kissed her and took himself out of bed and they moved to the living room. She watched him in the living room as he sat down. He had a glass of wine and she took a glass of ice milk.</p> <p>"I'm so happy about my relationship with you" she said.</p> <p>He smiled and took a sip.</p> <p>"I know," he said and he reached out and caressed her cheek. "I always wanted to take you out on dates."</p> <p>"Really, now? I thought we were going out." She said and he smiled.</p> <p>"Yeah you did, and we always did. I loved dancing with you and dancing with you every chance we got. I loved kissing you, dancing with you. I knew you loved me but never knew what it would feel like to get kissed by someone as beautiful as you with a kiss like that."</p> <p>"You're sweet but very sweet. I mean you are gorgeous and..."</p> <p>"So are you." he leaned in and kissed her. She sighed and they kissed passionately and gently.</p> <p>Finally he lifted her off his lap and moved her onto all fours onto the couch. He took one of her legs and moved in behind her and entered her. She cried out when she felt him in her and came instantly. They lay like that for quite some time as she looked at him. He moved her hair to the side and kissed her neck. She looked him in the eyes and he kissed her lips.</p> <p>"I love you too, sweetheart. I just..."</p> <p>She laughed and she moved away from him. She got on all fours and she reached down and touched herself where he had just been. She smiled and she moved over so she could watch him as he got behind her. He got behind her and she looked back at him. They both let out moans and then they moved together.</p> <p>She moved her hand along her clit and she came again just from the sight. He slid into her and he held her hips and started moving as he held onto her hips with both of his hands. He started sliding in and out, he started moaning every so often. He held onto her hips as she moaned. Then he pulled up, holding her still against him as he started coming with her. She came again. It took them a long time before he moved them bothâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
