I was glad she didn't recognize my eyes from the dark, hooded stare. I turned around to tell her it was OK to go but she was staring straight at me from the side of the hood. Her eyes were drawn. I could see the color of her eyes as they followed every detail of her face. She was beautiful. I hoped she had the same type of features on her face. I was wondering if she was beautiful.</p> <p>My thoughts were racing and I kept wondering if she realized that I was looking at her. I felt so silly. I hoped she liked me looking at her. I kept wondering if she liked me looking at her like that.</p> <p>Her eyes moved to my chest and she kept her head down. Finally she put her hands under her chin and lifted it up. I was not aware that her hands were there. Maybe she took my erection out and wanted me to touch it? God I hoped so. Maybe she didn't know that I was looking at her and wanting her to touch my erection?</p> <p>She lifted the front of her hood and showed me her body. She looked beautiful sitting there with her skirt hiked up around her waist and her skirt pushed to one side so I could see the dark skin of her bare hip.</p> <p>I felt my balls quiver in anticipation. I reached out and ran my hand down the length of my shaft. When the touch sent tingles through my skin, it sent my penis quivering like it did on the airplane. Then I put my hand back under her hood.</p> <p>Her body was so smooth and soft. I wondered if she had even remembered I was looking at her. I wondered if she had changed the color of her hair or if she could feel the fabric of my body against her.</p> <p>My hand traveled up the side of her thigh and I could feel the swell of her sex. Then, without warning, I touched the small patch of damp pubes. The lips were slick and soft. The small patch of hair was dark but I knew it would turn brown later. Was she getting off on me touching her so close?</p> <p>I couldn't believe it. How did this happen? Why did she put me there and be so turned on that it turned her on so? I wondered if my hardness was the cause of her feelings of arousal.</p> <p>I moved my finger toward the tip of my cock. I touched the swollen purple crown. I felt it jump. I took the tip of my finger and put my thumb under the eye of skin and gently pushed up my head. There was more of the wet pink stuff and it slid down into my fist, up my finger. I was amazed at what an electric shock it sent the way it made her body. My finger made light movement on the soft hood covering her small clit.</p> <p>My fingertip found the little hard nub sticking up out of the hair and I let it continue to move over her. I rubbed my thumb slowly over the shaft. Her legs spread wider and her thighs became wider. The lips of her pussy opened as I rubbed her. I could only think "ohhhh", my penis was throbbing and my head was as hard as a rock.</p> <p>Then, I felt her push her bottom up against my hand like she was pulling her legs up over my shoulders as if she wanted me to go harder. I realized I was touching her in her body. It seemed so natural and I was feeling the wet silk of her sex as my finger touched her clit. Her knees went higher and I realized she was moving her hips toward me like a woman. The wet spot on the front of her panties was almost like the lips of her vagina. I felt like I was watching a film with a woman that had just taken a cock up her vagina.</p> <p>I felt the muscles of her thighs tightening and the heat started spreading between her legs.</p> <p>I held my hand still against the hood of her sex. The pink skin felt like a tiny finger wrapped around the hard, pink rod of my erection. I felt the tingling of her vagina pulse around my finger.</p> <p>I moved my hand forward. It felt like my finger could move a quarter inch or so across the flesh of her pussy lips and up toward her clit.</p> <p>I was afraid I wanted to pull away or get up, move my pants and run my fingers through my pubes. I wanted to see her face. I had to find out what she wanted. I moved my finger up so the tip touched her clit. The hood was shiny from the slick fluid and I could see the pink muscle of her opening move toward my finger.</p> <p>I felt her hands move up and down. Then she used her fingers to spread her lips open and I saw her clit sticking straight out. When she turned her head to look at me, I pulled the hood back and ranâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
