They only had an hour to get there."</p> <p>"So are you staying there tonight with her and making up for it?"</p> <p>"I think so."</p> <p>"Do you want to stay here tonight? If she leaves you for the night, she will leave you for another woman."</p> <p>"She doesn't know that, but I guess I'm willing to talk to her myself. I just need to know where I stand with her."</p> <p>"I want more than that. She may be my best friend, but she's mine. If I ever get to know her, I will tell her I've fallen in love with a girl that I had a crush on for the last year."</p> <p>"Do you know her name?"</p> <p>"She's not a friend, she's her lover."</p> <p>"How do you know this person is a lover?"</p> <p>"She left me an email yesterday telling me she'd be at our place for cocktails and that maybe I should pick her up before midnight and let her be with a man I've been dreaming of for the last year. I was wondering if you'd still have one."</p> <p>"Yes I do, but do you have a man to take care of me," she said with a hopeful smile on her face.</p> <p>"I don't know who you are, the reason I'm calling, but I'm interested in meeting you and possibly marrying you."</p> <p>"You'd be more than welcome to take me to dinner and an evening dance like we saw last night."</p> <p>"We'll take your word for it, but we'll have to wait until we're married before we do that."</p> <p>"So, am I going to tell her if she doesn't want to let me stay with her?"</p> <p>"Yes, you'll have to tell her that I have told her that my marriage is a sham. She already knows that, but I don't see this going too far and I don't want to ruin your relationship."</p> <p>"Do not worry, but I do need to ask you again. Are you staying at The Venetian Hotel?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I am staying at our hotel. I need sleep."</p> <p>"You're staying on our side of town tonight, so I'd suggest that you stay up with us, so we can get a head start on dinner."</p> <p>"I told you, we're not going to be married." "What's that supposed to mean?"</p> <p>"You know."</p> <p>"No, that's not all I'm going to mention," she said before adding, "Do you have a problem if I'm the first to go to bed with you?"</p> <p>"No, that's fine. I've got something very special planned for tonight."</p> <p>"Then are you coming or going to stay up with us."</p> <p>"I'm going to be staying here tonight, and we'll be going to The Venetian."</p> <p>"I know, but I'm so jealous of your husband that I'd be happy to share you with the Venetian."</p> <p>"We've been married less than eight months, so I don't want to hurt your feelings."</p> <p>"Are you sure about that?"</p> <p>"Absolutely."</p> <p>"Then what about your concerns about us being exclusive?"</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, I don't want to have a problem with it," she said, with a sad face. "We're the only ones here tonight. When we get ready to go to bed I'll tell you about my plan."</p> <p>When we arrive at the Venetian I have her in the limo waiting for us to get out. She gets a glass of wine, so she sips it and looks around the large room. There is a beautiful marble fire pit overlooking the entire ballroom in the center. There are four beautiful love seats in that area, but there are five other love seats arranged around the center of the room. A large screen is mounted on the wall as well as one directly in front of the fireplace where two dimly lit lights stand on. She then looks around the room again before saying, "Wow, there goes my plan."</p> <p>"I wouldn't say there," I interupt her. "We've been here a long time and it really doesn't have much to do with us. However, I'm surprised it would take another six hours to get it done. There aren't many places that are in a fair league like there are at The Venetian."</p> <p>"We can get it done. My lover is staying in this room tonight."</p> <p>We are shown a long table and two beautiful womenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
