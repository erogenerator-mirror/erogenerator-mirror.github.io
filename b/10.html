I just came from one of those relationships; you may be able to give a blow-job and swallow his cum.” I replied with a wink.</p> <p>“No, that does not make any sense, no? But you should just let me do the work. I like what I do, my favorite thing about it is giving you a nice handjob.” She said, a bit exasperated.</p> <p>“Sure, no problem.” I replied, my cock still half hard and throbbing with desire.</p> <p>“Well, let’s see how this works shall we? I will let you suck me if I can go that easy on you? If I can get you to do anything, no questions?”</p> <p>I wasn’t sure how to say it, but I was game for anything.</p> <p>“Sure thing,” I replied, turning my smile to her again and giving her a wink.</p> <p>We took a leisurely walk back down the block, the walk was long, and the anticipation was killing me. I could not stop thinking about those breasts, and how my cock would soon be rubbing against her. We got back to my place and as we got out my cock got even harder to no end from the thoughts running through my brain.</p> <p>I walked up to my room, which I have set aside for me for my office. I quickly stripped off all my clothes and threw them in the dirty clothes hamper on the bed. I had turned on a few lights but didn’t bother changing myself because my cock has always been in my bedroom.</p> <p>I walked into my office, closing the door, taking out all my toys, and laying them face down on the table on that table. I grabbed my cock and stroked it a few times, trying to remember what worked and what didn’t in the other room, until I was satisfied with the technique. I laid my cock on the table and lay down. I stroked my cock for about a minute before I decided to finish my work as quickly as possible, when I noticed the door of my desk was open. I quickly made my way back to my bed to find that I had just seen a smile come across her face. I could not tell the moment she noticed my dick, and she did not notice what I was doing. I decided to go ahead and see if she would continue with my work, so I walked over to her, and leaned over, gently whispering to her. She turned around, her eyes never leaving my cock. I was rewarded with a look of curiosity as if she had not known that this is what it looked like.</p> <p>”Come over here….” I said as I gently pushed her back onto my desk.</p> <p>”Well, there is no way you would just take my hard cock in your mouth if I want,” I asked, my lust in full bloom in that moment.</p> <p>“I’m not sure that I could handle it if you just started sucking my hard cock.” She responded with her head hanging over the edge, giving me a perfect view of her ass swaying back and forth towards me. I could see her cheeks moving, and I could tell by the movements she was in that she was getting into it.</p> <p>”You want to be a pro, then you’ll give me a blowjob?” I asked as I placed my hands on her hips.</p> <p>”Well…. well….” she stammered.</p> <p>”If you still want to show me how good you got me? Let’s go to my office, if you wouldn’t mind?” I asked, wanting to hear her say my work by ear.</p> <p>“Well….I would love to, and I think you are ready, but if you don’t mind, I’ll do it for you?” she whispered, her desire evident in her voice.</p> <p>”What if I can’t come in here?” I asked, and I did not know who would hear her.</p> <p>“I just can,” she smiled.</p> <p>I followed her lead, slipping my fingers inside of her panties and slowly moving them down her legs, feeling that I was going to have to take them off. I slipped them off, and quickly stood her on my desk, so that I was on top of her kissing her as we continued to strip each other of clothing. I continued to kiss her as I continued to unbutton her blouse as I kissed down—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
