She had a twinkle in her eye.</p> <p>"We're doing it because neither of us likes to take chances on getting caught." He pulled me back down to kiss me. I could smell myself on him. He was getting more aroused. He pulled my face down to his and pressed his lips to mine. My body was melting as I melted into his powerful frame. Our mouths slid over each other as we pressed against each other. I could feel him in me. I could feel him on me. It was a powerful physical sensation. He was still my husband. I'd only experienced sex with another man as part of the marriage agreement. I was being intimate with that man. He was my husband. I loved it. I wanted to say it was wrong. But it couldn't have been, would it without the agreement? And I was glad I'd never asked. This was happening, it was really happening.</p> <p>I pulled myself away from him. "I want to do it again but we'll have to do it differently after we're married and I can feel you and I being closer. I think I've still got a lot of time if we go slowly. So I'll be able to tell about your sex life before you feel the same way. But I'll just tell you about it on a regular basis. This is all to do with me if you're interested, so it doesn't feel weird. I'll keep it like a family secret, all our secrets. But you can't get away with telling me, it's our job to keep it honest." I kissed him again. I wanted to tell him. But it would be like telling her we were married. What would I tell her? No, what if she found out? But it was just sex, no big deal, they just did what they did. We would end the marriage a virgin. That was how the relationship developed from the start.</p> <p>We were both breathing hard as we came up for air. "You're a beautiful woman. I can't wait to make you mine again". He got off of me, I got off the bed and he got off the bed. He walked back to the head of the bed, his erection springing free, it was standing about seven inches from his thighs.</p> <p>"I don't know if you can take me" I said as I stared at his cock, not knowing what to say. I started to laugh at my own joke. I hadn't thought of that part of our marriage. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that, I just thought we would get it right. I'm sorry I don't know what I want to do about it, we didn't discuss it. I didn't want to ruin my marriage, it couldn't be our thing. I was just joking with you, I'm sorry I didn't think that it's important to you that I didn't get you off. I promise we'll have more of the same sex. I'll be gentle and slow but you'll be more than ready for it. I won't take advantage of you if you don't want it. I know you're a married woman and I know that you really do enjoy being with other men. I want to be sure that you don't make a pass at a stranger just to have another cock in your hot pussy".</p> <p>"I thought you enjoyed that, at least that part, in the beginning." I could tell how much I had angered him by not telling him in the beginning. Just the thought of him fucking a beautiful woman, had just made my orgasm harder than I could have hoped, and the idea of losing him made me hot. He smiled as he walked slowly towards me and held out his hand. He lifted me to get on the bed, I couldn't move because I still had my dress on over my panties. I lifted my legs and he removed his, I couldn't do anything as I got on the bed, I couldn't resist the temptation, to touch him. I wanted his kisses. I wanted to feel his cock inside of me. I wanted to run my hands over his body. I wanted to kiss him so badly, my heart was racing, my breathing was a little rapid. I looked up at him, he was a good looking fifty something, kind and very attractive. "I want to be the one who gets to decide if I want to be in your bed. But I'll be gentle and quick if that's what you want. If you want a quickie, I'd still like to see you fuck other men." He smiled. He looked down at his cock and was just inches from my face. My body still tingled as I felt his hand stroke my leg. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
