I'll bring you in when we get a chance. If you leave before we're there," I assured her with a kiss. "You're here now, you can go."</p> <p>Marianne looked at me with tears in her eyes and nodded her head vigorously.</p> <p>"Please don't leave...please be with me, I am so scared," she pleaded.</p> <p>"It's okay, I love you," I assured her again. "Now get off that desk."</p> <p>Marianne slowly moved towards the desk behind which the camera was hidden. She opened the cabinet top and took out the black satin robe she had on earlier. It felt nice against her body in the most delightful way.</p> <p>I was still dressed in my business suit when I brought the camera over. Marianne quickly covered up her nakedness and looked shocked, confused, and worried at the same time.</p> <p>I knew what had happened before but now I could see her body. It's beauty was overwhelming and for just a second it took my breath away.</p> <p>It was hard to take in but finally I was captivated by the sight of the beautiful body the robe revealed. I knew the picture must have helped her to recognize me but I don't think she realized how beautiful I was. I was sure it made her feel good.</p> <p>After looking at herself, she put the robe on. The robe clung to her body like a second skin. My eyes took in the beautiful sight of Marianne's body and felt a rush of satisfaction come over me. I was no longer in control and soon I was looking at Marianne.</p> <p>Marianne was just beautiful in the full glory of it. My heart was pounding in my chest, my mouth was open but I could barely swallow or speak. I watched as Marianne's nipples erected a beautiful line in the front of the satin robe. I could practically see the color increase and I realized the robe and the robe could be seen only when her nipples were erect. I felt my cock stir and lengthen, I really needed to get out of my pants.</p> <p>I stood up to grab my glass of wine from the cabinet. It was a long one I was sure I could do without. Marianne's eyes were still on me, she was trying to adjust herself. I smiled at her as I took a sip of the wine.</p> <p>"You looked so good today," I said looking in her eyes. "I needed to get away from work. I'm so glad I brought the camera," I said with just a touch of sarcasm. "Do you enjoy yourself today?"</p> <p>Marianne was not answering directly. She looked from me to the door before looking back up at me. I caught her gaze before I spoke, giving her a smile as she looked back at me. I was so glad she had come to stay with me. We both knew I had to be the one to end this. She must feel like the last person to see me with another man!</p> <p>"It's okay. I'm not offended but I'd really like to give it a shot at you tomorrow. I hope you don't..." I tried to say before I felt I would pass out.</p> <p>Marianne looked at me in despair before turning away. "It's alright. You could give it a try. I understand that you're in a state but....."</p> <p>"Don't worry. I can't see you," I assured her. "I'm really proud of you," I said as I looked away from the camera.</p> <p>Marianne stared at me for several minutes before finally composing herself. Just her presence in our apartment sent an icy chill through me. I would never act this way toward a woman of whom I'd just seen the sight of her naked body but it was so nice to be able to share this with her.</p> <p>"I'd like that," Marianne smiled. "But I really need to clean up, I'm sure you like that," she said looking up at me with a smile on her face.</p> <p>I nodded and walked towards the bathroom. I was a little more aroused now than I had been before Marianne got home. She looked so good in her sheer robe. I needed to make love to her again.</p> <p>As soon as I returned to the table, Marianne was sitting on the couch kissing me like a woman possessed. This kissing session lasted for what seemed to be ages but in reality was just a few seconds. Marianne's hands were playing with my chest and she was moaning softly as our bodies touched. She pulled my face closer to her. "Let's 69!" she said.</p> <p>I knew sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
