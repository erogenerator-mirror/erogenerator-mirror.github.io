"Don't tell anyone."</p> <p>"We're going to do it soon" he whispered back. "Let's make it a long day of love, baby. Let's hold it together and enjoy the feeling."</p> <p>They were sitting together next to each other, their hands entwined in one another's and looking into each other's eyes, kissing and softly caressing. Both of them were so warm and comfortable and happy. A lot of people may think it was an old love-making episode, but here it was as though they had been doing for a long time, and they knew exactly what they were doing. He looked down at her face and saw her lips moving, her tongue lightly licking her lips. She took his hand and leaned over to kiss him. His cock was now beginning to swell inside her, it pressed against her belly.</p> <p>"I need you to slide up."</p> <p>"Oh, God, please! I can't! It isn't right; of if we're going to make love, I don't believe we should."</p> <p>"I know you agree. Now I need you to go into the bathroom and take your pants off, baby. We're going to love each other a lot more than just the sex. And I'm not just going to enjoy it for all day, but you're going to love it too."</p> <p>Before he got to go in the bathroom, he moved back to stand outside the shower curtain. He turned to watch her strip. Her nipples were hard as diamonds, sticking straight out and her breathing short and shallow. He knew she was wet there too, and her lips parted as she lowered her hands. He could see how her pussy was open and slick, glistening as it opened in front of his face. He reached his hands over and cupped them, just as he had felt her hands. The soap had been running into his hands and he was rubbing them everywhere he could reach. Her mouth turned up to look at him as she ran her hands across her breasts, her hips twitched as she reached behind her and touched herself. Her breasts were so sensitive and when he leaned over and sucked a nipple, she gasped and moaned. The feel of his fingertips moving over her stomach and across her clit was sending waves of pleasure through her.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah... I can feel your hot little pussy getting wet," he moaned.</p> <p>"Oh, so fucking good! Your finger feels so good in me. Oh, oh, I'm about to come! Come with me baby, come with me." She moaned as his fingers found her clit.</p> <p>"I want to feel you come! Oh, yeah, Oh yeah!!"</p> <p>He had seen it happen. He felt the pulsating in her pussy and he knew she was about to cum. "Oh yeah! Uh huh, mmm oh, yeah!" she grunted loudly as she felt her body come and release everything it had been holding back. With each wave she could feel him throbbing inside her, and she pushed her hips back to meet him. "Oh, God. I can't believe how good that was! And you are so good at your clit! That was amazing, baby." She looked down for a moment and then grabbed the shower curtain and pulled it back open, letting her cum drip down her leg before turning around to face him.</p> <p>"I'm just not sure if you're ready for me right now. But I'm not afraid of it. I didn't put your cock into my mouth just then."</p> <p>"I know, I just wanted to be able to feel you in me. So I wanted to make you feel good, too. Why is it so hard for you to feel like this, so much pleasure? You really like the way I make you cum and you feel good, that's all."</p> <p>"I think I like it just the way it is. What else can I want from you?"</p> <p>"You can get what I want and you can have what I want, just relax and enjoy it."</p> <p>He kissed her lips and then slid his hands up to cup her breasts and squeeze them. The sensation was incredible and he couldn't help but feel the love in her kiss. "We're going to keep this lovemaking for our whole trip and if you're ready, would you like to make love right now?"</p> <p>"You sure?"</p> <p>"Sure," he said.
