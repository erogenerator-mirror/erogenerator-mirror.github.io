"You weren't as horny as you would like to be."</p> <p>"Yea," she said, moving her gaze from his eyes to his face again, her breath escaping her in a thin sigh, "there was another guy who was so nice. And I liked the guys' attention. So he and I would hang out at my apartment. Sometimes I would be out with his friends or go for a walk. And I would just watch him sometimes, and sometimes I would do something in return."</p> <p>"You were a little girl," he said, stroking her cheek. "What are you and another man like? Are you trying to make love to me?"</p> <p>She nodded her head, and he knew what she was thinking.</p> <p>"Did you enjoy it?" she whispered in his ear. "Did he make you feel good, or did you just want to fuck him? And did he taste his own cum?"</p> <p>For some reason, the thought of what she was feeling made him almost cum. He almost wanted to, it was just that he didn't want to hurt her. But there were too many things about a girl that went with being a woman and being a man. Maybe it was all a subconscious thing. Maybe it wasn't the whole thing, but she wanted to share some of her pleasure with him.</p> <p>"He tasted like a man," she finally responded, her words dripping with sex appeal. "I tasted another guy, and it tasted even better. I don't know how you taste like that, it is a flavor that you wouldn't like, it's not like a big mouth of a man like yours."</p> <p>"Oh, it's different," he laughed. "You know I like the flavor and taste of another man."</p> <p>"I know what I taste like, and I would love to feel you inside me," she admitted, and in that moment, she looked around quickly again, wondering if anyone was looking. It felt strange to have both the realization that he was looking so deeply at her, and the realization of how she wanted to be. Of all the others, it felt both good to have him look at her and talk about it.</p> <p>"Do you think you are ready to make love?" his voice broke out of her thoughts, and she turned her head to look at him with a look that made him think of his own eyes, and not only that was his own eyes.</p> <p>She looked at him for a moment, and decided to change the subject. "You really liked that guy, wasn't that what you want to do?"</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>She felt her own eyes well with blood, just as it seemed to be for him, and it showed clearly to him.</p> <p>"Did you like him?" he asked her again.</p> <p>She felt herself blush again. "Of course I did," she finally answered, her voice even more breathy and sexy. "When he started to fuck me, and I felt him cum in my pussy, I felt that guy's cum run down my legs, so much that I had to let him take it off me so he could fuck my pussy again."</p> <p>"I am really liking him."</p> <p>"He is pretty and handsome," she finally told him.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"It seems a little strange," he said, his voice almost pleading with her.</p> <p>"You think it is weird?" she responded in reply. "We both agreed that, and we both enjoy it. Why is it unusual?"</p> <p>"I don't know, it just happens," he replied, although he wasn't sure if he was right, she was saying it in a different way. "Do you think it's wrong if it's not okay to do what we already did?"</p> <p>"That would depend on your feelings," she stated, feeling the tension inside of her rise again and again with the question.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>Just then she felt his hand come up to wrap around her waist and pull her closer to him as he leaned forward to kiss her lips. Their kiss deepened the instant it took place, neither wanting to break it now. Her heart felt as if it should have been racing. Both were so horny to begin with. They wanted each other in a way they had never before done before with each other. She didn't know it exactly, but she had decided to share that idea with him one day.</p> <p>As he continued to kiss her, he gently eased himself off of her and lay her back on the bed. After he was in another position, he kneeled between her legs and started kissing her again, and even before he had started, she knew what was coming next. She was already hot and wet as he began to work on herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
