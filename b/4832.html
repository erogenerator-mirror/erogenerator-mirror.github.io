The first contact caused her to gasp. She could feel herself getting heated up, and she found herself pulling on her own nipples.</p> <p>The feeling was indescribable, she felt her pussy swell.</p> <p>"Yes, you are gorgeous. Don't you wish it were me doing this to you?" Alex whispered.</p> <p>With a moan, she grabbed his hand and pulled away. Alex stood up and grabbed his bag, then she turned and looked at him.</p> <p>"Please, be gentle." she breathed.</p> <p>There was no more hesitation in his voice, neither did he want to. He wanted all of her right now, and all she had to do was go through that final stage and they would be lovers, and they would have sex, and it would be wonderful.</p> <p>In the end, she would simply be a tool to be used, just as the roles between them began.</p> <p>"Take those robes off." she heard him growl.</p> <p>She started to pull the robe off, but he caught her wrist and stopped her. The robe fell off her body in a slow motion, she stopped to admire in the mirrors, taking it off herself. As she did so, she looked at his hard on, which was straining against the towel, and wondered what he would ask.</p> <p>"Let me put it back in." he teased. "Please."</p> <p>He moved to sit on the edge of the bed, watching intently.</p> <p>"I have never seen one of these before, and I would be willing to bet it's about to die." she said softly as Alex opened his towel and stepped out of it.</p> <p>"I'd hate to think that we didn't take good care of each other." he joked, sitting down on the bed. "But I do want to make love to you, and after that, we will do absolutely anything you want to do."</p> <p>He pulled her onto his lap, and she was surprised how soft and warm she got. He started kissing up her body, leaving a light trail from her breasts, up to her neck, and then to her chin. His cock hardened instantly once on her neck, and she had to have felt it press against her bare breast.</p> <p>They sat like that for a while, and they talked about each other, enjoying their time together. They laughed quietly, and then fell into a soft quiet rhythm.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 9</p> <p>She was so sleepy and she still couldn't believe that she was here naked in Alex's arms.</p> <p>She woke up late one morning with Alex's head pillowed on her stomach. They ate breakfast and went to the park along with the water park, where they had the picnic lunch.</p> <p>She could feel their bodies pressed against hers, her pussy tingling as he rubbed her leg.</p> <p>"I've got to go to the bathroom." she whispered. "You're not being naughty again, you know."</p> <p>"I didn't have to be. I'm not really naughty."</p> <p>She heard him growl.</p> <p>"No, no," she said, "I'm not. I've only had a few orgasms. I'm yours."</p> <p>He lifted his head and kissed her cheek, and then sat up.</p> <p>"Where is your robe?" he teased.</p> <p>She stood up and quickly pulled her robe from around her shoulders and dropped it to the floor.</p> <p>"I'm going to take this robe off anyway." she giggled. "But we'll have to put it on first – or maybe we will."</p> <p>He followed her to the bathroom to look in the medicine cabinet. He opened the medicine cabinet and pulled out some toothbrushing gel and a large brush.</p> <p>"Will the brush always fit?" she giggled.</p> <p>"No, it'll just keep you warm and keep your mind occupied."</p> <p>"I am the same way!" she said, "I feel safe being in your arms like this – it's just the way I've always wanted it."</p> <p>With that he kissed her again and they cleaned up and threw some water on. When they were done, he pulled her into his arms and gently kissed her. "What do you need to do next?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just wash up, get dressed and come back when you're ready. Don't worry, I'll take care of everything, right?"</p> <p>She thought about it. The things she might be thinking now didn't matter as much as Alex's actions did.</p> <p>She wanted to know what was waiting for her. But she knew that there was nothing that she hadn't already shared, and she couldn't wait to see what was awaiting—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
