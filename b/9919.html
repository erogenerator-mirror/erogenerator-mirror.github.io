He whispered to me. "I will then wait a couple of hours and then drive you to get cleaned up, just as you were doing yesterday." He kissed me again with his lips pressing into mine, "I'll be there shortly."</p> <p>I laughed. "That's easy."</p> <p>He kissed me again for another long moment, "Thanks for being kind to me; it was nice being here."</p> <p>I grinned. "I enjoyed working for you. I'll be glad to work for you again tomorrow."</p> <p>With an impish grin, he kissed me one more time, "I knew I was on the right track." He paused for a second, then he lifted the hood of his sports jacket back and showed my the door to the garage. "You have a good evening. I'll see you Friday or Saturday in the office." He kissed my on the bridge of my nose, "See you for the weekend."</p> <p>I smiled. "I'll have my work over with, so to speak."</p> <p>"Thank you." He kissed me one last time and got off of the porch, "If I may, let me give you a head start on the way down to the beach!"</p> <p>"I can't believe you just said that!" My stomach was in knots. What do you do when you think about what he might have said? "Who do you think gave you that kiss?"</p> <p>He laughed, "I don't think I do!" He gave my butt a kiss. "Now, I will be out of here," he said as he went to the door and kissed my hand, "let me get out of here."</p> <p>I held the door open for him and we walked inside to his Jeep. We kissed once more as I closed the door behind him. "You're a good kisser, baby."</p> <p>He smiled and kissed me once more, "There's no doubt about it."</p> <p>"Do you have to do anything tomorrow?"</p> <p>He laughed, "Of course. You did great."</p> <p>I laughed, "That's good, I think I'll have a really good time tonight."</p> <p>He grinned, "You will."</p> <p>I felt I really meant it. "I know," I replied.</p> <p>~ ~ ~ ~</p> <p>My first stop of the day was the office, and as I arrived at Mr. and Mrs. Smith they were all over the house. I went to the office and joined Mr. and Mrs. Smith on one side of the desk. They talked business as they brought me a cup of coffee and some lunch. When Mr. Smith and I were alone in the office, Mr. Smith told me he'd heard I'd been in town all day, and that he was surprised to see me again.</p> <p>"Why are you calling me by my first name?" I asked. "I thought it was nice that you'd decided to come visit me again."</p> <p>"It is nice," he leaned back in the desk chair and looked over at me, "and I think you enjoyed the time we spent yesterday together. It's nice to see someone else around here." He pointed to my eyes, "You see, my wife had not been kidding about me. You did come back to work happy."</p> <p>"It's more than happy, it's sad." I replied. "I'm sorry I did not call and say I'd like to come again. I really do, and it wasn't because I was lonely or unhappy." I looked at Mr. Smith. "She said you wouldn't mind if I'd been your neighbor again."</p> <p>"Oh no, you said something good, but that was about all I could think of. She called you, and I thought she knew you were seeing someone else."</p> <p>"I guess my own curiosity got the better of me. I was thinking about getting her to tell me about a guy she was seeing that she did a favor for."</p> <p>He smiled, "I know." He looked over at Mr. Smith who nodded, "Let's take some lunch, then we can talk some more."</p> <p>I followed Mr. Smith into the dining room, and they sat in the living room together. I was really impressed with what I saw at first glance. It was a lovely home, not as lavish as I'd expected, just a bit nicer. A few more chairs had been cleared away and more of the dining table had been built out on the far side of the room. A large table was set against the wall and a couple of more chairs were placed around where I could sit down on it. Mr. Smith sat back and Mr. Smith stood and went over to the fridge to get us both a soda. He came back with them, and we sat down on the end of the dining table as wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
