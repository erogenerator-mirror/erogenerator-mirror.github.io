Not that he didn't like the show either. In fact, he was very interested in the girl with him. Sure, it wasn't like the guy in his dream was going to be getting it on with her, but she could get him off with a very quick flick of the wrist.</p> <p>It wasn't like the dream was going to be easy either. He wasn't exactly sure how he'd go about it, but somehow the feeling he had of the girl that was being left was turning him on. Not to mention that part of him was looking forward to seeing her, too. He wondered whether the guy in his dream had been in the middle of changing when the girl started talking to him in the midst of the washing, not just out the way, but just to get back to her.</p> <p>"Here, take it." She said. "It could be fun to spend some time alone with a friend who isn't looking to get laid. Let you keep trying."</p> <p>"H-honestly, I don't have anywhere to go. I got here a little bit after we finished up."</p> <p>"I see..." The girl said, smiling a little and raising her hands. "Well, if you could just grab your wallet and the keys to my house, maybe we could do this again... maybe a second time..."</p> <p>"Oh, of course!"</p> <p>While they were talking, the girl had picked up her towel without even being told to and laid it out on the table. She walked over to the bag where she had her keys. "I'm going to call the number for that car wash now. I'll tell you when to turn around and I'll tell you how much." She said before he could tell her that he couldn't turn around. She walked back into the bathroom.</p> <p>John looked at his watch and smiled. "I'll be in the back. We'll see each other again soon."</p> <p>He turned around, walking back toward the door when he heard the girl say, "You gotta hurry."</p> <p>"Hey, what?"</p> <p>"You heard. Get on your knees before you miss. Just a minute." The girl giggled.</p> <p>After a few seconds, she said, "Ok, baby."</p> <p>She leaned in toward him and started kissing his cheek. "You just remember this, okay? If you ever want to fuck her again, give her a call. She's really sweet."</p> <p>John stared at her, his mind reeling. She was just kidding with him. He'd never cheated on anyone and he didn't care. They were friends, he knew that. He didn't know anything that really wouldn't mean that much to her. He couldn't believe that she was just offering to do this to him again in the bathroom, not out in the open right in front of all those people. He really didn't think she knew what she was doing, but he was sure if she really had been giving him a hand job or helping him wash his backside, he could have ended it right there.</p> <p>Then he felt her slide up against his body, her arms going around him. She pulled back slowly. "I'm back," she whispered.</p> <p>"I know, I just thought that maybe maybe you should give me a hand job?"</p> <p>She grinned against his shoulder. "My feet might just stay up all day and I might fall forward if you move."</p> <p>"H-Hurt by my feet?"</p> <p>"Don't think I didn't notice the way you were looking at me when I walked in the washcloth over that towel."</p> <p>"Oh, um, no... I didn't..."</p> <p>She leaned back, her face in his chest. "Well, I'm sure you can. Just don't move." She reached up, put her hands on either side of his face, and held on. "But if I want you to, just do it again... I wanna see you again."</p> <p>John looked around. He didn't know what to think. He just didn't have anything else to say. He felt incredibly uncomfortable, not only with the girl, but also with all the other men in the room as well. It just wasn't fair that some of them were making assumptions that he was being made too. But the way she looked, and she said it, and her voice, and even her body made his heart pound. The way she was holding onto him as if it was his right to touch, and even to be that way in public... He shuddered, the feelings racing through him that he wasn't sure he was capable of.
