Then there were those moments. He spent the whole week with Sam, the four of them going out to dinner every week, hanging out at home with Mary and Robby, getting hammered by the boys in the dorm and then they all were home from school and then he was fucking Mary. But the weekends, in the beginning of it was always the same. The three of them would drive back to his house alone, or he would drive Mary down to her brother's on his way out of town for a convention or something and then she'd come home around the afternoon and fall asleep on and off again, on and off in the living room. And there were a few times when Sam got him alone. But even then he knew when he was having sex with her.</p> <p>He didn't mind it at all. He knew his wife could not make him do that.</p> <p>But in any case, there was this other kind of sex.</p> <p>He didn't notice Samantha, the woman he had fallen in love with after he got dumped Mary. She was only in her early twenties. That, in itself, wasn't too much of a shock. She was pretty, in a very small-town girl, standing about 5'1'', she had a short, wavy, blonde hair, big blue eyes, a big, sultry smile, and she was a really nice girl, very pretty, and very horny. She and she wasn't even wearing panties.</p> <p>"How does it feel, baby?" she grinned in his ear when he sat in the living room.</p> <p>"It feels great," he said. "But what's the difference between having sex with me or not?"</p> <p>"We are not having sex," she responded firmly. "You need to do more of it! It's been ten years since we did anything like that."</p> <p>"And we still are. It's getting late," he said as he rose up to leave.</p> <p>"So, I guess this means that it's settled then... but the question remains, do you or are you still not interested?" she smiled wickedly. "Do you still not really love me, Robbo? I don't know why you do. You're a bit of an introvert in the office, and you are always having trouble, you can tell, you can't say no to anything, you know, not now and then."</p> <p>"I'm not into that!" Robbo protested. "I'm afraid I'm still a virgin, and you'll be worried. I don't know, I guess, I don't even have the time yet, but I want to go there, now!"</p> <p>"I'm sure you'll be satisfied with us having each other," she replied. "Besides, how is Robbo gonna feel about me having sex with you? You better take off the top two buttons of your shirt and then it's all over so the both of you can do the old, and do the young," she emphasized the old, and do both. "That way I can control how things work; there won't be anything you or I don't do together."</p> <p>Robbo's first reaction was to turn red.</p> <p>"No one is going to know," he managed.</p> <p>"There's nothing to be afraid about, and it's so easy and natural," she said, continuing her charade. "It has nothing to do with the fact that you're not interested in us being exclusive to each other. It doesn't mean you love me. It means you want me," she added, leaning forward and kissing him again. "I want you so badly. You said you had some friends in town, so I'm sure we can have some fun," she added, and leaning back into him, she reached down and touched his cock through his pants. "But we don't have any time," she said, taking his hand that she was still rubbing his cock. "I'll show you what I have now!"</p> <p>Samantha undid the buttons of her shirt and, with her back arched, bent over, taking the neck of the garment in her hands. She didn't bother to take off even her little blue bra. She didn't need to be told. She knew she had a beautiful body. She had an incredible looking, sexy figure, and she was very confident.</p> <p>She had only worn jeans when going out with Robbo, but her top was unzipped, and she wasn't wearing a bra, so her little cotton buds were exposed, and then with her eyes closed, she ran her hands down her stomach over her hips and to her bottom. She ran her fingers over the fabric between her legs, toying with her pussy lips, and then slowly pulled it through the hole in her jeans. She didn't bother to pull the waistbandâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
