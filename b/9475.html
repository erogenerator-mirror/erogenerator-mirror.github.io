Mostly I just listened to her, sometimes it's hard listening to her talking so much.</p> <p>Eventually the conversation turned to sex. I always wondered about what she was thinking. When she looked at me with that knowing look, she knew I was getting aroused.</p> <p>"I've never made love before," she said, breaking my reverie, "it was so awkward back then."</p> <p>"I know," I said.</p> <p>"I just got out of the shower," she said, "And I'm wet like this." She took my cock into her hands and started to stroke it as she spoke. "So nice and big."</p> <p>Her words were so soft and caressing, but also full of promise that I started to become more aroused. I looked at the time on my clock and it was nearly seven. I felt incredibly awkward and wanted to go to bed but at the same time I wanted to be able to feel her.</p> <p>"I just wanted to go to sleep," I said.</p> <p>"Oh," she nodded, "then I don't think we'll be able to make it tonight." She leaned closer, "I wish you'd come with me."</p> <p>"I... well... I don't know what comes over me though," I admitted, trying to explain my nervousness.</p> <p>"Well, I've got a feeling we're about the same age and maybe it'll be fun to have you with us," she said. This time she had a smile on her face, "And after today, I don't want to disappoint you."</p> <p>I laughed, "Oh really? That's amazing... I mean you know you're totally..." I trailed off, trying to sound as excited as I could.</p> <p>"I love your honesty," she joked, "And the way you said it makes my pussy throb."</p> <p>I blushed, "Well, it does," I said, "You don't have to... I mean... not when... if you know you'll be able to. I mean... it might be more fun... if you... you know... you got it hard."</p> <p>"I know, baby," she said with a smile, "and I like to show off my body."</p> <p>"Well... okay."</p> <p>"Yes, baby, you'll be able to get hard, even if you think about me." She laughed, "Now don't be too hard on yourself while you're waiting."</p> <p>I laughed.</p> <p>"Okay then."</p> <p>There was a knock at the door. We both broke eye contact.</p> <p>"You're ready," she said.</p> <p>She went to answer the front door then. I turned around to her and took her hand. We stood there as the door swung open and I stepped out. I could feel the wetness from her sex between her legs. It was all I could do to keep from dropping to my knees and burying my face in between her legs.</p> <p>We both leaned on our bellies, not so much embarrassed as embarrassed. She moved out of the way so I could see her. She smiled at me as I stepped forward, and then turned around, offering me her body.</p> <p>I reached out and put my arms around her as we embraced tightly, then kissed her. She pushed herself back, making a noise from deep within as she pressed back into me. Our bodies pressed together and we were moaning loudly. She leaned back even further, making us both moan at the same time. Her tits were pressed against me as I pressed harder into her, and she felt wonderful as well. She broke our embrace before she broke away, and then wrapped herself around me. Our lips parted, and I could feel her warm breath on the front of my lips.</p> <p>Her hand reached down and she rubbed my cock through my jeans. Her eyes closed when she reached to touch, and the feel of her firm hand on my penis made our kiss even more intense. Her other hand found its way down my side, and soon she was rubbing my butt cheeks in the small of my back as she kissed me.</p> <p>"This might be the hottest day of my life," she smiled with a smile, and then she released me, "We should get going. It's after four, and the park closes at five. You can call my mom, and tell her you won't be home that night, that you'reâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
