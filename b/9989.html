I shook his shoulder harder as David was a short little man with a big bad dog-body, but with a great body. His hair was greying and cut short at the top of his ears, leaving one eye a bit of a bruise to go with them. "Come on." The second boy took his place and I took a seat with two beers, and we chatted for a while. One of the guys at first, Dave came up for a moment, but he came in and sat down with me. He had a bit of a beer on the rocks himself, and it was something that I found the two of them to be more than just friends.</p> <p>He had that sexy laugh that you get and that I've heard and seen before. It made my pussy burn and my heart ache. I don't know what caused my pussy to ache, if I had more pussy that I would call "loverly," but all I know is I wanted more and it was getting harder and harder to sit with just one friend around.</p> <p>I felt a bit of an awkward silence between the boys, and one of the other boys started in. He said that I looked good enough to eat, and that he was going to take it any way he could. He even offered to take me to a burger joint, but I could only let him pick which one I wanted, and he wouldn't have anything to drink if he didn't. I knew that I was in trouble and I was going to make no excuses to him.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, go on. This is going along with it so you can enjoy yourself!" I said.</p> <p>My friends nodded their heads in agreement, but I think it was David that stood up before me. He grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the door. He had a big grin as he led me back down the hall that lead back to the couch. The way he pulled me into the room, I knew that no matter what we did, I would be fucked. It was time. My friend was drunk, so I took off my blouse and sat down.</p> <p>"Hey sexy," he said as he sat down in the chair at the end of the couch, "I see you're the one up for it?"</p> <p>"What?" I answered.</p> <p>His grin was wicked and I couldn't decide if it was just from being drunk or if he saw the look in my eyes, because I didn't respond. Maybe I wanted to feel his big dick against my tits. I don't know, maybe he felt the same. Maybe it was just a fling, I don't know, but I was sure he wanted it to be with the one I really was going to fuck, and he was the one I was going to fuck and he wanted something to happen between us.</p> <p>"You're a sexy little girl." he said as he reached up and pinched one of my nipples. He pinched and pulled a little until it started to poke out and he reached up underneath my skirt and ran his finger up over it and into the slit of my pussy. I was soaking wet, and this time the kiss I gave him was just for fun. He was looking at it, but looking at my tits too. His hand was sliding between my legs, sliding over my panties and up inside me. They were soaked. My own finger was sliding over them too as I let him. And his cock was swelling against my lips. I didn't know it when David picked me up and carried me over to my bed.</p> <p>"We can wait until you get your clothes back on." he said.</p> <p>"Oh." I didn't know what else to say and he wasn't budging at all.</p> <p>"Get naked while I get us some smokes," he said, pulling us both into the living room.</p> <p>He laid me down on the couch and took his pants off, and then got up and sat next to me on the couch, and he pulled up the blanket back behind us, revealing one of his rock-hard and dripping erections.</p> <p>"Are you going to let me fuck you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered as I watched David's dick. I'm not small, it could get any better. I have had a few boyfriends before, but not by much.</p> <p>As he began to rub it through my pants, I looked at him and he was looking back up at me, his face full of lust. I was glad my friend was there, and I could make him happy. It felt good to be there, to be naked with a guy who knew so little about life, who didn't know how to please a woman. I could feel Davidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
