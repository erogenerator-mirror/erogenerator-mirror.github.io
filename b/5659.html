He reached around with both hands and cupped her firm, ample rear and slid his finger under the edge of her panties, gently probing her pussy through the thin covering. His fingers felt the silky heat and heat of her sex as he probed and massaged the tender skin. His fingers were wet with her dew and he slipped a finger between her lips and slowly pushed into her as he continued to finger-fuck his girl friend, causing her to push back against him.</p> <p>"You are just so goddamn fucking hot," he breathed as he again began to move his fingers in and out of her pussy. His hips began to move as her mouth, now moving from his shoulders with her lips brushing against and kissing his chest, was again locked between them. His hands continued to move in and out of her pussy as she rubbed her body against him, and he could feel her hands gripping the outside of his legs as well as his lower half, as if she felt his hardness in her fingers. He was in seventh heaven, lost in the bliss of her touch. His fingers continued to work her pussy as it was wet and sticky and engorged by her excitement and he could almost imagine reaching down and pushing his fingers into her as she orgasmed, but he decided, now that she was ready, to see what he would do for her. She would be up for anything and he would oblige her. He rose to his feet still leaning against the desk, and walked over to the side nearest the door, slipping a hand between her legs to cup her breast as she lifted her bottom up slightly to make it easier to stroke her pussy.</p> <p>She looked up and, still on her knees, was surprised that he had taken his shoes off so quickly, so quickly, and it hadn't taken her to move her legs apart as she expected, and then there was a sudden jerk as his weight suddenly landed on her. She jumped and looked down as he held his shaft up against her face. His hands were still on her breasts, her legs around his hips, and both of them were facing her and back. "What the fuck did you do that for?" A look of shock came over her face, and she felt her cheeks flush in shame. He wasn't mad. She was about to get fucked like the slut she had been. It was just another one of his fantasies, nothing more. She could do it, but it was going to be more. She didn't know much about it either, but he did, all too well. It had been a mistake having him look down on her like that, she remembered. What had she done? she asked herself, although she already knew the answer as he pushed himself back up and began to turn her upper body again.</p> <p>His right knee landed between her thighs and his left knee pressed against her front, his leg still between hers, allowing her to move her own legs back to meet hers, allowing him better access to her sex. The moment his cock head slid into her, there was a flood of warmth and wetness. He pushed himself back towards her and, as she raised her back towards him, he slipped inside her again, sliding his cock through the slickened folds of her sex, sliding a single finger back into her wetness. His cock moved slightly as he did so, the feeling of her pussy sliding along it as it filled her, his cock head against her clit, felt as though it were sliding down the length of a narrow sliver of a tunnel. She couldn't quite feel how her own clit was sliding along his length, it seemed as though it was only pressing against his head. But her arousal grew. When her back arched and she pushed back against his thigh as he began to thrust his hips, he slowly began to lift himself up and down, sliding his cock around the slick walls of her sopping pussy. She almost came right there, her whole body shuddered as he began to ride her, his weight pressing with him as he rose and sank back down, his balls pressed against her. Her body writhed against his, her hips trying to pull him into herself as they rode him. She was in his hands, her eyes closed, her face flushed, her mouth moving against his as he lifted himself upwards, each movement he made as he impaled her, each insertion of his cock deeper and deeper, feeling the heat of her sex and feeling the silkiness of his body against hers as it slid up and down. She began to rub her crotch against his thigh, the friction making her entire body tingle as it rubbed against him, the softness of her breasts against his legs and the warmth of them on his skin.</p> <p>Suddenly, she realized that she was in the same room with him and he had lifted himself up so that they were lookingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
