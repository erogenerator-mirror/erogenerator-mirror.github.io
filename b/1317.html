I was sure that if I had not made it to the pool by that time, I'd have been in awe of her beauty.</p> <p>She stood there, looking a bit shy to me, and then smiled, "I thought you weren't going to join us." She began to pull off her tiniest bikini top and I could see all the white triangles of fabric as it fell over her nipples, and even more as she tossed it in my direction. Her nipples were rock hard and I couldn't get over them, being able to only stare at them for a few seconds before my attention was drawn back to her as she bent over to take off her bikini bottom and let it drop on the ground.</p> <p>I sat down in the diving platform and admired her body, and even more so when she looked up at me. She was gorgeous. The lightest hair, which normally, in my experience, came from between the legs. The dark triangle hid all of the perfect curves of her body from my eyes, and yet her stomach had the tell-tale roundness of a woman who was on a rigorous diet. She had the hips of a young woman with a few extra pounds, and her stomach was toned without being skinny. My face started to grow tired of the day's events as I started to think that perhaps we had already gotten past the beginning of what lay ahead.</p> <p>"Hey," I heard from behind me, making me turn to see Lizzy sitting, her body covered by a light beach cover up, the same one that showed no sign of bikini bottoms. It was pretty obvious that the top was a thong; a very skimpy little thing, but it was obvious that she was not wearing a shirt. "Don't tell me that we're going to swim naked right here!" I said, my voice a bit of a high five, and Lizzy made the first move looking over all of us. This caught me by surprise, and I started to think she was going to leave, but that changed when Lizzy bent over and picked up the cover up, "Well, come in here and join us; then join us for a nice swim!" she said in a voice that was sexy as hell. Now, it's not that I'm not attracted to women, it's just, well, she was a really big, hot woman in my book. Her body looked good enough to eat. But I was still a virgin. She could have just kissed me or made me lick her, but that wasn't what she came and got naked with, and what I saw when I was in the shallow end of the swimming pool got my mind racing. She was wearing a pink bikini bottom, and she kept moving toward me. It might have been the fact that it was the first time that I'd had the chance to see her naked in close up, but it was the whole experience.</p> <p>Lizzy reached behind her and pulled her panties to the side, letting them drop to the ground in one motion, "Nice! I could just sit by you for the next ten minutes, I could even swim nude!" she said, "But I do like to be out of the way!" she added, and with that she leaned back and moved onto her back, laying on her side as she looked up at me.</p> <p>I thought that I was going to cum in my underpants as soon as I saw her naked body, but it was hard to know how far it was going to go. Here, on the day we had the best times together as a couple. We would go on dates, we'd go to movies, there was usually at least one of us in the room when it was the two of us. And we enjoyed sex, especially when there was no pressure involved. She had been married to a man, which was true, but her husband, a very wealthy woman, had taken a real liking to her since they'd first met a few years before. They had dated for a few years before she even had a boyfriend. She told me at our first marriage, as we fell in love at first sight, "I feel like I've just been introduced to a whole new world of sexuality; you feel comfortable in the moment, I'm free in the moment."</p> <p>That is the story of my first year of marriage. When I first started with Lizzy, we didn't have much in common. She was a little bigger, but her small little body was quite attractive. She had large dark brown eyes that looked really beautiful to me. When we met her, she got the attention that many a men would pay to watch her naked ass move as she walked from the beach to the house.
