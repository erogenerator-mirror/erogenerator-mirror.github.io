We were both still nude while lying down on either side of one another. "She's very pretty," I say with a knowing smile.</p> <p>I put my arm around her waist as she snuggled up closer to me. "What's so special about her?"</p> <p>"She's young," I say, with a broad smile. A few more minutes of silence and we both knew the answer. And we agreed.</p> <p>"She was a tomboy," I whispered back, with a big grin.</p> <p>"I don't want to get ahead of myself, so can't say we're still sisters. She didn't seem too happy about her boyfriend's name at school and even had a hard time catching up with her," I added. I wasn't trying to hide anything, but I felt it was a bit awkward that I didn't mention the guy. That seemed to have cooled my nerves away for a bit.</p> <p>"No, not at all. I like boys too and she seems kind of nice. But no more kissing, okay?" I said, giving her a little shove before she rolled me onto my back, but didn't attempt to move into me.</p> <p>"I'm okay with that," she said, and I saw a little fear in her eyes. I couldn't help but notice that her body seemed to be reacting quite nicely to being touched.</p> <p>"Does this make you nervous?" I asked.</p> <p>She took her right hand from her chest and reached down to run her hand through my hair and then put her finger in my mouth. Our eyes kept locked on each other, and our breathing got heavier. Her hand on my cock moved a little faster, but wasn't pushing me into her. I closed my eyes, and enjoyed the sensation.</p> <p>"I don't want you to feel embarrassed," she whispered, and started to kiss the tip of my cock. Her lips felt soft on me and I immediately felt aroused by her touch. She kissed her middle finger and slid it slowly up and down my shaft.</p> <p>"You're very hard," she said between sucks, and then licked the head of my cock. I felt my legs get weak and almost give way as she slid my cock in her mouth. She was going slow, taking her time, but with each suck she would take a little more of me in and her head would bump.</p> <p>I just wanted to fuck her mouth as hard as I could, but that was probably not her goal and she would have lost interest. This was a first for both of us. She was inexperienced at blowjobs, and I think she was afraid of what I would do if I was going to try to shove my cock down her throat. The thought sent another thrill through me.</p> <p>I pulled her up close and we were both breathing hard now. My erection had subsided, but she still had that warm feeling in her. She was still naked, but I could feel something stirring in her. We were both hot and excited and needed to have sex, but it would only be right if we were the only two. But just looking at her made me feel so sexy, so I didn't care if I was the only one.</p> <p>Suddenly I felt her breasts pressed against my chest and our faces were inches apart. I put my hands on her ass and helped her move into me. I could feel the bulge of her pussy against me through her panties. She slowly moved herself up and down on top of me, feeling my erection, getting it up against her.</p> <p>We kissed, deeply, tentatively, but she kept up the same pace, sliding my cock between her lips. It was the first time I'd ever touched or penetrated a woman in a sexual way. She was getting really wet, and I began to thrust my hips gently at her, trying to get it in her. I put my hands on her butt and pulled her harder to me.</p> <p>Suddenly, her hand slipped under the hem of my shorts and found my throbbing erection. She began to stroke me with her finger on her thumb as we made out. The heat, the softness of her hand, it was all sending more blood rushing down to my cock. I reached around her shoulder and found those sexy breasts in her bikini. I reached one hand around her back and cupped her left breast, moving my other hand under her bikini top to feel the softness of her naked skin.</p> <p>We kissed harder, each of us working our lips deeper each time. Her free hand found my balls and I felt they might be even tighter. It wasn't too intense. It was more of an exploration. The fact that she was moving so softly against me made it more erotic. Her hand on my cock now was just as good as her mouth and tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
