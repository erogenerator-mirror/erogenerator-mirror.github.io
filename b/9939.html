"And so it's all right with you."</p> <p>"You're getting older honey."</p> <p>"Really? It's fine." "Well thanks for it," I said and took my seat beside her.</p> <p>She looked at me for a minute and then pulled a pen out of her bra and wrote my name on her stomach.</p> <p>"Oh no you don't," I told her. "I was supposed to come in your bra but the way you were lying on your back and the way you were smiling at the camera... it's obvious just how much you're enjoying this. I'm not going to try and find another film to pass my eyes on," I finished as she smiled.</p> <p>She read the note again and smiled then asked a question. I was already nervous about this conversation even though it had only become more intense with each passing moment but her question just added to the excitement.</p> <p>"Well that's just great," she told me. "I was curious about it as it's hard to pass it off as a film to some other people."</p> <p>"Oh no! You're not even old then!" I lied. "If I were 20 you'd just be doing what I'm really looking forward to do!" I smiled.</p> <p>"Maybe it's wrong if you've been watching porn," she said. "But I'm hoping the thought of watching it will put you out of your daze just a little bit," she told me.</p> <p>I was stunned; not only had we talked about porn earlier but she knew me so well. I was confused by her words and when I looked at her, she held me. Her smile never left her face as our eyes connected and her eyes were full of love and commitment as I held her.</p> <p>"It's just a film, so there's no harm to you, I swear it, so... how are you now? Is there any way you'll be staying here for a whole month?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nope," I said feeling her breasts pressing against my arm as we sat in a booth with her. "I'll be doing this every night and tomorrow," I told her as her hand slid around to my crotch.</p> <p>Her smile was wide as her fingers closed around my cock. I felt my mind turn to the porn films she had caught of a woman and her hand, which had been playing on my cock since we sat down. There was no way I could make it to the next movie. I looked at her and told her that it would be okay.</p> <p>"Okay, come sit with me. I'm trying to learn as much as I think," I told her as she helped me from my chair. She leaned over me and slowly undid my top button while her fingers toyed with mine. She looked into my eyes from under black eyeliner as her hand slid its way up in front of my chest so I wasn't thinking with my heart.</p> <p>We found a parking lot at a nearby park and got out our trays of the usual stuff. She took my hand and led me out of the bookstore and to a waiting car. I had to wait long before we could reach the car.</p> <p>"Wait here," she said as the door finally closed behind us, "my parents are expecting me."</p> <p>I waited a moment before my head tilted back to look at her. She was dressed in a dark blue dress with a halter top that showed off her full breasts and the lower curve of her breasts that had gone with her old clothes.</p> <p>She held my hand the moment we reached the car. I had to keep my eyes open while waiting for the car to cool down. I saw her smile even as it took me a couple minutes to get my bearings and get to my car. She stepped in and shut the door while I was leaning against it as we drove into the parking lot.</p> <p>After we got out of the car, she leaned over and kissed me full on the lips. I could feel her tongue exploring. Before I knew what was happening, she pulled me out of my vehicle and on the way inside, we walked up to my door.</p> <p>Once inside, she turned around just as an older woman who was staring at me like I was too good a young woman not to look up at me. She had a small smile on her lips and her eyes were looking me over, which I've come to assume means that she was impressed. Her hand went to my chest and she pulled me to her as she wrapped her arms around my waist. The moment she had me inside her she gave out a small moan and then we had our kiss.</p> <p>When her lips separated and our breath mingled, I was in the moment. I stood there trembling because I had never been kissed beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
