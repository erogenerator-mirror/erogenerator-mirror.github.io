We have so much going on. You always had some kind of family, I guess. Where's Julie?"</p> <p>"She's in the bathroom," I said. I put on some T-shirt. Julie will come and go. If you want she can go home herself. But stay a little while with us."</p> <p>Julie returned. "Sorry, but my parents aren't home and I wanted to come see you."</p> <p>We sat there quietly for a while. Then Julie asked "Would you like some wine?" I said no. She fetched two glasses and brought them to me and we sat down. She went and got some wine and went to the bathroom. She came back to the room just for a moment and sat down next to me. I put my arm around her and we held each other for some time. Then she suddenly jumped up and jumped in my arms.</p> <p>She was kissing me and I started to kiss her back. And we kissed some and fondled each other some more. "You are so beautiful," I told her. "I really miss your kisses." She lifted her face and I kissed her lips. "But we mustn't."</p> <p>This time she was kissing me. After a while we came up for air. Her top was torn and she said she's been looking forward to my kisses all evening. We kissed some more. Julie said she missed my lips and it felt good to tell me, too.</p> <p>She asked me to go take her to bed. I went through the house, made the bed, got some blankets and a pillow and went back out. The kitchen was empty for some time, no lights on. There, Julie had poured some wine and stood by the bedroom door and lit a cigarette. I came over and she said "That kiss felt so good, when you kiss me."</p> <p>"Julie," I said, "we need to talk about my job."</p> <p>"Of course we do, you're a wonderful boss, and all so exciting to work for." "But that could go very bad. What's you and Julie going to do after Julie leaves?"</p> <p>"Oh, I think you know. There's lots of work to do. We're both free, we can do what we want." Julie giggled. "After all we're free, don't you want to live and love each other?" I didn't answer a question she was making, but I did kiss her lips a little. "Now," I said, "I have to go and clean myself up, too."</p> <p>"Oh! That's fantastic! But you're not going to bed with me again?"</p> <p>"No, I mean I've already kissed you, so why don't you take off your top and sit on the bed and wait a while while while you say 'goodnight' to me?"</p> <p>Julie got up and, still on her back, slowly turned around. It took her a few minutes to get to her knees. Once she got on the bed she bent over and looked at me. "How does this make you feel? I love how excited you are making me." With that she sat back and asked me to get undressed. I undressed as I was sitting on the bed, and before I could stand straight she was on the bed. Just before she got on her back, she said "I want you." She kissed me very sweetly. Then she whispered to me "When I'm ready I want you to take off my panties too. They're just like panties and they're wet because we haven't been kissing, you shouldn't make me wait any longer."</p> <p>I got off the bed to get her. She stood as I was on the floor. She put her arms around the waist of my shorts and said "I want you in me so badly!" Then she took my cock into her arms, and then she kissed me while I kissed her. Her kissing and her kisses made my cock even more stiff at this point. She was already on her back and I climbed between her legs as I knelt between them. My cock was already at attention, and when she started to caress it with one hand, I pulled her with me. She kept her legs open like she wanted me to and I put my cock into her ready and willing body. She didn't go on, just let me put in more and more of her. I was soon inside her again. She said she could feel my heart beating a little faster at this point.</p> <p>We came together in that moment, and I kissed her again. Then we were lying on our sides. I said "Julie, it must be so exciting for you to have me so intimately."</p> <p>"Yes I am. And I loved it when you kissed me like that," and she kissed me againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
