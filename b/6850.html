"That's all right, honey. I could stay up all night. I've got things on my mind. I've got plenty of time. You and me?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess. I'm glad you're here with me."</p> <p>I pulled Linda toward the stairs and we walked toward the bedroom. The lights were off and we could see lights in the living room and the guest bedroom. Linda said, "I didn't mean to interrupt you."</p> <p>"No, not much. You're very kind to me. Don't you remember?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I remember. But, oh so romantic!" She reached out and stroked my hand. And then she leaned forward. Our lips touched. The softness of the lips against mine was magical. When we broke the kiss, Linda leaned back and smiled at me. "You know, I like to kiss you, too. You're a sweet kisser, too. You don't have to be a lot of work in my life. But right now, I want more than you know." She grinned wickedly. "I think, just one more kiss, and we'll be all right."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded. "I'd love to."</p> <p>Linda reached behind her and unhooked the halter on the back of her halter and slid it off her shoulders, the straps sliding off her shoulders. The halter fell away from her breasts, leaving Linda's magnificent breasts for my view. Linda's breasts were, as always, full, round and firm and her nipples were erect. This time, though, there was no denying that they were big and very erect. Linda gently stroked both of the engorged nipples with her fingers.</p> <p>"Oh, my, I love that. They feel so good." Then she sat back and pulled me to her. She rubbed the palm of her hand across my chest, cupping both breasts. They quickly responded to her ministrations. Then, holding me close with one arm, she sat back and said, "Come on. Time to get my clothes off. What are we watching on TV?"</p> <p>I helped pull off my shirt and then my pants. As soon as I shed my shoes, I was in her arms again. Linda pushed my shirt up and over my shoulders. I kicked off my pants, and she pushed me onto my back. She stood, then took off her shoes and socks. She knelt between my legs, her eyes looking up my body. With a grin, she raised her face to my groin, her hands fumbling with my loincloth. Slowly, she pulled each leg out, sliding it lower until she was sitting on it and straddling me. Once I was fully exposed, she raised her face again. It was a tender look, the expression of a woman who loved to pleasure her self.</p> <p>"Kiss me, Linda."</p> <p>Linda leaned forward, her hands still on my thighs, and kissed me, her tongue tasting my skin as the skin it touched was the most sensitive of my parts. When I felt her lips caress my nipples, my cock grew even larger. "Kiss me again!" she repeated. So did I, kissing her back.</p> <p>"Kiss me down here!" she repeated. "Kiss me down there! Oh, God, you're so good at that!"</p> <p>I did as I was told, and she lifted herself off of me at last, pulling my loincloth down and off of my hips. I lifted my head so she could get it off of me, then, following closely with my hands, she turned toward me, her body standing right in front of my face. My lips parted, ready to take her. She was waiting. And, God, how did she wait for me! A slight pressure, at first, as her legs parted. But then, after a long moment, pleasure was overtaking everything and everyone else as she wrapped them around me, pulling, spreading me. And soon, the feeling of her lips on mine was enough to get me going. I wrapped my arms around her, my hands holding her back and my legs locking together. I kissed that hot, sexy mouth. And she kissed all around my mouth, as if she was going to let me take the lead on that journey to her clit.</p> <p>But she turned me down, turning me towards her breasts. In the end, I lay, almost unable to believe I was doing this, lying underneath a woman whose breasts I loved in me. But now, my excitement increased, and I was just getting started. Slowly, Linda eased me forward, until I was on my hands and knees. She had me in her hands, and she moved into position. I lifted myself up, then leaned backwards, feeling her position as she reachedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
