I replied.</p> <p>'It's ok if you feel it.'</p> <p>'I'd rather we had sex.' I said.</p> <p>I felt an intense tingle run up my spine as I sat there, looking into her eyes. I could see the real feelings coursing through every fibre of her lovely body.</p> <p>I leaned to kiss her. Her lips parted to accept the kiss I offered. The passion in the kiss was electrifying. She tasted as amazing as I could imagine. I could feel a tiny trickle of lust begin to run up my spine as I opened her mouth to receive the softness from her lips.</p> <p>Sasha reached up to run her hands through my red locks and hold me as we kissed. Slowly, lovingly. I moved one hand to find her breast and caress it gently. Her nipple was hard and a tight little pebble on top of her breast that seemed to have been crying so hard when we had been doing that kissing. I found it and gently twisted, stretching the nipple between my thumb and forefinger and she cried out in lust.</p> <p>I felt my breathing quicken as we held each other. I slowly released and lifted my hand until it found the hot moistness of her sex. It was slick and a perfect match with her swollen lips between her thighs. I slid my fingers down her slick lips until they came to her entrance and pushed them in gently. She was completely relaxed and dripping wet as I slid my middle finger deep inside her. Her fingers had found my stiff cock and she was stroking it slowly as I fingered her slowly.</p> <p>I felt her hand reach down to part her moist lips and find my cock. She slowly slid my cock out of hers and she took it in her hand and stroked it gently as she moved it back and forth. I felt her hand moving up and down her wet lips. She looked into my eyes, I knew that I had only wanted her as a little thing so I didn't feel guilty. Her eyes had a glow of desire as her fingers stroked my cock, her head lowered and her tongue moved out and kissed me.</p> <p>She moved her hand up and down my shaft slowly but firmly. She was driving me crazy. I couldn't wait to enter her, wanted to be filled with her tightness.</p> <p>'Do you want to make love to me?' she asked softly.</p> <p>'Are you sure you aren't a virgin?'' I asked.</p> <p>'No, I'm really nervous. I didn't get to know you well enough to say I was a virgin back then.</p> <p>'Please don't be nervous.'</p> <p>'Do you want to come inside me?''</p> <p>'Yes...very much' We both whispered, looking deeply into each others eyes. I leaned into her and kissed her. As her hand began moving up and down my stiff cock I slowly pushed down on her lower back, causing her to lift up slightly so I could enter her. I entered her inch by inch. I stopped for a moment, and almost pulled back, waiting for her reaction. She was so warm and she felt so good to me.</p> <p>I looked at her in the eye and slid my hands up her legs stopping at her knees and slowly slid more out so I was just on her upper thigh. She placed her hand over mine, holding me tight, as I moved my hips back.</p> <p>'It hurt when I opened my legs, but not much really. I'll be ok.'</p> <p>'Just stay put, I wont mind.' I said.</p> <p>'Are you sure?' she asked, biting her lips.</p> <p>'Yes, it will be better if I lay next to you, I like a girl to be right next to someone else.'</p> <p>That sounded wonderful to me. I looked down at her smiling face as she lay on her side with me still on my side, both of us looking at each other intently. I wondered to our mutual attraction and if it looked as good as it would tomorrow night.</p> <p>Slowly, tentatively, Sasha leaned next to me. I could feel her hot breathe on my neck as her hand cupped my face and her kiss deepened between her lips, her body moved against mine, causing a warm feeling to spread up and down my abdomen.</p> <p>It had always felt that my penis could slide into her body easily and then push right into her love canal but we had never had sex so much. My fingers slipped down in between her legs to feel the warmth of her, feel the softness of her body as we sat opposite each others.</p> <p>'You are very warm.' I said softly.</p> <p>Sasha looked so beautiful lying there, with her eyes closed and her face in shadow.
