He wasn't sure if it was from her or him, but he knew it couldn't be. He knew what she had felt like this afternoon and what she had felt like this evening. They couldn't be doing this all over. If they were doing this, their love for each other, that was all they both needed.</p> <p>He pushed the door open and took her in his arms.</p> <p>"I love you." She pulled the hem of her skirt up. She pulled it further up; her panties were on the end of his prick, as he pulled down on her hips to bring her to him.</p> <p>"I love you too, dear."</p> <p>"I'm glad to be of service," she said, but before she could say another word, he pulled her onto her knees and then forced his prick back into his jeans. She knew then she could say anything and say more without his knowing.</p> <p>"Let's go inside and have a shower," she said, moving the water and turning off the faucet. She had to stand up. She was too weak standing.</p> <p>"I don't want anyone to see me like this."</p> <p>She tried to pull off her dress, but she couldn't get it fastened. As she stood, she could see the white bra that covered her breasts.</p> <p>"You're lucky it's still wet."</p> <p>"It's not wet. It's covered." She tried to push him up to the shower room or the shower, but she knew that they were going far away. Her back was against a wall, trying to stand up. He was holding her tight. He had wrapped the towel around her breasts which had a lovely lace effect.</p> <p>"Come on."</p> <p>He was standing outside of the shower when she moved to sit on the stool to dry her legs.</p> <p>"No. My feet? Here. Here. Let me dry my legs."</p> <p>She knew she was blushing. He had wanted her to let him dry her legs, and now he had.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "but first I want some water."</p> <p>"And water?"</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"It'll be my pleasure." He held her by the knees and walked her to the bathroom. He put the water on the wall, filled two glasses, and poured some in the other.</p> <p>"You do know that I don't have a sponge," he said.</p> <p>She knew that if he washed her, there would be no need for a shower. She had told him. It was just a matter of the water, what the soap did to the skin.</p> <p>When he finished washing her, she said, "Let me clean it." He stood up and started to wash himself. He turned off the water in the shower.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this?" she asked. He nodded and said, "Yes."</p> <p>She turned the shower off and they had the cold water on each other. She looked into his eyes, kissed him softly, said, "I'll be there in a minute."</p> <p>The water was warm and she felt it trickle over her face and down her chest. It turned her on. She knew that the smell of him was there also. It aroused her. She felt a warm flush coming on her face.</p> <p>In a small cubicle, he dried her hair, using his hands and face cloths. Then he put some gel into his hands and began to rub it across her body with his hands, over her nipples and down her stomach. She was leaning against the wall. The water beat into her hand, and her nipples ached. He was washing her face with his hands, covering her entire body in the warm oil of his hands. He looked at her eyes and saw something special in them.</p> <p>"You look so beautiful," he said. She opened her mouth; she wanted to kiss him, but he had other ideas. He pulled her to him and they kissed.</p> <p>"How do you taste?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't have a mouth. I do have lips."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>"Are you my first?" He reached up, pinched her nipples, leaned to kiss her.</p> <p>His lips touched. It felt like fire to her. She felt as if the moment had come. As it had earlier that first evening she had spent in their bedroom, his mouth had kissed her. And when they kissed, she felt her mouth getting full of fire.</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>They made love like that for many hours, kissing and touching each other. Their kisses were long, wild, passionate.
