She had to make herself a little shorter. "This can't work. There's no easy way on how to handle a man."</p> <p>Caleb looked over at the desk. "I think. There's a way I don't know, Ms. Walker, but I'm sure you'll find it out."</p> <p>"I know. But it makes me feel like I'm being hunted." She smiled. "Are you sure you didn't hear me ask you for more?"</p> <p>"Sure, Ms. Walker." But what about you, Caleb? Where is it going? You haven't looked in your file yet." The detective sat back down with his elbows tucked under his chin, as if to rest his chin, which wasn't very well. He did seem a little more nervous than a normal detective, especially when it came to girls.</p> <p>"Caleb. Why don't you walk with me over to where my desk is? We can watch a little TV, get to know each other a little better."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>He stood up and walked over to his desk, and she followed after. She put her hands on his shoulders, but he didn't pull away. Instead, he lifted his head and met her gaze, taking a moment to get the message across before kissing her cheek softly, then he kissed her on the lips, then turned to get some rest on all fours with the detective on his back.</p> <p>"Caleb."</p> <p>"Yes?" Her voice, as if it was his normal, everyday routine from the first meeting we had to set up her interview to the first session, now she was here to interview her lover, to be the next test.</p> <p>"Just go with me. I want this meeting to be as exciting and passionate as possible. So, let's go on out this office here." Caleb didn't bother to try to hide his disappointment, as he turned back to walk over to his desk. He'd need to start packing more paperwork. He might have to call in sick to deal with his new lover. For years. But for now, he just walked with her.</p> <p>As they walked back to the desk, Caleb looked over at the desk. "That should take care of that."</p> <p>"Thank you," she said smiling.</p> <p>"Now, since this won't be your last meeting, if you don't mind, we'll just call in a bit early if we can't get you ready." He took the paper and sat back down.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, taking a few more notes. "How does this work?"</p> <p>"Pretty standard."</p> <p>"So what's the problem?" She said, with that big smile again.</p> <p>"It's complicated but I can explain. The issue is your first question," he said, with a knowing smile, looking at her.</p> <p>"Caleb. If you're trying to get me to call you my lover, it should tell me. I thought we agreed." She was starting to feel like a little girl again. Caleb might be an old man, but he was young enough. There was nothing going on behind her. "But we may need to get you ready."</p> <p>With that, Caleb took out a file on a sheet of charcoal, and placed it on top of it. "There is no doubt. It's an eye-for-the-door interview in the first three months of our relationship." He went to the file and came back. "I'll give you a little sample." He walked over, putting his hand on her shoulder, which made her freeze.</p> <p>"Is you sure we'll be okay?" Her heart raced, and it was getting warmer. Caleb turned to look at her, which made for some uncomfortable staring, and she just had to look at him.</p> <p>"I'm sure," he said, "but we'll talk about that some more later."</p> <p>He sat back down, and started his computer. "I think that I'll be a little confused if you don't do your research for me." When he looked over at her, she stood up, and walked over to him, then sat down on his lap. "This is all so new, Caleb. I've never been as shocked by women as being interviewed so early. I mean I've heard of it, but never really known the right words to use. But this is all so different. I think you deserve a little privacy."</p> <p>"Privacy?" She smiled. "You mean that I've got to be the third woman in this interview. Not only that, but there are others in here, too."</p> <p>"That's right." He was looking over her shoulder, almost shyly, as he said so.
