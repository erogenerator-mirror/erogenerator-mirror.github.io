We would occasionally get caught up on life in the city, even the movies he found on TV and other amusements like "How Did I Ever Tell You To Go Get Your Phone?", so there wasn't a lot of conversation.</p> <p>On these times, I usually had a boyfriend or at least friend over and he'd get me drunk. We would spend the entire day doing different things, especially when it was the party of the year. It was kind of a back yard affair and I loved having his best friend on the other side of the pool so we would always get into each other's hair, or do our own nasty things together, and all things that were fun. As he was on the other side of the pool, I would lie there with my head on his thigh watching the other people around the pool. We would usually fool around some, but the main activity was with the other friends for as far as I remember.</p> <p>On this particular night, we had spent most of the day in there with our friends. I was lying there as usual, not being in control of myself at all, and felt like I had control over myself at home and it wasn't me with control. I felt like I was the one in control. My self-control was about to be broken.</p> <p>I had thought that we had a great time, but my mind had always been on the sex and sex. I knew that I could do this so I thought that since he wasn't feeling me right now, I would just get him ready for round two. I reached up and lightly stroked his chest. He didn't even flinch, he just smiled at me and then he reached up and started playing with the small of my back.</p> <p>Before I knew it, it was time for round two, I felt his hand creep up my butt, he ran it down under my skirt, I didn't mind doing that, but I had never let a man in there before. There wasn't some sort of rule. I guess you could call it a learning experience, but I always wanted my boyfriend to be the first man to ever touch my pussy...</p> <p>I looked around the backyard as I pulled my skirt up over my hips. He was now stroking my thigh, sliding his hand all the way down to my leg. I looked all around as I could see all the other people around the pool and I just couldn't look away. The only thing I could think about was the fact that what I was doing was so naughty and so hot. He was the only one who hadn't done that, and when I saw a big guy coming up to us and saying hi, I just said "hi" and ran my fingers down to his groin and grabbed his cock through his swim shorts. I pulled him out and started rubbing my hand up and down on his cock, "I'm glad you enjoyed that so much; I've wanted this for a long time." I kissed his lips "Thank you for letting me play with you, we are going to do this again soon," and walked off to the bedroom. I thought I saw someone come up and say to him to come on back to me.</p> <p>I had to go into the pool the next night and when I came in to find the guy on the patio and the door opened, I realized that he had seen me come in. Without a word, I started to go get my bikini while he just kept looking at my legs. He didn't say a word but walked over to me saying "Hi" in a low voice. I stopped in front of him and said "Hello" and reached out and put my hand on his neck. His eyes moved down, but he didn't say a word; I felt compelled to say something to make his cock stir in his swimsuit.</p> <p>I continued to stroke his shoulder under his robe, slowly moving it up and down. I then reached over and grabbed his penis through his underwear. He leaned back in the chair with his hands still in the air. I slowly moved my hand further up his stomach, over his chest and finally to the side of his face. He didn't say a word. I grabbed his hand and placed it back on my breast. He gently started to squeeze my breast under my top. I stopped my stroking and he pulled his hand off. He looked at me and said "This is your house, it's your own." That made me so hot that I stood up and led him towards the pool deck. I pulled him off the chair and onto the deck, sat on the edge and spread my legs open. He got his swim trunks off and sat down beside me. He just stared at me.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
