Now that he is in me, I can feel what your cum feels like as it squirts from deep inside me. And that's as far as anything he ever gets from me."</p> <p>Then she told me that she had to go get some sleep, because they had a little problem. I was too embarrassed to even ask her where was she going. She asked me to stay, and we kissed, and I saw her head disappear behind a stack of pillows. When she reached the bathroom she was standing next to the door, looking at it. "I need to come up with a reason why I can't stay here." And I could tell she didn't believe me. I heard her rummaging through her bag again, and then she said "Get in here and help me clean up." As I turned around, she leaned in and said "I'm sorry, but I can't do this, not alone."</p> <p>I didn't have much of a chance to argue, I had just left the bedroom and she was just standing there looking at me. She knew I had been listening, I saw her pick some tissues up off the sink and put them in her purse. She turned to me, walked to me, kissed me softly on the mouth, and said "I know you said I can, and I'll try."</p> <p>"No. I will probably come back and ruin it somehow."</p> <p>"No. I think you really want to."</p> <p>"Do you mind? Just come back here, and help me clean up."</p> <p>She took my hand and led me into the bathroom. When she turned to put the water on, she leaned down and kissed me again. When she released me she said "This shouldn't take long," and she led me back into the bedroom. I watched as she got dressed. When she was dressed, she told me to lie back. She was standing behind me, pressing her breasts against my back. I could feel the tips of her nipples brushing the bare flesh of my ass, and that was only a mild shock to me.</p> <p>She slid her hands down, lifted them to my face, put them together, and pulled my face to hers. I felt those soft lips on mine, and this was the first hint of what was to come. Her hands slid down my back to my ass, where they rested for a moment, and then they slid back up again. Her lips broke the kiss, and I felt the brush of their tongues come into contact. "Mmm," she breathed into my ear, "I want those." She slid her hands under my shirt, and rubbed them over my skin where they had just been. She lifted her shirt over her head, and I slid it up her arms, as she had done to me, and off her. When my eyes met hers, they moved down to her nipples, which I saw in their own skin, pebble-like as they were. I felt a tremor run through her body, because they were like the tips of two thumbs, and it made her all shivery.</p> <p>Her lips slid down the side of my face, to my cheek, then took my earlobe in her mouth, and sucked lightly. Her hands slid down to my chest, and her fingers began massaging the flesh that her lips had just been making. When she put her mouth back over mine, I felt her tongue touch my bottom lip, just as my mouth opened. With its tip, her tongue darted in and out of my mouth, and it was such a thrill that I never wanted it to end. Then, just as quickly as it started, it ended, with a soft "Mmm," and she moved back to my face, only pausing to put both her hands on me and push my face again.</p> <p>She told me to get up, turn around, and she laid back behind me. She pulled my shirt off over my head, and we lay there for a moment, arms, face, bodies. Just like on the first day of "The Truth"? I didn't recognize it, but she was already breathing heavily. That made me more aroused. It felt so real, like our bodies were real, like we were a part of each other, and I couldn't keep my fingers from rubbing over that spot on her stomach, and it made her shiver, all over again.</p> <p>Her hands slid over me again, and I leaned over to kiss her neck, feeling her shiver. Our lips parted for a moment, and I looked into her eyes, wondering if she could recognize how aroused I felt in the same way she was. She looked down at what I was doing to her, then reached over and put her fingers on my cock where it might have been without her clothes, sliding them down and back overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
