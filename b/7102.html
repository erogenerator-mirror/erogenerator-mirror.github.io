She leaned in slowly, kissing me softly all over my face. "Would you ever consider fucking a beautiful, sexy girl... like me?"</p> <p>I nodded. "But, right now, I just want to try out my new toy."</p> <p>"Yes, baby," she whispered, "this is my new toy. Now relax and enjoy."</p> <p>She gently pushed me back on the bed, straddling my body. She leaned over me as I lay on my side, kissing my ear.</p> <p>"You're so good to me tonight," she said softly, "you're the best. Just lay back and listen to me."</p> <p>As our kisses became more intense, she slowly moved until she could lower herself on to me. My fingers fisted themselves in her hair, as she began to rock her hips back and forth, grinding against me. She was breathing hard, the soft moan she made telling me how much it had grown.</p> <p>We were still very, very excited, but after a minute or two she said, "I think it's time for me to have a little fun." As she rotated her hips so that the lips on my neck brushed her clit, she pushed further down onto me. "Here," she said, "I've got you. Now I have the real fun, don't you worry."</p> <p>She moved forward again, and I felt her breasts rest on my chest as she leaned down. She rested her weight on me, her knees on either side of my hips, her thighs brushing my skin.</p> <p>"Does this feel good?" she whispered, her thighs sliding across me, "Does it get to me?"</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered, "oh yes."</p> <p>She kissed me lightly, and then lifted her self away. I was a bit disappointed when she sat again and leaned over me, taking my cock in her hand.</p> <p>"Now, baby," she said, "I will teach you the real joys of sucking cock."</p> <p>She slowly lowered her head, her lips sliding up and down the length of my cock. The soft lips were cool on me, the smell of sex lingered as she worked her mouth up and down, a smile on her face as she continued to pleasure me. She ran her tongue up and down my shaft as she moved up and down, then licked up the bottom side, making me shiver, but also a soft moan escape my lips.</p> <p>As she sucked me, she played with her clit, slipping her finger in with one hand as she worked her lips up and down. Every now and then she would bring her wet finger to my lips, and I would return the kiss with full passion for her.</p> <p>She continued to move her mouth up and down, and as I licked along her lips, I felt her body tense. She pulled away, and I watched her as she looked down on me, my face coated in her fluids.</p> <p>"I'm gonna make this pussy so wet you're gonna taste even better," she told me. "It'll feel amazing. You're going to love my tongue as long as you like it."</p> <p>With those words, and the look on her face, I was almost unable to speak. This was it. What the fuck was happening here?</p> <p>"I'm gonna teach you how to really love a cock," she grinned, "now, baby, I have something for you."</p> <p>She moved across me again, kissing me again as her fingers began to stroke me. I felt her wet tongue moving up and down along the underside of my shaft, as she worked herself up and down on me.</p> <p>"Mmm," she moaned, "you're so fucking big." She ran her tongue along my balls while she continued to stroke me for a few more minutes, but I couldn't help but moan and shiver as she pleasured herself while she continued to move up and down, the feeling that I'd never felt in my entire life only amplified by her words.</p> <p>"It's time, baby," she said, "Now I really have you."</p> <p>I felt my cock begin to twitch, and almost at the exact same time I felt the delicious sensation of her wetness on my lips, which I tried desperately to keep closed.</p> <p>"Come on baby," she said, "let me finish."</p> <p>She was almost laughing at her own words now, and so were our movements. "Oh, yeah," I heard myself moan, "I need it so bad!" I tried to concentrate on licking my lips, but I couldn't. I felt like a string was being drawn and I couldn't get the whole thing out of my mouth.</p> <p>"I've been so close to cumming!" I managed to get out.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said, "takeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
