I didn't want to be out of the mood at that moment, that she might actually know how to handle the situation. I had always had some reservations about my own sexuality. But, she was one of my closest friends. Plus I liked her a lot and it was only a moment of awkwardness that led to the first of many orgasms from her for the next few days.</p> <p>"Just the sight of you getting off is getting me really horny, my pussy is so wet right now." My voice was shaky, and I couldn't hold on any longer. "Oh shit." I turned my head and looked up again, at the ceiling. "Oh shit." I didn't want to let go anymore.</p> <p>I grabbed my bra off the shelf and dropped it on the floor by my bed. I turned to face Michelle when I turned back to the door of her dorm room. I looked her up and down until my eyes took in her black t-shirt clinging to her body. I was so hard for her, I thought I would burst. I pulled her toward me, until my cock bumped into her, I could feel my heart beat against her cheek.</p> <p>My arms went around her waist before I could bring myself back. Her breath smelled like strawberries. Her breasts were almost as soft as my breasts. She wrapped her arms around me. There was no need to kiss or make out anymore, she felt so amazingly soft and warm. It felt so good to be holding her.</p> <p>After only a couple seconds of touching, Michelle began unbuttoning my shirt. She slid the fabric off my shoulders and let it flutter onto the floor as she removed my shirt and threw it onto the floor. Our mouths met again. I let her slide my straps off her shoulders so she could get my shirt. She pulled me close and her tongue swirled around the top of my lips.</p> <p>My hands slipped behind her as she knelt in front of me. I let my thumbs lightly caress her breasts as our open mouths met.</p> <p>The feel of her flesh was so amazing, she was as smooth as glass. I ran my thumbs over her nipple, it was so hard that I thought I would explode. It seemed to get harder when I tweaked it.</p> <p>Finally standing, she pulled me out of my shorts, and with one quick move, dropped them on the floor. In seconds, we were both naked. Her nipples were big and dark. I pushed her onto her back. Her legs were wide open. I pressed against her clit and slid inside of her. Her walls were tight around my cock. Her pussy was soaking wet and she was so eager to get fucked that in just a second, she pushed me off.</p> <p>Michelle had taken her clothes off when she came out. She had taken a seat on the bed, her arms behind her head. I could see a glistening sheen of sweat glisten on her breast. She was biting her lip, with a smile that I could barely see. She looked like a sexy cheerleader with an amazing body and beautiful, sexy face. It was like a challenge that she must really get.</p> <p>I leaned over and began to lick and suck her nipples. I kept my hands above her and worked them down to her pussy. She reached up and began gently playing with my balls that looked so firm that you could just about reach them with both hands. I let one touch of my teeth on them, and she let out a little moan under my tongue.</p> <p>I began to play with her clit. This time I pushed one finger deep inside of her.</p> <p>"Oh my god, please don't stop, I need to cum." Michelle moaned, as I continued to work on her pussy.</p> <p>I began to increase the speed and pressure on her clit until she began to twitch. The pleasure that she was getting from my finger began to overcome her entire body and she began to buck underneath me. When her pussy was on fire and it was getting closer, she reached for one of her breasts and began to squeeze her nipple.</p> <p>I kept my face pressed against her as she started to cum. I felt hot. This must be the right way to build you up for this kind of intensity later, but that only made my own orgasm that much stronger.</p> <p>I came with a grunt. I felt the tightness of her pussy and her walls tighten around my cock. I held her there as she writhed under her hand.</p> <p>When I stopped my motion, she looked at me.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah." She turned her face to me. "I'm sorry, that was pretty good."</p> <p>I looked at her.</p> <p>"Why am I so fucking horny?" Her smile made me feel good as long ago as I could rememberâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
