I think that's pretty cool. I didn't know you were so smart."</p> <p>"Thank you mom, I'm starting to get a little edgy right now. The only thing I'm going to do about being your son is to do what we want and get your blessing." "That's fine baby. So just what exactly have I told you? You can watch your game and do your own thing. Just let Mommy give you what you want."</p> <p>"We want to give you everything there is, Mommy. We just want to be with you."</p> <p>"Just do everything else you're supposed to or we'll never get there."</p> <p>"But you do it when we're here. We don't want you to think bad about us."</p> <p>"Mom" She got up and embraced her friend with both arms then went and sat beside me. I turned and laid my head on her shoulder, and they hugged and I could feel them kissing the same way my sister was. We laid in bed until morning and talked for hours about everything that we had shared with each other. I wanted to know what we were thinking when it happened. I didn't really know what to do or think at the time, but I knew I had already made a commitment to have her as my mother and not a sister or a niece.</p> <p>We kissed again but this time it was more intense. Her tongue was probing and I wanted more, but I said I was off to breakfast and we both went to the kitchen. I poured my coffee and took another sip and said, "I'm going shopping."</p> <p>They both jumped out of bed, grabbed their stuff and ran to the bathroom. I started toward the room and when they reached me I said, "Do you remember what we talked about before we talked about what you told me?"</p> <p>"Oh yes," was Mom's reply and she and the girls said, "I think you're a lot smarter than I figured out the other day, so I didn't make some excuse of it." They laughed and I followed them to the kitchen and got the coffee and took a seat at the table.</p> <p>After a couple of cups of coffee and a glass of milk I said, "I have to go and get Mommy something for breakfast, I promised Mommy I'd come clean when I get back."</p> <p>Mom said, "Okay baby. I got you some breakfast but you can wait here while she eats first." As the girls got up to leave the breakfast dishes I went to the breakfast table and served breakfast to them. I noticed it was already half-past ten and Mom got up and we stood as one. I brought out a plate in the morning paper and sat it in front of them. "So do you really feel the same way about Mom?"</p> <p>"Do I want to tell you that? You mean so much to me that if I don't see what I want for my life, I'll just ask Mommy." I said as I raised my spoon and fed one of them.</p> <p>"I want the same kind of thing. But only if my father wants the same thing that you and I have. I'm not sure what the real deal is between us."</p> <p>"I'll agree with it," I said." I don't want to be a big disappointment or your son's problem. Okay?"</p> <p>"That's a fair point. So, here's what you'll be doing. I want you to go and pick up Mommy at two-thirty and bring a dress for dinner tonight. Then I want you to go to breakfast in your room wearing your panties before you go into the bathroom so I'm really sure you'll smell when you get in. You can take my dress too, I'm sure it'll be a nice surprise."</p> <p>She paused and said, "Okay, I'll be right back," and she left the room. They finished feeding the girls and got their dishes in the kitchen and I put the tray on the table. I was surprised at how quickly she was becoming a mother.</p> <p>When Mom's mother went back into the room to pick up her clothing she called out, "He's ready now." I went to them as she was putting her clothes away.</p> <p>"Mommy's getting ready for breakfast in the morning. We're going to have breakfast in bed when she comes back." I said. Mom and I both got up to go. We waited while Mom's mother went back to the bedroom and then it was off. I waited for a moment to put my dishes away and then I took mom's dress as well, saying, "Let's get breakfast started before it gets hot."</p> <p>She was in the kitchen about 15 minutes later and they weren't far from me.
