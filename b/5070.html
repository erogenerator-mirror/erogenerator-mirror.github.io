I was just staring at her as all of her expressions, the way her eyes, her skin, her breasts could barely contain the excitement that was building inside her.</p> <p>She finally released that part of herself that I hadn't seen since our first date. I felt dizzy from the feeling of that first moment.</p> <p>"I still can't believe my little boy wants to do that," she said in between deep breaths. She was smiling now. "I can see from his eyes that he's thinking that."</p> <p>She looked even sexier than before while I was on the floor and the whole moment lasted for probably an hour. In fact it was almost six or eight minutes. I felt the blood start to move again. It was as if my eyes had somehow turned to mush, and I had never felt so alive in my life. I had to try to keep focus on her eyes.</p> <p>"If it was you," I said out of breath, "I would've lost it there a long time ago."</p> <p>She reached up and started to give me a big kiss.</p> <p>"I've never been with anyone since you," the young girl said. The expression on her face, the look on her face, I felt it all change. Before I realized what I was doing, I was licking her tongue. She gave a deep groan while taking me in her mouth. I guess that had to feel great. It did.</p> <p>After a few moments of that, she stopped, and with her lips gently kissing mine, she looked deep into my eyes. "I'm sorry," she said. "I really can't..."</p> <p>I leaned forward to meet her, and then pulled her up to make a kiss as deep as our first. I wanted her to feel the same thing.</p> <p>"I love you," I whispered to her in a small whisper that sounded like a whisper.</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>I don't know what I expected or thought that I'd say that again, or even for long, but in the back of my mind, there was a thought that I didn't think I'd ever want to repeat: I loved her.</p> <p>My tongue slowly explored her mouth. She was moaning and breathing hard into my mouth while I gently rubbed her back. She moved closer until our hips were touching. Her bare mound was pushing forward towards me, and as our kiss continued, I could feel her heat. It was the hottest time of the year, and I still couldn't believe how hot I was at this point.</p> <p>At some point, we stopped kissing. She turned her face to look at me and I could tell that her face was flushed.</p> <p>"What did...you..." she gasped. "you...what did you do?"</p> <p>"Mmmm," she moaned. "I..."</p> <p>I gently cupped her breasts and gently squeezed them. I was feeling her nipple harden. I knew that she really had been turned on earlier, and I didn't mind. I kissed my way down to her neck and started to kiss it and rub it.</p> <p>"Y...yes honey," she said. "Ohh..."</p> <p>I pulled the white blouse away from her breasts and saw the contrast of her skin. She was wearing a bra now. As I looked at her naked breasts, she really did seem to enjoy the attention she was getting from men.</p> <p>"I think that's enough foreplay for now," I whispered at her. There was a part of my heart feeling something else, but I hadn't ever felt anything so erotic as that first time with Rachel.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I was going through my break, I was surprised at how much better my memory had improved since. I hadn't expected to live my life, but I felt right now. Rachel seemed to have an even better understanding of how I felt, and that she had been a good teacher. She took my lead, and when she brought it to bear on our second date, she seemed to sense that the time was right to make love to me.</p> <p>Our second date was better than anything I ever felt before. The first date was the one that changed my life in one way or another. After that, we continued to make out. We kissed, and I went down on her. I was really glad that she wanted to go down on me as much as I did.</p> <p>Her thighs were pressed into my face, and I could tell she was really enjoying it. We continued kissing, and I could tell that my face was wet. The thought of sucking on her breasts got me hard again. She had her hand in my hair, and that brought me back to the point.</p> <p>The second date had been the best of both dates. We didn't even have sex, althoughâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
