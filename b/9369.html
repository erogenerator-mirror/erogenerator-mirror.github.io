She said. I don't think I could have done anything else. I felt a tug on my heart.</p> <p>"It was just because of our breakup. Just because we're together." She said.</p> <p>I thought about it a bit. I didn't want to break up with her. But I also didn't want to leave my marriage. I didn't want to leave my family. I didn't want to lose her. She said I had to do a better job of it or I might lose her. So I just said, "Well, how about an early wedding tomorrow."</p> <p>Amber looked down at her feet, I thought. "I guess that means the only way to make you happy is to marry me." I told her as one big stupid grin spread across her face. She started to cry. I tried to comfort her, "You don't have to do that. There are lots of good reasons you shouldn't do this." Not wanting to spoil the mood we just had, I turned her toward the door and we made our arrangements and said our goodbyes.</p> <p>When I walked her down the aisle, she looked up at me and said, "It was a big decision on my part. I'm not saying I regret it."</p> <p>"Don't go thinking it will have to be with any force behind it, it's something I wanted to experience for a long time and this was the best chance." I assured her.</p> <p>So that night at the wedding, she looked very happy and said she truly loved me for all my love and devotion. We had a good time. It was just a little emotional. I thought of our relationship like we had before. We didn't do anything together. In our whole relationship, I was the perfect husband. My love for her overwhelmed any reservations that I had about a single, committed couple on that day.</p> <p>After a month of marriage, Amber had moved out of her father's study and moved in with her brother, Brad. We got married. I had always been very happy with the way my life was going. Now that Amber was coming back home, I decided I was going to do the same thing. I wanted to keep the happiness that we had before. The pain we just faced became too great. I needed time to be sure how things would work and how I would handle it.</p> <p>Amber had a beautiful, young-lover-of-the-two-years-hopster-to-be. I'd been able to have a decent relationship with her during the past year. We were getting along well, except for where her family was and what she did in the house. It was an added benefit since we went from being an average family to being closer friends than ever before. However, I was beginning to worry that she might change and I needed to be a bigger man. I didn't want to hurt her and make an ass of myself by trying to change her. When the wedding arrived the bride went to the reception and I went to my bridal party. I knew if I was to continue to make the best of everything, I'd have to try and be a better man. The wedding moved quickly because most of the guests had gotten married. One older man, a well-known local minister who could give the wedding bands, was one of the organizers and after the ceremony we were all going to a huge church. As we prepared for the ceremony I made sure I was the first to greet the new bride.</p> <p>The minister was a good guy. He was a real nice guy. I was surprised Amber ever married him. This woman had seemed to lose a lot of weight after a guy her age had been killed. At the first of the reception, Amber and I gave a couple of small speeches for a while. Then, I started a conversation about whether I should wait until the end of the ceremony. As with the first part of the service, Amber had left me to it. She wanted to meet with the groom herself.</p> <p>Once they got there, the minister handed the bride to me. I went upstairs and waited for Amber to tell her parents. As she led her family to the door, I told her what happened to her father. I told her my feelings for her had changed. She looked at me with sadness in her eyes and asked, "What does it feel like being a father?"</p> <p>I was a bit taken back by what she said. It didn't seem right to have to explain to my parents that she was about 35. Even after all the times I had done things to her in just a few weeks, it felt wrong to tell them. Amber wanted to do the right thing and do something to be happy. This wasn't me or this girl. I couldn't see what she was trying to do.</p> <p>"I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
