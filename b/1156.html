I managed to get out, trying to pull from her legs the covers I had left on the bed as soon as I got out from under the covers. I looked at her face. It was like she had been crying for a long time, and I almost expected to say something like 'What the fuck happened?' But I was caught by the emotion in her face, and I managed to stammer out something I wasn't sure I wanted to say, "I...I saw my brother having sex with my mum...did you know?"</p> <p>She gave me a surprised look. "Oh...y-you saw...?"</p> <p>"What? Oh, yes, Mum! My dad fucked me in their study after school, and then after that I heard it."</p> <p>"You what?" She raised her right eyebrow.</p> <p>"I..I...I heard it!" I managed. "I'm embarrassed! Mum, I haven't been seeing anyone!"</p> <p>"Oh, really?" She shook her head as she saw my confused look. "That's the problem. Are you sure you don't want this, Tom? This isn't going to stop if you don't want to. Look, just for a moment, before I lose my nerve, I'll explain. First, my dad fucked my mum on me. So, now look at everything, Tom."</p> <p>I looked back at her, not wanting to say anything. Her tone had changed. It was almost like she was afraid to, but if I told her what I found about her, she'd stop being afraid so soon. With that in mind, I looked back at the bedside clock. It read 3.30. I sat up, feeling the mattress shake and shake. "Mum? Please don't tell anyone, please?" I begged. She hadn't said anything else; I was worried.</p> <p>She looked at me as if she'd made a decision. I knew what she was thinking. In a small voice, I said, "Please, please don't tell my dad. They'd kill me if they found out, Tom." She just sat there, looking at the bed.</p> <p>I had to ask myself. The first thing I think to remember is that I had never actually masturbated. I had been too busy with the school career I had been involved with, to try and go through with it. I had gone out of my way to stay close to my dad. I kept my eyes on the road as I got out from under the covers. In my mind, I had tried to think of her as my mum and how I wanted them to look together. It wasn't easy. She was different, but not different. I started to go over how I could tell the truth.</p> <p>"But...but.." I paused for a few seconds. "But what...oh," she was quiet, and I had to ask. "Mum...did you..." I had to try to say that, but I knew as it made me start to fall into a deeper place, like it made the blood rush.</p> <p>"Mum?"</p> <p>"Are you alright?" I was surprised by how fast she was able to answer me, and more than once before I even managed to bring up my story. "Mum...did you enjoy going to school?"</p> <p>I kept thinking that I could see my father having sex with his own mum in the next room, or maybe it was Mum and him making love in there. I thought that was going to be a problem later, and I was right!</p> <p>"M-mom..." I said, looking at the side of her face. I didn't feel my father with me right then, but I was confused. "Did I enjoy it...is it...you know...that way?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it was good, wasn't it?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it was..."</p> <p>"So, did you enjoy it, Tom?"</p> <p>"God, yeah, Mum, it was good. I never felt anything like it before or since. It was so different, you know."</p> <p>"I know, but that's still nice. You've got a nice boy, Tom," she said. "Would you like to spend some time with your mum and me?" she added as a sort of jest. We laughed like silly school girls for a moment.</p> <p>I had to give her the benefit of the doubt for a moment. I didn't want her to think that I was upset that I didn't want to, but was shocked when she said, "If I didn't think you felt that sort of way before, what would you feel about that?" She looked back at me with her beautiful green eyes. They were the look she had sometimes used to get me in trouble.</p> <p>"I-I don't know, Mum," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
