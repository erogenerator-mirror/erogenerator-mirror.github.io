A couple of minutes later we were in my office, his arm snaked around me.</p> <p>"Good weekend?" he asked.</p> <p>I smiled. "It's a lot of fun at the office. Why? Is it a good way to go?"</p> <p>"It's fun. I love to make love in the office, too."</p> <p>"Why a place we can go sometimes?"</p> <p>"Because we don't have to go anywhere else."</p> <p>"Are you saying we shouldn't go someplace?"</p> <p>"No, I suppose we should do that," I said. "And I don't care."</p> <p>"Maybe," he replied, grinning.</p> <p>He kissed me again, before pulling back.</p> <p>"Can we finish this?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," he said. "Tomorrow morning. We can decide."</p> <p>"So we're not really in love?"</p> <p>"Not really. We just like to be here."</p> <p>"Does that bother you?"</p> <p>I shrugged. "Maybe some. But if it doesn't bother me I doubt it."</p> <p>"I'm glad that we're together," he said. "I would have done everything to keep you."</p> <p>"That makes two of us. So what?" I asked, grinning.</p> <p>"So you don't mind if we do this?"</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think the two of us will need to go anywhere else," I said. "I mean, we might get a job, or I might get a job somewhere else. We can just keep doing it."</p> <p>"I mean, I wouldn't mind spending a few days here. I'm a little sore up upstairs."</p> <p>"I know, I know. But it's more fun with you there. I mean, you're my boyfriend right?"</p> <p>"Actually, I didn't know if I should get to the 'just this once.' I don't want to do that. I guess most guys think there's no chance."</p> <p>"So that wouldn't be too much, too soon. You could always go home to your boyfriend."</p> <p>"Not really," I said with a giggle.</p> <p>"Just be sure to tell me how you felt the whole time."</p> <p>"I'll say."</p> <p>"Maybe we can come down to dinner a little later. You know, I think we could get some lunch together. Maybe we would go out to eat before we had to say goodbye."</p> <p>"I'd like that," he said. "When we get the hell out of here, I would appreciate it."</p> <p>"I'd like that a lot," I said as I hugged him.</p> <p>"I guess you'd better," he said and kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>When we got to the elevator, he started to shake.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I told him. "I shouldn't have done anything."</p> <p>"It's okay. And you are welcome here anytime. Anytime, you can come stay with me."</p> <p>"Thanks. You're nice to me, Dan."</p> <p>As I walked up to him, I realized that there was a little more I hadn't said. I wanted very much to believe it; it was just something that had happened. And Dan was nice to me, too. We had known each other all our lives, so it wasn't like we hadn't been in a couple of the many different relationships we had. It was just different.</p> <p>The more I thought about it, the more the idea of making love to Dan really interested me. And the idea of telling him I loved to go out with him, to go see him, to have sex was very exciting to say the least. But I also realized that I was still very attracted to him, as if I'd never been with another man before, and that I felt really guilty about doing it. And I'd done it with Dan just to make love to him, as if it was the same thing between us.</p> <p>But the next time we were together, I was happy that my boyfriend was going to have a relationship with me as much as I had with him. That really seemed like a good thing.</p> <p>But then I had to face reality. It wasn't going to take forever, especially since what we had really been avoiding the truth was what we'd done with guys our ages up. I had no doubt that Dan had no idea he would be cheating on me, and that it had been for real, that I was doing what I always wanted to do. That realization made my heart tear. And although I couldn't explain why I'd felt like that, I thought, at least as much as I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
