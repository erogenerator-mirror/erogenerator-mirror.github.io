Both our families were pretty proud of us, so neither the parents ever seemed to know a thing. Both Dad and Mom were in the same class, but they weren't exactly smart enough to know what all was going through the minds that we were. Dad hadn't even taken a second look at me and I'd started to feel guilty.</p> <p>"Of, about...you know..." I was already turning to leave when, without thinking, she looked right at me again. Suddenly I knew what she'd been thinking. "Of course I'm ready to take you, you know. Just..." She raised her right hand, indicating to me what she wanted to do. I knew what she had in mind, which she'd also said.</p> <p>"Just what, Jeezus?" she said playfully, as she reached out her middle finger and brushed it along my cheek. Instantly I felt a twinge of attraction to this woman. I wasn't even 100% sure she was serious, but it wasn't like there was an ounce of doubt or doubt in her mind. It was just something she was doing, and for the first time I didn't feel like I was pushing her away.</p> <p>"Just...just this one time," I stammered, unable to believe what I was hearing. I'd known from the beginning that she would come to this point and we'd go no farther than that. Her mother had been out of town to do something or that she'd been too busy to teach some of the kids to read. It had been only a matter of time, until I'd seen some action on the Internet and she'd eventually come to the aid of my wife, so, with each passing second, more and more of my emotions would appear to be coming from the other side of the coin. But how could we talk to her that way? She'd been the one to take me there, to tell me that "just don't try to fuck up my marriage." Still, I'd had that crush on her for years now. She, on the other hand, was only a little girl. It was more than a week ago that we'd talked about marriage, and I didn't think there was a right time to change the subject. I'm going to admit I'd already begun to feel like I was going to throw in a lot of cash. I guess I'd already spent a lot of money on my new home, even when my first wife hadn't been worth it. I wasn't a lawyer, and there were plenty of things I could sue myself. And of course there have been the times I'd taken a lover. I guess that didn't matter, although some of it was. It was just there because there was nothing to back it up. I'd even done it in the bedroom, while my wife was away.</p> <p>I could feel that familiar heat of desire starting at my crotch and rising up to my chest, but I couldn't tell if I was feeling it from her or not. She noticed immediately. "Yeah, that would be nice!" she said, her voice barely containing the surprise in her tone and with that, her hand slipped inside my robe and she began to stroke me lightly in the way those old married girls were always doing to me. That felt absolutely incredible, but there was always a part of me that would try to keep myself from doing that in front of her in the future. Her hand didn't budge.</p> <p>"Mmm, I guess I can finally say that you look pretty good in your robe!" she murmilled, and the words came out like a moan as her fingertips reached the base just above my dick. I leaned my head back and let the robe fall open. She looked over at me, with her hand still teasing me slowly.</p> <p>"Well, then, let's take a look at you," she said, her voice still a little louder than before. It wasn't a question, just a demand. I didn't expect anything else from her, but she sounded so matter-of-fact about it. "Come," she said authoritatively, and I obeyed. She turned her back to me, and with shaking hands, lifted my shirt off the floor and tossed it aside. She slid it off and then leaned her back against my chest, and started licking and biting her way down my torso in long swipes with her tongue and lips. I could feel the softness of her cheek against my skin and the gentle pressure it was exerting against my chest, but it didn't take much of that. The warmth of her mouth coming up with my heart beat quickly, then back down again as it rose up to meet hers. I could tell she was getting a little turned on by the way I was reacting to herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
