She said as she stepped into my office.</p> <p>She came in behind me and I heard her say, "I heard you got that thing. You know what I think?"</p> <p>She pressed a small red button and the door opened and in walked a young woman. She smiled as she walked across to my desk where I was setting up our portfolio.</p> <p>She looked up when she saw the picture I already had and asked, "Can I...?"</p> <p>"Of course, Miss," was all I could come up with.</p> <p>She looked at me as she walked towards me, and she didn't say anything else as my lips moved to hers. As soon as we were face to face, the girl backed up, but kept my lips pressed to hers the whole time.</p> <p>My hands were all over her as I pulled her in tight to me, and for the next twenty seconds we kissed and I felt our hips gyrating against each other at my touch.</p> <p>Finally, when neither of us seemed ready to break, she looked back into my eyes and said, "Is he a good kisser?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I groaned as I felt her hand slowly unbutton my shirt, "I hope I'm not too obvious."</p> <p>"Be careful," she whispered as she stepped back, "there's no one in the office right now..."</p> <p>"No one's paying any attention to us." I replied.</p> <p>"It's your turn now," was the soft reply that seemed to fall from her lips just before she stepped off my desk.</p> <p>It was a few moments before I stepped back from her and I saw her eyes focus on me as she approached me, "What did she say when she said, "I'd love to do another one now?"?"</p> <p>"Just be careful, I was just about to say, "I love to suck your big cock"!"</p> <p>She reached up and slowly began to unbutton my shirt, the whole time letting her fingertips run down the inside of my arms.</p> <p>When my shirt was unfastened, she took the waistband of my pants and slowly slipped them off my hips, and I stepped out of the pants before dropping the rest of my clothes and kicking them into the chair that I was in the last available room.</p> <p>I saw her smile as she stood in front of me again, and then she dropped to her knees in the space between my legs.</p> <p>I heard her take a deep breath as her warm mouth engulfed my cock and I felt her tongue slip between my cheeks as she pulled me into her mouth.</p> <p>I closed my eyes as she sucked me and I was amazed at how much she was able to get into her mouth.</p> <p>Her hand reached down to cup my balls as her head slowly picked up pace and she slowly licked up and down the underside of my shaft as it slid between her lips.</p> <p>One arm on each side of my legs, she slowly lowered to the floor as her fingers slowly massaged the base of my penis.</p> <p>I couldn't hold out any longer as I felt my juices begin to gather. She knew how I liked it best, and I wasn't one to turn down an opportunity to feel my pleasure.</p> <p>The feeling building inside of me was growing exponentially, and I wanted her to know that too.</p> <p>Just as I was about to tell her I was going to come, she pulled away from my cock, dropped back on her haunches, and looked up at me, saying, "If you make me comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
