She was a little bit drunk.</p> <p>She was a drunk.</p> <p>She got another kick out of the kiss and I got up and looked around.</p> <p>"How long is it until you get it all over your clothes again?" she asked.</p> <p>"I guess I am a little more tired than I thought," I answered. My eyes met hers again. I was hoping I was not blushing.</p> <p>"Yeah," she started, "but that is the first chance I will get all day,"</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Really. I thought this would be a good time," she said, "I'll be in for a big one when we get back up again."</p> <p>In a moment, I got up. I was still in a state of shock. How can she, who I'd known only a few hours ago, say that we are going to get back up again? I had thought she would be a little more drunk than I was. And it was true that she got a kick out of the kiss.</p> <p>"You said it's going to be a big one by the time we get back up," I said.</p> <p>She looked a little hurt.</p> <p>"I know you won't be able to sleep that long tomorrow night and you have so little energy," I said.</p> <p>"Please don't. I've got plenty of energy."</p> <p>"I don't understand."</p> <p>She kept on smiling to me.</p> <p>"Oh, you don't," she answered softly.</p> <p>"I guess I do," I answered before I said anything.</p> <p>"Please?" she looked at me again.</p> <p>"OK," I put the cards on the table.</p> <p>There was a little time left before we would get our chance. I took her hand and we walked down the hall toward my bedroom.</p> <p>Before we entered my room, Linda went to my dresser to get her camera phone. In a moment she came into the room.</p> <p>"This has got to be a huge joke," she said.</p> <p>"It's a little," I answered, "but I think I can manage,"</p> <p>Linda stood next to my bed. She had a hand covering her mouth to stifle a sob.</p> <p>"Come here and kiss me," she said.</p> <p>I was still in shock. What the hell is going on here?</p> <p>I took her hand and stepped towards her. For the next few minutes we just stood there looking into each other's eyes. When she brought her hand up and touched my face with it, I felt so light-headed that I nearly fell.</p> <p>It only took a moment before I reached out and put my arms around her. I pulled her to me. Her shoulders were pressed to mine. Her arms came around me in a tight embrace. She put her hands on my waist and started to slide her hands up and down my back. I felt as if she was slowly rubbing her hands all over me. When my hands reached my sides, I felt as if she were trying to draw my clothes down my body. I took a quick look around the room. Everything was in order.</p> <p>We were going nowhere fast. This wasn't a joke. We had just had sex. And now we were going to kiss.</p> <p>I broke the embrace. Then I held her body close with my hands. Our hips were pressed together as our lips touched. She slowly brought one hand up to touch as much of my chest as she could. When I gave a squeeze, she immediately put the other hand on my face again. I could feel her body tensing as she held my body closer and tighter to hers.</p> <p>Linda felt good. I loved the feeling of warm skin against body. It felt so different from someone other than a body. I didn't know where we were going next but I decided that it felt good to take the lead and have my way with her. We stood there for probably ten minutes.</p> <p>Then it was my turn to let out a small gasp. I reached out to her neck and found it warm to the touch. My hand followed her arm and down the side of her breast. She started to moan.</p> <p>She let me go. Her body was very warm and I could feel the heat of her body against my own. My hands were exploring her body at a slow and steady pace. I knew she wouldn't stop after that but I wanted to taste her. I lowered my head down to kiss her.</p> <p>Linda was almost instantly lost in the kiss. Not once did her body relax. She was kissing me back. I felt her lips moving against mine. When we finally parted, for a minute, we held the kiss another minute. When we pulled away, I got a big, broad smile on my face.</p> <p>"It's your turn to make theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
