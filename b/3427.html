"How's the water feeling?"</p> <p>"It's great." It had been a while since he had spent the night alone. His mind hadn't been on the job for too long. He wondered if her husband could come in and make any adjustments. No, the water certainly could. That didn't mean everything was OK with her, and as he realized this, he wondered if she could really, truly blame him for having a vasectomy. He decided that probably wouldn't be necessary and he could at least use his phone to call her before she got wind of it. He'd get to his own room pretty quick. Maybe after she got settled in she'd think more clearly on what she could be thinking.</p> <p>He took his shirt off and took off his shoes, jeans, and shorts. He put his underwear on his bed as he left and turned to leave. A moment later he felt a strong, naked hand reach under his shirt and grab his cock. He looked down and gasped as he saw a face that he'd never seen before. He froze.</p> <p>"You're naked," a gasp escaped his lips as he saw her. He started to shake. He wasn't expecting to see her like this, not with his clothes off and her arms around his waist, but he'd hoped that if she took off her clothes he'd get laid enough to let her have sex. Her pussy was on fire. He could feel himself throbbing in response to her touch. It was hard to believe. He smiled. It was pretty hot.</p> <p>She pulled him back towards the bed. He put both palms on the mattress but didn't touch her. She pressed her lips to his neck and shoulder, and her lips and tongue were on fire wherever she went. She was hot for him and he was too. He could feel her hot breath on the crook of his shoulder, and he felt her breasts press against his chest. They pressed together, straining against his erection. It felt wonderful, so hard, so hot. He ran his hands up the outside of her soft, shapely legs and ended up around her hips.</p> <p>She moaned softly as she felt him enter her. He could feel her warmth through the fabric of her nightshirt when he pressed against her, and he was surprised at how easily he penetrated her. He pushed into her and she gasped for air, her breasts heaving underneath her. Her mouth open and her hands pressed against the mattress to hold against her heaving chest but he was all she needed. He drove into her hard and deep.</p> <p>She squealed and he moaned at the sensation of her moist warmth surrounding his shaft. Her muscles clenched and squeezed him as he thrust hard and deep. A few hours ago nothing would have felt that good. He hadn't thought about this sort of thing before. Not since he met her husband and her husband had been able to have such a great weekend. And now he was being treated like that because he'd always wanted to be with her. But here he was thrusting so hard into the small of her back that the bedframe was sliding down with every breath.</p> <p>She let out a cry when he pulled out of her. She looked down at herself and saw her sex glisten in the faint light. His shaft was wet with liquid and he could easily feel her warmth. His own heart thumped in his ears. He leaned down and kissed her softly on the forehead. She smiled and kissed him again. He'd felt so good in the morning.</p> <p>They lay and looked for each other. They were both so tired. It had been so good to be together. He looked at her. She looked so peaceful and happy. He wondered what would have happened if he hadn't come home and found such a wonderful person there. He felt his heart go out to her. He knew that he'd never be able to tell her that she'd always have to be a part of his life. They were a perfect match. They were both the ones he would never let go.</p> <p>A few hours later he had gotten dressed and his clothes were back on. It had been so amazing to be with her. He would never forget thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
