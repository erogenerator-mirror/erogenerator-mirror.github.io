At least, at their rate, they didn't. At first I felt like there'd been some kind of breakthrough, but that was just the start of the day's events.</p> <p>My next fuck was very good, too. I fucked her ass in several positions, before I got tired and had to stop. I got it all again.</p> <p>I'd lost count the number of times that night, but not in any way that made it any less pleasurable to me. I'd already lost count, but the sensation of fucking her ass in her own way made even that count better.</p> <p>I'd finished with my second blowjob. She wasn't going to like this, but I was willing to give her something to think about.</p> <p>The second time I blew was spectacular. Her ass clamped hard on my cock and I emptied myself in her. After I'd collapsed on her, she hugged me and started crying again, probably in spite of the fact that I was a hundred times harder and more muscular.</p> <p>We got back to normal and we hadn't even closed the door yet. We had to get some sleep.</p> <p>That's when things changed again. It got to me again. As a result, she kept trying to get out of my room. She went to work even after we'd fallen asleep together, and I knew what else she could do. Her job was to carry me back to the house.</p> <p>I'd already said one more thing that was in the middle of our relationship. It basically consisted of telling her that she could keep our relationship. I'd also told her it wasn't important that she find someone else. If that didn't work, I'd tell her she didn't have to go, and she had to give me my money if she got pregnant.</p> <p>She didn't argue, although I did watch her as she left the house every time.</p> <p>In addition to her job, she had one thing, though. She'd decided to take a vacation on the weekend and would make a very good excuse for me to take some "work out" at a place like that. To be perfectly fair, it was not a good thing, although I was going to be very sore tomorrow when she came home. It would be nice to sit in on another of my favorite movies, a little more kinky than what I'd just had. Perhaps even a little more kinkier than what I'd just been through. Maybe I could even make an effort if I really wanted to try.</p> <p>I was too surprised to do much more than try to make her come to bed each time while I sat in the office, and she was too busy getting done her usual task to go out there every other hour.</p> <p>It was probably just her idea, really. I had no reason to think otherwise. I had a good reason to think otherwise. But it was her idea all along, but I knew that I wouldn't ever be able to do much about it.</p> <p>I was still a teenager, and probably shouldn't have let her do all the work. I wasn't a virgin, but I'm sure that it wouldn't be much fun. I definitely had no idea how it felt to have a woman get used by someone as large and strong as her.</p> <p>I guess I wasn't just inexperienced when it came to sex. I really didn't know what to expect or how to proceed.</p> <p>The thing was though, though, the best way to go about it was to just lie back, and enjoy it. I might not know all of the details behind a blowjob, but I could at least watch her work and get the "fucking skills" we didn't even know she possessed back home. She could definitely suck a cock that was much, much thicker than mine, and possibly thicker and longer than my own. I probably couldn't even taste it. Hell, at least I hadn't tasted it after the shower, when I'd let it go out.</p> <p>And, I was pretty sure I could still get some of the "nookie" off of my fingers in her ass, even though it would probably be the only way to do it if I didn't already have one. I might have to give her every opportunity to do that, but that would not be very kind to her. And maybe even a little rough if she had one that big.</p> <p>I certainly didn't want anything to put me off, but I figured I might end up having to deal with the "virgin" issue after being "staid." Even if I wanted to go further, I wasn't sure I could bring myself to do so.</p> <p>So I closed the door, got up, took her by the hand, and led her upstairsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
