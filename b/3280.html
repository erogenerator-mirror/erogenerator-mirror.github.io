So tight... So very wet!"</p> <p>Her arms were tightly grasping me in the process. She pulled my face into her breasts and her body arched above me. My mouth latched onto her swollen nipple and began sucking it. My legs pressed her tighter to me as she humped her hips back to meet mine.</p> <p>"Ohhh...oh my goodness," she moaned.</p> <p>Her body convulsed as two more orgasms hit her at the same time. She continued to move her body under me but her legs were still wrapped about me and my arms were on the bed as I pushed the head of my cock deep into her body. I knew that I hadn't lasted very long as she was still trembling.</p> <p>The moment passed when she let us up. She lay still in the middle of the bed, her breasts heaving and her mouth hanging open. I watched as she finally moved her legs off of me, pulling them over my head and laying flat on her back with her ankles crossed. Her breasts heaved with her panting as she looked lovingly up at me. I moved onto the bed and lay next to her.</p> <p>"It has been so long since I had my cock inside of you," I said.</p> <p>"I know. That is why I missed you." She kissed me slowly and then kissed my neck.</p> <p>"Can you feel the warmth inside of me?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "It feels just a little different from me. I think I'm going to be sore if I can take a rest."</p> <p>"I hope so."</p> <p>"I'm glad!" Her eyes smiled up at me.</p> <p>Her hand dropped and cupped my balls and shaft and she began stroking them. Her other hand was on my chest, stroking my face with her fingers. I kissed her as I felt my shaft begin to throb and tighten in her hand. She knew it and I knew she would notice as it hardened to its full size.</p> <p>"Do you want to try?"</p> <p>"No, we have to think," I replied.</p> <p>"I've been looking forward to it," she said softly. Her hand caressed and fondled me as she looked up at me. Her hand moved as if it wanted to feel inside of me. She gently ran her finger up the length of my shaft, pulling it back and then wrapping her hand around it and stroking me faster, urging it to give her what was hers.</p> <p>"You feel so good inside of me," she said. "Your cock feels so good."</p> <p>"I like to think so," I said as it began to pulse slightly with her stroking.</p> <p>She looked up at me and then into my eyes. Her breath caught as she saw that I could see her arousal, her desire as she sat there looking at me, my cock throbbing in her hand and watching me. Her hand moved quickly, moving over the head of my cock, coating it with her saliva.</p> <p>"Ohhh...ohhh...oh my," she moaned.</p> <p>Her mouth opened slightly and she reached out with her tongue, licking the side of my shaft as she continued to stroke me, moving her tongue and lips up and down my shaft. Her hand began sliding up and down my shaft as she continued to watch my face and smile.</p> <p>"Ohhhh...oh my god, Jenn," I said as an added sensation of her tongue on my swollen head caused me to shiver.</p> <p>"Just like that?" She asked. "Would you like to come inside of me?"</p> <p>"Yes...yes, please."</p> <p>"I want you to come inside me. I want to feel you in me," she said as she looked into my eyes again. Her hand stroked faster now.</p> <p>"But I don't know...this would be awkward."</p> <p>"We'll work together," she said. "There is no way I can leave you in the same state, right now."</p> <p>"I would love to. We can work together."</p> <p>"I'm sure." She sat back up, pulling my cock out of her pussy, and then turning into an upside down V.</p> <p>"Let's do this!" she said as she jumped off of me, crawling to me and pulling me up onto the bed with her.</p> <p>She pushed me down on my back and quickly straddled me. My cock was pointing straight up in the air as her wet pussy slid down over me. She was panting as she felt my cock slide deep inside of her.
