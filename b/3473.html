Then she got a funny look on her face, and it was obvious I had hurt her, and it wasn't on to well...</p> <p>"Oh, sweetheart," she said softly. "I love you so much, and we really haven't done a very good job at all."</p> <p>I'm not sure what I was thinking. Did I just say that?</p> <p>I think we were both crying, and we kissed for a few minutes; then we got dressed and went back to our own car and started driving back home, all thoughts of the day gone.</p> <p>After a few moments, I noticed something on the seat next to me, and I looked. It had a couple of drops of her juice on it, and they smelt strongly of strawberries.</p> <p>"It looks like your cum has been left in her pussy," I said, as I sat down on the bench behind her, and rubbed her pussy. Her vagina was still wet. "You're sure she enjoyed it."</p> <p>"Of course," was the reply, and I began rubbing her again.</p> <p>Jaz leaned over and kissed me, and then went in the house as I lay on the bed, kissing her and telling her how much I loved her. We showered together, and then went to bed. Then we fucked again, and again she rode my dick.</p> <p>It was dark outside when we finally finished. I slept on the couch, and Jaz made up the couch. This time she woke me up with a huge kiss.</p> <p>"You're so sweet tonight. My pussy feels so good on your dick!" she said, looking at me intently. It seemed like she was undressing me right in our bedroom, and I had a major erection again.</p> <p>She got on her knees after the kiss and straddled me, which I thought was kind of a good idea. She didn't just take me in her mouth, but had her pussy right in my face and was holding me there with both of her hands.</p> <p>She kissed my ear, running her tongue around it. It tickled at the rim, and she slid her other hand under her butt-end until I felt her hand on the small of my back, and then she slid her ass right up onto me, then took me as deep as possible.</p> <p>She had me in her mouth again. It felt as good as I remembered, and I began to thrust in her, trying to get as much as she could into her throat. She took me in her mouth, and started going up and down, moaning with me in her mouth.</p> <p>"Come on, baby," I said, pulling her off of me. She kissed me again, as her hand went under her, to feel my cock. "We could use a little lubrication," she said, as she played with herself under my cock.</p> <p>She straddled me, again, so that her mouth was in contact with my dick, which was still exposed from her position on my cock. She got on her hands and knees, and her head was still over me.</p> <p>"Do you mind?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not at all," I replied. She put my cock into her mouth again, and started sucking away again.</p> <p>This time though, the blowjobs weren't all that long, and the feeling of her mouth on me was a real turn-on. I began thrusting harder into her mouth and throat, while Jaz worked her pussy into some of my more familiar sensations.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me, Jaz?" I asked. I was right on the edge there, and I could not hold back.</p> <p>"Oh, you know I do!" she said, and she started shaking all over, which I liked.</p> <p>"Do me again!" I said, just as she reached down and had an orgasm. Now we were both getting close, and I knew I wasn't going to last too long.</p> <p>She lifted her head, her hand still under her ass-end, and pointed it right at my dick, as I had one hand under her, playing with her hair. I spurted my cum out into her mouth, which she closed down onto me, as I had one long, hard spurt in her mouth.</p> <p>"Don't swallow it!" Jaz cried, and tried to getâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
