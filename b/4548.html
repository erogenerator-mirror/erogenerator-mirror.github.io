We did. And we are going to do it again, tonight. And we are going to do it now," I replied, and she nodded.</p> <p>I slid into her mouth, and began making my way to her throat. I began licking her throat and shoulders, then down her neck, my eyes never leaving hers. I began to make circles around her breasts, and she began to breathe faster than me. Her nipples were stiff and full, and I wanted to give them much attention, as I licked down to her navel and she shivered. I slid up her body, until my head came within range of her nipples, and I began to kiss her gently, then lightly, then firmly. She sighed, and took my head in her hands, and we began to devour each other as I slid back to her cunt, still making circles around the outside of it, then back to her nipples. When I was again between her legs, she reached her hand back and pressed my head hard into where I could not reach. She was almost there already, but I didn't want her to come down until she did, and I wanted to taste her again. I slid back, and kissed her face.</p> <p>"Not yet," she moaned, "but I will be, eventually." With that, she lifted herself from me, sat back down on the bed, and I slid myself back into her. The first stroke was slow, but the third, and fourth, and then five, and then she was urging me to set up my rhythm, so she could meet. I complied, feeling the vibrations of her thighs on my thighs, my back against hers, her breasts against my hands. We fucked like that for the next hour, making love, fucking, fucking, fucking, until finally she began to tremble, and I felt the beginning of me coming, and I started to move faster and harder. As she arched her body, I exploded in her, and I felt her pussy walls tighten, then release, and her cum began to run down and drip onto me, drenching my cock. We both moaned, and she leaned back against me, kissing me hard, until I slipped from her to lie beside her.</p> <p>I must have passed out, because we were awakened by my alarm, and we had to shower, and get ready. Her body was gorgeous, and I could not begin to imagine what would come next. When we returned to the house, she was wearing just a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. The front belonged to me, and she handed me the keys, and a piece of paper.</p> <p>"Will you be seeing me again? I'm sure my body isn't too worn out, and I could use one more one of those nights," she told me. I thanked her again, and we headed to the door. We kissed good-bye, and she left, promising to return again someday.</p> <p>When she got there, she was sitting on a couch, nude and smiling. I joined her and they began to make out again. As we continued the kissing, she leaned back down into the corner of the couch, and I slid into her from behind, again in the same pose, with her legs wide apart, resting on my thighs. I began to pound into her pussy, loving the feeling of my cock going in and out, in and out, going into her until I felt I couldn't hold on any more, and I began to shoot my come into her, feeling the contractions of her walls on my cock, as her orgasm shook me. I rolled off her and collapsed on the couch beside her, both of us caught in a peaceful state. I fell asleep as she leaned over to kiss me. I couldn't help myself, and reached for her, pulling her into my armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
