But as far as I know, it's still a hotel. We're renting it out."</p> <p>"The next stop?" She asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I offered. "The hotel is only a few miles down and if we go there we'll have one hour to get there. It doesn't look like a long drive."</p> <p>"That's good to know," she said, hugging me a little tighter. "And when you're done, can you buy us one round to eat and we can drop us off at our place?"</p> <p>"I'll take care of that," I said, kissing her softly. "But I can't stay at this place all day! I hope you won't want to go home."</p> <p>"Oh, you're not leaving?" she laughed. "It's alright with me if you don't. But that doesn't mean I can stay!" she squealed and I was all smiles. We quickly set up some small table cloths and I had a drink waiting for us with breakfast before the day was over. We talked while we ate. I learned that Cindy had been a dancer in college and was the instructor as well as the teacher.</p> <p>By the time we had finished what we had in our stomachs and cleaned up the dishes, we were ready to meet back up with the group at the restaurant. We agreed to meet back up again at the restaurant at 7.30 that night, with about seven more arriving within the hour. I had already reserved another table off the corner of the restaurant where it would be open to anyone but me. Once the group had settled down, we all sat down and continued with the meal without any talk about what we ate.</p> <p>We sat around the table talking and watching the other people. After dinner, we got up, went to the elevator again, and waited for 7:30 to arrive. When we got there, we stood up and started to get out of the booth. Two young men were coming in the door, obviously from outside the restaurant. They both went to join us, and within a few seconds, they were standing in front of us.</p> <p>The young man who had approached us had to reach out to my hand to help me out of the booth, and then he held me in his arms.</p> <p>"Are your parents home?" he asked, peering into my eyes.</p> <p>"Not yet," I smiled, placing my small hand on his hard chest and moving my fingers down just a little bit to caress his nipple through his thin shirt. "I wish I'd waited a little longer to go home before coming back."</p> <p>"So much for waiting!" the young man behind me laughed. "But that's what a long flight brings."</p> <p>As I finished talking, I turned to see Cindy holding her arm out in front of her and smiling at me. She was leaning in slightly and her breasts were now touching my arm.</p> <p>"It's fine," she said. "You are so very welcome. You're a nice young man."</p> <p>After the young man had kissed her a long time, the young man had turned to leave. As the young man looked at me, I turned to see a couple that I remembered had come in with a group of women for some drinks. They'd brought a couple of drinks, and one looked like it could get a crowd drunk.</p> <p>I wasn't sure what I thought, but it only lasted a minute or two. I was a bit embarrassed to be in public with two young men who I had just met. But they seemed to have a hard time accepting my presence, so I just walked with them to my room. It was fairly dark and they were still in their bikinis.</p> <p>"Come on, honey," I said, helping Cindy to her feet. "Our table is a couple of tables away." We walked a few steps and stood next to each other at the edge of the room before we stood up again. Our knees touched as we approached our respective table.</p> <p>When I sat down, we didn't speak. Our lips were close together, and both of our tongues met to join in our kiss. Our hands were on each other's shoulders and our kisses grew even stronger and hotter, until our lips were parted and we pulled each other up to our lips and continued to kiss.</p> <p>"Now I really hate to break it, but what if I told you that you're the first guy I saw in months that you have been with a woman?" I laughed.</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry about that. And if I could be the last, I know they wouldn't even kiss me," she said to me. "So, if you really weren't ready to be any girl's toy, what makes you think that I would doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
