I replied without much enthusiasm.</p> <p>"Really?!?" asked the other man as he continued to play with his cock</p> <p>"She doesn't want to touch it... not yet... but she won't stop being so turned on by the feel of it. She hasn't even gotten to suck it yet... and she's gonna suck it until it explodes... then... she's gonna swallow it."</p> <p>"So what if she doesn't want to..."</p> <p>"No she's not gonna. You're only doing this for the thrill, and because of that, she's your whore..."</p> <p>The man's comment seemed to confirm that a lot of the excitement that they heard about was true as I had never been with a woman before, and although I loved the thought of me sucking off other men, what she had just said made me want to be their sub for life!</p> <p>"Yes... I'm a whore and you're going to be my girl... no, I'm not going to let a man do that to her... she's yours, isn't she?" I finished with a smile</p> <p>"She is..." was he going to say more?</p> <p>"Yes, and you better believe she wants to..."</p> <p>"No... that won't happen. I can't make it just for you..." he was talking to himself for a moment.</p> <p>"Well I want to..." I said</p> <p>To the point of it, I was trying to talk with an almost hypnotic voice.</p> <p>"Please... suck my cock now... I need to be hard again..."</p> <p>He didn't need any help getting into position. He took his cock in his hand and gently rubbed it up and down between my legs, rubbing my lips and clit. I was already extremely excited and it felt so good!</p> <p>"My turn... I get that..." said the man</p> <p>With that the man got behind me and slowly lowered his cock to my opening. A moment later an enormous cock entered me and drove in as far as it could. Once again I came on the first thrust.</p> <p>"She has never wanted anything like this... I want this..." he said to the man behind me. "But you can't have it... I'm your whore... this will be your last session before you lose your job. I will have my way with you..."</p> <p>He thrust forward with all his force and was soon going as deep as I could take. Each thrust produced a moan from my mouth.</p> <p>"Oh you are a whore, aren't you? You like my cock fucking you, don't you? You like being fucked in the ass?"</p> <p>"Yes... I love it!" I could feel myself building up to climax, and he continued. All ten inches of him were inside me before he pulled back then plunged straight back in. I started to move my hips back to meet his each time he drove home. It was such a turn on to know that someone might have done this to me... and they just happened to enjoy it in the best way possible!</p> <p>When he reached that point of no return, I felt him start to shudder again... he had already experienced a major sensation. He pulled out slightly, then plunged back in once again, giving me almost a double thrill of the feeling. In a few more minutes his body started to shake as he shot off inside me.</p> <p>"Ohhhh... this is how you have wanted it for soooo much... now take it... I am finally coming on this cock..."</p> <p>It was only a few thrusts when I felt him starting to soften and pull out of me. I was very grateful that the man I was sitting opposite had not stopped him by his knees. I rolled myself back onto my back.</p> <p>"Honey, you didn't even have to do anything that would cause you to be horny for a woman... and I thought you wanted to have a threesome with them. You just needed some time to recover."</p> <p>"I was horny for it..."</p> <p>"You certainly don't need to talk about it before you make up to me!" I said as I sat up and kissed him.</p> <p>"Just remember that I am yours now... in any way you choose..."</p> <p>He smiled as he pulled his cock out of me and stroked it, making it twitch.</p> <p>"You can kiss me whenever you like. Just remember to keep these things between us... I will be back to do whatever it is for you."</p> <p>We kissed for several minutes. The feeling of his fingers on my back was incredible. He was still breathing heavily and I could see his hands moving all over me. When we were finished, I got up off the bed.</p> <p>"Please, let's start back to your bathroom when you're gone... I could really use a shower though..." I said as I turned my head leftâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
