"Not that I don't like that part."</p> <p>"It's fine," she said. "I'll get you everything you want at the same time." Just before I left the kitchen, I turned, and took my new keys, unlocked the door and stepped outside.</p> <p>As I walked to the curb, I thought about the weekend on the weekend. Everything in the week seemed to be the same. The same routine. The same events. The same people.</p> <p>My mind wandered as we got out of the car heading towards the house.</p> <p>"So, when does we get married?" she asked. My lips twitched, and I gave her a quick kiss.</p> <p>"The ceremony will take place on Saturday, I think."</p> <p>"That will suit me perfectly. Just like it did last night after all this time."</p> <p>"Yeah. You just need to take a break between now and then."</p> <p>"Oh, I'll try." We hugged and kissed, and the next day she told me the whole story, which I'll never forget.</p> <p>It's been three long years, and the reunion is still a couple of months away. We both had some family business to handle. We're happy, she says, and I'm still the same sweet, innocent little girl from college... until I decide just to get out.</p> <p>Chapter Two: New Year's Eve</p> <p>In October we were out having a meal at a local steakhouse, just on the outskirts of town... then back home to celebrate. We had a small crowd of friends, and I was sure that if we went dancing later for fun it would make it to our party.</p> <p>However, it was hard because it was the biggest birthday of my life! As luck would have it, there's a big party on Halloween night. We got up, gathered up our coats and walked to the party. I had a few things I wanted to take to the party, and was going to be a little early, so I got the girls in the kitchen before the party started.</p> <p>When I was pulling up, I stopped to let the girls get out from under a pile of dishes. I couldn't stand it. The night was going to end soon if I couldn't do something about myself. I walked to the kitchen without looking back. As I passed by, the girls started to take off their coats and put them into the dishwasher. It wasn't my birthday, but it happened. I was standing in the kitchen getting all the dishes turned in when there was a knock on the door.</p> <p>"Hello, come in." It was the first thing I looked at, but I figured it would be my dad, so I took a deep breath and went to the door to see what his reaction would be if he saw me enter. He seemed not to notice, but then said good-bye to me like yesterday.</p> <p>"Well, I guess I'm getting there..." I thought back to the last time I came knocking on the door at night, and how it was all I could think about at that moment. I knew that this was probably the only time I would get a good night's sleep before I was leaving for summer. And my dreams were the worstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
