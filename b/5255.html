"It was nice to meet you myself."</p> <p>"Nice to meet you, too. I have been told that I am most welcome here. It is a shame that he has lost so much as a wife who can't have kids. That is a sad moment really."</p> <p>"Why don't you go on and take a bath. It will make you feel better."</p> <p>"Yes, of course."</p> <p>"Do you know what has happened to you?"</p> <p>"Yes. It is me. I did not want to do that, but I can't do that to anyone who tries to take advantage of me. I am very depressed. What are you going to do?"</p> <p>"We haven't done anything in a long time. We need to take my mind off of that. We have just had the most powerful sexual experience of our lives."</p> <p>"You have said no to this part of the conversation."</p> <p>"I just didn't want to bring up my relationship with him and it would make us both feel bad."</p> <p>"There is a fine line between what is right and what is not. You are a free spirit and the choice is yours. Go to the bathroom. I will get the soap."</p> <p>"Oh! Where is the soap and shampoo?"</p> <p>"Just come to the counter there. I'm going to wash your body."</p> <p>I thought about it and decided to do it, as long as I was happy. I turned over on my stomach and put my face in the soapy water. She was watching me while I washed myself. I thought about turning around to see what she would do next, but I decided to try.</p> <p>When I was finished washing myself, I turned around. She was waiting, naked, in the living room. She had put on a sheer robe. She was looking at me as I finished washing myself.</p> <p>"I am very pleased to be in your presence. I am also very sad that we will have to go through this. I don't want there to be a repeat of that evening."</p> <p>"The last time I came here with my heart broken, I got raped."</p> <p>"I'm glad you did not." She kissed me and went on to clean herself. When she finished, she stood in the middle of the living room, facing me.</p> <p>"Did you get as much from this conversation as I did?" she asked. I told her that they hadn't and she said that there was something she wanted me to do for her.</p> <p>She went on to explain, "I am a virgin and I'm only about twenty years of age, but it is the first time I ever touched a female's breasts. I like it when you touch me there; no, don't go there. I want your hands on me. Touch me wherever you want. I do want to feel your hands on me. Touch me wherever you want. Please touch me."</p> <p>I was totally surprised. I asked her, "What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"I want to feel you touch someplace you want to go."</p> <p>"What? Are you serious?"</p> <p>She gave me an evil look. "I know that you may think that I am evil, but I did not think that you really wanted to feel me. I want to find out what it is like to touch a woman. Let's do it now." I nodded and followed her to the door.</p> <p>In the bedroom, she was lying on the bed, spread eagle. She spread her legs. I could see where it was that I was touching. I went in on my own volition and touched her there. It was different from touching a man. It was the same. She moaned. I slowly slid my finger in and out. Her whole body convulsed and she opened her legs wide. I felt an unusual reaction from her and had no idea what was going through her mind. I continued to slide my finger in and out. I put the second digit in and she opened her eyes and looked at me. Her eyes were closed and she was biting her lip. I put my thumb on her clit and pushed it gently, gently, gently, while I pumped in and out of her. She pushed her hips upwards and let out a long moan. Her breathing was short and hard and I felt a little scared. I kept going.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" she asked.</p> <p>"Good. Much better than when I have finger-fuck someone." I was still working her clit with my thumb and then I stuck my thumb in her so far that no doubt I went a half-inch into her vagina.</p> <p>"I have never had three fingers in me."</p> <p>I looked for any kind of reaction, but only felt the pressure of her hipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
