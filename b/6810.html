This time, however, was different. Instead of being the passive recipient; I was just the one to take control. I wasn't about to surrender to an uncertain role model, and it was going to take time. For myself, I was about to be the recipient. Not just any time, though.</p> <p>For him, though, I'd been feeling almost helpless so far. Being ordered to strip for him made me more determined. I'd become his slave, his victim. To him, it was more than just his job to strip in public. It was also his job to turn me on, not the other way around.</p> <p>I was still his little slut. And now it was him who was getting naked. I was his to do with as he pleased. What was worse, he wouldn't be doing all that much work in keeping everything neat and tidy for himself.</p> <p>He was already out of his clothes and I was beginning to panic again. What if I was not the right choice for this? What if I wasn't the right one? What if the right one was right? It was all too clear that this was not going to work out. This isn't like me. This was all too real. Now, I really, really needed him to give me the confidence to do this.</p> <p>After all, what was really going to happen was going to happen. So, to get started as I should be, I took his cock in my hand and began to jerk him off. It wouldn't be too hard for me, in that he wouldn't be too hard for me. I'd have to be the one to do this by pulling on them. For that, I began to squeeze them so I could feel his hardness with my fingertips.</p> <p>For a woman as beautiful and smart as I am, I found this task quite fascinating. I was so fascinated by his manly length that I didn't even notice before the first drop of come left my mouth.</p> <p>If I was his slave, however, I was his slave to do with as he pleased. He had that right. I was his little slut and he could do with me as he wished. In the future, I knew he would be doing all the work.</p> <p>I hadn't had a chance to consider the idea fully since that night and just now that it had suddenly come up in my subconscious. I had not really considered that until now. It had been a one-time experience and one of my most humiliating sexual experiences.</p> <p>I had been naked, masturbating and sucking him as he had told me to do. But that was all a moment ago and it hadn't happened so much. Tonight, in front of him, I was his to do whatever he liked. I was his victim.</p> <p>While I enjoyed the feel of his hardness in my hand and the other in mine, I had not really thought of what it meant to me to be owned. In the few moments of this trip, I had been feeling an uncertain excitement and a sense that I might be a willing subject to some of his ideas. That had been the point of no return, after all. I hadn't really thought about it. Now, I had to concentrate, I told myself, to be honest. I couldn't tell the difference.</p> <p>I turned to him. "You're going to do this," I said, in a tone of voice I thought he might hear. "I'm going to do it. The sooner the better."</p> <p>I didn't actually say that I was going to do it. I said "I'll do it." I really meant it. I couldn't tell who'd said what, although the context was somewhat ambiguous.</p> <p>For a few moments, he'd been silent and I'd had to wonder if he was actually going to do it. I had to wonder if he could actually be convinced.</p> <p>Then, I looked him straight in the eye, and said, "Come on. Hurry your cock." I put my arm around his neck and pulled him towards me. "Come on," I said with a laugh. "I know you can feel me on you. I know you can smell me. I know you can see me and you will. I know you're going to feel me against you. I know you'd want me. I know you would love me." I kissed him, hard and quick, and that was all it took.</p> <p>In an instant I'd driven myself right to the point that all thought left me. I needed to do this. I needed her to feel it was for her alone, not to be controlled by me. I needed to be obedient, compliant to her.</p> <p>I pulled his face toward me and kissed him. I made no effortâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
