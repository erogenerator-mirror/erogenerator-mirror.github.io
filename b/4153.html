We spent hours talking, mostly on how well we did to get this project to a close. We didn't want any secrets, so I made sure that she was really open about her personal life, and about me. She was very interested in all of it but she was a bit embarrassed of all of it. So, one day after we finished our conversation, I took her on an errand and brought her home with me. We made love, and I fucked her silly, and she was happy to see that I was proud of my work. Then, I gave her the opportunity to see what other women thought of her, so she could see for herself. Then you can imagine how happy she was when I walked her out to her car and told her to take care of everything. You get the picture, then I got the present, here in this lovely hotel on Second Street. I told her to let me watch her on the way home.</p> <p>So, when I walked her home from work that evening I told her that she needed to be more honest with herself and the boys, and that I loved her very much but I really loved the sex with you, my dear. She smiled and thought, God, do I love you too, but I know she really does need to be told, that being a girl can turn guys on but it probably doesn't cause the boy and girl to get upset. Anyway, after we got to her house and she had some wine, she told me all about her life with men. She explained how much she had enjoyed, and that the men in her life were always good looking. She loved their body and her girlfriends too, and she told me a little about that. She said that she had been the subject of countless sexual dreams in her past. I was surprised, but didn't be surprised. So, after she had wine and thought for a while, I took her upstairs to the bedroom. I told her that I was ready, I really was ready. So, I took my clothes off, and, then, I climbed into bed and made love to my dear wife. So, after I had her again, I took her some more. Now I'm not too experienced, and you know how I make love, so I didn't do this, but I enjoyed myself. She had really turned me on and had a good time. That time was memorable. When she woke up the next morning, she looked really tired and sad. I held her for a while, then, I really did. Then, she asked me who I was, and I told her. She looked at me in amazement. I went on to explain her to me the way I felt about you. She didn't need to think that I had been cheating on her, she just went on and on and there was nothing else I could think of to tell her. She didn't want to hear what I had to say, but the truth in it sounded good. She didn't feel any differently, so I told her that after she had had that first orgasm that evening, she should get started. Anyway, she didn't need any lessons, she just wanted to try it again. She never would have done it, and didn't want to see her husband upset. So, when it was over, she asked me if I could get another one. I told her that I'd probably do it. So, when this guy showed up on her doorstep later that night, I got a surprise. I guess what I mean is that I don't know what it was that I had just done, but I was able to do it again when I had a great time. She never wanted to hear it from me, she just loved how it turned out, and it was wonderful." Then, I paused and continued, "My dear, you know some women do feel that way. Anyway, I guess some of us girls just don't find a man attractive. You didn't seem to have much of a case for being a slut at that stage in your life. So, what did you have in mind?"</p> <p>"Oh, I had to start, and the way I thought about it later that night, you really are a wonderful guy."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Oh. yes, that would be great. I can't wait to see you again." Then, I paused. "I'm sure if that was your idea, you must have thought of some way that I could do that with you. Did you ever think of what might happen there?"</p> <p>"Well, yes, but that would certainly be in our way. For the time being, I don't want to have to feel about sex with you either."</p> <p>"What? That might be best just to let you know. There are some things that are just for you. I mean, for me, the sex thing is, at least, the most important part of sex.
