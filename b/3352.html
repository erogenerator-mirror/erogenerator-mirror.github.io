It’s for my pleasure I think’t it. It’s for yours, honey. I think your cock will please you the way you make me want it so much.”</p> <p>“I see, you like having all these cocks to play with?”</p> <p>“Of course. Of course, it’s for my pleasure. I’m getting used to the thought of all those big cocks in me. It’s the only way to keep them satisfied. But even with the big ones they always want more and, most of the time, don’t mind if I cum. It might seem a little mean and crude to take their mind off the situation, but it’s a lot of fun to play with them and I’m so glad you agree.”</p> <p>“I agree, too. I love sucking off such big cocks. I know it’s hard for me, but I love it. And you’d better get to work because I’ve got to be home in a little while. Have a good time, sweetie.”</p> <p>When I arrived home, I didn’t see Lisa anywhere so I changed into a pair of jeans and put them on. I grabbed my overnight bag and headed off to her place. Once I pulled up to the door, I saw that there was some junk up there, but I didn’t care about that. I just had to take advantage of what the house was all about. As I was about to knock on the door, I saw Lisa's car on the driveway, but I didn’t bother ringing the doorbell. Instead, I headed down to the kitchen and poured herself a couple of glasses of wine. While I was fixing a pot of tomato soup, I looked over at Lisa and I was surprised to see her there.</p> <p>Lisa has long brown hair, which she usually wears up in a bun. It had been pulled back from her face, and her bangs were done up in some pretty neat knots so that it hung down her back. She was sitting at the kitchen table taking one or two bites out of her chicken. As she did so her arms hung loosely in front of her chest. Her short-cropped hair had fallen out of its comb-like ponytail and I could make out the deep circles of her areolae.</p> <p>“Good morning,” Lisa said as she sat down at the table. I was looking at her in her dark clothes, but from what I could see of her, she was wearing a red satin robe, which was tied at the waist, which was loose and flowing down her body all the way to just below her hips. As she sat down her robe drifted open a bit exposing her breasts. Her breasts were small and firm, but her areolae were well formed compared to her body, while her areolae and nipples were large and dark and erotically swollen. The robe hung down from her waist, over the swell of her hips. She still had her legs crossed, one high heel on her right foot, while the other was sticking out of the opening at the top of her robe.</p> <p>As I noticed Lisa’s legs move her left leg out, I noticed the robe open a bit more to the side when she sat down. My cock got a bit stiffer just from seeing that. She saw me looking, and her smile told me how much she liked my attention.</p> <p>“Thanks,” Lisa said. “I needed that last one to wake me up to get my work done,” she said and then leaned forward to offer me a quick kiss.</p> <p>“That’s OK, honey, I didn’t have to. I took care of you. I love you,” I said as we kissed. I felt her hand cup the side of my face and then I felt two of her fingernails brush lightly across the side of it. She looked up at me with eyes that told me she had found some kind of power over me that she could see. As I stood up and grabbed her hand, she pulled her own body closer to mine, and I slid my hands up her thighs, through her robe, and then up inside her robe, pressing them against her belly which she had opened a bit more the last few nights.</p> <p>I could feel the weight of the robe lying against the swell of her breasts. Her nipples were larger than they ever have been before, and when I leaned forward to kiss her while I fondled her breasts, they immediately grew. My cock was beginning to stir, and I was tempted to take Lisa by her hands and lead her to my place, but I just couldn—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
