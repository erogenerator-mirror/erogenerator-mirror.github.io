We haven't done much at college though."</p> <p>"What? Don't let me go to college, you idiot!"</p> <p>"Not right now, but I'm going to anyway; just wait." Then he leaned over the pool table and picked up a bottle of oil and walked to the pool table. He turned it on. Then he began to oil his hands.</p> <p>"God you're hot!" he said and reached over. He pulled my head off of the pool table. He kissed me, then began to move it down my body; over my ass, down my legs, and lower. When he was down to my feet and I was lying on the table with my head in his crotch. He began to massage my feet and I felt it tickling me. As he began to massage my feet, he got up off of the table and went into the bathroom. He came out a minute later with two candles.</p> <p>"I'm going to get out of this suit and come take a shower."</p> <p>He handed me the bottle of oil and said, "come, undress and join me. While I'm showering your back I've got to have a good look at you and take a shower; it's one in a while."</p> <p>"So?" I asked.</p> <p>"So, what? Just sit there."</p> <p>"Just sit there and watch."</p> <p>"Sit there and watch what?"</p> <p>"Watch me get ready."</p> <p>Just about that time, he returned to the bathroom, closed the door so that we couldn't hear the shower, and came back out. He had a towel, wet-look, but no shower cap. He began to towel my body.</p> <p>"Just a little hair removal. You look beautiful."</p> <p>"I think I look sexy to myself." He said.</p> <p>"I'm going to have dinner with you, get something to eat before dinner." He told me. Then he kissed me. "Come on."</p> <p>I did as he asked and we got to eat dinner together. It wasn't very interesting. It wasn't too good either, so he said, "You look like a nice lady." I was wearing an outfit that looked like it would be hot. He took his towel off and sat me down at the table.</p> <p>"I thought we were going to be a family, right?" he said.</p> <p>"That's not it; we can talk about that when we're done."</p> <p>He was right. He went into the other room and came out with a bottle of wine in his hand. "Here's my treat" and he poured us each a glass. "Cheers. Thank you very much."</p> <p>I said. "You're welcome; I'm starving."</p> <p>I finished my wine and we went back to talk; the subject of college came up. He told me about his experience in college, how some of the guys there, had "adventured" in that area.</p> <p>"All that went well, was that you were one of the hottest girls at college?"</p> <p>"Yeah. There were a lot of guys there, but I never made the list."</p> <p>We finished our dinner and I went out to change into a sundress and we walked out to the pool before he got out. He started to get out of the pool, but I said something to go with it.</p> <p>"Please. Let me go change." I said.</p> <p>"No, not yet, I want you to meet some new guys." He said.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"I'll see you later."</p> <p>After watching him walk away I went out to see what he was doing at his office. It turned out that he had been in one of the classrooms during the day and had lost his clothes. When I arrived I found him talking to a very cute blonde about 5'5", about 150lb. "Hi, I'm Brenda."</p> <p>She smiled and looked at me like I was her next meal.</p> <p>"Nice to meet you," she said, extending her hand.</p> <p>We shook hands and she gave me a little hug then went on to tell him about her college experience.</p> <p>The story continues:</p> <p>Brenda's story:</p> <p>I was looking out my window from the kitchen window when I felt a hand on my shoulder. A man's hand touched my shoulder when the hand fell.</p> <p>"Excuse me. What do you say you come back in to the kitchen and we'll get something to eat. We can talk about college and what to expect after college. What do you think?"</p> <p>My mind raced.
