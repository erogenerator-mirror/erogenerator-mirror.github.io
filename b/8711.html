"I've got to get off of the bed right now! You got room for the night?"</p> <p>"Yeah, thanks!" he smiled and pulled off his shirt. He got onto the bed and looked down at my naked body. It's been a while. I didn't wake up until about 7:30.</p> <p>"I don't want us to see each other," he whispered, "but... well, I don't want to hurt you. I want you to stay here. Please."</p> <p>He was still naked as he sat on the side of the bed. He pulled me onto his lap and began lightly stroking my face and neck. That felt nice! I pulled the covers over my hips and he continued to caress my neck, my jaw, my cheek, and my lips. When I reached for him he quickly moved away, and sat up. I was breathing heavily, and I pulled him to me, still naked, and kissed his lips and his chest. His lips were soft and gentle, but he gave me a sweet, loving, long kiss. I rolled onto my back and put my head on the pillow.</p> <p>"Wanna go to the bathroom to pee?" I asked. "Before I go."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," he agreed.</p> <p>He pulled back the covers and climbed on top of me. He slowly began rubbing the head of his cock against my face. It felt so good, it was such a turn-on.</p> <p>"I've been wanting to do this for a long time, I just didn't know how to get you to do it first," I said. "Do you want me to do it for you, Baby?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, please!"</p> <p>"Are you sure you can't wait for me to do it for you?" I smiled.</p> <p>"Honey, you're gonna make love to me again!" he laughed. "I'm so horny! It's been 2 days! I'm gonna cum if you do that."</p> <p>"Just wait, Baby!" I said enthusiastically. I was looking forward to it! I lifted my legs and pushed my knees to his shoulders.</p> <p>"Ahhh!" he groaned. It was so nice feeling my hot wetness wrapped around and around his cock. He reached down and held me. It wasn't that I couldn't, but I didn't want this to end. With that he got up and went to the bathroom. He returned a minute later with a warm washcloth and wiped off my face, neck, and down over my breasts. He was really good with my breasts. He gently rubbed and massaged them.</p> <p>"That felt wonderful!" I moaned. I was going to have a nice time.</p> <p>"I don't know how it happened. Do I make you cum? Or you make yourself cum again? That feels so good!" he laughed, "This time I feel so guilty and so young!"</p> <p>"Oh yes," I moaned, "Yes, yes! You make my body feel so young!"</p> <p>He put down the washcloth and began licking and sucking my breasts. I was moaning with pleasure. I knew I was going to cum again, and had to stop to get a condom on.</p> <p>"How do you want me to put my cock in?" he asked.</p> <p>"Let's just do it at first. I won't get pregnant. I think the last thing I want to do is get pregnant. I'm not on the pill. That's not right!"</p> <p>"Honey," he smiled, "I just want to make this for you; I'm not going to tell anyone."</p> <p>He began rubbing the tip of his hard cock up and down my slit. I gasped when he slid his head to the opening of my vagina. He slowly started sliding into my soaking hot body. "Oh, God!" I moaned. I reached down and rubbed my clit.</p> <p>"Slow down a bit, Baby," he urged. "Make it last!"</p> <p>I slowly started working more of his cock into me. He was going slow, so I'd want to feel more of his hard young man-meat inside me! He gently caressed my breasts.</p> <p>"This feels good," I whispered.</p> <p>It felt awesome. It felt so nice, he said. That felt so nice! I'm gonna cum all over if you keep playing with my boobs!"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, Baby. I'm gonna cum all over you!"</p> <p>Just as I was going to cum, the door opened and a man got up. "Ah, you were there." He smiled.</p> <p>"What do you need, Baby?" he askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
