Here, you can take off your dress, lay down on the table for a bit and I'll just give you some time to catch up. Now go and sit yourself down and have a chat; maybe a little of anything you'd like to say."</p> <p>I did as instructed to see what he had in mind for us all to do after dinner, and although I really wanted to be with him right now, I wasn't quite sure there was any way I could ever fulfil those urges that had crept up on me so recently. I decided to wait there and enjoy the rest of the evening with myself and as a final gesture to myself the little pangs of guilt I had felt for having the affair with Simon once again swelled within me to the max and although the guilt over my unfaithfulness was still too fresh to me, at least it seemed like one little more day had passed.</p> <p>I waited nervously by the door, wondering just exactly what had been said as he'd continued to explain about having found the right man at the right time to bring him closer to the relationship. I still didn't feel sure of the meaning of it all; Simon had been there for me; was it a way for him to take advantage of me in return?</p> <p>I was starting to get more and more nervous about where things might be going at dinner. What was this all about, what was now just a part of what I'd always wanted?</p> <p>"OK, what would you like to eat?" Simon wanted to know just yet.</p> <p>I looked at him and said, "I thought I'd find something to eat."</p> <p>"A bit of something for you to eat, but just as a little reward. What would you like from me or someone else, it's up to you really. "</p> <p>"I'd like to stay home with you while you are home - and I do mean stay home"</p> <p>"Good choice" was his reply. "But that can't be as nice as you like?"</p> <p>All of this was new to me - now I was being forced to accept that Simon was going to take me into his bedroom for the night and I had to submit myself to him in the same way he would if that was what he wanted and needed and now he wanted to take me as his property. But would I be his and be his only. Maybe he'd find out what he wanted me to do at the next place, as he'd hinted at in the text; I couldn't tell.</p> <p>"We'll see tomorrow then" I smiled.</p> <p>"Good" was all Simon said as he left the kitchen.</p> <p>"I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow" I said as I headed into the living room.</p> <p>"Good" was all he said as I made my way across the hallway to the bedroom.</p> <p>"OK, let's find out what's on offer" I said after a short and uncomfortable pause.</p> <p>It was only then that I began to contemplate what might be in store.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
