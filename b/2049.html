I would have probably hit an iceberg, I guess, since I was young and didn't fit the mold of my peers. What I would have gone on to do was get my feet lifted and move into the world.</p> <p>My dad was a sports nut who had been part of the local gym, but had also earned a good working out at a local facility back when he was in his late thirties and early forties.</p> <p>It was a fairly easy job, and I had a very good career taking classes in sports, but my interest got better in life than just partying and partying. I was just learning.</p> <p>I had no interest in the gym when I started working there for a while, mostly just to be comfortable around others and relax.</p> <p>I was going to try to move into the area, which was only about twelve miles from home. The area we were headed next door to was quite secluded and very remote. One of my first responsibilities was to take some exercise when I was in the area. That might have brought on some confusion if I had considered it, but it turned out not so much.</p> <p>My first session with Mark didn't pay very much attention to me, which I could not say about my dad. He was very good, really, but he had not got to as much as my mom.</p> <p>Being the newbie in my business, I made my own set of mistakes over the next couple of years or so. Mark gave me great coaching and I was learning fast.</p> <p>Mark, however, was also very busy. He was out of shape, working on long hours, and had a few nights to himself on Fridays. He was also always at home, studying or just going to the gym, when I was out. (Yes, I was home, of course, but there was a bit of a gap of time between the home and the gym, which only happened at weekends.)</p> <p>He did something similar to me at home. He never went out on Saturday evening, or late Thursday or Friday, which was when he went out. He was in some heavy activity, which took away any sleep I might have had.</p> <p>One evening at the gym he came in and sat down, with me sitting there with him.</p> <p>"Hey, Rob. Whatcha doing? You aren't back yet. I know I told you that you had a week before you did. I have another one of my gym appointments coming up, so I need you to go along."</p> <p>"It will be okay, Dad. Besides, if I don't get something done soon, I might not be doing too bad." I laughed as I thought it, knowing how much the gym crowd hated that. Mark could hardly take it, since his was his entire personal life that I had.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, "I'll call you if I need you."</p> <p>Mark had always been a handsome man, and the last time I had seen him in any kind of uniform was on one of my many visits to his place for Christmas and New Years.</p> <p>I knew I just gave Mark up like a Christmas present. I had been in love with him for a while too, and I knew about sex, but I don't think Mark had told me. The last time he had gone out on a Friday and Saturday night is when he and I had been going out with his buddies. We had just been sitting around the house having some wine and talking. We had been kissing and touching all throughout that long weekend.</p> <p>As he came in the door, I thought I was going to have an epiphany.</p> <p>That day, on the eve of my workout, I was sitting at his table with some of his friends and family when I heard him say, "Hey, I'll meet you in the other room at one or two. I'd love to show you around the neighborhood. Just follow Mark's lead."</p> <p>"No problem," I said, jumping off the bar top and running over to the front door. I opened it as I ran out the door and down the street. There was a little white door that I unlocked when I was at home, and I wondered if I could even get it open to slip inside. I just walked off down the block.</p> <p>I heard Mark and his friends talking about him and how that he made a huge hit with his buddies as he went about his business, and I heard someone's voice in my ear as I ran towards the front door. Once Mark got the door opened, he was all over me and I was in seventh heaven.</p> <p>Mark was a man of the world. My father had taught me that I shouldn't ever look at a man with a look like Mark. I looked over at him, and I found him looking at me with a kind of amusement inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
