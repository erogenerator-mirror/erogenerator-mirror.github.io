"It's not right for women to act the way they do if they are unhappy. You know we all love our women more than we'll want to admit it. Even if they've been doing the same thing as we've been doing for the longest time, in the end they'll still love us just as much."</p> <p>"But you've been the best lover in my life," she said. "You are the best of our kind."</p> <p>"So don't you accept this because you're afraid you might not be happy with us?"</p> <p>"My dear man, no, I don't. And I don't think I could ever be happy with you."</p> <p>Mike didn't respond, but instead smiled warmly at her. He looked to her, and they exchanged smiles. He leaned over and kissed her softly, and they exchanged a long moment of their lips locked. He pushed the last of his self-control away, and they rose up on their knees again, looking each other straight in the eye as they kissed. Mike's hands were on each of her soft breasts, exploring her body all over, from the belly to the belly button, down to her mound, up around her hip and onto her buttocks to pull her even closer to him, so she leaned against him. Mike rolled a condom onto his hardening cock before positioning himself at her entrance. Her legs came up to wrap themselves around his waist, and she helped him penetrate her, guiding him into the softest, most welcoming tunnel he'd ever felt.</p> <p>Mike slowly started to push himself into Emily. He was amazed by the sensation of entering her, of the warmth of her body as it enveloped him, and the pressure of her hips as she pushed back into him. She was still slightly damp, but her body felt silky smooth beneath his as she pushed back against him.</p> <p>Then Mike started pounding into her, feeling so close to him but not giving in to his body's demand. Emily let herself go on him. The world was only a fraction of his surroundings in this moment. All he could feel was her soft, loving body and the soft feel of her breasts bouncing against his chest, her thighs clutching his waist.</p> <p>Mike stopped briefly from his thrusting, and he looked down at Emily, wondering how she felt about his invasion. She'd never been quite like this, the fact that it was always so nice only a few weeks before, the feeling of her body tightening around him as he thrust inside of her. He looked to her face, and saw she was staring out the window, but also focused on what he was doing to her. She was beautiful, just the way he liked them.</p> <p>He could think of nothing he'd ever been much interested in in a woman like this. She was simply beautiful, and she made him feel so lucky to be able to share everything with her. He loved her, he wanted her, and he always wanted her. His hands were at her waist, pressing down with her hips to keep her body steady where they could take him. His hands stayed on her hips, and he pushed himself as deeply as he could within her before he pulled himself almost completely out of her, causing her to gasp, for the first time in her life, and then thrust deeply, just as the world seemed to pause in its own pleasure and give way. At the sound, Emily came, hard and loud, and Mike felt as if he had somehow been lifted from this world to come home to her.</p> <p>He felt like she had been holding him in to himself for hours, as though she were holding him as he entered her body. His hands were at her back, running up and down her sides, his fingers running down the crack of her ass. His mouth was at the back of her neck, drawing soft little moans out of her. Then he noticed something, as he was pulling out of her.</p> <p>"I know you wanted this," she said as her finger grazed the small, puckered skin just below her anus. "I knew it would feel good when I saw you on the flight. I knew you hadn't been wearing anything as I stepped inside the room." She smiled as she spoke, and then turned to look him over.</p> <p>"I've been wearing nothing since...I haven't been here very long." Mike could not bring himself to say anything as she spoke, so his words hung in the air, in limbo between what he could take from her, and what he wanted that to be true. She looked at him and smiled again. He wanted to feel closer to her, but knew that would mean he would feel closer to her. He could feel a warmth that could only come from the realization that she was so beautiful that any man would want to kiss her foreverâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
