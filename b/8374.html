She told him again.</p> <p>"It means I may lick your asshole, while you stroke your erection."</p> <p>She giggled at this new adventure. "Maybe a little lubrication is required." He teased.</p> <p>Somewhat startled she asked, "Haven you ever fucked a woman with a penis?"</p> <p>"No way my dear. What about a man? We should be careful." He suggested.</p> <p>It was a strange and curious moment for both of them. They didn't feel in a sexual way at all but neither felt a connection, no, there was never a connection! But the feelings of arousal had changed dramatically!</p> <p>So much so that she had already reached under her panties in the back seat and felt what the men had described. She remembered how the guys described their dicks. She'd had them in her panties, not her wet panties, but her hand. She found them and started exploring; touching, fondling then stroking, then caressing. It was so naughty and exciting! And then she realized what it would feel like to have a penis in her mouth - with him. That thought made her shudder!</p> <p>After many minutes of stroking each other she realized she very much needed to take off her panties for good! He lifted himself off of the seat and she reluctantly pulled her panties down her legs.</p> <p>Her pussy was hot and moist and ready by now, she had never been in a room with another person's erection before - other than her own - and her own husband's dick. It was a new, naughty feeling! She felt so alive and warm as she put the panties over her legs. It felt so good.</p> <p>"Are you getting ready to put your penis in me now?" She asked excitedly.</p> <p>"Yes, of course. I think we now need to take out the condom and put it in." He suggested.</p> <p>"Please can we put the condom on first?" She asked.</p> <p>"Of course we will, it's perfectly safe. Now, put the condom on! And turn on the light. Turn your head round; that's your best vision. And then turn on the light for me too."</p> <p>She did it, and when she turned round and got in the car he quickly slid his shorts and briefs off and she held his penis, which was now hard and sticking straight up in the air.</p> <p>"Take his hand away! I don't want the condom out of sight now!" She thought.</p> <p>He put his arm round her and kissed her ear. "I'm ready. Are you?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes, yes! I'm definitely ready!" she agreed.</p> <p>As he drove off she turned to the other side of the car. She sat there looking down at his erection in the car. Suddenly she reached out a hand and touched it. "Mmmm, it feels nice. But I think there might be another way to go!" she thought.</p> <p>She turned to face him and began to stroke his erection with her hand. It felt wonderful! She felt warm and sexy and warm! She continued stroking his erection. She wanted to make him come - she wanted to make him explode in her mouth. The car stopped and she got out. "Well, we certainly weren't expecting company. Why don't you follow me." She announced.</p> <p>They went out into the park and walked the few blocks back to her house. She had taken off her panties so they were soaked from her excitement and he could see how wet they were. "Would you like to come in my pussy again?" She wondered.</p> <p>"Is that going to happen? In the car, the park? I thought of it like this. This is our last chance!" He argued.</p> <p>"In the parking lot. In the car, we'll go. We can kiss each other, touch each other." She said.</p> <p>"But what about in the car? In the car?" He questioned.</p> <p>"Come here and kiss me again, but this time not right away. That's it! Kiss me while you slide your cock into my pussy." She wanted it more and more.</p> <p>Suddenly he heard music blaring from the CD player. "Wow!" He thought. He thought he heard a woman moaning with a man!</p> <p>Slowly it became almost an experience as he kissed her, first the right then the left. She put her arms round his neck and began to kiss him. He could feel his penis sliding through her pussy lips as he moved her body on the seat. As she did this he moved his erect penis slightly between her legs and she moved it inside her wet pussy. He could feel how hot and slick it was, how hot, wet and warm she was as she began to move herself withinâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
