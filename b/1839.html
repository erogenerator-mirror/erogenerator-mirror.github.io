He felt safe in his arms. It was the first time he had been able to do this thing with someone else. It felt like being in a real relationship. He didn't know what to do, what to do next. As her legs moved, she wrapped around him, and pushed her chest up against him. He could feel her breast press to his side as she continued to move her hips ever so slightly against him. She continued until he finally had to break the embrace to say something. Her eyes were closed in sexual bliss.</p> <p>"I'm sorry..."</p> <p>She didn't say anything. He could feel her heart racing as she waited for him to say something. He knew she hadn't said anything. The moment she finally did, every emotion was wiped out of her face and all she could say was,</p> <p>"You're beautiful."</p> <p>He didn't say anything. He just held himself close to her as she continued to move her hips in the same motion. He finally found his voice and responded,</p> <p>"It's beautiful."</p> <p>"I don't think I'll ever feel this way with anyone."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>She looked at him from the corner of her eyes. She was looking at him like she didn't think she could do that. He was looking away. It was not an easy situation to be with a woman who just let him take care of her for the night. The question was, what did she feel like with him? She wasn't sure what it was that had attracted her to him, but she couldn't put her finger on it. She felt a warm feeling between her legs. It didn't feel as if it was happening right now. It felt as if she could feel that the more she came, the more intense her feelings of arousal. She couldn't explain it, but it was a turn on. His hands were all over her. She kept moving her hips in time with his, as a slow song filled the room. She heard a smile come to his lips and then she began to sing along. She heard him singing along with her.</p> <p>"I know that you love me. I know that you need me. I know that you will always be mine. I know you want me but don't know how to get back here."</p> <p>She heard him singing along, like his own song. It felt as if it was coming from somewhere else. Her arousal was evident on many levels. She was actually feeling like she was in charge. She wanted him. She wanted him back. She wanted to be in control of the situation. She wanted to know what he felt like.</p> <p>He was looking back at her as she sang along with him. It seemed as if he were looking at the face of the woman who had never left his side before. He didn't realize how much he wanted her. She felt as if he had gone from where he had left off. He couldn't even remember any of that. It all seemed so surreal. He wondered if he would ever be able to forget that she was someone else. She wondered if her love for him would ever be enough for her. She couldn't stand to feel bad for how he treated her when this whole deal had started. No wonder she had felt that way. In his world, he had never felt she hated him. All he knew was that he loved her.</p> <p>The song was over and he sat looking at her. He saw in her eyes a sad look. It wasn't sadness at the moment, but a little sadness. He wanted to make the love they had before this night even. He looked into her eyes again. She knew how he felt about her. She knew he loved her. And she knew he was willing to give her what she was asking for. It wasn't something that was a one time thing. He said he didn't have a steady girl back home. He said he needed to make love again. He felt the urge to break the spell that had been passed between them. He knew that it had to stop now.</p> <p>He stood and leaned against the couch. He watched her come and sit next to him. They were staring at each other intently. He could feel her eyes burning into him. Everything seemed so perfect, so perfect. The moment they said "I love you" to each other, it sealed the deal between them. Her eyes were staring at the top of his head. It wasn't just him that was staring at her. She was staring right at him too. He couldn't have cared less, nor could she.</p> <p>He said "I love you too" and then he leaned in and kissed her on the mouth. She felt her heart race even faster as she responded to him. He felt her move as she kissed him.
