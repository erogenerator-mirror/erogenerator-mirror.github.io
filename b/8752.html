I didn't know how she was doing this but it was really helping me with my situation. In addition, I was starting to feel like I could get over this situation and move back into the comfort of a home where I wouldn't be alone anymore.</p> <p>She looked around before she said any words. She just looked at me and spoke first, "I'll just be the nurse."</p> <p>With that, she turned and walked off. I was in shock when she stopped and then walked back over to me giving me a gentle kiss on the lips. "Thank you," she said as she pulled away.</p> <p>Then quickly I was on another plane to where I was going to end up. And, I wasn't ready for that.</p> <p>In the end, I ended up sleeping soundly again until two in the morning when I heard a call from the nurse back at my table. I felt good from the food and the bed.</p> <p>I got up to get dressed before I knew what day it was. I went back to my room and started getting ready.</p> <p>I decided to try and figure out if I wanted to be a cop or not. I had no idea what I should be, but it was easy going. I got dressed and went out for a walk. I was not paying very close attention as I approached the front hall. There were lights all around me and a couple of women from earlier in the day standing near the door. Just as I started to get closer, I saw someone come into the doorway.</p> <p>The person was a woman. She had on this leather outfit that made her extremely tall and was really short. It was sleeveless and barely covered her breasts. The bottom half of the suit was almost to her waist. The top was a black material, with her nipples protruding out. She was wearing high white collar like type gloves. Her short nails painted on. She gave me no time to say anything as she gave me her fake to go. I followed suit by letting go as she took me inside so I couldn't see her face and to show her eyes as well. Just the sight of her almost looked intimidating.</p> <p>I noticed that a woman came out from beneath the door and had a tall black man dressed as a man. She led me around while the other was standing in the light. I was really mesmerized by her. I got up to close behind her. As I walked, my suit became more constrictive. There were times that I was nervous about her.</p> <p>She came to me and put her arms behind my waist. It was soft and warm in her hands. I stood in the light looking at her in the eyes.</p> <p>She said "Hi".</p> <p>"Hello, my name is Callie"</p> <p>We were standing there for quite awhile.</p> <p>Then she asked, "Could you tell Dr. Callie that I need to go for a while. So he can come back early to finish my treatment?"</p> <p>"No, you are fine"</p> <p>"Are you going to sleep at the hospital tonight or is your night?"</p> <p>Her voice changed as she answered.</p> <p>I didn't say anything. She said, "I don't want you going home with me."</p> <p>She reached up and put her hand down and slowly unbuttoned the top half of her jacket revealing a pair of pale green and white satin bra cups and very little pink to match.</p> <p>She started to pull me toward the door again. I stood still and continued to kiss her. Then she pulled me back and started to remove the rest of her jacket. It came sliding off without any problem. She pulled her arms up over her head. I looked down at her large breasts which were spilling out the bottom of her bodice like they were begging to be released. Her cleavage was very nice. It had the appearance of being a lot larger than her chest. She had on a low set of black and white bra and matching panties. She had on a black, half-cup bra and with her breasts bouncing out of her brassiere it was obvious she wore a bra. I could see the sides of her breast very clearly. Her nipples were protruding out of the sides of her bra cups. She pulled me onto my knees and then unzipped my pants. My dick was very hard again. She pulled my dick out as she undid the buttons on the sides of her skirt. She pulled it off along with her panties. Then she turned and said, "Come with me."</p> <p>She led me past the exam table and back to her room.
