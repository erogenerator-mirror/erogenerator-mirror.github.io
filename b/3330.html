She couldn't believe that she was having these feelings in his own house - they never actually happened.</p> <p>I'm actually going to let her do this to you if you don't pull off her panties.</p> <p>He nodded, grinning at her. They didn't move away from each other, they just stayed put.</p> <p>I'll kiss it - I'll lick it. And if I don't get my panties off within seconds of her coming, you'll know it's me in the chair.</p> <p>The other thing he said was that he would make his choice. He leaned in, touching her lips lightly with his fingertips, and she let herself be pulled toward the wall, and when he slid a leg into the chair, his hand cupped her chin, pulling it out.</p> <p>She gave a small shiver, and he pulled her around until he was sitting sideways on the armrest of the chair, facing her. His lips were at her ear, and she could hear his voice. He took her earlobe between his teeth and lightly bit down on it with his tongue as he pulled her closer until she could feel the heat of his erection against her stomach.</p> <p>Her hands went to his shoulders as her eyes rolled back. She pulled his mouth to hers and let their tongues dance with each other. His fingers slid along her arms. It was a dream-come-true for her - how had she hoped her fantasy would come true as she imagined it on her end.</p> <p>She let his lips meet hers, and soon her lips were forced around his as his tongue slid into her throat. It was like she had never imagined he would taste so good, so man enough, and, god, she would like it more every day.</p> <p>When the moment of truth came her eyes flew wide open. She was going to lose her virginity, this man's face in her pussy, and her hymen broken as they kissed, and she was going to be in pain at the end of the night.</p> <p>She didn't care. She'd do anything any man wanted.</p> <p>He broke off the kiss long enough to whisper in her ear, "Don't be afraid." A little more than a dozen little tugs at her shoulder as the kiss ended, and she saw him turn, moving the crotch of his jeans around to the side to look at what happened.</p> <p>He got her panties off, and her legs quickly slid apart. He took them off completely, and then slid one hand behind her knee, pulling her body backward on the chair so he could pull her pussy down to his mouth. Her lips parted as he slid a finger up and down her pussy, her clit, and the moisture that was there already. A shudder passed through her as he flicked at it.</p> <p>He slid back, taking his tongue with him, and then he moved to the other nipple. He moved quickly, sucking them with no pause, and then took both into his mouth.</p> <p>Her hands were on his hair, she was lost in it, and he knew what she wanted. He lifted his mouth, and she could taste her own juices as he sucked. He wanted to lick her pussy all over, and she was ready, so he sucked both nipples into his mouth, and then he started to move his lips down her body, kissing slowly, but firmly, all the way.</p> <p>As he moved downward so he could bite on her panties, he slid her panties off, and she felt the heat of his face as he kissed her pussy. All she knew, every emotion she knew, was that her pussy was being manhandled by a man who really cared about her. All it could really do was make her wet.</p> <p>Then a little more pressure on her clit, and a moment later, she felt his tongue lick the area between the lips of her pussy, and she knew she wasn't going to last very long. She knew she was about to come, and she wanted his mouth on her, on her pussy the way she wanted him. She loved having him between her legs, the way he could please her, and she loved having a tongue in her, licking the inside of her pussy as she came.</p> <p>She could feel every muscle in her pussy tense up as the pleasure started to build. She could feel herself start to open up, and then the wave hit, like a thunderbolt inside her pussy. She could feel her thighs shaking, and her ass tightening up; and then she felt her pussy clamp up in spasms. It was not pain, but it was intense pleasure as she came, and it didn't cause her to feel any pain in the way the man before her took on the role of manâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
