I think we're going to stay home."</p> <p>"Well, it's good to see your mom, so go on in."</p> <p>"Ah, yeah...and don't you dare go there until you are at home?"</p> <p>"Mmmm-hmmm," he said and left her room, walking to his car and parking in the garage.</p> <p>He didn't get home so fast or so much that he didn't have time until the alarm was set. So he walked up to her bedroom and pulled on some shorts and a t-shirt before he opened the door and stepped out. But when he did hear her car pull into his driveway, he heard voices from inside before he felt the familiar rush of adrenaline that comes from meeting a man's sexual desires.</p> <p>"Where's your dad?" she said, standing in the middle of her living room, staring at him. "I've been wondering where you were."</p> <p>"Your dad was in the car. Sorry he's gone."</p> <p>"I'm not. But...we're not alone. Mom's in the kitchen. I just left my dad at home, and you don't have to go home. Go upstairs and change..."</p> <p>"Mmm-hmmmm," he said, knowing what she wanted and he was about to watch her as she stripped naked. Her panties were soaked through. So was he, if what she said and what he did was turning him on something fierce. He wanted that, no, needed that, but he tried not to show it.</p> <p>Mmmm...I can't wait till we get to our bed, or even the shower.</p> <p>He started to undress before her and she moved closer to the stairs.</p> <p>"Oh, look, my dad's here," she said, holding out her hand. "So I guess we get to go take care of each other after he goes home tonight."</p> <p>"You're not just saying that, are you?" he said, feeling like he had never said it before. She hadn't had sex with a stranger in quite some time, much less had sex with a stranger. But he felt lucky. It was what it was.</p> <p>She held her hand out for him, not sure what she was holding. "I'm so sorry. I didn't mean anything by what you said or what you saw. Do you want me to?" "Are you sure? Are you sure this is ok?" he asked nervously. He had to get her out of her panties before something bad got out of hand.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure. This is all my fault. I should have told you, but I'm not sure you should just go ahead and do it without asking first," she told him, holding his hands.</p> <p>They went upstairs, to her bedroom. She closed the door behind them, and turned on the light. She had one of the largest and most sensuous beds she had ever had the pleasure of getting into bed with. She felt it had been awhile since she had taken a break. She hadn't had sex in a long, long time, not that it mattered, she decided. She got out of her clothes and climbed into bed, lying back against the pillows and closing her eyes.</p> <p>His mother was taking off her clothes, one piece at a time, a black and red satin corset. She kept her eyes closed for a little while and then opened one eye to look at him. She was nervous.</p> <p>His mother had a look of nervousness on her face that seemed normal at first. The tension between them was clear now. It seemed like a long lifetime ago. She was never going to trust him again after this. The last thing that she wanted to deal with was her son.</p> <p>"I'm not your mother," she said, and he couldn't believe he had said it in the middle of another sentence. This was the first chance she had taken since they had been married to go to counseling again.</p> <p>"No. Are you sure, mom?" he replied. "I'm not sure I can do that, either," he added, taking his shorts off and climbing into his bed on top of hers.</p> <p>The next week was hell. The week went by quickly. In fact, their sex came to a point that they had both worked so many hours away from each other that it was like a dam has been broken. It wasn't just the sex they were having, it was also the loneliness, the separation from him. They wanted to be together in everything. They couldn't just go back to each other.
