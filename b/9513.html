I'd been right, he felt good, and when I was finished kissing him, he turned his face to mine and we hugged with a long kiss, our bodies against each other and our lips touching as our tongues danced and our lips sealed.</p> <p>I felt his cock harden against me, as it had been that night in the car, feeling the bulge against my thigh, the hardness and the texture that made him so excited. He pulled back and I sighed. "How does it feel to really be here with you?"</p> <p>"Oh," he said. "That was incredible."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Well, just you and me."</p> <p>"Is it okay if we fuck again?"</p> <p>"Yes." I nodded, and he looked into my eyes, and I closed them and we kissed again. He pulled away and looked at me. "It's my turn to fuck now?"</p> <p>I nodded and got on all fours. He looked at me, and then at my pussy, and I shook my head. He went to his belt and I saw him unfasten it and unbuckle it, and then his pants. He let them drop, his cock jutting out in front of him, but he didn't have any underwear on. He knelt down behind me and grabbed my ankles, pulling them up over his shoulders so he'd have the full length of his cock aimed into me.</p> <p>His cock was thick, just huge. He wasn't as big as Tim but he was pretty good, and so was he. He slid in easily to the hilt. I was wet and ready, and he was fucking me just fine. "Oh, God," I moaned.</p> <p>"That's right," he said. And then he kissed me. I leaned back, looking at him as he fucked me. My eyes were closed, and he kissed me. "Do you know what I mean?"</p> <p>"No," I said. I had no idea what to say.</p> <p>"Let's see," he said and he picked up speed, shoving deep into me and pulling back until I was sitting on my heels, his balls slapping my ass. I felt him come inside me and the feeling drove me wild, and I threw my head back to meet his strokes.</p> <p>"That's good," he said. "I don't know how long I can last again," he said.</p> <p>"That was fantastic," I said, "I love having your big cock in me."</p> <p>"Do you want," he said, "to be in me again sometime?"</p> <p>"More than anything in the world," I said.</p> <p>"I want you to be my lover. And I want to be in you until we're both done, and we fuck and do it some more, okay?"</p> <p>"I can't, not right now."</p> <p>"Just let me know when you're ready," he said. He pulled out, and I sat there as his come dripped down my back and onto the bed.</p> <p>"No," I said. He saw my eyes, and I saw a look of regret.</p> <p>"Don't go," he said.</p> <p>"I don't have to. I'll tell you laterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
