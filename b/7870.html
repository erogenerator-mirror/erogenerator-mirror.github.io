She asked.</p> <p>"Just do me a favor?" he asked.</p> <p>"Sure, anything."</p> <p>"Use my phone. We can both take pictures."</p> <p>"I guess that would make a little more sense though, wouldn't you?" He said.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Ok, just do me a favor, and we can get some shots taken together." He told her.</p> <p>"Ok, let's make a video of you in your bra." She said.</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>He went to his bedroom, got a digital camera, and took a picture he took while wearing a bra. He then took a photo of the bra hanging on him and on his body. She was still not wearing a skirt.</p> <p>"Wow, your tits look great!" He told her.</p> <p>"Thank you." She replied.</p> <p>He then took a few more pictures of her standing before him in her sexy pink bra and panties. As he snapped the photo, he let the camera continue to take it in his hand.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, you looked so sexy! I have never seen a woman in her underwear before." He said.</p> <p>"That's because I am new to this, but I am getting wet just from making myself look sexy. I want to be so sexy for you." She told him.</p> <p>"Are you sure you are ready for me to be your first?" He asked.</p> <p>"Hell yes I am."</p> <p>"Would you like me to call you up and let you know I am here? I am not going to let it happen again." He asked.</p> <p>"Maybe just make conversation, that would help." She replied.</p> <p>Honey looked at the clock on his desk, it was 7:00 PM.</p> <p>"Ok, I will call your mom. Maybe we can meet. Maybe we can get together sometime." He told her.</p> <p>Honey stood up and looked at him and said, "Alright, I can do that."</p> <p>"Great. See you around 8:10." He told her before going over to his bed.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" Her face was flushed. She was so turned on by all the sexual comments he had made. She was even more turned on than she was when she had left home a few days before!</p> <p>She pulled up her panties to her knees and looked down at the sight of her bare legs, and panties. Her mind kept going back to all of her orgasms. She had orgasms like that in her entire life! She could not believe that she had never had one before! She then stripped completely, and stepped into her panties.</p> <p>She pulled them up tight with a little difficulty as she was not as wet as she had been. She looked in the mirror and noticed something different. She then noticed a strange tattoo on her left butt cheek! She looked at herself in the mirror and could not see herself. She then remembered her tattoo at her hip, and how she had taken that image. It would not be a permanent reminder, but it would be her sign of how much she loved her husband. She looked closer, and saw what she was looking at. On her neck was a strange letter in the shape of a penis!</p> <p>Honey reached over and placed her hand on the tattoo which was about 30 inches long as it was on her upper arm. She gently pressed it back down.</p> <p>"Honey, that looks great. It feels good, no pain. It must be permanent." She told him.</p> <p>She then took and turned it again to see it more clearly. She then noticed it had the letters "P" written to it, and a number to the right that was written in an elegant lettering. Her mouth opened and closed to cover it more.</p> <p>"Honey, are you sure? I don't want to hurt you." He asked.</p> <p>"It's ok. It's not as bad as it was." She told him.</p> <p>"Well, your not upset at all are you?" He asked her.</p> <p>"No! We shouldn't be doing this." She told him.</p> <p>"Look, I can't tell you this, but I'm sure that you would like to find out what it is like to have it pierced through your body. Do you have any preference if it's okay?" He said.</p> <p>"Yes I guess." She told him.</p> <p>"Do we actually meet tomorrow? I promise I won't hurt you. We can even arrange for a friend to come over and help us. Please don't let us hurt you." He said.</p> <p>She gave him an odd look and told him that everything from there. She could hear her heart beat as she told him her last story.</p> <p>"You haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
