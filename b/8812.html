"So big! So big! Oh, God! So fucking big! Oh!"</p> <p>I put her legs onto my shoulders and lowered myself into her. Every muscle in her body seemed to flex and relax as she rode me. After a minute, she looked over at me in awe. Her arms had lost their grip around the back of the sofa, and she was shaking with exertion. Her body was covered in sweat, and the sight of that caused me to shudder and tremble with excitement. I felt a warm sensation in my balls and I knew I was about to shoot. I closed my eyes, tilted my head back, and moaned. I felt the warm, viscous fluid fill my wife. I had barely gotten off, but I could hardly wait for her next orgasm.</p> <p>She rode out her orgasm in a few seconds, and then slowed. Her pussy was covered in my cum and her legs were limp. She turned her attention to kissing me and licking my face. By this time, we were both a wreck from our exertions. She stood up and kissed me again. I felt the blood filling my dick under her. We broke our kiss and then stared at each other, looking at the ceiling. We could have looked at each other for hours if she'd have let it happen, but she broke the stare first.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" she said, still on shaky legs. "That had to feel so damn good!"</p> <p>"I'm not done!" I told her, laughing.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she said again. "It feels wonderful but it sure doesn't taste any better. But let's do it again, okay?"</p> <p>We kissed again, and I kissed my way back to her face and neck, all the way down, kissing and licking, and nibbling all over her body. I was hard again, pushing up into her, but she stopped me. I pushed up back into her, and she took my face in her hands and began sucking on me again while I pumped her. My cock ached, but I could barely move. I pushed up into her, and felt the warmth. Her nipples were hard as rock, and I could feel that their blood was beating fast. The heat of her body and the sucking of her tongue seemed to draw me into even greater passion. I leaned into her, and my weight forced my face into her and I felt my dick thrust up into her again and again. Her hips moved, and she groaned loudly.</p> <p>We continued at this for a half hour or so, until she stopped again. We looked at each other, and then she got down and knelt between my legs, pulling them back towards her. I looked down at my prick, which was a bit red and inflamed. It seemed like an inch had stuck out of the foreskin. She stroked my cock for a bit and seemed to find it again. The thought made me feel as though an erotic dream come true. She got me wet with her spit. She stroked a second time, then got me very wet, and continued doing things that made me feel good. I was moaning very loudly, and it felt as though I was having a seizure.</p> <p>When I felt a hand on my hip, I pushed myself back up into her, and saw it was one of her friends -- someone she'd never told me she knew. She rubbed me a bit and then stood up, sliding her cock all the way inside me. As she started moving and making love in a gentle, yet intense way, her eyes were closed and she was breathing heavily. I thought I could hear her heart beating and that she was breathing fast too. I put one of my hands over her mouth and the other over hers. We came together. Her hips rose up, and I felt her legs lock around me. I pulled her hips down and pushed in deeply. I looked down again and saw a drop of cum begin to form on the shaft and begin to drip off, and slide down her, and I heard her inhale sharply through clenched teeth.</p> <p>We fucked all throughout our whole body, sometimes standing up, then walking around to the side. We would bend over a little, holding hands and occasionally lifting her legs up over my shoulders. We both kept making love with her until I thought I could take no more. When I felt cum begin to run down my dick, I put her legs down and let her come down. My legs were trembling as I bent over again and took her in my arms. I laid beside her and we rolled to our sides.</p> <p>"Jesus," she said, "That was ... wow."</p> <p>"Glad you enjoyed it," I said, smiling.</p> <p>"Can we do it again?" she asked, not really caring.</p> <p>"Sure," I said, "I'd love that to be the last timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
