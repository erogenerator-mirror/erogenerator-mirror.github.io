Go easy on me, you dirty old man," she replied with a dirty smile. She pulled herself back up to the table. Then she reached for a napkin.</p> <p>"Just a bit of this before I go," she said, handing me her napkin.</p> <p>She took it and wiped herself with a napkin and then took my hand and walked me to the car. "We have to get out of here."</p> <p>She held the passenger door for me, and smiled as I stood behind her. She slid in. "You're right," she said. "They are going to try and make the most of it."</p> <p>"I hope you're right," I said.</p> <p>"You still have some questions."</p> <p>"Please," I said. I pulled out and drove out of the restaurant.</p> <p>I drove to the park and found a nice clearing. When the light changed to green I turned on my light and pulled out. I turned on the radio and checked some of my CD's. I looked at the screen and saw that the group of dancers had finished up and were dancing together. One of the dancers had one of their boots on, and was putting her fingers in her ear, and was singing along to that as she did it. It was interesting but not very erotic.</p> <p>I was still thinking about this when one of the dancers came over and asked if I was going back to the hotel room. I told her I was and headed back to the hotel. I didn't realize that it was going to lead to that. It was going to be another hour or two before the lights changed back to green. I guess I just went into the movie part of the story because then there would be a few things going on in the movie. The sex scenes would get a little graphic and a bit less erotic after the action-filled part, because it would have been far too long. I did manage to get an orgasm out of this though, because my cock stayed hard the whole time I was driving.</p> <p>I got home and got ready for my shower. I thought about the conversation from earlier. "Well, how do I take care of that thing?" I thought. But I also thought about how far this was going to go. "Can I do the cleaning on the way and stay in here long? That's not going to hurt," I had to think of some way to be able to take care of it myself. While it was working, I wasn't so sure I could pull this off.</p> <p>I didn't think it was that far. I wanted to use my powers to finish my shower. It might be like a power exchange between an erotic and a power exchange between a strong sexual relationship. I still wasn't sure where I wanted to put my hands. I wanted to be able to take care of myself, and I couldn't do that by force or force alone. I had some ideas, I just had to do what I thought was right. I also didn't want the opportunity for the first time to feel something I didn't want to feel. I decided to wait until the night before I got the chance to do this. I had to get it out of my system. I'd be in a relationship for a while, and it wasn't going to be a quick one.</p> <p>A little after one o'clock, I got the door opened. I was just finishing drying my hair when the door opened. I turned the shower off and stepped out, still completely naked. I looked over my shoulder. "Hi, I'm back to showering," I said.</p> <p>"Don't do anything for me," she said. "I'm glad to see you've decided to let me know by your end. I'd hate to have to turn you over my knee or something."</p> <p>"There's no need to do that."</p> <p>"No. You can do what you think is right with who you are."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not going to be an authority on that," I said. "If this is going to make me feel better, I would better put a clean pair of panties on myself."</p> <p>"Yes, you are very fair of heart," she said. "So you're not wearing them or anything else?"</p> <p>"No. Why do you ask?"</p> <p>"Well, it's very strange that after the shower, I haven't felt so much pain as before."</p> <p>"It certainly looks that way. I guess you're feeling a lot better now that we're in the tub."</p> <p>"Yes, I am very happy to see you," she said.</p> <p>She led me to the shower and had me step in first. "Do you mind if we clean each other first?" she asked, moving close enough to soap me.
