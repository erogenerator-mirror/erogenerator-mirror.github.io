The waiter left and returned with the check and I paid.</p> <p>“Would you care to order?”</p> <p>“Yes please, Maam,” I replied as we moved to our table.</p> <p>When we left the restaurant, my heart sunk into my stomach.</p> <p>“What happened?”</p> <p>“Please, Maam, I am sorry sir.”</p> <p>“Please, Callie, let me explain, please.”</p> <p>I stood up and started toward his table.</p> <p>“Would you like that, Maam?”</p> <p>I walked to him and he looked into my soft blue eyes. “Yes, it would be nice.” I walked to the center of the dining room and sat between his legs, I was afraid he could see every detail of my body through the dress. I was wearing a thin, white silk, blouse that buttoned down at the front. It was made to lift my breasts while we would be covered by thin layers of thin fabric that held our breasts in place when we had breasts. A black silk skirt was slit on the left side of my thighs.</p> <p>I could feel his gaze on me as we started to eat. I looked over his shoulder at my menu and then back at him.</p> <p>“Thank you.” I whispered to him.</p> <p>We talked about the menu for awhile, I liked it because I could just read his mind. We finished our dinner, he told me he didn't want to leave. I told him he could go, but I would go back to my office to wait. We talked for a long time about the story of the restaurant and I let him down easy. I felt the warmth coming from his body against mine.</p> <p>We walked back to his car and I sat back down on the driver’s seat and I reached over across to gently caress his cheek.</p> <p>“You made the reservation on the desk today.”</p> <p>He turned to me and smiled. “No harm, Maam.”</p> <p>“Thank you.”</p> <p>“Don’t thank me Maam...” I put my finger to his lips. “Thank you for being there too...”</p> <p>I stood up from the seat and leaned forward to him, my breasts were still bare and my nipples had hardened in the cool atmosphere. I placed my hands on his shoulders and pressed him to me. Our lips met with a soft and tender love between us. We kissed each other softly for eternity until we turned the engine off and got out of the parking lot and walked to his apartment.</p> <p>When we got inside, we sat and talked more until I had to go for the restroom and then went to the door of the bathroom. He followed me.</p> <p>“That’s a sexy outfit you have on.”</p> <p>He smiled back at me.</p> <p>I stepped into the bedroom and turned on his shower. I stepped into the shower and he stepped in behind me. I reached down and gently felt his hardness through my cloths.</p> <p>“I would much rather have you than me.” I smiled as I turned the water off and he took my hand and led me to the bed, I looked at him.</p> <p>“I have you to thank for all those years of being good to me.”</p> <p>“Thank you.”</p> <p>“I’m glad.”</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed me softly on my lips. His tongue danced over mine, he slid one of his hands under my shirt to find my bare breasts. He rolled my nipples between his fingers as we continued our embrace. As his tongue continued to dance over mine, his other hand lifted the bottom of my top, he began pulling down my bra as his lips explored my neck. I moaned as I felt the material of my bra catch in the water. He slipped a hand inside my blouse, found a breast and caressed it. He kissed my neck then nibbled on my collar bone as I leaned against him. I slid my hands down his back and his hand took the top of the blouse and deftly removed it to expose my breasts—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
