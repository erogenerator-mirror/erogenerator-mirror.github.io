I'm going to do a lot of work down there, and I want you to have fun tonight to remember."</p> <p>"Yeah, go on, whatever you say."</p> <p>"Ok. I'll hang on, but it's going to take some time. I want you to get a big glass of water in to get me to the top. Then I want you to get on your knees so that all of the guys can check out and cum on your hands. Then I want you to put that thing in your mouth and suck cock and cums. Then you have twenty more times to try to get me to the bottom. You'll be happy to say that because I'm going to be cumming by the end of your tryst. Then we'll meet downstairs. Then you can clean up and make love again, so long as I'm satisfied."</p> <p>"Ok," she replied as she stood up and stood around in front of him and took his hands to put them to her front, "I can't wait to see what I can do for you."</p> <p>Mark's hands were trembling a little, he'd gone from being scared to being excited all at once. But when he saw those hands moving under the table, he realized he'd been holding them lightly, like they'd be ticklish. He knew he'd never actually touch them, and yet they felt so good pressing down against him. It felt like one of her hands was cupping his ass. Then he saw it, one of the guys at the other table, a man that was leaning forward on one arm and was playing with a cock. His dick was pretty big, but it felt so soft and warm to him. And his hand was going up and down on it, jerking up and down over the end, while he talked and flicked at her tits. As he kept up that stroking, she smiled with a lusty smile and ran her hand down his chest, feeling the outline of his dick in his pants.</p> <p>They talked about it all day, about the various ways they would have sex for her. And when they had finished, they went back, so that the rest of the group could continue the conversation, with both women enjoying the show. During the lunch break, the other guy had finished his beer, and his erection had subsided. Mark was very turned on by the whole thing. This was no longer the guy he'd been with, this was a woman who was a part of this club. He wanted, but at the same time didn't want to fuck her. He felt a little guilty, he didn't want to get caught, but there she was - standing there, all naked, standing in front of him. He wondered if he should just go up and leave right then, but then his thoughts left, and he was too embarrassed to do anything.</p> <p>When they went to the table to sit down, they were seated sideways so that both of them were facing the middle table. They had the table set so most of the guys were watching the show, with only the other women sitting over the other side. The whole group got quiet and waited for the first to show up. Mark didn't really care if they showed up. He'd had his dick stroked before, when his dick was hard, but this was different. He knew that it was going to hurt, but he didn't care. He was really excited, but also kind of hurt that he could never do anything with Rachel - but he could certainly play with her. So he knew that maybe all he had to do was wait. That was the whole point of the plan. But if they showed up, Mark wasn't sure he'd be able to keep it from happening. And he was sure he hated the idea of cheating on his wife, but he didn't care.</p> <p>The one man sitting beside Rachel, that was sitting at her right, was about twenty at the same time, when they got up the nerve to come in. He was about six foot tall, and had a long thin build, about the same height as the other man across the table. They were both good looking, and Mark was pleased to find that they didn't have any trouble getting a drink for them from time to time, like everyone else. Mark was surprised at how many guys were having fun with the woman before him right in front of them. But then he thought to himself - 'Oh, my God, this is going to be great!'</p> <p>The man sitting next to the other man, who was a man about thirty years older than them, stood up right next to Rachel, and she waved him in to join them. Mark, who was about 6'5", was about half his weight, but looked as good as any one there in Mark's opinion, just sitting there in his blue jeans and a big white vest. He looked great in the vest, especially becauseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
