I had to touch her, to have her come out of her daydream. I had to hold her and kiss her and kiss her with desire so intense I nearly felt like I might explode with need. I felt like I could do things to her that I thought I couldn't do, and she knew exactly what she needed. Her fingers and hands were on me, stroking me, playing with me and making love to me. I felt her body shift as her fingers caressed and stroked the underside of my dick, her body shuddering against me at almost every touch.</p> <p>My body was on the verge of exploding...and I wanted all of me when she did it to me. But I just closed my eyes and let the orgasm overtake me before I even realized it. It was the best feeling that I had ever had even though it had been hard and painful, but it was not like I had with my father. I was lost in my own world, in the universe of lust and pleasure. My orgasm was long and violent, making me want to cry and sob while her fingers worked over my shaft. I looked down at her, trying to take in as much of this as I could, wanting to make her crazy.</p> <p>Finally I came down and let her feel me in her embrace. My body went still, feeling my orgasm ebbing. I could only watch her, amazed at what an incredible woman she was. She sat on her bed, her legs and arms spread wide, looking at me and stroking my hair. I had never seen a woman look so beautiful.</p> <p>"I've never taken that way before."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"You don't have a penis, just an average penis. I had never even heard of a penis. I'm afraid it's too big to come on a woman."</p> <p>"Can you please just touch me? I'm just not sure the way you touch me is appropriate. It felt so good, and I was surprised that it wasn't going to explode off of you."</p> <p>"It's not. That was nice."</p> <p>She seemed to be looking deeply into my eyes, waiting for something. After a moment I leaned down to give her a kiss, and she leaned in for one. I was stunned and shocked again. My lips, my kisses, my tongue, my cock, my hands...it was all of her in one moment.</p> <p>It was an incredible moment, and just the sensation of everything happening to me was overwhelming. I wanted more, wanted to be the one to come inside of her, but I could not find the words. I just leaned back and watched her face as my mind and body felt what she was putting me through, and I had never felt anything like it. I had never felt anything like she was feeling, or even touching me! I was stunned and confused and aroused by everything. Then I saw her, sitting on her bed, looking at me smiling like a cat, and I smiled back, feeling so happy. Then I saw her eyes widen a bit, and I saw the confusion and the arousal in her eyes as well. Her hands went from my arms to my shoulders, and then she moved her hands to the side of my face and back up and over to my neck.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"You know, you're still hard. You looked so hot, and I felt so turned on. It was so fucking hot, so fucking hot," she giggled.</p> <p>"Is that what you're talking about? Are you saying that you'll fuck me if I just let you come inside of my hot little cunt?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"What?" She stopped in mid-sentence, her eyes never leaving me.</p> <p>"I was just wondering," I said, not wanting to spoil any of the fun. "Would you want more than just a little pleasure?"</p> <p>She gave me that devilish little smile again, and then started to walk over to her bed once again. "You're not going to tell me you're not ready yet. It will take time, but the pleasure will be so worth it. And after that, you can't imagine what the next year is going to be," she told me, looking at me as if I had just come straight out of the water. "I'm so wet and horny. How could I possibly resist this?"</p> <p>She looked down at herself, taking in my throbbing member, and then over at me. "I am so wet right now, I can hardly stand it, and we both need to get off. Can you please turn over for me?"</p> <p>She was looking at me from head to toe, the look on her face was so sexy she must have been turned onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
