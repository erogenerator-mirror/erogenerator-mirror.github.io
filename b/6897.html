The words came out breathy and thick.</p> <p>"You want it?" he asked, his tone light and casual while he used the word "fuck." He wasn't sure why he had chosen this moment. Her pussy squeezed his cock hard, milking and squeezing his cock as her hips grinded up and down, sending waves of pleasure up and down his shaft.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she repeated. "Fuck me hard. God I need your cock in my pussy," she said softly, her hips moving up a little and back down quickly, her body taut, her skin warm and taut. "I'm yours," she added. "Take me," she said, almost pleadingly.</p> <p>He moved his hand, palm towards his thigh, to find her swollen lips puffy, her clitoris engorged, and wet with her juices. Her hand moved over his and he used his other hand to place it on her thigh, his fingers coming to rest on the inside of her leg. He knew that she wore no panties. He pulled the cotton of her panties to the side and slid his cock inside of her hot tightness. He was amazed to not only feel the intense heat of her as he slid his dick deeper between her lips, but also to feel the warmth of her as her legs wrapped themselves around him, her heels digging into his ass, her thighs tightening, squeezing him tightly and sending waves of pleasure straight to his groin and up to his brain. "Oh God," she murmured, her body rocking with the motion of his, her back arched and her head thrashing from side to side, her hair swirling over the place where her mouth met his. She was breathing hard, her chest heaving and her hair tousled from her exertions; he felt each part of her body. He moved his hips faster. He could see that every time he went back and forth, she'd be lifting her hips and meeting his penetration with one of her own. She'd tighten around him even more, and when he was in her as deep as she was, the movement of her body would push her body into the mattress, against that of his and as he withdrew, her body would tighten and squeeze tighter. He could feel himself building. He moved faster and faster. He felt a light, sudden pressure in his groin that almost made him come. He could feel himself swell, the blood rush rushing in, the tingling of his own release as his cock spasmed and throbbed and his body spasmed, and he was gasping and groaning and panting. And then his body started to spasm and jerk and it began again, his release wave after wave of cum shooting from his cock.</p> <p>"David," she said softly. "Do you always get like that?"</p> <p>"Every time," he chuckled.</p> <p>"You like it?" she asked. "Does it make you come more?"</p> <p>"I... yes," he grunted.</p> <p>"Do you always cum harder than that?"</p> <p>"Sometimes," he answered.</p> <p>Sarah smiled to herself. She was enjoying his performance. She loved the thought of him coming with her. She loved the feel of another man's spunk pumping into her pussy—so warm and filling and so different in every sense, so different from the feel of his cock as it slid in her flesh, the taste of him inside her, and the way that their juices mingled and slid together in an orgasmic wave of ecstasy as he continued to pump his dick deep inside of her, filling her, filling her. She had never come like that before, never had the desire to come like that before, never had the desire to come again and again in that moment.</p> <p>"I'm glad you asked me something," she whispered into his ear as they lay on their sides. "I needed to feel your cock in me again."</p> <p>"You mean, like now?" "Yeah," she said. I mean, I've probably never felt the same after sex. I loved it when your cock slid in. And, of course, I love having it in me." Her tongue touched the side of his ear as she spoke. "Don't worry," she said with a mischievous smile. "At first it was kind of weird. But as we got used to it, and our bodies got used to it, the real pleasure started to come in me. You make me feel horny."</p> <p>"It's not strange," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"Not really. I'm just glad it happened so quickly," she replied.</p> <p>"It did," he said, giving her a little smile, the smile of a person who really knows what he wants.</p> <p>"So are you happy," she asked—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
