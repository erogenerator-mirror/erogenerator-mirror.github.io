"It will be so nice for you too. We both want to share it."</p> <p>"I will take your word," he said, as his eyes looked deeply into them. She smiled again. "Are we agreed?"</p> <p>No one needed to ask what they were agreeing to.</p> <p>"I am very sure," she told him. "I can smell my pussy getting wetter by the second. You are going to love everything about my cunt."</p> <p>It could not have been the only thought that raced through his head. This gorgeous creature was also completely naked, yet they were all under one blanket of luxury; nothing could hurt the mood of being surrounded by such wildness and beauty. He felt as if he were in the presence of an entirely new experience, and he was not going to be able to find that experience in a lifetime.</p> <p>"I want to feel it being touched intimately," she promised him, and he nodded in consent.</p> <p>A moment later, he felt his hard cock brush through the wet, tight, cleft of her cunt.</p> <p>"Ohhhh my god, that feels so good! Oh, don't stop. You're making me come! Oh, please. Don't ever stop!"</p> <p>It was not long before she too could not hold off a moment longer. She grabbed his head between her legs with both hands and pulled it closer to her cunt. He watched her, mesmerized by the image of his cock's huge member plunging into her body. She moaned and threw her head back.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, fuck me. Deeper! Harder! Oh, Oh, OHHHHH!" she cried as she climaxed for the second time in a very short time.</p> <p>After her release, she climbed off him and gave him a passionate kiss.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The next morning John felt refreshed in his surroundings. The smell of food and fresh fruits, and the taste of butter on his lips were the very last remnants of his previous encounter. A smile came on his face at the sight he had just experienced.</p> <p>"Are you okay there? Your hand is still shaking."</p> <p>Dolly was still sitting in his arms. He was still in his sleep. She had a contented expression on this face, and he felt as if the world had stopped spinning. A smile appeared upon her lips too. They were tired, but still alive.</p> <p>"Why are you still here?" His question was answered by a smile. "I'm tired too!"</p> <p>"You are?" he asked her.</p> <p>"I'm hungry! You can bring me over some more," she offered him.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" he said as he got up.</p> <p>"Here?" she responded.</p> <p>"Yeah," he called back.</p> <p>"I need to go for a walk."</p> <p>Dolly led him by the hand, and they walked across the lawn to a large area of trees, and she sat beside him. He was looking out towards the sea.</p> <p>"Why do you want to stay here?" She wanted him to ask her, as if he was some sort of animal wanting to know something that she never would tell him.</p> <p>He looked back for a moments. "I just don't think that I can go back to that place," he said.</p> <p>"I am sorry," she offered.</p> <p>"I understand. I also understand if you need someone to stay with you, but I can't," he smiled at her.</p> <p>"This is what you want?" she said, and gave him a sly smile back.</p> <p>"Yes, but I want more of the same thing," he agreed. "I have to see this place again."</p> <p>"Yes it was nice," she said. "Why would you want us to stay here, John?"</p> <p></p> <p>"It was nice enough," he admitted. "But more than that, I want more of you. My parents had their problems," he looked into her eyes, and they both smiled.</p> <p>"I see. So why did you want to come now?" she asked curiously.</p> <p>"They are expecting me. I can just go as I am. I am free to do as I please there," he told her. A smile was on her face, and she understood now just how serious he was on this.</p> <p>"You can do that?" she was surprised, but she just gave him the same look she always gave him.</p> <p>They both got up and walked towards a bench.</p> <p>"This bench needs your attention, if you know what I mean."</p> <p>"Sure, I know," she replied.</p> <p>At the bench, there was enough room to sitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
