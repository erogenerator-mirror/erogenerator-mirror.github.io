Jodi asked.</p> <p>"Do you want to go down for a drink? You have been working out for a long time."</p> <p>I laughed and said, "You are the best here!"</p> <p>She looked down shyly and said, "Yes. I have been working out for a long time."</p> <p>"I have heard that you did some boxing, some biking and a bike training."</p> <p>Jodi stood up and looked up at me.</p> <p>"You have got muscles under your arms. I did a couple things on the trip over and saw that there is a good gym here. I have had a trainer on my back. I like that in a woman.</p> <p>I smiled at Jodi, "That is nice. Did you train in the Army."</p> <p>She giggled a little and said, "No. I did do some training, but a few of the guys got me into a fight. The instructor tried to help out."</p> <p>"What fight?" I said.</p> <p>"Well, one of the guys came too easy for me and I got some kicks from him. He was hitting me." She said, laughing softly.</p> <p>"Well, what is it with me and boxing?" I said.</p> <p>"Well, to be fair, we are both pretty flexible and we spar a lot."</p> <p>I was surprised.</p> <p>I did not expect the girl to have a lot of trouble with that.</p> <p>She sat down at the kitchen table; crossed her long legs, lifted them onto her foot, and sat back down.</p> <p>"I never thought that you would be coming here. Your friends probably wouldn't recognize you."</p> <p>"Just my friends. They think my hair is dirty, some gray or something. I don't pay much attention to them anyway. I just follow when I can."</p> <p>The thought of my friends seeing me naked for the first time in a few weeks was a big deal. I was a little surprised, but she was right. The only thing I had to pay attention to was my friends.</p> <p>"I need to go put some sweat pants on. Do you mind joining?" she said.</p> <p>"Sure. What about coffee?" I said, with a smile.</p> <p>I went into the little kitchen and started to put my sweat pants on. Jodi was putting hers on when I came out from the kitchen. She had changed since she had been in her workout gear. It was still sexy black leather and she was in her workout clothes. She was wearing a skirt that was about four inches above the knee, and she was wearing a white blouse that was sleeveless. It also tied with a belt and she had on sandals that I had her wearing today! I had to help her put hers on.</p> <p>"I wanted a change of clothes today. I thought I might go to a gym or something." She giggled a little when I asked to change clothes. She had gone to the house in her workout clothes again. She said she liked what she saw at a gym. She would be in the gym by the next day if she got some exercise.</p> <p>We ate lunch in the kitchen, had some more coffee and then went back to the house. We went upstairs to the room I had to change in and changed to our workout clothes. I was still a little surprised by what had happened, but, you get use to it.</p> <p>We had a good workout. When we were through, we started another one. Then we went out to the living room, changed, etc. and sat around the coffee table. She had a bottle of water ready to go so I knew we had a chance to talk about anything, from our time together to our future.</p> <p>I looked into her eyes again; she smiled.</p> <p>"So, are you coming down for that boxing match tonight?" I said.</p> <p>I knew that wasn't a good idea. I could tell that she knew. It was getting dark now. She was a little nervous about it.</p> <p>"No, I'm not coming down."</p> <p>She looked at me and smiled again. "Can you come to the match?"</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>After that, there was no more talking. We were both relaxed and happy. She told me that she had had some training, but she was still doing some things and her workout training was hard, but she got into it. She had gone to the gym about once a month and was now working out.</p> <p>In a few short weeks we had been going to the gym regularly. We had finished our workout at the gym and were out by our pool. She told me that the club used to have a gymâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
