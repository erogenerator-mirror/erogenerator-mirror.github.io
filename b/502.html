The feel of the fabric against her pussy and her nipples on the sheets aroused me more than I had ever done before.</p> <p>And here I lay... on my front. On the bed! God it was so beautiful! Her tits hanging there invitingly, the nipples pointing out, her lovely nipples. I wanted more than simply exploring and exploring their beauty. It was so hard to restrain myself. It was hard to just... just... just not try to enter or thrust into her. It was just too difficult to just... not just do to her what she liked. I had to. But I couldn't! The truth... it couldn't... I would just have to give my head and my heart and my mind a chance. I had to!</p> <p>No sooner had I thought this than the sound of the door close and the door open, then I heard it and the door was closed as well.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Chapter 3:</p> <p>I can't tell you how long I lay there. I don't know how long all of the time my thoughts ran together; but it was too difficult to try to explain. I just... well, sort of lie there.</p> <p>I lay there and just... sort of lie there. In my sleep, all I could think about was the feel of her tits, the feel of her nipples on my neck and all that sort of... stuff. She must... all I could do... was to lie there. I felt warm breath on my neck and... nothing! I don't know how it happened; but suddenly I heard the door. The footsteps went over the bed and she was there!</p> <p>I almost burst into tears! I know it was her but that was... she's... she's my wife. Yes, she is! I couldn't possibly move! I just... there... just held myself... still!</p> <p>...</p> <p>Chapter 4:</p> <p>"Why are you doing this?" she whispered to me, with tears in her eyes.</p> <p>All I could do was move my arms around her body. I felt her so... so... soft. I was just so...</p> <p>I just held her... there... and it... it felt as if my heart would burst. But, the reality was that I couldn't have. And it wasn't just the fear of the moment that I felt. It was because her arms were so soft and yet... they were so much like a normal female's. And I felt her hands on my arms and I could feel her nails gently on my bare skin. I could feel my heart hammering and the desire in me rising.</p> <p>"What do you want?" I asked her, still holding her.</p> <p>She didn't answer me but, with tears in her eyes, she just hugged me tightly. It was all so wrong. Why could I have done something, even what I was thinking, such as this, but I was sure her husband or even her brother or even even her grand-mother had enjoyed this more than she had. She was right, of course, it was too much to say. I really had to do something!</p> <p>"Honey," I said to her, softly, but firmly, "I want and I want to make it right. All right?"</p> <p>That I can do if... if you don't want to try again, is that what you are asking me to do... to try and make her realise the reality of it? Because I sure as hell don't want to, but I'd really love to... to be in that position again, so to speak. What more would it take? What more could she ask me to do?</p> <p>"I will just have to take you shopping one day when you're still married, maybe when they start leaving. Yes?"</p> <p>That sounded... it sounded as if her husband and her sister had been very bad and the fact that they had not had any contact with each other was a miracle. But, I was wrong in thinking she would have liked that idea. She was so beautiful and it seemed so right to me. And... she has been my friend!</p> <p>I didn't know what to say.</p> <p>I guess I didn't really need to ask her to go to a mall or anything. So she wasn't going to go, nor would she go to her aunt or anyone from the town... that was all that mattered. But that wasn't it at all. It was what I was asking. I wanted... I wanted to, to try and make things right.</p> <p>No... she would just have to go with me. But...</p> <p>"You seem like a nice enough man to have a nice home. What did you fancy doing while I'm gone?" she asked me sweetly.
