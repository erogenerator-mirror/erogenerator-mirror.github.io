"How does it feel?"</p> <p>He kissed her head. "It's not exactly comfortable. That's why I'm doing this. I'm not sure how well it'll help."</p> <p>She giggled. "I can't believe it's actually going to work. You're amazing, and I'm surprised that I'm even still here. "</p> <p>Her face still flushed slightly, he got an idea. "I know there are some places it can't be comfortable. But let's check." He grabbed her and lifted her up, spinning slowly once more, the whole way around. He placed her ass on a small table and knelt down.</p> <p>"Now, that's more comfortable. And no-one gets in with my dick. I'll just keep it as I always use it. Just relax while I check."</p> <p>She nodded and spread herself out, the whole of her body glistening with sweat now as she got more relaxed.</p> <p>It took only a second or two before his hard dick popped into her, pushing her back the second his thighs pressed into her chest. The feeling of his hot skin against hers was all it took. He thrust once more and pulled back, before pushing it in again. The sensation of his dick stretching her and feeling her lips slide back against it only seemed to heighten her pleasure a bit. She moaned under him and felt his muscles clench.</p> <p>"Mmmm... feels as if you'll be coming to," he rasped.</p> <p>"Yes. Just sit there and enjoy. I know you're so tense, but it's not over yet. "</p> <p>She nodded. He slid his dick from her ass to her clit. "Gently," he said, pulling back slightly and thrusting again, the feeling of her fingers squeezing her nipples driving her crazy.</p> <p>With a moan, she came, her juices streaming down her thighs as a wave of pleasure washed through her entire body.</p> <p>For a second he sat there, trying to catch his breath. Her body was quivering slightly and the only sound, coming from the slight gasp of her head on her forehead, was the sound of her pussy getting filled even more than it was. When it was done, he pulled his dick out of her and sat up. He reached back and pulled her legs up, spreading her ass wide enough to take his dick. As he pressed it back in, he moved his right hand to the little table where a bottle of lube was still on top, but now he had a better view.</p> <p>"I'm going back," he said. "I'll be right back." He took off running bare-handed toward the door and she felt him grab the door handle. "What's your name?" he asked as the metal door opened and he came back, grinning ear to ear.</p> <p>"My lover," she replied, feeling herself blush even more.</p> <p>He laughed. "Just call me 'Mr.' I like that." He gave her ass a playful smack and left her there, watching as she turned around and slid off one of the couch chairs, getting down on her hands and knees.</p> <p>"I thought it was okay for you to sit there," he said while leaning against a nearby door frame. "If I were back there, I couldn't walk like this."</p> <p>"Uh-huh?" she replied playfully. "Maybe just the one on your hip. I think some other people can do better too."</p> <p>"You're not helping. It'll be easier to go to a club." The room was suddenly very quiet, as though there was some light still glowing, but not enough to notice. He was right, of course. If he was out there, he would have gone. But he had to wait for the other women to arrive. The thought made him feel sick.</p> <p>She looked at the door, her mouth feeling like it was going to hang open. They still hadn't heard the door open.</p> <p>He gave her ass a playful smack and got up, watching her intently from where he stood next to the door. He leaned back on the floor, watching her ass sway between her hands. He was enjoying himself almost as much as she was. He had only just come, but already his dick was straining against the fabric of his pants. He took a couple steps toward her, letting the chair down as he walked. She looked up, looking toward the door as he got closer.</p> <p>"How'd it go?" She asked, sitting with her hands on her lap.</p> <p>"I just wanted to find out if there was anything I could go to." There was a small awkward pause as she continued to hold her lap. "I've been a naughty girl," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
