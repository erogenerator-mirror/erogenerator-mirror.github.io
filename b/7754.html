I've been wanting you to say that for weeks." She was teasing as she lifted her finger and slowly pressed the tip of his cock between her wet lips, running it along the length of his shaft. "And when it comes, I'll make sure I get it."</p> <p>Sitting in the water, she looked at him, the water rolling down her face as she leaned down and kissed him. Her tongue slipped into his mouth and they kissed again.</p> <p>They swam for awhile and both of their swimsuits came off. Both were completely naked and, suddenly, they were kissing each other with full, hard deep kisses. Gave in and stood, looking down at his huge erection as she took his cock and turned it to face her. "You've got a great cock." She said to him, giving it a little squeeze, "I love sucking your cock."</p> <p>He grinned and smiled, "And I have a better one you've got there. It's nice." They kissed some more and then lay down on the wet towels that covered the towels and they cuddled. They fell asleep almost in each other's arms.</p> <p>Morning came and, as it did every morning, with it came the sight of the two naked lovers. At first, as they lay there, enjoying their morning post sex and their love making, Gave looked at Tracy with a slight frown. She lay back on her bed, closed her eyes and let her fingers slowly explore her vagina and clitoris and she smiled at the beautiful man lying beside her, gently caressing her, running her fingers through her pubic hair and running them up and down each of her thighs. She smiled when she saw that Bill was still as hard as ever and he started to run his fingers over his cock, slowly and gently, stroking it and feeling the lovely smoothness of his skin. When he started to rub his hips, she slid her tongue into his mouth for a slow kiss, sliding her hands along his sides until she found a firm, strong hard cock that he was stroking lightly, almost absentmindedly. She slid her mouth over it, sucking gently and licking its head, pulling it ever so gently into her mouth, sucking it gently and then sucking it again and again, her tongue and lips working expertly on it until she was ready to give him the same feeling, as she slipped her fingers up into her vagina and slowly worked them in and out.</p> <p>When her head moved towards his cock, she opened her eyes and looked at the beautiful dick before her, but she didn't move, didn't say anything, just closed her eyes and took it in her hand. Her heart was in her mouth and her mouth open and she gently rubbed her lips on the tip of his cock as she rubbed slowly on the shaft and she moaned, "Oh! Oh God! Oh I love that." Her mouth moved back to it and she slowly moved her lips over its head. With each movement in her mouth her head became more and more and then she opened her mouth a little and started to rub on it, pushing herself a little to each side of it as she did so, working her lips down the shaft and taking it down further, deeper into her mouth as her hand slipped up to cup his balls, squeezing them gently as his fingers played in her wet, hair. She moved her mouth slowly up, her tongue just touching the head of his cock as her lips pushed the shaft down a little and the head slipped over her tongue and out again, only a little deeper.</p> <p>Finally, with a mouth full of dick, her head moving all the way over and around his huge member, he put her on her stomach and she stretched herself out a little so that he could start to push his hard dick down her asshole. It didn't take much of her doing that to push him towards her. His hands quickly came back and were on her ass cheeks, pulling them apart and opening her. He pushed it slowly into her asshole, pulling her cheeks apart and feeling the way that her asshole was so warm and wet in there.</p> <p>As his prick slid into her, her breath came in short gasps so loud. She moaned and groaned and squirmed her ass onto his erection as it continued to push slowly in and out. It wasn't long before he felt his own climax come. His knees got a little weak and he collapsed on the bed beside her, panting and still stroking his cock. Gave her ass a big kiss and then turned her body to face him as he rolled over onto his back.</p> <p>She moved between his legs and moved slowly up and down his shaft. He held her there for a few moments and then slowly moved his hands down to her ass and spread her ass cheeks apart. She moved her ass slowly toward his hard cock and he lowered his hips to hers and kissed her slowly and passionately.
