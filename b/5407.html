You want to have me suck your big cock?" he asked, still looking at himself naked and aroused. His penis was thick and hard now. He moved to the side, away from where he sat, and she turned him towards her, leaning forward with her mouth open and a slight smile on her face. Her tongue was moving over his head, then sliding into the slit at the end as if she wanted to swallow him.</p> <p>"Oh... my God, I've never done that before", she said softly as she sucked him. "Wouldn't you like me to fuck you with my tongue?" she asked with a little laugh. "I mean, I've never done this! But I wanted to so much" she murmured excitedly.</p> <p>"I bet you do", he said. "I can't believe how good your mouth feels on me, little brother. I have to say, I like the way it feels wrapped around me. I think... no, seriously, I really should try it, but not here at the cabin." He grinned at her. "I'll walk you to the door if you want."</p> <p>The cab driver stopped and looked at his wife, then back at their erections. "I need a break, and it's awfully late to do anything. We aren't going anywhere now. I'll be back a long time, if you want me to." He glanced at his wife and grinned. She nodded her head.</p> <p>"Can we at least go home - before you leave?" he said, almost begging her. "I want to feel you against me for the whole trip, and then have you ride me for an hour as I drive back to the cabin." That brought a big grin on her face and a happy, relieved smile to her. She held his cock and squeezed it slowly before releasing him and sliding back against the seat with him, straddling his legs as he carried her to the front door and opened it. She slipped out before he could close the door, then leaned against it, smiling at him. "Thanks, honey! See you when you get back in town!" she said as he looked at her, holding him with one hand as he held the door open, and then walking around to the front side of the house, then through the front door, stopping to say, "Thank you!" and smiling as he looked back at her, smiling as he walked slowly down the stairs to join the other passengers.</p> <p>"You know, when they all turn around to leave for home, I might as well put on a show for them, too, so to speak. I can even do that with them, just when you're walking home. Sometimes I make myself cum, too. That's it, I really do that. We'll see how long they're gone."</p> <p>"That's nice," she replied. "I'm glad I could do the same for you, now. I'm always glad you came back. I'll see you in about the time you get back from the cabin". She gave him a long kiss and looked back at him. "You too, honey", she said. "We'll talk about what to do nextâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
