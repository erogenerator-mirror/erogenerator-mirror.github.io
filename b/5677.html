Her hands held my head in place as her legs grew weak and her body began to tremble, and she let it go without any protest. I pressed my tongue as deep as she had ever taken me before in her vagina and began to lap her like a dog, pushing her towards the edge, and then pulling back to keep her there. The vibrations of her moans were getting me close, and I pulled back hard, bringing her off just as I felt she was about to explode.</p> <p>"Oh... I'm... cummmminnnngggg!" she panted as her back arched and her fingers clamped my head in a vice as she came. It had the most violent climax I had ever had in my life and it was hard for me to hold back anymore. It just kept going all over me, pushing me over the edge and my body spasmed again, my mouth gapping as I let out a scream of pleasure that made my teeth chat. She was moaning and her legs fell down to either side of my head and I had just let go of her and felt something warm and wet against my lips. I looked up and her eyes were closed as if she was asleep so I opened my mouth and sucked in the mixture of our bodies and came in my mouth.</p> <p>She looked down and smiled, then leaned in a bit and put her head down, her face on my chest. "Oh... that was... so... so.. good..." I couldn't tell exactly what she said, but I felt her relax. She laid down on me with a satisfied smile on her face and reached up and began caressing herself while running her fingers through my hair.</p> <p>"You taste so good, I love having you like this" she said, not pulling my head in as she kissed my chest and stomach as I played with my handiwork. "I've been so good for you so much. Did you enjoy that, lover?"</p> <p>"Y... you can say that," I replied, trying to sound as convincing as I could. She moved herself back up and placed her face in my chest again, her leg over me and her pussy just above my cock. I could feel her softness against me, and all I could do was lay there and enjoy, as I wrapped my arms around her and let my hand trail down her back to join mine in caressing her butt. It was then that my head began to swim.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh, God", she purred, her body still shuddering with the after effects. It had never been like this! "Mmm, you taste... delicious!" As she said the word I felt a quiver, and then everything stopped. I was just thinking how amazing my first lesbian orgasm was, and then I felt her body shiver again.</p> <p>"What's wrong, love?" she asked, still resting her head in the crook of my neck from where she was lying on top of me. "Nothing, I'm fine, just feel a little better."</p> <p>"Mmm, well, let's go take care of these babies," I asked, still catching my breath, as she pulled off my shirt and then pulled her shirt off. I got up and we walked into the bathroom where she washed herself in the steamed-over water, and got the shower gel right. I felt her body again, and this time she sat up against me so her breasts were pressed into my chest as I soaped her up in the shower, our sexes pressed together even, and she kissed me.</p> <p>"So, I guess you've done what you hoped?" she asked, before grabbing the towel. It had been years since I had seen a naked woman, but something just seemed right about it as they would move with her and look a little more like they were on her breasts or her back as I massaged them. We both laughed then, and that gave her a feeling of accomplishment she had never felt before. I kissed her again and she pulled on me. "I'm going to give you a little gift, darling," she whispered as she put her arms around my neck and pulled me to her, pushing her tongue down my throat, and then kissing my lips. We kissed for a long time, and I found myself having the same sort of feelings for her that she had for me. When I put my hand on her left buttock and felt the softest and warm flesh of her butt, we kissed passionately, my hand moving up from her left side to her breasts to caress and knead it for her. We lay there kissing for several minutes, but when we felt my stiffness pressing up against her, she broke our kiss and got up the shower gel, putting it in my hand.
