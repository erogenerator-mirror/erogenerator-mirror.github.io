In fact it seemed to intensify every time we kissed. My hand started to slide lower toward her pussy. By now my hand was in the top, and was now under her short skirt. When I felt that she was not wearing panties, I slipped a finger into her vagina.</p> <p>Her hips came up very slightly, then she leaned back against my shoulder. I moved my fingers to her clit, and I felt her pussy muscles contract against them. I felt her body shake a couple of times. After a few moments of this, she leaned forward, and her mouth engulfed mine again. Her tongue and lips danced together like a woman, taking possession of my mouth. We parted our kiss momentarily, and I looked down to see she was wearing a smile and sparkling eyes, glistening with excitement. She pulled my lips back up, and we kissed again, deeply as our tongues probed each other's mouth.</p> <p>It was now my turn to slide my hand around to her backside. Her bottom was tight against my erection, and my hand slid up slowly until it could feel the cheeks of her ass. My fingers slipped into her backside and I began rubbing her anus. She shuddered against my fingers, moaning against my lips.</p> <p>I slid my hand higher, and pulled her skirt up so I could feel closer and better access to her backside. When my fingers touched the crack between her cheeks, she moaned a little louder, and pushed her upper body back into mine. My fingers ran on the inside of her crack until they encountered my finger tip. She pushed back against it, and I felt it slide against my finger tip. She moaned again.</p> <p>I pulled my finger tip away from her and took my finger out of her bottom. She moved back into me, grinding her buttocks against mine. I looked down at her pussy and breasts and took several long slow rubs on each tit.</p> <p>"What do you want?" I whispered to her. She looked up at me, smiled, and said, "Tell me. I want to lick you."</p> <p>"I want to lick you."</p> <p>I slid the tip of my thumb over one of the engorged lips. Its shape wasn't much different from the folds of flesh of my fingers, and a soft moan escaped her lips as I touched it. She pushed against my thumb and I watched her, and she smiled. Then she looked down to see the head of my cock poking against her pubic mound. Her eyes sparkled and she pushed my hand away.</p> <p>"I don't want you to lick me there."</p> <p>I took her hand and placed it between my legs, where I found my cock resting against her. She was very wet and easily slid along it, and as I felt the heat of her lips encircle my shaft, I pushed her finger out to the head and pushed the finger into her ass. She reached down and began to rub her clit, as my thumb slid into her. She was already very wet, but her pussy walls were already slippery with her juices.</p> <p>She pulled her head back and looked down at me. "This is fucking awesome."</p> <p>"I should have known." I smiled, then leaned down to kiss her. I kissed her again, pushing my tongue out into her mouth and probing. Her mouth was open and her mouth was full of my tongue. Our kiss was long, then I removed my lips from hers and stood back to look at her. She looked up into my eyes and said, "I like what you are doing."</p> <p>I knelt by the bed and slid off her skirt and panties. She lifted her feet, and I tossed them behind me. I leaned over her, kissing her thighs for a moment and rubbing the head of my dick against her pussy lips. I took her hand and placed it on my shaft. This time she took me into her mouth easily, and she was very wet. I placed her hand on my shaft and moved my hand from her clit to her ass.</p> <p>I slid my hand back between her legs, along her cleft, and inside her. I rubbed her clit as she fingered herself. I lifted her legs and spread them wide apart while her hand was inside my head. In this position, her pussy was much closer than the floor, so it wasn't quite as uncomfortable. I slipped a finger inside, and she sighed as she felt it go in deeper. I pulled her lips apart, and exposed everything to view. I felt her hand moving my shaft, moving it in an up and down motion, as she moved it up and down with her hand. I slid my fingertip into her and felt the heat of her insâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
