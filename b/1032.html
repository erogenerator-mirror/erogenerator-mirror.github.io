I pushed my hips up and moved forward. I pushed my cock head against her opening, slowly and steadily. "Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes".</p> <p>I took one step back, and then the whole length of my cock was in her tight pussy. I held it there, enjoying the feeling, moving slightly back and forth, pressing forward as I began to move in and out of her. Her pussy was wet and warm, and after a short time, I felt myself enter her. I stayed still for a bit, then started moving in and out, slowly at first, then faster and faster as I felt my cock begin to get bigger and harder. Her pussy seemed to be tighter, as if tighter was the right word - tighter was the right word, tighter it was. She responded with a quickening of her hips, a moan that turned into a louder moan, then a scream.</p> <p>"Don't stop", I heard a woman's voice say, but I couldn't make out anything to indicate. We stayed in this position, my cock fully buried in her pussy, her pussy tight around me. I felt her fingernails on my back, scratching away as her body tensed up and her fingernails grazed my back. She continued to moan with each thrust.</p> <p>When she finally calmed down a bit, I pulled my dick out, and stepped back. I watched her body shake with the aftershocks of her climax in the darkness of the room. She made no move with her eyes, and her pussy seemed to be closed. I took a deep breath, then took a few steps closer until my legs were on the edge of the couch. I knelt down and looked her over a little.</p> <p>A small, but very pretty face smiled up at me. She was maybe 5'5", and I don't think she had ever been in public before. Her legs and her ass looked to be well toned but still had an edge to them, like stockings and panties with seams or something, and all the other stuff that you could get from any store. Her breasts bounced gently as she moved with her breathing, and her skin flushed.</p> <p>"Wow." She said softly. "That was...wow."</p> <p>"You okay?" She asked, looking up at me.</p> <p>"It was...I guess."</p> <p>She moved her hand to her mouth, then looked me in the face. She had a worried expression on her face. "I don't think...I don't remember. Is it...is it okay?"</p> <p>"Sure", I replied, and looked her right in the eye.</p> <p>"It feels...amazing...I'm...I'm not sure what to say. I feel really relaxed." Her voice became quieter again as she got out, "You can stay in." And then to my surprise, "I have a feeling that we'll have a lot of fun."</p> <p>Still holding my shirt in front of her, she leaned up and lightly kissed me on the lips. "I'm sorry for...for...if I didn't get..." This was all beginning to sound like a silly conversation, with this woman giving me a chance to sleep around, even if it was only with the man I was with...the man I just went home to with her. As she leaned down, her lips made contact with mine, and I quickly returned the favor. She pressed her mouth against me, kissing me deeply, with a tongue and hands all over me, exploring, and giving. I started to kiss her back as our tongues tangled together. She pulled her mouth away, and ran her tongue along my lips, my face, my chin, over my neck and ear. Then, she pushed me backwards onto the couch. She moved her hips slowly, taking more and more of me into her.</p> <p>I lay down onto my back, spreading my legs so I could get some of the action. Her mouth came close to my cock, but instead of taking it in there, she put her hand around the middle of the shaft, and ran her tongue the length of it. Then she took it to the back of her throat in one slow gulp. Up and down she took it, letting her tongue slide over the head. She moved her hips slowly as her hand rubbed on the underside, and then continued to play with the hole with her fingers. All the while she kept looking at me, like she was looking for a glimpse of the love of her life. I was having trouble breathing, but I was not complaining, so I was able to catch my breath for a while.
