I don't want to know. Come on; let's go in."</p> <p>She turned the lights on and they walked in, holding hands.</p> <p>"Here," she said. She took off her coat and hung it on the coat tree. Then she handed him a small box. When he reached a look of surprise on his face, she whispered, "Open it."</p> <p>She held his hands and opened the little box, peeling away the layer of dust, dust, and dust and dust until his eyes were covered with the smudgy stuff. He reached down and pulled the cloth over her eyes, then let it fall the rest of the way away.</p> <p>She turned away and started to get another box from her bag. She opened the lid and saw what she had been waiting for. She set the box down on the floor next to her. She pulled back so no more dust would fall, then set it back down.</p> <p>She looked at him as she moved to get a rag to scrub her face.</p> <p>"I don't need this," she said. When he nodded his head, she moved in front of him and sat the rag with her on the floor. When he raised his hands, she told him, "Leave them there, or I'll do something about them." She reached out and pulled his face between her fingers, then wiped it off, kissed it again. He kissed her fingers, then licked them clean. He looked over her shoulder at the pile of dust and dust piled on the floor.</p> <p>When he released her hands to let it drop on the rag, she pulled him to her, and they kissed. Then she went to her bag and took out a blanket. When she laid the blanket out on the ground, she looked up at him and asked, "What's that about?"</p> <p>He just looked at her, then nodded. "I can't believe you asked me any questions."</p> <p>She reached out and ran her fingers across his cheek. "When we finished our shower, I thought I'd make myself invisible, but you look so damned strong when you're all shiny and shiny." She touched his lip and his eyes opened, looking up at her.</p> <p>He looked back down, then back up at her, and said, "How do you know that?"</p> <p>She pulled his hand over against her breasts then leaned down and kissed him. "Do you like my breasts, Jason?" She asked when the kiss ended.</p> <p>That made him laugh. "Yeah I do," he said as he kissed her back.</p> <p>"Are you ready to tell me what happened?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't know if I want to."</p> <p>"You're sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah I am. I'm ready."</p> <p>"I don't know if I want to let you go this first time."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She ran her hand up and down his cheek, brushing hair from his eyes. Then she laid her finger on his lips. "Ssh."</p> <p>He kissed her finger, then his tongue. "Yeah. Kiss me again."</p> <p>She turned to him and moved to the back of the couch, sat down, and put her legs up on the arm of the couch, resting her feet on him, and pulled her hips up to him.</p> <p>He lay his chest down on her, then his head next to hers on the back cushion. He looked up and into her eyes. "Okay," he repeated.</p> <p>"You do," she said.</p> <p>He turned his head away, then ran his fingers over her nipples and her belly, then up, then down again. He ran his hand the length of her thigh, making her legs open, then put them flat on his chest and moved his head back so he could suck her nipples. When she closed her eyes he continued, using his hands to keep her legs opened and open. His tongue and mouth were all over her breasts, with no hands to hold anything above him. He could feel her body tremble as he sucked and nibbled on her nipples. Then he felt her hand on his back, running down toward his ass.</p> <p>He shifted to her side and moved his body lower on her. When he came to her feet, he stopped, and ran his hand up to her knee, then down the inside of her thigh, and up the outside of her other thigh. She moved her feet wider apart. Then he slipped her shorts down and off her legs, leaving her lying on the inside of the couch. He put both hands under her to support her, then started to lick her pussy.</p> <p>"Do it again," she whispered, with a smile.</p> <p>He started with her outer lips then the inner lips, then the inner lips, then ran his tongue upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
