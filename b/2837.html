"I mean... you were the one doing the kissing with the vibrator and the lube." She continued with more serious tone in her voice, "You did it to me because when I had your cock inside me, you felt so good because you were in charge..." She then slipped her finger down onto my clit and started to rub it.</p> <p>"I know what you mean. I love to see you like that when I put the vibe in." She continued to rub my bud and I closed my eyes and bit my lip as pleasure started building in my body. She started to rub harder and faster and my breathing started to pick up and I could feel my legs starting to buckle underneath me and moan out.</p> <p>"You liked that did you? You want me to keep on?" she asked as I looked up at her as she continued to rub my clit.</p> <p>With my eyes half closed, I whispered back, "Oh god do it... I want that to be you and I want to feel you." She increased her stroke and my breathing was getting heavier and my juices were flowing and I was just about to cum. She sped up the pressure and the circles of her finger and started to rub fast. "You want my fingers inside you, don't you?"</p> <p>"Oh god, yes." She was rubbing my clit faster and I grabbed onto the door frame again so that I could grind it against the wall for support. Her fingers continued to slide on my clit and she started to suck hard on its hard little tip while twisting her finger around my bud and sending me ever higher in sexual excitement. All of a sudden, she stopped... her fingers rubbing my little nub and I was disappointed for saying the words. Looking down at my box, I saw what she was waiting for. "What is it?" I asked in a pleading voice.</p> <p>She started to rub my little nub again, "I want to feel you." She continued with that same rhythm and with another set of circles, this time she slowly inserted the dildo and started to rub up and down the entire length of my wet, slick, throbbing cock.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?" I was now moaning again and she did more circles then, "Yes" and I started to feel a wave start to build in my body and then it was on top of that and she could tell from my breathing that I was close. "I want that cum" she said between circles "I want to feel you explode all over my hand." Before she even began to push the dildo into me, I had already wrapped my fist around the dildo and was already using my other hand on my clit as well of that dildo. In my head I thought I was dreaming.</p> <p>"Ohhh" I shouted out as I felt my cock twitch. She slowly fucked my tight little boy pussy as I could feel my orgasm start, slowly build. Her other hand was back between her legs and she was rubbing her clit now too. "Mmm" she moaned. "I want... cum for someone" she said as I felt my body shudder as the waves of ecstasy were coming.</p> <p>She took her dildo out and started to run her hand up and down the entire length of it again and then slowly she guided the dildo into my wet pussy and started to rub it against my lips. While she rubbed the tip of the curved dildo into my wet little cunny, she leaned forward and licked my clit. My moans were now coming now, and again my body was shuddering. "That's it" she told me as I felt the wave start to come to a close but her hand wasn't moving.</p> <p>"Keep going," she said. "You are doing great." I was going to say something else but her finger was still rubbing my clit. "I want you to cum for me baby" she said and then she thrust her finger deep inside my pussy. I felt it hit my G-spot and my pussy started to clench around her finger and my pussy walls squeezed the dildo. I kept feeling the dildo moving in out of my body and it felt like I was milking it for everything I had.</p> <p>I slowly relaxed my eyes and after a moment of silence, she pushed the dildo out and started to come back down to a steady rhythm. After all that, there was no need for us to speak. All of a sudden, the two lovers separated. I was still trying to catch my breath even though we were in total agreement, that she was the one and I would follow. It was not long before she came as she had the pleasure of our love making... only it was better because of me. It wasn't so much aboutâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
