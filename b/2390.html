He exclaimed. "And so wonderful that I just can't wait any more, and you can come too!" He told me as he pulled off his shorts and panties and sat on the edge of my bed. I laid there in my boxers and shirt, feeling his naked body as he leaned over me. His big cock was sticking up towards me and he leaned back and began to stroke his cock, stroking it with his right hand, watching me. He was staring intently at my hairy bush. All of a sudden, he put his fingers aside his hairy fingers and began to rub on my pubic hair. He gently rubbed me there, letting the head of his cock touch my lips. He pulled away from me after a couple minutes, put his fingers in his mouth and sucked off a little more, and then sat back.</p> <p>"I really just couldn't do this, could you?" I said as he leaned on the bed and I followed him.</p> <p>He grabbed the sheet and covered my naked body with it, getting a good look at my big tits again. He moved his body over mine so that he was on a side, and moved his cock between my legs so that it was pointing up towards my stomach. He took the head of my cock in his mouth, letting his tongue tease it and then take over and take over my shaft. His mouth was warm and moist as he massaged me, and I closed my eyes and got lost in it, feeling his mouth on me. He pulled me towards to his cock, and I began to push him back against the headboard as he slowly fucked me with his beautiful cock. It was big and thick, and I felt myself sliding into him inch by inch. His cock felt incredible sliding in and out of me as he moved and I held onto his shoulders, pushing myself into him as I was getting fucked. He felt so warm and hard and I felt his balls against my body again and I moved my hands down and around to grasp his ass, pulling him to me harder and deeper. He was thrusting into me at a quicker pace; my breath was coming in short gasps. He was now pulling me closer to him as I felt myself nearing orgasm.</p> <p>"Please," I said to him. "I'm gonna cum." He said.</p> <p>"Oh shit!" He pulled me up on top of him, his hands grasping my tits as he was coming with me.</p> <p>"I wanna taste!" I said, lifting up, moving around him. I spread his legs more so that he was facing me as I knelt between them and I lowered myself on top of him. I put my hands under my breasts and let them hang down, rubbing them against his cock, rubbing my nipples against his lips, tongue. He sucked each one in turn, then began the motion that only happens when we're really excited and ready. Our eyes were locked on each other and we watched each other as we began to grind our hips together. His cock was so hard, and I was in no mood to just sit passively in his lap. His hands were on my waist and waist, then slid up to my titties. I pulled his head to mine and kissed him. He was still so excited. Our lips still locked and our tongues dancing in and out of each other as the passion grew. And we began to fuck faster. Our hips were rocking and he was grunting as our bodies were thrusting against each other. I was in heaven watching him as I wrapped my legs around him and we moved our bodies faster and faster as our kisses became wilder and hungrier and we began to thrust harder and faster into each other.</p> <p>"I'm cumming!" I screamed.</p> <p>I threw my head back and pulled his face down to mine, kissing him hard as I felt his cock deep inside me as he felt mine deep inside his. His body shuddered as we kissed, and I could almost feel his cock throbbing as he came. It didn't take long. I could feel him thrusting up hard into me one last time and then he leaned back with his forehead resting on my chest where he held my waist. It was one of the most exciting experience ever. We were still holding each other as we came down off our high. I could feel his body slowly relaxing. He pulled me around so that I was lying on him and kissed me again as I let my legs fall down, still on his sides. It felt so good to be in his arms again after what had just happened. He turned us over so that he was on top of me and I was on my back while he started to kiss me again. I was kissing him back hard and we were still passionately kissing.</p> <p>"Now," I whispered into his ear as I put my arms around him and pulled him down to me.</p> <p>"Now?" He asked back, sounding puzzled.</p> <p>"Now!"
