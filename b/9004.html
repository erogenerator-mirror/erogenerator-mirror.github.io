Do what you do.</p> <p>"Just fuck me.</p> <p>She pushed her crotch against his.</p> <p>"God yes! Do it, do it nice and slow...</p> <p>"Push a little more." He was now driving into her.</p> <p>"Just do it.</p> <p>Her hips were now fucking him back.</p> <p>"How big is he, does he make you come when you make love to him."</p> <p>He said, almost whispering in her ears.</p> <p>"Yes." Her eyes were locked on to his.</p> <p>"Yes what?"</p> <p>"It's your turn now.</p> <p>"Take your clothes off."</p> <p>"Do what you have to," He said.</p> <p>"I don't want to take my clothes off."</p> <p>"Well I do and, if I would please, you can strip for me." Her voice was now very seductive and sexy.</p> <p>"Yes," he said, again almost whispering.</p> <p>She stepped nearer to him, moving her hands over his face and shoulders pulling himself closer to her. His cock was almost touching her stomach.</p> <p>"Do you still like me touching you?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, please. Do it now." He kissed her.</p> <p>She stepped closer to him. His cock was right in front of her naked crotch. It was the most erotic experience. They both loved it.</p> <p>"Yes, yes."</p> <p>She pushed her hips against him.</p> <p>"Yes what?"</p> <p>"Fuck me."</p> <p>"What I want isn't my pussy is yours,"</p> <p>They were kissing now. They were fucking on a bed of white sheets and some soft bedclothes. His hands were running over her as they kissed. He had not felt this good in a long time. The feeling of her breasts against him. As their passion increased, it was all she wanted.</p> <p>She ran her hands over his body. Her hands found his cock.</p> <p>Her touch was electric. She rubbed it gently. The pressure was building. It made his balls tingle. His hands took her breasts. He felt the fullness and fullness of them.</p> <p>His cock was now inside of her as it started to make it's way into her pussy. She guided it. They both moved with passion. Their hands made every move. They were both naked. It felt wonderful.</p> <p>"Your turn now" "I want you to come now."</p> <p>She pulled herself away from him. She moved down the bed to the floor and spread her legs. He could see the lips of her cunt. It made him think of his first sex with a woman. The thought made him more excited than he had ever been in his life.</p> <p>He got down on all fours. She had her arms around him. His face was on her cunt. He moved in. This time all the movement involved in sex.</p> <p>After her climax, she stopped fucking him and he stopped moving. He was almost tired.</p> <p>"Are you alright with all that?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Yes. I love the new you too. It is wonderful."</p> <p>"Why you are not as well?"</p> <p>Her words were making him a little dizzy.</p> <p>"This isn't really my first sex in a row, I just thought I can do it."</p> <p>"Yes, yes it is."</p> <p>"You are a lover."</p> <p>"It's a good feeling being told, having someone else tell such an intimate part."</p> <p>"Yes. Do you think I'm being honest with you.</p> <p>"No not very honest. You're loving this, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I am."</p> <p>"I wish we could be the same. You are my best friend and lover and just being able to touch you so much is very special to me. I'm not sure we could be together like this and be happy with each other."</p> <p>"You are, are you sure you are that serious?"</p> <p>"Very. We are."</p> <p>"I'll get dressed when we go to the café."</p> <p>He could only smile.</p> <p>She put her dress on.</p> <p>"I don't wear underwear."</p> <p>"Hm, that's different."</p> <p>She reached under her dress. He watched her.</p> <p>She held two objects.</p> <p>"Here, here." She held a dildo. It was really long and pretty thin one. She pulled him towards her and kissed him.</p> <p>He sucked her tongue into his mouth.</p> <p>"Let's—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
