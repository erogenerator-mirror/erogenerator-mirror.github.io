I needed to feel his hot, thick lips, his hot, hot, cock.</p> <p>He lowered his mouth to my naked mound. He opened his mouth and took me in one long slow motion. He pushed his tongue between my folds as I pushed further into his mouth. I was already so wet I could feel the heat of my inner thighs smearing on his upper lip as we kissed. For someone whom I found sexually repressed, I felt vulnerable to that monster in the back of my very own car. He pushed his tongue inside me and I felt a warm surge run up my spine. He pulled his lips away and looked at me, his face contorted with lust.</p> <p>"Do you want this hot, hard cock?" he asked me. I nodded my head mutely. He laughed at my expression.</p> <p>"You can ask nicely," he said. I nodded my head as he pushed his mouth hard down on mine. His hand was a blur as it went back to me from my breasts, stroking my nipples, caressing them as his mouth was being used. He teased my nipples, pinched them until my body shuddered, my hips bucking. His mouth was a vacuum, sucking on me, sucking my pussy over and over again, causing my body to tremble and buck with a mind of its own. I was so excited I could feel it in my skin, in my bones, even in my throat.</p> <p>He pulled away and sat down again. His hips were already straining with his excitement. I stood, waiting, for him to come over. He knelt in front of me and took my wrist. He led me back to his seat and sat down. He pushed his hand up inside my dress, between my legs. He pulled my pussy lips aside and I had to squirm more and raise myself up a little to get his hand to push past my wet slit. He leaned back at the foot of his car, his face just three feet off the ground, as if he knew nothing of what he was doing. His fingers slipped effortlessly into my pussy, as if it were a new playground entirely. As he moved his fingers deeper and deeper inside me he pulled my lips apart with his thumb. I felt like I was about to cum just as he felt my pussy lips spreading wider, pressing harder on his fingers.</p> <p>It was the most erotic moment of my life. There I was, my young husband at home, being finger fucked by a stranger while his hot, gorgeous lover fucked me from behind. At the same moment, I felt his cock grow harder and harder inside me. The sensation was intense. The pressure increased, getting stronger as his fingers pushed in the center of my slippery walls. It was the same as when he fucked me a moment ago, his body tensing and quivering as he approached his climax.</p> <p>We both let go of each other as one. I saw stars. He pulled away, holding his fingers inside me as he watched me. I saw love gleaming in his eyes. I saw his confidence and power, his dominance. He wanted to prove himself to me again. I watched as he leaned over me, placing his lips over mine. His lips were soft and soft, so sweet and gentle. He kissed me longingly. He pressed deep inside me, and his tongue pushed forward inside my mouth. I returned the kiss, wanting something more, whatever it was that we needed.</p> <p>His hands began caressing my breasts through my bra and dress. I held back, too sensitive to the sensation. I wanted to let him do whatever he wanted to do, but he held my hands away. His finger began touching my nipples, making them feel like they were going to be tortured. I looked at the beautiful face of my husband on that glorious summer day. I didn't think it was possible to have a woman like that make me feel like that about that man.</p> <p>My breasts were rising like rose petals, making me feel a tumbling of lust through me. I felt dizzy, like something hit me in the stomach. His fingers pulled my nipples even further into their hardness as they rubbed my breasts with each upward stroke. The feeling was exquisite. I held my breath and moaned softly against the kiss. It felt almost like an orgasm.</p> <p>He undid my bra, as I had wanted, and slipped it off. My breasts bounced free, my nipples hard like a small finger, the tips dark in the afternoon sun. He leaned down to take one and gently bite it. He pulled the nipple back into his mouth and sucked it in. I let out a moan of pleasure as the first touch of his soft lips touched my nipple. It was an electric shock. My hips bucked uncontrollably as my arousal level rose. His mouth left my breast and went to my other breastâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
