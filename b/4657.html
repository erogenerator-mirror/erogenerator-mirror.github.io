The car started its engine, and the door popped open behind Ben's arm with a clatter, and he saw the lights go on. There stood Ben, his suit pants and bag slung over his shoulder in an elegant line.</p> <p>"Hey there, Ben, I didn't know it was you or my mom in the store, I thought you'd be in the middle of trying out some new things. Is your wife gone?"</p> <p>"You could call her that," he smiled, "but she's home from college now. I heard you called her a babe, but you've no idea what she look like, don't you?" Ben nodded his head.</p> <p>"Well, she's good. That's the last I'll ever see of her."</p> <p>"Well come on in, "I said, "She's home and wants to fix whatever I put into the fridge." As he came in, the door closed.</p> <p>The air temperature in the parking lot suddenly felt warmer.</p> <p>"Ah shit, I'm so sorry. I mean, she said she'd gotten it but couldn't get it fixed and she couldn't tell me it was for her. She just said she was trying it out and told me to tell her no if she didn't want me to. My God, did the car in reverse! She didn't even try to open and shut it. I guess that's why I didn't open the bag when I saw it, "I guess that's why it looks like it's a gift."</p> <p>"Are you having a good time shopping, Ben? " he asked.</p> <p>"This is a pretty exciting time," he smiled and leaned down, putting an arm across my shoulder, "I hope I didn't catch you trying to open a trunk. You can't open it in the middle of the night."</p> <p>"I see. You should do some work in the car shop or something," he said, and I could feel the bulge my cock was making in his pants. I knew he was about to have an experience unlike any he'd ever had. This is just what I always wanted, someone like him was going to be able to take me in his arms.</p> <p>"No you shouldn't," I protested, "I shouldn't be feeling this horny, and it's just us." "Hey, don't think anyone's going to stop you, right? " Ben looked at me with his handsome, deep blue eyes and smiled. "Hey, I'm still your friend," he said, "and I'm a grown man. Can I at least take a walk in the park and chat with you?" He raised an eyebrow at me. "Or have you never had a foot rub? "</p> <p>"I've never had a foot rub," I objected, "And no, you should go. It is a nice day, you're a walking, not a mass transit worker." We were both laughing, and I reached out and squeezed his shoulder.</p> <p>"Well if there's anything I can, um, help you with, I'm game," he said, and his hand went up my sweater. I jumped off the car when he touched a part of my breasts, and I looked down and saw the huge bulge in his jeans as it poked up under his jeans. "I would love that."</p> <p>"Really, I'd love that, "she replied, and then gave him a quick hug and a kiss and led him back toward our house. He grabbed my hand and headed for the stairs to the basement, and I followed him in two steps to follow, "We can't just go upstairs."</p> <p>The garage door opened, and we entered the room again, "You can go in first, or come in second and sit down," he instructed.</p> <p>"Why does this have to be going upstairs anyway?" I asked, "There doesn't anyone else in here."</p> <p>"It's for me, silly. I don't think we're going to have any issues with you sitting here with me. You really don't have a choice here, do you?" He looked around the room. "I've got an office in this room, and I have a lot of stuff that need to be finished if we're going to do this in there."</p> <p>"I do have one other question though," I said.</p> <p>"Of course sweetie," he smiled and went back to looking through some more racks. "Are you going to do it in there?" I nodded, "Or were you planning on coming in?"</p> <p>"No, not really, we're just going to have to see where everything goes. I just want to make sure everything is clean."</p> <p>"I betâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
