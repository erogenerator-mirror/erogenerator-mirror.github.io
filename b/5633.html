The other guy you were with had a vasectomy. I was lucky enough to get a piece of pussy. They wanted to be alone, but I figured it was for me."</p> <p>"I don't understand." I told her.</p> <p>"The thing I didn't have was a big cock, but it made enough noise to drive me crazy."</p> <p>"Is that what all the guys say when they are with you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Why didn't you use a condom with me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Why didn't you use a condom when John came in and you were having sex?"</p> <p>"I was drunk."</p> <p>"You were drunk then?"</p> <p>"I'm married now."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>He kept getting harder and harder.</p> <p>I thought I was going to die.</p> <p>He said. "I don't know."</p> <p>"I think you're right. I'm on my way out."</p> <p>I wanted to just sit up on our bed and die.</p> <p>I told him. "I'll walk you back home."</p> <p>"It's not that I don't like you. If you want to continue we'll continue."</p> <p>I stopped for a moment to take a breath then continued.</p> <p>John reached for his pants then said. "Wait."</p> <p>I got up and he told me not to make his bed.</p> <p>I took a few steps toward the stairs then stopped.</p> <p>I walked up the stairs to John's room.</p> <p>He was asleep on the bed, wearing a nightshirt.</p> <p>I got into his bed and lay there.</p> <p>I didn't even think about the fact that I was not asleep but decided not to tell him the truth.</p> <p>I woke the next morning to a knocking at my door. I just got out of the shower. I opened the door to see Brian, my roommate, standing there looking at me.</p> <p>He said. "This is Brian."</p> <p>He was my roommate after high school. I guess I had been getting a hard time keeping it.</p> <p>I had been in bed with other guys since we started dating. I usually slept naked after that. The thought of Brian seeing me naked made me hot.</p> <p>I opened the door to Brian and we went in.</p> <p>I said. "This is my roommate. Brian."</p> <p>As we walked into the living room he said. "Good morning, I saw you going to school here."</p> <p>I said. "Good morning, you too."</p> <p>I sat down. Brian had a big smile on his face.</p> <p>I said. "If he sees you naked he'll have another hardon."</p> <p>He just laughed and said. "I don't believe it. I mean you are a very attractive guy but I can't see him getting another hardon."</p> <p>John asked. "Is that right?"</p> <p>He laughed and said. "Yeah, John, why don't you come in."</p> <p>John came in. He looked at me and said. "Are you sure."</p> <p>I had said something else and Brian said. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>I could tell from his tone he was really uncomfortable. I could also tell I really wanted to kiss him.</p> <p>I said. "I just want to kiss him, not fuck."</p> <p>Brian looked at me a little longer then said. "That won't be a problem. I can see I'm going to be a pain in the ass."</p> <p>"Really? Why do you have to be such a little slut."</p> <p>"I'm not. I just want to be sure he sees me, not just look at me. It's what I did last night. I know I should tell him."</p> <p>"Brian, you don't have to tell him that you're the hot girlfriend of a guy with a big hardon."</p> <p>He laughed and replied. "Look at myself."</p> <p>"Okay, okay."</p> <p>"He's staring at me. That can't be true."</p> <p>Brian said. "It is all wrong."</p> <p>"It's fine. If you need a shoulder to cry on just say. He doesn't have to see you naked."</p> <p>"I'll call him tomorrow."</p> <p>He smiled and walked out of the room. I thought I had offended him. I wasn't going to let that happen. I wanted him gone so much. I also wanted for him to see the look on my face.</p> <p>I said. "I don't think we should do anything other than talk about this."</p> <p>"Well then you have to tell him," Brian said.</p> <p>I smiled back and said. "Okay. I'll see you tomorrowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
