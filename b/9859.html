That's when the first time it happened she said something like "I love you, but you're such a big girl."</p> <p>"I was just experimenting with your body."</p> <p>"No. Not in the way I thought," she said. "The thing I liked about it is you and I both like to be touched up, that's all."</p> <p>I laughed when I said that and put my hands on her shoulders in surprise. I'd been so busy studying her body and how her breasts would go under a sweater and bra. Her breasts were so big, so different. Not that I'd ever been interested in hers.</p> <p>"Can you sit on the couch, please?" she asked.</p> <p>"Why?" I asked, confused.</p> <p>"Can't I sit on the couch while you're playing with yourself?" She asked.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Is this a date?" she said.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not going to be a cunnilingus if I'm going to be doing all of that to you."</p> <p>"I thought it was something like your fantasies, though."</p> <p>"No it's nothing like that. I'm not playing with myself. I'm just playing with you, I think."</p> <p>"I agree, but you don't play with me either, and I don't want to. That's why we're going to play." He pulled his shorts down and off, revealing his growing hard-on.</p> <p>"No," she said.</p> <p>"I'm not going to lie. If you're going to be naked, let me do it for you," he said.</p> <p>"It's okay with me." She grabbed the zipper of his shorts and pushed them down his legs, giving him a little more privacy.</p> <p>"You do have a nice ass," he said running his hands over it.</p> <p>"It's not as full as I used to. I'll just have to give it a little time, you know."</p> <p>"No. I'm not going to be able to sit for you for a long time again tonight. Besides, I think you need to feel comfortable and I'm sure I'll give it another try."</p> <p>She pulled her little sweater up over her breasts and dropped it on her lap before lying on her back. She took her hands and ran them between her legs. I stared at the two of them with a mix of jealousy and pleasure as she rubbed circles around her nipples.</p> <p>"Your boobs are so soft," I said.</p> <p>"Yes you do. They taste different."</p> <p>"Don't worry," I said leaning over and putting my tongue in her mouth. "The only thing is going to be different is if you want to cum in my mouth." I was pretty sure they'd orgasm together.</p> <p>"Thank you, Michael," she said.</p> <p>I pushed her knees open and slid between them. I slid my erection along her crease and up to her clitoris. I was just trying to get a feel for whether her clitoris would feel good. If she was going to be a virgin I would definitely like to give it a test drive.</p> <p>"Michael," she said.</p> <p>It was like she was a zombie, I couldn't tell if she was in a trance or not. I was trying to get enough pleasure to stay awake.</p> <p>"No, you need to learn to think about how to tell what to expect," I said. "How do the guys do it?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she said.</p> <p>"I'll teach you," I said before licking her clitoris.</p> <p>"No," she said again, but not loud enough.</p> <p>I stuck a finger in her vagina and rubbed her around. A little more wetness there and I knew she'd like it. I kept working her clitoris and trying to bring her to orgasm. She let out a moan and started bucking against me and her legs started giving out. I slowed down as she reached down to grab herself, and her legs were shaking when I pulled my fingers away.</p> <p>"What was that for?" she asked.</p> <p>"Letting me know you liked it," I said.</p> <p>"That sounds interesting. What do you want me to do first?"</p> <p>"You can use anything."</p> <p>"Anything except your fingers?"</p> <p>"No," she said. Her stomach was still convulsing.</p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>She turned over and crawled onto my lap. Her breasts were pointing towards my face.
