But that didn't stop me. I pushed hard and with a massive thrust, my cock plowed into her with all of its might.</p> <p>I grunted and groaned and we grunted and groaned and we were both ready to cum. Not a great way to describe it, but I was grunting more loudly and deeper than normal as my cum spurted into her pussy.</p> <p>"Uh...uh...uh...." I grunted, "God...you feel so fucking good. You felt so fucking good!"</p> <p>"You feel good, too," she said as she lay there panting for air. "That's it; that's the best fuck you've ever had. You really liked it, huh?"</p> <p>She was still a little breathless and seemed to be in another world.</p> <p>"Did it feel good, baby?" she asked.</p> <p>"Mmm...you know I did," I replied.</p> <p>I rolled off her and lay beside her. She looked over and saw that I was still hard and stroked my cock, "I think I wanted you as much as you wanted me, lover. I've wanted you for years and now I'm yours; only yours."</p> <p>"I can't move," I said.</p> <p>"Me either," she said.</p> <p>"I think I should be leaving too," I said.</p> <p>"But, I have to get home in less than an hour," she said, "and take a bath. I'll be back in five to pick you up. Then, you can take all of your clothes off."</p> <p>My mind whirled with confusion and I quickly grabbed my shorts and started to straighten up.</p> <p>"You know, you were amazing, baby," she said. "Just keep quiet about it."</p> <p>I laughed.</p> <p>The two of us were naked when we walked out the door to my car. She grabbed my ass in the back seat and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"I'm taking it to town, right now," she said. "I want to get rid of you, but don't let me catch you fucking another man in my bed and I want you to take me home." She pulled her shirt over her head, exposing her chest.</p> <p>"That's enough for now, lover."</p> <p>I sat and watched her slip into her shorts and slip her shoes on. We were alone, but a part of me was still turned on. That was the first time I was ever turned on.</p> <p>I closed the car door and turned to her.</p> <p>"I really like you, Angel. I don't know what came over me but I love you."</p> <p>She snaked her arms around me and we kissed again. She broke off the kiss and said, "I really love you."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>She climbed into her car and drove home as I watched her pull out of the driveway and leave.</p> <p>I drove toward the airport when the urge to go back on the job became so strong I had to do something. It was Monday night, and I had been on the airplane all week, not counting the week before. The desire to return to our jobs was overwhelming as I drove by the store.</p> <p>But, we didn't. We both had to get up early, which didn't happen too often enough to give my stomach something to clench up with. I didn't even know what to do, just put my head under my covers and get some sleep. I had to think about what I would do when the day of the reunion arrived.</p> <p>The day before the reunion seemed every bit as bad if not worse. I was looking forward to my time with her. I decided to come clean and go visit the store, since I had no reason to leave. I walked into the store feeling relieved, relieved that it would be our last time together.</p> <p>The store manager, a cute, plump woman dressed in a business card, greeted me and we exchanged pleasantries. But, it seemed my heart was set on doing the same. I needed to talk to her, I needed to discuss something that my time with her had just ended. I started to head toward the coffee counter before she interrupted me again.</p> <p>"You look tired. Did you have a good rest?" the woman asked, "I'm the only other employee in the store."</p> <p>She had a point, as I could feel my nerves getting worse by the secondâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
