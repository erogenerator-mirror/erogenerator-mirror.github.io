She's gorgeous. Long, beautiful hair, her mouth-watering skin, and her eyes, if she could even call them that, were green. I imagined looking down the top of those beautiful breasts, down her torso to her waist, and my cock jumped in my underwear when I thought of her pussy. To be honest, I've never been with a woman; there's nothing to compare what I experience with my other experiences. The reality has to be different.</p> <p>I'm not sure what to do. I know I'm looking for intimacy. I can't look at her face, or hear her voice. Her eyes are so much like her legs, and I can't see her hand, which I know, of course, only happens in movies. I have to find out who I am and what I want to do with myself.</p> <p>"We can go to my apartment."</p> <p>"No, I want you to do something. You know I'm so nervous," she said. "Please, we can talk on the way there, if you'd like." And with that, my lips found her forehead, and kissed the bridge of her nose. She looked up, with surprise. I leaned in. "It's okay." We kissed again. She put her hands on my back.</p> <p>"My name is Rebecca, Rebecca," I said. "I've heard so many things about you."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm glad not all the girls do." She blushed, and we kissed again.</p> <p>"I was wondering," I started, "if any of them ever did anything like that before, I mean, they don't have the courage. How does it work to go from here, from where I stand, to where I guess it has to be in the bedroom, and you have to come over here?"</p> <p>"It's kind of a long, but, well, you know. I'm pretty nervous." She giggled. "It's okay, I understand."</p> <p>"I'm sorry if that's, . . . I didn't mean to put it that way. I'm sorry I said that." I didn't respond to her apology, but in the back of my mind, I could see that she understood. I think she wanted to get us started, and that's why I came to dinner.</p> <p>We talked about how we felt about each other. It was like we had known each other for years. It was easy for me to talk about stuff about the opposite sex, but I'm pretty shy around girls. That was part of my frustration. I mean, it's possible that I'd be more open, than I was before, and it's possible that I'd be less confident, but I don't want to take advantage. I'm not sure what it is that I don't do, and I don't know very much about myself at all. I like being different.</p> <p>"This was going to help me start this afternoon with us talking about some things that we've shared with each other in the past," she said. "I, well, I never really did figure you or any of the guys out. I would of guessed that you and I might end up with a lot of common interests, but I guess I was never too sure. I don't know, the only thing I know is it's a lot more than that."</p> <p>"You're not the only one that knows." I said, then added softly, "I'm sorry that I've been so open with you." And then I pulled her into my arms and we kissed.</p> <p>I reached into the suitcase again and took out a pair of pants and a sport coat. She looked at me and said, "Are we going to sit in the park?" I agreed and we put our clothes on and went back to the car.</p> <p>I couldn't wait for her in the park. As I watched her walking away, I couldn't believe how much I cared about her. I thought, "I really do hope she likes it."</p> <p>We went by her and sat down near the far end of the walkway and looked at different parkes, until we turned out to be near the old railroad track. We walked about a hundred feet before I saw a car pulling into the lot, and looked around. There were two women sitting outside. They smiled at us. We didn't notice them until they reached a halt, and the door was closed. They laughed at something I wasn't sure how to tell, but all of a sudden, a car with the name "Johnathan" came speeding up ahead of us. This was it. And it made me so fucking wet thinking that I was going to cum there right after.</p> <p>Just as they stopped and turned to go back to the carâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
