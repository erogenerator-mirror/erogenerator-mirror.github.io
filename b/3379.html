It was beautiful, just like the forest. I wanted us to explore the land in its lushness. Soon, we were out of sight of the other humans; we'd be in our own territory.</p> <p>As I looked around, I began to sense a bit of a magic aura wafting into our presence. It was the smell of wild and beautiful foliage. We were in the middle of a forest of thick bushes. The trees had all of their shade and the shade was deep enough to conceal everything from view.</p> <p>I looked again at my map and noticed it was pointing at a spot with a green tree a bit below the bush. When I looked up, I found I could make out a small grove of trees where the ground had a high degree of green as well as foliage. It was very cool to my feet and it seemed warm but not quite at all warm. As I gazed further and further into the trees, there was something of a green and yellow variety in sight.</p> <p>I could also sense that the forest could be dense. It began to wind up as we continued towards the other side of the forest, and as I watched I could tell that we were almost to a small spot where a few trees stood on their opposite sides.</p> <p>When we reached the tree, we stood for a long minute or so to admire the scenery and then we both began to look towards it. When we did, I found I could make out a thicket of branches with some sort of plant just above it. What appeared to have been a brush path led straight to a larger grove of trees that was just above the level of the main river and a little further west where the trees sat. I could see that the foliage seemed to be green as the river turned in and out. It was as though a brush path had been carved out of the foliage and there were no trees in sight.</p> <p>Now that I knew we weren't looking around, I quickly realized it was all there. The only thing that seemed out of the ordinary was a few trees that looked like a small creek. All I could see was this large forest with a large variety of trees and bushes. We walked around a small clearing we were on and I took each tree to the ground. A few times, I felt that I had reached a point in the tree trunk I was in and then some of the branches would move just to the right to give us access to the path. My excitement was growing and I couldn't keep my excitement in check anymore, so I kept myself completely naked but for shorts. It made me feel as though the only clothes I was wearing were what I had on.</p> <p>Soon we reached an overgrown area where a small waterfall ran through a small waterfall. The stream we had been walking through soon started to flow and the river continued flowing. It was almost like a flowing river from below and I had no idea how long it would go. The flow of the stream was still flowing gently, and I began to get more comfortable with the whole feeling of the water flowing around me.</p> <p>As the water continued to flow into my stomach, I began to feel a bit dizzier and a little dizzy. I began to look for something to cover myself up with and felt my shorts being removed by a strong hand. Quickly, I turned my head towards the waterfall and saw that it was a clear blue color where the water had been flowing. When I looked closer, I saw only green grass. Then, I suddenly felt a pair of hands running along my legs and around my chest. I was about to protest that I could not find my shorts, but I quickly realized that it was coming from above. Quickly, I could smell the grass and it was a thick stinky smell which reminded me of the jungle. My mind again tried to come up with something to cover myself up with but my rational mind said against everything that might be in my immediate future with the way of things. That was a lot of time spent exploring and experimenting in our mind, so I let them hold me a bit.</p> <p>However, as soon as I felt their arms around me once more, it seemed that I suddenly realized I needed to wear something too. When I put down the scissors to see if I could find my underwear, it struck me very funny that it seemed as though my arms were going to be pulled away from my body before they took hold of the scissors. When I brought the scissors to my eyes, I found they had not been in the same spot I had been. The smell of my hair and some of the grass still stung and I couldn't tell exactly if it was from being too heavy. Either way, it made me feel a nice sense of peace and I did my best to remain in place for a while.
