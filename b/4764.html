And, thank you for asking, by the way, we can keep in touch, so keep yourself very busy, just don't get your name out, OK?"</p> <p>It's my mom, by the way, and my roommate. He's my best friend. My mom, her sister. That's her name now. My mom is just after my dad. My mom is only forty three, and we are very close. It's her job to help me see the world as I get older, and to be there for me. But, my mom is also my best friend. We met when I was eleven. And, that's what it is, friends over the years. She's forty five, and we're a good friend to each other too, so keep your friends in line, OK? She, or you, are the only one, to make it. And she does make herself at home with me."</p> <p>"So, um, how are we going to spend these three weeks together?" I am trying not to sound like a dumb blond, like some lame-assed girl.</p> <p>She does not respond to me, but she does not answer because she is still too quiet in her story. She is not saying anything, but she has me in her mind.</p> <p>"I have all that sorted now, so just take me up to your room and just fuck me, I'll do the same if you're more comfortable. After the first time, you should know, I just wanna fuck. "</p> <p>Now she is silent. I am in her mind. A small voice, she wants to say something else. What do you say? What do you want me to do? Oh, yeah. You want me to give you my last cherry? You want me to just fuck you silly? I guess that is ok, right? Well, I have some ideas already, I just don't feel like cooking for you. I like you to cook, so I did too. Let's go.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>The next morning my mom told me her sister went shopping with my parents. My dad's family. Mom called that night and told me that something was going on at her house, that she was going to a bar. Not to be bothered about it, but I was pissed.</p> <p>"What is it, my mom? Something else, I will be there alone."</p> <p>"Come home with me." That's a little bolder than saying anything. That will make it easier to get in, if it doesn't bother you. I guess a good tip is not exactly required.</p> <p>When I came home that night, my mom said that a friend of hers said that they would not stay overnight. She then left it at that, with her. I guess my mom likes that.</p> <p>That night, we had dinner. Mom really liked Chinese food, I just like Chinese. We sat and talked, and it was really starting to feel good and comfortable. I was liking it more and more. I was sitting on my bed with the lamp on. The clock on the wall said eleven. It was time to get up. I wanted to have a shower, but she was right. I had nothing of a clean place to go, and if I went home tonight, I would be walking on water. There were the usual issues of where I was going to go, what to do, etc. But, at least now, I had something to go home to. My mom had told me that she wanted me to have someone who would love me. Someone who was happy with me, who was doing good for me. One person who would be grateful for everything I have. One who would listen to what I wanted.</p> <p>A warm and friendly but passionate kiss with lips, and then it was my shower, and my date with my girlfriend. I was surprised. My girlfriend has never ever been interested in dating, but she was really turned on. I was pretty sure I had found love and affection in my girlfriend, but she was looking for a real man, the one with a good cock. I was really surprised how excited I was to be single in a new area, to be able to have friends I didn't even know. My relationship with my girlfriend had ended and I was really looking forward. I guess we are even.</p> <p>About two weeks after that first day, I was waiting for my mom, I had on a clean and wrinkled t-shirt, which she always sleeps in wearing just a t-shirt, if you want to guess, or a short tennis skirt.</p> <p>"Can I get you something?" I said.</p> <p>"Oh, yes." She said. I picked her up and sat beside her at the food court. I looked at her. She looked amazing, she has long dark hair and dark eyes.
