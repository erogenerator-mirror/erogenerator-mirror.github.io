I'd like to."</p> <p>"What will you do when you come by? It's not the end of your game."</p> <p>"I'll do anything for you."</p> <p>"How would you like to come to a party? I've arranged for a few of our friends. We're going to a restaurant where we're going to have a small party. I can't wait. I've even invited friends to the party. My sister's been really interested in you, is everything okay?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Fine. You'll come."</p> <p>"Do what?"</p> <p>"I want to come."</p> <p>"You'll come in and come."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I don't know. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"I like your mouth on me."</p> <p>"I like your mouth on me."</p> <p>"I like your mouth on me."</p> <p>"I love your mouth on me."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>"I got a good idea about what you would like to do..."</p> <p>"... in one night. If you want to stay with me."</p> <p>"I want to stay with you."</p> <p>"I don't care. I've made myself ready. I'm a little nervous. I'll stop. I'm not ready to do anything, but I'm ready to come to an end. I'd like for us to go on a date."</p> <p>"Okay," she says with a smile.</p> <p>"But don't we need some protection?"</p> <p>"Of course, I'll just do our thing."</p> <p>"Just don't push it into my head. You get one that won't hurt anyone."</p> <p>"That's okay. We'll know by tomorrow."</p> <p>"Can't we just let this go and be a couple?" she asks.</p> <p>"Right now I don't know. We can't go on long."</p> <p>"I don't care. You get the idea."</p> <p>I watch her walk to the bathroom, still trying to decide if I want to see her again, or fuck her brains out. She turns to me, holding her hands open, in that sexy voice of hers, "What does this mean?"</p> <p>"It means that I'm going to spend the next few months at a hotel."</p> <p>"Can you wait until I get home and see if I can be alone with you?"</p> <p>"I will make you happy."</p> <p>"Promise?"</p> <p>"I promise."</p> <p>I watch her walk back into the bedroom. She stands with her back to me and looks at herself with a mischievous expression. "Just checking," she says. "Just check everything."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I ask.</p> <p>"No, it's just a thought. So please do. It's just one time."</p> <p>I watch as she makes her self, inching herself closer into me. God, I love this woman. I can't get enough of her.</p> <p>"I can't tell you what my thinking is. I'm sure I've never felt this way about anyone before, especially not at work." I feel her relax against me, her hands on my face. "So I guess we're going to have one night together after work on our own time. You can come back Friday evening, if you like. And if you come back after my break I don't want to be late."</p> <p>"I've been thinking about it. I've even masturbated thinking about you, about your mouth. I can't get enough."</p> <p>"And I don't mind. I'll keep you safe and happy."</p> <p>"Thank you." We kiss, one of those deep, passionate kisses. Maybe I deserve it... I don't know. Either way, I hope she'll get more in the future. "Are you sure you won't come home?"</p> <p>"We're not going to talk about anything I want to do."</p> <p>"Okay?" she replies with a smile in her voice.</p> <p>I nod. She turns off the light and goes to get rid of just some clothes.</p> <p>"Do you want to go into the other room?" she asks.</p> <p>"Do you have another towel?" she asks as she puts on a skirt and a blouse.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>She's very pretty in her white blouse with a matching skirt that is not quite as short as my own.
