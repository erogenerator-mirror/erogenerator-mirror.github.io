"I'm gonna go change into something nicer."</p> <p>"Honey, you need to get back in the shower," I teased.</p> <p>Dana smiled sweetly at me and reached over to stroke my cheek. "There's nothing sexier. I don't care about the boys. Let's just enjoy ourselves."</p> <p>I pulled her close and we walked over to the hot tub and she sat down. While she was out of the hot tub I took a couple of minutes to grab her hair, hand it back over her shoulder to tie, and unclasp it.</p> <p>"I'll take care of that when you get back to your room?" I asked as I stepped into the hot tub.</p> <p>"Sure, babe. Take your time," she answered.</p> <p>I got out of the tub first, dried her off, and joined her in the tub, where I lay her in between my body and the back of the tub. She spread her legs and put them up for me to lay between, putting both her knees against my chest. I slid my arms around her, cupping her firm body and feeling the curves of her ass under my fingertips. She leaned back against my chest with her back pressed against my hard body. She rested her head against my shoulder as I lay my other arm around her and played with the small tuft of dark brown hair that she had left covering her pussy. I felt her shiver when my fingers first slipped under the edge of her bikini. As my fingers slid around her pussy lips, her entire body jolted a little.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry, baby," she said as her hips moved and she made little sounds that she hoped didn't sound like a sigh of frustration. "That hurt."</p> <p>"It doesn't bother me," I said. "I love making you feel good."</p> <p>"You know I don't care if you make me feel good," she stated, taking my hand and squeezing gently. "You're the first man I've been with, so you'll just have to be honest with yourself when you get home."</p> <p>I put my arms around her and played with her breasts, feeling those hard little peaks that she so liked when I sucked or bit on them. Her nipples became long and pointy, poking out hard against my palms. If one of us was lucky enough, she would arch her back to let me have a good feel.</p> <p>"God, that feels good!" she exclaimed and I realized that she was in pain. "I haven't been with anyone in a long time."</p> <p>"I know you don't like it; it's just painful," I said as I pinched her nipple, causing her to arch her back again. She was quiet while she relaxed on the bottom edge of the tub, and for the first time ever she let her head rest against my shoulder as her eyes closed. Finally, she let her head lean back against my cheek. She ran her fingers through my hair and I stroked that soft, sensitive skin next to mine.</p> <p>"Let's get some sleep. We'll be back in a little while," I said softly as I pulled back with my arms. I could feel her eyes getting a bit heavy as I got up and stepped out of the tub.</p> <p>"You're still cold?"</p> <p>"No," she said as she turned the shower on. "Now that I've started, I'm feeling a little better."</p> <p>I leaned on the shower wall and looked in the mirror. I was getting hard again just from looking at her and from the way she was reacting to me. There was some light in the bedroom, and I could see her reflection in the mirror. She looked back at me expectantly and I bent over and kissed her cheek. She didn't turn over or even look back.</p> <p>"You okay?" I asked softly. "You never said anything about anything that happened, and I didn't think it would get you down."</p> <p>"I'm okay," she mumbled as she got herself under the water again. "It's just been a long while and I don't know how to say it."</p> <p>My fingers were under the water again and I rubbed her thighs as I worked my way up between her legs.</p> <p>"Let's get naked again first. Then I'll make it all better," I said as I dropped my boxers to the floor and pulled her close to me. I felt the tips of her fingers against my back as she began to stroke my cock.</p> <p>"You're hard again already, aren't you," I asked, surprised.</p> <p>"Yes," she said in a quiet voice asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
