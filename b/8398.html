'Yes,' he grunted, 'yes!' Her eyes were closed now as she ground her pelvis hard against top of his, moving up and down again. As her excitement rose, she slid her thighs harder and harder over and over, rubbing the underside of him, his balls now, the feel of them as she felt their weight and shape as she ground her crotch against him again. 'Yes,' he grunted again, pressing himself, trying for some sort of release now, needing it to. 'Yes, yes, oh yes!'</p> <p>A final long thrust and then she stopped, her face tight against him, her forehead against his and then her face was cradled in the crook of his neck as she rocked her crotch against him, her head now turned to his side. He opened his eyes and was delighted at the wonderful feel of her wet pussy, its heat and moistness. The smell of her, the aroma of her, was intoxicating and he realised they were both perspiring a little, the sensation bringing him closer to orgasm by adding to the excitement in his body. She turned suddenly to face him again, her face just above his. 'Oh yes,' she whispered. 'Yes!'</p> <p>He was in heaven as she pressed her belly with her fingers on either side of his face. 'Yes, fuck me, put it in me!"</p> <p>He reached up and ran his hand over her breasts, his hands taking firm grip on her small firm breasts. She leaned forward into him, her own breasts now pressing hard upwards into his hands. Their mouths met, their tongues probing each other as they kissed deeply. When the kissing stopped, he reached down with one hand, sliding his fingers between her legs, her wetness coating it as he ran them upward and up toward her belly.</p> <p>He stopped and felt the pressure from her buttocks as she sat hard on his knee. He had a strong urge to lift her off him, to fuck her again, to put his cock within her and make her his forever. As he slid his fingers up her and up again, he took his hand away and held the two together, just long enough for her to lie back on his chest as he brought his other hand up to her. Her head hung over his chest, her face resting against his skin.</p> <p>'I have something of mine of mine that I want you to wear," he breathed. 'I am going to ask you a few questions, but as soon as I do that you may tell me if it gets to that point.'</p> <p>She lifted herself to look into his eyes as he spoke.</p> <p>"First of all, I want to know if you can be trusted with this, and also with us if we are to really be partners."</p> <p>"So, what do I say?" she smiled, "I like the old motto 'What does she say in return,'" she turned back to him. "I am also going to try being dominant."</p> <p>She took his hand and brought it to her breast.</p> <p>"Touch."</p> <p>He felt it, a large soft cup like she had told him to.</p> <p>She turned back to him. "You can tell me how you feel when I am in your position, and what you expect from me. What do you want me to do?"</p> <p>"I want my body to move from my mind to yours."</p> <p>She pulled his hand to her breast. "Now, take me, take me hard, hard and long." She rolled her pelvis against his leg as he moved his hand up again, and her nipple became hard. "You just go ahead, there's no pressure, there is just love for me."</p> <p>He watched her, his lips moving over her neck. Feeling the warmth of her skin under his fingers, the light brushing of her hair over him as her head turned.</p> <p>"You know this is very new for me, and very thrilling for me, I can't quite believe how I feel. You feel exactly as I have imagined, feel my own desires and desires come to life. And you also get to be an amazing lover. But you are not a lover, in my mind you are more a slave who wants to be a great lover for me. I have no idea what that feels like, and I don't think you could give me this chance, but your hands and fingers seem to be able to do it."</p> <p>As he lay there watching her he had to pause for a second.</p> <p>"I have the feelings right now that I was too scared to let you have," he whispered to her.
