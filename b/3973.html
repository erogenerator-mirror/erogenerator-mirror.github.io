Oh! Oh! Oh! My body begins to writhe as his mouth moves up and down on me - he has a rhythm going and I can feel his finger pushing into me right up to the knuckle. Oh! I try to move my hips against him but he stops me. I get the point – he slides that finger out of me but continues up to the knuckle - this time to my G-spot. Oh! Oh! I can feel it starting to expand in my pussy and I begin to squirm, making a wet splashing sound as I continue to squirm about on the bed. It seems to go from full on orgasm to full on convulsion which starts to ripple out of my body, starting somewhere deep inside my spine and radiating outward, along my sides and to the tip of my head. Oh! Oh! Oh! God is he doing that to me? As he feels me shaking, I feel his finger suddenly stop deep inside me – but as I begin to calm down, he slides that finger back out of me and I'm out of breath again. I lie there a long time, my vision blurting out my thoughts but I can't focus them anymore - I'm still coming down from the intense pleasure, but I feel refreshed, and not at all sore in a different way. Oh!</p> <p>I hear him say to me, softly "God, you're so beautiful. I can't think of anything more beautiful to make love to you. Are you still coming down?" I'm not sure, but I'm feeling even worse. "Can you ever come down? Is it all you can stand?" That makes me so angry. "I hate you, I hate you! I hate my friend! And I hate you." The words seem so weak, it makes me feel weak. I'm shaking so bad.</p> <p>"Oh, you really are a nice friend, aren't you?"</p> <p>"What have you done to me?" he responds.</p> <p>I hear him sit up from the side of the bed. He turns to me and I look up at him. "Please, please stop it. Don't make me do that to myself." It's not really true, just the truth – but I can tell he does want to hear me admit it.</p> <p>"Yes, I did." He says as he smiles at me. He pulls on his shorts and tosses the pillow to the chair. His cock is already half-hard and sticking out of his shorts.</p> <p>He smiles down at me. "You're not to touch it or anything else until I say you can." He pats himself, moves to the side of the bed, and turns on a lamp near the night stand.</p> <p>"That's the idea." I mutter. I'm shaking so bad.</p> <p>"Yes...yes. It's a pity I don't let you cum." I hear him say in a voice, more of an invitation than a command. I hear the edge of a laugh in the room then I feel his hand grasp my face as he kisses me.</p> <p>I'm so startled and so much embarrassed I almost break out in goose flesh. It's not the first time he kissed me and kissed me so sweetly on the lips that night, but he's never touched me more than he was just moments ago. It's like he's touching me here – just for a second. I hate myself. I really hate him. Why are these feelings so different from all the pain from my father? Why are he always talking like that?!</p> <p>"Please... don't say please when we kiss." I think.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." He says again, in that sweet and caring voice that always makes me feel loved. He reaches down and cups my right breast, rolling the nipple between his fingers, as he kisses me. Oh! Oh! Ohhhh! I can't breathe. I think I can hear him. God, please let me cum! The kiss goes back and forth for almost a minute. I don't know what to do. I'm breathing hard, but I don't do anything to stop.</p> <p>At last the kiss comes to a rest, for both of us are panting and my own breathing's ragged.</p> <p>"We shouldn't have done that last night", he says, breaking the kiss. He sits beside me. "Let's take a shower."</p> <p>My heart's pounding at the prospect of the hot flowing liquid we both want to wash away with our hands – but I'm still in disbelief. Maybe it's the hot water I want. Maybe it's—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
