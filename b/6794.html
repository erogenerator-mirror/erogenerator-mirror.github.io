She was not sure but she could tell that as she came down from her high, there was a slight change in the sensations she was experiencing. It was only after the second or third orgasm she let her mind slip away. The only sound in the world was the slurping of the hot water, and as it filled up, it hit her in the mouth like a shot of electricity. She had just had her first orgasm with a stranger, and while it wasn't bad in the least, the difference was startling. As she opened her mouth to speak, she was met with the taste of salt on her tongue. She hadn't been aware of it until it hit her in the face, and as she reached her hand up to wipe it away, the first wave of pleasure washed over her. It was so powerful; everything that happened to her before, it had made her feel like a high-energy, high-controlling slut.</p> <p>A few more strokes and she managed to pull her legs up and wrap them around him, as she was still feeling something, so that he could get as deep as he could, and he continued to push in and out of her. When it subsided she felt a bit more energy left in it, and she found herself reaching out, grabbing his shoulders for balance. He pulled out, not yet giving her the release she was searching for. He got up next to her, and with her help leaned over the edge. "If you want to suck me off, you better ask me nicely first, whore. I really would love for you to."</p> <p>She nodded with a smile. Her hands grabbed for a hold of his, and in the moment, she pulled him back, so that he could take her face into a kiss. For almost a minute they kissed, but then he backed off. "OK," was all she could manage; her heart beating so hard under the water. He stepped back, and started to leave. "Why did you stop? It felt so good!" He said as he backed out. "I haven't had an orgasm like that by a guy in a while, and it wouldn't be fair if you got a blowjob every time she came."</p> <p>She looked up at him in shock, and reached for him but he caught her hands in his as he started up the stairs from the shower. She could see the disappointment on his face as he pulled her up and kissed her again. "You're not gonna give me one at the party. You need a lot more, and I can feel it in your pussy and ass. That's how sexy you are, isn't it? And we're in here. I should have come back for you after the show before. Now it's your turn. You have to be the wildest thing that's ever had come out of you. It can't wait."</p> <p>With that, he pulled her up and they kissed again. While she kissed him, she felt him getting a hard-on. She felt a little dizzy and she decided to take a step down in the shower; instead, she took him in her hand and pulled him back into the shower. She ran the water over his body, making sure to rub around his balls and the base of the cock she couldn't touch. He seemed so hot. She felt her vagina tingle, and as she did so he stepped up out of the showers. It was still so humiliating, being with someone who looked so hot. She stepped back, and stepped up to him, letting his cock rest on the tip of his cock. She grabbed his cock and put it against her vagina lips, and his cock slid in all the way to the hilt. "God!" she thought. They kissed again, and then he turned her around to face the wall and he put his cock back into her mouth. He picked up speed, not letting it last too long, and when he was about to come, he pulled out and pulled her by the hair back into the bathroom. "You ready?," he said as he turned her around, and bent her over the sink. "Lick my balls until I tell you and then you need fucked in the ass!" she said breathlessly.</p> <p>His large cock was about to enter her ass when he stopped, and instead turned around into the bathroom. "Hang on to the sink, bitch," he told her as he put the head of his cock against her anus.</p> <p>"Fuck," she whimpered as she felt him push, but once she had her asshole open and there was his cock, he pushed in slowly. He was huge, and he took time to get it in before he stopped. He went faster and faster into her, and as he was feeling it coming on more and more she was losing the fight for control. She wanted to come harder than the first time her asshole had been invaded.
