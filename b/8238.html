I was on all-fours on the bed, the dress had pushed my cock up against my lower belly, and the whole situation had made me hot. Taking a deep breath, I looked down to see my semi-erect cock standing at attention from the pleasure my legs had caused. A smile spread on my face as I noticed how small my cock was. Taking a deep breath, I ran my hands over the ridges of my cock, starting at the base where it curved up out of the thick head. Turning back up to my feet, I smiled as I ran a hand through my long, dark hair before pulling my head back away from my own cock. Looking down, I couldn't resist leaning back and feeling my hard cock press in between my ass cheeks as my hands continued to explore my body. When I took my hands off of my cock, the soft glow of my own wetness slowly seeped back into my head and brought a smile to my face.</p> <p>Stroking my cock, I watched my hand working my swollen dick, making it twitch under my fingers. I could definitely feel that it wasn't going to get up anytime soon.</p> <p>Grabbing the top of my dress with both hands, I dragged it down my legs and off leaving me naked, my chest heaving with excitement and blood, and my hard cock standing straight up, eager for some action.</p> <p>Looking over at the dresser, I was suddenly thankful I had brought my own shoes. I really didn't need much more than a pair of shoes today. I leaned back slightly, allowing myself to look over at my bed and see my cock at attention.</p> <p>"Holy hell that felt good!" I whispered to myself. Sitting up, I pulled the dress shirt off of my body and threw it on the bed before tossing the dress off onto the floor at the foot of the bed. Pulling on my socks, I slowly pulled the shirt off over my head, tossing it to the floor with my dress shirt. Once the socks I pulled off, I leaned over, pulling the sweatpants off and tossing them off too.</p> <p>Getting into the bed, I lay facing away from the view of the mirror, my cock hanging down between my legs, my hand stroking it up and down slowly, letting my hand play up and down my cock, the pleasure getting greater and more concentrated with each stroke.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, I closed my eyes and focused my mind on my hand on my cock. A soft moan escaped my lips at a particularly slow pace. My mind swirled around in the excitement building within me, I pushed my hips into my hand as my mind drifted back to that first night I came home, that day he had made me cum. He'd said if I were still horny when he took me to bed, I'd let him fuck me, I'd let him fuck me.</p> <p>The desire to finally feel that thick cock inside me, stretching me out, pounding into me, filling me with so much pleasure and sensation, was overwhelming. With a moan, I started to slow down and put a stop to my hand. Rolling onto my back, I let my mind clear and the feeling of a dream fade into a warm, euphoric feeling.</p> <p>My hands continued to touch my cock as my body slowly got used to the feeling. I felt myself starting to get hard as my hands ran over the skin of my stomach. I pushed my pelvis up into my hand, pushing my cock further into my body. In the dream I knew I wouldn't last long. If I played my hand, I'd have cum.</p> <p>Feeling the tension slowly ease from me, I pulled my hands away and looked up at my cock, my cock now standing straight up. My right hand continued to stroke slowly, letting the feelings of pleasure build.</p> <p>"Fucking incredible," I whispered between moans.</p> <p>Sighing to myself, I laid back against the pillows and let my mind wander off to the future. Feeling my cock harden up as it continued to work my mind with my dreams, I opened my eyes to see myself in a mirror as I started to feel the beginnings of orgasm.</p> <p>Slipping off of the bed, I pulled the pillow from under me, and then lay back down, feeling my cock still hard. Looking over at the mirror on the opposite wall, I smiled to myself as I watched myself cumming. I opened my eyes to see my cock still rock hard, the cum running down my dick. Slipping my hand over it, I began to stroke my cock again, feeling as if it might explode. As I neared orgasm, I was starting to think about how my dreams brought me to this, and I stopped stroking, making myself stop. The dream seemed so strong, I wasnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
