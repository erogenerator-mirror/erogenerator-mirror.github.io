I don't really want to be so forward with you.</p> <p>"Noooo, you're not... you're going to strip for us now."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Absolutely. Don't be shy."</p> <p>She put on the light blouse that she had on. It had been worn before with some of the clothes she had just put on. Now she was wearing only the new ones that she knew she would like to keep. It was a nice outfit really, and she liked the way it made her breasts swell. She put on a black-bra that made her nipples stand out. She had her long legs tightly encased in a very short skirt. She was going to try a new kind of panties tonight, which would help her to get the maximum exposure out of them by letting her thighs go a little wider.</p> <p>"I'll be right back." she said, and headed down to the bathroom to change.</p> <p>She got into her car and started driving the short, tight skirt up and over her hips. The top part fell down on her breasts. She thought it looked great and she loved how it looked on her. Then she saw a light, and drove the car into the driveway of the house.</p> <p>She looked out the front window and saw her car. "Shit. Not going to stop here, are you?" she thought to herself. Then she was surprised when she saw a girl's house across the street.</p> <p>She pulled into the driveway at a quarter to three and saw a yellow Toyota, with a white pick up pulling in the driveway. It was the same Toyota she had seen on the street earlier this week, but as she pulled up, it looked different. It's was the same yellow Toyota of the same color? She pulled into the garage where the master bathroom was. It looked a little different from the master bedroom, she thought. She saw the kitchen and the dining room, and wondered how her son got in here early because she went to see him. Then she saw her house, a few doors down from hers, and wondered how could anyone see into her own house like this.</p> <p>"Hey, Mom?" she heard from her son's side of the house. She looked in to see him standing there in an old- fashioned T-shirt stretched out before her. The shirt was worn and it looked very wrinkled from the days spent outside.</p> <p>"Hi, honey."</p> <p>She smiled at him, standing up so they could hug.</p> <p>"Hey, Mom."</p> <p>"Hey, handsome."</p> <p>"So do you mind if we stay in for a while? I want to look at some of those toys that my mother and I have."</p> <p>"I would love that." she thought, and she couldn't think of anything she wanted more right now.</p> <p>They hugged for a long time, but then she saw her brother. He was walking up the steps to the kitchen and she was thinking how great he looked in his uniform. He was a little shorter than his father, and he was also a little larger.</p> <p>They hugged each other briefly and then parted ways. She didn't see her brother come in.</p> <p>She was looking at the old television screen. She didn't understand why she and her boyfriend hadn't brought it along. When he stood up and put his arms around her, she looked out the screen and saw that she and her mother had the tape in their little hands.</p> <p>He kissed her right on the mouth and she thought, "Holy fuck that's hot!" But then it was gone and they both saw the house lights go on.</p> <p>She turned around and he was holding her and they locked lips. She felt his hands around her and she kissed him back. She realized her tongue was touching his as he continued to kiss her. It felt great and she felt so loved.</p> <p>Then the door closed and he pulled away.</p> <p>She thought, "Now that is hot."</p> <p>"Mom."</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"Now that you are in my boyhood, I want to take some pictures of you like that. I want to see how pretty you are."</p> <p>She thought, "Oh, but I don't feel so pretty right now, I'm just so happy right now."</p> <p>Then it was on his desk.</p> <p>"Mom, why didn't I bring this to you?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry honey. I was just so excited. The pictures. And I wanted to send them back."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Really," she said softly.</p> <p>He gave her a kiss before he went back to his room. Then she turned and watchedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
