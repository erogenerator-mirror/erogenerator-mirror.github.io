Now try out each one," he coaxed.</p> <p>He had moved around to look at mine and when he did, his expression didn't change. I just stood there, smiling but also unsure of what to do. He moved into me again and hugged me. His fingers were playing on my chest again and I was getting more nervous. "I love you, Sarah," he said.</p> <p>When I looked right in those beautiful eyes, I realized he had the same idea he did about me being nervous. "I love you, too."</p> <p>"Is that what you want?" he asked me.</p> <p>I nodded. "Yes." He pulled me close again and I felt the kiss deepen, then the feeling dissipated. I closed my eyes and leaned forward, our lips touching and we kissed softly for a minute. I looked at him through my lashes and thought of the next kiss. He kissed my face and neck as his fingers wandered into my hair. I felt like an angel, standing there, watching. Our kiss deepened. I felt as though my soul had surrendered to him, but it had a different meaning. When he felt the tingling again at the base of my spine, he leaned forward and kissed the top left edge of my cheek, then the bottom right, across my jaw, then down the middle of my face. His lips brushed across my lips, then I opened my eyes, but it was not a full open kiss. Instead his lips moved down and he kissed the top of my left ear then the other. His lips were so light around me that it felt like his lips and tongue had done a long distance.</p> <p>I could feel the heat from his lips on my cheeks and cheek. I knew he was looking into my eyes for any reaction he might give me. They were a little cloudy, however, when he moved his mouth to my ear and blew a sighy breath that sent a tingle down the length of my neck and into my breast-bone. It was something that didn't bother me, but I felt it. Like I was in some kind of magical trance. We were both staring into each other's eyes, searching each other out for answers to the same question.</p> <p>After a minute, he drew back and gazed into my eyes as he pulled off my shirt and then reached behind my back to unsnap the bra. I gasped as he pulled it off, then pushed it off with his other hand as he looked at me. I felt so naked! His hands found my breasts and he cupped them, lifting them, squeezing them, teasing the nipples. I was lost in ecstasy, in the moment, letting his hands take away all the cares of the world and just enjoy the feeling.</p> <p>My head was back, my eyes closed as he moved down me to my belly and bellybutton. Once again I felt a rush of arousal at the thought of his mouth on my skin. His soft lips brushed along my hips and I felt a surge of electricity run up to my head. His tongue swirled down my asscrack and he tickled the bottom of my crease. My breath was coming in gasps and the feeling was like a rush of pure pleasure. He seemed to know exactly what to do, as if he had never done anything like this before. His tongue teased the sensitive skin just inside my hole and it drove me wild. His fingertips slid into me with surprising ease.</p> <p>And then his hands were caressing my thighs, his fingers sliding up, across my ass, then pushing in between my cheeks. He kept his hands there for a minute, pressing a finger into my ass and spreading my juices over my hole. I didn't know what had come over me, but I was already feeling pleasure that I wasn't expecting. He was looking over my body at me as his tongue continued to explore, making love to my body. I couldn't take it any more and I reached for him, taking his hand to move him to my side, then up under my arms to feel the rest of him. His hands were warm on my chest as he pulled the shirt off.</p> <p>His lips touched my skin, then he took off his own shirt. I could barely move as his arms wrapped up around me against the side of the tub. As the water cascaded down our bodies, I moaned with pleasure. My legs were like liquid silk underneath my feet as he cupped my breast in his hand. As his lips found mine again, I could feel his erection, hot and rigid under the pressure, pressing against me with his other hand. They were on fire when we kissed and it drove me wild. He ran his hands up and down my body as he kissed me.
