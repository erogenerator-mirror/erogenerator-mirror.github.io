He was right. It was.</p> <p>"You didn't, and I didn't," I stuttered, "And you just stopped doing this."</p> <p>My voice was soft, pleading. He was right. I knew it. I shouldn't really stop doing this, but he wanted me to. My heart raced. This was too much for me. I wasn't sure that I should do it again, but I couldn't help myself. Not without him. That had been a part of it, but it was no longer a part of this experience. I had to give myself over to him again, to let go. Please.</p> <p>"I don't think I can," I said. "Please, Chris, just give it a chance."</p> <p>"I don't think I can either, MaryAnne," he whispered seriously. "But I will." And he started moving his body to take me back, and soon he was completely inside me with one rough deep move. We both groaned together, and he started making his body thrusting again, again and again. We could both feel the heat of our coupling, the tension of our bodies, the intense tension. It was so intense, I thought I was going to pass out. He was moving even faster, deeper, more forceful than before, his body slamming into mine, the head of his penis rubbing the sensitive tissues of my cervix.</p> <p>I couldn't believe the strength of his motions now. I wasn't about to stop. I had no control, none whatsoever. But I couldn't break free, nor stop him, not for him. So I just took it and let him take it, just in that moment.</p> <p>As he began his body thrusts in earnest, almost violently in my position, I felt myself being torn apart between two different forces inside me. The warmth of him, the warmth of our skin joining as the union of raw flesh. I couldn't tell, and didn't know that I could make myself stop, if I would be able to. In between he was driving me to climax again and again as I held on to him tightly. As I reached my peak again, I pulled him to me, and held him tightly still while he exploded into me.</p> <p>We lay there entwined for long minutes with me still on him, him inside me, while a flood of our mixed fluids ran down my thigh, through our bodies, and onto my clothes.</p> <p>I finally broke the embrace we were still sharing, "Chris, if this is what you have been wanting...just know that we will not be together forever."</p> <p>"You're right, MaryAnne," he said. "I will always be MaryAnne, but it won't bother me, so long as we love her, respect each other."</p> <p>"If that's what you want?" I asked him. I was beginning to understand.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, MaryAnne," he said. "It took me so long to find out. And that's what we are, MaryAnne. If you don't love me, then you're not worthy. And if it's something you're not willing to share with me, don't worry about it. I'll just wait and see whether that's who you really are. All that matters is that we love each other. I'm here, so to speak."</p> <p>"You have really given me a lot to think about, Chris," I replied, still with tears in my eyes. "And I still have this thing where I'm afraid I'll lose you when I get to college."</p> <p>"I love you, MaryAnne," he said, smiling. "And I know that it's not right to lose you, but I will never do anything to hurt you."</p> <p>"I won't," I said. "I wouldn't even let you do it to me."</p> <p>"That will never change," he said. If he kept doing that, I would never forgive him. And he would never stop being so kind, so kind. "It's okay," he reassured me. "It's your decision. I love you, and I think, it's okay that you're afraid. I won't stop now, not without going through with it. But I will do my best to stay still, if we need to...try to be together."</p> <p>He pulled me over him again, and held me closely as we cuddled in that moment. I wanted to tell him he was right about what he had already seen in me, but knew I might be too stupid to think much of anything now. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt him. It seemed so stupid, so stupid, and then I realized that it was a foolish thing to think about. Besides, I didn't really love him. I truly loved him. I really lovedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
