But you know that my pussy is so sore right now, that it hurts."</p> <p>"Well, you could have told me how long it takes to come again, you know."</p> <p>"Of course, I know. It wasn't easy to do."</p> <p>"No, it's not. I only came once, not many. But that was the best sex I've had in a long time. I've still never had an orgasm like that with anyone. That first guy, I really liked, really got into it and that was the best sex I've had in a long time. It was fun but it was the best sex a woman can ever have with another woman, at least before. And, I don't ever want to do it again.</p> <p>"I know you know. You just kept telling me that it was the best sex I've had in a very long time. I'm glad you told me that. No one who has done that before must ever have done anything that good before. It's too early to find out. But I know, I want to. I really do. And all I've done is fantasize about it."</p> <p>"Don't you want to hear this now?" he asked.</p> <p>"I think I should," I said.</p> <p>"OK, I'll bet you want me to bring you another beer sometime. OK.</p> <p>I was happy, and felt happy, and even a little nervous as we had another little one-year affair that would be one of the most enjoyable experiences in my life. I was still in the middle of it.</p> <p>But, the one thing that was missing was someone. One man.</p> <p>I told her all of this in a very quiet and very matter-of-fact way. Because the truth was that I really didn't want that to happen, I thought; that maybe the sex would get stale at any time.</p> <p>I said this. Then I said, "You just keep trying to get around to what I feel, that you might never get it. I know that there will be a day when I'll really not want to be married to you, when I'll want to be with you, and will hate you for doing that all the time."</p> <p>"So, what do you want to do, do you?" I asked as I looked at her again.</p> <p>"What do I want to do?" she said.</p> <p>"I want to make love to you," I said.</p> <p>She grinned and put her arm around me and hugged me tightly. "I guess we could do that," she said.</p> <p>I was glad we were together again, because that was the only other possible way.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she said, sounding more confident.</p> <p>I held her and kissed her, and then asked, "How long will it take you to do it?"</p> <p>"Well, I have no idea. I'm just ready for it now," she said.</p> <p>"Really," I said. "Can it wait for awhile."</p> <p>"No, that's not what I mean. I want you to do it with me."</p> <p>I really thought, "I guess," she might be scared, or that the sex might be getting too much for her.</p> <p>"There is one other thing," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, no. Let's not talk about that," she said.</p> <p>"I promise I won't tell anyone," I assured her.</p> <p>She laughed and said, "We'll think of a way to pay for that, ok? And I'm sure we'll find something else to do."</p> <p>"I'll think of something to do. Now I want to go shower," I said.</p> <p>"Wait a minute, are you sure you can do it?" she said with a little smile on her face.</p> <p>I wasn't sure, but she looked back at me. "I want to, yes, I want to do it now. That's good!"</p> <p>"OK, OK," I said.</p> <p>When I walked back into the bedroom she said, "I'll be right back."</p> <p>She had laid out a little dress on the bed. The dress was thin but black, and really showed off her skin. It stopped just below her breasts and was slit to her hip, showing very little below the curve of her ass. The top of her slit went up so the top of the hip was at mid-thigh.</p> <p>When she came back I was ready for her. She had slipped on a pair of black lacy panties and a black lacy bra. Again, her boobs were smaller than I thought.
