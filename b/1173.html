You look fantastic in your black heels. Are the heels heels you were wearing today sexy?"</p> <p>"Yes I am sexy."</p> <p>"You sure are an amazing person." He paused for a second while we finished our coffee." I have never been so flattered." I turned to him with a seductive smile.</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed me on the lips just once more before he said as he leaned over to his desk. "I have been thinking of you for ages and I wanted to look at you again before I make love to you."</p> <p>I looked at him again and said with a smile. "We are in for a long night." He leaned forward, slid his hands inside my jacket and gently rubbed my breasts through my blouse. I felt him slide his fingers under the fabric and under my bra, my nipples hardened. His fingers were now stroking my breasts firmly and slowly as I felt his fingers trace a line along my chest just before they came to rest at the edge of my bra. He pulled the fabric away and said as he looked me in the eye. "You have the cutest little nipples for a sexy woman."</p> <p>I smiled devilishly as I stood up and opened the front of my jacket to reveal my breasts. I could feel the cold of the rain falling on the fabric and felt like his fingers were sliding on my skin. He stood up and helped me lift my skirt over my hips.</p> <p>"Oh God, what have I done!" I stammered before I dropped my skirt down to my feet and stepped out of my shoes. It was the first time I was in close to a car and I wanted to feel his hands on me and make love to me again. I felt both scared and excited as he stood up and undid his pants pulling his cock out in the light light. My body was trembling and my nipples were hard and standing out against the fabric. I quickly dropped my skirt in the front and opened my hoodie front letting my hard nipples drag along the material as I slid it down over my arms and over my head. I dropped it to the floor and he stepped back.</p> <p>"I could take it for quite a walk and get you as wet as I do," he said as he picked up his clothes from the floor. I watched as he stood there, his cock half erect and he watched my reaction as I slowly took it in my hand and slowly stroked it. He stepped back out of my sight and turned to face me again. I ran my hand along his cock and then slid it up toward my mouth again. His head was slightly down and I could smell his cologne before it disappeared in my hair as I ran my tongue around his head. I gently took him in my mouth as I continued to stroke him watching it disappear into my mouth, then disappear again. I could actually hear the water hit the windshield as I sucked him gently, then more aggressively as I slid his cock all the way down to the base.</p> <p>I watched his face as I sucked him slowly and I could tell that he was enjoying it. We had been in the car for 20 minutes or so, when he started to gently run his hands through my hair, pulling my head closer still each time he thrust his cock into my mouth. I was becoming more turned on by the minute and he began to thrust his cock deeper into my mouth until he hit the back of my throat. His cum ran down my throat as I continued to suck on his cock. I could feel his body shaking slightly as he began to cum in my mouth. I sucked hard and let the head of his cock slide out of my mouth. He groaned softly as my tongue ran along the shaft while I milked his cock gently until the last of his cum escaped from the eye. He held his cock in my mouth for at least a few more seconds before backing away looking at me.</p> <p>We walked back to our car laughing. When he was finally out of the parking lot he turned and looked over at me. I pulled my hoodie over my head and ran my fingers under the fabric. I had not thought to put my black heels on today but this skirt felt so damn naughty and the shoes felt so feminine against my skin. I bent down and grabbed my skirt and pulled it over my waist. As I turned around I took his hand and walked him to the elevator. He had not even gone far before the door opened. I walked over to the door and turned around.</p> <p>"You're an amazing girl." He said as he watched me disappear into the doorway. I felt a rush of excitement at knowing that he just watched me walk home and feel more sexy by the second.</p> <p>The car ride to my place was the most sexually charged day of my life. We were both naked and had no more than about 10 to 15 minutes to really get to know each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
