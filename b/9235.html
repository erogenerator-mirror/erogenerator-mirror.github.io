I've told you once how much I envy you."</p> <p>"Yes." I sighed.</p> <p>"If you can get off without making a mess," she leaned over and gave me a deep kiss, "we've evened out the sex for now." She turned back to the monitor and started playing with her cock again. It didn't take long before she started to come.</p> <p>"Oh God, I can't keep doing this forever." I pushed her back into the bed, laid in next to her. "You said you wanted to fuck him, why won't you do it?"</p> <p>"I have wanted to make it a quickie once, but I've been so wrapped up, I don't even want to think about it," she laughed, "I'm glad he's already here."</p> <p>"You're such a beautiful whore," I kissed her, "I can't wait to watch you as you're getting her off."</p> <p>"It's already been so hot, I'm actually glad to finish, the second you're here is going to be too much for me."</p> <p>"I can tell." She started to slide onto me. "Can you?"</p> <p>"I think I'm too far gone to even be able to do that." I gave her a look. "If we're going to do this, you need to come."</p> <p>"Oh you're going to have to go. You promised you would make it up to me."</p> <p>I thought she meant it; I nodded slowly, "What about when you're here?"</p> <p>"I want it too, now. Let's get in the mood."</p> <p>I had never gotten that worked up before. We went into the bedroom, and when we got back, she was already stripping naked. I got undressed, and got on the bed. She got in, and we kissed again as I slid my way into her wetness. It was only a moment before she was kissing me and grinding against me. She started to come again, and a moment later, I had come again, followed by a very hard climax. We were both exhausted by that time, and she lay in my arms, breathing so heavily. I fell asleep in her arms, and when I woke up the next morning, I was still spooned with her. I couldn't recall any of the things we'd said the night before, but I did know our lovemaking had not been nearly like that either. If we were going to make it past the weekend, we'd need to be careful. I had to get some sleep; I could barely move all weekend. I got a call at noon the next day. I had no idea what it was, but I had been hoping there was some reason it hadn't been more like that.</p> <p>"What are you doing this weekend?"</p> <p>"I didn't want to, but he was going to have this discussion over lunch."</p> <p>"Oh, so it's his turn now."</p> <p>"No, it's not," she was still breathing hard, "but I'm tired too." I smiled, and pulled the sheet over us. "Besides," I whispered when I drifted off, "he's probably right about you being more than just a good fuck for him. Why couldn't you just give up, you know."</p> <p>"You are such a dirty girl. I'm going to love it just the same." We lay together, spooning back into each other, breathing hard.</p> <p>"I'm going to make an executive decision today. In the morning." Her breathing began to slow, as she reached down and touched my already hard cock. "I want to come."</p> <p>"Me too." I kissed her shoulder.</p> <p>"Can I just say I was looking forward to something special today?" She didn't answer. I could tell that she was thinking about the upcoming weekend and what had happened last night. I rolled her over and began to thrust into her with the same strokes I had with her the night before. She began to moan louder and louder, and her hips rose to meet mine. I couldn't last as long as I wanted to. We could have finished at any minute now.</p> <p>"I'm going to get so damn hot." She reached beneath me, and guided my shaft up toward her opening.</p> <p>"Get that idea. I'm going to make you cum, too." I wasn't getting hard just yet. All I could think about was watching her face as she came. Her eyes were closed, and her mouth was open, she was moaning and tossing her hips. I pushed my shaft inside her, and she lifted her hips so she could meet mine. A moment later, she climaxed againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
