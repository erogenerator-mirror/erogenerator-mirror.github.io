Again, her legs opened. Her body felt warm and alive.</p> <p>I slid back into her, and slid my hands around to her sides, and gently squeezed her breasts. She groaned as I cupped them in my hands, and my lips moved down her stomach.</p> <p>I kissed her belly button, slowly, and her body stiffened. Her legs parted slowly, and I slid my arms under her legs. I knelt between them, and slid my hand up her thigh, and over her pussy. Her lips were swollen and warm and moist. She reached down and slid her hands over my head, and pulled me to her. I slid my tongue out. She tasted like strawberries. I wanted to get my tongue deep inside her pussy. I slid my tongue down her body, slowly. She moaned and pushed her legs open. I slid my tongue around her clit. Her hips rocked up, and I pulled my mouth away. I kissed it gently. I slid my tongue slowly back down across her pussy. I slid it over her asshole. She tensed, and pulled against the sheets. My tongue slid back to her clit as her hips began to buck.</p> <p>She groaned as my tongue slid back to it. I slid my tongue back up her body, and slid it back down her body, sliding slowly down her stomach while my hand slid down between her legs. The taste of her juices was divine. I sucked her clit into my mouth, and heard her catch her breath. I slid my fingers deep inside her pussy, and finger-fucked her with purpose.</p> <p>Her breath caught in her throat as she felt my fingers moving around her pussy. I slid two fingers between her lips, and stroked her g-spot while I sucked on her clit. Her hips rose up on their own as I slid two fingers slowly in and out of her. My lips and tongue sucked on her clit, and slid my fingers into her.</p> <p>She tensed against the bed as my finger and tongue got faster and deeper. I slid a third finger into her as her hips pumped her hips up against it. She came hard as her hips bucked against my hand. I felt a spasm hit my arm, and it sent me over the edge. My hand spasm, making her moan as loudly as I thrust into her. We both shuddered as our bodies convulsed against each other's, and we gasped for air.</p> <p>I rolled off her, and lay on my back. I turned towards her, and slowly slid my fingers out of her. The next thing I knew, she was lying next to me, with an arm over my chest and the sheets thrown over us. We both smiled as I slid my fingers out of her.</p> <p>Her hand touched the head of my cock. She stroked it, looking at me. I leaned to her and kissed her. We stayed there, kissing. I felt her hand stroking the tip of my cock with her fingertips. She slid her fingertips down my shaft, and touched my cockhead. She rubbed it against her thumb, and watched me as she slid it down and around the head of my cock. She wrapped her fingers around it, and slowly squeezed it.</p> <p>"Do you think that you can't fuck me again anytime soon?" She murmured as she stared into my eyes. "I just want to be with you every day. I want to be with you every night. You are the only one I want, and I'm so happy." She smiled, and slid her hands down my chest, down to my cock, and stroked the underside with her thumbs.</p> <p>"Can I ask you something?" She looked at me for a long time.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"How would you feel if we had sex now and then?" I asked her softly.</p> <p>She stared at me, so intently that I could barely understand how this was going to effect her.</p> <p>"How?" She asked.</p> <p>"I could tell you. If I could. You would like it. Not just me. But me. And you could tell me everything. Nothing has changed between us... in time." I said, and waited for her answer.</p> <p>"What? What would you like me to do?" My finger trailed between her parted lips, to her stomach. Her eyes widened when her hand slid up and touched my cock, and she smiled. She wanted to know everything. We could talk like this in front of one other person, but not right in front of me.</p> <p>"Mmm, you know... if you were with me right now... I would want to do everything." She smiled, and opened her mouth. I held her eyes as she brought it close to mine.
