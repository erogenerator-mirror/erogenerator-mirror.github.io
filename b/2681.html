I sighed, and I reached out to hold his face in my hands.</p> <p>"Dana Lee, I-"</p> <p>"Just give me a little privacy!" I snapped, reaching up to wrap my arms around his neck and pull him down for a passionate kiss.</p> <p>The kiss wasn't a frantic one, neither was it long, and as we parted, he was still holding my hand in his.</p> <p>When we parted, he was still breathing heavily.</p> <p>"Why..." I said, pulling back so as not to shatter the mood. "Why did you do it?"</p> <p>"Because I want you!" he said, finally sitting up in the bed, his face still stained with a mix of tears he didn't even realize he had shed.</p> <p>"I guess I need some distance," he said, and I could see his shoulders visibly relax.</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe you do."</p> <p>"Dana Lee, what are you saying?"</p> <p>"What do you think I want you to do??" She asked, not sounding as if she was kidding.</p> <p>Before I could answer, the door to the closet slammed open, and he quickly moved to his own bed, scrambling to cover himself.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I asked quietly, my voice a little quivering. "Something's wrong with him. You can feel it, but that feeling is so intense right now, it's scary."</p> <p>She was looking at me, a frown on her face that caused me to smile. She was dressed only slightly more modestly, her black dress, which the dressmaker had left on a hanger and her black, thigh-high boots, looking even more amazing in the pale light. She was still sitting beside me, her knee leaning against the wall and looking straight at me. Her hand rested on my arm like it had before, and I felt that tugging of regret for her as well.</p> <p>"He's in a bad state," she said, her hand coming to rest on my thigh, a look of sympathy on her face.</p> <p>"Is that bad?" I asked, trying to maintain the conversation between us.</p> <p>"It seems like everything is going according to his plan," she sighed, looking down at the floor.</p> <p>I knew she thought it was hopeless, that we had only come close to making love, and that we had only spent a short time with each of us because it seemed so easy, but I could see how she and the others could have been much different than the way they were. We had not had an actual relationship after what happened on the boat, and it seemed that was a huge improvement.</p> <p>But the thought of that night in the river made me think about Dana Lee all over again.</p> <p>I was surprised when she leaned over and kissed me. She felt warm, just the way I knew her would feel. She pulled back and looked at me.</p> <p>"Was that as good as it is for you, too?"</p> <p>"I hope so," I said. "We can still have a relationship. What if that goes somewhere? What if..."</p> <p>"No, we'll come to that, maybe!" she said. "It was so hard to say no. And then..."</p> <p>And that was it. I realized how much this was going to cost me, and how much I wanted to know what it felt like to finally have a relationship with my ex-wife.</p> <p>"I want to be with you, Dana Lee. You know I'd make it on my own, and you..."</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, her head back on her hand, her hands folded into her lap. "And you aren't ready for that either?" she asked quietly.</p> <p>"No, no, no!" I said, trying to be calm and say nothing, but her hands were shaking enough that she was shaking herself like a leaf.</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with that," she said quietly. "I can't say it enough."</p> <p>It seemed like a reasonable enough statement after all.</p> <p>"I was hoping we could...you know, just do something," I said, starting to look hopeful.</p> <p>"I still won't say no," she said softly, looking up at me. "Do you have any idea what you're asking for?"</p> <p>I shook my head.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay with all of this?" I asked her softly.</p> <p>She noddedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
