And we could still play with the toys at the game table. He had been so eager to be with me in the tub before. I could feel him becoming a little more rigid under my ministrations. And now was no different from any time our hands were intertwined, or he had my cock inside of me, or while we watched our friends make out on the bench outside. Sometimes, his eyes would meet mine and I usually smiled. He would smile as we watched and it sent a shiver through me. "Do you really want to?" I asked.</p> <p>"More than anything," he said. I could feel him shifting his hands, so I began to take off my shirt. He began to remove his clothing as well, tossing off his tank as he did so. His body looked so masculine as I slowly undressed him, my hands moving on their own, following their path along his bare skin as my hands crept over his hard muscles. His cock was long and hard, bobbing up and down in the water, a large, dark bead trailing down his left thigh while he leaned back against the wall. His arms dropped down to his side as his hands worked their way up over it, caressing his hands into his hair. He looked so feminine with his long and thick hair, his blue eyes staring up at me, his hair flowing from his hand. For the first time, I felt him looking at me at that moment as he ran my fingertips softly up his neck and jaw, then across to kiss the tip of his chin. "I want to taste you," he said and kissed me with the passion of the first time.</p> <p>"It's still kinda early in the evening, and the sun's setting," I commented, not fully knowing that our lives could turn out even more differently that we thought.</p> <p>"Honey," he said as he stepped back into the tub, "you might want to go back inside before the other guests arrive." He looked at me and kissed me gently on the lips, then turned and kissed me again, then pulled off my shirt and boxers. He moved his face to my neck and shoulder and I could feel how rippled and defined it was through his body. His warm breath and the light scent of the soap were all I could think of. He kissed my inner thigh as he spoke, then moved up to my nipple, his lips and teeth grazing me as he made his trek down to kiss my stomach. He could tell that I was ready, and moved up to take his place in the tub to watch him begin to undress. His eyes were fixated on mine as he pulled my hands down so I could touch him. I took him in my hands as he slowly began to take off his shirt...</p> <p>"So beautiful," he said quietly, then slowly slid his hands down his chest and back up toward my shoulders. He put his hands on my breasts and he began to play with them before he took my hands and moved them down to his cock, and I had a little tremor in my arms as I tried to pull him closer. He put his hands on the sides of my hips and began sliding my body down towards his...</p> <p>"You are so beautiful, Mommy," he said as I felt him slide between the cheeks of my ass as we kissed. His touch was soft, almost loving as it moved over my body. I wrapped my legs and arms around him and I could feel his hips pushing into mine through my legs, and I was starting to push him towards my pussy. "Mmmm, so beautiful." I reached down to pull my panties off, then sat up facing him as I began to rub my hand over his cock, which was growing stiffer with his excitement. He leaned back into the tub with his hands on his head and closed his eyes, the waves gently washing over him from head to shoulder. I could feel how sensitive he was against my finger, and I was able to stroke his erection even as my hand made slow circles over him. He pushed his body away from me then grabbed me and wrapped his arms around me, pulling me towards him for a kiss as I returned the favor. His tongue slid between my lips as my fingers slipped inside his hot box, finding what I was looking for... his cock.</p> <p>I felt his body shift slightly and I knew that it was because of how it felt the first time we made love like this. I loved how his body moved under my touch and I had to admit that I could stay standing in this position for quite a while. His mouth was on mine again, and his hands were everywhere and the feeling of power I was feeling under our bodies as he pulled me towards him, then moved his hips and positioned his cock at the opening to my body. His tongue went to my lips and began to play with them, then slid into my mouth.</p> <p>His lips, tongue, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
