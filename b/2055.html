After a few drinks, we got into the tub and started to get ready to go.</p> <p>"So, I'm a little late getting home," I said, "and to be honest, I really feel like we're in Europe again tonight, if you need me for anything, okay?"</p> <p>"It's nice to see a guy who's not trying to be anything," she replied. "It's nice if we have a couple beers or something before I get in the tub to freshen up. So, what did you have in mind?"</p> <p>"Let's take the bedroom first. That way I have an up close view of some of your tits as you get ready for me," I said with a wicked smile. I then got up, and turned on the bedroom light. I got into bed on my back, with my legs open to him. He crawled up on the bed with me, and moved over close to me.</p> <p>He kissed me on the lips. "I really like how you feel when I suck you. My cock is harder and it still gets hard from seeing your tits. It's so sexy getting to see them, and thinking about you. Maybe it's time we could get a little more comfortable a little more tonight. That sounds like something you'd like," he said with a wicked smile.</p> <p>I looked around the room. The bed looked big enough. I thought about it for a moment and agreed that it was nice that we were alone that night. He climbed on the bed, and moved over to the left side of me. I was laying half on my side, facing the ceiling, and half sitting up. He slowly stroked his cock, teasing me and making me want what I thought he wanted. I was enjoying it and needed him to feel me against him. He rolled back ontop of me and got his cock between my legs. He took his cock in his right hand, and rubbed it against my pussy. The head popped in as the wetness from my pussy lips started to flow. He pushed the head in, and all the way in.</p> <p>He took his hand away from me, and pulled his cock out of me slowly. I could now feel his cock hard. He put his cock in his right hand, and rubbed it back and forth across my clit, while he pulled on his cock. He slid it in and out a few times, while looking over his shoulder at me.</p> <p>"I like the way you think about my cock," he said. "Especially the way you're sitting up," I replied with a smile.</p> <p>"I love it so much," I replied. "It feels so good when you slide all the way in, when you just hold onto it, and don't move," I continued as he put the head just outside of me, and began to stroke it in and out. He had his other hand out of the water and slowly was rubbing some of the soap over his cock as he worked on me. The head was sliding up and down her wet slit. I turned and pulled his arm back, while I was pulling on my own nipple. He watched closely as I had his head out of the water and it was his cock sliding up and down my body.</p> <p>He had his hands on the bed, playing with my breasts. They were so hard and full. He rubbed his cock harder and faster over my pussy. I felt so full. He felt so good inside of me. I could feel his cock getting even larger, which felt good. I wanted him to fuck me, and he knew I liked that.</p> <p>It didn't take long for the orgasm that came to me, to make my body thrashing and his cock pounding all the way to completion. He shot load after load into my body, and we both collapsed on the bed. He was panting for the moment. He held onto me as we sat there, in the water. I leaned over to kiss him, and could taste his lips and tongue, which was now hardening even more with his own cum and my juices. He kissed me back, and I pulled him close. We embraced as I slid one arm under his back, while I wrapped my arm around him.</p> <p>He took his hand off my breast, and I did the same. He ran it down my stomach, and then back up my body. He gently ran his finger over my pussy lips. He slowly slid it right into my cunt, and began rubbing my clit gently. I reached between his legs and caressed his balls. They were hard as well, as were his cock. I could see a drop from his cock on my breast, and it looked different than a normal cock. He moved his hand to my pussy again, as he got the head outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
