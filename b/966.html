No problem. When was the last time you got pounded by an old fart?"</p> <p>She looked at me and smiled, but the expression on her face made it clear she was confused.</p> <p>"I don't suppose... Well maybe another day," I responded. "It's been almost a whole week since you have been, um... you know... "</p> <p>"You mean been with a guy before?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah... But a guy doesn't get to... it just happens," I explained.</p> <p>"Maybe not that, but it could be. Maybe it was after a fight or something..."</p> <p>"No... maybe..." I said, smiling at her discomfort. "Just think of all the people you could have been with... The old guys, the girls, all the girls."</p> <p>"Are you kidding? Of all the girls I could have be with?" Sarah's eyes got a funny expression. "The night of the Prom or whatever it is?"</p> <p>"Yeah... not really." I hesitated, knowing I should answer her, but then thought better.</p> <p>"Well one thing though, is you know, if you guys had a fight with him or something, maybe he..." I trailed off.</p> <p>"I know that," she said. "Maybe... No it's not like that... but... you guys... never mind, I'm going home," she said as she got up from the table.</p> <p>"I think we all need a shower," Sarah said. "You going back to work?" "Yeah, maybe later," I said. "Let's finish this in my office?"</p> <p>"Maybe... I'll be right over to the office though," she answered.</p> <p>We both stood up, leaving the rest of the dishes on the kitchen counter. Sarah led me by the hand through her door, and she closed the door behind us. The steam filled the room, with the smell of freshly applied soap. She led me up the stairs to the bathroom, where I started the water running, while I grabbed a towel and began to dry her off carefully. Once she was dry, I stood back from her, letting her see the results of the water, which just looked like a little bubble bath. I held out my hand, and she took it and we stepped in, holding hands.</p> <p>We went through so much water, we stopped just before we went to her bedroom, dried, and then put on robes that I had left on the back of the door. She laid down on her stomach, and I crawled in next to her, spooning her. She lifted her butt and pressed her tits up into my chest.</p> <p>"I need to tell you more about myself," she explained. "Last week, you got in trouble with a cop, I know. Turns out, he got a call at the gym late last night, and you had a fight with him, a fight that he has done often before, and I've really got to tell you that all the time."</p> <p>"It's alright," I said, kissing her soft cheek. With that, she wrapped her arms around my neck and held me tight. We relaxed for a minute, enjoying the feeling of a warm, wet body pressed into me. I looked over and saw Sarah looking at me curiously.</p> <p>"You look a little bit sheepish there," she said, and giggled.</p> <p>"It's just... it's hard to hide it," I said, giving her a quick kiss on the lips.</p> <p>"What," she asked in surprise.</p> <p>"I'm trying to get into your pants, and I'm just about naked..." I said, referring to the fact that she is wearing black shorts that fit tight, but I'm a big guy and you know a long ways to take them off..."</p> <p>"You want to?" she asked, eyes wide.</p> <p>"Yeah, and I don't just mean when... Well, not at first, until I got dressed up. Oh, it's not easy, but you know I'll take a shower and I'll never... I really hate to be such a mess. But just relax and just lay there and just enjoy it."</p> <p>"I'm here," she said, rubbing her hands down my chest, taking my cock into a slow lazy motion. She pressed it against her pussy, just barely parting her pussy lips.</p> <p>"So what do you think," she asked tentatively.</p> <p>"I think you should take off your clothes," I said.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yeah.
