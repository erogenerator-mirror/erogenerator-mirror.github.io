I pulled into an empty garage parking lot behind the truck parked next to my house, and leaned next to the door. As the door closed, I was greeted by the vision of Karen: She was dressed in a black camisole, sheer hose, and black satin slip-ons and heels. Her bare feet were bare except for the heels, and her legs and feet were bare, except the slip beneath them. The camisole was low cut, exposing her soft, flat stomach. Her breasts were small, but still firm and perky in the bra I bought her as a new pair, and they were perfectly rounded and pointed. The slip she wore underneath was tight and high, with no bra; her nipples stood out, hard as tiny pebbles. She was walking in bare feet, and those high heels, made her legs look longer but shorter, than they'd been, at just under five inches. She had the look of a slinky young model, not the professional beauty of the lingerie I'd put her to wear for her interview; the confident woman that I'd put her to wear this afternoon.</p> <p>'She is so very pretty,' I thought. I looked at the back of her and I knew I'd had a good look. She had this really sexy ass. That gorgeous. It had to be a 38c; I knew it would fit, but it was not the real thing; it was a little bit too big for her, but that wasn't my problem. It had to be the right size for Karen. I felt my cock twitching, standing stiff. My cock was hard and throbbing in my pants. I looked, and saw that her eyes were closed and her chest rising and falling fast. I couldn't believe it, but her mouth was open. Her breath was coming in short gasps, I could hear it in her throat. God, she was going to make me cum.</p> <p>"Come with me, baby," I said softly. I took her hand and led her into the kitchen table where I placed an arm length mirror across the table opposite her.</p> <p>"I know it's bad now, we had a little talk. But don't worry," I said, "I won't tell if you don't want it to be. Just trust me." She smiled up at me, and her eyes were bright, glowing red again. We both came to about a foot of height, and she knelt on the table. I helped her put the tape over the mirror, then I helped her out of her camisole, and she slid her panties down over her feet and put them down at her ankles. She stood tall and proud. Her large breasts stood out proudly; they looked like balloons. Like an offering to the heavens, they were the size I had been staring at all afternoon, with a tiny gold circle on the nipples, they were hard and stood out like pencil erasers. With just the slightest touch of her hands I could tell that she was still naked underneath. A tiny tuft of dark hair led down between her legs.</p> <p>She looked at me as if she was trying to see into the mirror. Then she looked at me again, and the look of lust on her face was a sexy look. She had that look that drove a man wild; she was obviously turned on, and I could picture that thick bush between her legs.</p> <p>"Are you hard? I was just wondering if you were going to cum," she said, her breath coming in gasps. "And I'm so wet. My pussy is still a little tingly, you'll have to try a little while longer, maybe a whole lot longer. Please, Baby, please!" Her voice quivered with the word, "please". Her lust was written on her face, her eyes glazed with passion.</p> <p>I took her into my arms, and she wrapped her arms around me as she pressed her body against my. Our bodies fit together; her hips met mine. I lifted her and lifted her onto my bed, her legs hanging over the edge like a giant pendulum. I placed her on the bed, then I picked up the tape and put it back in the box.</p> <p>"Baby, would you lie back and take your panties off?" I said, looking over at her.</p> <p>She looked as if she was going to speak, but then her eyes went to the floor, and a big smile came into her face. She lay down; her eyes staring up at the ceiling. I sat next to her and took her ankles in my hand. I gently stroked her feet, feeling her silky smooth skin. "Karen, would you like me to kiss them, to put them in my mouth?" I asked as I turned her legs over my shoulder and brought themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
