We talked about him and me in general, about how good his eyes were as a child, how he and I looked alike in the morning, and the things I thought our friends were going to like about them.</p> <p>I told him I had been looking forward to meeting him, and if he got a chance I just might get him to come to the house for a visit. I explained that we needed to start getting ready for the real things later. He laughed, then began to ask a question. Then, he turned to me and said, quite frankly, 'I don't know what you said in there but I'm definitely interested' as he pointed to the place in the kitchen. He looked around and said, with a broad smile, 'This is the best place we have the place to go.' Then he turned to me and said, 'If you have a nice hotel room we can go to.' He asked where we were staying, and I explained at the other end of the kitchen. 'Okay, maybe a bed and a nice bath and my room, or maybe a place to sit and soak a little before taking your shower.'</p> <p>As he spoke he had placed a few more dishes on the counter and when he started filling the glass with ice, suddenly brought a plate over to the island in the kitchen. He filled the glass with ice and took a sip. I turned to him and he held out his hand. We said 'Shall we go now?' and I accepted and we got up and followed him to the bedroom. I started to get up, and asked 'Why not?' He looked at me and said 'It is a little chilly in here. Could we put a little of this ice on the bed? It would be much more comfortable.' I nodded and we went to get some cold water. He was standing in front of me in his robe as I got onto the bed and I sat down in shock. He saw me staring and gave me a look. His robe fell open revealing an erect cock. He was standing with his knees slightly parted and I reached out to touch it. It was quite a hard cock, not to long (although not very thick) but very thick. I took it in my hand and it was very warm in the warm water.</p> <p>'Now do my back first,' he said. I said, 'I really should be getting into the bath room already.' He got down on his knees and he started to give my shoulders a massage. 'Oh, yes, that is good. Just keep doing that.' Then I felt his hands go to my neck and just move over the muscles.</p> <p>'Does that feel nice?' I asked, not looking up at him.</p> <p>'Oh yes, just like that. God, she is beautiful when she is like this.' His hands started to move over my shoulders and neck very slowly and I felt him rub down to my shoulders until the tips went down my back. 'She is very beautiful.' I had to admit that and I moved my hands up to feel his. 'Your hands are so good.' Then his were on my shoulders and back and his hands began to travel down my sides. My hands had gone so far back that I had to reach back and put my hands in his. It was very soft and the sensation brought back all the feelings of not being touched for so long.</p> <p>'You are very lovely.' I said, in an almost shy voice. It felt good to talk to him for so long. After a while I realized that he had moved down to my thighs and was rubbing his hands against them. When he got to the top of my legs he continued rubbing up and down, and then he moved his hands up and down, spreading oil on me. The sensation was getting to me. I moved my legs apart and he took it upon himself to rub my pussy as I closed my legs. The feeling of his naked body on mine was just so erotic. I could feel his hardness under his robes and my hand was rubbing his cock. We were really heating up again and the feeling was getting better.</p> <p>'I love your body in all its nakedness,' he said, in one of his rather sweetly spoken tone. We both got a little breathless. His hands were rubbing the inside of my thighs now and it felt as if he was trying to find the place where my clit was. It was very warm too. He put his hand on my inner thigh and I put mine on the inside of it. I could feel his fingers pushing against my swollen bud.</p> <p>'Are you ready to go now?' he asked.</p> <p>'I am ready,' I said. I had to put a little pressure on myself to get up and he pushed his chair back under the couch so that we could stand. As we stood facing each other and I got the chance to look at hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
