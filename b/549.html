"Unless you'd rather watch something else."</p> <p>She walked to the end of the bed and began stripping off the last of her clothes, removing her bra. Susan's breasts were large and ripe. They shook slightly as she rolled the fabric away from her body. At forty, Susan looked very fit. I knew from the photos she had posted online. She was probably around five feet nine inches, and the rest of her was a healthy amount of dark hair.</p> <p>Susan climbed on the bed and laid flat on her back. Her body was slightly muscled from cycling every day. Her breasts were big, just a bit larger than I would have guessed. They were round and firm, capped with thick dark nipples. I watched as the dark-haired beauty reached out and ran a finger along her own nipple. They glowed under her touch as I heard her moan softly. Her hand slid around her waist, and soon she was climbing atop her. Her fingers ran lightly across her abdomen, and she moved slowly towards her waiting pussy. In order to begin with, she began rubbing first on the lips, and then, down into the crease where her hips meet her stomach. Susan sighed deeply.</p> <p>"I can't tell how you feel about me, Susan. You're a lot bigger and sexier than me. I wouldn't mind doing anything if you were naked. You're not my typical sex-slave, and you won't even tell me that you'd like to do anything else," I told her as my fingers rubbed her clit. "I've got to admit. You're a lovely woman, and it sounds like fun to have some sexy fun with you. Maybe I could help you discover that pleasure you're missing from your life. Have you done anything with a woman, or had a man touch you while you were alone?"</p> <p>She groaned once again, and her body quivered against her hand. "I guess if I could just find someone I've been wanting to touch, I might be able to find pleasure in doing that for him. Maybe I'll even have a new lover," She replied quietly. Her body continued to shake in an attempt to hold back a moan.</p> <p>"It sounds pretty good. Let's try it, and see how you like it." I offered. I pulled the covers over her, and then knelt on the bed beside her.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" I asked as I kissed the tip of her nipple softly. Susan nodded once, and I kissed my way downward. Her pussy was neat and smooth, dark hair barely reaching below the point I wanted. There wasn't a blemish on Susan's vagina. I could smell her arousal, and I could feel the heat coming from where I was sitting. Susan was moaning and writhing as I kissed and licked the outer and inner lips, and then the tiny inner lips. Susan closed her eyes and her arms held the covers closer to her. She began pulling at the buttons on my shirt as I teased her pink pussy with my mouth. Her pussy tightened around the tip of my tongue, and I heard her gasp as I lightly scraped her clit.</p> <p>Susan grabbed onto the sheets, trying to pull her pelvis higher towards my face. Her hands dug into the duvet material, as she thrust up into my face. I continued to lick, and she began to shake and then relax, as waves of her orgasm crashed over her. When her orgasm had subsided, I raised myself up a little. I raised my mouth and my teeth and, still tongue-fucking her, I bit her left tit. I knew I didn't hurt her as her hand pressed into my back. She was holding on tightly as I removed my own shirt.</p> <p>"You like it, don't you?" I asked as I leaned down to kiss her.</p> <p>"You don't mind if I let you have your fun, do you?" she asked as her legs lifted to wrap around me.</p> <p>"I love it." I told her as I wrapped my arms around her and rolled to her side. I reached down and began to gently stroke her pussy. "You're so wet and slippery. Are you sure you won't cum yourself?" I teased.</p> <p>"No, I don't think so. Would you mind if I could keep that from you?" she asked as she slid farther forward to straddle my stomach.</p> <p>"Oh, sure." I answered her as I slipped my hands under her thighs and lifted her up. "You're all that matters right now. I wish I'd made some changes in your life so I would have a chance to find happiness with you. I don't care what it is.
