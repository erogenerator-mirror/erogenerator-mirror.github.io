While she was going to lick me out I stood up and slid my finger in her pussy. I slowly fucked her with two of my fingers, keeping an eye on her. Her knees weakened and my fingers were sopping wet.</p> <p>She pulled her panties off so I could insert one of them in. She sat on the edge of the bed with her legs splayed and my mouth between her thigh, my nose pressing into her moist mound, my finger still deep in her pussy. I licked, nibbled, sucked and fingered her to a crescendo as she moaned with ecstasy. I put my mouth on her clit as deeply as my tongue could go. I licked her as my tongue continued to stroke her clit. She started to buck as she got closer and closer to a massive orgasm. She began to tremble and shake as she got closer to what may be the best orgasm yet. I licked her clit as fast as I could and when she screamed for me to cum with her I licked and sucked her clit until she finally came one last time. My tongue was still inside her as she came on it. I was amazed at the feelings as she came. She squeezed her thighs around my head tightly just as she had just when I removed my fingers. With my free hand I squeezed some cum into her pussy. My thumb found her clit as it swelled and throbbed with orgasmic energy.</p> <p>As she came down from her climax she opened her eyes. Her eyes were wide looking at me, smiling. "Oh, Tom, I don't know how to say thank you!" That made me feel even more special as she said that. She smiled, kissed me gently and went to the bathroom. I was a bit stunned because it was pretty obvious that she wanted me. She was in fact very attracted to me. She just had the nicest eyes. I was surprised, pleased and extremely happy that we were having sex with one another in a bedroom.</p> <p>After a few minutes she got dressed again. We had a glass of wine and she said that she could get dinner ready just after we ate. There was another note, this time, which simply read "Eat me" . We sat in awkward silence for a couple of minutes. Finally I realized why she had said "Eat" and it made my heart beat hard. What had I gotten myself into? I didn't even know her name, let alone if she wanted me or that we had a history. The truth was that I wasn't into women at all. She never said 'Tom', and she never asked what I wanted or that I was interested in. I felt like a little kid again.</p> <p>After we finished our meal, I drove her home. After kissing her goodnight, I drove her to her parent's house. The day is the same every week. The last thing I see is a beautiful, smiling face, a beautiful, wonderful smile, and the most gorgeous smile you'll ever receive.</p> <p>The next day was Saturday. It was a beautiful sunny day and I found a tree in the yard. In the distance I could hear the roar of thunder in the west. I found a place with a good vantage point, took a couple of sips from my wine, and just sat there. I don't think I had ever been more content in my life.</p> <p>The first thing she did was take me into the back yard. She laid me down and we went to her parent's house like lovers and just spent a couple minutes making out that way. It was very tender and fun. Her mother was there and sat in a high, back chair reading a book. Mom gave me a little kiss as I sat on the chair and watched the scene unfold before me.</p> <p>I was watching the other couple, and the wife just stood up and walked to the front door. The husband and wife smiled at each other, got up and went to the front door. The house was completely dark. I could still hear the pounding of thunder in the distance. I thought about going to bed, and it was getting late. The next several minutes were strained and uncharacteristic for a couple in a long term relationship. When I got to my car, I could not believe how hard it had been trying to figure out what to say. Finally I spoke, "Well, Mom, that was fun, but, I'm not so sure that I can just go to sleep." I was trying to make light of it, but the words were, "Tom . . . I want you, but don't be too obvious."</p> <p>"Sorry," I said, "I guess having sex with your Mom was really not the best idea in the world."</p> <p>"Tom," she said, "This isn't just about sex, it's about loving each other. I'm really in love with you Tomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
