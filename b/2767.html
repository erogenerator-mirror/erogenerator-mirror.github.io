The angle of his penetration surprised me, and my eyes squeezed shut as I sat in awe of his length; I could feel the head of his cock touch the top of my pussy, the warm flesh of his cock. I leaned forward. I sat on his cock as it thrust in and out, feeling him penetrate my tunnel. I opened myself to him, taking all of him in me. He put one arm around my waist, and gently played with my clit as he fucked me. I loved the feeling as my orgasm built inside and rushed to meet my orgasm. I let go of my inhibitions and let my body lie back on my bed with his cock plunging inside me.</p> <p>I wanted him still inside me, not to move. As I got to the brink of my own orgasm, I realized that I wasn't alone. "Fuck me," I said, as I felt his cock slide out of me. He turned me around and sat me on the side of the bed. He spread my legs further apart, taking off his shirt and pants. He then climbed on top of me, put his cock back to my pussy and slowly started fucking me. I reached down and rubbed his balls and then began rubbing my clit, feeling him enter me. He leaned forward and bit my nipples lightly; they were hard enough to stab at the end of my breasts. I was in an orgasmic mood.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, yes," I begged him, taking him in my hand and rubbing his balls. "Do it."</p> <p>He picked my feet back up onto the bed, spread my legs even further apart, and pushed his cock into me again, making me want him more. He was pumping me now, his balls slapping my ass, hitting all the right places in turn. He leaned back on my chest and began fucking me really hard. I spread my legs again, feeling his length pound into the sensitive flesh of my pussy, and the heat his body gave me. There was so much more to this situation than I had imagined. I reached down with my hands and rubbed my clit in earnest. I was in love to be taken like this. I wanted him to fuck me even more, like that. He began to fuck me faster, deeper.</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me. Fuck me," I screamed.</p> <p>He slammed hard against me. He grabbed my hands and put them on my breasts. "Oh, yeah," he said as he started pumping me harder and deeper inside me. "That feels so good." His fingers rubbed my nipples and pinched my clit. The sensations from his hand on my nipple and his cock inside me sent me to the edge. I could feel his cock swelling, his balls tightening.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I said as he began to cum in me. He leaned forward even more and put one hand on my stomach, still pumping me as he came in me. He fell on top of me and kissed my ear. He leaned down and we kissed passionately while he was still inside me. "Do you love me?" he asked me in an attempt to get my answer.</p> <p>"Of course I love you," I said. "Yes, you're so much fun to be with. Wherever I went wrong." He raised his head and smiled at me, kissed me again, and whispered "Thank you," in my ear. He then laid on top of me, kissed me and kissed my cheek again.</p> <p>We were exhausted on this bed of sweat. I laid there on the bed, completely naked and he in his boxers. We kissed and talked, and I told him everything about my past, my sex life with Mark, and that I had been faithful to Mark, as usualâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
