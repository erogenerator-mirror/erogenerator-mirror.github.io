This isn't that easy!" she said, as she lifted her legs and pulled them back against her face, giving him even better access, then slid them even further apart, showing her wet, pink hole. Then he began to lick and suck her gently all around the inside.</p> <p>"I hope you are a nice kisser," Mary breathed.</p> <p>"That's why I love it, baby. I love feeling you kiss and lick me," he told her, as he gently slipped his tongue just inside her cunt.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmmm!" he said before he kissed his way up her body and to her breasts.</p> <p>"You got some tongue for sure, honey," Mary breathed, as she kissed him on the mouth.</p> <p>Once again, Mary felt a thrill of excitement. She wasn't sure what to call her cousin, but the feelings she was experiencing right then were quite unusual. Her heart fluttered just a bit as her body shuddered with pleasure.</p> <p>"You got your tongue all the way up here?" she asked.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm," he replied, and continued to kiss his way up the sides of her neck and along her right ear, which smelled of sex.</p> <p>His tongue swirled around in her ear, then moved even lower to her throat. He sucked on her ear and bit it lightly at the same time, causing her whole body shiver again. She let out a low moan as he did that.</p> <p>He kissed her throat again, and pulled on her left nipple with his teeth, causing her to let out a little yelp. While he did that, his hands slipped down to her cunt. They moved up the outside of her thigh to her leg, which he now used to guide his hand under to her thigh. His fingers found her wet hole, and he began to massage his fingers inside the folds of her pussy, while he kissed her neck again and up to her ear. Her fingers were caressing his neck and chest, and even rubbing his nipples.</p> <p>"Ohh...mmmmmm...you're so good at this, James...mmmmmm," Mary told him as she wrapped her fingers around him.</p> <p>She felt a new excitement building in her, as her body and mind were on fire. She felt her nipples jutting up and the wetness between her legs start to increase.</p> <p>Once again, he stopped and held her close.</p> <p>"You're sure you want to try out this?" he asked, as while holding her, he pulled back a little and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"I'd love to," she replied, looking into his eyes.</p> <p>He moved his lips towards hers and they kissed, a wet and passionate kiss. Mary ran her hands over his broad shoulders and around his neck. She felt his erection pushing into her, and knew she hadn't worn a condom as her boyfriend had told her to wear. In fact, she was just about to lose her cherry.</p> <p>His kiss moved down her chin to her neck where it became a long and sensual sensual kiss. Her breathing quickened and she moaned again.</p> <p>"Yes, you're so wet, sweetheart. You're still a virgin, aren't you?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Just a few days ago I was going to get a new toy, and I didn't, so I was on the pill," he said.</p> <p>"How does a good virgin kiss feel?" she asked him.</p> <p>"It's the most erotic thing I've ever felt, Mary," he told her.</p> <p>"Do you remember our first time?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, about 8 hours ago," he told her.</p> <p>"When we had sex?" she asked him.</p> <p>"I had sex with a girl last year," he told her.</p> <p>"That's the first time I ever had sex," he told her.</p> <p>"You remember that," she said, with a wicked gleam in her eye.</p> <p>He moved the tip of his tongue from her breasts up and down between her nipples, teasing them with each pass of his tongue.</p> <p>"I could tell," she added.</p> <p>"I could, too," he said, and kissed her once again for the second time tonight.</p> <p>After they both got a kiss each, he moved back to her neck. He took her hands and gently held them and moved her hand inside his shirt.</p> <p>She reached her hand down and felt his cock hard and throbbing in her hand.</p> <p>"So big," she whispered.</p> <p>"How long have you been holding out?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Nearly 18 months," she told him.</p> <p>"That can't possibly be a lot longer," he said with a smileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
