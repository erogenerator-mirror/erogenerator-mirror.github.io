I am sure he could use the help. Why don't you do the same?"</p> <p>"I don't know" I answer.</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean." She states.</p> <p>"The same," I agree.</p> <p>"You were going to stay with me tonight." She states.</p> <p>I was happy to respond, as I thought if she were with me, and the rest of the night would be much more exciting but she was with family and friends who were all at least 20 years older, so I said</p> <p>"Are you sure that's what we are doing?"</p> <p>"I could just stay here and not have to worry about another person."</p> <p>Again, I responded, but this time, it was almost a statement.</p> <p>"What do you propose we do with the night out if we can go to the movies, and maybe have a good romantic moment. I really don't know about you being there but I am game if that's what you want."</p> <p>"You're going to stay here with me tonight!"</p> <p>"I really don't know what you're talking about." I look around and realize that if anyone wants to look me up, it is probably them. "I mean, we can go to a bar or have a drink and you can pick a movie. Why not make our night out by going at it on my back. I think it's better than driving through a storm and taking a couple showers. At least that way we can get our clothes off and maybe have a fun night. I don't care but I have reservations about the movie at the movies I'll pick it up with and it'll be good entertainment."</p> <p>I could feel my heart beating fast and my cock begin to swell. "I'm game" I thought to myself.</p> <p>"Okay," she says then looks around and realizes that it is just to go. "Okay!" She continues. "Don't be out too late, and you can come over to my place at any time. It's just you and me, so don't rush." She says.</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am." I reply.</p> <p>She then walks back towards the door and I watch her butt twirl back and forth as it jiggles with each step she takes.</p> <p>When she reaches the door, she looks me up and down again as her ass jiggles with each one but she says nothing. She then walks out of the door, shuts it behind her, and closes the door.</p> <p>I can't believe how happy it makes me to be able to live this fantasy without wondering why it happened. She walked towards me looking as happy and confident as ever, but with a very different expression on her face.</p> <p>With the exception of her walk towards me, and her body walking towards me, she looked different. She was a little more chubby but somehow that made her seem different and alluring in my eyes.</p> <p>"See you in the morning." She said as she kissed my cheek.</p> <p>***** My room was about half a block away from her. We went back to her house and I drove her to pick up her car. I walked her around the house looking her over from head to toe. It was very flattering to feel a little like I was her. I was very nervous about getting her to go out with me but she knew it would be just the two of us tonight. I was a little nervous even though we had been talking for about 45 minutes and she asked me if I was okay.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm looking forward to having you home with me after all." I told her.</p> <p>"Okay, I'm happy to hear that." She responded as she opened the door for me.</p> <p>I followed her inside and she took off her jacket and took off a button on her blouse and dropped it on the couch. I noticed she had no bra on and I admired her firm and shapely breasts. I stood in front of her looking at her and I almost drooled watching her, when she dropped her bag and she pulled off her skirt and laid it over my knees.</p> <p>"Now would you be a good boy and help me undress." She said.</p> <p>I moved slowly towards her and undid the buttons of her blouse. I removed it and sat down in my car to help her with it. I felt my cock get more and more hard as I did so.</p> <p>She then removed her skirt and stood before me wearing only a bra. She looked at me as she slowly shook her chest out of her bra with her hands, like her body was going to take it off at any time.</p> <p>"I like the feel of your shirt against me too."
