I smiled as I turned on the headlights and watched the city below. The city was beautiful and I liked the feel of the city on my legs all the way home.</p> <p>I slowed down and pulled into the driveway of Mrs. White. She was home and when I saw her standing under the stars, I just stopped in place.</p> <p>"Welcome home!" I said as I walked into her home.</p> <p>We just stood there talking for a moment.</p> <p>"I see you have a nice surprise for me tonight," she said sweetly.</p> <p>"Not a very many surprises are left for me." I replied.</p> <p>Mrs. White stepped out of the SUV and handed me a large plastic cup. She took me home and sat down in her chair.</p> <p>"Let me get this in your mouth," she said.</p> <p>I grabbed the cup and took a gulp of the wine. It actually did taste good. I had a nice hard cock which I used to give a good workout with. I could feel the sweat starting to fall off my forehead from the heat of the AC. I set the cup down on her large leather covered desk. I walked over and sat down. She sat back in her chair and leaned her arms across her knees. I moved over to her and sat on her lap, her legs were spread slightly apart. I sat there and waited.</p> <p>"You look so fucking sexy," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know... I'm just having a great time," she said.</p> <p>I put my arms around her neck and kissed her on the mouth. As I kissed her, I began to stroke her hair. We kissed for a few minutes. I had her head on my shoulder and we hugged each other. At this point I could feel my cock standing straight out. I began to feel her pussy through her skirt. I reached up and ran my hand along the line of her slit. She spread her legs slightly. I rubbed her clit and watched the small amount of material disappearing between her legs. I slid my hand back and forth, from the outside of her panties.</p> <p>"I just love having you rub my clit," she said as she rubbed my cock with her hand. I pulled back from her and unbuttoned her blouse. I slid her slacks down to the floor. She stood in front of me wearing only a lacy bra and panties and a pair of socks.</p> <p>"I bought this outfit a couple of months ago when we got married," she said.</p> <p>"It was a gift from my old college roommate," I said.</p> <p>"Is he married?" she asked.</p> <p>"No. It's my first marriage. I'm a bit of a catch up in the dating scene," I replied.</p> <p>"No, he is my first. We just met today," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't care... I love a good time with you... So you're married?" I said</p> <p>"Yeah I am."</p> <p>"I'm fucking married on my birthday... and I'm going to love every second of it," I said.</p> <p>I kissed her passionately. She had a sexy pucker that was a little darker than the hair on her head.</p> <p>We kissed some more while I began pulling her bra out of her skirt. I quickly removed it and found her breasts. They were magnificent. Firm and heavy with small dark nipples. I was still rubbing my hand up and down her slit. I could feel her wetness around my cock. My cock stood straight up. I pushed her back against the wall of her office. I began kissing and nibbling on her neck as she moaned softly. She pushed back into me and began rubbing my cock through my pants. I unbuckled the top and removed her bra. I was still sucking and kissing her neck and running my hands over and around her breasts. Her nipples were standing at attention and her breasts were firm and stood out proudly. I began to suck on her nipples slowly. I slowly pulled my eyes from her breasts. I looked at her face and saw her eyes closed. I licked her right nipple and nibbled my way down to her left nipple. I was teasing her, kissing her and working her breasts in my hands. I let both breasts pop out and began sucking on the nipples again.</p> <p>"What are you doing? Don't..." she said.</p> <p>I continued to play with her breasts and suck on her nipples. I let my hands slide up her toned flat belly and to her stomach. I lifted up her shirt and began to slide my hand underneath. I reached around and began to stroke her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh... I need some cock... I need some cock," she said.</p> <p>I kissed her once more and helped her take of her bra and panties.
