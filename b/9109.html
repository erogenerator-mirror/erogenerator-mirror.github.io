I can be happy fucking it anytime."</p> <p>"Oh, just shut up." I replied. I wasn't really in the mood for that.</p> <p>He took me by the waist and carried me off the bed again. Just as I was starting to let out all my tension, he pulled me over the side.</p> <p>"Hey, are you okay, sweetie?" He called from the bedroom door once I was safely on the ground.</p> <p>"You can come in if you want. My pussy is too sore to sit for a minute."</p> <p>"I'll be out in just a second." He grabbed a bottle of KY from his bedside table drawer and poured some down into his hands. He started stroking his cock with one hand while he looked at me through teary eyes.</p> <p>"Can you grab a hold of it?" He asked as he held it in his hand.</p> <p>I just nodded and started stroking the big, hard dick. It was so hard that I could barely get the head through my hand. My first instinct was to just do it. I wasn't sure whether to stroke it or jerk it off in my hand. I felt the head bump my palm and it felt so good.</p> <p>"Oh, that's so good, baby. Just a little. Just a little at first. Just a little... ahh! That's good." My dick was just starting to get really hard.</p> <p>He smiled at me. "My first shot of jizz is the same as that, and I can tell that you're ready, baby."</p> <p>I smiled. "Oh, yeah, right away."</p> <p>I looked down at my hard on and was surprised the thickness of it, with thick, angry veins running down the middle, was even larger than in my imagination. I could feel my shaft pulsing, throbbing with my heartbeat.</p> <p>"Can you cum hard, baby? Like, like... on me?"</p> <p>I reached down and held the base to lift my fist so that it rested on the top of the shaft as I stroked it. I used my hand to rub my cock up and down, using my palm to massage it. My heart was beating faster and faster as my hand worked up and down his prick.</p> <p>"I like it when you touch it like that," he said, looking down at me as he jerked himself off. "It makes me feel very sexy."</p> <p>I felt my heart swell and my chest constrict as I leaned forward and engulfed his entire cock. His pubic hair mashed my nose and lips and I held him tightly. After a few seconds I could feel his heart starting to race again. With a groan like a gusher, he started spurting his thick, creamy cum. I felt it spray across my cheek in all directions, across my eyes and down my neck and chest. The first blast missed the skin but it splashed up against my belly button and it splashed into my hair. His second blast sent a jet of creamy thick cum across my stomach. The final blast landed on my chest and he continued to fuck my hand. I was surprised at how intense the ejaculation was.</p> <p>"Oh, you did good," he said as he sat down. He put his arm over me, resting his hand next to my ribs.</p> <p>"Your first shot, is like... wow, you really came all over me..."</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed my lips. They were so soft.</p> <p>"You look beautiful," he said as he pulled his head back and looked at me.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not the only one," I said. I felt dizzy as I realized that he was staring at me. I don't remember it getting so hot, just the thought that he had watched me cum, got me turned on.</p> <p>"That was amazing." He was quiet for a few seconds, just staring at me. "Wow, you're amazing. Really, really... hot." He didn't say anything else, just pulled on his dick and started to rise. His balls were tight, his cock was so hard and it was oozing out all that white creamy stuff.</p> <p>I leaned my head back against his chest and rested my head on the other side of him as he continued to lean against the pillows. "How about we go and get more comfortable?"</p> <p>"I think that we might be just a little bit more comfortable."</p> <p>"I didn't see you standing up. I just realized that you were trying to get the bed over me." We got to the bed and he pushed me back and sat down next to me on the bed.</p> <p>He looked at me. "You're already naked."</p> <p>"Are we making a deal?" I said. "You still have your shirt, donâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
