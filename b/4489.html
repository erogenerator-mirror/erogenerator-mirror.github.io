She gasped and her breathing became shorter. I leaned in and kissed the skin of the side of her neck and she tilted her head to kiss me back. She was so hot. I wanted to devour her, make her come again and again until we both collapsed onto the bed in a heap.</p> <p>I sat up on the bed and looked down at the man I was fucking, and I saw that he hadn't touched himself in a very long time, but I knew it wouldn't be long now. I climbed on the bed with him, straddling his hips. I sat back on my heels and looked her in the eyes.</p> <p>"I'd really like to do this," I said, leaning forward. "But I'm not sure I'll be able to do this with you." She smiled and reached out for my cock. "There's a table up there," she said. "I'm glad I brought along some lube." He nodded and walked back towards the table. She set one of the condom's on the table for me. "Is there a room up there?" she asked him. "I think there is," he replied. I was about ten seconds from shooting off again, but I quickly pulled out of the woman.</p> <p>We talked and laughed about a variety of things, but mostly we just talked and laughed. "You can have the bed and I can help you with the rest of your clothes if you want," I told her. "And if you want something, just let me know." She nodded, smiled, and headed to the bathroom. She came back, took her clothes, put them on, and came back out for me to give her a kiss.</p> <p>"You know that's one of the most erotic things a man and his woman can do," She said. I nodded and we started again. He was still hard as a rock, and I was pretty good at stroking him, since he was so hard. I leaned back against the headboard. "Do you think that's your favorite thing?" I asked him. He nodded. "Well you definitely want to do this, and I want you to," I answered him. Her eyes almost popped from the corners as she saw that. She started taking me into her mouth, not quite on the tip, just on the other side, and it made me almost lose it as she made her way up and down and along the length of me. I was at the point of no return.</p> <p>"I'm gonna come," I said. My hands went to the back of her head and I pushed her down on me, her lips never leaving me. I shot a load of semen into the air then. She felt it on her cheek and chin. She kissed it and looked up at me.</p> <p>"That tastes good," she told him. "I want to taste myself on you." I nodded at her. Then I leaned forward and kissed the side of her mouth, then the tops of her breasts and she kissed me back. She pulled back and put her hands on both sides of my head while she looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"I want more," she insisted. "You're in charge." I nodded and she nodded again and leaned down to put both of my hands on her breasts. I gently rubbed her small mounds, squeezing them a little, feeling how stiff and full they were. She took my cock in one hand and worked it back and forth, watching me fondle her tits.</p> <p>"I think I can come now," I said. She smiled and put her hand on my dick. She rubbed it a couple of times then and I felt the tingling in my balls as she did that.</p> <p>"You're gonna have to come inside me," she said to him. "It's still a little early for me..."</p> <p>She gave him a soft, but gentle, kiss on the lips, then she left the room. I lay there on the bed, staring at a ceiling fan in the corner of the room. It was warm and cool while I lay there, my head lying on the pillow. I knew I had to cum, but I really wanted to come. I rolled over and went into the shower. I got dressed in the clothes I had been wearing and decided to make my way back to my own office.</p> <p>I sat at my desk and turned on the monitor to see what my boss was doing. "Hi," I said. "I'm working at the warehouse." The computer monitor looked good enough to eat. It was in the middle of this office, with a big, round metal window to the office. No one bothered to put their stuff up there. My boss was a nice looking fellow.
