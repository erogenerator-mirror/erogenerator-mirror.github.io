"I didn't have anything to do with it, I was just getting comfortable". I looked at mom. "Come on, you and I need to sit down."</p> <p>"Sure, let me grab a cold one of us something to drink." I told mom, but we didn't have much time before dad was home again. I started looking around the room for something to put on my body and mom decided on a white tank top and the blue jeans. I couldn't believe how pretty she looked, and even though she was not my mother I still thought she would look good. I was standing about ten feet away from the door, and I thought maybe she would even come closer. I did a quick study of her face. She had a beautiful smile that made my heart race. She had beautiful green eyes that always seemed to know what to do to make my heart race. Her hair was pulled back tightly and her shirt almost reached its collar, her black bra showed little through the black fabric. I could tell she was not wearing a bra under her shirt because every time it happened it became obvious through her chest she was wearing one. I thought to myself how I wanted to see that all the time, to be able to take advantage of her every chance I could.</p> <p>After the beers mom decided to go and sit to the right of me. She took about five steps when my head started to get up. I stood there a second and watched her. I could not believe it before. I never would have thought of myself as a gay boy. I just got it so that I could get a close up look at her. She just crossed the distance and sat down in front of me. My hands just touched, the warmth of her body felt so good. She then reached up to my neck and neck. I could not believe it.</p> <p>"Hey sweetie, would you please pull over for a minute?"</p> <p>I smiled. "Yeah, sure." My hands were still on her legs up above her knees. I leaned forward and started to kiss her neck. "Mmmmmh, oh I want to." I ran my tongue over her skin causing a shiver to run through her body. My lips moved down to her collar bone and I started to kiss around it. Mom's back arched at my touch and her neck. I kissed her collar bone lightly while I kissed her, my lips never leaving her skin. I gently moved down her neck as I continued down her chest kissing around her breasts. My hands gently brushed her nipples with my fingers, making more and more of her skin.</p> <p>"I want to feel you touch my skin baby." She said softly as I continued kissing down her stomach I could feel her breathing become a little heavier. I took off the shirt and pants that were already off. I moved my hand under her skirt and felt the damp spot. I took my lips off hers and pulled her panties off. I pulled her pants back up and slid my fingers inside her. I could feel her warm tightness. I found her opening with my finger and spread her with my finger. I moved my head and lips to her breast. Mom began to moan. Her hands caressed my head as she grabbed my hair. I moved my other hand down to her mound, I could feel her juices dripping down over my fingers. I started to move my mouth over her mound as I continued to rub her, making her moan louder. I could feel her hands run all over my head as my mouth found her clit.</p> <p>Mom pulled my head to her mouth as her orgasm continued to come. Her body became rigid as I continued to lick her and touch her. Slowly the waves of the orgasm started to recede, but she still didn't let me touch her.</p> <p>"No please don't stop."</p> <p>"You can continue, I want to."</p> <p>"I want more." Her words just made my lusts grow even more.</p> <p>I moved up her body and kissed her, still on my own. Kissing me softly she reached up and pulled me back.</p> <p>"I never would have thought I would be this aroused that much." She leaned back onto the couch. She took her legs off the couch, and I climbed on top of her. I lowered my body and took her into my mouth. My tongue stroked her clit, making her moan. I slid my tongue in and out, making her orgasm a little closer. My mouth moved from her clit, stopping only after she had started shaking. I took my hand and rubbed her clit withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
