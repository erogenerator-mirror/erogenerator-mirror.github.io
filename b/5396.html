My heart skipped then it felt like it would burst.</p> <p>"What do you want?" I stammered out a simple phrase that I had never asked permission for, as a reply and I felt myself blushing as his eyes dropped to my chest and then back up again in a way that looked like he was watching a big smile appear on my face.</p> <p>"I've always been attracted to you," he told me. "Never ever felt anything, even one touch."</p> <p>I felt my cheeks blushing.</p> <p>"I know." I answered and as I answered I saw that I'd done the right thing by talking about him.</p> <p>"I think you are very attractive to me," he said and I felt myself blushing even more, not from his deep eyes but from the fact that they seemed to be burning into me, taking my breath away.</p> <p>"You think I'm beautiful?" I whispered softly, "And I'm very interested in you, if you think that's something you should ask."</p> <p>"That's a yes," he said. He stood up and then stood in front of me, his eyes still burning into mine and I watched in awe as he reached down, took my hands and kissed them, my heart was about to stop when I felt his hardness press into me through our clothes as he leaned a bit forward, I looked up to see the smile on his face as he brushed my long hair away from my neck as he whispered into my ear.</p> <p>"Take off your clothes," he whispered. His voice seemed to reverberate from the tip of my head to my toes as I moved to undo my laces and then, suddenly, the zipper on his shirt. I saw him reach out to me again and this time I felt the softness of his fingers as they rested on my skin as he began pulling my clothing off. For a moment we stood there kissing, his fingers running up and down my arms, feeling me trembling a little bit. He then hooked his fingers around the top of my panties and I almost jumped out of his hold. Slowly I drew them down my legs, his fingers moving smoothly from my hips up over my mound and then slowly back down under my panties as he slid off his. We stepped back as our clothes fell off and as he held them up to the light beside the bed I felt the warmth of his body as his breath hit me in my face once again as his voice took over and I felt my heart race as he whispered;</p> <p>"Now lie down," he said softly. "Turn over."</p> <p>He placed a small towel on the bed and then I felt myself turning into a half-naked mess and then I felt his hands touch my chest again and the feeling of his fingers touching my erect nipples as they felt as if they were on fire.</p> <p>"Do you agree?" he asked with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm... I'm not sure," I started, trying to decide if I should continue to undress and then felt myself start to pull away but he just put his hand in my hair and just sort of pushed me back into the bed as he lowered his body beside mine and pulled my head down slightly and turned my face towards his and we kissed again.</p> <p>His lips parted and his tongue probed my lips gently licking them and feeling my tongue as he licked my lip and sucking it. I was still shaking, not from what he was doing, but from what he was doing to me, from what I was doing for him. My whole body began it trembling as his tongue flicked over my lip sending sensations though it, the feeling of passion and love as I closed my eyes and relished in his kisses, feeling his hands pressing my breasts over the material of my clothes and feeling his hardness as he kissed and touched me.</p> <p>I felt him pushing up the hem of my shirt, the buttons feeling to me like iron, the feel of it against the back of my body as the shirt pulled free from my hands and then he began sliding it down, his lips and hands moving to my navel as he slid the last of it from my body.</p> <p>His eyes were watching me and then he pushed the shirt out away my arms to allow it to be moved from my body and, finally, his eyes met mine as his lips closed over my nipple and he sucked it in and let his lips pull back, the sensation of his mouth almost as if my nipple were his own as I felt his tongue and then I felt like I was going to explode and when he pushed his fingers into my body a little further and then his tongue began again to dance on my nipple as his hands were pulling my breasts over my shoulders and I felt the tension between us as I felt him kiss and tug on my nipples, and then I felt his fingertips lightly tracing up over my neck and then over to lightly trail over my lips, thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
