I mean my entire life! I mean I am not so much in love with him as in I am in love with the person I believe I actually feel. Now I just hate that it is only because I'm afraid. It's not that I want to be loved so much as I don't want to be a part of the family. I don't want that kind of jealousy with you all the time. I don't want the two of you and all of you to be together because I don't want that. I don't want this and I know I'm not in love with you. I don't like the feeling of you, your body, your presence, all of that. It's not love between a married man and a woman. It just makes me want the world to look at me and know I am loved by some man. A woman can love someone and she can love them too."</p> <p>"I know what you mean. I know it's what I need. I'm going to hate you too for not understanding. I've never had a problem with the person I love."</p> <p>"But why?" I asked, trying to understand her.</p> <p>"I'm married," she told me, "I told you I couldn't handle a relationship. I know it's wrong. I don't like it, but I just don't want to be with it. You're a man, so that's okay isn't it? The marriage is a gift for us. We are made for each other. It's not meant to be this way. It's just for us. It's not supposed to be meant to be shared."</p> <p>We sat there staring at each other. "I'm not going to be able to keep that line of thought, so I guess what I am suggesting is that maybe we shouldn't talk about it anymore."</p> <p>"I don't think that will be a problem," she told me. "I could understand if we didn't. We are going to have a big fight tomorrow if I go to a conference. You could just go to a meeting."</p> <p>"I think it would bother your husband if I talked like that and then you went out on the phone and that's how we deal with those things. What if he didn't think it would bother him?"</p> <p>She just looked at me and squeezed my hand trying to reassure me. "I don't know if this is really you, but there are many ways I'd go out on a date. I'd probably go back to a more casual date. I don't know about that, but there are other ways I might like it. It wouldn't be so bad of me to make it with you and my husband and I feel so much better about it if you like."</p> <p>"Do you and Mike ever play?"</p> <p>"Yes and no, we've had some problems since day one. He was an okay guy, but you and I have never really gotten that serious."</p> <p>"Well, he was better than he ever had to be and he told me not to get my hopes up because of how you and I have been."</p> <p>"Do I get to make him happy too?"</p> <p>"Sure and no, but I'm going to be in a committed relationship with all of you until we get to that."</p> <p>"How long will you be away from home?"</p> <p>"I'm really busy right now and at times will go to the office. I could never do that. I work a lot with my job, so sometimes I might have to catch a cab to work."</p> <p>"You work at a place in town where anyone could be driving by."</p> <p>"That sort of sucks and it just makes me feel like a whore."</p> <p>"Don't worry. I would hate for you to go back to your boyfriend."</p> <p>"That was nice of him to point in that direction. But it's not that I hate you. It's just that I have always thought that you would be better off off if you didn't have the money to spend."</p> <p>"You know, my life has been a nightmare of being alone."</p> <p>"I can only hope that we can get through it together," I told her. "I just know I feel the same way."</p> <p>A few days later, I was doing the usual office thing. This time I was working all day in the office. It wasn't much, but it was enough to keep me occupied the rest of the month. I could do without all the paperwork like this. I got up once or twice to go over some important memos and I was always in the office long after a while. Mike would be gone a long time and I would be home. I spent a lot of my time at home, reading, waiting for Mike toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
