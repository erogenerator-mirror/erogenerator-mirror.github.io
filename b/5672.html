I grabbed at her tits and began to knead them as she bounced herself up and down. My fingers slid up to her clit, and she lifted her head and bit my shoulder, moaning, her lips parted. She slid back down and my dick felt the heat of her pussy as the lips parted. She slid back up again, just a minute or two this time, the head of my cock rubbing against the wetness of her hot box. She pressed down onto my cock, and my hands moved to her bare ass, gently kneading and pulling her butt cheeks, spreading the crack of her pussy open.

One hand held her cheeks open as the other moved to her clit. I felt my release, my cum filling her, the heat of her pussy against the head of my dick. As she came I lifted her up; my cock slipped out and she collapsed flat against my side. She rolled onto her stomach, and I watched it disappear inside her ass. She smiled and lifted her head to kiss.</p> <p>"Next time," she said, "maybe we could find a way to do that on the truck bed...or the bed in backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
