He looked so incredible - his blue eyes open as his lips sucked on my nipple, his tongue licking the other, and he was moaning softly, begging for release. I teased his ass with my finger, rubbing it along the cleft to his puckered hole, making him grow even harder. He moaned louder now, arching his back to push his chest further into the bed. I wanted to see him suffer, to punish him as much as I did him. So, I pushed the finger inside slowly, working it slowly in and out, knowing that he was begging for my pleasure. I looked up to see his eyes rolling into the back of his head from pleasure, but he just kept staring in the mirror.</p> <p>I felt his body convulse, his back arching as his body spasmed, then relaxed as his fingers and hands relaxed.</p> <p>“Oh my god!” he sighed.</p> <p>“It was beautiful.” I purred.</p> <p>I moved my finger out to lick him some more, then let it slide out.</p> <p>Then, I moved it to his mouth, pressing it to his lips so he could taste himself. He did, his tongue running up and down my finger and I smiled when he sucked it.</p> <p>“Is that better?” I asked.</p> <p>All he could manage to choke out was, “I think so.”</p> <p>I went back to the bed, wanting to feel his skin on mine and wanting to feel him between my legs. Then, I got up slowly, trailing my fingers over his skin as I moved past him, my hips swaying as I passed. When I got to the end of the bed, I gently took his hand, moving it to my backside as I moved slowly down the bed. Then, I took his hand and placed it back on my ass, my head turned so he could look. I bent down to him eagerly, kissing him deeply.</p> <p>Then, I broke off of him.</p> <p>“Is that better?” I whispered.</p> <p>He smiled. “It's better. Much, much better.”</p> <p>I knelt and took him into my hands, my tongue slipping along his shaft, making him shiver and moan in need. I smiled broadly.</p> <p>“It always is.” I replied.</p> <p>I took my hands away, still smiling softly. I looked at his hand on my ass-cheeks.</p> <p>“I always get this way sometimes.” I said.</p> <p>He just smiled back, his fingers still exploring my holes and his body still quivering in need for release.</p> <p>I pulled his hands off my ass to get a better look.</p> <p>“Is it okay, Adam?”</p> <p>He looked confused for a moment, then smiled.</p> <p>“Do you want my ass?” I whispered.</p> <p>He nodded, still smiling.</p> <p>“Is that better?”</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>“Do you want my ass?” I repeated.</p> <p>He groaned, his hips starting to gyrate as I moved over his hard cock.</p> <p>I started to move slowly, my hips grinding over him as he moaned again. I felt his body move as I moved my body over his, then, I reached behind and slowly pulled my pussy off to the side. He was so turned on.</p> <p>I looked at him in the mirror.</p> <p>“I want you to fuck my ass.”</p> <p>He took a step back.</p> <p>“It's okay.” I whispered, then slid forward on the bed and pulled him to me.</p> <p>“Oh, god yes.” he said.</p> <p>I smiled as I kissed him softly, my tongue playing in his mouth. I could tell he wasn't really expecting this, but it was all I could do to stop myself from wanting to hurt him. I couldn't help it. This was what I liked, what I wanted - to have someone I could trust be gentle, and for me to be willing to take this as a gift - and to let him have his wish - it was all that held me back. I closed my eyes and kissed him gently, then pulled him to me completely, moaning—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
