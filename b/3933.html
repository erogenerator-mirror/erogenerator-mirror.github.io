She said, trying to come to her senses. "I thought it was so hard not to show you like this—because I have to be careful." She said.</p> <p>I saw her nipples starting to peak through her bikini top. "Oh, yeah," I said, as my cock began to throb. "You look so fucking hot. You could make any guy fuck you. So fucking sexy!"</p> <p>I'm sure she didn't take it at first because she stood there, staring at me, before she slowly undid the top of her bikini. "Oh, god," she said, as she pulled it slowly off, revealing her tits. "I was so turned on by seeing those." She said. "And not just from me being hard and throbbing against this cock. From it—you know."</p> <p>"Mmm." I said, getting myself more comfortable. "I think I'm just about ready to go again—that's how hard you're got me."</p> <p>She reached down and gently lifted me off the bench, before sliding onto it, with me on top. As soon as she had me in place, she pulled the bikini bottoms apart and then her bare pussy lips were on me. I felt all of her warm, moist flesh envelope my cock, as it throbbed and throbbed. She moved her hips to take the friction deeper. It felt incredible. And she had a really tight pussy.</p> <p>"You're so wet." I said. "I didn't even think about you this morning."</p> <p>"We shouldn't, we shouldn't." She said. "We should get out of here before we make any noise."</p> <p>"Oh, c'mon!" I replied. "Let's get out!"</p> <p>"Come on. Let's get away from this place."</p> <p>I started to pull my shorts off, just as they were about to fly right up in the air. "We can't do that." I said.</p> <p>"Why not? When we get back to college we'll be back in the same clothes. So, come on...fuck me!"</p> <p>I looked around the bathroom at all the windows. The light from the street lights was bathing the interior of the bathroom. "It just doesn't feel right to be fucking you while the lights are on." I argued.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!" She said. "Take it, I'm going to let you." She slid off the toilet and grabbed the KY jelly and spread it out on the counter. "I'm never so wet." She said as her fingers spread the jelly all around her lips and clit, before sliding two fingers inside her and moving it in and out. "Oh, yes!" she said.</p> <p>I was starting to lose control now. "You're so gorgeous. You know just how to do this—"</p> <p>"I love sex." She said, before sliding her thumb into her slit as two fingers slipped out of her. "It's just so sexy, being so wet, and the feel of your cock. I love feeling that. It is just the most wonderful feeling a woman feels." I was getting even more aroused, as it was. "I really must tell you—I'm not really an old man. I've been married now for a few years—that's a lot of years...now I can't just cum in my wife. But, you know..."</p> <p>"Hurry!" I said. "Just hurry." With that a long, slow plunge, I plunged inside her, and the feeling of my cock in her pussy, just sent me right over the edge.</p> <p>She smiled at me. "Oh, honey! That was good! Now, if you'll just take care of my clit, it's only like right when I cum again. I can get right up to your orgasm right away." She said as she reached into the bowl of her bikini top and pulled on her nipples.</p> <p>She leaned back against me, as my cock slowly slipped out of her. "So amazing" she said. "What do you think—if you are ever in a position like this, you could do it right—right here?"</p> <p>"Oh, c'mon. I won't tell a soul." I said, as I rolled to my side, and slid under her. "I just want to be with you right now. Let's just enjoy the moment, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay. I suppose." She said. "Let's do it." She said, as she reached back down to her pussy and fingered herself with one finger.</p> <p>"There. That wasn't so dirty, was it?" I said, as I slid to my back beside her.</p> <p>"No." She said.
