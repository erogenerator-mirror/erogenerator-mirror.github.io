"You know it's not right!" she snickered. "I would have thought everyone would have noticed the fact that their kids lived here."</p> <p>"True," I agreed. "And it sounds like there are more places than I care to remember."</p> <p>"I'm not saying that it's always right," my wife replied. "As long as I'm here and all that's left for me is to wait. You can still go to bed here."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. Instead, I just laid there waiting for the inevitable knock at the door. My erection wasn't going away anytime soon, and I was not going to complain if they were in the house with me. I was really just hoping they didn't hear us in the doorway.</p> <p>It wasn't long before the knock came, and I just knew that I would have to go. I really wanted to spend the night upstairs, but had no real desire to be seen in this room naked with my cock inside one of these sexy sisters' pussies. Not only were all my fantasies fulfilled, but the excitement of going to bed in my wife's bed with my wife's big tits covered in their pussies all over me was only adding to my excitement. I guess the thought of that was what really got me going.</p> <p>It was a couple of minutes before the knock at the door took place and I wondered if I should answer it, but decided against it until I heard the front door open. There they were, wearing T-shirt and shorts and had their arms wrapped around each other. All around them, my wife's big sister seemed to be making love. Then she heard the sound of the latch turning, but not before she whispered to me, "It's alright, sweetheart. Mom and Dad will hear us, and they are right upstairs."</p> <p>That was enough for me, so I got up to answer the door and see what had occurred to them. I got my first real real look at the two of them. They were looking right at me and laughing hysterically. My wife was on one side of Jack and his wife was on the other. They were both wearing shorts and T-shirts and had their hand up each other's shirts while I was trying to get my eyes on the action. I had a pretty good idea what Jack and my wife were up to now. Either their eyes or their fingers or the shorts were rubbing each other while they pretended to be asleep.</p> <p>The girls' faces were turning red and my own were getting red again. As I was peeking through the doorway, I tried to imagine what they were saying, but it was hard to pretend that anything could get my attention.</p> <p>I finally figured out that my wife didn't know that I was there, so I just said, "Hello. I'm sorry I didn't think to interrupt your fun, but I really am just dying to see what you two are doing. Maybe we should go downstairs since we haven't had anything for dinner for a while."</p> <p>"No, we don't have anything," my wife stammered. "You have to see this. Oh, I can't wait until you leave."</p> <p>"No problem, sweetheart," I replied. "As always, let me at your back so that I can look at it." As soon as I said it, I knew that they were both going to look at me. I could hear their breathing becoming heavier and the sound of their chests moving in concert as they rubbed their asses in my direction.</p> <p>So with that, I slowly moved my way through the door and saw the two of them, one with her top up and the other sitting in a chair facing each other. For a moment I thought they were going to kiss each other, but that was a stupid idea at that point. Their mouths and lips didn't even touch, except for a soft peck each time they made contact.</p> <p>My wife and Jack looked at each other and laughed and smiled at something. Then my brother, who was talking to my other sister, smiled at what my wife's friend was doing.</p> <p>"You know, Mom has told me all these years that you don't have a very nice wife! It took me a long time to realize it! She would have told you to put on a suit and tie and meet us downstairs if she had. Now look at her! You are going to love her!</p> <p>"What's the matter, Mom," I asked. "Aren't you going to goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
