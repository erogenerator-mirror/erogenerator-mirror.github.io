"Come with me," she said simply. "I can't wait to sit in your lap and hold you."</p> <p>I was surprised at what she had been talking about. I still saw her as my sister but now I saw she had become much closer to Beth while she talked. I wondered if she recognized me; she may have even made fun of me. I decided I would be patient and follow my own lead.</p> <p></p> <p>In the next few weeks, Beth and I discussed the situation. Beth and I found out we had really had a good time, and that neither of us could remember the exact time and place except for the time we spent at the cabin together as a family at our parent's cabin. We didn't mention that our parents had seen us together as friends the previous week and that Beth and I had been seeing each other. However, neither of us ever mentioned that we had come to love it. In the end, we decided it would be best to wait, however long. We decided to go for a swim and enjoy the morning.</p> <p>Beth's plan was to be out the other day, but she decided she wanted to swim in the nude, since I hadn't been that good to her in the past. We walked up to the pool, which is about ten yards from the door, and I was surprised to see that she had stripped the bottom of her bathing suit right there in the water. When we entered the pool, I quickly followed, but when I got to the middle of the pool, Beth said she wanted to sit on the steps so nobody could get in between us. I climbed over the edge, and lay down in the deep end. I don't know how many times I had seen Beth naked before, but I guess she had changed her mind as we were swimming in there.</p> <p>As she climbed over the steps, I thought momentarily about what Beth had said about needing to sit on the steps, but I decided to just do it slowly and enjoy the sensation of water on my skin. She moved over in the same manner that I had previously and after a few seconds of just floating against the side of the pool, she turned around, so that my back was facing her feet. She spread her arms and leaned back against one of the steps, which caused her to place her hands down between her legs, allowing me to look at the area between her legs. She looked at me coyly and said, "Do you see any reason to get up?" I was feeling kind of self-conscious, but I didn't really know how to answer. After all, I was standing in the middle of the pool, only two feet away but far from it; I knew it was obvious. My dick was still stiff and standing proudly in the middle of the pool, which made all my previous thoughts of being naked outside of the bedroom in the next room seem less important.</p> <p></p> <p>Slowly, Beth rose, looking a little unsteady from the water, making it difficult to keep up. We both went to the pool steps, each of us standing just a little too far from the other, each of us with just the smallest amount of fabric on, only just covering us. When we reached the surface once again, we both slid into the water, spluttered a couple of times, then slid again. We had splashed around a few times so we were both soaking wet.</p> <p>Beth's nipples were already hard as I looked her up and down. However, she didn't seem to mind though, since I could see that her legs were soaked from the heat of the water, and her pubic area was also damp. The water was cooling down nicely, leaving only a thin film which served more to protect her nipples. She turned to lean back against the steps, and I leaned on one arm to watch her. After a couple of minutes, I raised the bar a couple of inches, which made my hard dick strain against my trunks with every step. I did this a couple of more times, watching Beth from afar as she tried to balance us slightly against the steps. With each step, Beth took a little more of me into her chest, allowing one of her fingers to slide down, across the head of my dick to the base, where she began to knead it for a brief moment before turning her attention to my eyes, again. I could see that she was a little embarrassed, but when the top of her head brushed against mine, I was suddenly very aware of where her breasts were. Her nipple and areolae were pushing into my palm, causing a slight vibration through my fingers as I caressed them in sync with the motion of our hands. I was looking at her legs becauseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
