She said.</p> <p>He reached up and wrapped his arms around her and she slowly wrapped her arms around him in return.</p> <p>They kissed like that for some time.</p> <p>"You can touch me. I want to tell you what I want you to do to me." Katie said, and he did, and that was all that came out of her mouth.</p> <p>"I think I want you to give me a really nice massage." She said.</p> <p>"What you really want me to do is to turn you on." He said, and she didn't say anything, but put her legs up on his.</p> <p>"I want you to make me hard, Daddy." She said.</p> <p>"It's only fair." He said, and kissed her hard.</p> <p>He didn't give her much thought for a second about what to do, and she kissed him again.</p> <p>"I want you to do all of me." She said.</p> <p>"Well there's only so much that goes into giving. How far can I take that then?" He smiled.</p> <p>"I think so." She said. He had no idea that she would go this far, but he was still happy to have her.</p> <p>He kissed her on the forehead and said, "I love you mom." She put her arms around his neck, and he wrapped his arms around her back.</p> <p>"I love you too." She said, pulling back from him and looking in his eyes. She wanted him to make love to her. This was the only way she was going to give it her heart.</p> <p>"Momma is dead." He said, laughing a little bit. "I think a good time is had by all, as momma." And he smiled.</p> <p>"That sounds good to me, too." She said, and pulled her on top of him. They held each other very close now.</p> <p>"Is it ok if momma makes love?" He asked softly.</p> <p>"No, I would prefer that you fuck me, if that's what you want." She said, giving him a kiss all along his jaw area, down to his ear, then back up, to his lips. "It doesn't bother me a bit either. And I'm sure you do too."</p> <p>He knew what she meant. He just wanted to make sure. He knew the feeling of her naked body underneath him was very intense. But, if he wanted to stay there and make love to her forever, then it would be ok if she did. It was his choice.</p> <p>They looked each other in the eyes for a moment, before turning their heads to face each other. Now he could see that she was not upset, but really turned on by the thought of him fucking her while she looked at him and thought of him fucking her. She smiled a bit at that thought, and then leaned in to kiss him again.</p> <p>"Now you're even with momma, if that's what you want." She smiled.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" He asked.</p> <p>"I mean, you're getting closer to momma, too."</p> <p>"What, exactly?" He asked, as her pussy started to slide up and down his cock.</p> <p>"She's going to feel good too."</p> <p>"I don't know what I mean exactly, or how it can be different. What I'm saying to you is that if you're not careful if that is what you REALLY want."</p> <p>"Oh, oh, that's so sweet." He said, as he lifted his hands and put them on her breasts, feeling them in his hands for a while, as they squeezed together.</p> <p>And then he lowered his head to her tits and started to lick and suck on them. It felt so good, in his arms, so soft and warm with her body. He kept on thinking about it for the next ten, forty minutes until suddenly she pushed off of him and put her head and shoulders on the bed, and her hands on his, still wrapped around his waist.</p> <p>"I can't." She said, and he put his hands back to her.</p> <p>"No, you can't, and neither is going to. I love holding you like this. I feel so sexy with you, with everything else in the world. You don't have to be so gentle with me." She said, and he began to do what she wanted, because there was nothing like it, in his life. Not that he knew what to do with a girl, but it was definitely something he would never forget.</p> <p>"If you want it, I want it." He said.</p> <p>"Mmmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
