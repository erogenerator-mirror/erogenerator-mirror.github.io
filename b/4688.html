He groaned out loud. She stopped sucking with it inside her and she licked at his balls. They were full of semen! They had just been shot as he pounded her against the wall of the bathroom.</p> <p>The last moan he made was when he reached an orgasm of his own in her mouth, and he came in her mouth with a loud roar.</p> <p>He helped her up, and she put down her dress. It was still up and in the bathroom, but she pulled it back down, and he saw that the two of them had covered it. They had been a bit careless at first, but as he had helped her out, and told her her dress was safe it felt good.</p> <p>She had said that there was no reason to do anything that she and George could not have. She had said only she wanted to be safe. Hadn't she.</p> <p>"And I would like it if someone did this to you," he said to her.</p> <p>"I don't want anyone to do this. And that includes me," she said.</p> <p>"You said we could take it a little farther."</p> <p>"But that's what I don't want to happen, is it?"</p> <p>"Not the idea, you bastard. I know its going to be really awkward."</p> <p>And she had just laughed.</p> <p>"No, what idea is that? I don't have any choice," she had said.</p> <p>"I know. Well, what you have planned for me will be even worse to you," he said. "Are there any limits?"</p> <p>"No. We are going to be a bit daring this summer if we keep this up."</p> <p>"What, me and George?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well, I have to admit, I haven't ever touched another guy in any way, let alone another person. I've kind of been looking for someone for the past twelve weeks. And I know it's probably only been in a couple of weeks, but then I'm back to my job. How do I find anyone in my class?"</p> <p>"We can have a bit of fun," he said, "or you can just go home and forget all about it, and you can always use me to get even with those who said they might not."</p> <p>She looked at him and saw a smirk on his face.</p> <p>***</p> <p>George had said that it was OK to do things like that, and then asked her if she would ever do anything that she or one of her friends did that they didn't like.</p> <p>"So, are you sure about anything?" he asked. "After all, I'm going to have to tell you that it is a lot of stuff."</p> <p>She had laughed. "Don't worry about that. I already had fun anyway. In a way, it was a bit exciting for me too," she said. "I got a thrill for being in a whole new way. I got to feel the things that I wanted back then," she added.</p> <p>"Then it's just as good to be back at that. And that's where you get the idea that George was trying to force you to. He might have taken something back with him, but he didn't take anything back at that point. Maybe he was just trying to change the topic," she said. "And if he thought he could come between you, he should have, but...that wasn't what happened. And it's just as well for me. I feel so free, it's hard to hold on to all of my boyfriends and everything."</p> <p>"So, is that what you just said?" he asked, still trying to find out what kind of secret she really was talking about.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess so. At least now I know," she said with a little laugh.</p> <p>"So just do it. You know I trust you. There really is no harm in that."</p> <p>He kissed her cheek, leaned over and kissed her for the first time and she kissed him back. He got to kiss her and fondle her breasts through her clothes. It was very hard to not think about the feeling of that hand on her breast as they were being kissed and it felt so nice.</p> <p>She felt it and let her leg fall open for him and he got to touch her crotch.</p> <p>"Wow! Now that's what I call an orgasm, George," she whispered into his ear. "I didn't know that about the guy in the movies. And you didn't let me get close enough, yet."</p> <p>"I'm going to get in there and we'll talk a lot when we've been done with it," George whispered to her.
