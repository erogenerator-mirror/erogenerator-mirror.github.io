'And I'm sure the doctor's going to be very pleased by this'.</p> <p>'You'd be very disappointed if you couldn't help it,' she said, squeezing my leg. 'I've read all about it. And it's not as bad as you think it is. But I'm just thinking the doctor's not going to appreciate the view.'</p> <p>'Thank you,' I said, squeezing my leg again.</p> <p>'So you didn't have an orgasm?</p> <p>'Nope,' I replied, 'I've only had two. Not good enough to do anything at all.'</p> <p>'That's a shame,' she said, squeezing my leg again. 'How was it?'</p> <p>'Well, it was good, really' I said. 'I could tell I went in all the way down to that. And I didn't cum at all. That's a pity. But it was a lot better than I ever remember. And there's some more.'</p> <p>She smiled and squeezed me again. 'And what's that?'</p> <p>'Well, I think I found a couple of things I think I may have missed.'</p> <p>She smiled at me as we headed back to my place. And then we started kissing again, our tongues dancing together. It wasn't so bad after all.</p> <p>*******</p> <p>I was feeling good again. I was getting more involved and feeling more comfortable with my boyfriend than ever before. I loved kissing him and I loved it when we made love together. And I enjoyed kissing him so, despite my feelings for him, when he said I should kiss him, even if we were actually making love, I agreed.</p> <p>'Let's go and get our food' I said, turning back to my bag and getting my laptop and a snack.</p> <p>I put what I had in my bag onto the top of the picnic table and sat on the same end as the one my parents are in, and I sat down and opened one of the menus I had on it. I grabbed two bowls out of the kitchen and we all sat down together on the picnic bench, where mom and dad had the table. And mom and I sat on the bench, her head resting against my thigh and my boyfriend's head resting in hers. It didn't take long for mom and I to start chatting and having several drinks in our wine glasses.</p> <p>It didn't take long before everyone was drinking. After a couple of glasses we all started enjoying it again and we started to chat about the weather, people just starting to get to their good selves and just starting enjoying ourselves. I loved it when mom went on a bit of a potty-choccy story where dad was talking about the weather and where mom and me were playing the role of sun-tea-guy and mom was giving him a kiss. It was a beautiful sight and I was glad I had done that just a month before, so I knew it would be a wonderful experience for both of us.</p> <p>At one point when mom and dad had finished their beer and mom had a couple more to drink, I asked dad if I could kiss mom. Without thinking he had asked me to, so we both started to kiss each other and, as my boyfriend and me continued to kiss we moved over so that we were now lying on the grass.</p> <p>I started to kiss mom's neck and my hand slid under her blouse and caressed her breasts as her lips slowly lowered until our noses touched. She tasted so sweet. I moved my tongue out so that she could kiss it. And she opened her lips wide, taking my tongue inside them. We moaned at the taste of each other's lips and tongue. It was a wonderful new feeling. It was different from the kissing we had the last time we were alone with each other. Different, but still wonderful.</p> <p>I broke the kiss and said, 'Mom, honey, I really mean it.' And then I was kissing her again. I could feel her tongue exploring mine as we kissed, the excitement she'd just experienced, the sensations I had just experienced, the feel of her lips and tongue, and the taste and smell of her body. We kissed and caressed and fondled each other for a long time. It was such an amazing feeling to kiss another person and to be kissing her like that.</p> <p>It didn't take long for mom to become aroused. My boyfriend was lying beside us and between us. We could see his hand under mom's blouse. His hand slid under her blouse and onto her breast.</p> <p>'Ooh darling!' I said,' what about dad?'</p> <p>'Not a problem honey. Just kiss me and caress me. Just make me feel good and to feel good,' she said breathily.</p> <p>Dad was beside us and kissing mom and I and our mouths were exploring each other.
