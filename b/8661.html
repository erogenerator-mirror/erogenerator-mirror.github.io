Mr. Miller asked cheerfully, pulling out a chair and taking his seat. When they were both seated, he gave me the first of a series of instructions. "Get into the kitchen, put your shoes on my favorite chair, and sit down."</p> <p>I did as told, sitting in the chair in the usual position. While I was doing that I looked around to try to locate their secret. I spotted several boxes, and one of them contained a pair of worn panties. I quickly took them out, placing them under the armrest of the chair. I then heard a zipper coming down. Opening the drawer, I pulled out three more pairs, before returning to the chair. Looking at the remaining items in the drawer, I pulled a pair of panties out, and slid them back into the drawer, only to find Mr. Miller standing in the doorway with a bottle of scented body oil in his hand. I looked up in puzzlement.</p> <p>"You need a little help?" he asked. I nodded, hoping so. He began pouring the oil into a palm to be spread over my upper back and shoulders, before rubbing it over the area where my shirt had been cut off. I jumped at the feel of the oil on my skin, before he began slowly rubbing some behind each shoulder, and down my spine, causing my muscles to tingle and to tighten involuntarily. By the time he had finished, my upper body was glistening with sweat. I took a deep breath, trying to relax my muscles. I was aware of several people in the lounge outside the door, including Mr. Miller. Even so, I couldn't help myself, I felt my panties growing damp with desire, and I knew I was going to need to turn to the bathroom.</p> <p>He continued working up my back, the muscles in my lower back tightening. He moved to my breasts, which were still rising and falling with my deep breaths. He reached under my arms to apply more body oil in the opposite direction, before rubbing the oil onto my breasts, rubbing in his fingers. I looked down between my legs, past my nipples. I felt a burning need rising within me, and I knew I may as well make the next move. I slowly slid down to the carpeted floor. Mr. Miller then moved forward, bending down, his body nearly touching mine. I felt his breath and the cool feeling of his arms as he rubbed my neck. I smiled at him as though pleased, and leaned down toward him, kissing him softly there.</p> <p>"You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen..." he said softly. I turned back to him, looking into his eyes.</p> <p>"Thank you Mr. Miller," I replied, smiling shyly.</p> <p>He smiled back and stood up, lifting my face to kiss me once again.</p> <p>"You can turn around if you like, sir." I turned my back to him, and he walked toward the bath. I felt his hands begin working at the buttons of my blouse on the way out, and watched as he leaned over, his hands slowly sliding down my chest and over my stomach. I wanted him badly, just as much as I did right then. Without realizing it, I had been moving my hips, rubbing against his lap. He slid a hand beneath the robe to cup my breast, massaging and squeezing it through the fabric of my bra and my shirt. He leaned down to suckle my nipple, biting and licking it as he did.</p> <p>"Oh, Mr. Miller..." I whispered, my eyes closed. "I've needed this." I leaned back against his thighs, my breasts still pressed back to him. He smiled up at me, his face still glistening in the dim light of the room.</p> <p>"Yes, your body is my gift to you, little one." My hand reached up to caress his cheek, and I felt the muscles in his jaw, as he moved his lips away from mine. "Is this your first experience of a night's work?" he asked. Without answering, I felt an erection begin to stir against my thigh.</p> <p>"Uh, huh," I mumbled, not trusting myself to speak.</p> <p>Mr. Miller slid his hands under my shirt and lifted it off my shoulders. I felt his erection pressing against my thigh, and I shifted to allow it to move along side of his.</p> <p>"It's time now for you to experience your first pussy." Mr. Miller whispered as he slid off of the couch. I followed along behind as I walked into what had to be the largest bedroom I had ever been in. It felt like the size of their biggest bed.</p> <p>"It's nice, isn't it?" Mr. Miller said, as he reached into a drawer and pulled out a strap-on.</p> <p>"Yes," I quickly lied.</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
