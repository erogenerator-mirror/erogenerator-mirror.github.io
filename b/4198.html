I don't know how much longer I can hold on. My fingers dig into the mattress as one long thick toe flexes. I start to moan and I think I'm going to faint down there.</p> <p>"Nuh huhhhh." The woman says.</p> <p>I feel her feet tighten and her legs begin to flex outward. I let out a long deep moan.</p> <p>"Noooooooooooooooooooo!" I say out loud.</p> <p>The other foot flexes and her legs flex outward. Her leg muscles twitched and released. Her legs flex and flex outward. My hands move instinctively to my sides and back to my shoulders. My body jerks and my back arch. She raises one foot higher and the other foot drops to the mattress. Her feet flex and flex outward.</p> <p>"Nooooooooo!" I scream out loud.</p> <p>The woman begins to squirm forward.</p> <p>"Nooooooo!!!!" She says.</p> <p>Her feet flex several more times. She shakes them around and up and down. Her calves twitch and flex upward.</p> <p>"Nooooooooo!!!!!!" I scream out.</p> <p>A deep growl from behind me, followed by the feel of my hips pressing forward on the bed as my body pushes away from all motion. My hips flex up and down while my body pushes upward with each flex. Her legs twitch and flex upward. The feet flex and flex outward before her feet flex inward.</p> <p>"Nooo!!!!" I say.</p> <p>The woman's legs flex and flex outward as my body flexes.</p> <p>I try to rise up and push off but I'm not strong enough. The woman's toes flex outward. Her feet flex inward. The foot flex outward. The foot flex inward. I can feel the heel of her foot flex downward. The tip of her foot flex downward then outward. I can feel my lower back arch and my back arch push outward on her leg. Again I begin to move my hips back toward my hips on her foot.</p> <p>"Noooooooooo!!!!" I scream out loud.</p> <p>The other foot flex downward. My back arches and my lower back arches. One of the feet flex and flex outward so my lower body arches on her foot. My lower back arch flex upward. My lower back arches upward and my lower back arch outward. My lower back arches upward. My lower back arch outward. My lower back arches upward. My lower back arches inward and inward. My lower back arch outward.</p> <p>I feel her foot flex inward. The top of her foot flex downward as her toes flex inward. The other foot flex downward as my lower back arches inward. My lower back arch upward and outward. I feel my lower back arch outward.</p> <p>"Noooooooooooooo!!" I yell out loud. "Nooooooo."</p> <p>I continue to pant.</p> <p>"Nooooooo!!!!" I yell again.</p> <p>She begins to flex her feet outward again. My lower back arch upward. I begin to groan in sheer pleasure.</p> <p>"Nooooo." I say in a soft moan.</p> <p>I feel the bottom of my spine start to flex outward. It starts as a long thin finger flex outward with each flex upward. A long finger flex upward with each flex downward.</p> <p>"Noooooooo!!!!!" I shout.</p> <p>My lower back arch outward. My lower back arch upward. My lower back arch outward. I feel my lower back flex downward as one of my feet flex outward. My lower back arch upward. My lower back arch outward. It is a long wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly</p> <p>My feet flex and flex downward. My lower back arch upward. My lower back arch upward. My lower back arch upward. My lower back arch upward and inward. I begin to shake and wiggle downward. I let out a loud groan. My lower back arch outward and my lower back arch downward. My lower back arch upward. The upper back arches outward. My lower back arch outward. I begin to shake and wiggle downward. My lower back arch upward. My lower back arch upward. I begin to sway downward and outward. I begin to wiggle downward and outward. I begin to shake downward and outward.</p> <p>"Nooooooo!!!!" I yell out loud.</p> <p>I can feel my lower back arch outwardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
