I had to tell you!" she said as she climbed up the stairs of the apartment building.</p> <p>"What is it that she loves so much? " John wanted to know.</p> <p>"She is my life," Bethany replied.</p> <p>"I'll see if I can get you to help in there," John offered.</p> <p>"I have an appointment," Bethany responded with a smile.</p> <p>Bethany knew the answer but just had to know what "it" was.</p> <p>"I have an idea to use you on your first trial and it might help you with that," Bethany stated.</p> <p>"I'll have to ask you where," John replied.</p> <p>After the trial Bethany felt that John had the confidence in the situation. The idea that he could help her as it was was a big step for her and for her he was the one who had already gone through the process.</p> <p>"That will be something," John thought to himself.</p> <p>On Monday, after his day off, John was in the office on Monday morning when Bethany knocked on the door of the attorney's office. He answered the door and was surprised to see this vision of loveliness walking around the small manor.</p> <p>"Come in, Mr. Roberts. I see that Bethany is doing well in this trial," Bethany said.</p> <p>"Please sit down," John said in a kindly tone of voice and then started to pull his chair out from the desk.</p> <p>Bethany was standing behind John as she watched him sit.</p> <p>"Mr. Roberts, are you sure you have not taken a vacation or something?" Bethany asked</p> <p>"Sure, that must not be an option, just an employee of mine working in the office," John said and then added, "Please sit down and let me tell you that I have a friend who is doing my case for me.</p> <p>Bethany smiled at that. "It takes a lot of time to get a client client and it does a lot of paperwork, so don't take too long to change the subject."</p> <p>Bethany was standing next to John and had her hands resting on his shoulders. He was tall and she was shorter than she already was.</p> <p>"Mr. Roberts is Bethany's client as she is trying to get a referral to another attorney. She has told me lots of stories about this firm," Bethany said as she looked at John.</p> <p>"This firm is very successful in representing the firm that does your case," Bethany responded as she touched John's shoulder with her thumb.</p> <p>"How do you know her name? Is she actually your girlfriend?" John asked. "Is she married?" as she slid to her knees and knelt down next to him.</p> <p>"Oh, she met my first girlfriend when she was in college in Boston. She is also the woman that I am trying to get a case. And since the firm is so successful, I have asked her to do some work for me in the firm so that I don't lose clients."</p> <p>"Now I also know about you. I have met your client name and she is very successful," Bethany said as she slipped her right hand under Johns robe and grabbed his half erect cock.</p> <p>"I can't believe how good she is!" John said as his fingers reached out to touch Bethany's left hand.</p> <p>John and Bethany had an understanding of each other. They had often felt a lot more in tune with each others' feelings and desires. Now that things might have gone a bit further, they both knew there would have to change their lives.</p> <p>"What are you talking about," John asked as he moved to the desk to take the papers from his hands.</p> <p>"This is all my client," Bethany replied as she handed John his papers.</p> <p>"I am sorry that I can't help you more," John said as his hands were all over Bethany's face.</p> <p>"If I can help you with this, then yes. I'm sure that we could work something out with the firm and then see where it would go from there," Bethany said with a smile on her face and said, "Do you still live in this great city?"</p> <p>"Yes, I live close by, but for one reason or another, I'm on vacation," John said as he led Bethany to the door.</p> <p>"Will that work out, John Roberts?" Bethany offered as she watched John.</p> <p>"Of course, I have to check out of town and be there for my court date and everything," John replied as he walked away from Bethany.</p> <p>He had been looking at Bethany almost everyday since they had metâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
