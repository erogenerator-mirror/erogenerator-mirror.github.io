It wasn't that I needed one at the moment. It was a bit like the other parts of the evening. While it gave her an opportunity for to run her hands along my body; it also gave me a chance for the most delightful feelings. Especially if she rubbed my breasts and crotch. I felt my excitement rising; I was very aroused by the thought of doing the opposite. As she leaned in to kiss me I pulled her in closer so she could feel my body and then let my hand find its way to her breasts. I slid my hand around and began to gently knead them, she let out a soft moaning sound and pressed closer into me. Her lips parted easily with our kiss and she brought a hand up to my breast and gently massaged it.</p> <p>"Do you want the wash?" she whispered. "Let me rinse your back so you don't get cold" Then her hand slid down my body and her fingers brushed lightly before they dipped between my thighs. I opened my legs to let her slide in and she was right behind the bath and we got very close. Her fingers lightly brushed my clitoris as she slid in and out from behind. It was such a turn on. My hands were at her sides and I held her as she slid back into the water. She then slid her hand up over my stomach and across my breasts. She massaged my breasts lightly and they began to swell up slightly.</p> <p>"It's really getting pretty warm in here, don't you think?" she asked. "Let me do the rest" and she pulled the bath curtain shut and stood back. We looked at each other. She turned around so that I could feel the heat of her body and then looked directly at me. "How about you?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Hmm, I guess so." I smiled as I reached forward to touch her back. I let my fingers trail down her spine to the very top of her ass and finally let them glide over her cheeks. She shivered slightly.</p> <p>After washing each other we got out the bath and we returned it to its proper place then washed each other. I started in slowly so she wouldn't run to the shower but when she finished I gently slipped her dress off of her body. She reached down and undid the buttons of my blouse which she unzipped and dropped it on the floor. It was only around her mid-thighs and left my body bare. When she slid it off I turned back. She slid down so she was level with my vagina, then she gently ran the tip of her hot tongue down along the lips of my vagina. The sensation of being eaten out turned me on and I closed my legs, making it easy for her. She slipped my panties down with one hand and then reached in for the soap.</p> <p>"I want to clean myself all over right now so you can put in me the washcloth to wash me and you can do my tits. I love to play with you so there is no point in pulling away." she purred as she lifted her wet body up and squatted over me. I took the washcloth and slid it along my body to soothe my body. She gently rubbed it up between my breasts and then up between them. She moved it down toward my belly and I felt the warmth as it brushed my breasts.</p> <p>"You really get so excited when you're being washed. I mean it makes it easier to go with you. I know it's a lot better with men having sex and then someone else doing it. It makes it easier to go with him." she said as she reached around me to wash my back. I continued washing her back so I could feel the strength of the muscles that had grown when we were younger. I was working up the nerve to slide my hands down her sides. My touch slipped the gown off her shoulders until my fingers were just touching those strong knots in her back. She let the cloth rub her body and slid her hands under the front straps as she turned me around.</p> <p>"I want you to lie down. I want to get you out of those clothes and you can lie down with me. I think you're sexy with a bit of weight on you." she said as she slid off of me and into the wet side of the tub. As I lay down on top of her she slid her body down so she was sitting on her back. I slid myself down so I came to rest between her legs. She began to lightly run circles along it, so that my clitoris was on the edge of her body. When she slid the washcloth up and down her slit I felt the warmth as she began a slight circular motion with her hips. She slipped the washcloth up over my breasts and I felt the washcloth press harder against them. As she slid it up and down Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
