I said and bent down.</p> <p>"I think you do." I replied. I took his cock in his right hand and slid my tongue up the underside of it, then put the head in my mouth and bobbed my head up and down on his cock, sliding it down my throat as his left hand gently began rubbing my back and my buttocks through my briefs. I felt the familiar tightening of his shaft in my mouth and the swelling of his cock in my mouth. He began running his fingers through my hair.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he whispered.</p> <p>"Take me to bed and fuck me." I answered.</p> <p>He began to kiss my neck and chest and down to my nipples, rolling the hardening points with his tongue on each down stroke. I felt the beginnings of his cock at the opening of my shorts.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I said. "Fuck me hard and fast and make me cum."</p> <p>"You are one hot little fucker, Jenny. Are you ready for some dick?" he whispered.</p> <p>His breathing became deep and slow, deep and slow, as I stroked his cock in and out of his hand. He moaned, "I'm getting close. Just a little harder."</p> <p>"Yeah, right there." I said, and continued to stroke his cock with my right hand as I watched and felt him slide my briefs aside, then slid two fingers into my vagina.</p> <p>"There. Feels good." he said, and I felt him slide his cock straight into me.</p> <p>I leaned forward and put a hand on his chest, and pulled his face to mine so we could kiss, our tongues caressing as his cock slipped fully into my soft body. I arched my back, and pushed my hips upwards to meet his stroke. "Mmm," I said. "I do feel good as you fuck me."</p> <p>"Ah. Fuck. I'm so close." he answered.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum and you're going to suck me off again. I can't hold back." So did he.</p> <p>"I'm cumming. Harder, please." I was going to suck his cock to completion if he would just let me go, but I wanted to taste him again.</p> <p>"Oh." He said as he kissed me and began kissing his way down to my neck. My breasts were warm in his hand, the nipples hard peaks on a taut, taut, smooth surface. When he reached my abdomen, he kissed the top of my shorts, and my belly, moving across the waistband of the panties and across my pubes, then down until he had kissed the crotch of my shorts.</p> <p>"I want to taste you again." I said, and reached down and took his cock in one hand, which he quickly released from my grasp. I took a moment to run my fingers across the tip of his cock as if testing the strength of it, and found the tiny vein on the underside of the helmet that began to stiffen as he took in my fingers' contact with his skin. He moved my fingers up and touched the wetness on the middle finger of my right hand. I could feel the wetness forming with my middle finger tip and slowly slid it in and out of my vagina, my other hand running through his hair, his hand cupping my breast, his mouth on me.</p> <p>"Yes." I said, "Yes. That feels good."</p> <p>"You taste wonderful," he said and kissed me tenderly, his hands caressing my body, my face, breasts, my neck, my ass. He moved his mouth up to touch my ears and kissed the soft hollow skin there, my shoulder and neck, then down to my breast. His mouth came to meet my nipple, and the hard nub was at the base of my breast, where the tip was hard, then I felt his tongue slide past it, then under the soft skin and finally into my nipple, touching it with his tongue, circling it.</p> <p>"That's the spot. Do you remember it?" he asked. I smiled. "I love those spots."</p> <p>"I want to do it one day. Will you be ready?" he asked.</p> <p>"Let me up a little, please." My shoulders were getting wobbly, but I managed to get up on my knees. He stood up again, and I was left holding his erect cock in a hand. The head was full and red, his body glistened in the morning sunlight. "Now let me up to your waist." I said. I lowered my head to the top of his left leg. He lifted his right leg and brought it around the outside of my shoulders. Then he placed his left hand on my back, and pushed me away.</p> <p>"Lay down on your back in the middle of theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
