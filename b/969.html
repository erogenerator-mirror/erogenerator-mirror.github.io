She did not stop until her orgasm started, then she lay there breathing hard, looking at the ceiling until I finally let her down and pulled her up toward me, kissing her deeply. We held each other until our breathing returned to normal, then I moved her over to the bed. I laid down beside her and said, "Now I know why my parents always come to my house, don't get me wrong, there are no secrets and I never think of it as being weird or disgusting or something."</p> <p>"I know exactly the feeling," she said, "it's the feeling that I have when you're in the way, even when you take your clothes off, and I know I love it."</p> <p>I kissed her softly, then added, "You know, there's one more thing we haven't shared yet."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah?" she said eagerly.</p> <p>"I'm a little worried about what we're going to do, but if we're going to act like a couple of old married people, I'm all ears."</p> <p>"I like it," she said, "you're a nice guy."</p> <p>"Aww, you're sweet, but the truth is, if you're worried about something, don't worry about trying to stop us, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," she said, then added, "But we might have to do this slowly and carefully before we do anything we're not all sure about. Do you know what I mean, 'if we have to'?"</p> <p>I chuckled softly as she blushed again, and said, "I'm not going to push us into anything we haven't already tried before, honey, and I'm sure in your case, the answer would be yes."</p> <p>"But...?" she asked uncertainly.</p> <p>I kissed her again, "Don't worry, my love. When there's someone around, nothing will be rushed."</p> <p>"Ooo... and just in case," she said, "my folks will be home at some point, and they'll be going down to the shops tonight. I'll be sitting on their sofa while they're here, so just come right up. Then we'll go back to the bedroom and wait while they talk with our folks."</p> <p>Sue began to laugh nervously, but I held her close and assured her that she wouldn't regret it. I told her how I expected to keep things as they were for a long time, before they all arrived. As I kissed her and let her go the rest of the way, letting her go, I felt a pang of sadness. I was worried about what I really felt about what our relationship was. Part of me wasn't sure if I was going to let her go, despite the fact that in that time there'd been little resistance or embarrassment in their initial meeting. I felt guilty at what my new bride was feeling. I wanted to make love to her, but we'd come to an agreement as to what that was going to be. We made love in quiet, loving ecstasy that lasted for a long time. It was obvious that she was trying to tell me the meaning of our relationship, not to force me into anything she was not willing to give up. We made love as a pair, without the pretense and fear of what might be expected. I knew she wanted to be a part of my life.</p> <p>I had come to realize, that the very idea of a relationship in a way I had never known or felt before made a profound difference in me at that instant. I could see it in what I did with my parents, if only on a level that was there in the way we were. I didn't get a chance to think until we had all gone to bed in our room, which we did after a few moments of silence, and then I was in her arms at the sight of her. She cried softly, which was unusual for her, I thought. She cried for a long time before she calmed down. I held her tightly until she was fully recovered, then we turned to kiss or hold hands.</p> <p>I felt her hand slowly begin to slip into the waistband of my boxer shorts and her fingers began to stroke my throbbing cock. She smiled when I told her to get naked, and her expression told me that she was as eager as I was. We lay on the bed together for a long time, until she could no longer take the gentle stroking of my cock. We were so turned on we fell asleep and dreamlessly that we didn't wake for several hours. Sue woke me at some point and told me, "I've got to take a shower, so will you come with me."</p> <p>We walked slowly down the hall and I was surprised to see my parents waiting on them as I came to their room. I smiled at them as we approached, saying, "Mom, Dadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
