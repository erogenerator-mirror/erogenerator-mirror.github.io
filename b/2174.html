"You are one lucky sonneteer." She said sarcastically, "I'll take that as a compliment."</p> <p>"I think." She smirked. "You two have a good time this evening. We should talk on the way home."</p> <p>She leaned over so that she could kiss her and said, "I might even agree."</p> <p>They kissed for a while and as they did their arms were around each other. Kara had her face in of Scott's neck and her lips were tantalizingly close to his ear. He could smell her perfume that made him feel warm and tingly between his own legs.</p> <p>When they had finished kissing Scott said, "Well, I need to get to work. I'll catch you later."</p> <p>With that he walked off and headed for his office.</p> <p>Kara was in her car. The light on the parking lot seemed warm but she really had no idea that such a nice day would be like it was. As she pulled into the entrance of her parking spot she was suddenly aware of the sound of the garage door opening. It was Scott walking toward her with a warm smile on his face. She reached over and gave him a smile too.</p> <p>Then she remembered her promise to him. She looked back at the garage. He had already parked in her lot and she felt a slight pang of guilt. When he turned to walk back towards her she was already getting out of her car.</p> <p>"Okay." Was all she could say to him. Then she walked into the garage as if she were on a mission not to be disturbed.</p> <p>Scott was already stepping up to her at the end of the long row of hooks and rings in the back. He put one arm around her shoulders and one hand gently massaging the side of one of her small breasts. Kara couldn't believe the feeling of his hand caressing and teasing her there and her body responded in kind. She leaned back against his shoulder and let him continue his massage.</p> <p>She felt very comfortable. The only thing she really cared about was that it was him touching her there.</p> <p>Kara let her own hands slip under the loose neckline of her dress to caress the side of her breast and then down over the swell of her breast. She leaned back against him when his hand slid lower to softly caress the inside of her upper thigh. The feeling was electric and she pushed her crotch against his hardness. She really didn't need to hear how excited he was to know she was aroused. She just let him continue pleasuring her, letting him do things that she didn't want.</p> <p>Scott gently moved her down a row of hook and rings just as he had done earlier. He let her slide down to the end of the long row of hooks and rings. When she could feel the soft down of his pants he stepped back as she leaned against the arm that he had draped around her.</p> <p>Kara leaned against it herself. The sound of a door closing was just like the sound of her heart was pounding in her chest.</p> <p>"It won't take long now". Scott's voice was almost a whisper.</p> <p>Scott moved towards her. It was a soft, almost sensual way to greet her. If he was going to be gentle with her, he wasn't going to go soft on her as the elevator arrived and the men in it were arriving. So as they neared the car Scott took her in his arms and kissed her fully on the lips. As their lips met they both took control. It seemed almost as if he was turning her on even more than he was.</p> <p>Kara felt him caress her breasts through her dress and bra. He did that to a point that if he pulled the strap or the fabric back on it she could feel it being pulled downward.</p> <p>Kara was enjoying the caresses of this man but she was in a way even more turned on as he felt her body responding to the hands that were caressing her breasts.</p> <p>She felt one of his hands slip beneath the waistband of her skirt and then back up to the top edge of her panties.</p> <p>Suddenly he raised his head and whispered, "Let's hurry!"</p> <p>His voice was sexy, as if he was just thinking about the world. And he wanted to hear her say it.</p> <p>Kara let out an excited gasp as he touched her right where his fingers had just been. She felt a tingle of excitement as the sensation of his gentle hands caressing her body sent a new wave of feelings through her body. She felt her body react to him, so many ways, as if that man in her dreams was here holding her as it would seem to happen.</p> <p>"Scott." she whispered.</p> <p>She felt his hand slide under her panties and feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
