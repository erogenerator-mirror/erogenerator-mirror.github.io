He looked over her naked body at me and smiled.</p> <p>"Yes... fuck me." She said.</p> <p>"That's better." He leaned over her body and kissed her lips, his hands were now running the length of her arm and arm as he kissed her mouth. She felt it as his tongue worked her tongue, she could only do the same to him, but to him it felt good.</p> <p>"Mmphk!"</p> <p>Her eyes closed as she felt him enter her. She knew she was in trouble already, but for a moment she felt an unforced desire, a longing that made her head swoon. It was her own.</p> <p>"Fuck me." She heard herself say.</p> <p>"You have a name, my girlfriend?" He queried.</p> <p>"A name!" She said, her body was trembling as she thought to herself "a name."</p> <p>He chuckled. "I love your name, baby." He said.</p> <p>"Please do." She said.</p> <p>She lay there, letting all the thoughts and fantasies of these three months go, she could just be with him all day.</p> <p>"Come on, turn over." He said, pulling her gently to her feet with his hands and helping her dress. As she stood there, she felt him caress her breasts, her nipples stiffening. He ran the tips of his fingers over her breasts teasing her body as he kissed her lips. She felt his hands slide down her waist to the top of her black panties. She felt him pull the elastic, his finger ran up and down her slit, stopping in front of her slit. "I love what you're wearing." He said, his words teasing her and making her wet.</p> <p>"No... you can't." She replied, as he pulled her panties down, she lifted her bottom and he pulled them back up. She could feel his breath, in her pussy and pussy lips.</p> <p>"Are you alright with this?" She said.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm fine, but we still have much to do."</p> <p>"What are we going to do?"</p> <p>"I'd like to do exactly that, I'd like to get fucked really hard, not just you."</p> <p>He kissed her again, his tongue probing her mouth as he pulled her legs apart and started to run his finger around her clit. He knew how to drive her insane she would not last, but he too felt that if he let her enjoy that for a few moments of play he could get her into anything.</p> <p>"Fuck me." She said.</p> <p>"No, what I mean, what happens here, if we do this you have to be tied up and will not be able to run away, there is no stopping them."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"If you were in the room, we could tie your hands and you can have a great time, but you must always be naked and tied up."</p> <p>"There will be no safe word." She replied.</p> <p>"What will it be."</p> <p>"There will be no safe word, there will be no safe way. No matter what, I will be there for you" She said.</p> <p>"That's the spirit." He answered.</p> <p>He led her back to her bedroom. He laid her on the bed looking down at her, he ran his finger in little circles all over her pussy, before sliding another finger into her. She felt her pussy stretch under his fingers, he used the finger on her clit and then to circle the top, she could feel her body wanting more.</p> <p>"Are you happy, fucking me?" She asked, not having said a thing yet.</p> <p>"Are you ready? Do you want me to make you feel good?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes. You just play with my tits and finger my clit until I want you to fuck me." She said.</p> <p>He continued to use his fingers on her. "You have to tell me how you want your first fuck."</p> <p>"I want you." She said as she looked down at him. "I want you to fuck me. I want you to fuck me hard and rough. I want this, I really want it, you will get me off all over again."</p> <p>"It's up to you, baby. This is all planned, I'll do what I want all we talk about all is fun and excitement, you will love every moment of it."</p> <p>"How can you know, I told you that you were to wear a condom."</p> <p>"I'll give it a good shot. If you don't I will go crazy, but if I come on to you I will keep it off."</p> <p>He smiled to himselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
