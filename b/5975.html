She trailed off, her body starting to quiver, but not from the cold. "So...you were the only human in the room when you were transformed." She turned to look me in the eye again, "But, you're a part of me. Your life will change, and your family will take care of you. Don't let me do it before then."</p> <p>"You don't understand. I could die."</p> <p>"There's no choice. You don't get a part of me. We'll both survive."</p> <p>"I'm not going to die!" she screamed, "I'm not leaving this room with you...until tomorrow."</p> <p>"You're going to get one part of you again, too, I'm sure." I responded, as my hand returned to massage her, her skin now slightly hot. I knew it would take just a few more minutes to get her to be back where she was, her body still quivering. She would not be able to stand for much longer now.</p> <p>"I'll do anything." She spoke softly.</p> <p>"Anything?" I replied, as gently as she would put me. I began rubbing her breasts through the thin material of her bra, her breasts rising and falling rapidly. She groaned louder, as my hand traveled up the front of her body to the very top of her lips. She shuddered, and bit her lip, as my finger slid into her mouth. I heard her moan slightly, as she sucked my finger, like my pussy. By now, the temperature had reached unbearable levels. I could barely maintain control, and wanted to do something a little daring this time.</p> <p>She shuddered once again, but this time was different. Her eyes started to close, and then they were open again. She looked scared, and a little drunk.</p> <p>"I want to, so badly, don't you want to taste me?" She nodded, very quietly.</p> <p>"I think I'd like that."</p> <p>She was a little speechless, but I managed to tell she was still so drunk on alcohol, I really couldn't keep a grip. When she was ready, she opened her eyes ever so slightly, and focused on what I was holding in my hands. She stared at me like a predator, and I began stroking my fingers down the front of her panties, slowly, teasing the thin fabric. She groaned and closed her eyes, once again breathing in sharply.</p> <p>"I...think you're wet, I guess I know."</p> <p>"Yes!" she moaned, as my finger slid against her lips, "I am. But, don't stop, I'm dying here." She spread her legs as wide as they would go, and reached down to press her hand against her pussy. My finger slipped into her, as a drop of precum oozed out of her pussy like a faucet. I moved my finger in and out as she gasped loudly, trying to keep her balance. Her lips parted and I saw her tongue moving to greet my finger. She sucked it down. I could feel her lips around my finger. She was still so wet, and so tight. Her mouth started working harder against my finger. I moved my fingertip back up her lips to press against her clit a little harder, and she groaned. She pulled my hand away from her mouth and I replaced it with my finger again, moving it in and out a little quicker. I was fucking her so hard with my two fingers and she was getting loud. Her whole body was trembling, and I looked back in time to see I was pushing the tip of my finger into her mouth, forcing it inside her. She nearly gagged as I entered her. It was quite apparent that she was really close now. I could see her fingers start to move under her body, as she tried to push herself onto my hand. Her pussy was so tight, it was pushing against my fingers, and it pulled them in and out like a big penis. I kept going, going for as long as she could, her lips moving on her lips, as she shuddered, and screamed, in pleasure. I pulled my fingers slowly off. She was panting, moaning softly, and her eyes were closed. She looked so sad, and so vulnerable. Her beautiful pink lips glistening. Her body was flushed, and shaking. I could tell she was very close to orgasm again. I removed my fingers from her mouth, and kissed her softly on her lips, while pulling my other hand up her body so I could reach her tits. I started rubbing her nipples, as she moaned softly against my lips and tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
