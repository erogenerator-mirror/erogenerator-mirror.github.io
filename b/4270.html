I'd had a strong orgasm just from that first touch of those lips...it was so fucking intense that I had to pull myself from under the covers and get up. I hadn't even bothered to do anything to try to get my dick back hard. I didn't mean to; that was all the motivation I needed. I got up and went down the stairs to the kitchen and grabbed the can of coffee that was on the counter. I got out and walked over to the fridge to pour and eat my breakfast...sigh...my appetite was gone.</p> <p>Amber sat up in the hot tub waiting; I was starving. She pulled herself out onto her hands and knees and sat there. Before I knew it she was in my lap and I was eating her out from the corner of my eye. She sat there, eyes closed, enjoying the warmth and sensuality of it. It felt as though she was a kid again and not the woman I had known.</p> <p>"You really enjoyed last night, didn't you?" I said.</p> <p>"Yes...just not all of it." She said, her voice trembling. I loved it when she did that. I kissed her...we had done that. I loved it when she did that to me. She sat there, still in my lap, while I continued to devour her mouth. "So what does the weather do today?" I asked...the question was rhetorical.</p> <p>"We have to be at the airport by eight thirty tomorrow." She said. I had to answer a million questions.</p> <p>"Good." I said. "I need to see the latest brochures."</p> <p>"Well, I want to see it first, then we can look at some other brochures later, or we can get something else started."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, that's good...please stay here for a little while longer!" I said, not taking my eyes from hers.</p> <p>"But it's our time to be together..."</p> <p>"We're getting a chance to find what we're looking for today."</p> <p>"I know, it's been a long time..." I said, reaching my hand out across to her and pulling her towards me, her leg over mine and wrapping her wet, warm body around mine.</p> <p>"But it's all going to happen this way...."</p> <p>"Yes" I said...I didn't care about anything between us now, she was everything to me, everything that I needed...she was everything to me, and I would give anything she asked and that I would do anyway. It wasn't so much the sex itself; it's much more the feeling of being in control as a person...that is something that I've done with other women. We were both on our way to being a couple, yet we needed to take our time....</p> <p>"What do you have to say for yourself." I said...almost to myself. "It is important that we don't go all-together as we've done before."</p> <p>"Yes. It's important. I like being with you too...." she said. "I'm not too worried about the time we have right now."</p> <p>"We have to be together, Amber."</p> <p>"Yes! Of course we do...."</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Chapter 18: We are One With We'll Fall</p> <p>"Babe, what is this? Where am I? What are we?" she asked. I could feel her shaking; I was shaking too, too, to be completely honest.</p> <p>"The bathroom..." I said.</p> <p>"The bathroom." Her voice was barely above a whisper, but I could hear the hunger in her as she said it. And I was so happy right then. I had done this before...it's not easy to do, you know. It's the same way with our parents. We need to be together, but we love being alone. "Oh, God, do you really mean it?" I whispered to her.</p> <p>"You know it does. It's the most important decision you'll ever have to make."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know." We kissed and hugged each other again, but I was still shaking. I pulled away...and I hadn't even got halfway there. She had a look of concern; "Are we really going to be alone?"</p> <p>"We are...."</p> <p>"I'm serious. We are. We have to be togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
