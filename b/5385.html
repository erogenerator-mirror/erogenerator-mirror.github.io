"But I don't give a shit about your boyfriend. Hell, he was never supposed to be there. He left when his wife came home drunk and fucked like a banshee. So why don't you just let me take care of you now? I know it's been a bad day and I don't really care. You're my little sister now."</p> <p>Tasha couldn't help but smile. He was just as much of a brother as she was. And so was she. "Well, I guess I don't have to wait around for you. I might go have a smoke a bit first, but my brother is really starting to come on real quick. Want to take a smoke of it while I'm here?" she asked as she got up and headed to the door.</p> <p>"Yeah, give me a sec," he said as he got up and followed her. He got into a huge recliner that Tasha couldn't sit on as he sat on the left side of it. His eyes were half up and half down, but that seemed to be all that was on his face, not just his cock. He didn't even blink when she walked over towards him as she reached for the lighter. He didn't even flinch when she lit the cigarette before handing it to him.</p> <p>"So, what's your little brother like?" Tasha asked as she watched him get off the recliner and take a long drag. She didn't want him to be angry with her, but there was something to be said in this. There was something that would bring her comfort if nothing else.</p> <p>"Oh, not too big or too small, about the same," he grinned as he lit another, but instead reached for another. "I'm about 5 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds. He's like two inches taller than me, maybe four or five inches taller. Just kind of like me."</p> <p>"Yeah, your little brother is kinda short, but he was pretty good about that," she said, getting into the habit of hanging around when her brother was at his house.</p> <p>He laughed. "Yeah, I get that a lot. But he's also my brother, so yeah."</p> <p>"I'll give you the rundown on it," Tasha said as she handed him a drag. "Do you want to go upstairs now?"</p> <p>"Naw, I think I'll be alright by myself. We can smoke, have a cigarette, then watch a movie or something. You know, the stuff on your little brother's movie list," he said, taking another drag.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know a lot of stuff about movie making," she said, getting into the habit of hanging around when her brother was at her house. She wasn't sure she should, but she figured after her brother took a hit of weed it would be a whole lot less weird than just walking along like this and smoking. Plus, she didn't have to do anything. She just didn't need anybody at the house.</p> <p>"Sure," he said as he set the cigarette down on top of his plate before taking another drag. "How do you know about little brothers and sisters?" he asked as he took another deep drag and blew out his breath through his nose. "You should tell them the details," he said as he watched her take another drag and exhale. "Just keep it straight, okay?"</p> <p>"Sure," Tasha agreed as she took another drag. "They're your brothers after all. I guess the best thing to do would be to tell them everything."</p> <p>"No that's what's going to go down," he said, getting back into the recliner next to her as she sat in the recliner next to him. "They're not your brothers, they're brothers."</p> <p>"Yeah, but some sisters should have a little brother in their lives," she joked as she watched him slide his seat all the way back. "You know, I've had enough boys before. All I ever want is one good dick and they usually have their balls up their little sister's ass at night. And don't forget about those chicks. My older brothers are about the same age."</p> <p>"You and me?" he asked with a laugh. "Yeah, me and my brother are just kind of close now. So, where's your brother anyway? Should I tell him?" Tasha joked as she looked down at her plate. She had no intention of telling him everything that was coming up but she was sure she could convince him.</p> <p>"Nope, my brother's about the same age as I am. He's a few years older than I am. He left because he found out his sister was fucking around with some guy at one of his housesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
