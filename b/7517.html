We climb up onto the bed, and kiss, sharing my juices and hers.</p> <p>We lie next to each other. I can only stare, as Becky pushes me away and lies down on the other side of me with her head on my tits and her legs wide open.</p> <p>'God, I needed that,' she pouts. I know where it is going to end up. What was it I had said, I want to go to the hotel again?</p> <p>'I can't really tell the difference,' I say, and I move my hand down to her snatch. She's still as wet as before.</p> <p>'I did it for you,' she says, looking at me, and wiggling it back at me.</p> <p>I don't know if that's the most I can tell, or the most you can tell.</p> <p>'I'll tell you what you have been waiting for. Tell me what you think I should do,' I say. I turn on my side to face Becky, and we press our lips together. She pulls my face to hers, and we kiss deeply. We make out for a few seconds, and I slide my hand down Becky's waist, to lay on her abdomen, down towards her sex.</p> <p>Her hand runs through my hair, and her breath catches.</p> <p>She takes my hand, and places it around her crotch, holding my hand there, as though she wanted me to touch her. I can feel the warmth of her, and the outline of her cunt through her panties, and I squeeze the crotch, which is moist with excitement.</p> <p>'Mmm, your touch feels good. I need to cum,' Becky says.</p> <p>'Yes,' I reply, and lift her hand, and bring it to my lips. I kiss all around her hand, and up my wrist and along a finger. I start to rub her clit, as we kiss now, and make out for a few seconds.</p> <p>I slide both her hand and mine down inside her panties, and put it directly on her pussy. I rub my thumb over her clit, and she takes my hand and starts to rub it slowly, and it makes her shudder.</p> <p>She grabs her pussy with both of her hands, as she watches me rub her. We both open our mouths again, and kiss wildly, as we can look each other in the eye.</p> <p>I move down her jaw, and kiss her. I rub the outside of her lips with my tongue, and open her mouth with my tongue.</p> <p>I kiss her cheek, and down her neck, and across to her breast. I give it a final, lingering, lick, then open her mouth further. I rub both her nipples, one at a time, with my tongue. I lick her tit, and her areola, which is now rock hard. I take her nipple between my thumb and forefinger, and massage it. I take my thumb and finger in one small hand, and start to roll her nipple around with it, whilst at the same time rubbing her cunt in the other. Becky is wiggling her crotch into my face.</p> <p>'That's so good,' she gasps into my ear. 'I can't believe it's happened, and I need it so bad,' she moans, and takes her hands down and back up her body, over her breast, her neck, her cheek, down to her mouth. We kiss again, and hold each other close.</p> <p>I take off my blouse and bra, and my mini-skirt, and lay back, on the bed. I move down Becky's body, between her legs, and start to rub her crotch more vigorously.</p> <p>We kiss, and I take her hands and put them up to her breasts. We kiss for a few moments.</p> <p>We open our mouths and share passionate kisses again. Her eyes are shut, and one of her hands still on her stomach. She is trying to pull my hand higher. I give it an extra tug, and she starts to moan softly.</p> <p>Becky doesn't have long to wait. She pulls my hand up higher, and starts to rub her clitoris against the tips of my fingers while we kiss again. It is difficult to concentrate, and to maintain a straight, single motion. The sight of all that lust fills my vision.</p> <p>Becky starts to come, and lets the sensations envelop her, she puts her hand down to her crotch, and rubs herself, as I kiss her throat and chest.</p> <p>'Mmm,' she moans into my mouth. She is close now.</p> <p>My own desire is overcoming me, and my hand starts to move faster, rubbing her clit on the tip of myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
