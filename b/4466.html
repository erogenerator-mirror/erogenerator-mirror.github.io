Her eyes looked so dark, and her mouth, and tongue so swollen from sucking, of trying to get all over, as it was too much for me to handle.</p> <p>"I'm going to go," I told her, my voice sounding strained, "I'm going to get me a drink, or both." I could not say I was drunk enough, not to want to see her, but my hormones were going crazy to the thought of fucking her in her ass.</p> <p>As I ran off, I heard her mutter softly, "I am going to get another drink."</p> <p>I felt her hot breathe. She moved closer for a kiss. I slid into her as the kiss grew. I knew she felt, as well as heard, that I tasted so good. Her hands moved down over my shoulders, pulling me in. The kiss lasted longer than it had with my other woman. I felt the heat of her body as my dick pressed against her pussy lips. For a second it was very awkward, but then a soft moan escaped her lips. She wrapped her arms around my torso, and we resumed making out.</p> <p>I pulled away.</p> <p>"So, you and I going to go, huh," I told her, not believing her response. "Is that gonna happen?"</p> <p>"I don't know, but what do you think she's going to say? Is that too far, too fast? If she doesn't like it, if she thinks it's too dangerous?"</p> <p>"Well, I don't know. She's just not your type, you know?"</p> <p>She shook her head.</p> <p>I reached behind her to play with her ass.</p> <p>"Go! Go! Go!"</p> <p>My body convulsed from the contact and I dropped to the seat. My dick was throbbing and leaking precum. She turned to look out the window.</p> <p>"That is a bad idea!"</p> <p>She shook her head again.</p> <p>"It feels so good. It feels really good to you right now. But, it's not your type. In fact, what is so bad about any type is how much it turns me on."</p> <p>She had started to laugh.</p> <p>"Is that why you took me to that club."</p> <p>"No, but that is why I was sitting there."</p> <p>She looked at me.</p> <p>"So, do you like black cock?"</p> <p>"I like Black cock in all of your holes, or in all your holes."</p> <p>I reached down.</p> <p>"And it's a turn on," she said. She didn't need to. It was already too late. "It's so black and it's so big." My fingers started to move up and down my dick, trying to make it feel as it was at a more full setting.</p> <p>She saw what I was trying to do, and leaned back in the big chair. Her shirt slipped off. I knew she had no bra on. Her large breasts were bouncing up and down with each thrust of my dick. I tried to hold back, but I had to come. I reached around and started to play with her breast. I pinched her nipple and squeezed it. I felt her body tense as she neared climax, and I knew she was there. And, she was coming hard. Her pussy was quivering around my member. I started to come, and she squeezed her legs together. She squeezed my shaft tighter. She pushed out against me, and I felt her legs pull me inside her with every spasm.</p> <p>I collapsed in the big chair, totally spent. She leaned back into me. I moved my hand down to her dripping pussy and started to play with her clit. She spread her legs.</p> <p>"Go to hell," she said, as I started to move inside of her. "I want it here, right now."</p> <p>"Me too," I told her.</p> <p>I kissed one side of her neck as I slid in and out. We continued like this for a while, until she started to make noises. She pushed on my shoulders.</p> <p>"Hold still. You are moving really slow."</p> <p>"What?" she exclaimed.</p> <p>"I said hold still."</p> <p>She reached over and grabbed my hand, and moved it from her pussy to her ass. I moved my thumb up and down her ass crack.</p> <p>"No. No touching there."</p> <p>"Please," I could not say no.</p> <p>She looked at me and then back at her.</p> <p>"Okay," I said.</p> <p>"You can come again. You can be on your back with me on top."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"We can do that again."</p> <p>"But, I need a drink," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
