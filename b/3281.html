It’s just…well, I’m sorry I haven’t really asked you out.”</p> <p>I could imagine where Michael’s mind was. Here’s the good old scene that happened over a couple weeks ago. A guy had come over and asked me if he could fuck the girl he saw hanging out with the other girl. Well, I’m sorry I haven’t answered. Maybe she does know how to kiss. Anyway, here’s the good thing,” he continued, “if Michael wants that we can do it at your place. I’ll go out on the beach and watch out of the pool and a while.”</p> <p>Michael’s admission brought me back to what I wanted but wasn’t too sure about. I wasn’t sure how I would feel about that. I hadn’t had much experience with a guy and I certainly wasn’t ready to make love to anyone. But I wasn’t going to run out there and throw up either. I had to ask. “Michael, how often do you think you can spend time out by yourself?”</p> <p>Michael looked over my shoulder at me and gave me that killer smile.</p> <p>“Do you know that I have a roommate or something?” he asked, teasing, like it was the most innocent thing he had ever asked. He just didn’t know what to say to me now.</p> <p>“Sure, Michael,” I answered, “just go and change. I’ll change. That’s all.”</p> <p>Michael left saying goodbye as he walked out the door. I wasn’t sure I could get away with anything. I still had three dates with him and three of that night. But now that it was over, I had been ready to make love to Michael again. I couldn’t wait!</p> <p>We returned to The Beach with our wine glasses and talked about sex and all. During this conversation I had felt somewhat awkward with my own feelings. I felt very embarrassed that I was so close to Michael in the beginning and I felt as if I should be ashamed for behaving so badly. I didn’t know how to react to the fact that Michael seemed so serious about me. But the feelings that he brought out in me quickly gave me the courage to speak to him in a way that would show that I wanted to help him and that I didn’t just need to have sex because that was what I needed to do to relieve any guilt I may have felt over the past few weeks. When I saw him looking at me I felt as if my heart would burst out of my chest. I guess that my feelings for our relationship were so strong that no one was able to tell or even see for many days. After our initial discussion, he seemed to be coming out of his shell. It was hard to say because I was thinking how much I was about to change.</p> <p>The more we talked and drank our wine the more I felt that this might be the end of our relationship and I wouldn’t want to lose my first real lover. Michael kept me talking throughout the evening. We were both pretty tipsy from the wine and the first half of a bottle we had. As he kept looking at me I noticed his erect penis and all that sex. There were a few things he said that made me think he didn’t like being around me, but as my own feelings for Michael began to develop, I found it kind to think about. He had gotten a few drinks more than I had and even more after my first drink of wine. He got a bit bolder with the wine though. I could tell that he was really thinking about doing this thing with me and trying to act natural about it. I was thinking that maybe I could help him with his sex talk.</p> <p>We were standing outside of his apartment building and he was looking across the street. Suddenly he reached under his loose fitting swimsuit and pulled his hard cock out and started stroking himself through his swimsuit. I thought that maybe I would help him with a plan. I quickly stripped naked and came inside the door. He had a bottle of wine in his hand and his face was flushed.</p> <p>“Are you sure about this? He asked.</p> <p>“No, Michael,” I answered, “I’m not sure. It’s been a long while.”</p> <p>“What do you want from me?” he said as he leaned against the door frame.</p> <p>“I don’t know,” I answered as I walked—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
