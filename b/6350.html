The sound of gravel and snow on the pavement echoed loudly, but I didn't stop to look. I looked down at myself. I was nude, except for the chain, attached to the front of my leash. I had been chained up and I was completely at my Master's mercy. My Master could do with me whatever he wished. His leash was hanging loosely from his neck. The air around me stirred my body, sending shivers down my body and causing my nipples to harden with excitement. I felt dizzy, like lightening had passed over me. It reminded me of when I was a child, always in the back seat of my car when I was playing with toys, and I loved that about the car. Now, standing naked and barefoot near the sidewalk, I shuddered as the waves of my first orgasm rippled through me. I felt weak in the knees for just a second then regained my balance, sliding down a few hundred feet before I collapsed completely to the ground.</p> <p>I could hear footsteps, followed by someone approaching me. A woman about my age with her hand down her short black skirt and hiking boots. A man about my age, with a shaved head, dressed in a t-shirt and cargo shorts, walked up to our driver's side, a huge man in his mid 20's with a beer bottle in his hand.</p> <p>"My name is Eric," he said with a smile on his face. "So, I'm your boss. How did you miss me?"</p> <p>"I had to get here by myself. I'm at the office, not getting up to speed on my paperwork." I replied. "If you'll excuse me, I guess I have to be at the office for about two hours, so lets get to it."</p> <p>He nodded toward me, then led the way to the front of the car. I followed, feeling a little more naked, with all the clothes on me. They must be in the closet or someplace else because I felt myself getting sweaty and uncomfortable again. I glanced between the driver's seat and the trunk, noticing a pair of heels, a collar and a leash, a big metal dog leash, and a dog with silver clips running over its head.</p> <p>"Well," He said, "I guess you're glad the roads were clear." he laughed while looking me over. "Come along, pet."</p> <p>My feet were on the ground next to my Master's at the side of the hood. "Would you kindly have your collar shortened so I could attach it to my neck when I was finished?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes Sir." I replied, looking up to see him standing in front of me with his head bowed and hands under his chin. I stood before him and he began to slowly lead me by the leash.</p> <p>As he leaded me toward the hood, I stepped down first, then slid the leash back toward the drivers side. I felt his hands on my back as he turned me around again, then slid the leash to the hood, turning me around so he could clip the collar around my neck. I couldn't believe it when I heard it snap shut in my ear. The chain went from the hood to the inside of the hood and he tugged the leash once more to my right.</p> <p>"Come around me, pet." He said in a stern voice. I followed suit and he turned me around again. I followed suit and then stepped in front of him, turning my back to him. I felt his hands on my back, sliding down to my bare butt. He ran the back of his hand up my bare butt crack and then back up to my butt.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, that feels even better." He teased me.</p> <p>"I'll take that," I giggled. I felt his left hand slip under my leg to cup and squeeze my butt cheeks.</p> <p>"There's room for another." He said in a way that let me know he had a point.</p> <p>"I know. Now, go ahead and kneel." I turned around again and did as he said.</p> <p>He was still kneeling, looking down at me. "You seem a little tense."</p> <p>"I'm nervous." I answered through my giggles. I liked it when he made me feel nervous. "I wouldn't be at the office and you could be with somebody."</p> <p>"I'm sure you would be. It would be nice to know someone, you know, safe, and protected."</p> <p>I thought about that. "I know you'll be safe with someone."</p> <p>"Yes you will. Just go back to your seat so we could go in without any interruptions." He smiled and nodded to my leash. I felt a rush of relief.
