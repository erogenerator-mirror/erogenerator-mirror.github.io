We sat and giggled our way across the stage to pick up our seats at the side. My sister's best friend's husband was not at home. My parents and my father were downstairs watching TV. I could smell bacon and eggs, but when I peeked in the bathroom I was greeted with the sights. I was a lucky bastard.</p> <p>The food was great. I had never tasted bacon before, but the smell was wonderful. I think I heard my mother moaning from the sink at one point because a minute or two later my dad stepped inside the bathroom, looked in and saw the bacon in the bowl of hot water, turned to see if there was anything else on the stove, and saw my sister holding her hand over her mouth. The sound echoed off the tile in the kitchen. He turned quickly and stared as though he would just freeze in the middle of the sentence, then turned and smiled. He did not ask my Mom what she meant until my mother did. He asked if my date was coming. My mother's head whipped around and she raised her right palm in a questioning way. I didn't say a word I just smiled, and nodded. She pointed to a picture on a dresser. He was stunned. I smiled big and he nodded.</p> <p>My sister was dressed in a pink baby doll with tiny tiny little white panties. Her nipples were still very sensitive, and I could tell by the tone of her voice that she was enjoying herself. I knew she wanted more. I don't think my mom and I had been in the family room more than a lifetime since I moved in with my mom. My dad and Mom were always a bit of a prude around the house. The little girl was so shy. My dad would go downstairs and play the guitar. He would take a break at one point but I would come upstairs and listen to the music. My parents told me about some of the girls and I'd listen and feel them. I'd also listen to my sister. I was a little older and we never had sex before. Even the girls I liked were just kids after awhile.</p> <p>My dad and I have had a long discussion every week on whether there was any chance that my parents would make any changes. I decided not to make it the last couple of weeks and hoped they would not make them any farther that day. I also knew there would be more than just sex. I thought I would look through my purse and pull out my tooth brush after I'd made the trip to get mom's favorite toothpaste.</p> <p>The doorbell rang. My mother looked up as she opened the door and smiled. She gave my dad a big smile and raised herself up slightly in response. He shook his head and said "My car's here already." She nodded and told him to hurry up and get dressed. Her son turned and pulled off the driveway and ran down the stairs, then came back to her looking surprised. I knew they would have to see my parents in the front of their truck. There was just one more thing to worry about, and then everything was looking suspiciously differentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
