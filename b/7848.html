You look like you're having troubles on the surface."</p> <p>"I'm fine," she reassured me. "I was afraid you'd see."</p> <p>Then, in a tone that could be interpreted as a warning sign, she began, "I have to go back home. Do you have a car you can bring with you? I'm sorry to bring it home, Sir."</p> <p>"Are you sorry to have gone from the car to the bed, to your own room?"</p> <p>"No, Sir."</p> <p>"Did it offend you that I couldn't get rid of you?"</p> <p>"No! It was...exciting," she assured me. "But there's no place I'd rather be than in my own room."</p> <p>"Then we'll have to go."</p> <p>I was surprised by her enthusiasm. It was like she really needed a break from our little threesome. I could only imagine what she was thinking about her mother, the first time she had allowed herself to be taken from her when she was much younger. I couldn't help myself. "You are a very naughty girl, Ms. Miller. I want to help you."</p> <p>"Why yes, Sir. I could use a good spanking to motivate me."</p> <p>"Good!"</p> <p>"Thank you for helping me."</p> <p>It was then that the mood changed again with the light in her bedroom changed, and the doorbell rang. I grabbed my purse from under the bed before opening the doorknocker and grabbing my things.</p> <p>"I hope I can get another present before I leave," she said as she ran upstairs to the phone. "I forgot the receipt there."</p> <p>I grabbed a phone book with her number in the middle of it and followed the hallway until I made the first turn into the living room. I watched her come out, her hair slicked back from her head, wearing a pair of loose fitting jeans that I realized were made of a silk fabric.</p> <p>She was still bent over at the waist, her jeans pushed low on her hips showing off her ass.</p> <p>"Now who's on the phone?" I joked. She just smiled as she turned to face me, smiling wide as she saw that I was already leaning over the desk to look at a list on the computer screen.</p> <p>She smiled broadly as she walked over to me on the far side from the screen, her breasts jiggling seductively. She took my hands and placed my hands around her waist as we embraced.</p> <p>My heart was beating in my ears, as if the entire world outside our city was waiting to see how excited I was and how we were going to make it work.</p> <p>"That was very good, Sir."</p> <p>"Oh, my!" I thought to myself. "Now, do you have the receipt before you leave?"</p> <p>"Yes," she agreed. "I got my way."</p> <p>"Good," I said, "Let's get those clothes off."</p> <p>We took turns pulling each other's clothes down over our hips, and we stood there for several minutes as I checked and rechecked her clothes until they had vanished over her hips and bottom. There was no panty lines, or even the slightest hint of a tan line and it was plain and concise.</p> <p>I helped her out of her shoes and she began to walk over to me. "No, Sir," she said, her voice a quiet whisper. It was clear she was still a little nervous about what happened tonight, especially after the way she had treated me before.</p> <p>"Ms. Miller? I have to go to the store today."</p> <p>"Yes, Sir," she replied, "I'll need at least an hour before I leave town to pick it up tomorrow."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Sir. I thought you would come here to work."</p> <p>"I was worried that I'd disappoint you, Ms. Miller."</p> <p>"No, you don't hear me complaining," she said softly, "I came here to stay and serve you."</p> <p>"Well, it's not like that," I said, stepping toward her. She raised her arms to me.</p> <p>"Would you do me one more favor, Sir?" she asked as she placed both hands on my chest.</p> <p>"Anything, Ms. Miller. You're in charge."</p> <p>She smiled and began to sway her hips seductively, moving her hands up and down to indicate that she liked what she was doing. My hands were tremblingly shaking as I took her up to a standing position. She began slowly swaying, turning her backside as she swayed, pressing the soft fabric of her jeans against my chest.</p> <p>I put my arms around her waist as she began to sway against me, causing us to bump together on cue.
