She asked, leading him up to it as he was already in her arms.</p> <p>"This place is amazing. I never imagined I'd live here!" Jack's voice cracked as they climbed the stairs and came to the top.</p> <p>"Oh! I didn't think you could!"</p> <p>"We don't have to do anything we don't want to do. There's no going to be a big deal."</p> <p>"I know, I can't wait for the right moment." He looked down at her body as they stood in the apartment. She was in black shorts and a loose fitting button down shirt that was unbuttoned all the way down to her belly button.</p> <p>"This is nice," he finally said.</p> <p>"Yeah, me too." She reached up and brushed his hair out of his eyes.</p> <p>"Do you know why you're here?"</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I want to see what's underneath those shorts."</p> <p>"Oh! Okay, I don't think I could do this without you." "Why are you here? You know you're a..."</p> <p>"A married woman who's going to be working on a film studio."</p> <p>"No, she isn't. I'm just... You're..."</p> <p>His voice faded away as he said, "I don't want to be. I've... I've never."</p> <p>"Neither have I." She looked back up at him with a confused expression on her face.</p> <p>He didn't know why he was saying those words. But he wanted to hear them from her. Maybe he wanted to kiss her because he didn't have the urge. Maybe he just wanted to hear her say them, because when he'd said them, they'd gone beyond just being friends.</p> <p>"Jack, are you kidding? I haven't heard you say no, so why?"</p> <p>"Because if I'm not, that would make me a virgin and I've never done anything with a woman."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not a virgin by any means. But I am not one either."</p> <p>"I know that, but I'd love to. I don't know how we'd manage without it either. And I'm still not sure this is what I want or what I really want."</p> <p>"Neither are I, but what we have is special. It isn't like I'm asking for all of the love you're asking for."</p> <p>"But what if the sex is different?"</p> <p>She shrugged and looked over at her watch. "There's a good chance that things will turn out like they did today, with no other choice. But I'm going to be at work and I'm not getting home until later today for some reason."</p> <p>"How is that possible? Why does it matter?"</p> <p>She sighed. "It doesn't matter what happened, if I wasn't there, if I'm not what you and I both think I am, then it doesn't matter." She turned to her phone and flipped it open. "I've never... I don't..."</p> <p>Jack stood up and put his arms around her. "Hey, whatever you don't want to do isn't going to happen without us talking."</p> <p>She pulled back slightly as a blush came over her face.</p> <p>"But I want you so much. You don't have to do this."</p> <p>"What? What do you think I want?" She looked at him and sighed. "I'm not just a woman. A woman with no man in my life, I'm just a woman with a man in the real world, and..."</p> <p>Jack smiled and pulled her tight against him. "I know. I've loved your body ever since we met."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"But nothing. I want this more than I'm ready to admit, and I want you more than I'll ever admit to myself, so there's no turning back."</p> <p>"But aren't you a virgin? We've been seeing each other less and less, because of..."</p> <p>They had been in different situations before, Jack was more mature and knew what he was doing, but this was different. More intimate, more intense, he wasn't worried about being an old fuddy duddy, but he was also more honest and sure of himself, if anyone but himself.</p> <p>"I'm a very, very good man. I want this to all work out. And I believe if you and I both don't have fun, then we should go to a hotel and make love." He kissed her softly on the lips and turned her face towards him. He looked into her eyes and saw the uncertainty thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
