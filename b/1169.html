He looked very nervous as we walked through the lobby. I was glad we were in the parking lot, I thought we might be seen. But it happened so quickly after he had come out I felt he was nervous enough already. I walked him over to the car and opened the door. Then he got in and I closed the door and went around back of him. He still had a slight feeling in his stomach and hands that he held in place as I reached around him to give his cock a couple of times. He did not try anything. It kind of turned me on to see it. I gave his cock about a couple of minutes and he was looking at my pussy. I took a chance and slid out of my chair and sat astride his lap. I slowly lifted on top of him and slowly slid down. He was getting pretty turned on and I noticed he was really turned on, his cock was standing out in front of me from his pubic hair. I continued my ride on him and began playing with his nipples and breasts. He let me have a breast play and I sucked on them while he tweaked my nipple. When we were done, I gave his cock another squeeze and he let out a very surprised sound. I kissed him on the lips and he returned the kiss. I felt his cock get hard and he began massaging it through his pants.</p> <p>"Now that wasn't too much, was it?" I kissed him and we went outside. I was getting ready to go to the bathroom so we sat in the car. I didn't want to say anything. We left the building, I got out his keys and we headed down for the office. Again he was looking in my direction.</p> <p>"You can see I am really wet down there, are you?"</p> <p>"I'll take care of you." I told him and gave him directions to the office. He showed me the door, when he saw the office, he looked at me like he wanted me to tell him something. So, I sat down next to him on the couch. He turned his head and said;</p> <p>"That thing is huge."</p> <p>"Well, I'm only average, so I'm not sure what to compare." I replied, with a laugh. He started laughing and said;</p> <p>"Sorry, I thought you would like it. I had to get around to the bathroom and get things fixed."</p> <p>I gave him a big kiss and reached up. I unzipped his pants and found his rock hard cock. In one quick move, I took it in my mouth and started working my mouth up and down slowly. It felt great, after a couple of minutes he grabbed my head and started to fuck my mouth. He was groaning and I knew it wouldn't be long now. I felt his body start to tense up and he moaned as he released a hot load down my throat. He pulled my face off his cock and collapsed on the couch.</p> <p>"That was great!" he said. "I've never done anything like that with anyone else."</p> <p>"No! No, I'm not ready for that. I can't do that." I said as I sat there panting, holding my breath, staring into his eyes.</p> <p>"Ok, but there is something to tell you. If you decide to try that and it isn't too bad, I have to tell you I really don't have a lot to offer just then." He said.</p> <p>"No, not at all. This is not just sex I would like to do, you really are awesome." I told him.</p> <p>Then he got me out of my chair and gave me a passionate kiss and told me I could go upstairs and have sex anytime. I said I had never done that before. That night was very memorable. I made him come again that night. Afterward, he invited me back over to his place and I let him see more of me. It was one of the most intense orgasms I had ever had. I could tell he really enjoyed seeing me get off. I guess we were having sex again a few more times before he asked me to leave.</p> <p>I started on him the next day and got him going. It wasn't that he did it that often, it was him being so bold. But, it was so good it was always with some help from the guy. I wasn't sure I could go another week without getting sucked off. He got off in the ladies room so I walked back to him. I kissed him and grabbed his cock and gave him another kiss. We went to his place and had sex every two or three hours. We had great sex on a regular basis, but it had to be special, and not every guy was out of his league. And we were always naked when we were in hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
