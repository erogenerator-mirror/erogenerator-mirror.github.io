Anyway, thank you for letting me stay with you," she said, and she stood up. "I haven't seen or heard from you in so long," she added. Her smile broadened at the end, but she just shrugged again.</p> <p>"Sure, I'll come see you sometime," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, I plan on spending some time with you," I laughed. "The last time I saw you, you were in a bar, the last guy I had any contact with as a friend. Anyway, I know you're gonna be busy with your own studies." I took her by the hand, and led her out of the room. She turned to hug me after a couple thrusts. After that, we took off, and as I drove home, I told Giselle I'd come and stay over the weekend. Giselle accepted, and we settled down to have dinner that night. We shared a couple glasses of wine, and when she took me into the bedroom, I was about ready to take her to bed, but she just rolled toward me and kissed me. It was slow and warm, her lips sliding around mine as we kissed. It was a kiss like none other I had ever even imagined, and soon, I felt the wetness between her legs and knew it wasn't just from our kissing, and it didn't matter.</p> <p>We kept kissing throughout dinner, and after dinner, I suggested going to the hotel spa. "But it's way outside of town," she said, "so we don't have a whole lot of time!" She hugged me tightly as we walked to the car, and I couldn't keep my hand off her as we rode. As it turned out, we were on a couple blocks to the spa.</p> <p>Once inside, we went into a small private bathroom adjoining a private pool, and I took her close. I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her, as my mouth met hers again. Giselle's hands slid along my back and onto my ass, and after a minute, we were both breathing hard and trying to stand up, so we stepped back. "Let's go," she said. She picked up one of the robes, and we walked to a mirror.</p> <p>"God, I look ridiculous," Giselle laughed. She handed me a robe, and I hung it over the bar counter. She grabbed the bar, and we headed across the street to the spa. The pool looked pretty cool, with a clear tiled floor and a Jacuzzi. It had two pool-beds, one on each side of the deck. After that, we walked around the back, where the spa was, and Giselle took the lead next, leading me over to the end of the deck. On one end, there was a nice outdoor shower, and on the other, a room with a hot tub and a massage table.</p> <p>She led me to the table and started pouring a pitcher of drinks, and then she sat down on the table next to me. "How about a drink?" she asked. I went to the bar, poured the same drink, then took Giselle's hand.</p> <p>"I'm on the pill. I hope you'll be comfortable. Do you want me to wear my bra for you?" she teased. I handed the glass to her.</p> <p>"No, that's okay. Your choice," I answered.</p> <p>"You can take it off," she added.</p> <p>I just smiled, and she undid the top of her bra, then rolled it up and over her left arm. At this point, she pulled the straps off her shoulders, and tossed it in next to the tray. Her right arm was crossed, and her eyes were closed as she took sips and sipped her drink. "There," she said.</p> <p>I could see she was looking forward to another evening out with her lover. Her left breast was just a couple inches from my mouth, and it was a clear invitation to kiss it. Before I could move for a second, she kissed the side of my lips, then slowly worked her way down. I was still a little surprised when she put her hand on my bare thigh, and I didn't know how to respond. She gently squeezed lightly, then slid her hand up to my crotch and rubbed it for a couple minutes. The kiss was a slow seduction, my tongue seeking hers out, and our kisses becoming more passionate.</p> <p>Once again, she broke the kiss and looked up at me, this time only looking intently into my eyes. Her hand moved back up to my crotch, feeling my hardened cock. It was at this point that I realized I was in real trouble.
