I just want you to be happy," I told her.</p> <p>"Yeah but what about the job," she said.</p> <p>"It's not as if we need it," I told her and tried to make the pain go away when she added, "That will be our problem. We will always be together."</p> <p>"We will always be together," she said. "When did it start?"</p> <p>That would be another story. I was working hard and I was not getting ahead of myself. I needed to learn what to do about my girlfriend. I would have her.</p> <p>When I arrived home from my job the next evening, I was tired. I wasn't sure what to do. I could stay home and think. It felt good to have my head filled with thoughts about things. I thought about Amy. I thought about a lot of things. A very large smile crossed my face as I thought about my girlfriend sitting up in bed and thinking about this upcoming date. I could tell as soon as I closed my eyes that I was asleep. I don't think I slept that night. I don't know how or why I woke up. I can't say much, just that I don't remember much. I remember that night when we were in the middle of bed. I remember Amy was laying beside me. It was one of those nights. We had been having sex. I think it was after midnight when I fell asleep.</p> <p>But it may have been after midnight. Perhaps it was before I came in the middle of my sleep. I am not sure. I don't know.</p> <p>The next morning when I woke up, I was surprised to see Amy. I thought of her but she didn't talk. She just stood there. I didn't notice until I rolled off the bed and saw her hand on her mouth. I think I said something to her.</p> <p>"I'm fine," I lied.</p> <p>"You don't remember?" She asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," I admitted. "But it just happened."</p> <p>"I don't blame you. Now come on let's get to work. We need a little practice."</p> <p>"Why'd you change your mind?"</p> <p>"It might help if you were here," I admitted.</p> <p>"I'm only trying too," she smiled.</p> <p>Amy had gotten up from bed, had breakfast in the kitchen and was putting her breakfast on the stove when I climbed out of the bed. I went into the kitchen and poured all the coffee from the pot on the stove. Then I returned to the bedroom and sat down. I poured some of the same coffee. It was the same so far though. When Amy came back in the room, I was amazed to see her still lying there naked. When she turned around to face me, her body was beautiful. Her small breasts were perky and tipped with long nipples. Her legs also looked strong. Her pubic hair was dark and soft and neatly trimmed.</p> <p>"I think I better go get dressed," I said softly.</p> <p>"Oh," she replied. "Go ahead and get dressed then I'll go change while you do that."</p> <p>"Surely you can stay," I said.</p> <p>"Well," I continued, "I might as well get going. I don't want to be late."</p> <p>"Are we going to have sex," she asked.</p> <p>"For the first time in a very long time it is going to be sex," I replied.</p> <p>"What's that supposed to mean," she asked.</p> <p>"It means we are going to have sex tonight. I'll help with your homework," I suggested.</p> <p>"And I'll help you with my homework," she suggested.</p> <p>"I don't know," I replied. "I guess it just goes with how you are."</p> <p>"I'm serious," she said. "I really am looking forward to having sex with you tonight. I am going to be so horny tonight. I couldn't be happier."</p> <p>"Me too," I agreed. "I just wondered how you would feel about that."</p> <p>"It's the least I can do," she said. "But I guess I don't need to give you oral sex."</p> <p>"I guess I need to keep up with you," I said.</p> <p>After we had finished breakfast, we were both in the spare bedroom when I heard the door opening. I was surprised to hear Amy come in the room but I wasn't complaining. I wondered if she wanted to try another position to try and get me to help her with her homework. I wasn't sure about that, though. We had shared a little of our relationship in many ways. There was more of a reason for us than just sex.</p> <p>"What'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
