We rolled our hips and fucked again. I had stopped just when the contractions from our orgasms were starting, since we'd been going so long so just had to finish again, too. She finally gave one last whimper and pressed back until the contractions started again, too. Finally we came together, and we collapsed onto the bed.</p> <p>"That was marvelous! I don't think I've ever had anything in my ass and another cock so big inside me." I'm not trying to tell you I didn't like a lot of the stuff, or even half of it. A little of what was in her was mine.</p> <p>There's nothing worse than a hot-looking white girl with chocolate colored tits. It was a lot easier to get naked, though, since we were both a sweaty mess.</p> <p>Afterwards we said goodbye and got a taxi back to her place.</p> <p>We had the same room, as a couple. She put me in the same bed as her and got out of bed to go get something to drink, also. She came back and set my empty glass next to ours, and then gave me that same shy smile that I'd seen when we went to a movie together, and set her drink on the nightstand next to mine.</p> <p>She came back and picked it up, then turned and laid down on top of me. While I put her drink on my lips I moved my fingers up to her neck and down to her chest, and then into her bra to hold her boobs in one hand.</p> <p>After a while, we both got up and went into the shower, and I turned it on. Our bodies got the water good, and we climbed in and soaked and touched each other.</p> <p>"This is nice..." she said, "and it feels nice and..."</p> <p>I let the words hang in the air. We kissed again, then she went down on me again, soaping and soaping until my cock had come to full hardness.</p> <p>Then she got up and came over to the nightstand and picked up her vibrator and put it on the nightstand to start. Soon, I was lying on the edge of orgasm with my mind on the feeling of the vibrations through my cock. She stood up, turned around, and started to play with her dildo.</p> <p>We kissed again for a while.</p> <p>"How about me on the bed, and we can start over...then you can turn on the other one..." she said.</p> <p>This was definitely getting to me so, though I didn't think it could go on, and neither of us was able to do anything about it. She got the dildo and joined me on the bed. I took her vibrator off, and then she did the same thing to me. Now we had a nice new toy to go along with her new sensations.</p> <p>She kept it on high until I said, "OK, turn it up a little bit. Then bring it to me, and turn it off a bit. I'll start on it when you come back out of the shower..."</p> <p>It wasn't long before she was back on me, and soon we had the vibrator on me and her hand up my robe, playing with my cock while she kept her vibrator in me, the dildo coming up her pussy to rub against her clit, and the dildo on top of my cock. After her movements got more excited she pulled down hard on my cock and began squirming as she neared the pinnacle.</p> <p>"I can feel it, honey..." she said. "Right then."</p> <p>I turned the damn thing on her.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck, yes!" she said. "Right there...I'm going to cum! Oh, I'm cumming!"</p> <p>I turned it on her even faster, and she began squeezing her pussy around my cock while she came, too.</p> <p>"Oh fuck! Oh, it's amazing!" she said. "I'm going to cum again!"</p> <p>"OK, baby..." I said. "You've done it, I've done it..."</p> <p>"I know, but I want to give both of you more, and I know you want it..."</p> <p>I kissed her and pushed her ass up so I could play with her, then got on my knees and brought hers down. Then I got on top of her and fucked her.</p> <p>"It's gonna be good!" she said through clinched teeth. "I want both of us to cum together."</p> <p>A thought occurred to me, and I slowed down, then sped up, but never too fast. We came together twice more, then lay there for a minute.</p> <p>"You've done it, too, and I think you're doing the same for me..." she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
