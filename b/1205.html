The whole time we're at your house and you're standing right next to us, it's not like you're not being a complete idiot."</p> <p>"What?!?" Michelle asked in disbelief.</p> <p>"Come on." John said in a forceful tone.</p> <p>Michelle looked to her parents, then back to him.</p> <p>"This was the last straw. I don't trust them anymore."</p> <p>"Well, why don't we see what happens when they're drunk and have a terrible time."</p> <p>Michelle nodded, with relief.</p> <p>"Don't do anything you won't like." John said.</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean." Michelle replied.</p> <p>"Please." Michelle pleaded.</p> <p>"You're not drunk are you?" John asked.</p> <p>"No. I had two glasses of wine and was on the edge of my seat in only a thin silk shirt. I'm not sure who took me over. But I'm sure that no one did" Michelle tried to explain.</p> <p>"Well, it's true, but they're still drunk and we're all still here."</p> <p>"Yeah, but you don't have a stitch on. You're completely covered in your own juices and I can hardly tell." Michelle said in confusion.</p> <p>"And you were wet."</p> <p>"Yes I was. Did you enjoy it?" Michelle asked.</p> <p>"Yes!" Michelle replied.</p> <p>"No, I meant if you could't tell us that you're horny." Michelle replied.</p> <p>"No, it's nothing like that." Michelle said.</p> <p>"Well I guess you'll find out sooner or later." John said as he looked at Michelle's naked body.</p> <p>"You really think?" Michelle replied as her face turned beet red with embarrassment.</p> <p>"Well, my friend is about thirty feet away. I want to see you again. Now."</p> <p>John took Michelle in front of him and moved her over to the end of the bed. He unbuttoned her shirt slowly and slowly. Michelle was so turned on that her breasts were almost out of sheer lace. He moved her breasts up and down slowly, as if trying to get a feel for size. Michelle kept moaning and humping her hips as he moved over to the other side of the bed. Michelle's hands moved slowly all over his back as his shirt was removed by one of her hands. Michelle moved her hand over John's back and his tight jeans. Michelle slid her hand down under John's shirt and felt his stomach. His body was very tight and she felt his muscles on her hand.</p> <p>"So, you're wearing underwear?"</p> <p>Michelle nodded and pushed John's arms back over his head, giving her better access to his back than she wanted. Her hands moved in a more urgent manner, as if taking revenge on all the bad boys that bullied her last year. John was not sure what Michelle had done to her panties, but it was definitely a lot worse than Michelle had told him in their first meeting.</p> <p>The bra was a bit heavy and a lot uncomfortable around Michelle's breasts, her breasts were small and they were firm. John was glad for Michelle when she asked him out again. Even though he couldn't see Michelle's face, he could tell that she wasn't looking at him as his eyes met hers.</p> <p>"I want to see, what we're doing this time." Michelle said as she turned herself around to face her back to John's body. With both hands she removed his shirt revealing those gorgeous tits.</p> <p>"Nice!" John said as his hands reached behind Michelle's naked body and undid her bra. John grabbed her breasts with both hands and squeezed them as he continued to squeeze her. Michelle began to move her hands and slowly moved her face down to John's chest. The sight of her naked breasts caused a strange sensation as if she wanted to rub herself through her panties.</p> <p>"Can I?" Michelle teased in a seductive tone as she licked her lips.</p> <p>"Uh...Yeah. Yeah you can." John said as he pushed Michelle down to the side on her back. He lifted her knees and spread her legs apart. John placed his face between her legs and looked directly into Michelle's eyes.</p> <p>"How many orgasms do we have before we have too many drinks?" John asked in question. John held Michelle's ankles and pushed her calves to her shoulders.</p> <p>John then moved his mouth so that Michelle's body was just a couple of inches from his mouth. Michelle's moans started to get a little louder and John knew that she would go with the flow. Michelle reached down to touch John's cock and it was stiff before he even said the word "cock".</p> <p>Michelle guided his cock head by its side and John let out a small moan. John lifted Michelle's legs so that they were on his shouldersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
