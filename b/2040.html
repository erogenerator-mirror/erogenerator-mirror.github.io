I wasn't ready to call off the session so early in the day but I needed to get some more paperwork done today so I needed to check up on her.</p> <p>******</p> <p>As I headed off to work to write up my report card I thought about how the day had gone. My first impression had been a mixture of nerves, anxiety, and excitement. I wasn't sure that I was going to go through with this. It had been a long day but we were both happy in our own, albeit temporary, ways.</p> <p>Once I got to work, I found Susan and got a hug from her.</p> <p>"Good afternoon, honey. Thank you for an enjoyable day," she said.</p> <p>"I couldn't be happier, sweetheart. You got me back in the car. Thank you for this day. Will you come back for more?"</p> <p>"Absolutely," she said as we hugged each other again.</p> <p>******</p> <p>We returned to our room and once again I got to work as usual reviewing my report card. I left the room heading directly to the office phone. I was just about to call my secretary in for a consultation when Susan's cell phone vibrated on the third ring.</p> <p>"Hello," she said as she picked up from her desk.</p> <p>"I want to ask you something, Mrs."</p> <p>I laughed and said. "Go ahead. It's important."</p> <p>She frowned for a moment and then said. "I need to talk to you in my office. I'm going to be alone."</p> <p>"But ... I don't really want to see you."</p> <p>"No, wait," she interrupted me. "I mean ..."</p> <p>I nodded, not wanting to interrupt her.</p> <p>"Are you ... having another affair?" she said in a whisper.</p> <p>"Well ..." I paused. "Yes ... I am," I replied honestly.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, then hung up the phone. "Do you want me to come and see it? It was my idea to ask you. Are you free tomorrow afternoon?"</p> <p>"Yes, if that is OK."</p> <p>******</p> <p>I took the elevator up to the third floor and opened the door. I had already taken off my t-shirt and was carrying my suit bag. We sat on the sofa chatting about nothing in particular, with me casually tossing my t-shirt aside. She was staring at me intently, looking me up and down.</p> <p>"I've been married 20 years and I've never once seen the man I love. Don't get me wrong, I like it. But for some reason I never really felt that way toward you. I'm not sure about sex. I think that I need sex to make me lose my inhibitions and control. Maybe I'm the cause of that."</p> <p>She gave me another dirty look and then said. "But we're not married. So why do you feel bad?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure. I know that I never acted on my feelings about you, and I may not like what I did. I'm sure that I didn't get the impression that something like this is going to be hard on you when I see you."</p> <p>Susan smiled and gently took my hand in hers. "I want you to remember that I'm with you as much as you are. I didn't want that to happen today, for any real reason. I just wanted you to have a nice day. I've had a lot on my mind and I know that you have had a lot on your mind, too."</p> <p>"Thank you, Susan," I returned her smile, and then said, "but I don't think that I like you right now. It's getting a bit personal. I would like to have a serious talk."</p> <p>She nodded and then said, "OK. I was hoping you'd say that. I've got a surprise for you. The other women that I've had try to have sex with me, but I've got it a bit more complicated."</p> <p>"I'm not in any hurry to find out any of that," I said, "I'm quite ready to start the business. What do you want to know?"</p> <p>"Have you made you first love?" she asked.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Yes, I have. That will start at the other end, but you really should hear what the surprise is."</p> <p>She looked disappointed so I waited patiently.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how to do that," she said.</p> <p>"Can we start off slowly?" I asked, "Let me think. I'm not a big woman so I can think with my little headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
