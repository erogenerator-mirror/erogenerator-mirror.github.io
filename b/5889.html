The feeling of his hardness on my body was even better. He was fully aroused. I ran my hands over his body and gently caressed his erection, which was beginning to harden.</p> <p>It was like a light bulb went off in my head and I looked at myself in the mirror. I looked like an older version of myself, wearing a thin robe and wearing a red bikini under it. But for the most part, it was the red bra that really made me look older. It hugged my body, accentuating my bust, ass cheeks and upper thighs.</p> <p>I thought how much I would love to have it on again, but for some reason I didn't want to start it over again. I felt that I should give him the pleasure he could have that evening, but I knew that he wouldn't be able to stop what was next.</p> <p>I felt him move on the bed, straddling my naked form, with his arms on either side of my neck, kissing me as he continued to fondle his own aroused erection.</p> <p>I could feel my panties getting wet all over again as his tongue found my tongue and entered it. As he continued kissing me at the same time he was sliding down over my body, I could feel his warm breath against my stomach. His tongue traced a path from my stomach to my crotch, tickling and tickling, making my legs tremble.</p> <p>I was getting close, when I felt his hips raise and he entered me from behind, pulling his hardness into my body as he slid in and out, each thrust sending pleasure into my entire body. It was like my whole body could feel his warm wet cock as he slowly withdrew, then re-applied his hot hard penis to my vagina again.</p> <p>I was moaning as each stroke was accompanied by light kisses along my jaw and lips and neck. He would kiss my soft breasts and rub the tip of his erection against mine in that position. When his penis moved over my clitoris, he would suck my clitoris and let his tongue penetrate me. He would suck and slide his penis and hold my lips as he kissed me, then suck me back into his body again.</p> <p>His strong hands kept up their pace, pumping his manhood in and out of me. My pussy was starting to ache with every stroke, I could feel myself getting tighter and tighter with every stroke. My body would be trembling and I needed him to stop. I could feel myself going over the edges on his shaft. It was getting too intense.</p> <p>I was ready, it was time. And I needed him in me.</p> <p>Slowly, in a short time, he raised himself over me, allowing my legs to come out and allow him more space. He took his penis and laid it on mine for the first time. He began to stroke it, caressing my clitoris slowly with his cock and caressing my breasts. He looked at me, and said:</p> <p>"I can't believe how I feel about you, Lisa. You were such a good student, so quick to learn things with your hands. It was like being with a woman again."</p> <p>"Thanks for the compliment," I replied, "I enjoyed the best part of the evening. I wish you would teach me how to give good pleasure. Will you teach me to fuck you?" "Yes, but it will have to be before we can do a more special thing."</p> <p>As he continued gently caressing my clitoris, I could feel myself starting to lose control. I wanted him to fuck me but didn't want to lose my virginity to a complete stranger.</p> <p>He could sense my excitement and said:</p> <p>"No, that last part is much more valuable now. I love to touch you and you give me pleasure."</p> <p>I could feel his erection growing inside mine and I knew it was time. He slid into me slowly and it was heaven. I had wanted that for a long time and it was time for it to happen. My body started to tremble at every stroke and the feeling was fantastic. I felt the wetness of my vagina as it touched his hardness.</p> <p>I felt like I would ejaculate at anytime, I was so horny, but could not hold myself any longer. I needed him, I needed him in me, and I was ready to cum again, I needed his cock in me so bad. I closed my eyes and I felt the warmth of my orgasm. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. I was about to climax again from the feeling of his erection filling every single part of my very being. It was like it was a warm moist warmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
