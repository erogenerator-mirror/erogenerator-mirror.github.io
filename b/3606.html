I think that's quite an impressive cock I think. Do you have any idea how long it is?"</p> <p>"I've seen the size of it. Maybe a little longer, thicker. And it was quite big in most cases." She grinned, "It was in fact a really large one. Are you sure one of them is as big as it seems?"</p> <p>"They both are. How about you?"</p> <p>"Well, actually, I have to admit I've never had big or small dicks before, but I find it's so much of a turn-on that it's almost as much about taking it as it is about giving it. I've also had a couple of bigger ones but they were a bit awkward, just like you are about an inch and a half. "A couple different sized ones, maybe, but never any bigger but I don't think any of them were as deep inside me as you are."</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure you can learn to love bigger ones, too."</p> <p>I couldn't believe how my girlfriend was taking all of that. I began to wonder how she was going to tell me about my dick size if she wasn't already going to let me fuck her after she gave me an example.</p> <p>"I've always wondered if women could go double-teaming. Do you think a woman could be that long, let alone stretch as much as you can inside her?"</p> <p>By the end of that discussion all I could think was that this was something I would have to try again sometime. As much as I was beginning to like her as soon as possible I needed a little distraction and, as soon as the thought of sex with one of our friend's hit my brain, I decided to just do it, right here, right now and see where the relationship between our friendship goes from there. With that going hand, I looked out the window into the darkening sky while I started fucking my girlfriend back again, getting closer to her goal.</p> <p>"Don't you think we should try to save some of that for later?" She asked suddenly. I nodded and moved onto the mattress again. My cock had been hard a little before, but I was so ready for my girlfriend that I hadn't felt it go down to my knees until then.</p> <p>"What do you think?"</p> <p>"I think so, but don't you think this first time first time would be a bit more meaningful - you know, in my position?"</p> <p>I was about to argue with her. Instead, I moved back to her side and reached down and found her hands. She was holding my hands so I moved my hand to hers and pressed our bodies together. I could feel the side of her breast pressing against me.</p> <p>"I want to be more specific. It really is only fair that we try to be as much of a part of our friendship as we can be."</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed and kissed her again. The feel of her lips pressed to mine was so sensual that I was surprised when her tongue, which was in her mouth, slipped in and rubbed against mine. As we kissed, I slowly moved my penis back into position and started pushing into her. Her hand wrapped around mine and pulled. This seemed to be almost a reflex, but I could feel her squeeze her eyes shut as she felt for my cock, but she didn't push. She was clearly still thinking ahead. Her eyes opened just a bit and she began to kiss me again. Then she stopped kissing me, however, and whispered, "Let me get my pants off."</p> <p>I was pretty shocked and a bit worried about whether anyone else could hear us and how far we were going to get, but I figured I might as well get comfortable because I really liked the feelings of our kissing. I pulled out of her and she leaned back, taking mine with her, and we pulled her pants down a bit. When we had her legs in position, I got all the way in her and pulled back but didn't move. She didn't move or say anything, so I just looked at her. The first time I'd ever been able to say something like that about a woman, and the last time I'd actually said so, I'd been a little bit timid.</p> <p>"Did you like me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes. Do you like me?"</p> <p>"Yes, I love your body, it's perfect and warm inside." She didn't look at me as I was finishing the statement of my choice. She reached out and took my hand in hers. I kept going in and then pulled almost all the way out. She kept looking at me but didn't say anything. Then she leaned forward and kissed me again.</p> <p>I stopped her kisses and put my hands under her armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
