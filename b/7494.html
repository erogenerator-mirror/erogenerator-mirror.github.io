He then took her panties off and put them on the floor. "So do you feel better now?"</p> <p>"Yes!" she replied in a tone that conveyed confidence and acceptance.</p> <p>He took the panties from her and put them on her face. Then he stood and began rubbing her shoulders. She relaxed a little and he began to rub the lower slope of her breast. The feel of the cold fabric against her body and even the slight breeze caused her nipples to rise in anticipation. The fabric pressed up against her breasts which allowed her to feel his warm hand. She couldn't resist the urge to rub herself against the fabric and her hands shook when she did so.</p> <p>"Are you enjoying the sensation?" he asked.</p> <p>Again with the voice that sounded slightly unsure, she replied, "I think so. It feels good."</p> <p>He continued to rub a hand lightly against the outside of her breast. She felt the sensation there and even began to squirm. He touched her and she moaned. His fingers then traveled down her body to caress just her nipple. Then he slowly began rolling the stiff nub between his fingers and watching the reaction of her face as his finger stroked back and forth. She was breathing hard and it wasn't lost on him as he touched her other nipple, rubbing both at the same time. He was feeling her nipples harden and knew that he had found the one he was looking for. She moaned and arched her back a little. That was all it took and he slowly moved his hand down her body.</p> <p>Not wasting any time, he undid his pants and let them drop. His eyes never broke their gaze with hers; she felt the first glimpse of him when he sat beside her.</p> <p>They both sat there for a long moment, just enjoying the feel of one another. Neither felt ready to move. Finally, she spoke. "You've got a very nice dick, Tom. Does that bother you?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, it doesn't. I've never been with a woman."</p> <p>"Why then?"</p> <p>"You're married?"</p> <p>"Yes. But the men...they couldn't wait."</p> <p>"Neither could I."</p> <p>"I guess they don't. I mean they like to tease me. I guess it's not as good as men."</p> <p>"No. Yes, it is. It's still new, but it looks good."</p> <p>"Then lets see what it feels like," she said with a smile.</p> <p>Tom just nodded and allowed her to pull her panties down. He watched her closely as she began to step out of them and then, once they were halfway down, turned to face the table, bent and picked them up. He looked up at her in confusion. "Where did...they..." He faltered as she walked around him and placed them and his shoes on one of the nearby chair's edge. "Put them on my lap." She did not wait for his reply; she was already on her knees before him. He looked at her with surprise.</p> <p>"I don't think this is what you like, Tom?"</p> <p>"God, no. It's not what you think at all."</p> <p>"Are you sure it's what I think?"</p> <p>"Yes!" he finally managed to say.</p> <p>She looked up at him and gave him a sly smile. "If you are, I'll give you a kiss." As she said it, the tip of her tongue flicked out and licked his lips. He looked down and felt his eyes drop to her chin. She took his hands in hers and placed them on her shoulders. He slowly reached up until they met in front of her. He felt her tremble slightly at the feeling of his fingers. She looked up at him and kissed him on the lips. It was a soft kiss and he felt the warmth of her mouth, almost as though her tongue was caressing him. The kiss lasted a long time, their lips and tongues dancing in each other for many minutes. The sensation of her tongue on his lips, the feel of her cheek against his, the smell of her hair combined with the feeling of her hot breath in his face.</p> <p>Then her kisses stopped. They stood holding each other in silence again. Tom reached to gently caress her face. The touch sent shivers all through his body. She could feel it from the tips of his fingers.</p> <p>"You shouldn't be done," he said.</p> <p>He looked down at her and could see that she was looking up at him with a questioning expression in her eyes, so he continued.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter to you that everything my body is feeling is sexual. That's why you're looking up at me right nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
