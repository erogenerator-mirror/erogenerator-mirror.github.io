You're late."</p> <p>You turned around and I was grinning. You're so cute!</p> <p>-</p> <p>We were walking in the park towards the river. You were making that adorable, all-but-naked, pose with your arms spread wide. At the very end of it, I reached down and caught the hem of your dress up around your waist.</p> <p>-</p> <p>I knew you weren't wearing any underwear. Your sweet little butt was pressed hard against the cold stones and my erection throbbed. In my lustrous blue silk robe, your body was in full view.</p> <p>I could feel your breath on my cheek, and your eyes were watching me up and down. Your long hair fell down over your lovely shoulders, and you were still wearing that tiny little sundress that you were wearing that day, so we never had seen each other in it before. Even though it was a cool morning, and it looked like it was getting cold, your body was shivering in your dress, and you looked so beautiful that I could feel my heart speed up. I'd never felt so vulnerable before.</p> <p>I stepped away from you. Your eyes were glistening with desire. "Come on, sweetheart." I said, taking your hand and leading you away. You followed behind me.</p> <p>We climbed the rocks one by one until our feet were up in the clear blue water. You stood there, looking at me, your head tilted up and your eyes wide, your hair falling over her shoulder, the cool blue water lashing her pretty body. I held out my arms for you. You dropped to both knees. I was going to do exactly what was expected of me, and I lifted our dresses up around your waist. There was a moment of resistance, as if you were afraid you would get wet.</p> <p>I slid forward and took your head between two hands - with one hand, holding the backs of your head, and the other running over the swell of your breasts. Just like the day we met in a store during the day, you were trembling. I bent forward and kissed you hard on the mouth. My tongue ran along your lips. I had always wondered what it would feel like to kiss you like that, when I knew I could do it very, very well.</p> <p>I didn't want to rush anything, but now, as we stood there, like two hungry wild-beasts clinging to a tree for shelter from the cold, I had no idea whether we were in danger. But there were two things that mattered. The first was to have you. I wanted to please you. The second was to finally have you in my arms.</p> <p>-</p> <p>I kissed you again. I'm not sure exactly when it happened. I thought we were the only ones at the picnic, and I was hoping to see something when I was in the middle of making love with you. I could feel your body shaking from the excitement and the anticipation. Your hands went up to my chest and you were pressing my fingers and hands together, and I knew you were really getting carried away.</p> <p>We kissed, and you rubbed your body against me, and I felt the stiffness of your nipples pressing into me. I'd never known you to be this excited before, and for some unexplainable reason, your body suddenly got stiffer.</p> <p>We were making out on the beach. I'm not even sure what made me do it, but I reached down and stroked my fingers down between your legs and felt the warmth there. I stroked your clit through you, and my touch sent shivers up and down your spine - your eyes squeezed shut, your mouth open, you were panting, and I knew you were getting close - just like the day we met, but a few hours ago.</p> <p>But this isn't what I wanted - now I'm driving myself insane thinking I could be fucking you forever. I could be kissing you forever.</p> <p>-</p> <p>I got up, and pulled my clothes off. I wanted to make love to you. The desire was almost unbearable. You seemed to want that, too. Your body was shaking as I walked across the warm sand towards you. My erection was already pointing down the small of your back, and I leaned forward to kiss you again. I could see the top of your little head. You'd been aching for it today, when I'd seen the way you were squirming.</p> <p>-</p> <p>When we were out on that beach at the lake, I couldn't believe we were going to do anything, but when I put my hand on your thigh, you reached down and helped me take my hand away.</p> <p>- "I want you to come with me," I said.</p> <p>- "Oh, honey...are weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
