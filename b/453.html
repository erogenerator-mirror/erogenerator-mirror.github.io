Just look at that huge thing up close. Don't even try." And he was rubbing it against her slit. "That goes right up to my balls. And I can smell it..." He leaned forward and licked his fingers off, smiling.</p> <p>"I didn't realize you were a guy, Jackie." He stood up and pulled her close and kissed her gently. "Do you want Jackie to shave your little cunt tonight? Because I've got something special for you, too."</p> <p>She laughed and kissed him again, wrapping her arms around his neck as he pulled them tightly together. "Yes, please!" She giggled, and he looked so incredibly happy. "Jackie, baby, I don't know if I'll ever be able to tell how much I love you. Don't you worry about that..."</p> <p>"Oh, please... Jackie, no one will ever know! If something ever happens, do you want to tell them, or just hang on?" Jackie's breathing was becoming faster. His eyes stared deeply into hers. He knew she loved him, but he couldn't wait for their relationship to develop until they were married.</p> <p>"No, no, don't worry... it'll be perfect for me. Just give me a few minutes, baby, maybe after..."</p> <p>"Jackie, what are you doing?" Jackie looked at him pleadingly, and he leaned against her as she ran her fingers up and down her soft, wiry hair. His hands came up to hold her face as she kissed him again, long and hard, but tenderly as her hands came up and slid into his hair and her hips pressed their bodies together. "I want you to tell me to put it in, Jackie. It's all you can think of anyway, but you know you'll never want me to do this." And her eyes were shining. "You've made me so happy... so happy."</p> <p>He looked at her with a huge smile on his face. "Yes, I think I know, baby." He pulled her close and kissed her passionately. He knew she was ready for another climax tonight, and he was not letting go of her until she was satisfied.</p> <p>Then he stopped his kisses and looked at her. She was trembling. He smiled again. "Are you ready, sweetheart?"</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhh..." She kissed him again, and his hand slid down between her legs and rubbed her little clitoris. She let out a little cry, but held still as he began to rub her in earnest. He felt her excitement increasing, but he kept at her, watching her face as he pleasured her. "Oh, Jackie, you are so beautiful, with such a beautiful face..."</p> <p>She pulled her mouth away, gasping as he continued to rub her clitoris. "Do I make you happy?"</p> <p>"Yes, baby, I'm so happy.. I didn't know it could feel so good until I just got it in you." He felt her juices flowing down his hand as she reached a climax. It made him hotter than any climax he'd ever felt, and he could feel the heat and wetness of her vagina on his fingers. He had never felt this good from a woman, and he knew he would never let her go, and he would gladly spend the rest of his life with her. "Oh, Jackie," she whispered, looking at him.</p> <p>He pulled her down on top of him, smiling up at her. "Thank you, baby, thank you." He felt her little wet tongue lick up and down his shaft and his erection grew at the feeling: he loved the feel of her warm mouth on him, and he let her go where she had. "I just want you to keep going and you will always be in the best place to feel amazing."</p> <p>Just then, he turned his head and found her looking at him with her wide eyes. "Did you like that, Jackie? Did you like that feeling inside you? Did you feel the incredible orgasm you had when I did it to you? You can't imagine how much you had enjoyed it, and your mind is completely blank."</p> <p>"It was absolutely incredible, Jackie." Her face had turned a little dark, like it always did when she made him feel like he should be feeling guilty, and yet she seemed so confident and proud that it was okay to make him feel this way. She leaned down and kissed him on the lips, and she kissed him more than before. Her voice was a bit slurred, as if she was feeling weak and out of place, but she had to do it. He kissed her back as his other hand found her breasts.</p> <p>She put an arm around his neck, holding his head as she kissed him again, but just as they were about to say goodnightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
