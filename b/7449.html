"I was wondering," she mused, "where you found the woman, how she got away from the man who attacked her, and what prompted you to come here."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," I smiled, "it wasn't your fault"</p> <p>"And what makes your dear friend of years more of a fool than I am isn't it? You are a young man who has been lost without a girl," I said. "So, have you any idea how you got here, without being raped for God's sake?"</p> <p>"Not really," she replied, "I guess when in the back of your car, you could say it. And no, it's not rape. You're my first boyfriend, by the way. I was just going to get you ready for the first time."</p> <p>"Well, that shouldn't be surprising" I smiled. "Your first experience being raped was a rather traumatic experience for you. But, don't worry, you mustn't regret it, for I have seen many women being raped. And they have all been in this condition before."</p> <p>"But that was a long time ago," Emily argued, "and it seemed so long ago. This is why I am here now."</p> <p>"Well, just relax," I said, "I think I can help you understand something here."</p> <p>I reached into my lap and opened two small drawers, holding out her old vibrating dildo.</p> <p>"It was used in Vietnam, when I was about five years old."</p> <p>Emily held her hand to her face. "I don't understand," she replied, "But it is still something to me. I didn't remember it being there."</p> <p>"It's a beautiful dildo," I smiled, "a very special and special toy"</p> <p>"It's too nice, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Actually, I'm not sure," I replied, "but I am sure it needs servicing, and a lot of women need to be fucked. You are the woman that has to do it, so it is up to you to do the job. After some coaxing, the men will take a turn with you."</p> <p>I took my dildo out, and sat it on the end table, next to where Emily had laid it out. I sat next toward her on the couch.</p> <p>"Well?" I asked, "Did everything you remember?" I asked. "Everything?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I replied, "that is how they keep the 'gift' of women here." I pointed to a small box on the table. "These are our favorite items."</p> <p>"So, I was still your first girlfriend?" Emily asked.</p> <p>I laughed. "No, you were probably last lover" I answered, "and here I was planning to introduce you to a bunch of different men. You had a pretty good time."</p> <p>"I hope so," she replied, "because I just hope you don't turn me into a total doped-up prostitute."</p> <p>"Well, not only that, but you'll have a fantastic experience," I replied, "and a fantastic future in the making."</p> <p>Emily thought for a few moments.</p> <p>"You're kidding," she said.</p> <p>"No, not kidding. We've been through this sort of thing before. I just have to try it again. And again."</p> <p>"If you don't mind," Emily offered, "why not."</p> <p>"And I'd like this to be your first experience too, isn't that right, baby?" I asked, "Let me turn off the vibrator now, I'm sure you have a nice time, while we wait."</p> <p>Emily quickly got out of her clothes, and we sat down with my hand guiding the dildo as I spoke.</p> <p>"How about you, what did you do about the experience you had in Vietnam?" I said, "Were some of the women really afraid you were going to be hurt and killed? In retrospect, and I can't wait until we can talk more, let's say, now that there is a man, who is now, a hundred fold, that can be trusted to have a few moments of privacy in his own bed with you, is that right?"</p> <p>"Yes," Emily spoke again, "I trust you with that, but I also have a pretty good idea what we are going to do."</p> <p>I smiled. "So, I'd like this first time with the woman, to make sure I'm not just being nice, but giving you a good time too, with just a little more respect, and affection."</p> <p>Emily smiled and kissed me gently on the lips. "Oh, that would be wonderful."
