I yelled at her, "I'm not going to let you do that! You know that I'd be a dead man if you did that!"</p> <p>"I'm not going to lie to you about that," she smiled, "And you're already guilty enough in your own mind to think of this as something you could do to me! It's you're cocky, self control like that. You can't be the type to let it get away!"</p> <p>She leaned towards me, taking a breath of air. She was breathing hard but looked like she had trouble breathing herself. "What? How? What makes you think I just made you cum? Or something?" I was trying to calm her down! She was a hot looking young woman! She might be in her early fifties but she was still really sexy! I could not help myself when I took a whiff of her! She smelled of her perfume! I had to stop playing this game!</p> <p>"I thought it was just you, so I just thought it was you. And I never even thought about it. I don't know what came over me," she replied, looking deep into my eyes "But it turned into what I want in me!" She pushed away from me and ran out of the room, leaving me to watch her move. Maybe I would be able to handle that when I got home!</p> <p>After my shower I decided to try and clean myself up a bit, hoping to see her again and for another chance to get back into her pants so we could be together again! I knew that that would get me a blow-job to end all blow-jobs after what she did.</p> <p>I got dressed and went to bed. The next day I found Jenny and Susan in the living room watching a movie on the TV! They were sitting in a comfortable armchair facing each other.</p> <p>"Honey, I couldn't go through with it! Don't look at me like that, please?" I had to stop and talk to them both, "Oh, well, maybe it's not fair. I'm not a cuckold, after all! Anyway, now that I see your hot body instead of just your pussy, I'm really starting to like how you look now!</p> <p>Susan leaned over the other chair to kiss me, "What?" I asked. "You know what I meant. You've got great tits; the dress shows them off, well they're definitely nice!" I turned to look at her and could see her nipples straining at the top of her low-cut dress at the thought. "Well!" she said.</p> <p>"Uh, I'm sorry? I don't mind. I just mean you look great." I could tell that she was getting excited at the sight of the other's eyes, the desire to have a peek at her tits again.</p> <p>"I know it looks great, and you look great too, but I love your eyes on me, I love them, that's all." She leaned back and pulled her dress away from the other's gaze.</p> <p>I watched her for a few seconds as she pulled her dress down and sat down on the corner of the chair in front of me. Her legs were parted as the material rode up to her mid-shaved mound, showing the top of her puffy pussy lips. I could see the moisture of her womanly essence as the material pulled away from her body.</p> <p>"You look so hot!" I could tell that Susan was getting a lot more excited by the second. She was rubbing her fingers down her cleft, spreading her legs as much as she could get them, pulling her dress higher on her thigh at the top of it.</p> <p>I looked at her face. The desire in her eyes was overwhelming. She was almost as if she were looking to see if I was still there. She pulled back on her top for a second.</p> <p>"I'm really glad that you are here, you are all I need right now!" She leaned over the arm of the chair and rested her hand on my shoulder. "I'm really glad you're here!"</p> <p>"Me too!" I sat back on the chair and looked at the other couple on the couch. "Where is my son?"</p> <p>"In his room, sweetheart. Let's go see if he's still asleep!" Jenny spoke up.</p> <p>"Oh goody!" Susan put her arm around me. "So is he asleep yet?" When I did not say anything she leaned over so that we could kiss again.</p> <p>I turned the other way to kiss Susan and our lips were on a full level. "You're still so beautiful, aren't you?" I asked her.</p> <p>"So are you," She replied.</p> <p>"Thanks!" I returned the kiss.</p> <p>We continued to kiss and caress for a long timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
