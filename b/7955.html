She came hard and long, as the cum that hit the back of my throat was so hard it actually shot through me. I swallowed her seed and held her tight as she continued to orgasm. I lifted myself off her and she fell to her knees, trying to catch her breath and recover from her climax.</p> <p>Beth turned her head and looked at me with her eyes wide and her mouth open. "Wow!!! That was incredible! Holy...."</p> <p>"It was. Did that feel good?"</p> <p>"Oh god yes, that was so awesome for me to cum like that! You were unbelievable!
