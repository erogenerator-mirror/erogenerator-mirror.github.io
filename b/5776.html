I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, just a little tired. Why? Is my back bothering you?"</p> <p>"It's just that I'm never really good with physical stuff."</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I asked, taking off my shirt and lying down next to Ann. She lay down with a big shit-eating grin on her face, laying next to me. "Where did you learn that?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, my mom told me everything, too. Mom says I should come out with her more often. She says everything feels amazing now that we live in this neighborhood."</p> <p>"Oh, that's what I meant at the grocery store," I said.</p> <p>"What did she mean?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement.</p> <p>"She said that after your mom gave me back rubs that I should take advantage of your mom's generosity and help her out more."</p> <p>"Really?" she asked, eyes locked on mine.</p> <p>"Oh yes," I said, smiling at her.</p> <p>"So do you take massage?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, I don't do anything but work out. I do like getting a guy off but all he's looking at is my butt or feet."</p> <p>She laughed.</p> <p>"Do you do it? I mean, does your sister usually do this?"</p> <p>"Not all the time. She is always nice to me; I'm just not as good with it. I mean, I didn't want you to think that all the girls in school were that good with it, so here I am," I joked.</p> <p>Ann rolled over and leaned over me, kissing me on the lips.</p> <p>"You don't have to think so hard," she told me.</p> <p>"I don't think it's really hard. I'm good with my body," I said, "but really don't need a lot of massages."</p> <p>"I guess that's because you aren't too skinny here," she said, "but you have to do a lot more than you can handle."</p> <p>Ann straddled me, her back and neck arched in the middle of the bed. She leaned down and kissed me again, licking my lips. She kissed her way down my neck, leaving trails of hot kisses from my collarbone. She let her right hand wander over my stomach, stopping just before my pubic bone. She kept at my navel, her fingers going a little way into my pubic hair when she went back for a quick nip or two.</p> <p>Ann sat back up, running her fingertips over my chest, my hardening nipples. She leaned down and ran her tongue slowly around each toothed nipple in turn.</p> <p>"Ooohh," I moaned, "that feels nice, Ann."</p> <p>Ann moved her head and sucked my nipple into her mouth and rolled it around with her tongue, licking the areola and sucking on it lightly with her teeth. I closed my eyes and enjoyed it all while Ann knelt between my legs and kissed her way down my stomach and down again, kissing along my body and making a trail of wet kisses with her tongue. When she got to my thighs she stopped just short of my dick and began to lick around it, kissing with her tongue, occasionally stopping to suck on the tip.</p> <p>She kissed along the inside of each thigh again, and got to my balls.</p> <p>"I love having my balls stimulated," Ann said, licking a finger and placing it at the base of my dick. She rubbed the wet finger on top of my dick, making a few other motions.</p> <p>"What's doing!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"It's just like a man touching another man's cock," Ann said, a little slyly, "don't you know it?" She said, leaning back to lie on her back, "and you never know what might come up."</p> <p>She lifted her hips up and off the bed.</p> <p>"Now," she said, "here's how I like it." She spread her legs wide apart, putting her feet on top of me and putting her hands at the back of my head. She kissed me passionately, running her right hand across my chest, pushing her pussy down over my face as a small sigh escapes from her lips. She placed her right leg over my shoulder and leaned back again, pulling her chest to me. While she was still kissing me, one hand rubbed the sides of my cock, and the other moved down slowly, rubbing my balls gently while she did so.</p> <p>Ann continued to kiss me and her body was moving toward me, trying to get me to eat her. I'm not sure if this is what is meant by eating a womanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
