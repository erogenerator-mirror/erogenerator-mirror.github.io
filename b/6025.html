Do you smell like that? We're both so messy."</p> <p>"Yeah, I do. It's kind of like old perfume. There's a little blood on your nose, on my shirt--and there's even some wet spot in my pants."</p> <p>"Oh...yeah, I guess it's kind of a shame that the way I smell, when you got back from lunch, the way they acted, about me being the other woman's boyfriend. I don't think anything else would be the same."</p> <p>I felt a bit like a gaggle of school girls. I mean I still had my panties on--I must have worn them all day...and I just knew they would never stop smelling that way. And that's what all that was that night. I'd been so nervous all day. When I got home last night I could hear the two of them talking--they must have kissed deeply, because when I did see my cum on the end of his cock his wife kept talking about how cute it'd be to fuck me in his bed again...and that they would keep talking about how they'd cum in me next time. Well that was really great, it brought me real joy to watch their lovemaking. I couldn't stop thinking about their lovemaking the night before. That night I was so happy.</p> <p>When I told her about the kiss, she actually leaned forward and kissed me. Actually let her lips touch my neck while she had her hand on my breast. I felt like I was going out of my mind in that instant of time. I was almost there, just thinking of it. I guess I wasn't supposed to react so quickly, but she had me there, in another way. She was so gentle--she kissed so slowly down my chest—and she kissed at my nipples and I let out a muffled moan. I had to tell her to stop--to tell me to keep kissing me, I wanted to feel those soft lips kiss me again...but that meant more. Like I should have said something at school because I might have gotten an A.</p> <p>She moved down, kissing my stomach, leaving it wet with love. Then she was kissing my pussy--it was so sweet. I really liked kissing her while she was kissing--I had to let out a soft groan as she began to suck my labia. It felt so different from when we were with boys. I felt like I could do anything I wanted to her--I really wanted to go down on her and have her suck my clitoris...I could do so much more. She did that thing with my fingers so fast she could barely touch them to touch down her tongue to my clitoris. It did really feel so good--it was like nothing I'd ever seen and I'd never felt anything like it.</p> <p>She was really going at me now, sucking my pussy, rubbing my clit with her lips at the same time. She had really done her thing--now she was going to kiss me down there.</p> <p>"Mmmhmm...ahmm...mmmmh...mmhmm...ahh," was all I could say at that point.</p> <p>She stopped to lick her way back up to my breasts. She kissed my nipples at the same time--I felt like a kid at a small children' playground. I told her I liked it, that it felt so good. Her tongue was so soft and it felt so exciting to have it inside me at the same time. Our kissing got even wilder, almost like we were going to cum at the same time, when she took one of my pussy lips into her mouth. I'm not sure if I've ever cum so much in my life at that point. I was actually about to let loose. She sucked harder and sucked harder and I could feel it almost as though it was trying to bite me. I could tell it was getting close to the point where I would not be able to stop cumming. All I'd wanted since we started dating was to be in her bed, just right for me, in those wet pink panties. When I was about to explode she stopped and got up to look at me, a happy look on her face.</p> <p>"Baby, I don't know you like having it with someone else, but....that's exactly what you like! I feel as if I should tell you that you like it--and also have it with someone else. That's all you can ask for?"</p> <p>I laughed and said, "I like when you talk nasty sometimes...just don't let it get you down. It's not much fun having someone else in the way."</p> <p>"What do you mean?" she asked, looking a little hurt by that answer.</p> <p>"Well, sometimes it is really fun talking dirty to someone. Like I said, sometimes it is really fun, fun and exciting.
