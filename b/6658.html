I pushed my chest towards her, giving them the opportunity for one last peek at each breast. A thrill ran through me as my breasts collided with her. She was still wearing her skirt and her arms were still behind her back, though now there was a little more movement underneath. As we moved our bodies closer the smell of her skin drove me over the top and I felt myself squeal with delight.</p> <p>As our lips met, the two of us burst into laughter and we stood there, basking in the glow. She took a deep breath of her own and looked at me. She grinned and whispered a question to me. "You know, I can't tell if you or I get to choose between you and me."</p> <p>"I know" I nodded and she held out a finger, beckoning me to come with her. We started walking towards the nearest exit at the other end of the hallway.</p> <p>As we stood there in my hallway, I felt her arm tighten around my waist.</p> <p>"I'm glad you came" she whispered in my ear as she pressed her body closer to mine. Her lips were now on my neck and the feel of her hair against my bare back as we walked towards my room overwhelmed me with an excitement about which I never imagined.</p> <p>We walked into my room and I immediately fell onto my bed. When I woke up, I found her in the corner of the room, staring at me with a look that could have made me faint. The only thing that stopped me was her naked body, but it reminded me of who I should be looking at right then.</p> <p>"What happened?" I asked her quietly as she moved closer to me.</p> <p>"Nothing. I just thought you had something to tell me," she replied as her arms embraced me tightly. I returned her embrace and held on tight, enjoying the feel of her body against mine. It had been years since I had felt a physical attraction to anyone.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked as my hands dropped to her waist to feel the smoothness of her body.</p> <p>"You have a thing for me...you just told me," she whispered as she held me close. I could feel her soft warmth pressed against me.</p> <p>"And I've always considered it to be that," I replied softly.</p> <p>"You just did," she murmured as her body pressed against mine more firmly. Her hands pulled her top up over her breasts and I lifted mine away to look down at them. They stood perky and pert, and as my hands gently caressed them I could feel the taut feel of the nipples straining and pressing into my palms.</p> <p>I reached out and began to caress her breasts again and she shuddered slightly. I bent my head down to lick at her nipples and felt them jump as I licked around them. Her back arched and she moaned a little. I moved so that it was almost against my crotch as I sucked on her nipples and felt her hands on the back of my head gently pushing me forward. I continued my attentions around her breasts. She moaned again and pushed her hips upwards, thrusting her breasts towards my hands and allowing me to continue to rub against them.</p> <p>Finally, I sat her down on the bed and continued to lick her nipples some more as she spread her legs and pulled me in between them. She began to kiss me again and began to rub her body across mine. As her body rubbed against mine she slid her hand between us until she found my cock, which she then put up to her mouth.</p> <p>"Mmmmm..." she moaned into my lips and her tongue shot into my mouth, meeting with mine as she slid our tongues together, tasting each other. I reached out to cup one of her breasts as our bodies moved together and her hands moved down my body, feeling how muscular and toned and toned I was, while her fingers continued to rub all around my cock and my balls. She looked up into my eyes a little then and grinned as I reached down to pull her tight to me again. We continued to kiss for several moments, my tongue in her mouth and hers in mine. I pushed her back as I felt my cock rising against her.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and pulled me down until we were lying face to face and I could begin to kiss her neck. She moaned as she felt my lips moving down her smooth skin, feeling the heat radiate from her skin before moving down so that my lips could gently touch hers and feel the smoothness of her skin. She sighed with pleasure as my lips moved over her neck and into the hollow between her shoulder blades.</p> <p>"You're just as sweet and sweet as you said you were..." she whispered against my lips before taking my head in her hands and placing it just over her shoulders. She then started moving her body over mine a littleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
