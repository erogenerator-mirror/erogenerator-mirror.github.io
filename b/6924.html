Then I stood up, put my arms around her, and pulled her up against me as I lifted her skirt and panties off. A couple of minutes later she had her skirt and panties, which I put down on the floor and we stood face to face again and just looked into each other's eyes. I then moved closer so that my cock was right between her legs. As I slid it inside her, she put her hand on mine, and said "I want to make love to you."</p> <p>So, she slid down, and we moved together, first letting the weight of each other and then moving forward so that our bodies were pressed tightly together. And she did! We both moaned. "I love you" I whispered to her, just before we began to kiss. I put my tongue right down inside her mouth and began licking every square inch of her mouth. She began to squirm. We kissed for a long time. Our tongues danced together in a dance that neither of us could resist. And when we parted for a moment, there was a wetness between us. But this was a first date, and it was something much more intimate.</p> <p>We kissed a bit more, slowly, then I got a little bolder and we began to kiss more forcefully, pulling each other's face with our lips, trying to devour the other with a wild, passionate desire. We were so hot that our clothes were flying against each other, and we were so horny that we had to stop before we got the full story out of each other.</p> <p>"What am I doing?" she said, as she broke our embrace. "Are we getting too serious?"</p> <p>"This night has just begun" I said with a grin. Her expression was not one of confusion, but rather a challenge.</p> <p>"I have heard too much about you, but I don't think I'm getting the answers that I need. I'm very, very excited for this to happen." "I just know it's going to be great!"</p> <p>It was just now turning into a full-fledged date. We kissed for a long while for several minutes as she felt my excitement. But our physical desires could not be denied, no matter how much we wanted to feel each other's hands on another.</p> <p>We broke our kiss just long enough to take off all of our clothes. I turned her around and slowly kissed her from behind, from her neck up the crack of her bum and then back down to her shoulders. Then, I spread her cheeks and began licking her little pink hole for all the world to see.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" she said as she looked down and watched my tongue sliding in and out of her asshole. I moved my way back up and began kissing her bum again. Then I slowly, very slowly, pushed a finger inside her. She took it in very, very slowly, moving her ass back to meet it, as if she was trying to bring it in completely. So did I!</p> <p>We stayed in that position for a long while, and I could feel her muscles contracting and relaxing under my finger. I reached both hands around her and began working her vagina, but I stopped just short of her cervix with the fingers of one hand while I massaged her clit with the other.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, right there! Don't stop!" she said almost continuously as her body continued to tense and relax. I worked my finger in and out of her, while I massaged more pressure on her clit. She had reached back, her hands rubbing all over my body, and her breathing was getting heavy.</p> <p>She looked back to me, and I said "Do you want to come now?"</p> <p>"Well..." was all that escaped her mouth before she realized what she was saying. But she didn't have to finish the sentence. She just got it and said "Oh God."</p> <p>"Well, it's a little early for me to say that, but it's okay to admit it!"</p> <p>She smiled at that, then looked at me and said "I know what you mean – a little ahead for a little later." But she was not going to let me finish. She had said "A little ahead" as I'd said "a little back" as a second. She stopped a few seconds later, took my right hand in hers and turned it to get a closer look at what I was doing. Then she said "But first, we need to go back to the game room" and she pushed her bum a bit more to get them better aligned. We got out of the car, hand in hand, and walked to our own. And then we went back inside.</p> <p>After I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
