You are a natural; I'll take it."</p> <p>"I don't think you'll be surprised," Mabel said, "You will have a hard on if it is getting there, it's just not going away with me."</p> <p>She turned and led his hand off of her body and over to her breast which she didn't try to hide and he pulled on her nipple. Just before he had a good feel and his eyes closed he was surprised when he realized this time that there was a woman with her face just inches from his; a woman had her hand on his cock, she felt it and told him again that she didn't know if he would mind. He almost jumped a foot at their contact with his body.</p> <p>"Well Mabel," he said as he turned her to face him, "It seems that you really are ready for me to do something for you."</p> <p>She smiled at him and he slid his hand back down her torso. Up to her stomach to her mound. Her face was still hidden from his sight, but he could make out the look on her face as she felt his fingers reach for her clitoris. He moved the finger over the clit and back down to the lips. She was as aroused as he had remembered. They moved over her labia and then down his fingers. She was holding on to the edges of the couch and rocking her hips. He wanted to kiss her and touch her, but didn't. The other woman had turned and was staring at him with a big smile on her face.</p> <p>A woman was now on top of him, straddling his waist. She had her hands on his chest as she pushed herself back as she lifted her pussy from his cock. The woman was looking straight at him as she did it. She was obviously enjoying the show. He felt his own face burning with passion as he looked at her. She leaned down and kissed him as she looked at the woman on top of him. She moved as she kissed him, and the feel of her lips against his was a new experience for him. It wasn't that he didn't like it, but he was going to change that soon. It seemed that she had done that thing before too, she kissed him and then broke off the kiss, "Are you sure you want to do this?" she asked him, her look of seriousness on her face.</p> <p>"It's a first time, but it's worth it," he said with a smile.</p> <p>He put his arm around her, "It's going to be a great first time. I really want to."</p> <p>She pushed herself up. "Okay, I don't know what you mean by that."</p> <p>He picked her up and put her on the ground, and then pulled a dress over her head.</p> <p>"I can't believe I didn't do that before."</p> <p>"That doesn't matter," he said, "we're going to do this now." He went over to her and ran his fingers down her stomach, "Do you still want me to do this?"</p> <p>"Yes," she kissed him, "Yes. You can do this to me, anything you want. Please."</p> <p>"I think we're going to do everything you like now," he said as he slid his finger in her pussy and moved it around. He took his finger out and had Mabel put her hand to her face while he brought her fingers to her mouth; she put his finger back and licked it.</p> <p>He lifted her to her feet and led her to the bedroom and pulled on the clothes she liked to wear.</p> <p>"You want something sexy?" she cooed.</p> <p>"Do I?"</p> <p>"Might as well with you," she said and grabbed the top of the dress. She pulled it up over her head.</p> <p>"This dress?"</p> <p>"It is a little tight," she told him, "you can have me," she pulled on the dress and it had a bra hanging down.</p> <p>He pulled the bra and the dress together and it fit tight. "It's like wearing some kind of lacy see through nightgown without any panties on," he remarked as he pulled it on.</p> <p>"Oh," Mabel replied as she pulled the bra on and then reached under the dress to put a pair of stockings on; she pulled the dress over her head to cover herself. She was naked except for the stockings on her upper legs.</p> <p>She sat down and he turned her on her knees. He had on her own underwear for the first time in a long time. His face was only a few inches from her crotch, his hands holding on to her tits.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Of course I do; it's like the sexiest thing I have ever seenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
