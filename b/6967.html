She wanted to hurry and dress, but there was just a small box in her hand. She sat there and tore off two items of her clothing. Then she took the box full of clothes and pulled it out of the box and handed it to me, I looked at it and realized it was not just clothes, it was full clothing! The shirt had been taken off her, revealing her beautiful breasts. As she was buttoning up I could see that she was wearing a simple lace skirt and a thin silk cardigan.

Dana pulled into the parking lot, opened the door, and sat in my seat looking at me expectantly, as she didn't want to be early. When she saw me looking at her she said, " I think you're ready, baby, why don't we find a booth, right near the back?"</p> <p>I smiled at her and said, "Lead the wayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
