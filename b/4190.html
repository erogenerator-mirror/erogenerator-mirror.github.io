I should be here when I get back."</p> <p>"No wait. I'm on my way now. You go on home and see what is the matter, okay?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Great, just give me a little time. I need to get something else set up."</p> <p>"Okay. I'll be waiting here for you."</p> <p>"Thanks. I better go. See you tonight."</p> <p>"Okay. Love you."</p> <p>"Love you too."</p> <p>"Okay. Bye."</p> <p>She gave her a hug and wished him a good night.</p> <p>She stood to go back and she could see the truck and that was it. She grabbed her things and left without saying a word. She ran into the house to grab a towel and dry her face. She walked up the stairs and there in front of her was a man in his late 40s. She quickly walked up the stairs and walked close to him. "Oh shit" was all she could think to say as she looked up at him. She stared down at his muscular body, his dark hair and muscular arms but his eyes. She reached out and grabbed his cheek as she gave him a passionate hug and felt her face get hot. She felt her own nipples hardening under the towel as she rubbed her face against the muscular man's chest.</p> <p>"Holy shit. You are the guy of my dreams."</p> <p>"Well, I'm here now," he responded.</p> <p>"We need to talk about my date tonight," she asked him.</p> <p>"Sure. We can do whatever we want."</p> <p>They both looked at each other and smiled. They both knew by that point that he wanted to fuck her and now he was fucking her. She knew she would have to do something drastic to get him to be more than just willing.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I thought the way we were acting would be different."</p> <p>"It's okay. Let's just have a drink and talk and then go out."</p> <p>"Oh, okay."</p> <p>"I don't want you talking about it," she said turning to walk him down the stairs and they made a right turn and she looked at him in surprise as they drove.</p> <p>He reached over and grabbed her hand as they walked along and led her to a secluded spot beside a small tree. He lifted her in his arms and lowered her back to the ground.</p> <p>"I don't want to ruin our friendship," she said looking at him and staring up into his green eyes again as she felt his warm breath on her skin.</p> <p>"Okay then."</p> <p>He kissed her again as he lowered his head and nipped her ear. He moved lower and licked it then licked the side of her neck.</p> <p>"Ooh! Kiss me again" she breathed feeling slightly dizzy.</p> <p>"I don't think it's a good idea at this point. This is too fast for us to talk right now. Why we have to do this is beyond my understanding. I think we should just say the word and forget."</p> <p>"What do you want my advice?"</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me to talk this through with you?"</p> <p>"This will be one over quick. You have to tell me the truth or I'll break your heart and I won't live any longer."</p> <p>"Okay. Now just tell me what to do."</p> <p>"Okay. Lay down on the dirt."</p> <p>She turned and laid down on the grass and he slowly dropped to his knees. He kissed her pussy with his lips before he parted her pussy lips opening her to her innermost secrets. He lowered his head and began licking slowly up along her slit. Using his index fingers he spread her clit hood and began licking her clitty. She loved to feel his tongue on her and to watch him as he ate her. He licked and sucked and then he began moving his tongue up and down on her tiny nub. She began moaning as she felt his finger enter her hole and work their way in. His tongue worked her clit while he fingered her. He then moved it in and out while licking her. She felt him reach his hand around her chest and then he grabbed her breast.</p> <p>"Oooh, you're sexy. I'm going to fuck you now."</p> <p>"Oh don't stop, but I'm ready now."</p> <p>He took it out and she felt a dildo entering her pussy. She was wet. He moved the dildo all the way to the hilt and began thrusting it quickly. "Ooh, you feel so good."</p> <p>"This is so fucking sexy."</p> <p>She felt his mouth covering her clit and she could feel the fake cock inside her pussy.</p> <p>"Ohhhhâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
