It's just...I mean, I don't know."</p> <p>"Well, I know you do," she cooed.</p> <p>"Really?" He blinked. "Really?"</p> <p>"Really now," Mom murmured, her cheeks still colored deep blue. She stood up and turned around, offering her backside up to him. "I'm sorry I asked you this. But, you've really been very helpful."</p> <p>"Thank you," he said in a softer tone. He cupped Mom's ass cheeks in his hands and pulled her toward him.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she sighed, her hips turning seductively as he bent his knees forward. "That feels really good."</p> <p>"I have," he murmured. He kissed the soft flesh of her back, slowly letting his hands rub and caress. Mom let out a soft purr.</p> <p>"I want you," she whispered. "To feel your dick against me again."</p> <p>"Mom, you're getting a lap dance for your birthday."</p> <p>"Naughty boy," she said playfully. She gave him a playful look. "Can't blame you for thinking you can get us away with it."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure."</p> <p>"Now, I have to get back to my work." Mom stepped out of the kitchen and headed toward the stairs, not looking back. She paused and turned around. "See you around, Dad."</p> <p>"You go," he said lightly. "And remember to call me later."</p> <p># # # Mom 2 *</p> <p>Dinner was a quiet meal of pork chops and potatoes and vegetables, with lots of garlic butter. Dad sat back on the couch with a glass of red wine, enjoying the dinner. He looked at Mom, his mind reeling. "Are you okay, Mom?"</p> <p>She looked up and saw her son and kissed him. "Why, sweetie. You got the wrong girl," she said, grinning.</p> <p>He gave her a hug and turned to the side, pulling his father to him. "So, what can I do? Did you really give me that look?"</p> <p>"Yes, sweetie, you could say that."</p> <p>"But you didn't say that again," he said, reaching to stroke Dad's face. "Did you? Did you? What?" He couldn't explain what happened or what Mom did that time.</p> <p>"Honey, what we did is wrong. What would make it wrong?" Dad asked.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" Mom asked. "You know that. Did mom let you lick her pussy again?"</p> <p>"No, Dad, I didn't get you to lick her again. I just got you the idea that she was licking your wife at the same time and that was a really awesome idea."</p> <p>"But, Dad, that still doesn't give you the right to do that. She's pretty and a MILF like your wife, not to mention..."</p> <p>"Just tell me what you think," Dad insisted.</p> <p>Mom shrugged. "Well, it was just another day, after all," she said.</p> <p>"What day?"</p> <p>"It's a Monday. And you know, today was a date, so..." she trailed off. "I have got a date with Mom today, so..."</p> <p>"Okay," Dad said, smiling. "I'll tell you what. Let's call it off."</p> <p>"You don't have a date?"</p> <p>"No, Dad. I didn't want to say anything to the opposite sex."</p> <p>"Mom, you can't go around calling all the girls names."</p> <p>"Mom, seriously, I think this is a lot different than what I was planning to say to you."</p> <p>"It's different! I want to talk to you like a friend or as your mom."</p> <p>"You think you might have to tell me, Mom?" Dad said, his brow knitting together.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, honey. I just think we should take it slow."</p> <p>"I don't want you to take things slow, Mom. I just want to talk about it. We've been talking for two weeks."</p> <p>Mom blushed. Of course, she had known her son was gay, but she had been having a hard time getting out from under his false hopes. "Why don't you take me out to my place for the night? You want to hang out with your friends?"</p> <p>"Okay, Mom. I'm out with my friends. But, it's a date."</p> <p>"But, I want us to meet your Mom, sweetie."</p> <p>"Okay, Mom."</p> <p># # # Mom 2 *</p> <p>"Okay, now let's go."</p> <p>Curtis made his way down to the basementâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
