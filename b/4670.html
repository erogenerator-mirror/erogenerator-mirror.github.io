"What would help, help?" she asked, though in that moment, Miley knew it was what that man was saying.</p> <p>The man's laugh came out as a long, throaty chuckle. "The girl you've been looking at is one of your best friends," he said, gesturing for the girl to come closer.</p> <p>"Hello. I'm sorry to scare you," the girl said, though her eyes were downcast, a nervous expression on her face. "I'm Riley."</p> <p>Miley's mouth opened in shock. There he'd said it. "Uh...Hi Riley," she said, looking up at him. She didn't know if it was that instant recognition or just the way the man said this name—his eyes... he was staring right into her eyes. "I'm...I'm Miley."</p> <p>Miley's hands shot to her hips, trying to cover her body. "Miley, this is Mandy. Mandy, this is Miley," the man said, gesturing to both of them and smiling. Miley blushed at the thought of standing naked in a room full of men, but instead of stopping her, she stood there, staring at Mandy. "So, Miley, what brings you to our country of America?"</p> <p>Miley was blushing deeply enough that her cheeks were turning rosy, and her face looked flushed, as if it was on fire. She shook her head, looking down shyly. "I'm going to college, right? Why would I be so close to a student?"</p> <p>"Uh... I mean, I know a lot about that. But you're not a student yet, right? That's... I guess that the best way to do it is to be a student yourself," the man said. Miley was shocked, and for a moment—maybe she just needed someone that'd know what to do, especially with one who'd already been with many of her boyfriends—as if her words just weren't meant to be. Then another voice inside her told her that words never meant that they did because they weren't meant to be said.</p> <p>"What is your name anyway?" Miley asked.</p> <p>Riley smiled, looking down. "What is it?" he repeated.</p> <p>"Miley. And this is Riley," she answered. She took his hand and drew him closer to her; they were about to kiss.</p> <p>"Miley," Riley said, leaning close to her, his lips pressing to hers and hers opening to receive his tongue.</p> <p>Miley moaned and took his head in her hands, pulling him tighter to her as the sensation of feeling his lips on hers sent a wave of desire through her; she knew she shouldn't have done that but it felt so good. Her mouth remained pressed to his while his mouth followed hers as if a magnet was pulling them towards each other, and her mind was spinning with desire. She didn't expect anything in that moment, but what she got was the perfect reaction. She was not only attracted to him, she wanted him to be her first, and she just loved it. She moaned in his mouth, feeling him respond as he pulled away a little, sucking her lower lip lightly before he did so again, before pulling her closer and running his tongue over her lips. Miley moaned, feeling his lips against hers and tasting the sweetness of her saliva.</p> <p>They continued to kiss slowly and softly, Miley still feeling his hands exploring her body as she felt him slide his hands down her back and around her front. Before she knew it, her shirt had been discarded and her panties were down and out of sight, and now he was holding her up in his arms, his lips crushing hers, his erection pressing against her pussy as their bodies shifted on the bed. Miley was still feeling his lips on hers, and she was a little jealous, but she was also excited, as if that attraction had been strong enough not to be felt, and she was sure that if they had just let things go a little further, it would have been over.</p> <p>Miley felt how she felt, wanting this man. Even now, as she thought about her friends in the club while she lay naked, she found it hard to believe that she actually wanted to sleep with someone she had only met once before. The fact that she was so excited about fucking him, and the fact that she was a virgin made it seem like an appropriate time for them to be dating. After all, Miley knew that she deserved to have that experience, even if it wasn't with someone she'd already known. She felt like that would make her even more desirable if she really—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
