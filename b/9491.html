She looked nothing but sexy and in every respect. Although her eyes were a very dark liquid chocolate, her lips were a thin light pink color that contrasted beautifully with her light brown skin tone. She had bright, shiny bangs covering the bridge of her nose, almost covering her entire face. She had long black hair that fell over her shoulders with two bangs coming down to her middle. She always wore it very high over her large, brown eyes. She wore a pair of tight, low-cut black shirt over a white tank top that had a few patches of fabric showing.</p> <p>She was so pretty. In his opinion. He had thought so many times that she was probably the most beautiful woman on the man.</p> <p>But there she was, he realized as, with her hair in her hands, she wasn't even looking at him. He was looking at the sexy, voluptuous female lying here on his bed. His breath was still coming out in a short gasp and it didn't occur to him that he could be watching his best friend fucking his girlfriend.</p> <p>"You want to fuck me?" she asked, suddenly, suddenly.</p> <p>He nodded and then looked towards the door, "I don't know why you're asking."</p> <p>"Maybe I just do," he answered, a bit hesitantly and for the love of him. He tried to keep looking her without looking at the ceiling...</p> <p>"Oh," She said, and then she smiled, "I know what you said you wanted to do." She leaned towards him and put her hands on her hips and a moment later, she was standing up on her elbow with only the top of her shirt exposed. "Just follow me, honey," she said as she looked over him and they stared into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"But...I mean, I don't know..." he stuttered, his cheeks blushing bright red... "... I mean...I don't wanna rush this... you know..." He stammered as he followed her up the steps to his bed room.</p> <p>But, her soft, gentle voice again broke his trance.</p> <p>"'Cause I want to see you, just like last night." She said with a little smile.</p> <p>His face burned as he felt her hands reaching to his face and brushing his bangs back from his eyes. He couldn't look back. He couldn't move. His body was still throbbing with emotion and his mind was still not entirely clear. What was he thinking? But, he was still hard and there were dark clouds behind his eyes as he followed her to the bed. He just stood there. He couldn't move as she got on the far side of his bed from the bottom to the top and then, he was looking straight down as he followed her eyes. He couldn't tell what color her eyes were... or even what they were. He just stood there and watched her.</p> <p>She smiled as she smiled and then she leaned forward, "Please, don't hold back," She said in a very soft, husky voice.</p> <p>He couldn't do it. He couldn't break away. With the only way he knew to do that, was to touch her...he couldn't. He didn't want to break away and he didn't want her to stop.</p> <p>She leaned in close to him and she placed her large, beautiful white hand on the small of his back. "Tell me how you want to feel me," She said as she pressed her soft lips against his and then they kissed. His lips parted and their lips met. They kissed like they were meant to be and then their lips parted slightly and hers met his. His lips felt so smooth and hot in her mouth. Her tongue brushed his lips lightly. Then, with a soft whimper, he opened his mouth and she tasted herself on his breath. She sucked harder, trying to pull his tongue into his mouth. As her tongue moved against his, his mouth opened further. His tongue slipped into her mouth in response. When he was completely inside of her mouth, his body trembled, and he felt even more excited than he felt before. Her hands caressed his face and he felt a tear slide down his cheek. When he opened his eyes, he saw a glimmer of love shining on her lips and she pressed deeper onto it. He suddenly had the urge to kiss her again...</p> <p>The thought of kissing a girl before his head was in a spin made his erection so hard it hurt. He could no longer feel the girl underneath him. He looked back to her. She smiled as she pulled away from him a bit and then she leaned over and kissed his neck. He closed his eyes and he held back his moan of pain as the pleasure overwhelmed him. His back arched and he moaned as she kissed that spot on his neck that madeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
