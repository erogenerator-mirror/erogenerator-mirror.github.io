"And now I'm looking forward to seeing you...I can't wait for you! I'm all sweaty," and he pulled himself over to her, taking one last, lingering look at her nudity. He smiled when she shrugged and turned her back to him, leaning back on the bed as he slid behind her. Her breasts jiggled at first contact, but he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her to him again, letting his lips graze her skin.</p> <p>"Hm, I don't think these jeans fit me in that way." His hands stroked all over her back, and he pulled her to his body. She couldn't help but lean in and kiss him for the first time. Her mouth opened to his taste, tongue licking along its length, as his hands moved over her back, sliding down to her ass. His palms found their way to her cheeks, and he pulled them down to meet the backs of his hands. He didn't want to waste any of what little she had left in his eyes, but she didn't seem to mind. She parted her legs, and he lifted her up to lie over him. She groaned as his cock slid into her tight pussy, both of them moaning. She turned her face to glance at him, and caught the look he was giving her with a smirk. The desire made her smile, and she took his hand and placed it on her lips. "Mmm, I want to."</p> <p>He moved his hips over hers to grind her, and she groaned again, pressing her hips with his. She was wet, but he wasn't having much success. She rolled onto her back, and he knelt next to her, leaning against the headboard and looking at her. "Do you still feel weird about all this?" His lips grazed hers, and when she didn't respond, he grinned, rolling over to face her.</p> <p>"Don't care," she whispered. His hand cupped her breast, and she pushed back against his fingers, which rubbed and stroked on her while his tongue flicked against her ear and throat. His hand left her breast, and he looked down to see it in his hand, and he moved further down, taking another nipple in between his lips and sucking gently. She gave a tiny gasp, and he smiled back at her, biting gently.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked, pressing his knee between her legs and between them, holding them apart while he pressed down on her with his thigh. "You're still very wet."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," she replied, and he grinned as he looked at her wet lips between them, her pink and swollen clit, shining and pink, swollen and engorged, waiting for his attention.</p> <p>"I think I need a taste..." he murmured, leaning closer, his tongue probing the opening of her pussy. She moaned again, and pushed her hips forward in response. His thumbs brushed against her clit briefly, then slipped between her lips. He used his hand to spread them wider, and used his thumbs to trace back and forth along both sides of her clit with his tongue, pushing her toward a shuddering orgasm as he sucked gently on her breast, letting her feel a little pleasure rush through her.</p> <p>"Oh, God..." she breathed, and he took his chance, licking around her clit from side to side, then back to the tip of her pussy with the flat of his tongue and teeth. He heard her groan, and sucked and teased the lips between his teeth, pushing her closer to the edge. She thrust into his tongue, and he held back to press deeper where her pleasure began to overtake her. He moved in closer, rubbing his face on her inner thigh, and licking her faster now, feeling her fingers flex on his head and pushing his way through her. He could see her legs tightening as she came, and he didn't let up. One hand on her hip, the second on her breast, squeezing as she twitched, and he pushed his finger inside her as she shivered and moaned and writhed in orgasm for him.</p> <p>He lifted himself up to look at her. His eyes were wild with pleasure, and she met his gaze through her glazed eyes...and he smiled, and slid over her body, kneeling over her, pressing one hand between her legs and moving in closer. She looked up at him and ran her fingers through his hair, tugging at him gently, urging him to stay on her. He leaned in, and his tongue flicked across her nipples, and she groaned, her hips thrust upwards.</p> <p>"I can't wait any longer," he murmured in her ear, and her mouth opened to him, her juices glistening on his lips. He stroked her breasts, and she tipped her headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
