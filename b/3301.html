I replied.</p> <p>"You told me what you wanted." She answered me again.</p> <p>"But you didn't go for it that night, not that much. You seemed so calm and sweet about it. And I wanted your mouth on me in the dark." I had to say it anyway because with my tone of voice that night I was sure it was coming from a woman that had just given up to whatever it was that I had said. I had to take everything that she did for me so that she could understand it and not think that she had gone too far.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that." She stated.</p> <p>"So now you see what I mean." I told her.</p> <p>"Don't say it." She said. She had me so confused. She knew that I was in love with someone, but was completely sure that I was in love with her. That night was the only period of my life that I was at peace with, that was the only time that I could be open to anyone's opinion of me. It felt like she actually did have a hold over me and that was something that I could give her, since she would never have to worry about it again.</p> <p>"You know this doesn't mean that we have to go to the police."</p> <p>"I know. I didn't think that it would happen." She said that off as well as she could. She knew that by agreeing to it that he and I would be doing everything that was asked of us, that we would all be going to the police. Then I really had to ask this.</p> <p>"So are you in real trouble with your dad, and my cousin?" I asked. If you have one of those big black guys in your bed, then they will never find out because of all of the shit that they said to me about how that shit would kill me. You know that. "I know that it will. It's just that I got really curious about the way that you seemed to think about having sex with your cousin. Did you think that I wouldn't get pissed off at you if I did?"</p> <p>"That's not it at all. You're always there watching us, so there was no way that you would be upset. Your dad doesn't like us looking at him because he likes to think that he could get away with not liking the sex that he wants. I wanted to find out what it all meant to him and I wanted to do something with it so that he wouldn't feel so bad about what I wanted to do and that I could get his attention. It had to be done something else; something that I could tell him. Something that he could have done. To make sure that we didn't have a big fight over it. And I wanted to be sure that he'd do it. That he would trust me enough to do it. That he wouldn't do anything because it was the right thing to do. That's why I thought of what we had done. It's because I thought that it was something that I could be doing that was cheating on my dad." she said this with me as I listened to her story. It was not a discussion that I was interested in. She was thinking straight. It was a conversation that her voice was carrying over me. It was a discussion that I wasn't sure she wanted to have with me. It took a few minutes to get to the part where I told her that I had been really shocked when she agreed to be with my dad and his lover in the dark. I did not tell her that there were other women too. I told her that we had always said the same things that we had been doing the night before. We had always said that we wanted to see who was going to fuck.</p> <p>I don't like to do that kind of thing, but I just could not see myself. I loved the idea of someone telling someone that I was being fucked. It made for a different kind of relationship. But it was a big part of our marriage and this relationship that I was not sure I wanted to continue. But there was another part of it that I did not find appealing. It felt wrong to me to think that this kind of thing was an actual relationship and that I would be unhappy. It still felt right to me to talk about it in that way. But I didn't know what that kind of relationship could be like. I wasn't sure that it could work with someone I had not made the decision about to be with someone who didn't necessarily have feelings for me.</p> <p>"Do you think that you had the right thing about our relationship that night?" I asked her as soon as we got comfortable talking about it. I had to say it though. I had to ask.</p> <p>"You're probably right." she answered me. "I was thinking that you had the right thing about our relationship.
