You look like you need help, you're covered!"</p> <p>"Yes, thanks, I'll be right back."</p> <p>The whole day passed and the conversation turned to other things than the fact that Mary never really had a boyfriend.</p> <p>"So, where are all the girls off campus and what are they saying?"</p> <p>"The girls are talking about all kinds of interesting things."</p> <p>"Anything in particular you're interested in while we're here?"</p> <p>"Oh, I have a few ideas that just pop up and I was thinking about getting you a couple of beers, I'm going to put the table back inside the corner and if you think of anything that would get you more than a few glasses of wine."</p> <p>"Well don't worry, just the beers might be good, I just want to keep it nice for you," the bartender replied.</p> <p>"Oh that's nice of you to say, I'll get the girls beers too right away," Mary replied before opening her purse to get some water.</p> <p>"So, you like to have a little fun at home?"</p> <p>"It's a beautiful day and a lovely evening, thank you."</p> <p>"I've got a date with a special man and he's really very nice," Mary said over her shoulder as she walked out. "Well, I hope he'll be as good in bed as in a real man, but I gotta wait until later tonight to meet him so we can get to know each other better before then."</p> <p>Mary found herself smiling at how forward and nice the bartender had her. But she couldn't help but smile a little herself at this. She thought to herself, "How am I supposed to go about meeting one of those guys in person for a good night of fun?"</p> <p>When Mary saw her walking through into the food court she thought to herself as she looked at the food and drink choices on the table, "Oh, wait, what's a 'special' night' what does it mean?"</p> <p>The food and drink selections for her, the conversation, and the food choices was flowing nicely.</p> <p>'Hmmm.' she thought to herself, 'It really does start with a quick little meal and drinks to get me more and more drunk, you know?'</p> <p>"Oh, I'm definitely getting more than just drinks," the bartender answered before leaving the line.</p> <p>The more she enjoyed chatting with the bartender she noticed again the bulge in her khaki shorts as she walked.</p> <p>"Just go easy on me, I'm having too much fun and I'll see you later," she said to herself as she smiled and walked out the door.</p> <p>'Oh, well, if it helps the company feel in the good graces of your date, then that's what I'll do.' She thought as she walked to her car and started it up.</p> <p>When Mary started the car she felt really turned on and the thought of just one guy in her life that she could talk to and even go out with, gave her a rush.</p> <p>As she drove back to her apartment she decided to make a date with Dave on the phone, after all, she knew that it was probably time to take things a bit farther.</p> <p>She called Dave and told him that she needed a new place to stay and that was her number she wanted to call him. This was her night and she had to tell him about it.</p> <p>"Great," he answered immediately. "I'll be there in a little bit, just don't be too long if that is what you want."</p> <p>Mary left her apartment and got herself another beer while trying not to notice the bulge in her khaki shorts, that were starting to show. It's just, my heart is still racing and I'm so horny, she thought to herself.</p> <p>Mary walked back into her apartment and opened the door and noticed that the lights were on. She had a thought as she headed towards the bathroom which was on the other side of the apartment. She looked at her phone and saw that the text conversation had been short and sweet.</p> <p>'Hey, I was hoping you had come over to meet with me, I was just headed to dinner and drinks and nothing at the moment. Will meet up in 20.00'</p> <p>She could always put her bag in her car and get another drink if the place was busy and if it was a little early.</p> <p>She finished her beer and was starting to get a bit thirsty as she headed towards the bathroom. As she walked in the door she saw her purse sitting open by the door and she saw her keys laying on the counter.</p> <p>"Oh, uh, what's this?" Mary said as she opened the door to her bedroom.</p> <p>Mary walked in and noticed that as she walked up it felt as if her breasts were in an entirely differentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
