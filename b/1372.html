Now I could move it in and out very easily for about five or so seconds before it was fully erect again.</p> <p>I then bent down and kissed Amy again on the cheek.</p> <p>"Ooohhhh," she moaned.</p> <p>"Just so you don't fall asleep at night," I offered to Amy.</p> <p>"Nooo!" She moaned in a very frustrated voice, "I got tired of being asleep! I got tired of being out of my head. I had gotten it again! I got tired of being so frustrated in my house! I had got the frustration of being alone!"</p> <p>"It's OK," I comforted her, "You're going to have a great night! There's a lot to be done today."</p> <p>"No....I don't want you to make me wait!" She pleaded.</p> <p>"OK, we'll see," I assured her, and then gave her hand a squeeze.</p> <p>"Ooohhhhhh," she moaned again, "Can't wait...."</p> <p>"Let me take care of the dishes," I offered. I was already getting the dishes out of the kitchen cabinet when I felt Amy's hand gently squeeze me again for good measure.</p> <p>"I'm going inside," she told me.</p> <p>"No," I assured her, "I'm not going anywhere. Come on inside the living room. We'll finish the dishes right after we've finished having sex."</p> <p>"OK.....OK," she agreed happily.</p> <p>I went back into the living room and picked up the laundry. I'd washed the bedspread last night and was hoping to wash the bedspread on Saturday night with it. I was going to go in and pick up the towels for Amy when her boyfriend went to bed. However, when Amy came into the house the other night, I had just got myself undressed.</p> <p>"I guess somebody gave the washcloth to you," she said as she wrapped it around herself.</p> <p>"Yep....I thought so," I answered.</p> <p>"You know....the washcloth is nice and clean," Amy replied.</p> <p>"How did you know that?" I offered to tell her.</p> <p>"I'd been over there for a while once in a while. He didn't show up when I was on the computer," Amy explained.</p> <p>"I don't think he showed, but there's something else," she said curiously.</p> <p>"Maybe," I responded, wondering if Amy was going to call him, now that she knew that he was a jerk, to try and get some kind of sexual stimulation for her. So I just looked at her wondering what she was talking about.</p> <p>"Amy, I hope this really doesn't hurt," I whispered to her.</p> <p>"I don't want to stop being in your situation; I want to be able to do the same for you" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.</p> <p>"Don't you ever get used to this anymore?" I asked her.</p> <p>"No...I mean...this is a new experience for me too," she hesitantly added.</p> <p>"But you still can't sleep when you're at home!" I explained to her.</p> <p>"I know that!" She replied softly.</p> <p>"Can you get use to having it done to you every night?" I asked her, trying to soften her feelings a bit.</p> <p>"Mmmmm....I like it," she replied.</p> <p>"Yes," I agreed as she sat down on the couch, "But now you have a choice."</p> <p>"You've been telling me that story all of the time," she informed me.</p> <p>"No kidding..." I answered.</p> <p>"Don't get all shy! You can be all your life and just tell me so what's it like when I tell you, don't you just want to hear it from me?" She replied.</p> <p>"Yeah, but you can't really tell me...I'm not interested in what you're going to do...."</p> <p>"Why not?" she asked me softly, "Just take a chance with me."</p> <p>"Don't you have enough confidence in you just to think that way?" I asked her.</p> <p>"There's no doubt that I'm pretty confident in my lovemaking with you," Amy replied.</p> <p>"Well then," I said, "Then I guess that we'll just have to be sure to always listen to each other."</p> <p>"Let's get to that," she said, and she got up and took my hand and pulled me down on the couchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
