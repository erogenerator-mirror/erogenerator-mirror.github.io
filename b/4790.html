You're not the one with a name," she said wryly. "Or maybe that's my nickname. I never had a real nickname for you, but sometimes I do," I grinned, thinking to myself how good someone could be a person too."</p> <p>She laughed.

I asked innocently.</p> <p>She had a funny expression on her face for a moment.</p> <p>"We should go home and get some dinner," she said, with a big smile.

They were all looking so well, and it was probably the reason I was looking at them instead of my own home town. What I had done in New Hampshire in these past few years had seemed like a lifetime ago, but it seemed so much more since then. After walking through a lot, and it was still mid-afternoon when I walked back in my front door, I pulled into a driveway at a small lakefront town and pulled over.</p> <p>They were in the back seat, my mother sitting close to me and looking like she was reading my thoughts.</p> <p>"Who is she?" my mother asked, "Why does your brother have to die in this house?"</p> <p>I stared at her for a moment, my jaw dropping as I thought about how she must feel to be dying at the hands of her oldest son's boyfriend, a man whom she thought herself to be her best friend. I had watched my grandfather when he was young, and for all my family, she had always told me that I could do it with her. It had always been her belief that being in her early 40's would cause any kind of harm to my parents. As I drove my mind back to her father she had mentioned, "I'm sure my brother always had a thing for Elizabeth!"</p> <p>My grandfather had never told her about that incident. For that matter, he didn't say she was beautiful, and I knew I probably did. Still, after the first time he mentioned her name, she had never mentioned to me her being the only one in his life to be in his life. She would sometimes give him a quick once a week update on the times he got off if he knew something was going on. My mother knew all this, and now as I sat there I started thinking about why she was so interested in him? She didn't really know it. She was too much younger than him, almost twenty. He was old enough to be her first child, and he was probably the only father to her. And besides, she didn't really want him to know who he was. Not just yet, anyway.</p> <p>I drove up into the water and was surprised to see how quiet the property was. I thought she probably was just using the car for a reason instead of doing it herself. She had been out of the house for a considerable amount of time. I remembered the first time she had used the property. The first time she had just bought the house. She hadn't been doing anything about it for some reason. Now she was moving out of state.</p> <p>I looked around and saw no one, except for myself and her mother in the first story windows. I got out of the car and walked over to her, taking her in my arms.</p> <p>"Elizabeth, what's wrong? Why are you in these homes? Are you not doing anything wrong?"</p> <p>She looked up at me, tears starting to stream down her cheeks and at the corners of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
