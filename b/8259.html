She led me to the water. I could feel my stomach clenching as my blood raced back into my body.</p> <p>Her head was swimming with excitement. She was not going easy on me, either. I was trying my best to resist it, though. She could tell I was about to come and I had to fight back.</p> <p>"No. No, no, no." I said in defiance. She pulled me forward by the hand. I couldn't resist, I gave in. I grabbed the back of her neck, but I pulled myself back onto her lap.</p> <p>"You are the sweetest guy." She said smiling. "Thanks." She let go of me as I fell back.</p> <p>I felt cold liquid running down my stomach and she pulled herself up to wrap her arms around me. I wrapped my arms around her, holding her against me.</p> <p>"Let's get out of here." I whispered.</p> <p>She turned my face toward her and kissed me. I could feel her arms and legs trembling under me. "You are so sweet." She whispered as she kissed down to my neck. I wanted to stay with her, but I had no where to go.</p> <p>I ran my hand down her back, my fingers brushing against the thin straps of her dress. I felt her muscles ripple with it.</p> <p>"No, you can't come on me." She said softly. "And I won't be able to stop you." She leaned down, taking hold of me under my shirt, which was still bunched up on my stomach. I could feel her breath on my stomach, and it made me tingle.</p> <p>I wanted to protest, but she pushed her lips into me, sucking on my collar bone. My body arched against her as I pressed back against her. She pulled back, her fingers reaching up, massaging my skin, pulling me toward her. I knew if I stayed there, I would come, and I knew her body was responding to this motion.</p> <p>Her eyes were looking up at me as she continued touching me. I could feel them caressing my skin, like silk against the heat of her body. My face was red, covered with moisture, as her lips grazed over it. Her gaze met mine as they explored between my eyes and her lips. When I pulled away, she smiled broadly.</p> <p>"I'm sure you'll feel better under the water after we're in the bathroom." She said. "Now, let's get out."</p> <p>She pulled me off the back of the Jacuzzi and turned around. She ran her hand down my chest and stomach, lingering below my navel. She stopped when she reached my briefs.</p> <p>"No. No. You have to be careful with these."</p> <p>She pushed my shirt up, freeing my hard on. I looked down and saw how long and thick it was, and I felt my cock twitch as she touched it.</p> <p>"Oh, you like that, don't you?" She laughed.</p> <p>"Yes." I said, pushing forward against her. She pulled away, smiling again. She ran a finger along the bottom of the length of it.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes." I repeated.</p> <p>I stood up and stepped up behind her, pressing my cock against her. She smiled a little wider, taking my hand and pushing it into her pants. I felt around for a moment, looking as if I expected to see the head of my cock.</p> <p>"My clit... Oh!" She gasped as she felt it harden as I touched her. It made me shiver. She pulled my hand into her pants, pressing her hips up against me as I rubbed. She was wet, and I could feel her arousal against my finger.</p> <p>"I'd like to finish your gift," She said.</p> <p>"I know," I said, sliding my hand upwards. She pulled aside the side of her pants, and I could feel the smooth skin of a soft, round ass as her pants pulled up and her feet touched the bottom step of the steps.</p> <p>"Good boy." She said. "You can finish the rest... just stand here with your hands above your head." She ran her fingers through her hair, making it all the more so.</p> <p>I nodded, and she pushed me down onto the flooring of the Jacuzzi. She knelt down over me, lowering her lips to my cock. I held my breath, expecting her to suck on it. I had to be content with just feeling the water running down my spine, knowing that I would come before she did.</p> <p>"Good boy. Good boy." She purred. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
