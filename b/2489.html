How's he doing?"</p> <p>"Oh, he just got back from the doctor, they're having surgery in the afternoon for his heart."</p> <p>"It's going off really fast."</p> <p>"Well that should be no problem. Why don't you let him up for a while and let them get him some sleep so you can get his doctor's orders if they want. He has a lot of catching up to do."</p> <p>"Don't you have work to do?"</p> <p>"Yes, but I do have a couple of things to do."</p> <p>He started toward the door, but I said, "If they don't want him back here, there's no excuse for you not to come." He looked at me. "I think you just said enough words, so I'll leave you alone. If you want to stay and talk, that's up to you."</p> <p>He nodded and closed the door. I headed for the showers. When I was in, I noticed that a nice-sized shower would be good. I could wash a good six or seven hours a day. Maybe he could take that to a spa and get me some time off. I grabbed a towel and walked into the bathroom. He didn't say a word and I knew he didn't like being seen talking with me. We rinsed ourselves off and hung our towels on the shower rail. I put my arm around his back and he gave me a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"Good night, Johnathan. And, thank goodness for the soap. It's not that sensitive."</p> <p>"It feels good so far. If that's anything like having a cold shower to go with it, I'd still go."</p> <p>We climbed out of the shower and dried off. We dried quickly. When he came back out, I dropped the towel and grabbed him again. He turned and looked at me while we kissed.</p> <p>"You can finish cleaning up if you want to," I said. He looked at me, and slowly licked his lips. After a long kiss, I turned and started up the stairs to my bedroom. When my door closed, I turned to him. He looked at me again and gave me a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"Do you want to continue? Or, you want to do it another way?"</p> <p>"You can do the same."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, and followed him into the bedroom. We got on the bed and I pushed him down on his back. I began to kiss and lick his neck and face. This was great! When I moved down to his belly button, I realized that he had always thought I was fat, so I pulled it roughly open. I licked the length of his cock and then took his balls into my mouth. He had already come so many times that I could have done it for another time.</p> <p>"Suck on my cock," he said.</p> <p>I didn't hesitate, but I kissed him on the lips and pushed him on his back. I took his cock into my mouth. This guy had just told me that if he came so quickly, it was only going to be like in the shower. I began to suck while I stroked the rest of his cock. I slid my lips up and down. When he was as hard as possible I slid my tongue back up to the tip and moved my open mouth down again. When I licked the underside of his cock, he began to moan. I had come to respect him, so I let him come in my mouth. He came twice, and it was the best orgasm I ever had.</p> <p>I climbed on him and slid inside. We started fucking and I felt his cock growing hard again. After a long time, we switched positions again. I rolled over as I got my feet under him so he could pound my pussy. While he was pounding me, I reached up and stroked his face and kissed him deeply. We were making out for at least fifteen minutes. When he came, I came with him. His cum shot inside me with my body spasm as he unloaded inside of me. He collapsed on the bed beside me, and I collapsed on my side. We had been making out for over a half hour. He reached out and touched my left breast. I turned to him and we fell asleep with him between my legs.</p> <p>We awoke in the morning, after a half hour of spooning. It took only a little while to get our bodies hard again. He fucked me so hard that I could barely sit. I was so happy to have him back with me. I wanted him to do it the most often. So when I felt his hand between my legs and heard him groaningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
