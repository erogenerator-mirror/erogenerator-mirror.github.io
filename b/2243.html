She couldn't move - her husband was a married man- but she could feel the blood rushing to her face and chest from her arousal, from the tingles running from her belly to the base of her spine, along her inner thighs and across her crotch.</p> <p>Her nipples, so engorged and erect that they poked out from her shirt, were aching and the cool night air seemed to tease them even harder. The only rational part of her rational mind was that it must be wrong; she'd just taken advantage of an eighteen years old girl's vulnerability and let her body do that to herself. But the wetness between her legs wanted to be free, she wanted to come.</p> <p>She didn't seem to be listening to what Frank was saying, but she could hear his breathing as he looked at her and, when she looked at the door to see that it was locked she just couldn't help but wonder what it might be locked about. "What if someone comes in?"</p> <p>Sally shivered a little, her heart beating fast as she fought back the urge to go down and look for the door, when the thought occurred to her. If she would stay like this she might get upset and try to escape, but then she'd be out in the cold with her blouse and her nipples poking out as hard as the tips of her breasts, and, even worse, if the door swung open, she might be caught. And if she tried to run, she would be found.</p> <p>She wanted to come on and run into the bedroom but she found that she needed to sit down for a minute to adjust her bra and her breasts and her skirt.</p> <p>Sally tried to open the door as she began to think of how she was going to explain why she hadn't come and get her panties and bra in and took them upstairs. She was trying to make up a story about not having gone somewhere and how, although there was no one in the bathroom at home and the door wouldn't be closed properly, he had gone to his own study. She'd just forgotten that he had a key to the door and had left it unlocked and that he wasn't here to see her. What would she tell everyone.</p> <p>But, just as she began thinking these things, they began to fade away, the idea of being caught becoming stronger and stronger.</p> <p>As the minutes passed Sally's mind began to wander once more to how she'd left her panties and bra on the desk in the bathroom, to wondering if she might be discovered. That the wetness between her legs was still seeping from between them, even though it seemed that she wasn't at all the only one doing stuff. The fact that there were now signs of her arousal on her leg, even though she was so turned on as her nipples poked out, was turning her on so much it was driving her crazy. She'd come three times in only a few minutes, her knees getting weak, her hands trembling, and her panties so painfully wet that even if she had moved, she wondered if she could keep the panties where she'd fallen, from the top of the dresser to the bottom of the closet.</p> <p>As they walked into the living room Sally was struck at how much she liked that room. The furniture wasn't too bad - there was an old-fashioned sofa, easy chair and a couple of couches in the living room, but they all matched the furniture. And all of the furniture in that room fit the room and the wall. The table in the living room, for example, stood out like a picture in the corner, and even across from that it stood a large red and black double-engraved photograph.</p> <p>Just outside the door on the other side of the room, Sally couldn't help but see the photograph. It was a photo of Sally, standing in front of the photograph, her head thrown back, her hair draped across her shoulders and her hands wrapped around the base of the photograph. Her face was turned away from the photo, her head turned to the right, the right corner of one eye moving slightly back and forth in time with her fingers. And the image was of her lying on the floor. The picture was just the right size and colour. Sally could just see what the photograph was: her naked body leaning back on the floor, her eyes cast down, her mouth slightly open, her full lips slightly parted. Her mouth was slightly parted, her lips forming a perfect circle which was obviously caused by her breath coming in short little gasps.</p> <p>As Sally glanced to her right to get a better view Sally noticed that the picture hadn't changedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
