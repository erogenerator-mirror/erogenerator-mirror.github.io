We didn't get to do anything." He stood up, pulling his swimsuit bottoms down, and throwing them in the sink. "There." He said. I stepped out of my swimsuit and stood there nude, looking up at him.</p> <p>"Wow. So now what?" I asked. "Well, I guess I have a better idea," he said and bent over in front of my chair and pulled his suit down so the back of it was covering more of his ass. It was one of his tightest trunks I had ever seen. "Yeah." He said as he stood up, turning around and looking at me.</p> <p>"Ok. Thanks. It's no problem." I said to as best as I could.</p> <p>"Nite," he said and walked off to his bedroom to get an erection. I stayed there naked while he turned out the lights in his room and sat down on the bed waiting for me to join him. I stood there for a few minutes, thinking about the night before. I had not done anything with anybody else, but now I knew I definitely wanted to do it. We had been in the pool, and his fingers had been all over me. I don't know why, but I felt dirty, and wanted it so bad. I had never felt so bad about it before. I just had to have it.</p> <p>I stepped onto the bed, sitting on the edge as I waited for him to get dressed up. "Let's go have some drinks." I said as I grabbed my towel to wrap up for him. As I was starting to wrap it up, the doorbell rang. I looked out, not bothering to cover up, just letting my towel drop to the floor. I opened the door for him, seeing him walking through it naked and smiling as he said, "Wow, that was great. I have wanted to have sex with you for so long." As I opened it, he quickly wrapped it up and let it drop to the floor. "Well. It can wait. No need to rush things," I thought to him as I turned back so he could wrap it up to cover it.</p> <p>We had a nice evening together, and each made love and kissed that night. It was like the first time we had made love together. It became something unique in the way we made each other cum. I knew it would be an incredible time, and I think it has been more exciting than anything we have done before.</p> <p>But a few months ago. My boyfriend of about 2 months was out of town on business for 5 days, and the weekend was going to be just fine. There was something on my mind though. I looked over at him lying in bed in only his swimsuit. "Is something wrong?" I asked as I walked over to him.</p> <p>"Just thinking about what you are going to say to me tonight." He said.</p> <p>"It'll be all right," I said as I kneeled down in front of him. "I can't wait for you to hear it," I told him as I ran my hands down the length of his trunks so they wouldn't come off. He pulled his briefs down and his erect cock came out in full glory. I grabbed it and started to stroke it as I looked at his face. "You want it?" I asked as I stared at his cock.</p> <p>"Yes" was all he could say.</p> <p>"But I want to hear you say that." I said.</p> <p>"Yes. I want to hear you say that." he responded.</p> <p>"Okay." I grabbed his cock again, taking the tip so I could look into his eyes as I stroked it. "I'll have to talk for a little while." I said. "But you have to think about this." And then I stopped. "I'm the one doing the talking. Let's get something to eat, shall we?" I started to get up. "No. Go get some rest. We have a lot of catching up to do. There's a party tonight at the hotel across the street." I said as I got up, taking my bikini top off as I went to the bathroom.</p> <p>I got back and went to the kitchen to get us some juice. We didn't drink any, and while we weren't all that hard I thought we looked good together. And so I made us a couple of breakfast sandwiches that we ate in my room, along with some fruit and some toast and juice. The whole time, we talked about everything and anything. After our sandwiches, we sat around naked in front of each other. And from the look of this look on his face, I didn't want to get him all fired up. We talked about all of the things we had done with each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
