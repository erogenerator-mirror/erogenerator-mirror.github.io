She had heard of the night-cap and thought it was only a little later than usual. She had been so wrapped up with her dream and she had been so out of control, that she had not noticed the woman sitting on the bed outside until she slowly took it away. She then felt her way to the bar and leaned over the bar to start her drink when she glanced at it while she walked to get it.</p> <p>She had been dreaming of one thing happening to her all these years, but never thought she would get an actual chance to dream it. A small part of her was still concerned about why she had even said that last night and was trying to pull the dream from her. She had tried to keep it from happening to someone else and it hadn’t happened, but there just wasn’t a chance in hell. She was so in love with her father and would never leave him.</p> <p>As she walked through the bar door she was surprised to find that someone had gone into the living room. She also heard the door lock and heard voices outside. She thought she had forgotten about the door, but it was open just a little too wide and it didn’t seem like she had been alone on the first night. Her heart pounded in her ears and she wondered if there were people coming out to the bar in the middle of the night.</p> <p>As she took a drink of her tea she noticed a man sitting on a bar stool. A small, white man in his thirties and a young woman with just as short a hair blonde hair. One man was seated with another in the other end of the bar. The girl turned around and saw that the black man was sitting next to a tall good looking man. She wondered what was going on in the dark room. It seemed that the man had been taking money out of a man on the stool behind him a couple of days ago. Her father had given her a hundred dollars to help her move in a new place because her father was getting an extra hundred dollars for some stupid joke. Now that they were being forced in, there was a whole other set of bills coming their way, but she could just walk out now.</p> <p>The man on the stool seemed to just sit there grinning until he thought he could make it no more and he slowly leaned back his head and looked over at her. She almost caught his eye. He had never smiled before and it gave her the creeps. He did look good as he sat there on the stool.</p> <p>She took a slow sip of her tea and wondered why she had even come here. She would never want to be a wife again, never want to live in another person’s house anymore. It sure would be better for her husband to be dead than her living in another person’s house.</p> <p>As she started to walk out the door, she noticed the man on the bar sitting on the stool. They were talking with another man. He must have heard a man’s conversation with the girl right near the doorway. He did that with a look and didn’t move away from where he was leaning on the bar. She wondered what that was all about. She couldn’t quite tell the look or expression on his face.</p> <p></p> <p>When she got down a flight of stairs, they heard the conversation going on behind her and she looked up with a frown. The guy at the end of the bar was talking to the man who had been sitting there. She wondered what was going on and if this man knew what they were talking about. This might have been a good thing or a horrible thing or both, but in her head the only way they could tell she was still alive was if they followed her to get into her room for the night.</p> <p>She shook her head in reply as she entered the bar and the man at the counter spoke briefly. The man looked up and then turned to the girl. They then sat again and the man leaned a bit forward in his stool. Now it was his little hand that was touching the front of her skirt. The thin material on this short man was almost entirely transparent. She just stood there watching his every motion as his hand touched her thigh, then moved up between her legs. His finger started to push into the inside of the leg of the skirt as his thumb gently rubbed her clitoris. She had to bite her lip when her nipple went erect.</p> <p>After a few minutes, he turned back to the bar only to look her over again. She could feel the blood rushing into it in her ears and wondered if he did any longer than they had to and if was still awake. The man at the counter smiled at this and his finger started to rub up and down on her panties. She had closed her eyes and felt the little tingle all over herself that the man—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
