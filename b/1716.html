I'll get dinner, do something," said Jake's sweet voice after hearing the door shut behind her. He went back into his room, grabbed the TV remote and started the game.</p> <p>Jake sat on the couch with his beer, thinking about when he would get to the airport. He could never find a good flight to get to Boston... it was bad luck for the airline and bad luck for all airlines. His plane ride had left him feeling slightly empty and more satisfied than ever. A new job, a new girlfriend and no longer just a flight.</p> <p>What the hell. It might not be a great life but it was getting better in the meantime . . . his new job was good, if he would just get a second job. He could get an interview and still get his life back. Who the hell did he want to get a second job?</p> <p>Jake tossed back the last of his beer and opened the box next to the television. He looked at his watch, it was 7:02 p.m. He sat there for a minute and let the weight of his life settle down and start to calm down. How could this make him feel any better? It's all been his dream and his life and the next day he is supposed to be in a small apartment with a woman. What was he thinking? What if this was what he wanted? He could never tell his ex and he had no right to expect she would want a second marriage. He was already married and a marriage of convenience. What now?</p> <p>Jake turned off the television. He reached over and handed the box to the other man. He set the beer down and stared through the hole in the door at the picture on the wall. He didn't even notice the box had a folded piece of paper inside. How could he keep this from happening? Here he was, out in the middle of nowhere. He closed and sealed the box, then made a hasty exit.</p> <p>Chapter 16</p> <p>Ricky had never had anything of a sexual nature before. He hadn't had sex in years. Usually it was with women but he had a woman friend, that was all. Now, he was stuck in a bad relationship with a woman who had gone through a bad period of losing her husband and the loss of a husband she was always looking to lose after his divorce.</p> <p>She left when he found out she was pregnant and had the baby she was looking for. She never went down on him and left when he found out her husband was cheating on her with another woman. He was so depressed and sad. He had no idea what was going on in his life that day. He had no idea why he would betray his girlfriend's trust by cheating on her. She was his best friend. A woman who he loved and respected. A woman who had to be there for him sometimes. Someone he could help him with as a friend. He had no idea what he was going to do. He had to get his head straight and do something.</p> <p>His mind was going crazy. He felt like he could hear music in his head right now, as if the woman he had loved was talking to him. What was this world coming to?</p> <p>He walked up to a door on the left and took the handle. It was slightly metal except he still saw the key on the inside of the door. He looked into the mirror behind him and then looked back at he self and the strange reflection. He ran his hands through his hair and threw the towel away from him and then went searching in his bedroom. He found a small mirror and saw his reflection staring at him.</p> <p>"Hello," said the stranger voice in his ear.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Jake..."</p> <p>"I'm Ricky, I'm the friend you left... sorry about the break-up of yours." It seemed like the stranger was trying to convince Jake but he couldn't deny it. She was beautiful. He knew he wanted to kiss and touch her but he couldn't do anything about it.</p> <p>"I'm really excited about this trip and what we'll be doing. I don't want to do anything here that you might regret," he said with what he hoped was a sincere smile.</p> <p>"It's ok. You are right it's just... I can't take it. It's just that your friend is there and she's a pretty girl. So, we might as well go." He couldn't believe he said that out loud. It was almost as if she wanted the man to stay in the shadows and tell her about her husband's cheating.</p> <p>"Sounds good," she said putting out her hand to shake the stranger's. He took her hand and they shook several times.</p> <p>"I'll meet you out front," said Ricky giving a quick wave.
