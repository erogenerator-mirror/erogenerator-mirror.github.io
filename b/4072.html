I asked as my lips pulled the skin into place. She nodded as her hand moved away. The room came alive and I could tell we had reached an emotional level.</p> <p>I continued stroking her and she seemed at peace. "Yes, that's fine. Your body is so very different from your boyfriend." She smiled at my analogy and smiled. "I think now that my friend is back it would be okay for us to explore sex together."</p> <p>"What will you do to me?" I asked curiously. I knew that I wanted to go out on a date. After all, when was the last date that I have had, with my parents, and when did I get to have sex with a guy?</p> <p>She leaned back and said, "I'll let you try something different. It might take longer than it's going to, but I have had it once already."</p> <p>"Okay, we'll wait. I don't want you to put the whole party in jeopardy. You can stay here. Maybe we can go to your favorite restaurants to celebrate. What would be a great dinner?"</p> <p>I saw the wheels turning as my mind was spinning with possibilities. "That's great. Let's go to a restaurant and go to bed."</p> <p>She looked at me very warm and very much like she was enjoying the story. I had no idea what to expect.</p> <p>She grabbed my hand and we headed to the car. We went in the back seat, it was quite comfortable. She started the engine and put it in gear.</p> <p>"I want to show you something!" We both got out of the car but not before she unbuttoned my jeans. "You have an amazing body!" She knelt down and ran her tongue lightly up one side of the leg and then slowly down the other. As the fabric opened up I could see my cock start to grow a little. Her eyes were closed and her tongue continued lightly licking the shaft. She took me in her mouth and deep throated as she moved her tongue up and down.</p> <p>She looked up at me with a sexy smile on her face and said, "You like that?" I nodded as her mouth began sucking harder. Her eyes opened wide and she began sucking.</p> <p>"I love it!" she told, "You are so big and big!!" With that she looked up at me and said in a low sexy voice, "Give it to me, please!" as she went back to sucking me in and out.</p> <p>Within a few moments a small orgasm welled up in me and I knew I was about to burst and I could not hold it. I pulled her off and turned her around and I held her and kissed her as I squeezed her breasts. She smiled and reached under herself and fondled my cock and I quickly grabbed my swollen cock with my hand and aimed it at her ass. I put just the head in before pushing down.</p> <p>"Put it in, please!" she begged. She slowly and carefully let me fill her. I did not stop until my entire cock was in and the head was in her ass.</p> <p>"You fill me up so well!" she exclaimed. I reached under her and stroked her pussy as I continued to push into her. I could see her breasts quivering with her efforts and she knew she had no control over that little voice. She stopped and turned around offering her back to me and said, "Put it in!" and I put it back in.</p> <p>She held me close for long moments. Eventually she moved around taking me in her hands and guiding my cock in and out of her so easily. "Ooooooh!" she squealed " That feels so good." I pulled her close and she held me close. Our mouths met again as we kissed, our tongues exploring deeply. We broke momentarily to gasp and then our lips met again. We kissed passionately as the passion intensified. We broke at the last second and stared into each others eyes. Her eyes were clouded over and she looked back at me with what I felt was the most intense expression I'd ever seen.</p> <p>"Ohhhh!!" she said. She looked at me with love and happiness and said hoarsely, "You have nothing to be scared of!" We kissed again.</p> <p>"I know!" I said. I looked at her with her eyes and said, "I'm glad we're on the coast. And I'm not the only one enjoying this."</p> <p>She was staring at me with a look that made me wonder if she was having a tough time of getting it up after watching the video.</p> <p>"I don't feel as good as the last guy I've had." She stopped smiling for a few moments. "Can you stay hard for as long as you need?" She asked.</p> <p>"Sure I can," I said giving her a bigâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
