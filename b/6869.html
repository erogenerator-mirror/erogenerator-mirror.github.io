I said. "We are. It's what everyone wants, right?"</p> <p>The discussion continued throughout breakfast, although this time the discussion seemed to be turning back to our marriage. After that, Susan and I discussed how to set the pace once the wedding was over. She got right behind me and said that she couldn't believe it if we kept going forward with our marriage because it would be better for us if we stayed at least until after the ceremony did the same as she had.</p> <p>"What I have in mind is a better situation. I can't believe how hard we can be."</p> <p>"But, now that we are getting married, everything will be back to normal," I told her. "What about the babies?"</p> <p>"What about the baby? I have to start talking to our baby about the same time we are, because I'm so damn tired. I want to be able to look at him every morning and see him every night."</p> <p>"But, all of this will be done before the wedding. You and I both have to have sex now!" I pleaded. "And, by God, don't try and pretend that we didn't do it before we had to say we were not going to. What more can you ask for?"</p> <p>"Don't worry, honey. Everything will be done before we say our vows. You have a job to complete, you are a good person who lives in a decent home, and you have a wonderful wife who doesn't take advantage of youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
