She was still holding onto my dick, although her grip had shifted up a little. I was feeling very confident in having my body in this state. Even though it was only a few moments at the moment, it felt as though I was going to cum. I was really enjoying this position right now, really enjoying her touch and being touched so many different ways I could not be done. I closed my eyes and I was enjoying how much it added something to the action. It felt good when she held it and I got a nice sensation. She started whispering and I felt her teeth as she bit down. It seemed as if she could taste my dick. I felt her take my hand and put it on her breast again and I was really getting excited. She got on top of me and I felt her pussy press itself against my member. I couldn't do much of anything and my body tensed up. She knew that I was going to cum and she was very careful. When I did, I felt the cum run out of me and into her and onto her body.</p> <p>"Wow," was all I could say. I had thought it would be just a reflex or something and not really thinking about it. It was more like a big load. She lifted herself up and we kissed some more. Her mouth was so sweet and her kiss was as wonderful as ever, I would say. We broke our kiss for a second and I pulled my pants up again. She pulled her shirt back on and I felt a bit odd as if I could have my dick under something, but not see where it was. I looked around. There was no one else around. I was just sitting there like I always had been.</p> <p>"Do you have a key?" I asked, not really sure why.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm free now." She said. It took me a second to think about that and maybe she did also. Her arms came up and she pulled her shirt off and she threw it on the floor and then went to her bag and got her keys. I still wasn't sure how she did it but I could tell she did have a key in it somewhere. She went and sat on the couch and took her clothes off. I did the same. We were still kissing a lot and she was playing around, running her fingers around my face, and eventually going down and opening my shirt. I was naked by now and not even a little bit embarrassed and she was touching my dick. I didn't say a word and just leaned back and enjoyed. She looked up at me and kissed the head slowly with her mouth, licking my juices as if she had done this all her life. There were tears in her eyes and some that looked weird. As she licked them, she closed her eyes and put my head in her mouth. It felt nice and I was happy she liked it. I felt her tongue moving around my shaft and she moved it down and then back up and then back down. She kissed my dick a lot, making little nips and swirling around. I did not have a lot of experience to be with a guy and I was a little worried that she would be upset if she tried to fit it in her mouth.</p> <p>"Oops." I finally said. I was glad she had taken some initiative and that she was giving me the time of my life. She just kept up the licking. Then she stopped.</p> <p>"Oh," she said. "Oops." I was a bit embarrassed. When she licked me right there all day it had really seemed natural and I was in no position to stop her. She kept licking. Her licking got longer and a little bit faster and when I got to where I thought her tongue might touch my dick again, I tried to hold it in. She had stopped. She was going slower and more of the licking was slower and then more and it was as if she was getting all of my dick into her mouth at once. I had no idea what to say. I knew there were people walking by on the street but it sounded wrong to say it. But I had not been able to think of anything else so I didn't say anything. I just let the moment go and I could feel how I felt. I had already come so it felt good.</p> <p>"You still there?" she asked. I looked up.</p> <p>"Yes, but I am close to exploding," I told her.</p> <p>"Let me," she said. I wanted to feel her mouth around my dick again even though this time she had just had the taste from my cock. She sucked, she got up, she went to her bag and opened it. She got back onto her knees and put some lotion on her right hand. She then slid her fingers down the middle of my dick to it. She stroked it slowly, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
