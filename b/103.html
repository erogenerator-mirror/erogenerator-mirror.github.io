She smiled at me and gave a small shake of her head, pushing her hair back out of her face.</p> <p>"I'm doing all right," she said and kissed me hard on the lips.</p> <p>We kissed each other some more and I stroked her cheek and her chest as we kissed as well. There was a bit of a tickling sensation and I had to push her away slightly to control it.</p> <p>"Wow," she mumbled, almost too loudly for me, "You really did!"</p> <p>"Yes," I corrected her, "I really did!"</p> <p>We kissed some more and I held her hands, making a bit of a "come-hither" motion with my fingers as I pressed against her soft belly. She leaned into me and I kissed the nape of her neck as well.</p> <p>"Do you realize that you're still shaking your head?" I asked with my mouth on her right ear, pulling it down to her earlobe. I kissed it gently.</p> <p>"Yes, I do."</p> <p>"That wasn't so bad was it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nope."</p> <p>I kissed to her jaw, and then her neck and her chin.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Well," she replied softly and looked towards my crotch, "I feel like I'm dripping."</p> <p>"Tingle?" I asked, pulling her face up towards me, "Are you cold?"</p> <p>She shook her head. "Nope."</p> <p>"Are you naked?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Are you wet?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Are you wet?" I repeated, looking at her closely, "Are you dripping?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I reached down between her legs and began to pull her panties aside and slip a finger inside her.</p> <p>"Are you wet, Baby?"</p> <p>"God, yes!" she moaned. "I just can't take any more."</p> <p>I pushed her back and moved my lips over hers. I pushed my tongue and the tip of my tongue into her mouth in one motion before pulling away from hers and kissing down her jaw and over her neck. It felt as though my own lips were holding her breasts while my whole body rubbed against hers.</p> <p>"What's this doing to my body?" I asked, breaking our kiss and turning her around so that I could see her face and see her eyes.</p> <p>"You made me a cocksucker?" she replied as she looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"I guess we should just call it quits," I said. "It's kind of a nice trick to pull guys off. We don't want our partner to leave with an erection during the kiss."</p> <p>"It's not like it's a contest, you know," she said, laughing. "This is kind of a test for me to see if I can't make it out."</p> <p>"No, it's not," I agreed. "We need to do this again sometime."</p> <p>I felt her turn around and put her hands on her tummy to brace herself. The sight of her bare breasts while she leaned forward to face me was more exciting than anything that had ever been done to her before. A slight touch of her hand in my shoulder and she was out of my league. What did I know but that she'd be naked underneath this blanket in seconds and that I'd probably be fucking her in three or four hours. What was I going to do about fucking her in three or four hours? Should I wait until the next time? Should I really let her make me cum? I decided I'd let her get away with that.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"You're not so shy now, are you? You're a real nice guy, I'm sure you're up to a whole new level."</p> <p>"I'm glad I could come along," I replied, "I'd have thought that it was the start of another chapter of my life."</p> <p>"It really is getting to you, isn't it?" She smiled as she looked him up and down.</p> <p>"Sure is," I replied. "In your case, I'm just glad that we don't have to do this again, do you?"</p> <p>"No," she agreed. "Even with the rest of the week off, we still have the chance to experience whatever comes along."</p> <p>I felt my cock start to tingle in anticipation of what might finally comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
