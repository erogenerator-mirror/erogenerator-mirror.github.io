To be honest, I was really thinking about you and I thought about making love with you."</p> <p>"Oh." I was taken completely by surprise. But at the time, I felt totally flattered.</p> <p>"And what would your name be?"</p> <p>"I'm Jason. Jason McBride," I replied looking into her eyes.</p> <p>"Jason you can call me 'Mrs. McBride.' That will be so much fun," she said with a smile.</p> <p>I was speechless. I didn't think I was going to like this woman. We chatted non-stop for a long time. I had some time before she had to leave.</p> <p>"So do you have a family?" She asked, a look of curiosity on her face.</p> <p>"Actually no... I have a brother and a sister. I guess the oldest one is me."</p> <p>"Cool. Well thanks, I had fun," she said, walking over to me.</p> <p>"You too," I remarked, holding out my hand.</p> <p>"I want to be with you for a few minutes," she said, extending her hand.</p> <p>"Wow mom, you really had a lot of fun, isn't it kind of hard to say, "It's alright." We embraced and kissed. My hands slid down her back and under her skirt at times then up her back. We kissed each other long and hard. She had on an off white tank top, it was a white tank top I could make out the outlines of a bra. It had large yellow flowers on it.</p> <p>Then mom's hand slid down over my stomach and she grabbed my erection. For a second or two I thought we were going to go somewhere or maybe even go to my room, but then suddenly we broke the kiss and turned to leave.</p> <p>"Thank you, mom, for letting me come, I know I will thank you," I said, looking at her as we walked out the door, "But what if I did something like the one you did with me at your house a few weeks ago?" I said as we left.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" she replied.</p> <p>"Well mom I've never been with a woman before. But when I was with your father. I just thought it was nice that he might have gotten his mouthful of young pussy," I chuckled.</p> <p>I didn't know if she had been with anybody before, but after about the second time we had gotten talking I realized that I had been thinking that about her. I knew that sex wasn't just about the excitement. Sex was about having an exciting time with your mother. I felt a little ashamed that I thought of her as a woman. It was not true either.</p> <p>But I couldn't help but think of my mother. And I realized that I had just made a woman out of her.</p> <p>I had to give it a lot of thought before I decided to go ahead with this idea. In the end though, I made the decision that if I wanted to, I would enjoy my time with her. I thought it strange that she was interested. I was going to have some fun with her, but I also thought maybe it would be fun just to go with the flow.</p> <p>I walked into the kitchen and saw mom pouring herself drinks. I went into her living room and sat next to her. As soon as I sat down, she handed me a glass and I took a sip. I realized that my mother was wearing a light summer dress. Not a night shirt. I saw the back of the dress as the skirt sat on her round waist. As I tried to guess what kind of shape my mother was wearing, I tried to tell myself it was just the result of a few glasses of wine.</p> <p>There was more to it than I realized. My mother's body was just right. Her ass was shapely, the skin on her back, the cleavage, the top of her breasts, the curve of her tummy. My eyes were treated to her full breasts in a sheer bra. I could see the outline of her areola through the material, and a little brown nipple stood out in the center of it. Below that was the outline of her pussy as she moved in front of me. I had to look away. How could I?</p> <p>She was looking at me and touching the wine bottle and glass. After looking her over a little bit, she put it down on the table. Then she took another sip.</p> <p>"You know, Jason, you have to give me a glass of wine to clear my head before you go on with your life. I'll be fine, it willâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
