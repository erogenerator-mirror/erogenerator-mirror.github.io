She said, as she handed me a hand towel and handed it to me.</p> <p>"That's not very nice!" I said, as I ran to the head of the bath, towel drying my hair.</p> <p>"Nonsense," she said, as we stepped into the shower. "It's your choice."</p> <p>Once we both were dry, I turned on the shower and sat on the bench of the shower as she stood under the water, facing me as we kissed passionately. We rubbed our bodies together as we kissed. Our tongues danced with each other, as she started to rub her palms over my arms and back.</p> <p>She rubbed my nipples with her hands making me moan, as she tweaked them as she rubbed her wet palms over my torso. I was getting more turned on as we made out, our hands and bodies rubbing against each other. While holding each other's wrists, I turned my body so that my breasts were hanging down, rubbing them against each other. I continued this until we were both so turned on and wet we could barely stand. I turned on the shower, reached my arms down and let the water run over my body as I stood, feeling the shower as it cascaded down my body.</p> <p>As I leaned into the shower, getting the full effect, we each took turns kissing, my wet palms rubbing the front of her breasts, as her hands rubbed my back and bottom, which were on fire. Her legs opened as she slid her fingers inside my panties, pressing her fingers deep, while her thumb rubbed over my clit.</p> <p>"I can't help myself," I told her as I pushed her fingers deeper, causing me to moan out loud with pleasure.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm, I like that." She said to me, as she continued to rub and press her fingers inside my pussy.</p> <p>"Do you want to have a drink first?" I asked her, "or would you like me some wine?" I asked teasing her with my teasing.</p> <p>"It would be my pleasure," I said, smiling to myself as I held out her hand.</p> <p>We stepped in and she poured a long glass of wine as I poured us both a glass, as we each took our second glass. We had a long sip, enjoying how strong her taste was, as we continued to make out, our nipples rubbing against each other and my fingers playing with her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I take my panties off?" she asked me with a sexy grin.</p> <p>"Sure," I said, as we both reached down to take off my panties.</p> <p>She pulled the panties down to expose my bald pussy. I raised myself and pulled my panties down to my ankles, as she pushed them off to the floor and then started fingering me. My body tensed as she moved her body over mine, rubbing her pussy against my leg, as we kissed passionately, our hands roaming over each other's bodies.</p> <p>She took my erect nipple into her mouth and slowly licked and sucked on it as I reached down to rub her pussy with one hand. I reached behind me with my other hand to rub her pussy with my finger as she rubbed my nipples with her other hand.</p> <p>"I think we should change places." I said, as we stood, kissing for a moment, before I turned around so that my back was to her. She reached out her arms and pulled me closer to her as she kissed me deeply as my hand ran down her stomach.</p> <p>"I think I need to change position more, so you'd better stop touching me," I said, as we both began to kiss again.</p> <p>"Don't be silly," she said, smiling at me. "I told you last night you know you could come too."</p> <p>"I don't mind at all," I said, looking back to see her standing next to the shower, her fingers playing with her erect nipples again.</p> <p>"Don't forget to put some lipstick on first," she said as we kissed some more.</p> <p>"Ok, but be extra sexy today," I teased, as I pulled my fingers from inside her, then kissed her once more.</p> <p>"See you later," I said, as she pulled away, smiling at me. "I'll talk to you later."</p> <p>"See ya, soon," she said, before kissing me once more.</p> <p>"See ya later," I said to her.</p> <p>Once we were out of the shower and dried each other, I put my panties on, then looked at her, standing there in just her t-shirt.</p> <p>She stepped to me and kissed me, this time more passionately, as she pulled me to her, and rolled me on top of her, facing me this time. She pushed her finger into me, causing me to moanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
