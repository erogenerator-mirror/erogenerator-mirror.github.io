The subject wasn't particularly important, but the topic of the day was pretty important. When it came to business, her main motivation was her desire to keep up with the company. The woman took the time to look at people and ask them their fantasies, their feelings, their secrets. When she finally came to those, she would tell her what she wanted to hear. A lot of the men in her office would take her on short trips to the office and give her a real once-over.</p> <p>When I made an appointment, I did not go out. I made the appointment by getting a glass of wine or two with the client and watching the client take the first sip. The clients and I sat watching the man in the room, drinking his wine.</p> <p>I knew there were very good reasons not to have sex with a woman but I didn't see any reason as not to at least make a start. I thought about the fact that my wife, after her first year of marriage, had told me she had never had a lover. It was almost impossible to find someone she could spend the rest of her life with. I thought I was having my eyes opened by then but now I had to make all the connections available to her until I could do that. I also considered it as an invitation for a new experience. I was becoming more and more anxious about how I would find a woman for the evening.</p> <p>After two months of marriage, I finally had a new woman at home. She was about four years older this time. I didn't think she was interested in going any further with the marriage; I was wrong, I was wrong! However, I knew as soon as I saw her, her husband would be interested. It was one of the many reasons I was so good at giving women pleasure as part of the excitement of the new job. She was tall and slender with beautiful legs. She had the sexiest eyes I ever had.</p> <p>I approached her. She stood at five-eight and still was as sexy as when she was five-five. She had a lovely body, with smallish breasts and long, shapely legs. Her breasts were not huge but they were shapely and had shapely hips, nice round buttocks and the most beautiful smile. They were full and beautiful and I thought they might do a number on an old man.</p> <p>"Mona, you look gorgeous. Are you looking for a new guy?"</p> <p>"Yes. I'm looking for a new guy, a fellow from your company."</p> <p>I couldn't believe she had said this. She was clearly trying to pick me.</p> <p>"Of course I will be looking for a new guy. I have had this for almost four months. I don't know what I would call myself back for some of my work colleagues, but I would love for my company to have a future."</p> <p>"Ohmigod. You do want me to be your new assistant. That won't be much of a job, if I can help at all."</p> <p>"You can't."</p> <p>"There are benefits in having a new assistant."</p> <p>She laughed nervously.</p> <p>"You want to become my assistant? What could that be."</p> <p>We talked the rest of the evening over coffee, a few drinks, and talked about other things. Several men came by and we invited them home. I told her I had never been to her house and would like to see what a new assistant would be like.</p> <p>Later, I thought I had gone too far. I tried to give her all the things I had asked for, to help to get her promoted. After all, I was not one to be swayed. But with that little flimsy piece of clothing she wore, I think I had lost the battle in my head. I told her I loved having a new lover in my home and was looking forward to seeing how things would work out.</p> <p>She laughed.</p> <p>"That's sweet. Are you still going to be here?"</p> <p>"I have a lot of work still coming to me. I will need your advice. You have to agree on the things I was doing as part of your promotion."</p> <p>"What kind of advice would that be?"</p> <p>"I'm afraid I'm not sure how to answer that question. You have to know, with all the sexiness and the power you can get from our sex life, that you can't expect to have a new secretary to take care of. I have an opinion on that matter, but you have to agree to do the same for me. I do not want to be put in this big job you had in your life for any of our employees, but I agree that if you let me become your assistant, then I will take care of your company and the company I work for. We can set up a little arrangement for the new job that wouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
