With a growl of his own her body started to bounce up and down his cock, her wet pussy sucking on his cockhead with each thrust.</p> <p>It wouldn't be long before her orgasm would be so huge her body would clench his cock from pleasure. If she had been able to make that happen she would have a real happy and complete orgasm. That would be what he desired.</p> <p>She had been watching him with wide eyes wondering how his cock had gotten inside her. She wasn't even sure she had watched him fuck anyone. The pleasure he was giving her was as real as he. She was sure of it. She just wanted to make love with him for real. She wanted him to take her pussy. She was sure of it too; he would take her right there in the woods. She looked down and was surprised by how swollen and aroused her pussy was. She wanted that right where it was right now.</p> <p>John was watching her pussy as her legs went up over the top of the seat. Her face was all white and flushed from the intense feelings that she was now having. Her mouth was slightly open and he could see that her eyes were closed. Her chest tightened just a little as she felt a big orgasm starting.</p> <p>He watched the expressions on her face and knew it wouldn't be long before she was coming. He felt the rush just by her pussy on his cock. He was close too but he didn't want her to just jump the seat and fuck him. He wanted to enjoy her first. There was something about being in control but it was getting to be more like foreplay. There was no way on earth his cumming inside her would be the way it was being felt.</p> <p>She came. She orgasmed and her body shook hard. The feeling was so intense it scared her and sent a shock through her like fireworks hitting against air but it was so intense it made him want to fuck her even harder. That's when she opened her eyes and looked at him. She was amazed at how close she was to reaching orgasm again.</p> <p>"That is so good. I feel like my orgasm will never end. It just won't get any better. If you stay right there you'll make me cum again." She cooed as she looked into his eyes. She had to admit he was right. She certainly didn't want there to be any doubt about her feeling pleasure yet again. John was right in front of her. She wanted him, she really needed him.</p> <p>"Oh my God! How's it feel?" she asked as she put her hand on his shoulder. "That was amazing. I feel like I'm about to explode again." She thought about the look in his eyes at that moment. He was watching her. There was no doubt or doubt. She knew it. She knew it was all of him. Her body was starting to shake again. It scared her. All she could think of was the pleasure he was giving her. It had turned her on so much, she never knew it could be so good.</p> <p>"I want to cum too, so I pulled out. I pulled my cock out of you. Can you feel how hard I am again, I want to move inside you again." John said as he started to move with her again. They watched each other on the grass, he was moving really with her. Their bodies moved at a steady pace.</p> <p>He watched her face while he moved over her and moved his cock just right. He held her face with his right hand, he wanted to say how proud he was of her. So he didn't. He loved that she had allowed him to touch and be pleasured by her. He could not tell just how much he loved how beautiful she looked when she was in this state of bliss.</p> <p>"It feels so good to cum inside you again." John said as he felt his cock getting hard again too. "I want to give you that orgasm as much of a sensation as possible but I want you to cum for me again too."</p> <p>She didn't answer him she just laid there and enjoyed the ride he was giving her. She was really enjoying it but it was definitely getting harder to do this. She didn't know that she loved being loved but she loved his attention. It's never easy to just love someone as much as she does John. It's even harder to hate someone for loving them. This was just too wonderful to stop.</p> <p>"Keep rubbing my pussy. Oh...I'm so close!" She asked as she felt his cock begin to throb in her hand and her pussy. "I'm not stopping. Keep touching it." He said to her while looking back at her. Her beautiful face seemed to be all smiles right now. She loved the feeling of his cock pulsing in her hand. She smiled back at him and put his hand on her breastsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
