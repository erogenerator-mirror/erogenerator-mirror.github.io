She grabbed for my hand and we climbed into the car, her panties still on the floor beside us, and she drove off quickly. I couldn't stop the look of surprise on my face as I watched her get into the car. She had her arms around her legs and I'm sure she was grinning ear to ear.</p> <p>"You better drive," I said with a chuckle, and my heart started pounding.</p> <p>"Don't be silly," she said with a smile and a wink. "I already ate you out to."</p> <p>"I'll have just one thing for you," I said with a wink and a devilish smile. I was so fucking drunk that I couldn't have cared less.</p> <p>I pulled the car around back of the strip club and got behind the wheel. It was a little late to be getting this show, though. I wanted to feel her up and I know she had a great, tight ass as we went back to the hotel. It was nice and warm in the car and just added to the heat. I could see her nipples through her shirt. I had never noticed before how beautiful and sexy she really was, but I couldn't take my eyes off her.</p> <p>As we got to the hotel, she pulled my shirt off and gave a little yelp, then sat down right there next to me. I took my shirt off, still a bit out of breath, then climbed down into the tub again. I wanted to do it with her leaning against the side of the tub. I didn't even care that I was naked. I just wanted her to put her lips onto me, to taste me, to run her tongue over the hard little nipples that seemed to be poking out of the top of her blouse. I could go on and on about how sexy and exciting it was, but I was so drunk that I didn't want to talk about it too much. After all, it was a big moment to me. But if I'd heard anything out of her mouth before we got to the hotel she wouldn't let me talk about it.</p> <p>"I was wondering if you were a fan, too," I said with a nervous laugh.</p> <p>"I never have," she said. "I just think it's sexy and so sweet." She was still grinning. "Can't you see why I care?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I said, nodding. "I'd love to make it with you."</p> <p>"Really!" she said with a sparkle in her eyes and a smile on her lips. We both chuckled at that. I got out of the tub, grabbed my clothes, and we went into the hotel reception, where she told me that she wasn't going to be in until late that evening. I told her I probably only had about an hour left.</p> <p>We went through the front lobby and down the elevator to where I was waiting for her, and she followed me as we went through the reception. Once we were in the room she was in front of me on the bed and I could kiss her just behind her ear for a moment, then she'd have to get off the bed.</p> <p>"Okay," I said, as I took off my blouse. "But I haven't lost my appetite yet." I wasn't sure why, but I just kind of got into it, too. I liked it because it reminded me of when I was younger, and I didn't need anyone else to get horny. I was ready for an erection at a time like that; like maybe in a porn movie. And the idea that she might be able to put in a move she didn't want to did turn me on.</p> <p>The room we were staying in was very elegant and clean and modern all of it's own. The room had the largest king size bed I'd ever seen and the king-sized futon couch that ran the length of the end. You had to stand straight up to get into the comfy space, and for a moment I felt a bit dizzy from the drinks. Then she had me move in and we kissed again. We kept kissing and my hands moved up under her blouse, over her big tits and into the top of her shirt, fondling her through her bra. Then she had me sit on the couch while she took off her pants and panties and got back on. But instead of sitting down she turned around, bent over at the waist, and told me to strip off my pants and underwear. By that point I was so horny I could have fucked her right there and then.</p> <p>I had no idea how she would have felt though, of course, and I had no idea what her pussy would be like with those tight little shorts on. I knew she probably would have been very turned on by it and would have let me put my hard cockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
