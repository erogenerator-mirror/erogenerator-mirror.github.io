How is she?"</p> <p>"She's just as happy as ever. The only thing she said to me is that she's really happy that you're still here and that you still need me."</p> <p>"That's good." She looked away from me, "It was really nice talking to you Mike. I didn't get much time..."</p> <p>I walked her to the house.</p> <p>"Mike, we should talk," she said.</p> <p>I put my arms around her and gently held her.</p> <p>"Yes." I heard her say that in response.</p> <p>"We should talk about why we're here."</p> <p>We walked to the kitchen. She set her head down on the counter and grabbed the utensils that she and David had left for me. After she finished they left the table and sat down. I went to the front door.</p> <p>"So when's she getting ready? Are the kids going to come back?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's a while yet. Maybe we should just have dinner with them."</p> <p>"Oh, that would be great. I like that thought." I took my jacket off and hung it. I then went to the front steps.</p> <p>"What's your mind on this one? Are you looking forward to it?" She asked that as she was walking past me.</p> <p>'What her?' I thought.</p> <p>"Are you?" she asked.</p> <p>'No.' I thought. She's asking me to wait for her. I felt a pang in my heart. 'She'll be happy. She'll be happy to see me again."</p> <p>I took her hand and placed my index finger on her knuckles.</p> <p>"You're not going back to California until you have been living with me for a while. I'll move to Los Angeles next week and visit you. We can go to St. Louis in St. Louis."</p> <p>"That sounds nice." She replied.</p> <p>I walked her back into the house and then to my room. She looked over at me like she was a little boy looking at a candy store.</p> <p>"I don't have time for a kiss." She said it quietly.</p> <p>I was confused. I said, "We can make love. You don't have to ask, I know."</p> <p>Her eyes got big and she smiled at me. One arm was still around my neck. She kissed me, lightly and I responded.</p> <p>"Come back to me Mike." She said in reference to the kiss in the park.</p> <p>After a few minutes of touching and kissing we made our way to the bed.</p> <p>"It'll be late when they get back." she said in reference to the kiss in the park. My face burned red because she just kept kissing me.</p> <p>"Oh Mike. I really want this. I can't believe that I'm getting into this."</p> <p>"It does sound like a good plan. So far so good." I said.</p> <p>She pulled back and looked into my eyes, "It's okay. You really want this."</p> <p>"What's good is it's for real. I will tell you that much." I didn't want to sound too macho. The way I spoke to her, she didn't think of me to be that manly. She knew that a man wants a woman who will be a woman. In fact, she knew that she could be the first woman I was ever with. I loved her very much. She didn't expect me to make a man out of her.</p> <p>"Mike." I said as I pulled away. She looked at me. We kissed again. I had tears in my eyes. She looked at me with an expression that was sad.</p> <p>"I love you," she said.</p> <p>"That's great."</p> <p>She got on her bed. I climbed on the bed and we kissed again. After a few minutes she had her hands on my back, she squeezed me.</p> <p>"I love you," I said in response.</p> <p>Once again I kissed her while she squeezed me.</p> <p>"Oh Mike. Oh yeah. I love the way you kiss me. You just keep on doing what you were doing. You're a lot more mature than I was."</p> <p>"You're right," I replied.</p> <p>I felt her lips on me again. She kissed me.</p> <p>After a few minutes she started to rub my cock through my pants, "This is nice."</p> <p>"Maybe this is a turn on for you? You're hard again already."</p> <p>"I'm ready. Really hard. I hope you're ready."</p> <p>"I am." She didn't say anything. She just kept kissing meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
