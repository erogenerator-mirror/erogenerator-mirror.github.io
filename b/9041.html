I stuttered as they made me sit and I turned to look at them and see them both smiling back at my face. I still couldn't believe that this was happening between the two of them and what was happening right after their arrival. As I sat in a big leather chair near my table, the couple behind me made me smile and I watched them talk to each other and when they had finished, they began to laugh. I knew what they were laughing about.</p> <p>I continued to watch them as their conversation moved to a point of silence and I sat down at my table.</p> <p>"Hello," I said to them as they sat down. As the conversation went on a little longer, it ended and the man got up to leave.</p> <p>"I need to go," I said to them as I slid under the table and sat beside him. The one across from me started on my other cheek "We'll hang out for a bit."</p> <p>The man left me to continue our conversation and as he finished his business, "Thanks."</p> <p>As he stood to leave, I looked around to see what was going on and I was amazed at what seemed to be going on out here.</p> <p>"You guys were telling the truth about last night?" I asked with a laugh "This is way too weird".</p> <p>"It is the truth," the man said as he held his hand out toward me "It's not like you two had anything in it" he said as he pointed toward my wife" She's still a virgin and we've been married for seven years while she's not yet ready for the sex that we've had."</p> <p>"I could ask you the same thing about the sex we've been having then," I said to him "And I could tell that you two loved it more than we did. I'm sure she would love to be with another man."</p> <p>"No, we didn't just come here for a quick fuck!" he said to me "We're a married couple who love each other too much to be cheating on each other."</p> <p>"Yeah right," I said as I pulled both of our hands towards mine "We're just here for you to help us make up our minds."</p> <p>"Yeah huh," he said to me as he brought us both to our table "How about right here tonight when I get home that night?"</p> <p>"Do you really want to help us make up our minds," I asked them as they looked at each other and seemed to be debating on how to do this?</p> <p>"We could do that," he answered as he placed both of our hands on my wife's and placed his hands behind her head. The look on his face told me that he was thinking the same thing about what I was about to ask him.</p> <p>"It might be fun," he said as he pushed my wife's ear lightly into his mouth, "The more of it I take out of this, the closer it is going to be..."</p> <p>I moved my head towards my wife with a smile on my face as I sat down in the chair. I looked out into the back yard and saw that this was a good place to begin our planning. All of the bushes and shrubs had been cut down to make a lawn by the pool so that the lawn could be turned around for us to use. This was a great place to start this session. Here in front of us we could be able to talk more freely with someone who knows what they're doing. All of the other neighbors could watch us all come on into the yard and maybe even join in on this little chat.</p> <p>"Well since you're all up for it, what do you say, honey?" I said to her as I leaned over and kissed her as my hands took a hold of her beautiful breasts "If it doesn't turn you on to play with these, I wouldn't mind..." I smiled and stood up in front of her as my hands took another hold of her breasts.</p> <p>"Well I'm going to go clean up a little bit and then I think we're all going to have some fun," she said as her hands reached into my lap and soon she was fondling me and starting to kiss me as she kissed me back. I could feel her breasts press against me and her hands moved to my crotch and she pulled out my member as she kissed me and continued to do the same to me.</p> <p>"Now that we've made some plans, lets move on to a room where we can just have some fun while we wait for our spouses to come home from work then," she whispered into my ear as we got up and headed for the back bedroom. As I closed the door, I could see my wife's face looking up at me and smiling before she looked towards the hallway.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, here we are!"
