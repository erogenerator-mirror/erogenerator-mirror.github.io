She was all in, and even though not in my wildest dreams was her perfect. My cock throbbed as hard as it ever got, my hand going to her tits, squeezing tightly, massaging them, feeling them through her dress. I could see her eyes flicker, and I grinned at her as I moved my mouth down to her neck, kissing it, licking it, taking in the skin, drawing circles with my tongue around the collar of her dress. I slowly unzipped her dress, and it slipped down over her tits. One hand went to the top of her tit, while the other went to each of her tits. She let out a gasp as my mouth engulfed her nipple, letting me chew on it, drawing it into my mouth, while my hands went to her other tit, massaging and tweaking. My mouth traveled up her neck, taking in the taste and texture of her skin, and then down, licking and kissing her collar bone. I pulled my mouth away from her, and moved to her lap again, pulling her dress off as I dropped it to the floor.</p> <p>I leaned in to kiss her, and I could smell her smell, her natural perfume. For a couple seconds she stood in her heels as I leaned forward to kiss her. My mouth left her lips, and I could hear she inhale deeply, her eyes closed, and a slight moan out as I ran my lips down her neck. I could feel the goose bumps on her skin as my lips reached her collar bone, kissing where her shoulders met. Finally, I could wait no longer, moving my lips down her body, running down to her legs. As I neared her pussy, she gave a small grunt, and raised her hips of the chair, pushing her pussy into my mouth. I pulled my mouth away as my lips and tongue went to heaven on her clit, sliding my tongue along her lips, licking and tasting her. She was still hard as a rock, but that she had recovered as I ran my lips over her lips, tasting her juices, licking her lips, then down between her legs.</p> <p>She gasped as I slid down between her legs, letting me lick her pussy, running my tongue along her lips, tasting her, loving the taste of each touch. I kissed my way up one thigh, then the other, and took each into my hand, feeling the softness and warmth of her body underneath. I could tell she was enjoying the sensation of having my mouth on her, as she lifted her ass off the chair to meet my every touch. I could hear her breathing harder as I licked her outer lips, circling them softly, pulling them apart with my fingers while lightly licking and pressing the inside of them, feeling the texture of her skin. I slid my tongue up and down inside of her as I licked her pussy, tasting the sweet and sticky juices, her scent filling my nose, her taste slightly salty. I wanted to make love to her right then, but I had to move slowly, or I could climax and I already had cum to the idea of her tasting her own juices, but I was afraid she would come first. I ran my hand up her body, squeezing her tits, my lips went to her nipples then to her neck, sucking softly, lapping over her as I rubbed my tongue over hers. I could feel her shaking as she came, and my cock went hard as iron, pushing between her legs, wanting more. I couldn't take it anymore, my lips went back to her clit, pushing my tongue hard into her, sucking gently as I licked at her, knowing the taste of her and wishing I could taste her pussy right now. I slid my fingers back to her nipples, pulling, twisting, circling then pinching with my fingers as we came down from her orgasm, kissing her as we lay there in the chair.</p> <p>We kissed some more before she pushed me back down in the chair, spreading her legs. I slid down so I was lying between them, and she sat up, giving me a smile as she reached down the front of her dress. Her panties were see-through, and her pussy was glistening with her cum still on her lips, and she leaned down to look at me, her tits heaving as her breathing slowed. She ran her hands down my body to my chest, massaging my shoulders, stroking and rubbing her hands along my body as she stood up. She walked over me, stopping at my lips, our pussies grinding together while we both moaned.</p> <p>"Take off these," she said as she took my shirt, and tossed it around my neck. I reached behind her head, untying the laces, her arms coming up to take mine, and my arms. Holding me still as she dropped to her knees before me, taking off my shoes and socks, setting them on the floor. She began to run her hands upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
