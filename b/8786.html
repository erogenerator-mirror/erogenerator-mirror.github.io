I had a warm smile on my face and she looked relieved. My face turned even more determined and I began to slowly massage her hair back from her face; she took a deep breath and closed her eyes at the same time. She kept her eyes closed as I worked out her throat muscles, her neck muscles, as well as her cheeks. She was so relaxed and so beautiful.</p> <p>With my fingers I began to move up to her chin, pushing it out slightly so as not to leave it out completely of the massage I was now applying to her entire face. I could feel the heat of her skin on my finger as I pressed my finger to her neck to rub there deeply. It felt so soft and smooth as my finger moved through it. She kept her mouth shut as if not to say anything about anything.</p> <p>I massaged her temples very slowly, using my fingers to massage the skin which was very tight and not quite relaxed like a massage. She let out a little sigh. I rubbed her face from top to bottom softly in small circular motions before moving my hands down to her chin. She began to slowly rock forward again as the oil hit her face and neck muscles. After a while I pushed her hair aside so that I could lean forward and put my hands into her neck, starting with long, lingering massage movements which led me to her chin and up to her throat. She had been in the position where she could see me all the time as I massaged with her hair and neck, not just watching my hands sliding down her body.</p> <p>She could do nothing but move her jaw to the side to let me know I was on the right track. My hand moved to her chin and it was so warm and so soft, so warm that I could just take in a deep breath.</p> <p>She was not in any danger of saying anything so I just began to slowly and methodically work on her neck. It was almost like I was trying to feel every inch of her, my arms, her face, her body as I worked her.</p> <p>I moved around her a little, just getting to the middle of her neck before beginning to work my way back down to her head. Her body felt really good now. I was getting very turned on by what we were doing. It must be a good thing that you are such good hands, as I continued to massage her head with only the slightest amount of pressure and gentle brushing my fingertips against hers. She was completely unaware of anything except that her head was tilted back as if to me.</p> <p>I moved my hands down her sides and took her hands in mine again, this time placing them on either side of her head. Her hands remained in place, her head tilted back on the massage table. There was no doubt she loved that position. Her arms were around my neck and her whole body was pressing my thighs on hers. She was so good, so natural.</p> <p>I used the opportunity of her relaxing jaw and neck to move my hands to the side of her face. I moved my hands away from her shoulders and moved my hands back up to her temples. I felt her body as a whole, not just the head of my cock. As I moved my hands over her temples and down her neck to her shoulders I could feel her hands on my chest and then her back; her shoulders and back. I moved my hands down to her waist but left one arm on her lower back and the other just above her ass. I ran my hands down her body and back again, taking in every inch of it as I did. She let out a sexy moan.</p> <p>As I was doing this she had her eyes closed, so I did not know she had been concentrating on me. I began to work on her legs again, which didn't really help but I could always work my way back up to her thighs, which were a lot more toned from the way she was doing her neck. I moved back down and massaged her thighs again as I did her upper legs. I felt so excited by this point.</p> <p>I stopped for a moment to let her get her breath back. She was so much relaxed that she was almost as good as I was at this massage routine. She had a very sexy, relaxed look on her face. I had to admit, it was also kind of sexy as well. I continued up to her crotch again; my hands moving on her thighs just as before. I felt every inch of her as I moved them around. I was really getting into this for it, even if I never saw my own cock go that way. She must have really liked that because she had a small bit of a smile on her face.</p> <p>By this point I couldn't wait. I leaned my head forward and slowly placed my lips right over hers once again.
