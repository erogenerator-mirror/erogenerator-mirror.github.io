He could even smell her cum on her and it reminded him of her earlier, as he gently slid his fingers along her lips. He moved down to her stomach, where her leg remained in the water and he pushed a finger between her legs, up towards her pussy. She leaned her head back a little, as if she was asleep and her nipples were still getting hard. He could also tell she was awake enough to feel the wetness he was sending up her leg, which she didn't immediately realize. She turned around so he could remove his hand completely, her legs still a little wobbly and still in the water.</p> <p>"Ummm, that feels so good baby" she cooed as she felt his hand between her legs again. She had gotten very used to these, he knew. She spread her legs a bit more as he continued to kiss her neck and his hardening cock was right in front of her. He was so hard he felt his stomach knot and he was really wishing it would happen right here, next to her. She reached up, grabbed his cock and moved it closer to her pussy. She leaned back, closed her eyes and smiled at him as the head of his cock was finally between her lips and she slowly started to push it into her. It felt so good, but he started to pull it back out slightly.</p> <p>"Not yet," she teased as she pushed her hips closer so he could feel his cock go a little further in. She was still in the water and it made him nervous, she didn't know what was going to happen in the other room and this would also be a bad thing for him before he left. He slowly inched his cock further and further into her before he could ever think about it. He then slid it back out and she started to stroke him even more. All the while she was smiling at him and talking soft to him and he could have given up and just gone to sleep right now. He didn't do anything, just let her gently stroke his cock to slow it down once again. Her touch on his cock was sending a bolt of pleasure through his body and he could feel his balls tightening up for a release. He looked at her, she was smiling and he could see she was breathing hard a bit, so he moved down to where he was just in front of her.</p> <p>She looked at him, the look was different, somehow, in a way a sexual one. It looked like she had a little lust in it, she was really enjoying his cock in her hands and she loved the sounds of pleasure escaping her little mouth as he fucked her. He was now fucking her hard and fast with just about as much force as he was getting inside. He could feel the tension increase with every thrust and knew he wouldn't last long at this pace. But he was loving it and he knew he wanted to get in a second load of hot cum deep inside her. She looked up at him and he met her eyes and said he was about to cum, he started thrusting harder and deeper into her. "Ummmmmm...mmmmm...oh, my God." She said, as he was about to say it out loud, but he pulled his cock out of her and then his hand had gone down to her bare pussy so he could start finger fucking her, making her body shake and groan with pleasure. He went back up her body and he kissed her neck so he left a finger on her clit as he fucked her.</p> <p>"Oh, God." Just then the door opened and both of them were looking out at the living room. He was startled, but she quickly grabbed his hand and pulled him up and towards the door. "Wait" she said when they got to the bedroom. "Let's go get a better view."</p> <p>She pushed him back against the wall and straddled him, as she reached under herself and found his cock. He couldn't resist her touch and moved one hand down to her little pussy.</p> <p>"You little tease," he said, as she pulled his cock inside her then grabbed his ass and pulled him into her hard. They looked into each other's eyes as she felt her pussy stretching around his hard cock. She knew he was close and pushed him backward towards the bed. She started to fuck him slowly at first then started to move it up and down, not quite as fast but still enough to keep his cock in her. She then started to bounce up and down on top of his still hard cock. This was a different feeling than fucking him, and he didn't really have to hold on for her anymore. It felt good to be inside her, to feel those little quivering ripples of sexual excitement that she was giving off and enjoying like nothing else was happening. She rode him harder and faster now and he could feel her juices coming outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
