"No more. No more! I need to see him. I need to find out what he did."</p> <p>With that, the door slammed shut, and I closed it tightly behind me. I stood there, shaking as the phone rang again. I had to be alone.</p> <p>I walked over to the phone and set it on the table. "Hello," I said flatly.</p> <p>"He called? Did you get called?"</p> <p>I sighed, turning to look at her, standing next to me, an arm wrapped around me. "I just ran to the phone," I answered. "Maybe he heard me. Maybe it was you calling. Or maybe not."</p> <p>"Oh, come on," she said, stroking my chest with one hand. "You're not going to leave me like this."</p> <p>"I love you, Jessica," I whispered as I pushed up her shirt, feeling the firm flesh of her breasts. "I love you, too."</p> <p>"No, you're not. Maybe he came to catch you," she pointed out. "You're not letting go of him, baby. Listen to me. How hard you made me cum, for a minute. For more than that. For the whole weekend," she continued. "You can't let a man leave me now, baby. You can't," she stopped. "I love you, too. I need to tell you everything I found out."</p> <p>I just stood there, trying hard not to cry. I looked back to her and she shrugged her shoulders. "I'm sorry," she whispered, a tear rolling down her cheek. "I just need him here right now."</p> <p>"Just listen to me, okay?" I said, trying not to cry anymore. "How bad do you want it?" I asked once more.</p> <p>"Oh, damn," she said, shaking her head. "I don't know," she said, looking down. "I don't even care," she told me.</p> <p>I turned and looked at her, the phone still lying on the table. "Don't you want me to call, too?" I asked with a grin. "Or just hold it here until you want it back when you think about us?"</p> <p>"Oh, God, don't do it," she groaned as I reached down and grabbed the phone, placing it, and the cell into my lap. She looked at me, and I smiled as I continued to look at her.</p> <p>"Are you there?" she asked, sounding concerned as I held the phone out for her to pick up.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered. "In the bedroom, or out there, right now. Why are you even answering me?"</p> <p>"Because," she said as I placed the receiver back into the cradle. "Because after this weekend," she pointed at me as we both watched as I fumbled. "We're not alone. But my father-in-law is there."</p> <p>"That's too bad for me," she finished.</p> <p>"If he was on the phone, too, I wouldn't have to be here with you," I assured her, smiling as she nodded her head in agreement.</p> <p>"Yeah, but it's good. My husband is gone. He's doing that trip to the Bahamas for a week, and if I was not already in town, he'd be in New York tonight, too. But you can stay, right? You don't have to go back." She paused and then sighed deeply, shaking her head. "I'm sorry," she whispered. "Of course I want you to go, you didn't have to come."</p> <p>I nodded, hoping for some understanding, though I was still a little concerned to see her face, for any reason. She nodded her head emphatically, agreeing. She'd have to take me on at this point, too, and I knew she'd take me on. She'd be so much more fun to have around now.</p> <p>"Good," I said quietly as I put the phone in my hands once more, turning to look at her, but she held me in an embrace. "I don't understand," I murmured to myself as tears began to well up in my eyes. "But I don't even really care," I added, trying to find a way of explaining why I wanted to hold her so tightly.</p> <p>"I know," she answered. "I understand." She didn't even say it, but just pulled away from me slowly so her face dropped into a deep, happy frown. "I'll come."</p> <p>I nodded, feeling defeated as she turned and headed out the door. "And maybe you should, too, after he finds out he did something wrong," I told her as I grabbed the phone from her hand.</p> <p>"I guess," she sighedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
