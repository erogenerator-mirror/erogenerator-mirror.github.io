I leaned back, arching my back, thrusting my ass out, I was so turned on.</p> <p>"Well, I think the party's over." He said quietly. I raised my head, smiling, "Do you mean to stay or is this over in only 30 seconds?" "Oh, it's more than over, I love to have you do that to me." I answered.</p> <p>"I wouldn't be able to take more, you are so beautiful." He said. I kissed him again, he pulled me to him, his hands roamed over me, his fingers found my sensitive nipples. I ran my fingers through his short dark hair.</p> <p>"I want you to lie back on the couch. Spread your legs wide and move them towards mine." I said. "You have so much going on in all of my head. I feel so complete when we're together. I want to please you, to make you feel exactly what I feel. Will you please take me for all I am?" He said.</p> <p>I couldn't take it any longer, I looked him in the eye, "I am yours if you stay." I said.</p> <p>I went over to the night stand and took out some lube. He looked at me, he had been watching me. I was wearing a black thong. I opened up, the black material stretched over my ass, I knew exactly what he wanted, I didn't bother with a bra, just pulled the material in tight. I moved so he could see my tits. He smiled at my hard nipples and the hard pucker of my nipples between my fingers.</p> <p>He took me in hand, he took me into his mouth, licked my nipples, took them into his mouth, sucked them. My ass cheeks were moving, I was moving on both sides. I knew that if I stayed still, this would not feel wrong, it would feel good.</p> <p>I heard him open the top of the condom and felt him place it on.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if I should get it on you right here, I'll be doing that later." I said, smiling. He kissed me again, "No, stay right where you are, I'll be back in a moment." He walked back to the couch, I moved so the back of the couch was against the back. I lifted my leg on the couch, he got the tube of lube out of his night stand and put it on the end table. "I want you to lie right there, don't let go, spread your legs, and just lay back." I did I did to him. "Your ass is so lovely, I just want to kiss it. I want to feel your cunt, I want to lick it and make love to it, how can I be doing this to you, right in front of you?"</p> <p>"Well, if you keep doing this to me, I'm sure we'll get more than that. I just want to spread for you. I want you to move, I'm going to get on my hands and knees, my tits are at the level of your mouth I'm sure." I said. Again, I wasn't sure, I looked back at him, wanting to see his reaction, I wanted him to be turned on, I wanted him to be in charge.</p> <p>That's the way it played in our lovemaking. We were like that forever, I knew that. Sometimes he would get to me, sometimes we'd get to him. I was his. I was in charge. I liked being in control. In a way, it made it all the more special. One thing though, was he would always use the safe word. I couldn't use it, he probably did. He could still catch me, but there was also a chance he caught me walking over to my car. He didn't think he would ever find me in this situation, I just didn't know.</p> <p>"Do it to me, suck me to completion and make me feel it." I said, reaching for his hand.</p> <p>"I will if that will make it all better." He said softly, "Now lay on your back." He said, his eyes looking right at me. "Please don't move." I said, taking his hand from in my top leg holding it, lifting my leg so I could lay it out on the arm.</p> <p>With a smile on his face he smiled at me, "My hand is going to touch the outside of your pussy if you don't move."</p> <p>He slowly moved it under my skirt, sliding his hand over my wet pussy lips, pressing a fingernail between them I was wetter than before. He smiled, he really was feeling me up.
