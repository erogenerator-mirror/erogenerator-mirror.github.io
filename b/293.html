Sarah said as she helped me move the dishes out of the room. I helped her out of the kitchen then got her off her kitchen bar and onto the bed.</p> <p>"I don't think so." I muttered to her, she had a wicked grin on her face. I was going to have to get that grin down.</p> <p>"Yeah I'm sure we can make it up to you, how about tonight?" She asked, with a mischievous glint in her eye. Sarah was always on my mind.</p> <p>"Sure." I said, trying not to be coy. "This is where it all started."</p> <p>"Yeah I can handle it." Sarah said, laying back down, her eyes glistening from the night chill. I pulled the curtains back and got in bed with her, my arm resting around her. They were spooning and slowly moving up and down on each other, I put my arm around her and we fell asleep again. I woke up about twenty minutes later with Sarah pulling up her shirt, covering her tits. I smiled and gave her a kiss as I slipped out of bed. I walked out the bathroom and went downstairs, where my new playmate was sitting at the table. I knew she'd be back soon enough. I knew this was going to be good.</p> <p>As I walked into my house Sarah was up in her room. I saw her standing by the door checking messages. I opened the door and Sarah came in quickly, her shirt pushed up over her tits and exposed. I was speechless as she bent down to see what I had written for her.</p> <p>It was a big beautiful pink bikini. I couldn't help but notice that she had it on underneath. But most of the time she didn't bother putting them on. She just disappeared from my view as she looked to the door. I got off the couch and grabbed for my shorts, leaving the tent on the couch in the way, pulling my cock out in front of her. She smiled at me and I walked into the hallway, closing her bedroom door. She stayed in the hallway a bit longer looking at messages until I finally gave up and let myself out the front door. The first message was for the car, and the next to it was from a guy, probably one of the other guys from the office. The next was from her again. A couple messages left from her on the couch as she stared blankly out to the night. I closed the front door as best I could, turned around and ran down the stairs.</p> <p>As I got in the car I started it and drove around to the side of the house she was on. I watched her until I could make out her profile, and the number one spot where I wasn't looking. I was thinking about how long it had been since I had last had sex. I had been so turned on by watching Sarah. When she started talking I couldn't help but keep stroking my cock to my balls. Then I found myself thinking about her, how beautiful she was, how fucking perfect. If she kept talking like that I would never be able to get this off my mind. I turned her head to me and kissed her. Her hands snaked around my neck and she kissed me back. I broke the kiss and pulled back,</p> <p>"We have to see if we can come over here." I said. She just smiled and started the car and backed out of the driveway.</p> <p>My mind was on the events of the past day. I wanted to go to her so badly I was shaking. I wondered if my cum would really hit the car, and if it would be worth the chance to get to her.</p> <p>My thoughts were racing through my head, what if she actually wanted to do this, what if it actually worked. I turned into the drive and stopped my car. Then I began pulling into my driveway and started walking into the house. I saw Sarah just sitting by her couch, watching something on TV, I could tell she was getting horny. I walked past the living room, her house looked so amazing. I opened the back door as I came in and walked in.</p> <p>"Hey, what is it?" She finally spoke, with a smile on her face.</p> <p>"It's nothing." I said with a shrug.</p> <p>"No, it's fine, it's just." She smiled back, then I could see her putting something on the couch. I didn't know what, since I was not paying attention to her. Then I realized she was looking at my package, I mean was it even worth being a virgin?</p> <p>"What was that?" Sarah asked, looking back over her shoulder at me.</p> <p>"Nothing, it's nothing." I said back, she was giving me a hard time.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Nothingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
