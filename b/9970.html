He couldn't help the tears. He tried to get control of himself and he made a conscious decision not to. At that moment, he knew for sure he'd never be able to keep this little scenario from happening again. He looked around the room, as if he hadn't noticed what this man had just told him. He glanced at his watch once more, realizing he'd been staring for more than a half hour. He looked back to where she was sitting, her chest still heaving slightly with each heartbeat. She looked different, more sensual; perhaps the feeling of being near him had left her as sexy to him as he was to.</p> <p>"You're right," she said, turning to glance at him. She looked down at his pants and began to unbuckle his belt. "But here..." She reached in her purse and opened drawer. She pulled out a small wooden box and removed a red satin box, looking at herself as she said "this is the 'little friend' you told me about." She opened the box, taking out a few small lengths of silk scarves and laying them across his face. She slid the tie back, binding him to the bed.</p> <p>"How the did you know about the 'little friend'?" she asked, smiling as she began to run the scarves lightly down his arms, tracing each individual vein with her foot.</p> <p>"It's a little secret from most people."</p> <p>"I can't believe I just told you," she said, nodding towards the box in his lap, her eyes looking towards the scarves. She looked back at him, biting her lip as she sat on the bed again, turning over some papers to take with her and then sitting on the edge of the bed. She watched as his eyes wandered, looking at the books she had picked out, wondering if he had even noticed the box in his lap. He glanced towards the clock on the night stand as he heard it hitting the green button three times, knowing her time was ticking away as she worked the clock. "I...oh," he said, sitting up. "Uh...are you...doing something for me," he said, sitting up against the headboard, her legs stretched up and wide open.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied, sitting up and sitting in his lap. "I wanted to do something for you today...I don't remember what I wanted," she told him. He sat up, seeing she wasn't wearing any panties. "Oh," he said, watching her smile as she put her feet to his mouth. He leaned closer to her then, putting the head of his cock against her pussy. "Uh..." He watched as she pushed back, her hips arching against his dick eagerly. "Yeah, I want you to...please, take me, please?" He watched as she arched her back and closed her eyes while she took his cock and pushed harder against it, biting her lower lip as she pushed back against him. "I can't believe it!" he said, trying to pull away and pull her up to her knees, but she leaned in, pulling down his pants to his ankles before he could even get to them. He looked down her body, her legs splayed, as he watched her wrap her feet around his legs. "Is this what you want?" she said, running her hands from his knees to the top of his thighs. He looked away again, turning his attention to the clock, then back to her before he could stop himself. She pulled down his boxers, watching him as he looked at her. He looked down at her, reaching for her, but she held up her hand. "No, you can't," she said quickly, looking away. "Fuck myself on your cock..."She laughed a little as she held her hand, then began to push her pussy onto his cock, slowly letting his head slide into her. She sat still, taking it in slowly, letting her body adjust. "Oh, oh, oh," she moaned, watching as he moved his hand on his balls. He took his phone out, taking his time while she slid forward onto his lap, pushing him back from her. "Don't come in me," she said quietly, looking up at him, biting her lip. He smiled, watching her as he moved his hand to stroke her breasts. "No, take me," she demanded, then turned around and sat on his lap, facing him. "Fuck me..." she said, holding the back of his head as she sank down onto his dick. She leaned against him, moaning softly as he slowly moved inside her. He pulled her hair, watching as she arched her back and arched herself as he pushed her off his lap.</p> <p>"Mmm, just like that...fuck me..." She closed her eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
