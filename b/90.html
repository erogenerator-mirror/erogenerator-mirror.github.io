I glanced over my shoulder. A young woman stood outside my bedroom door. Her name tag read Rachel.</p> <p>"Um... Rachel. You're not... just... well... " I sputtered, and then remembered. "You're not... your... Rachel. You can't be. I'm not. I'm married. I told you I was having an affair."</p> <p>Her face quickly changed to shock as she turned around. The girl stared at me curiously for a moment and then went on. "I told him to make sure there was no one else in the house. I told him to keep his hands from pawing at me. He looked like he was going to say something, but somehow it didn't. I had to tell you. It took every bit of willpower I had not to throw up all over your pretty face when you saw me." She pulled a sheet up to cover herself. "He really wasn't looking for a wife, that's for sure. He had plenty of money to go to the right places."</p> <p>I tried to smile a little, to be nice. "It wasn't like that. He didn't want to hurt me."</p> <p>"He's the one who's had problems, isn't he? " Rachel shot back, "And if you haven't noticed, he's been getting into the wrong house. He had gotten his hair in a dirty little bun that he had thrown up and left when he realized he wasn't good enough for you"</p> <p>I just sat there quietly. The shock wore off a little bit at the revelation that Rachel was married to another man. I had thought I'd done it in a very sweet and sexy way. "Is he... "</p> <p>Rachel just shook her head. "He's... not that much better. He's like average size, that's all. He hasn't had a girlfriend, of course. He's been looking for a girl for quite a while, so there just wasn't any way to get anyone else. I told him the man's been banging around in that damned hole of a motel. I'm afraid I screwed things up with you tonight." She sat down on the bed and started to cry. I had never seen a girl cry before.</p> <p>Rachel took a deep breath. "I didn't know he was cheating on me," she said sadly. As quickly as she could, she sat back and began to cry again. When she was done she sat up too. "I guess I was pretty weak," she said. "Why don't we just forget this ever happened?" She took two tissues out from the box on my night stand, started to wipe herself down. "No. That's not a good idea. It doesn't even look like that cheating bastard you married is fucking on the sheets of this bed!"</p> <p>"Don't blame yourself if he is," I said with an underhand stroke of my hand. "He didn't deserve you."</p> <p>Rachel just looked at me in surprise. "You said that guy hadn't ever been in the place you're in now and found somebody else."</p> <p>I shook my head at her. "I told you, it's just not that way"</p> <p>Rachel took another tissue and wiped her face and then looked down at it. "So... what's so all of a sudden? "</p> <p>I shrugged my shoulders. "Not really. He didn't tell me he'd been in the place, either. He was in there with me. He'd found that woman in the back room. She was a virgin. I don't know why he wouldn't have been after me. I'm going to go back and tell him right now. He should be able to take care of himself, don't worry."</p> <p>Now it was Rachel's turn to shake her head. "I can't believe those little dits he married! He just can't get her, that's all!"</p> <p>"Not my problem, " I whispered, hoping for another chance.</p> <p>Rachel's face was redder than my bare pussy while she stood up. Her tears were smeared and running down her cheeks. She reached out her arms to me and said, "I'm sorry I brought it up. I need to get dressed. I'll call you in a few days."</p> <p>She threw her arms around me and held me tightly while we cried together. I don't know where the tears had come from. It had been a long time since any of us had seen someone else, much less been together with someone else. After a few more minutes, one at a time I hugged Rachel back. I couldn't tell how long we stayed like that. We lay next to each other on the bed for a while. When, finally, she could take it no longer she pulled her head back and threw a pillow over my faceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
