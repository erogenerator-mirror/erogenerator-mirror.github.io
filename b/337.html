"I can't see the park...it's gone...oh my God, it must be gone...I'm so sorry...I didn't mean...I didn't know...I'm sorry," she wailed as she held herself so still my prick was almost touching her face.</p> <p>"It's alright," I whispered in her ear. "That's all it is..."</p> <p>"No it isn't," she insisted but only after I began to slowly stroke my prick to a full erection.</p> <p>This was it. Now I felt as if I would blow any second. I was so nervous because I was so aroused and wanted to get her off. She was the first woman I had touched that night and she would be the first woman I had just jerked off for. I didn't want to go home with my throbbing prick sticking up so I told her.</p> <p>"Do it!" she insisted in a husky murmur and her hand pulled me on top of her so that I had my erection pressed against her pussy. I moved my prick to where it hovered against her but didn't penetrate her. I lifted her legs up so I could lay my body flat and began to rub the head of my prick against the moist cleft between her legs until I found the pouting little fold where her labia lips closed around my prick at it's root.</p> <p>"You're so wet!" I told her as I slowly pushed my erection into her cunt and held still, enjoying my penetration of her.</p> <p>"No, no, no...I don't want to...it's so wrong..." she whispered but had begun to stroke her clitoris.</p> <p>In the darkness, she pressed her hips up to me until I was buried to the hilt in her little tunnel of flesh. I had to lean forward to kiss her lips and she returned the kiss; the tongue was no longer needed. I had to kiss her lips.</p> <p>"Oh my God, Kate, you're so tight and I can't believe I'm inside you. I always thought you'd be happy in a man's arms."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like me," she replied. "I don't like it because it's wrong."</p> <p>I just held myself inside her and began a steady thrusting rhythm in and out of her wet tunnel. I lifted my head and looked at her face as she lay beneath me, her eyes closed and her breathing as if deep and heavy as she had when she'd been asleep. The hair was mussed and her eyelids were fluttering, still, but they were alive and moving on to try and get oxygen into them.</p> <p>It took my breath away at that moment. I had just fucked a young woman! I was going to fuck her! I could do it any time I liked! I started to pump harder and harder, getting almost frantic and the pleasure was like nothing I'd experienced before. If I thought I was going to come quickly I knew I'd best get a move on. I reached forward and clutched her shoulders, trying to keep her under me and keep my prick deep within her.</p> <p>I must have dozed because when I opened my eyes I found Kate standing at the far end of the bed watching me through heavy lidded eyes. She was smiling but in some way looked uncomfortable. I felt bad for her because I had made her feel she had to do with what I wanted.</p> <p>At the same time, I understood her problem. I hadn't made any demands; it was just us two women making love under the moonlight in one bed. And when she saw what I was doing, she smiled and looked at me the same way I was looking at her. She closed her eyes and looked away but her smile was replaced by one of pleasure.</p> <p>I put my arms around her and pulled her over onto the bed beside me. She didn't move at all. She lay beside me and I pulled her closer into my arms. She was still holding me so tightly and it felt good not to be straining between us.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she murmured in my ear before she opened her eyes again. I kissed her lips.</p> <p>"Kate!" I said softly. "What are you doing? Why haven't you turned over?"</p> <p>"I want to watch this, but you have to hold me," she said, opening her eyes to look up at me and smiling again. She looked nervous but at least I thought she was looking at me more than her smiling.</p> <p>"Is it okay?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I want to be held like this, not just held. I want to feel it," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
