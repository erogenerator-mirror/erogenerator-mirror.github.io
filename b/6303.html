It's a bit strange but soooo funny, don't you think?</p> <p>I looked a little hurt, to be honest.</p> <p>"No I'm not. I'm sorry, but it's not the time. It has been ages, all of two years. What am I going to do about the time we've had?"</p> <p>He had a pained expression for the whole thing so I knew better than to give him the wrong idea. Well sort of a pep talk.</p> <p>"But I think I would like to think so. I think I'll have a great time, even if we only have to be civil to each other. I mean, with the way you've been acting since you've gone out. You can see why I want to do this. It's going to get better and better, don't you think?"</p> <p>He looked at me a little weirdly for a moment then just smiled and clapped my hand over my mouth before sitting back. He looked rather hurt. I gave him a sort of half smile.</p> <p>"It's all sorted then," I said brightly. "I won't rush this, but let's get some drinks and see how we feel about it."</p> <p>After a few minutes he left to go to one of the local pubs and the bar he'd never had a chance to visit before. I thought it strange because I was never one to go on to town alone, and although I had some friends, I didn't go all that often. The idea of getting a drink, especially when there was beer up on the end of the bar and a chance to chat and get to know the people who came to drink, sounded really wrong. I thought I shouldn't have gone alone at that point, but I still thought he was going to say anything.</p> <p>We sat on the floor chatting for a few seconds until he took my hand and kissed me on the cheek. We were both looking out of the window when I felt his soft hand slide round my waist and up to cup my breast. He let his hand slide up and under the front of my jumper then to my left breast. He gave my nipple a gentle squeeze, and then he kissed me on the lips. He slipped both hands up to cup my right breast while sliding his hands down my skirt. I didn't take it off but lay there with my arms around his neck while he slid my jumper off.</p> <p>"Well, we've come to the part about this sort of thing" said he seriously. "If you'll sit on my lap facing me for a moment, I'll take off your jeans and then we can talk, if you like. Do you like to see me naked, just as much as I like having me naked?".</p> <p>"Mmmmmhmm, yes" I answered.</p> <p>I sat down in his lap and he let his hands slide down my back till he were cupping my bottom. He slid both hands down to the top of my bottom-less panties and pulled them down, leaving them on top of my thighs. His fingers were moving around my pussy and I could feel his fingers slipping between my outer lips and pushing and poking inside me. His fingers felt great. I sat back for just a second. He was looking straight down at my pussy, his fingers rubbing me as I played with his hair at the back of his neck, or just looking at me. I loved what was going on, being naked in front of him as I sat there completely naked. I felt so excited to be sitting on that hard, smooth surface with me so exposed and open to him. His fingers moving inside me and his tongue licking my lips, he slid one inside me and pushed it against my clitoris, making me moan and writhe. His other hand reached round to cup my left breast, pushing it up from my body. My breasts were so large and full and perfect; I felt so wanted by him. He kept his fingers there to continue rubbing my clitoris but never slipped them deep into me as he continued pressing my whole body. I put my hands behind his head to pull him on to me, so it wasn't as hard as before, but it was definitely more comfortable, and I could feel his hard cock as it pressed into my backside.</p> <p>He slipped his hands down to my rear to reach around to cup and stroke my breasts, which he started to roll over his face. I was feeling so wicked, being totally naked in front of him, being feeling naughty and exposed.</p> <p>"You look flushed, are you alright, you look flushed"</p> <p>"Oh god yes" I said, my head feeling very light.</p> <p>"You look amazing to me, your skin is soft and warm and I can see you in the moonlight. You're so beautiful and I love your nipplesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
