It is probably a good thing a girl knows what she wants -- you know what to do. I'm just as horny today as I was yesterday, so I was ready to go to town. I'd only wear my dress when you wanted me! Of course, I chose the panties as that was another good thing -- especially when you want to tease me...</p> <p>It came to me that it would be a very interesting evening, so I was already thinking of the best way to get out of here as soon as possible. I was looking forward to a good hard fuck, and I just knew that if he was good tonight, I was going to be having one to myself for a change. I quickly put on my new dress.</p> <p>I had to pee first. Not very fast, but it's nice to get in before someone will see. I walked over to the bathroom and started the water. He was standing in front of me with his shirt completely unbuttoned. I looked up at his face and he smiled. He was going to get me to play again tonight, after all. I thought I understood that. He was thinking about me as I was thinking about him in his hotel room. I reached out and stroked him through his pants as his hand rubbed my cock through my dress.</p> <p>My hand found the zipper of his fly and my finger easily slipped inside his pants. I pulled it out and his hand automatically went to my cock. He groaned as he felt it. He started to stroke me, slowly and carefully as I was slowly rubbing his cock. His hand slipped back to my cock and squeezed it gently. I groaned again, louder this time. He leaned to kiss me, and I quickly felt his hand on the back of my head.</p> <p>He pushed me so that I was almost laying on the bathroom floor. He reached under me, and I thought it might be about time for a condom. He wanted to take his time, though. As he slid his pants to his ankles and kicked off his shoes, I moved in to get the condom from his pants.</p> <p>He quickly reached in a pocket and pulled something from it. I watched as he opened a foil and ripped it open. I watched as he wrapped it around himself.</p> <p>"Are you going to suck or fuck me?" he asked me. "Can I fuck you first?"</p> <p>"Well.... It's hard to say... I haven't done this to you."</p> <p>"Mmm... OK. I think you won me out... But just keep your head where it is. Okay?"</p> <p>I thought maybe "keep my head down" was something he had heard. He reached past me to retrieve the condom off the floor. I reached for his hand, but his body moved up the wall, and he stepped away from me. I could not say anything. I was about to say something, maybe to get him to take his pants down and fuck me, and then I did not have the words. I watched as he put the end of the condom at the tip of his cock and slowly slid it in. I could tell by his sigh that he had done this before when he slowly pulled it out. I watched as he repeated the action, slowly sliding the condom further in.</p> <p>His cock now in my mouth seemed to have a mind of its own. I could tell he was loving the feel of it. He put his hands on my head, and started to push my mouth down his cock. It took only a moment for him to put the condom on and sit down next me on the toilet in the bathroom.</p> <p>He took a condom out of the fly. He put it on and started a rhythm of fucking me. I could tell because of the size. He thrust and fucked me in the bathroom. He wanted me to know how he felt. But he wanted to do it with me. I heard him groan deeply and I did feel him start to climax. At the first thrust, I didn't want to feel him get hard, so I pushed him off me.</p> <p>I had not expected him to take another shower in the morning, but he had his shower and dried me off. He led me into the bedroom and lay me on my back on the bed. He then took several of the items from my dresser to my bed, and put them around. He took care of my panties and my dress, as well as my stockings and my shoes. When he climbed out of his clothes, and then got back into bed with me, we lay there for a long time.</p> <p>I could tell he was a little nervous in getting undressed. When he climbed on top of me, he was not so easy to undress me - not that I am a slut. When I was naked, the moment he began to roll the condom onto his long cock, I asked himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
