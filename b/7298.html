She asked me with her hand around my cock. "I am not about to let you leave it here. Besides, I have a proposition for you," she added.</p> <p>"Sure, what's that?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I really wouldn't say anything unless you were willing to do it, but I would like you to see it again. I didn't put it in the contract before I left for lunch. It is quite a large one," she said.</p> <p>This was it. Here I was, naked with a woman I had just met a few hours ago, naked with my cock in her hand, and there she was getting naked with me too.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. I hadn't been completely naked in front of some other woman in almost a decade. I would have had sex with them then and there if we hadn't been married. And there was a lot of good to come out of this.</p> <p>I took a deep breath and set the phone down, then picked it up again. As I sat back down, it took a little of my control I was using at this point to hold a conversation.</p> <p>But first, I had to find out exactly what was in her mind, and how much. But first, I had to talk with her.</p> <p>"You know it was a mistake. I couldn't help myself. As soon as I had your picture that night I was all over you. I couldn't stop looking at you. For one thing, my hands were all over you. It was a sin to be alone with you in your own home. But it was also a sin to have one of the very best parts of you seen in all your glory. Especially when you had me all over you. And I couldn't help staring at the parts where you had me inside you." she said.</p> <p>I was still sitting there with this strange new information. She was right. I could have done things that were even more disgusting. There was no turning back. I wanted to feel her hands again. So I asked, "What does this have to do with me?"</p> <p>"It doesn't have to work. It's just the opposite in some ways. You may be married but we can still get naked together," she said, in just the same tone she had used the first time.</p> <p>I looked at her in shock. I hadn't expected such an invitation. I still thought of the time I thought we would have sex on my bed. She made it seem quite serious. A look of shame came over her eyes, which were also a very attractive shade of pink.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered, "It would be alright! If you are interested. If it would be really nice."</p> <p>She lifted her lips to mine again. And this time when she opened them there was no need for a kiss. So, our tongues dueled, explored each others bodies. Finally, I just sat there watching her. She smiled and then said, "I'm sure we can find a way to get naked together," with a look of excitement on her face.</p> <p>I knew that I had to say what I had to, because she gave me an answer to that. She had no intention of leaving this.</p> <p>Her smile changed to a serious look once her eyes left mine and went back to looking at me. And then she reached down to lightly touched my cock, which once again got a hard-on. I couldn't help it. So, she leaned over, putting her cheek next to mine, and kissed me again. Her lips lingered a bit, then parted. In answer to my offer, she took my hand and put it behind her head, pulling my face into her mouth with me. The kiss was brief. She pulled her lips slowly back, then pushed them back, then looked straight into my eyes. She did something that I don't think any woman had ever done, put her lips back on mine. The kiss felt wonderful.</p> <p>Then, her hand moved along my cock, rubbing her hand along it, then she moved it up to stroke my balls. My cock was so fucking hard by that time. When she leaned forward to give me another soft smile, I grabbed her nipple between two fingers and started rolling it as her hands were playing with my balls.</p> <p>She stopped kissing me, and then pulled me by my hands away from the sofa so she could stand. Her legs were spread, and her lips moved along my chest. She looked up at me, and said, "I have been a bad girl, not saying it to you yet," she said as she put her hands on my shoulders and rolled me toward her.</p> <p>She pressed her lips against mine and slowly kissed me while caressingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
