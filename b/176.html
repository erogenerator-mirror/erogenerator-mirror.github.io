It worked out in the end, so we settled for a little more light. We got to my room and the lights were turned down. Our friends had both gone.</p> <p>The light at my head was turned off and I turned to look at Sharon, she too was looking over at me.</p> <p>"You know," I said. "It's not too late to do what you do, but if you don't like it, just tell me."</p> <p>"I guess so," she said. "It was the one time. I guess it was a bit different, you know? I do not know for sure. It might be a little weird for me."</p> <p>"It doesn't have to be weird for you, just remember," I said. "It isn't cheating. If there's another guy, it's not cheating. If you think they had sex with another guy, you should never act on such a thought. Besides, if they did, I guess they should feel guilty about it. It doesn't have to be that hard. They could do that anytime," I warned her.</p> <p>"I think that if I told you about this, it wouldn't be so hard for you and I to do things for ourselves," she said.</p> <p>"We could just talk about it," I told her. She didn't really say anything. I figured that we would have enough time to be friends before school started again in a couple of weeks. I thought back to the one time I was talking to Sharon in the park. She was still in love with a guy.</p> <p>"What about you?" I asked her, "or maybe you could get your boyfriend involved in this too? You think we could help each other out?" "Yeah," she said, "it may be weird with you and your girlfriend to see this, but I think we could be more in each other's company."</p> <p>We spent the next six months sharing my bed and sleeping in the same bed.</p> <p>One afternoon we had the door all open and when the bell rang I yelled, "Sharon, do you want to come in? You look as if you are ready for some sex. Go ahead in and sit down."</p> <p>Sharon came in and sat down at the base of the bed, "You aren't coming in, are you?"</p> <p>"I am not," she said. "I was too wrapped up in my work to be able to walk in, so I will not be able to come up soon," she told me. Before I could answer she said, "That would be great but we really do have to go on some work. We've been together for years just talking about us. We might meet up for a while and just talk about stuff."</p> <p>I just smiled. I know that the first time I did anything was with Sharon again and that's what I wanted to do.</p> <p>After two weeks of the same, the lights came up.</p> <p>The one thing that I wasn't expecting was coming home. Sharon got a very nice looking car and we were driving to the airport, as I was planning on going to class. She was wearing a very sexy pair of jeans over black high heels. Her blouse had a thin line in it showing that there wasn't much to it either.</p> <p>"Are you going to let me come with you?" I asked her.</p> <p>All she did was nod. We got on the way to the airport and I started to get worried. We walked a few steps down the runway and suddenly stopped. I heard her say, "You are right, don't you know?"</p> <p>"I am just not sure right now either," I told her. "It really is about getting back on some good behavior, don't you think?"</p> <p>"Well," she said, "if I had one choice, I guess I could go with you."</p> <p>"Well," I replied, "you have that choice and you'll have to make your own decision about what you are comfortable with or not."</p> <p>She laughed, "That was funny," she said, "I have no interest in getting back together with you and what I did with you was kind of weird. Can you do that? Just you and me?"</p> <p>"I know it is crazy, but it is what it is," I said, "and even if I did want to, I would not even think about it, not as that."</p> <p>"It's just I am not doing everything I want to," she said.</p> <p>"What are you doing, and why?" I asked. She thought for a minute, "Well, you can leave it alone. I think what we did when we got home was really hot."</p> <p>"Oh, come on," she said, almost pleading, "and I don't knowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
