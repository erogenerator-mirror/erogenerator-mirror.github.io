I really didn't mean to slap you again!" he said after a short time. "Don't get defensive. It was a accident!"</p> <p>"I didn't see, nor did I feel anything," I replied smiling at him.</p> <p>"Good, and what's better: I'm sorry you felt your skin against mine when you were crying. Remember, when I was slapping you to give myself a better angle I could get my knee back under you and smack the bottom of your ass. Don't get defensive." I was smiling thinking that the punishment was not so bad after all.</p> <p>"I'm going to have to think about it again. That's why I was so happy today, and that's why I got out of your bed before midnight. If you want to call it quits we won't be able to go on any more with that thing, but I need to be out of here by noon at the latest."</p> <p>"Yeah. I'm going to have to think about it again, but not until I think about it. That was the hardest thing for me since I'm new to being in a relationship. I didn't want a relationship based on sex, but in a relationship it was good, and since it doesn't exist in my personal life at the moment just let it happen," I chuckled. "I'm not going to argue with you about it or anything else while I'm out of this bed, but you probably better not try trying to make me feel better now."</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe I'll take that as a compliment just to make me feel better if I feel like it," I said, and he was going to agree on that.</p> <p>"Maybe we should hang out some more. We could have lunch and get to know one another a little better," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah," I agreed. "I think that's probably true. Maybe we can do that some time."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," he replied. This time was going to be different, but it was going to be much more fun than before. I didn't understand why, even with him saying things like those, but it seemed like things could come to a head again.</p> <p>As I was leaving to pick up my things he asked, "Where's my cell phone please?"</p> <p>I thought to myself that I just wanted to see if I actually knew how to find my phone.</p> <p>Once I got my things set up I went into the back bathroom to start the shower. As I started the water I looked up and saw that Tim was still there, his head was on my breasts and his arm draped over my stomach. He had one thigh on the shower stall facing me while he cupped my breast with his other hand and softly played with my nipple. It was starting to get a little chilly in the shower and I took my time rubbing my body down to the point where I felt so naughty being naked while his eyes played with me. I wanted nothing more than to take the moment of intimacy and be naked in front of him. I took one of Tim's hands and put it on one of my breasts. He pulled my nipple upward and gently squeezed it in his hand.</p> <p>I could tell by the way he was massaging my hard nipple that he was getting quite excited and wanted to feel me, but he hadn't taken his hand off of my breast. I looked down my body to see my pubic mound on display, and my hard nub peeking out from under it. Then I noticed his hand in the shower. It wasn't really his hand, but his fingers and thumb were almost entirely covered in my fluid. As I watched he took his middle finger and put it over my clit and started to rub it a little, and I could tell that he was making me feel good. He then slipped his finger back down to take my clit in his mouth while he played with my nipple.</p> <p>That was a wonderful feeling. I had never felt a man do that to me before, even in a porn film. I closed my eyes and enjoyed every second of it. I didn't want to stop it when I felt like I wouldn't be able to if I did. I could feel my orgasm building and just as I was about to cum he stopped and turned me around to face the shower wall. He lifted my leg up and spread it on the shower nozzle on both sides at right angles to me. His hand joined my other when he started to go down and rub my pussy lips. I wasn't going to have any climax that day, and the feel of his hand was something I couldn't describe. It felt like a finger and the feel of the soap just made it a totally different feeling.</p> <p>While we were taking turns rubbing my clitoris until I came all over his hand and fingers. I don't know what it is, but it feels really goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
