It's just an over the top reaction. I really need to look away from it all so I can just relax."</p> <p>"Are you okay?" he asked.</p> <p>"Okay. I'm sorry. It's just a bit overwhelming but I really need to look away. I don't want to do anything to mess up the new you."</p> <p>"It's fine and there's nothing to worry about. All I need now is for you to relax and just enjoy your time with the gorgeous young woman beside you. Now, lets get back to the dinner."</p> <p>She got up from the couch and went over to John, who was still sitting there and gave him a hard look.</p> <p>She stood up, walked over to him and kissed him hard on the lips with some force that caused his heart to skip a beat. As she stood up he noticed how attractive she looked. Her beautiful tan skin looked smooth and smooth. With her small but perky breasts pushing against him, his dick started coming to life in its eagerness. She had a gorgeous face. Not a full, round, heart-shaped face but instead a gorgeous face with perfect lines above and below her cute, slightly upturned eyes. Her lips were plump and soft under his, but they were perfect. He could already feel a bulge starting to rise in his pants and he just gave her a little smile.</p> <p>"Don't move," she whispered and began to kiss him again, lightly running her tongue over his as he ran his hand up and down her side.</p> <p>"You smell wonderful, baby."</p> <p>"Holly, sweetie, my lips are still wet from kissing you. You haven't tasted as good as you look."</p> <p>They both blushed as their lips met and were quickly replaced with passion. Their kisses heated their bodies up. John began to move his lips down her neck, starting with her collar bone, down her shirt, and past her breasts. As he got to the buttons and the undershirt, his hand shot up to rub her bellybutton. She began to undo his shirt as she moaned in his ear. With his shirt completely unbuttoned, she pushed him back and began to unfasten his jeans, his cock sprung out to take it in hand and stroke it slowly along that very large, hard shaft. John had to control himself, this is his girl, but he couldn't take his eyes off her naked breasts. She was beautiful.</p> <p>"I've wanted you all night," she said in a breathy whisper, as her hand continued to stroke him, "I've been waiting."</p> <p>"I've wanted you as well, Holly."</p> <p>"Are we going to take our time with dinner? I want that cock of yours deep inside of me tonight."</p> <p>"That sounds great!" he said. He stood up and took her hand, leading her over to the couch.</p> <p>"Would you like something cold to drink?</p> <p>"Yes, that would be nice."</p> <p>He sat her down on the edge of the couch and sat on the other. He pulled her sweater up over her head and began to kiss down her left shoulder, down to her ribs, kissing and licking up to her right shoulder. Her hand was now on his head, lightly tracing his blond hair with her fingers. John pushed her bra down with his hands.</p> <p>"I'm so ready for that."</p> <p>"I bet you are. What's wrong with your hand, Holly?"</p> <p>"No, not just any hand."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"No, not just any hand," she whispered. "You have a fantastic cock that will please any woman tonight."</p> <p>"I just hope it will make you happy tonight."</p> <p>"I just hoped not. I've been waiting for the right time," she said.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm aching for you to take that big thing in you now."</p> <p>She smiled, reached up and quickly unzipped his pants and pulled them down around his ankles. John pulled the waistband of her panties aside and began to stroke her. As his cock emerged out of the hole in his boxers, she began to stroke him, running her fingertips over the sensitive head.</p> <p>"I'm still in the mood, lover."</p> <p>She smiled and kissed him on the mouth, then, pulling off her own panties, put his cock into her. She pushed herself down and took him all the way in.
