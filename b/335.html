I turned my eyes away after my gaze drifted from his face. "I am sorry about the way things went."</p> <p>"Oh, of course you are, Miss. I understand the importance of this meeting."</p> <p>"But after the last one. . . I don't think I can keep going any longer. I am sorry."</p> <p>"I'm not surprised, Miss. And please, if you want me to leave, we can continue," and with that he stepped back and began to exit from the room.</p> <p>"Please, call me Mary." He waved dismissively and turned to leave, but when he looked back at me I swear I could feel myself blush. Just then he was out of sight and I tried to make a dash for that door to escape before he saw me. As I hurried to my room I turned to the wall mirror and noticed that my hair had come loose, falling in ripples down through my shoulders. As the cold air entered my face I looked at the thin straps, knowing the material of my night dress was clinging to my skin. I smiled and touched with hands that had been so deft with the ties and deftly undid the knot. With the tie loose I pushed the dress down below my breasts. I was glad that we had only been in the dark, when I turned the corner as I reached for the zipper and slid it down. "No," I admonished myself. I had to do it this way. I wanted the nightdress so much as I had always wanted the evening gown and when I wanted to wear it I could tell it.</p> <p>I quickly found my way back in the room. I was naked within the space of a few seconds and I turned a complete 180 degrees to face my husband as I dropped the dress on the floor to reveal what I had become. With the dress removed I looked at my naked body in the mirror. The soft light of the room bathed my nipples and the rest of my breasts, making them feel as though I were on fire. What surprised me were the small, delicate little pink nubs of my breasts and I felt so vulnerable in them like two ripe cherries. The thin fabric of my corset caught my breasts in a way that seemed to leave just enough light from the light on my dress's wall to show that they were even smaller than they had been previously. I knew that these small breasts, as they were not much fuller than the rest of me, might not be enough to conceal all my charms. In fact, they looked more like ripe cherries than the pale white flesh that was mine, in spite of the small size. It was very erotic and when faced with my situation I tried to keep my thighs as close together as possible to hide them without being seen and to hide my sex from everyone's eyes. It was difficult however; I had to keep looking at myself with my face just above the mirror. As I did so I let my eyes caress in all its glorious symmetry, seeing the most beautiful sight I could ever imagine. One thing that was missing was the tiny little brown triangles covering my nipples and the most lovely spot just below my breasts that hid my clitoris. But today was a special day. I decided to try and see if I could somehow get a glimpse of my breasts in the mirror without being seen. The idea seemed to be for my husband.</p> <p>"I saw the light in the room and realized the effect I had on you." My husband's words brought a grin to my face. "But I wasn't thinking of anything I could do to hurt you, dear. I was so looking forward to see you again. I can't think of anyone more attractive than you. But I could almost forget that you were naked right in front of me." I was already almost in tears of the pleasure I suddenly felt as I looked into that mirror. I closed my eyes, leaned against the mirror, and let the feeling wash over me.</p> <p>I was so turned on that it took only a little more to bring me to my first orgasm and I was very close now of course. I reached out to touch my breasts and I pulled my fingers from my body to grasp hold and rub my nipples between my fingers. Both sensations simultaneously sent shudders of pleasure through my body. As the tremors weakened I became aware of my own nakedness. My husband saw my breasts; how naked they were and wondered if I had ever actually shed the clothing that I was wearing so that there were no barriers between them, as his gaze roamed about my body, as more of my skin was exposed with every caress. I wondered about what my husband had in mind for his meeting today.</p> <p>"Oh, Miss, are you all right?" His eyes had dropped but I could see he saw my breasts as well, my nipples like that little bullets, pressing against my thin corsetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
