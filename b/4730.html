I won't let anyone hurt your back...please."</p> <p>With one last squeeze of her ass he pulled her over onto her back. Her long wavy blond hair fluttered around her face, as he sat up at his own height. His hands caressed her, her soft blonde curls, her soft smooth skin, as she rested her head on one elbow, her right thigh straddling his. He kissed her long and deep, the taste of her sweet pussy on his lips, as he moved his head down to her breast. His mouth began to suck and lick her nipple, as he began to slide his right hand up her abdomen.</p> <p>"Oh, baby...you taste so good...sooooo much."</p> <p>The last thing she heard was the soft but deep, sensuous, erotic sound of a satisfied moan emanating from deep within her belly. It made her feel so deliciously decadent. As her soft little body began to tense and shiver with every touch of his wet fingers to both breast, she let her eyes open to him. She gazed down at him, and he smiled back at her. Reaching down, he took the tube of lubricant on his left hand, and brought it to her open and ready mouth. He looked at her as she sat up on the bed, her arms holding herself wide to him. Her arms went around his neck and pulled him down close to her, as they kissed passionately.</p> <p>After a few moments they stopped the kiss to gaze in each other's eyes as he slowly slid forward, and began to run his forefinger over her ass. She moaned softly as he slid the finger gently over her pussy, and pressed it against her lips. She was wet already, it didn't take more than a few seconds for him to slide her soaked finger into her.</p> <p>"God...I love it when you do that..." He said huskily as he slid his finger all the way into her. "So sweet...it makes me feel so good."</p> <p>As he slid his hand down to her thighs to hold her just as she had been, she slowly slid down, resting her body on top of him, holding her arms tight in the air. He had her spread wide to either side of him, but he didn't bother as she began to kiss his chest and belly. Her hands slowly ran their fingers up and down the length of his shaft as she ran her lips up and down him, her tongue licking his hairy chest. It took her breath away when her hand squeezed and massaged his balls through the thin material of his shorts.</p> <p>She couldn't believe how turned on she was as she felt his dick begin to grow inside her hand. She felt a tingling, as his eyes closed and he began to moan softly. She slid her hand down the entire length, as she slid it over his head. She knew he must be leaking precum now, which made it easy to slide her hand all over his length in between her soft lips. She slid her lips the length of his cock as she slid her mouth over his head, closing her eyes. There was no hiding her moans; they were soft and sensual. She felt like she was going to cum immediately, every little movement and stroke from his hands sent her over the edge. As he gently slid his hips in and out, she pushed his shorts out, causing them to slide off his cock in front of her. She felt light headed as she stood up.</p> <p>"Do you have any condoms?" She heard him ask her.</p> <p>"I took a nice big one on my trip, I'm on the pill...no...I hope you don't think I don't get to wear them, please, baby," she said, with a smile. He smiled back at her as he pulled his hand away from her.</p> <p>"Of course we don't use them. But I have some good, homemade ones in my bedside table. Take a look, sweetie, have some fun."</p> <p>He looked at her still sitting there, her eyes glowing in the semi light, her mouth slightly agape. He saw her face and mouth, but could not make out all of it. Her eyes were twinkling again as she pulled his shorts down, exposing his huge, throbbing thing.</p> <p>Once he was naked, he held out the condom. "Do you need this to use for you, or do you want to get yourself in a hurry?" he asked her.</p> <p>She looked down at her hand holding the rubber, as she took it from her and rolled it down. "I'm too excited, it's already wet, so I don't think that'll be too much. Besides, you'll find something else to use...don't worry."</p> <p>He stepped closer to her, now fully nude except for his shirt and shortsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
