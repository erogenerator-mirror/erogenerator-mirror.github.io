But at this moment, this was the best sexual experience of my entire life. I'm not even saying that I actually want to. Or that I'd do such a thing.</p> <p>We arrived, and as it turned out a very good hotel. I had ordered a king sized bed, and this room was even as good as my best friend's. I had decided I'd have one for myself at least. But I wanted to give Ben an excellent first impression. This was my first time.</p> <p>As we entered the room, Ben was already taking her in his arms. She had her arms firmly around his neck. As far as he could tell, his mouth was buried deeply in her ear. I could see her entire body quaking with anticipation. His hands had once again found their way over her body. I heard her inhale sharply with anticipation of what was to come.</p> <p>We were in our early twenties, and although we all knew this was going to be a night of firsts, we felt very young and vulnerable. We never, I hope, had our fantasies made that explicit. We never discussed what we actually wanted.</p> <p>Instead, as both of us started to undress, we stripped off our clothes. Ben was in the process of undoing my shirt and when I removed hers. I'd never done anything half as erotic. But we both were in the process of unbuttoning each other's shirts, and now they were both fully removed. We had a full view of ourselves to see ourselves, and then I stripped completely nude.</p> <p>I pulled my own shirt off, and as I did, I began to undo her bra, and she was soon naked. I dropped my briefs to the floor and she stepped out of the garment onto the bed. We were both completely naked for each other.</p> <p>As I pulled off her shorts, I could see that her pussy was completely shaved. We had always known our bodies and each of us were very touchable and erotic in our private ways. Now, we were totally naked, standing fully in the center of the king-sized bed. Our bodies were touching, and the sight of our bodies together was bringing our lust to a new level. As her hands touched the outside of our bodies, I knew that she had very aroused by the way she was stroking my cock, and that was pushing the limits of my control. I knew I had to be bold as I pushed her back, and took off my shirt then my shorts. I got a good grip on her hips and pulled her back to me. She reached down to help me in and out, as I reached for her and grabbed her firmly by the ass.</p> <p>I pressed my hardness towards her. She looked disappointed, but opened them to welcome it. My hand moved down onto her body. As my index finger slid slowly over her outer lips, she was so wet, and it only took a moment for me to work her in an obvious way.</p> <p>"Please", she breathed, "don't stop". So I slowly eased my finger inside. She closed her eyes and arched into me as I withdrew it again, and then pushed it in again. Her lips were soft and soft. I could almost feel how her body made his finger go in and out. She was taking in more and more of it each time.</p> <p>I moved my finger out until I could get it to come out fully. I held it there a moment, looking into her eyes for just a brief moment. I could see her eyes half closed with ecstasy. Her head was turning in my direction as I moved it up and down slowly as I removed myself from her. I moved my mouth to hers a long moment, and she reached out to touch my face.</p> <p>"Wow", she exhaled. "That was amazing", and I felt her hand reach out to touch my cheek.</p> <p>"I love you, Amanda", I said as I pulled her down to me. She held onto my face as she looked into my eyes. At that moment, I was ready to surrender to my wildest fantasy. I wanted her to experience what she just experienced.</p> <p>"I love you", she whispered as she kissed me again on the cheek. I could taste the saltiness of her lips on my face. But she continued kissing me the entire time we were kissing, and even broke it off to say, "That was awesome."</p> <p>"I knew you would", I said as I kissed her lips again. "You are fantastic. I want you to make me feel like no woman has ever made me feel."</p> <p>"That's great", she answered as she pulled the other side of my body towards her. Then both our mouths met once again at the same time. As soon as her lips finally parted, they were again locked with mine as she slowly slid them down myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
