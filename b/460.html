Have you?"</p> <p>"No. I mean, yes, but not in the way I would have hoped."</p> <p>And this time it was the guy from the club I remembered coming over. He was very nice looking, very dark, quite tall - and rather short.</p> <p>I remember thinking to myself that if this was the right man, there'd be no chance of getting out of this hotel alive. And to be honest; if I gave him my address and gave him directions; my whole body would immediately respond instantly.</p> <p>I was beginning to get into the role and really like this guy. I was already wondering how I could start making a complete transformation from the shy old guy the minute this guy knocked on my door.</p> <p>We both finished our drink and I went to get out of the bar. As soon as I got to the main part of the bar my heart fell into my stomach while I saw this tall man approach the bartender.</p> <p>"Excuse me, sir?" it took me a moment for my mind to register this voice: it was the voice of a very attractive twenty-something. "May I get you a refill on your brandy?"</p> <p>As the bartender got me a full glass he said, "I'm very sorry about your friend coming along. I was in a hurry to leave."</p> <p>Even in a drunken state the way he spoke made me think how attractive he'd been while we'd been in the bar.</p> <p>I don't remember what I said to him or what his reply could have been, but I know that this guy obviously liked what he saw in my eyes. I was instantly attracted to him and he looked so cute and sexy; I couldn't wait to start a relationship with him.</p> <p>Suddenly I turned and made my way back to my room. As I unlocked the door and made my way into my bedroom, I suddenly fell into bed. It was already dawn and I was still too buzzed to make much progress as I just wanted to stay like that for a while.</p> <p>I must have dozed off for a moment because as I opened my eyes I got an even better idea of the day.</p> <p>It was early in the morning and I was still in bed, so I knew I had a lot to do.</p> <p>I put on a light night-dress and went downstairs to the kitchen. There was coffee on the stove for when I looked up when I saw that somebody was sitting out there.</p> <p>"I believe I'm at your house," said the tall stranger. "Do you want a coffee, Sir?"</p> <p>My immediate reaction was to shake my head no to him. But I was getting tired of his condescending manner and I told him no.</p> <p>We chatted a bit, but before long we were both talking about his name. Then we talked about our previous nights at the club and the date he'd had with 'Auntie' and we began to work out our schedules to catch up on the time we'd had for each of them.</p> <p>By lunchtime we were up in the second floor bedroom of our master suite - which was by now the size of the house. By the time we were done, I knew immediately that the night ahead was going to be a very interesting one. That thought caused the first thing that popped into my head was, "May I take off my clothes while you get yourself undressed?" I was completely unprepared for the reply and, almost as if he sensed my hesitation, the stranger said, "We'd go on a date, Sir."</p> <p>It was the first time I'd been addressed by myself in a sexual way and immediately regretted it. The thought of him knowing he was now about to be undressed made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. But then the realisation of what was happening suddenly hit me and I felt as if I knew that my whole life had changed for the better in a few hours or more.</p> <p>I made my way quickly down the flight of stairs to my bedroom and started to strip the clothes out of my wetsuit. When I pulled them from the hamper I could see the look in his eyes - I'm sure he loved what he saw. I got onto the bed and, with my knees spread wide, took each of the boy's hands and placed them at their waist. Then I moved my hands down between my thighs again and spread them apart so that my feet were pointing straight towards the ceiling.</p> <p>I then got on the bed on my hands and knees and raised my ass up in the air. He didn't need any directions from me other than I did it, but I wasn't so sure that I had the nerve to do so. It was clear from the way he didn't need any directions.</p> <p>"Please, Sir. Please, may I put in my fingersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
