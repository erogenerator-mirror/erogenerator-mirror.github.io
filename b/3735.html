She spread my legs as I was about to take off my shoes, and pushed them and I off to each side of me. She slowly knelt between my legs and looked straight into my eyes.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh god yes."</p> <p>When I was only half naked she moved back a bit, and pushed her hips forward. "Slow" was all she said, and moved a bit further, her hips barely touching my hips. Her hands started to move up and down my chest, and she seemed to move much more than she had before, and I was amazed that I hadn't been in a state like this before...</p> <p>"Oh God yes, yes, yes"</p> <p>She moved so that her pussy was right at my mouth, not just teasing, and I was surprised that she moved her body with it. I licked and she thrust her hips into me.</p> <p>In a very gentle way she asked me if I wanted her to cum. I looked into her eyes as she looked into mine and she nodded. I was so close, but she moved her body against me and I could feel her pussy hard against my lips, then she pulled away and I felt so empty. She moved forward, and with both hands pushed my shoulders down. I slid down the bed and I landed on my side, and as I looked down I could see that she was leaning over me on top of me, her pussy pressing against my cock.</p> <p>"Are you ready for more?" she asked.</p> <p>Oh god yes, I was close to cumming, but she pushed me down again. I opened my eyes and her eyes were closed. Suddenly, her body was over mine, and my cock was at her entrance. She slowly pushed back, and the head slid in. There were no words, just a soft moan as she pulled back.</p> <p>Then she pushed back again and I could feel myself stretching. Her legs wrapped themselves around mine and both of us gasped as we slid together. Her hands held me against her, and I could not move any more. Her pussy was soft inside, warm and soft and so tight. I could feel and see that she was wet, and it felt so good. Her hands slipped up and down my arms, and pulled me in harder. I reached up and took her breasts, caressing the soft skin, my thumbs rubbing and teasing her nipples. Her hands came down and held me so tight, and I reached up and put her hands over mine, and pulled them downward, spreading them. I started to slide in and out slowly, and she was breathing hard. I could almost picture her tits and her pussy like this, and then I started to fuck her. Each thrust was like pushing into a warm, wet, wonderful place. She moved, and I moved back, and she grabbed my cock, and moved me faster.</p> <p>Our orgasms were just starting, and I moaned into her neck. She pushed back my lips and kissed me hard. We both stopped, just for a moment. I could feel her lips on mine, and tasted myself on her mouth, and we could not breathe too hard. She finally came back and put herself on top of me, her body against mine, holding me tightly. I could do nothing but hold her, and kiss her. Our tongues danced and probed together, and when we came, we were still, just holding each other. I was so happy that we were still together...</p> <p>She said I was to wake her in an hour. Then she got up and took my hands and lifted me into the showerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
