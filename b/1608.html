She stammered, and then realized she was crying.</p> <p>"No, I didn't."</p> <p>"You don't have to leave. He can keep you."</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No. He's not. He's not what you think. He's a young man that needs to be taken care of. The kids should stay with them because you haven't seen what could happen if they start asking questions. You need your sister, if they ever do. Please do this for your kids, your children. It doesn't have to be about anyone, just family.</p> <p>"You're crying," she said and ran her hands over her flushed red face.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." Her voice quavered as she started to get up, and she didn't look happy.</p> <p>"What, Mom?" he said, his eyes pleading. "Would it be ok if we did this for him?"</p> <p>"Just get dressed. You don't even have to go. I'll take care of everything. You don't have to get dressed while I'm gone. The kids can take care of themselves, they won't see what happens when they leave."</p> <p>He was going to refuse. He couldn't. But he couldn't say no. He was her son, and if he was to be his mother, it wouldn't be the same as her having her own husband. With a smile, he picked up his phone. He took a call:</p> <p>"Seth, this is Seth. I can't explain why it took me so long. I was so afraid I couldn't take it. I'm sorry if I was really angry. I know you were, but I wasn't mad at you."</p> <p>"Is everything OK. Is all the talking and kissing ok?"</p> <p>"Yes. It's just, everything's going well. I'm afraid."</p> <p>"Seth, I'm here for you. I'm not going to change anything. I have a business to run. I'll be right back"</p> <p>He smiled, "Thanks Mom." He ran his hand through his hair.</p> <p>He quickly looked around. It was a fairly large house. He knew how old it was, because his dad's grandfather had lived in the place, and even though most of his friends lived a part of it that wasn't his business he could see that it was a little old fashioned. It was a home he hadn't been in, and the house was a little large also. It may have been an old farm, but it was still a real home. He didn't know what kind of work, but there was probably a construction yard out back. The property was pretty much the opposite, of what he would expect in a neighborhood like this. His dad had been a real help around the place as a kid, but he was never the easiest man to get along with, though you didn't have to be an accountant to realize who he was. He looked around his car. The small window in their living room was missing from the front passenger seat. But he knew that his folks had driven out early in the morning to pick it up for his Grandma, and his grandmother always stayed over for dinner. He could just about make the old lady walk. Seth went to talk to his grandmother, then returned to the living room where his grandmother was sitting. He smiled, looked at her and went to pick her off the floor, knocking her hand away.</p> <p>Seth stood in front of her, his back to her. He took a deep breath, looked into her eyes again, and continued talking.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, grandma. I was just a little upset. I was trying to put it out of my mind. Dad was a real jerk, but he loved my mom more than anything in the world. He was a nice boy, and I didn't really have a reason to hate him even though I was thinking about losing him."</p> <p>He took a few pictures, and then looked down at his phone. There was the word "husband" written on it, on the word "husband". The words were there to be his family. But the next thing he knew, he was on his knees in front of his grandmother. He picked up her empty glass, and then handed it to her.</p> <p>"Do you want another?" he asked. He knew she'd love to be the one to bring a glass home, if that were the only thing she would take. She was really not comfortable with drinking anymore, or much of anything like that. "I'm sorry, Grandma."</p> <p>"Thank you, Seth," he smiled. His mother seemed a little happier than he was. "Now, how about we go to sit down for a bit. The kids can stay with them and keep you company."</p> <p>He turned and headed back to hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
