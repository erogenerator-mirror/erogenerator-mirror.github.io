"With all of the things I am now..." He'd been cut off from whatever he was saying, only to feel another hand wrapping around his cock, this time more firmly stroking through his clothes.</p> <p>The man's hands kept working his trousers up but not zipping them down. It felt like ages later when his knickers were pulled down enough that there was nothing left but a pair of soft feminine lips working over the head of his cock. Even there in the darkness there seemed to be someone there with a whole lot of feelings to which they could not explain. But even as the man was trying to explain, it was not only his penis that was being worshipped; there was more of his hands holding his head; his mouth; his neck; his shoulder. And when the other hand continued to rub its way up and down his cock, a pair of slim fingers would part his foreskin, drawing out a strand of his silvery-white skin and sliding between them before sliding back down again. He couldn't help himself even as he felt the pressure of his hand being removed from between his legs.</p> <p>The other hand was moving back to the back of his neck, gripping a firm, warm handful of a soft, smooth neck. It was all that was holding him still now; the heat; the softness. "Oh," he'd gasped, his knees moving slightly to help the man move so that he was being pressed even harder into him. It wasn't an easy passage for his legs to take and as he felt the other hand starting again, this time stroking the cheeks of his bum he knew he was going to cum very soon.</p> <p>The heat and the smell of him, the man's smell, it was all too much for him.</p> <p>"Oh," he'd said again as the man's hand came down again, this time, holding him still until he was almost out of his mind with the last vestiges of his orgasm.</p> <p>The man's hand seemed to have released his cock in time as quickly as it had moved, though it seemed to be as though the second hand had simply released his neck, and it left him without a word. He didn't have time to be sure but he was not disappointed when they left him hanging there for a few seconds before both him and the man came round to his side once more, both of them stroking his cock as though they would never tire of the sight of him. The man grinned for a moment and then looked around as if waiting for his next instruction.</p> <p>"I think we need to go now," the man said. "There is obviously another room where we can use." His voice had now become a little cold, almost too deep for words though there was no mistaking that.</p> <p>The man nodded to the first man. The look on the face of the man was one of sadness, sadness that seemed to be mixed with something that seemed to be a mixture of hurt pain and a little disappointment. They both smiled at one another for a moment, though it was not as though they had really understood one another.</p> <p>"It's done," they said. "There's only one door."</p> <p>The man looked at the door. "Wait, please, let's go."</p> <p>That was his own voice. He was looking at it for a long moment.</p> <p>"Do what you have to," he said. He turned and strode out.</p> <p>The man followed a little faster than the first man had. "It's too dangerous," he said. "Do not come, let's go."</p> <p>The two of them led the way down the corridor. Once they were behind the guard's head, the two men took hold of him gently as they lead him to the first door on the left.</p> <p>At the front of the hallway they turned. The one they had just knocked opened the door.</p> <p>"Oh," the man had said once more. "I had been wondering, I think," he said. "I have a special man here."</p> <p>The man shook his head, smiling. "Oh I didn't know," he said. "No, I don't think you should be asking," he said. "But I guess, as I have said before, we probably ought to take someone in. Maybe a woman perhaps."</p> <p>"Oh," the man said. "Oh."</p> <p>"Come here," the man said to the other. The three men then took hold of the man roughly, they took his arm and led him from the room out onto the street.</p> <p>Two of the men followed him and once again they took the man's hand.</p> <p>"And one of us," one of them told the other. "We will take him.
