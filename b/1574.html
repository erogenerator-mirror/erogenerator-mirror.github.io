You tell me to keep kissing you.</p> <p>We both feel so vulnerable and so helpless.</p> <p>I turn my body around and you place yourself near to me.</p> <p>My breasts are full and rounded, and jiggle as I move back against you. Your hand goes to my breast and caresses it. It feels so good. You caress my breasts, massaging them as your finger plays with my clit again. I moan softly and feel like I'm going to cum right here. You can feel how much I want you.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," you whisper in my ear.</p> <p>You kiss me hard again, and pull my panties to the side. Then you slide your tongue into my mouth and we French kiss. You roll to your back and place one leg over my leg as you pull me into a 69 on top of you.</p> <p>You take a small vibrating egg from your pocket. I want you so much.</p> <p>You lick and suck on me as the egg slips inside me. It feels wonderful.</p> <p>"Oh, baby," I gasp.</p> <p>You push it in as far as it will go. My orgasm hits and I buck against you. I move and writhe my hips around, trying to get the egg as deep inside me as possible. I want it to slide out of me and feel it slide back in.</p> <p>You start to massage my clit as I go wild.</p> <p>"Oh, Daddy," I moan. "Please make it last a little longer. Please make it last!"</p> <p>I feel your tongue flick my clitoris over and over. My moans are growing louder.</p> <p>You bring the two vibrators down and then hold them with one hand under my belly while you run the other around my clit, gently and firmly. I'm almost there already. You know how to make it last.</p> <p>You take the end of your tongue and start to flick me just as the big egg starts sliding into me. We go up and down inside of me, all the way up. I'm moaning and I feel so full.</p> <p>Suddenly I'm almost there and I look into your eyes, my face in your lap. Your eyes are half closed. Your mouth is agape. I want to look at you. I want to see you cum. I want to feel you cum.</p> <p>I grab your dick with my other hand and work it as hard as I can. It feels great to have you hard. I want to feel your cum squirting against my thighs and drip onto my legs. I put the egg deep inside me and your hands go to my hips. You pull me in.</p> <p>I feel you throbbing as I rub the vibrator against the side of my pussy. You tell me to pull it out so you can cum on my breasts. I do, it makes me explode so hard. I put the smaller vibrator to your lips and let you get some of the juice on it. You lick it up and lick me some. I cum again as you take the smaller vibrator in your hand.</p> <p>Your orgasm is so intense I just sit on you and watch. I can feel your legs go weak.</p> <p>You tell me to come up on the bed and sit next to you. I want you so much.</p> <p>"I love when you say that," I say. "I love when you make me feel like I have. I love your mouth. I love it when you slide your tongue inside me."</p> <p>You kiss me and we lay with my feet on your thighs as we talk about everything in the world.</p> <p>"Would you like to do this again?" you ask.</p> <p>I think about it. I know it has to be soon. And I can't wait.</p> <p>We have so much more to doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
