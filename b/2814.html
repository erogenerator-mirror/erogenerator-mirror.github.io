"But, if you keep telling me the truth, and we both agree, we will probably end up with a pretty nice life together, as long as we keep this to ourselves."</p> <p>We sat quietly, staring out the bay window for a few minutes. We were both smiling. She was looking out at the beautiful day she was married to.</p> <p>"Do you remember when you and I were on campus?" he asked. "I had taken a job as a teacher. It was kind of cute. That wasn't so hard; just easy work, even."</p> <p>"I think it was hard for me too," she said with a grin. "But I don't think I can do it with you, if you don't want me to. You know how I'm with all these people, and it wouldn't be right."</p> <p>"But you did it for me, didn't you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Of course I did," she said, putting her arm around him and squeezing him. "When I first approached you when you first came to us, I thought it made you happy. Then, even though it was very embarrassing, I was very proud of you, and I think when you looked up into my eyes in the hallway...I kind of..."</p> <p>As she said this, she held onto him tighter. He ran his arms all the way through her hair, and he was afraid he would lose it if he let it go. She smelled great, and he enjoyed every minute. He liked the feeling of her hair against his skin, and he liked the contrast between her smooth skin and his coarse.</p> <p>She pulled away from him to look up at him. "I can't," she said, "I've been divorced for a couple of years now, so I don't really have to."</p> <p>"I guess you don't have to," he said, still feeling very bad for this old bitch.</p> <p>"I'm not your mom," she said, standing up and going over to her suitcase. She pulled her things into the closet and began fiddling around the top, and he watched her take off her dress. He felt himself hardening a little as he watched her. Her shoulders were toned and her breasts were larger than he had imagined. Even at that age, she looked good.</p> <p>"I bought it when I was twenty years old, it looked great, and it doesn't get any better than that," she said, putting it on, which exposed her long, firm thighs. He noticed that her underwear wasn't as sexy as this outfit. It seemed to come up her legs to her knees. It clung tightly to each hip and ended with a low cut neckline. It did little more than cover the front of her breasts, in small, thin strips that hung down to almost touch the floor. It barely reached the bottoms of her feet. However, they were long enough to cover the tops and bottom of her legs. The skirt fell around the back of her thighs, but it was very low, revealing her entire upper body from the waist all the way to her elbows. It ended just above her butt and it covered only about halfway between her butt and the inside of her thighs. She didn't seem to be wearing any panties underneath, or there was a hint of a darkening of her pubic hair, but she had a pretty nice looking butt. She had to be a little over eight inches in height for her size, but it looked pretty good in the dim light and was not at all bad to look at.</p> <p>He was still trying to digest the situation because she had stopped rubbing her thighs together, only to turn and put them both on display, just a couple of feet from his eyes. He sat in stunned disbelief. She was obviously feeling sexual again, something she hadn't done since she made the offer to him at college. She had even gotten his cock to respond by pushing against it. He could feel it as he had last night, so he could feel it in a more physical way. It did nothing to soothe the raging erection he had already had.</p> <p>"I think it's time you got a break," she said, getting back into the chair and crossing her legs like she had before. She looked at him and smiled. "When do you think the day will come when you and I could..."</p> <p>As she said that last part, she let her thigh rub against his. He had his hand in her hair and he felt the softness of her hair. She put her hand on top of his and felt his hardness. She moved in closer and put her hand inside his jacket pocket, which he noticed were not folded. She pulled out his wallet and showed him around the wallet.</p> <p>"You don't needâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
