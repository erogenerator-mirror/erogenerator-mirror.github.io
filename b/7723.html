Without thinking, she pulled her shirt back again, exposing her large breasts. She wrapped her arms back around my neck.</p> <p>This was so wrong but all the passion drove me wild and I found myself kissing her deeply. She opened her mouth wider. We both lost ourselves in that kiss. We were moaning in unison and in ecstasy and I realized I had pulled down all the way down on a beach towel with her and I was cupping her heavy breasts, and her eyes were wide in amazement. She had always had a beautiful body. She had small but nice rounded breasts and a slight curve around her waist.</p> <p>It took a little bit and I was on top of her when I realized she was not wearing a bottom, which was much easier. My bare lower half was touching her waist and I could feel the heat from her wet crotch.</p> <p>She pulled back and looked into my eyes. "Are you sure you don't want me in this body? I've been on the road with a vibrator all week; it's not like it would be something we'd not get from the hotel."</p> <p>"That depends on how you take it." I answered for both of us, "If you're not into being out in public with a dick in your hand, your choice."</p> <p>She looked down at me and smiled. "You're such a tease." and she slowly pulled my shirt off over my head. I pulled off my t-shirt too and we were naked together again, lying there in the warm sun with just a bit of sweat on our nude skin, the sun beating down on us as we both lay in the afternoon.</p> <p>My cock was hard. "Just relax for the ride," she said, "We have lots of time."</p> <p>I rolled over to see how her breasts jiggled. "That's a nice round pinkish-red thing, they're almost like a set of tits."</p> <p>"I don't have much of those for me," she said, "I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable with me having a guy in our bedroom. Now that you have a nice cock in you, let me know and we can make up for it." She grabbed my hard cock and positioned it to her opening lips. My knob parted her lips and I slid my head in.</p> <p>"My pussy is already pretty wet for your cock," she said, "I need no lube."</p> <p>"I never knew doing this was doing anything at all...but you're so fucking tight."</p> <p>I pulled out of her and then pushed back in. I pushed in as hard as I could and felt her lips tighten around me.</p> <p>"Ohh, yeah," she said, "keep going...you're hitting my g-spot."</p> <p>She started moving her hips as I pulled out until just the base of my knob was in her and then I plunged in again. Her wetness wrapped around my shaft causing it to slide in and out with ease. I pulled out until just the base of my cock was in her pussy and then I thrust all the way back in again. My balls were already swelling and I knew that it wouldn't be long before I was filling her up with my cum. I reached around to caress her breasts and she turned her face to catch mine and we kissed long and hard.</p> <p>"You're so hard," she said to me.</p> <p>"Yes, I am."</p> <p>We continued to kiss each other like that for a few moments. Her lips were soft. She was warm and wet and we were in one of the most beautiful places in the world again. I kissed her neck and breasts, and I nibbled her nipples. She sucked on my bottom lip and let go of it just before I'd do exactly the same to her mouth, which I did a few times.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she mumbled.</p> <p>Her hips kept moving in time with my thrusts and my cock was pushing hard in and out of her. I was sure that a little bit of pain wouldn't kill me but I didn't care. I was getting really close.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum when I'm close to cumming," I told her.</p> <p>"Me too. I know you can cum whenever you want...but I want to feel you release...it feels so good."</p> <p>She was still sucking my bottom lip. "You feel so good," she exclaimed and she started moving her hips in the same way that she was moving her hips in mine.</p> <p>"I want to cum too," I said.</p> <p>"And I want you to cum as well," she replied.</p> <p>We continued this for a few minutes and then we started moving more rapidly againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
