Leave." He shouted, trying to get the anger out.</p> <p>"Shut up dad and listen. She's only 15."</p> <p>"I still know how she is, why would she leave here like that."</p> <p>"I thought you were a hard ass."</p> <p>"I am mom. She should be spending her day alone."</p> <p>I should look around. Was there any hope in this, if there was I would be so disgusted by her and the person that I am being taken advantage of by?</p> <p>"Is my daughter here?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, she's here, isn't she?" his dad replied.</p> <p>"Oh yea." Heather's mother replied.</p> <p>I watched as he stood up and looked at his daughter, now in only her white robe.</p> <p>"So do we have a deal?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," Heather's mother responded.</p> <p>Heather's dad grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into a bedroom.</p> <p>"Sit down here with me, so you can watch."</p> <p>Heather's father threw a blanket over Heather and sat on the side of the bed. He pulled up Heather's robe and sat beside her father.</p> <p>"I have something for you."</p> <p>I didn't know how to feel. Was it too soon after watching Heather's mother and his daughter getting it on while I was gone?</p> <p>"Dad, he can't do this. They won't go to him again. I'm sure they will think about it all the same time."</p> <p>Heather's father leaned over and kissed his daughter.</p> <p>"We better go, we'll be back at my place tomorrow, or he'll be punished worse."</p> <p>"Dad, we will never do anything like this again," Heather's mother replied.</p> <p>"We don't mean it dad, we just want things changed before they come out, and this is just something to help keep us safe."</p> <p>"No way. I told you he was the best, he's a good man, and I trust him. Go on with your studies, you are done."</p> <p>"No," Heather replied.</p> <p>"And you will think before you even speak to her, you don't need her here. She should be studying, and she would get in trouble."</p> <p>His father pulled up Heather's robe and threw it at her.</p> <p>"Leave her alone dad, I love her."</p> <p>"Do you have any idea how bad he felt?"</p> <p>"No," Heather replied.</p> <p>Heather's father lifted her by the arm and sat her down on his lap. He took her face in his hands and pulled her to kiss her lightly. I saw her body shudder as his hands kneaded her breasts. I got up and went to her parents.</p> <p>"Do you need anything, mom, can you take me home?"</p> <p>"Yes honey, I need some sleep too," she said.</p> <p>"Okay, Heather, I'll meet you in the bathroom."</p> <p>I went to Heather's room and took in the sight of her lying on her back naked on her mothers bed, her robe opened up to her waist, her arms around her husband. I went to take a shower again and left him to his studies.</p> <p>- - - - - - -</p> <p>A few months after my mother and I moved in with Heather, we received the letter from the school. My father was furious at Heather, and his hatred rose as soon as I heard she was leaving. To our surprise, my father sent Heather one last letter saying she had gone. My mother and I were in love, and her anger was only temporary as my relationship with her began to change. The change was obvious, and in turn my father was upset. It is hard not to be confused but I didn't think it was possible.</p> <p>It took us 4 months to leave, to go back to our home, and to see Heather at school, to see out her life, to hold her in my heart all my life. I was sure that Heather's father would never see this but I was wrong.</p> <p>It had been 6 months since the letter, and when he was in the principal's office Heather walked in, in her robe, looking like I had never seen her.
