I just want to see you again for real." She leaned in as he put his arms around her waist and pulled her close. He took a deep sniff of the scent of her before planting another kiss on her lips. She moaned as she leaned up into his mouth and he pulled her down, his cock pressing eagerly against her. She leaned up again and ran her tongue around the head of his cock. "Do we have to take this all the way off?" She pouted. "Don't want any other part of the bargain." He replied as he lowered his chest down to her breasts, teasing her nipples between his fingers while his hips thrust upward against her stomach. Her breathing grew ragged as she kissed him feverishly. She let a whimper escape her throat as he pinched the sensitive flesh below her navel, making all the air leave her body quickly. Her hands flew to his head, digging her fingers into his hair as he teased a sensitive spot just under her navel. As she tugged his head back she gasped, "Oh god! Please! Please!" He pushed her back, breaking the grip on her breasts and he ran his hands up her body, pushing into the small of her back to press her against him. Again the tip of his index finger danced across her swollen pussy, eliciting a low moan as it slid into her opening. "I want you." He whispered, lowering his body down to her level. She raised her knees to wrap around his hips. "Fuck me." She whispered. As she rolled a finger down the middle of his cock he pulled her back, his mouth finding hers once more. As their bodies began to grind into each other he felt her body go slack, and the pleasure of her body made him grow and grow inside her. He pushed against her back in a steady rhythm that made her breasts heave against his chest. He lifted her hips off the floor with his own as one hand gripped his hair and the other circled his neck, pulling his body into hers. She ground her hips into him, trying to move in perfect sync with his own movements as they fucked. He felt her body go numb as he thrust into her. He groaned against her lips as he continued to thrust within her, feeling the heat of her body against him, the wetness of her juices as she moved beneath him and around him. Her mouth found his neck again, sucking gently as her nails drew on his skin. Her kisses were burning as he continued to slowly thrust into her; he felt her body tremble and her muscles tighten around him as she came hard, her pussy clenching his cock as her body convulsed over and over as he continued to thrust into her. He felt her hand go to his head, pushing it into her breasts as he continued to thrust with her body. "I'm going to come soon." He moaned and thrust at her hard, burying himself deep within her as his own came. Both of them moaned as their bodies tensed together, their mouths pressing together as they came down from their intensity. He laid his head on her shoulder, resting his hands on her breasts again. "Thank you baby." She murmured against his ear. He lifted his head and smiled against her neck. "My pleasure." He whispered, leaning down to kiss her on the top of her head, drawing another groan from her lips. She kissed his forehead and he watched her with a smile before closing his eyes, returning her smile. "Well aren't we the innocent."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>CJ and Sherry stayed up all night talking about what happened the previous night. They had no idea how to broach what just happened in detail, and for some reason they didn't want to get the night's details out of the way as fast as possible. They talked more and more until it was very late, the sun was setting and Sherry's headache had subsided at a break-neck pace. Neither of them had any regrets except about what the future held. They had just spent the night getting to know each other. They had known they could trust each other for so long, but now the thought of having a relationship with Jana had just crossed the line into friendship.</p> <p>It seemed like it was only a matter of time before they were leaving the resort and heading back to Jana's family. It was true that it would be a good chance to see and be with her, but as they had never gotten to know each other before, there was something lacking.</p> <p>"She left." Janna heard Janna say quietly.</p> <p>"Well, she did give us a chance to get to know each other in a new light. I got to know both Sherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
