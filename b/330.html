I said looking up at her. "I can't believe my luck, it's amazing." She said.</p> <p>She wrapped her large hands around my waist and pulled me closer. She looked down at my erection and said, "Look."</p> <p>She began to stroke the shaft and put both hands on the side of my cock. She looked up at me and said, "How do you like it?"</p> <p>"Oh I love it." I said.</p> <p>She took the shaft into her hand and began to rub it against her cheek. She looked up at me with a mischievous smile and said, "I love it too."</p> <p>I grabbed her hand and pressed it against my chest. It felt so good. When I ran my thumb down her arm she brought her hand up and began to caress her palm. She brought her hand back up and looked up at me as if she wanted to say something but couldn't really.</p> <p>"Do you like this, don't you?" she said. She said it like it was a question but didn't say it.</p> <p>I leaned in for another kiss and she pushed me away.</p> <p>"Let's get out of the rain, then you can feel it through my clothes." She said with a smile.</p> <p>I laughed and went up to let her in. She put her panties on first and she got dressed before I got dressed. We came to the door and we could see that all the other people had gone down to their cars. We got into the house and I helped her up the stairs. She put her panties on and we went into the living room.</p> <p>"I want to put your panties back on before you leave." she said with a smile. "Maybe tomorrow night." She turned and headed for the stairs. I followed her up. When she passed the landing and began to walk down the hall she looked back at me and said, "I think I'm leaving, now." She turned and went into the house.</p> <p>"So," I said, "How did you sleep?"</p> <p>She smiled. "There is not anyone in your house to go downstairs to, is there."</p> <p>I laughed. "I slept like a log."</p> <p>I headed for the stairs. I stopped when the basement door opened and she entered the house. She walked with me to the living room where I picked up my clothes and took them into the bathroom and put my underwear back on but just got a towel and started to dry my hair. We sat on the sofa and I told her how my evening went. How things turned out.</p> <p>"I knew you enjoyed your time." I said.</p> <p>"I'm sure you could tell." She said. "It felt as special to you as it does to me."</p> <p>We sat silently for several minutes just staring at each other. "I can't believe we just got up to just walk out of here and talk about this," she said, "and to just go up there and just sit together."</p> <p>I laughed. "You know it is a beautiful night."</p> <p>"Yes I know but this doesn't just be about me, you have to remember how good we were going to be." She said.</p> <p>"I don't know about that but I'm beginning to think we are going to be a lot closer to where we were going with things." I said.</p> <p>We talked about what happened today and she really didn't even think about what was just going on down there. She had a great sense of humor. She took out her camera and began to take pictures of the house from the upstairs part of her room while she kept looking at me.</p> <p>"Where did you go today?" she asked. I pointed toward the bathroom.</p> <p>"You have to tell me." I said. "I think I'm going to need a bath soon." I said.</p> <p>"No time to talk." She said.</p> <p>I went back to the bathroom to get my washcloth. I walked back toward the bedroom. Standing before her I put my hands on her shoulders and knelt in front of her and pulled her toward me. She opened my robe and pulled my boxers down. I sat on the edge of the bed and leaned toward her. She reached out and pulled me toward her mouth. She slowly pushed her tongue out.</p> <p>"You'll have to tell me about this." she said. "Maybe we'll have to start right away, because there is so much we can share. Let me get this far, I have to know what this means to you."</p> <p>When I reached up and pulled her to me she said, "No, tonight, no matter what happens, letâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
