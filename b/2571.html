I had gotten off her and she was having fun, but I'd heard her swear a little.</p> <p>"Uh, well, yes, I did. But, no, I shouldn't have. I... I'm not a slut." I couldn't believe how nervous I was. This whole thing was too weird. I felt like I couldn't be in charge anymore. I had no control at all and I was afraid of what would happen afterwards.</p> <p>"So do you think you could handle going to the man's club?" she asked. "It would be a lot more fun than watching you strip and dancing, right?" she added.</p> <p>"Um, yeah. I guess that's a safe bet." I said nervously again. "So... what does it look like?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's kind of like hanging out!" she remarked.</p> <p>She looked down at the tent in my jeans and it seemed obvious. "It looks like it's really uncomfortable. I'm sorry," she said with a shrug. "If you'd like to touch it, I'm all for it."</p> <p>"Can I touch it?" I asked hopefully.</p> <p>"Oh yeah. It's uncomfortable."</p> <p>I was hesitant but she looked up at me, giving me the eye. I leaned over and kissed her. It was sweet and soft and the kiss itself was very different to the last time we kissed. We didn't really do anything else. She kissed me softly and then quickly pulled away, leaving me unsure how she was feeling. I took a minute to think about what should happen next. This is probably our first experience with a sex life since high school, so let's go through with it.</p> <p>We broke the kiss and stood up as the waitress came along. Once the food was delivered to our table, I sat down and took a bite. It wasn't that hard to eat something to, but the food was all I could afford. It was actually kind of funny how her eyes were like that. I guess I was too nervous to notice what she was staring at or that she was ogling my crotch. I looked down at my hand and felt like I was getting a hard-on.</p> <p>She seemed a little out of it, too. "So you want to do some guy-girl stuff?" she asked. "You know, just get to know each other a bit and not feel so awkward around each other," she added.</p> <p>I shrugged. "Sure. Right." If I hadn't already had an erection, I probably would have already gotten hard. I was glad that she wasn't really getting turned on from the way I was touching her. Maybe I'd feel a little better after all this has gone on.</p> <p>After we ordered, we chatted about work, and just as I was thinking it was hard to concentrate with the meal in front of me, she asked if I had thought about our next encounter in the strip clubs. She was obviously embarrassed and nervous. I'm sure that was what I'd been thinking about. I know that what would have happened in the strip clubs on our date would go over better in my head. But it just didn't happen last night.</p> <p>"Um," I stammered. I was having a hard time not focusing on her. "This is not a club. I mean, where did you and your friend go?"</p> <p>"Well, when we decided to go, we took a cab, didn't we," she admitted. "But I think we could use a little privacy around there. You know, like being out in public, seeing other people for the first time. We could definitely see each other on occasion."</p> <p>I swallowed. "You want to do some guy-girl stuff?" I asked anxiously. I was going to ask her to do a guy-girl, but I thought the conversation was going too far. I figured she'd say no then. I mean, she didn't have to know what I was thinking. This whole thing seemed so scary, so risky.</p> <p>"Sure. I guess. We could go to a friend's club. Or we could get a few more beers and see how it goes." She nodded.</p> <p>"Yeah, sure. Let's go to her place to get to know each other and maybe even do the next thing?" I offered.</p> <p>I didn't think she'd say no to that. She had me and she trusted me enough to give me a chance to say no if she wanted. She was very trusting. Of course she trusted me too. Not that I felt guilty about liking her, but that she trusted me enough to know that I had no intention of doing anything just to try and be friends with her.</p> <p>She got up after the food was finished, wentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
