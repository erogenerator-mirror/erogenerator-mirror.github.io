He felt them graze his body, and begin running up his neck and across his chin. She kissed the side of his neck down to his jaw, across his collarbone ...and finally the upper neckline. He was in heaven, when she looked up at him, smiling that sexy smile to herself, one inch wide.</p> <p>"God, I want you. I can't believe it, I... I've got... to, I... to have you. Do you know how long it has been? Don't I feel that I have been dreaming about this?"</p> <p>She was not thinking, but just the sight of him was too much to be contained. His eyes sparkled as he looked her over, and she took the bottle of body oil and began to massage it on him, rubbing it into his chest. She leaned down, running her hands along his neck and chest, her lips just brushing his chin. She looked up at him, and in the midst of the oil, he looked so much like her that he forgot to breath.</p> <p>When she got down to his cock, she saw that he was fully hard. She knew that she had to have him now, too, and she gave him a questioning look. "Do you want to suck me?"</p> <p>Her hand was working on him slowly, and he felt his head growing in her hand. "God yes!"</p> <p>"Oh, God, you like that?" she asked with a devilish smile. She began to stroke his head gently, her hand running all the way past his thick shaft. "Oh... it's so nice..." Her hand was moving up and down slowly, letting go only when she could feel his pulse coming up. He was so big, and she had never taken the time to be able to get it fully into her mouth, but she could hear it, and he seemed to enjoy that. He reached down to help her by pumping himself into her hand, and it wasn't long before she had gotten him good and wet inside. She looked down at him, saw a big bulge there, and felt her heart thudding with excitement. He was huge! And she had to have him. She had to have him now!</p> <p>She looked up at his face, and smiled, and then gave him a big kiss, and began to rub and stroke her big tits. She began to kiss lower down his chest, her mouth sucking on his bellybutton and kissing his cock, and as she kissed lower, she felt her hand going to the base of his cock and her finger sliding into his ass, just as her mouth closed on him. The sight of her sucking on his cock and feeling his hands on her tits, licking him, had a powerful effect on him, and his hips rose upward and his cock jerked with the force of his orgasm. He felt her body spasm as his cock, even bigger than she had expected earlier, began to spurt into her mouth as she felt him fill her with his cum and the way her jaw clung to his cock, his ass, clenching his cock, sending spurt after spurt of hot cum into her mouth.</p> <p>He felt her relax her lips against his cock as she swallowed his hot juices. He could have stayed there forever, feeling her tongue working his cock clean, but he pulled himself up to lay beside her. He reached out and she took the bottle of baby oil that he had been holding, and poured some onto her nipples, and a bit over her tits, letting him glide down her body. His fingers began to trace her belly all the way down to her pussy - she had always licked her own wetness to make one before, but he had never done that. She watched his eyes and smiled as her breasts began to sway as her breathing quickened.</p> <p>"My God, you are so sexy!" He leaned down and began to suck her nipples while he continued to play with her pussy. She ran both her hands through his hair, playing with it while he sucked her tits. "You're so beautiful," he said, as he continued to play with her breasts. "Your tits are beautiful."</p> <p>"They're so beautiful. Do you mind if I keep them?"</p> <p>"Sure!"</p> <p>They got up and moved over to the bed and lay together. He kissed her, and put an arm across her body, playing with her nipples, and playing with her pussy with his other hand. She ran her nails down his back and down the front of his body, leaving warm loving attention there, loving how smooth and sexy he felt there with her.
