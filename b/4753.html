She turned to me and kissed me again. She was still so wet and warm, so comfortable and comfortable, and I was so hard by then that it was hard to imagine that we could fall asleep in each other's arms. Her hand was between us toying with my cock now, touching it gently, caressing it. My body was so sensitive after having been abused, abused for so long without any respite.</p> <p>My left tit got a squeeze and she pulled away.</p> <p>"No, go lower, and kiss me. " she said and I did. My lips on hers were warm, as soft as any woman's touch and gentle. We made out with each other. It was so strange that I could say that to a girl, my older sister. When you kissed me...it started at my left nipple. You're my little sister, not my lover! " she said softly.</p> <p>My nipples were hard and sensitive...</p> <p>"They've been such a long time, " I thought as that gentle tit felt mine.</p> <p>My fingers brushed over her nipple, making her shiver. It was so beautiful to hold her like that. So soft and wonderful to be able to touch and kiss and feel her like that. There wouldn't be anything that we wouldn't do together. The difference was that when we were together we made love. She said she loved the feeling...she said that she loved it when I kissed her. I loved it when she did that as well. When we were in bed together neither of us had to think; we could do it. "</p> <p>"Oh, Mom...That feels so good to have you hold me like that. You were right. I love being held like that," she said. Her voice, as soft as a whisper was like silk to me. I had never really been close to this kind of intimacy with my mother, but I was so very close to her now. There was nothing else in the world between us except us.</p> <p>"Your body feels so beautiful and warm under me...so soft. I can't imagine it being so warm in my arms. "</p> <p>Her other hand was on my leg, stroking upwards to my cock, stroking me. She leaned down to kiss me again. We could each feel the heat emanating from each other, the hardness of my cock, and her hand, as she gently stroked up and down, and I groaned. I had never really felt as much as I did when she was stroking me. It was as though I was floating. I was completely at her mercy. My heart felt as though I was going to burst at the sight of her beautiful body. There was no holding back at all as she kept me as hard as she could without losing any of my hardness.</p> <p>"I want you to make love to me."</p> <p>"What?" I panted. "Is that possible? Please? "</p> <p>"It would be perfect." She kissed me again, her fingers moving higher and higher on my leg. "Don't be a stranger, just go for it. " And she got up off of the bed and got out of the robe she was wearing when I woke up. She got a condom out of the dresser drawer and got a couple off the bed. I'd never taken a condom until I got to college but this just felt so good...so right to have it. I rolled it on so it wasn't too big.</p> <p>It felt so sexy to move my lips down to it for the first time and I could feel how slippery and wet it had gotten. I kissed it a little bit and then kissed its head. I could take it and never take it back. A few times I had to make a long, slow, smooth stroke over the head with my tongue before taking her in my mouth. That was so good to have!</p> <p>Then she lay down on the bed and she said "Go on, I want to feel you inside me."</p> <p>She lifted her hips off the bed and I got up on my knees between her ankles. I looked at the head of my cock to see that it was just resting there...that was what her "little" secret was about. I leaned forward slightly just inside. She took a breath and asked "Do you want it inside? "</p> <p>"Fuck me...do it." she said softly.</p> <p>My head slowly moved towards the tip of my cock as I leaned forward and gently pressed my lips onto hers. We were so turned on and wet and warm...so aroused...so very, very wet. I kissed her more softly as I moved my body a little more forward.</p> <p>She lifted her hips until my cock touched the back of her thigh on my other knee as I continued to push my hand forward. I got closerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
