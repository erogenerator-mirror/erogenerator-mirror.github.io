His face was a picture of excitement, his eyes glazed with lust. I knew I had to reach up to touch him, but it was so good it was too weird to pull away. I grabbed onto his hand as it tightened around my wrist, and pulled him close. I was on my first orgasm of the night and I was ready to try a fifth.</p> <p>His lips met mine in a kiss. I could feel myself start to tingle again through the intensity of the moment. It had only been two days and we knew each other so well that there could only be one way to pleasure each other. I held back for only a minute, holding back for far longer, before I started to moan softly into his mouth. He pulled away from me to kiss me one more time before he pulled me up to my feet.</p> <p>I looked into his eyes as I walked to the couch. He pulled me back into his arms gently and kissed me once more. We looked into each other's eyes and he looked like he would never leave me again. I was ready for him at that moment, but I felt I needed to go slow. I hadn't cum in a week and I was exhausted. He picked me up into his arms in one sweep and laid me on my back. It didn't take much for us kissing to come back into the room. I kissed him passionately once more, feeling his naked body against mine. I laid my head on the pillow as he kissed my chest, licking from my nipple to my navel and finally to my other breast.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, letting our passionate kisses lull me back to sleep. I heard him undressing and a few minutes later he was on top of me. His erect cock rested between my breasts. I took his hands in mine as I ran my fingers softly along his shaft. He leaned down and kissed me gently before pulling me onto the bed. He positioned my legs across his hips so I was straddling him with my bum in the air. He put his hands on my bum and pulled me closer to him. I could feel every hard inch of his hard cock as I lowered.</p> <p>He slipped inside my wet pussy and I screamed out in pleasure. I wrapped my arms tightly around his neck and pulled him closer. He pushed his mouth down on mine so we could explore each others mouth more fully. Our tongues began to dance together in a dance that I would never forget. I could feel my second climax building. It seemed to start to bubble up inside of me. I felt like I had a life raft in my hands as orgasm built inside of me. It was a feeling I hadn't felt in more than a week. It wasn't the intense sensation of being on top of a man and feeling his hard cock moving in and out of me, or the feeling that could only come from inside of him. In the back of my mind I was thinking "No! I can't. I'm married. I can't do this." This is no longer about him fucking me. I have found love, love, and fulfillment. I had found something for all of this to happen.</p> <p>As I began to slow down, I could feel him beginning to grow inside of me. It was a feeling I never felt before. His fingers slowly rubbed my thighs. I started to wonder "Should I tell him...what are you doing to me?"</p> <p>"I think you should tell me," he instructed.</p> <p>"No!" I said. He pulled his hands away.</p> <p>"Well...what's wrong?" I asked him.</p> <p>"I think you should tell me"</p> <p>I didn't wait for him to say anything else. I wanted him to say what he wanted to, but we wouldn't do what the other wanted. It felt way too different from how he wanted it to be. Instead he simply lay there, his cock in my wet pussy. I could feel it moving inside of me again as it continued to grow inside of my belly.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," he moaned softly.</p> <p>"I think..." I hesitated. "That I should tell you what I want from you."</p> <p>"Yes!" He kissed me lovingly before he pulled his cock out from inside of me and began to untie my bikini.</p> <p>He then quickly undid my bikini top and began to kiss and lick and nibble my body. I could feel him reaching down to fondle my breasts lightly and suck on my nipples. He could feel the excitement begin to build in me as he kissed and caressed them.</p> <p>"Come with me," he growled. I couldn't believe it, but I couldn't stop him from moving his hands up to my shoulders, but instead of pulling me to his lap I was lifted from his lap and guided by his hands onto his face. Once again we kissed as he pushed me to a sitting position andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
