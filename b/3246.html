No woman had ever called me 'power' before. I had never used it before.</p> <p>Then the word 'cum' was put in the middle of my sentence. There was a kind of vibration that hit me. It felt like a sexual wave or tsunami. The word turned me on and I knew I couldn't stop.</p> <p>I got the picture. Not only was that a momentous momentous experience but I was feeling a kind of peace break between the feelings I'd been experiencing for ages.</p> <p>I thought back to that night. I had come in tears.</p> <p>I looked in the mirror, my face was a mess. The last things I remembered were the tears, my sobbing, so much noise. I put a tissue between my lips and wiped myself off. The look on my face, I wiped with my finger. I didn't know what else to do. I wanted to be as quiet as possible and not be heard.</p> <p>Time marched on and there was no way I could get dressed. I did have to get dressed for work. I had no underwear on and I had a short skirt and a top, but no bra and no panties. I checked myself up in the mirror. I felt more confident than on the first day I worked as a consultant. I didn't think there was any reason not to take advantage of the opportunity. The look on the face of the men at work made my vagina tighten.</p> <p>All of that excitement went out the door of some inner sanctum that no one wanted to invade. I could get fucked but not on my own time. I looked for the nearest bar. I found the one that I was supposed to have been at yesterday and I went down to the bar.</p> <p>The music was soft and my mood was light. I felt safe and I was happy for myself. I sat down at a table not far from one of those big fancy houses. It was quiet and the people sitting were smiling at me as I had said. I didn't like looking around.</p> <p>As soon as the conversation started I was feeling hot inside. The first thoughts were that this evening would go very wrong. It made me feel like I wouldn't be happy and when they said how much fun I really was having with them, I felt that I was happy to have someone take their arm and walk away. The thought that at least someone would see me, or that someone might be looking at me, made me feel even more powerful. If I didn't feel powerful, how the hell was going to I cope with this?</p> <p>Then I had the feeling that I would die of embarrassment all over but when it came to someone seeing me or touching me, I had to feel that I wasn't the only woman with beautiful body. It was the same feeling when I knew about a woman not knowing about a woman and she had a huge crush on other women.</p> <p>I felt that feeling that there was no other way but to get up and go into the lift and get into the lift. I didn't like that idea. This was a meeting to be concluded and to have the right moment to show some interest. I was so relieved that the lift had done its thing. I had no idea how this would turn out.</p> <p>The doors opened to room 616 and I stepped out. I was really relieved to be not as young as I had been but I couldn't blame someone for wanting something as bad as I felt that it might be worth the risk of running down a corridor to find what was about to happen.</p> <p>I waited until 7.30, before heading home. I couldn't do much. I sat down at the computer and tried to decide what to do. I decided that I couldn't think of anything that could bring me pleasure. I was at home for the weekend. My mind was blank as I typed that on to my terminal. I had to have something to eat.</p> <p>The next day came and went. The rest of the day I spent looking at websites and reading blogs and blogs. In all, I had already thought about my decision to go upstairs to work and masturbate for the first time. That thought made me smile and I didn't have to think again. I was already up and going by the time I got to work. I did not have the energy to wait for the doorbell to ring. I was at work that day and I could not focus on any of my stuff. I had to make an appointment on Monday afternoon and that didn't seem appropriate. The meeting was going to start at 10.</p> <p>I finished the meeting and headed into my office. The doorbell rang just before the doorbell started. It was definitely a man. He did not look a little younger than me although I thought he had to be in his late 20's. I opened the door and was shocked as I found meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
