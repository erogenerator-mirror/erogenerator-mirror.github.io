"Yes I do," he admitted, "You are so beautiful." He pulled the door shut behind him, grabbed one of her feet and lifted her off the floor, throwing her down on the couch. She was shocked, the feel of her legs against his made her feel light-headed. She wrapped her arms around him, not believing how hot she was, feeling all of him inside her. Their tongues snaked all over each other, exploring each other's mouth and the soft flesh of their legs.</p> <p>She felt her pussy lips parting under his shaft and she pulled his hands onto her chest and helped him enter her from behind. When he pushed himself inside her, they both let out a moan. It had been four weeks since her last orgasm, and she was already a little sore. But he just held himself firmly in her and she felt as if he was going to cum inside her. He began to move inside her, pushing himself in and out and she could feel him swell up. Suddenly, she felt his hot cum squirting inside her. She felt his warmth against the inside of her pussy and her pussy contracted so hard, she lost control and she had her first orgasm.</p> <p>As the two of them laid there in each other's arms, she looked over her shoulder. The glow from the fire had faded and the fire burned out around them. "That was wonderful," she whispered to him.</p> <p>"Thanks, I have never cum that hard or that long before," he said, smiling. "You seem a little uncomfortable with the situation."</p> <p>"I guess it's because of the beer and the sex, isn't it?"</p> <p>He chuckled, "No, it's more the drink. The sex that we have been engaged in since we were in the same class just now. You don't think I'm a bit over-excited now, do you?" he turned around and kissed her mouth again. "Come on, let's get to bed," he said, pulling away from her and leading her into the guest room. When she got close to the bed, he turned back around and pulled her close to him.</p> <p>She couldn't believe how good he felt inside her and she felt safe in his arms. "We can't do this." she mumbled under her breath. "We can't even get to the bed."</p> <p>"But," he said, "we should really get you out of your clothes." "But what?" she said, looking over at him. But before she could move, he pulled her onto the bed. "Lay down," he said, "I will get some more wine and we'll go back to bed." He helped her lay down and she could feel his warm body against hers.</p> <p>As he moved toward her, he reached down and pulled her shirt off. "You look fantastic," he said, "and I don't want to leave any wet spots in the bed."</p> <p>She closed her eyes and felt him kiss her before pulling her pants off and climbing between her legs. "We don't have to do this," she said, "The only way we could, is if we both agree to it."</p> <p>He looked over at the fireplace, lit all of her candles and placed the wine on the coffee table. "You should be prepared for anything, especially if we want this to happen. We really do not have to do this. Besides, we both know that nothing could be worse than what is happening right now," he said, looking up from her eyes. "But, we shouldn't be here. We can't..."</p> <p>"It's ok. We can't do anything but think about having sex," she whispered, pressing her body against him as she lay face down on the bed.</p> <p>He moved his body up in between her legs and pressed them up against her stomach as he leaned up and kissed her neck. He was getting excited just looking at her and he wanted to make love. He had never felt like this before. As he kissed her neck, he moved his hand down toward her breast, lightly cupping her breasts from underneath. She felt his lips on her neck as he kissed up toward her ear. As his tongue came closer to her ear, then down toward her jawline, he felt her breath come in short gasps. He felt her shiver on his tongue's path and then as she felt him slip a finger inside her, she pulled his head against her body, her heart beat in her chest. Then, after a second, she felt him lower his mouth to her ear and gently bite it. Again she gasped as her body tightened and her vagina muscles contracted. He felt her body convulse on his tongue and felt her body respond by pressing against his tongue. Their hands were exploring each other as his lips were moving across her cheek toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
