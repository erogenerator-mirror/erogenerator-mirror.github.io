Oh...that's it, oh..oh that feels so good, oh..."</p> <p>I move all the way down and back up again. In and then out, back and forth. Faster, faster, and harder.</p> <p>"Oh...yes. Just like that. Oh..that...that's nice. Oh yes. Oh, just like that. Oh yes."</p> <p>There was a pause in the sounds. "Don't stop now" was all I could get out. She was going into orgasm after orgasm. All of me and just the one woman in her position was loving it. I was in heaven.</p> <p>"That's it baby. Don't stop. You feel so good".</p> <p>"A-h-h-h..oh!" was all she could get out. I didn't want to move too fast but she had just the right angle. Faster, a little faster. She was cumming again and her thighs closed on my hips trying to get me closer. I was right behind.</p> <p>"That's a good girl", she said "cum for me."</p> <p>There was no hesitation, no hesitation, just a quiet feeling of joy and happiness. She came for me to feel. She felt good. I could feel it. It was just as I remembered the way she wanted our first time to be. It was the only way she wanted us to ever be together.</p> <p>She turned herself off, she slid off me, I got a chance to sit as she looked at me. She kissed me once then moved to the side of the bed.</p> <p>"My turn now" she said.</p> <p>I started with her right leg and moved up to her hips. I ran my fingers up and down the entire length of her leg. She was already wet. I moved quickly to her other leg. I moved over that leg also to finish her off. I ran over each nipple, just gently and then ran over each of her legs. Her pussy was still wet and glistening. I looked at her pretty face and saw her smile. Her eyes were closed.</p> <p>"Would you like me a massage?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes, please", she said softly. "Please give me a good massage".</p> <p>I could only smile</p> <p>"I can't believe I'm even here", she said.</p> <p>She reached in the nightstand to get some oil and handed me the bottle and turned over.</p> <p>"Come here", she said again. We moved to the side of the bed. I sat astride her waist and she reached for my shoulders as I laid down.</p> <p>"This is how we are touching each other and kissing", she whispered. "Does that feel good?"</p> <p>"Yes, very much".</p> <p>"I know it does". My God, how I love this woman. She reached up and brushed her hands down my neck. My heart dropped in the instant. I had a feeling about her. She was beautiful.</p> <p>Her hands moved down to my breasts. Her fingertips teased my nipples as they moved over my breasts. I loved her touch. The feeling of her soft hands against my breasts as her thumbs teased just inside of the areola, I knew what I wanted. I wanted to hold her close to me and feel her body against mine. She started to lift my skirt up, slowly but surely. I lifted my hips so as to accommodate her. She was going to kiss me and feel my tongue with hers. She was going to go fast so fast that I would break. We were kissing. She was pushing her naked body against mine so hard that I thought I would explode before she even touched me. Finally she moved up and kissed my neck. I kissed her neck and face, moving slowly and sensually towards her lips. My hands moved on their own and touched her face. She had a sweet, very delicate touch, I wanted her to feel as I hoped she would feel. I moved a finger up between us and she opened her sweet lips and let it slide in. Her taste and her smell was as intoxicating as the scent of strawberries.</p> <p>She opened her mouth slightly wider as my finger slid in deeper. Then her mouth closed. I followed up with her tongue. She held me in place and slowly moved back, letting me slide out of her mouth again. Her finger reached out to me. Our eyes met.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?" she asked. I just smiled and just nodded my head. She moved to her knees, she moved her legs to the bottom on the bed. I moved up and sat, I watched her as she began to undo my blouse.
