But you could be a bit nicer. If you liked my body and the things that you've done to it, I'd love to continue that. But if you only did this once, you'll regret it."</p> <p>They left the dance floor and moved onto the sidewalk to walk through an alcove that looked as though it went through a gate. They stopped when they saw that several blocks away two security guards had drawn curtains. The other guards also stopped and watched. When the woman had reached the top of the steps, the guard had said, "The party is over," and turned to lead her down the stairs. "The lady is here to escort your lady downstairs, you know." He looked back to his guard and pointed as they headed toward the stairs. "The lady is here."</p> <p>A minute later, she was standing at the top of the stairs. "My lady is here, too!" She said with a giddy laugh.</p> <p>The men were following them down and the guards were following in the same direction. Now they had an entirely different idea of what the lady's escort was, but she wouldn't tell them. She couldn't tell them. "My lady is here, now. What is this lady's name?" She asked pointing at the woman.</p> <p>"My lady is here."</p> <p>"And there is my lady, now. She has chosen to be with you."</p> <p>The woman smiled sweetly.</p> <p>"My lady is here. That's why I told you she's here," she said with a slight laugh. "That and that she is looking forward to finding the woman who wants her to go home with you. The lady has already told you that she wants to fuck you for a while and then take her home at the end of the night. She's going to fuck you a lot tonight!"</p> <p>The lady smiled broadly. "That sounds like fun," she said.</p> <p>"You're going to fuck him," the guard said.</p> <p>"Yes, I have," the lady responded. "He's going to love it. He's going to be so good to her!"</p> <p>"I've seen him," the guard said with excitement.</p> <p>The lady smiled again, but not so much that she appeared to be embarrassed. "If I had my head turned toward the security guards, I'd have seen them," she said. "I'd be tempted to take him home tonight!" She smiled as though it made her a little less nervous. "The place looks as though it was a mansion. This looks very exclusive."</p> <p>Two guards stopped about ten paces away, but the other stopped right behind them. The lady was looking forward to having this man, and this was the way men did with her.</p> <p>The guard turned the woman to him. "My lady is here, now. Your man is here, too."</p> <p>"Then let's dance," the guard said. "If you want to dance, you should dance together for a while."</p> <p>The lady was stunned. "I don't dance!" She protested, but she did what other women were told.</p> <p>The man who had spoken to her earlier held out his hand and pulled her to him and lifted her into the air. She didn't resist at all. It was a lot, but she couldn't help herself. She looked up to her guard, but didn't say anything but she still smiled at him as she led him to the floor. He was leading her as the song ended and as the women moved onto the dance floor.</p> <p>The lady felt suddenly embarrassed again. Having sex with a man who was holding out his hand might have made her blush again, but it was as though she wanted to keep him. This man might not have done this earlier in the afternoon, but she couldn't help thinking how desirable she was.</p> <p>She found that having a man hold her, and this one, for dancing, as his lady was dancing, was a lot about sex, more about being held and being wanted. The lady felt a sense of exhilaration. "It's the most erotic feeling I've ever had," she thought. "He touches me like that and makes me feel so beautiful!"</p> <p>The guard held his hands over her waist for comfort as she danced, and then he had one hand on her behind, his arms around her waist for support. As the song ended, the man held her tighter to him, her body against his. They swayed for at least a minute or more, then the girl turned her face on him and gave him a peck on the lips.
