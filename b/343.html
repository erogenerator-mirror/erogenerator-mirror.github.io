She pushed the door shut as she headed for the door.</p> <p>My mind was in turmoil. Should I just let things go as they were? On a scale of one to fifteen, do I want to keep her? Her offer of sex might prove to be a little hypocritical, but it would probably help me deal with this a little bit. I should just stop and take a chance, or run. What if she'd been in on it? Should I run after all, get the job done, and leave the house without getting hurt? To think that we could both be the wrong kind of people and we'd both be living a life of bitterness and frustration. How would I go about that?</p> <p>I turned and followed my neighbor's dark form out into the backyard. We were both alone in the backyard so I took a chance. I walked down behind her and wrapped my arms around her, pulling her back against me. Her ass was on the edge of the pool. She was facing me and it was a delicious sight to watch her breasts bounce up and down as she walked. There was only one thing that was absolutely necessary now and that was to give my neighbor a chance to be alone with her. I leaned forward and licked her neck while I reached around her to her breasts.</p> <p>"What's this, little pet? Do you like what your neighbor is touching you?" she mumbled.</p> <p>I didn't respond. She'd never respond to that before. I could have told her to turn around and be my wife by now. That wasn't likely.</p> <p>"Do you want to feel what the good neighbor is feeling? Do you want to feel what my neighbor is feeling?"</p> <p>She didn't say anything. She was lost. She was having trouble making eye contact. I knew that if I got her alone and pressed my body into hers, I'd be able to do a lot better than that. She turned around, but my hands stayed out of the way and they still circled her breasts. The skin on skin contact was electric. It sent another shock through my body when we kissed. She moaned when she felt my hands caressing her breasts. I started to go lower again, to her soft hips. I didn't bother with more lube. I wanted to feel what was beneath the cloth and maybe even feel what would happen once I had her naked. I started pulling open her pussy lips. They weren't big enough. She didn't have any hair at all. I could just see, she had the whole lips of her pussy exposed.</p> <p>"So you like it, don't you. Is it good enough? Is this what your neighbor wanted?" I said it all to make her feel better before she answered. She just kept breathing and moaning while I spread her wide and licked her pussy lips. I didn't touch the clit for a minute or so. I just wanted to get her in the palm of my hand and then bury it in her pussy in a way she hadn't been in before. I was going to make her feel it.</p> <p>"Oh God!" she cried.</p> <p>I put my mouth at her and gave her a full on French kiss. I stuck my tongue in her mouth while I fondled her breasts and her ass. I was getting tired of holding her arms back and pressing them back against her body. She pulled them out from underneath her to let me slide out of her arms. I had to push hard into her body. She wrapped her legs around me.</p> <p>"Fuck!" she let out a breath.</p> <p>I held me body to hers. Our kiss deepened. Her pussy clenched me. Her body shuddered as I held her to me. Her breasts pressed against my chest and she arched her back slightly for my chest to grind against her. My lips were hot and wet. I wanted to devour her lips, her sweet breath, her body, everything.</p> <p>She pulled me by the hips until I got my cock into her pussy. Her body made up for that. My cock sank deeply into her and held it. In and out it went, we both let out a moan. When her body started to shake again, I started to slide into her again and she just let out a little moan.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels so good. Fuck me. Let me feel you. Fuck your neighbor. God I need to feel you." She said the things like, "Oh, soo good, yes. Fuck your neighbor! Fuck me now, you slut!"</p> <p>I thrust into her a few more times before I found her hips again. She wasn't going to pull away or anything. She just kept moving with me going. It was all I could do to hold myself back. She was so wet that I slipped right in. We were going to have a long fuck! Our mouths were locked together andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
