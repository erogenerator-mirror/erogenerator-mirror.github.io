They had taken a chance that they could be seen in the shadows.</p> <p>Karen turned around and faced the screen. “I'm going to watch that movie. You have to have a good time and if you do I will take full advantage of the view.” She smiled and leaned forward so their lips were together. They kissed and she ran one of her hands up and down his chest. “If you're a good boy, I’ll let you take full advantage of being naked in the dark.” She smiled and gave him a brief kiss. When she put her hands back down to the console, she reached down and unfastened her robe.</p> <p>“That's much better now,” he said as his penis pushed against her hips. He quickly pulled her to him and she was thrilled to be naked as he reached around and massaged her breasts, and massaged his own. She kissed him deeply and ran her hands down his chest and stomach. He had a small chest, almost nothing. She was pleased when she found a little lump that had to be the size of a coke can. His prick was soft and she wanted to feel it in her mouth when it came into view.</p> <p>They broke the kiss long enough to kiss and suck on each others tongues. Then Karen turned off the lights and took his hands in hers and placed them on the arms of the chair. “Take me upstairs and put me on the bed.”</p> <p>He was glad that no one was watching. He knew she wanted to be completely exposed and not to be ashamed. He kissed her slowly, lightly, teasingly, and she responded immediately. As soon as her lips parted on the first touch, she knew it would be okay. She felt his hot tongue probing her mouth and opening her vagina. His touch was gentle and there was no pressure, just the pressure of his lips.</p> <p>As she felt him kiss her and taste her, Karen closed her eyes, feeling the thrill of his body on hers. She felt the first tingles of excitement at the feeling of his hard penis pressing against her thigh. She moaned as he moved it up and down over the crotch of her panties. He pulled them off over her thighs so they would move between her legs. Her legs were warm and he moved up and started on her breasts again. She felt so good as his hand moved to stroke the length of her sex. He rubbed her clit through her panties, and she shuddered with excitement. He rubbed her clit with two fingers and slid a finger inside her vagina. He pushed inside, stretching her tight walls as he moved his lips down her body, down her stomach and up her vagina to press against her clitoris. “Oh yes," she cried. “Put a finger inside.” His finger moved over the small clit, and she came almost instantly. He stroked her, and when she started to arch her back under his touch, he knew that it was time to put his prick inside of her. He pushed gently in, pressing a little more now as she came back to him. He felt her tight vagina grip him as he entered her.</p> <p>The first time she had fucked a penis, she was sure that she could make herself cum that way. She was amazed that it had lasted this long. But, it still felt good. Her hands found hers and she moved them to touch his chest and find their rhythm. Their mouths were kissing again, and he slowly started moving himself against both breasts. The feel of their bare flesh moving together was wonderful. His hardness was pressing against the cleft of her vagina and he was aware of the warmth of her juices, which had seeped onto him, and he tried to keep up the momentum with his hands. Finally, he lifted his head and kissed her and she rolled over.</p> <p>At that moment, however, Karen noticed that her panties had come off and she raised a hand. She touched him, she touched him again, she began to masturbate. When she stopped, she looked down at his body and the sight of her masturbating was enough to set her off. They came together, in unison, shaking with pleasure. Their bodies were slick with sweat and they hugged and smiled. They kissed again.</p> <p>Karen looked in his face and saw the joy she had seen the first time in her dream. He looked down at her and she saw the same joy mirrored in her own eyes. They kissed again and he moved down to kiss her nipple. Then he leaned and kissed it. He kissed it again. She closed her eyes and ran her fingers through his hair.</p> <p>“Will I ever see you again? Will I want to marry her?” Karen's voice was full of—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
