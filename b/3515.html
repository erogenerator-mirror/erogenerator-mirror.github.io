I don't know how much of my own feelings I can tell.</p> <p>"You know we can't talk," I tell him.</p> <p>"So what is it that you wanna talk about?" He asks.</p> <p>"No, I'm not talking about anything. About myself. About you and my life. No, I'm not talking about anything at all. I'm just doing my job and that's all," I say, trying not to sound so desperate for him to listen.</p> <p>"I'm not angry with you, either, so don't worry about it," He's sympathetic.</p> <p>"Thanks for being there, I don't know what I'd do without you," I say to him, leaning up against his chest and wrapping my arms around my stomach before I reach his hands.</p> <p>"I guess it helps that I'm here, huh?" Daniel asks me.</p> <p>"Yes," I say. "Well, I'm not angry either. Just relieved, I guess." "I'd like to talk some more."</p> <p>"Sure. What can I get you?" I ask him. I know we can't talk on the phone for the rest of the evening. So how about it? "I could give you a lift home," I say, knowing that he would want to give me money, or to take me back to his truck before I'd leave. But I still want to tell him the truth about us.</p> <p>"No, I think we'll sleep in our room again tonight. I want to lay on the bed with you," Daniel says as he pulls his pants back on, and slides his shirt back on after buttoning up. He smiles and leans over, pulling me against his chest and we end the call before she can respond.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>After taking a deep breath and looking at each other one last time, I smile at Daniel and lift my arm. "Let's get out of here," I announce, pulling my phone from my waistband and picking up my bag along with my phone. "What?" He asks as his eyes widen in surprise.</p> <p>"You look so damn good up there..." is all I get out before he chuckles. "Is that true?" he asks, looking at his own eyes again.</p> <p>"I can't believe your hands..." I start, as Daniel leans in closer, trying to get his lips over mine. His hand is a little slow as he tries to get them on my lips, but once he does I open my mouth, moving my fingers into his hair to press his mouth against mine. His kiss is passionate and he presses his mouth firmly onto mine, slipping his tongue into me. He moans with pleasure as his hands start to slide down my body, over my blouse and down. He lifts me up, pressing the front of me against the door, and my eyes close in lust. His hands feel so good inside me, pushing into my jeans and brushing a hand along my skin as he lifts me from the pavement and sits down in the recliner, pulling me down onto him before I can protest. "What the..." he starts before he slides a hand under my bottom and slides the jeans down so he can get a hand full of my ass. But his leg is between mine and his hand is pressed against my clit, stroking it with a slow, steady motion. I can't stop moanings from escaping my lips as I'm so turned on. His fingers still inside me, making me cry out, so I grab his face and press against his lips with my own.</p> <p>I feel him move my shirt over my head in one hand and the button of my jeans with the other before he slides a hand inside my panties and lifts my ass up into his lap. This has to be the hottest thing I've ever felt in my life even with someone I hardly know! I can't keep quiet as my legs go around his waist to pull him as close as I can. I throw my arms around him and wrap them around his neck as I press myself against him.</p> <p>Daniel has his free hand under my shirt and is slowly moving it over my bare skin, rubbing his fingers over my clit, pushing it between us until I beg him to go faster. But he doesn't move until I have another orgasm, crying out as we kiss one at a time. Finally, he pulls up and kisses me, slipping his hand from my panties.</p> <p>"It's late, so we can get back," he whispers, kissing my cheek before he starts to straighten his pants. My pussy is still gushing from my second orgasm as my back is pressed back against the door after being used in as many ways that I can imagine. It's all I feel as he zips up and pushes himself awayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
