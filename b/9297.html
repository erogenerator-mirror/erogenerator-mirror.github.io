That's the best thing I've ever done," I said.</p> <p>"I'm glad. But don't do anything stupid like tell Mom and Dad that you want to, okay?" He said.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said. "But, before I go for my shower, can we ask you a question?"</p> <p>He looked at me again, his dark eyes still looking at me. I felt his eyes on me, his eyes burning a hot, painful fire. I didn't care. I felt my body relax and my heart sink. I'd always thought my life could be so fantastic until two nights ago. And since then? I can't imagine what that was, what it did to me. I had so much to thank God for for him.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "Anything you want me to say, okay?" He looked at me again and said: "I love you, too."</p> <p>"What?" I said, shocked, and felt like my entire body stiffened. Before I could say anything else, he'd grabbed my hand and pulled me upstairs to my bedroom. He dragged me in after me and tossed me down on the bed. Then he grabbed the bedspread and covered my eyes with it.</p> <p>"I...I love you," he said, standing over me.</p> <p>"I don't know what to say, I...but I'm so sorry I hurt you and I...and I'm so happy you're alright." I said.</p> <p>"What am I supposed to get back on the wagon?" he asked.</p> <p>"Are you alright?" I said. "You haven't been sleeping well tonight. My parents are going to kill me."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, baby," he said. "I guess I shouldn't have said that."</p> <p>"I feel bad that you broke up with me at the end of the night," I said. "But that night was the most fun I've ever had in my entire life! And I'm still here!"</p> <p>"It was the best sleep I ever had," he said. "And while you're at it, I'd like to tell you that when I came to make you my wife again I left your folks at your side. I didn't let them say they were wrong. I'd never let anyone do that to me again. I never thought you were worth it..." His speech faded to a distant, quiet, emotionless blur that I couldn't quite understand. I suddenly realized how I'd acted. I'd been afraid that I'd lost control and made the wrong choice. And I was angry about it. Oh, that's right, I'd been angry, too. He'd made the first move. I couldn't help myself, it was all too obvious.</p> <p>"I'm so tired," I said. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I did that to you. You weren't supposed to have been hurting me."</p> <p>"I wanted to hurt you, baby" he said, reaching for me.</p> <p>"But I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry," I said, laying my head on his chest.</p> <p>"Thank you?" he said. He put his hand on my cheek, stroking it lightly, and then he got up off the bed to sit next to me on the bed. He was looking through my eyelids, then turned them so I could see him. I took a deep breath, and smiled, and he stared at me again. The thought that he looked like he was just standing there staring at me was enough to make me want to throw the sheets off the bed and hug him. I thought about his chest, his eyes, his skin. I thought about his lips, his hands, his arms. I thought about his kisses, his hands, his voice, his voice.</p> <p>"You're just so beautiful," I said. "And I can't think of a nicer, more wonderful, guy." He smiled an affirmative smile.</p> <p>"Would you mind getting ready while I go shower," he said. "It's been a while. I love the clothes. That dress you had on tonight, the way that top was designed to show off your big belly," he said.</p> <p>"I thought it made you happy, too?" I said, reaching down and lifting the hem of my gown. He got off me again, and I quickly went to my knees to make sure of my position. I stood up, and took a deep breath and took a very deep breath, holding it for what felt like ages.</p> <p>"Do you want me to stop?" I said.</p> <p>"I love it," he said. "Just relax, okay?"</p> <p>I was still holding the hem of my gown very near my nipples when I felt him move my arms away.
