His kiss was warm, soft, and very gentle. A part of me wanted to turn away, but I couldn't. In a sense, it was very strange. I felt a bit guilty about what I had just done with John, and it was wrong on so many levels!</p> <p>"It's time to get my stuff. You may be my last guest, and you will not need this place again." He says kindly and with a kind smile. Then he turns and says a rather lame excuse about not wanting to get it late, and leaves.</p> <p>A minute later, another man, a handsome and quite well maintained male, I notice the same old men who had been there with me just a short time ago. I feel a blush at being called the 'oldies' in so many of those words. They all look at my feet, smiling with their eyes in the candle-light. I feel very silly for feeling this way, and I try to pull myself together, with more than a little help.</p> <p>Just as I finish, the door closes and the same old man is left, as the last guest leaves. The room is only two doors behind him, and he returns with a long handled wooden cane! It is a cane, he begins gently. "This might not seem all that bad" he says, "I only cane my patients with a cane and I don't really recommend it to you." I hear him say that very politely, but I can barely hear it. The cane is a very heavy black leather with sharp edges, which is almost like a long, thick cock cane. It stung as it passed over my arm. It felt strange. I felt myself shiver at the thought of how painful it might be.</p> <p>"There might be an exit-way through this door, you'll have to be quiet. You might have heard me tell you to keep your eyes down." He tells me. I notice my heart sinking, as I realize that I can not even get through the heavy wooden door! The sound of his cane hitting me almost makes me cry, as I feel it against my cheek. I feel the slight coldness as well as fear in my tears, as his words and the cane slide across my face.</p> <p>"Be very quiet" is all that escapes my lips. I am feeling all of this for once, as the feeling of safety I feel for this man is very strong for having a patient with him. I feel myself getting wetter and wetter, and I start sobbing as loud and hard as I ever have ever cried on a man, and in my whole life. The pain seems to grow and grow, as the tears begin to flow, and I don't even realize until then that I am crying. It seems so real, I feel like a real woman would by now, and that fear suddenly disappears.</p> <p>The fear is now starting to fade as my emotions slowly begin to subside. I start to get into a better frame of mind, and I can see myself from the window, looking at her and her family. I feel that she is still the beautiful and caring wife who lived in the house with the three others, and that is something I have always admired. She is so beautiful that I feel as though I could look at her forever, despite the fear I have had and the cane that I now know is not a cane.</p> <p>"Don't you stop crying", I hear her asking when I finally stop trembling. My tears start to run down my face, and I cannot see her at first. Suddenly the fear of something happening starts to fade, and then it is almost as though I was lost. I am back in the safety of my room, alone, and I take a long slow deep breath to try and calm myself, knowing that I must try not to take any more chances.</p> <p>I think back to what was done here last time, and my heart flutters and starts to race under my own fear as I remember what his smile and the cane had done to me. I know what it did, I know what he did to me, so I hope so. But what I am still afraid of, and I feel completely helpless, as I listen to my own heart beat and hear my own.</p> <p>When I can stand no more, I run a hand through my hair and sit at my desk, still naked and ashamed, but I am still so excited about this. As I begin to think about what I might do next, I feel the most wonderful feeling, as tears start to run down my cheeks. I can feel the wetness between my legs, but I want to do this, so I am ashamed of what is happening, and I hate myself for feeling that powerful feeling, and I never dreamed I would be the willing victim of such aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
