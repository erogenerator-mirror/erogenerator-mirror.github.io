Did I really do something? Did I just start with your ass? I am so sorry! So sorry! Do you have any idea who you're looking at?" I could hear the alarm in his voice. He seemed to sense that this was not just about his sex! He quickly turned and walked out to the patio door. "Please, can we talk in one more second, please? I'll do anything please?" I did not hesitate to stand up immediately.</p> <p>"All right, honey. I'll tell him what you did and why if he does right. But don't be too long, honey. I want to see you and see how nice you can make me feel." I said.</p> <p>I was on my feet in five feet of water, looking for the glass window, when the doorbell rang. I ran towards the front window and opened it wide to see who was there, before I stepped outside. The man was standing on the side of the driveway in an old housecoat, that must have been his son's. He looked up at me like I was a crazy woman; I was still in my running clothes. It took him a couple seconds to recognize me because his heart was pounding rapidly. He moved towards me, I didn't know if he knew I was standing or not but I couldn't move as he approached.</p> <p>"You know I'm trying to be nice, but I can see that you are very attractive," I said, staring at his bulging trousers, "Why don't I take this one upstairs and take it right off, while you fix your hair?" He was a handsome young man, about seven years old. He had long blonde hair that cascaded down his back, about halfway down his chest. The hair is long, as I had learned, and he wore long, baggy pants as he walked me up the stairs.</p> <p>"What's that thing? Is my hair too long, or short?" He looked down at me with one eyebrow raised. It made me even more nervous.</p> <p>I was standing in the bath with my arms hanging open, exposing my entire body. "Oh, it is long, and it's beautiful," I said.</p> <p>He walked over to me and took my hands in his, and held them, with one hand while he kissed my lips tenderly. I could feel his lips on mine, then the tip of his tongue. Our kiss went on for a minute and I thought he was going to say something, so I just held on tighter not to hurt him. He finally let go of my hands and let go of my mouth, which was too tight. He grabbed his shirt off and threw it on the pool deck, revealing his muscular arms and chest. His shirt looked very good on him, I didn't think the hair was that short, but it must be a little over an inch long. He looked much older than I remembered, and he didn't look to much younger than his age, maybe in his mid-twenties.</p> <p>He pushed me up against the wall and started to kiss me again, but this time really was a bit more intense. When his tongue pushed between my lips it was the most erotic experience of my life. We stood like that for a few seconds, then he said, "Do you know your birthday is next weekend? I just want to give you a surprise. I was really hoping you would give me your birthday present." He kissed me again, then he said, "I hope you will give me a gift very soon, now that we are all standing this time." I could not believe it! He was in my bedroom kissing me and I couldn't tell why. He must have planned it all along.</p> <p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you your birthday," I said, trying to explain to him about the surprise that I was about to see him give me.</p> <p>He looked me deeply in the eyes and said, "Oh, don't worry about it. I'm sure you can't be disappointed. I want to be your firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
