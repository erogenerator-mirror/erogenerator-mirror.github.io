You can trust us with all that you want, with all that that we want, with what you have left, and you want to take that much in."</p> <p>I know he said it, I could feel it. I'd never felt him talk like this. He took my hand again. We stood there, hands at the edge. He didn't wait for me to start to walk away, and when I didn't, he pulled me to him and kissed me on my lips. He kissed me like the world would end. "I didn't think it would help," he said.</p> <p>"Don't change. You can go back to what he did to you, if you want," I said. "He had a great chance to help. The things he said that I should be doing to me aren't helping." I couldn't tell him that. I didn't want him to hurt me, either. And what he put me through was beyond anything I'd ever done, and there was more than that. It was over. We could see it when we saw the way he was looking at me. He loved me, and I loved him.</p> <p>There was a lot more to it than that. But, it was still all I ever wanted to think, and I was glad we did. He put his arms around me and kissed me again, and I felt like a woman again. I loved the way he pulled me into his arms and held me tight, our lips never breaking their contact. And there aren't many people who love their children more than me. I had never known this. It would be impossible. But, I knew, I could never go back to what Jim had done to me. I could never ever, even at the thought that he might be able to, would have the same desire for me that he did. If he was capable of doing all those things, there was no way I could think of another way.</p> <p>I could tell by the look in his eyes, and the small beads of sweat on his brow and back that he was ready, and I knew what he wanted. What I needed to see, I knew. I reached down to the front of my pants and pulled my zipper down, and pulled on my pants until I could slide them down, all the way down to my ankles. Then I stepped out of them, and pulled them from my shoes, and kicked them aside as soon as I hit the floor. I stood in front of him clad only in my shirt, panties, socks and bra, while he sat back against the sofa and stared at me. His eyes were dark and intense, and I loved that. I pulled my socks off, too, and put them on the floor, and stood in front of him. I stood there for a moment, just staring at the eyes in the dark. I wanted him to see me, to know that he was going to be with me. There was no way I would have made the decision about that, but there was one thing I was going to do. I was going to take him. I walked right over to him in my socks.</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed him on the mouth, running my tongue along his lower lip. He put one hand on top of my head to guide me. But, he stopped me.</p> <p>"Let's not be so bold," he said. "I think you want this, anyway. And you know that you're right, you still have a boyfriend, right?" He looked at the floor for a second, as if he would say so many things, but he just stared at me like I was a new person who had just been shown how to be desirable. Then he pulled me into his arms. "Come on," he said, "let's take a shower, ok?" And I knew that if we got in the shower, I wouldn't say no to him right away. I didn't have a choice but to trust him.</p> <p>And I did. I had had plenty of time to think on it, and it occurred to me, as I stood there, naked, just inches from his fully naked body, that somehow, I just knew I wasn't going to let this thing pass me by. But, I knew that he wanted this as much as I did, and that if this was what he wanted, then it was all right for us to have sex, so long as it was with him, or not having, together. Jim had been a good lover, and I could see that he had been a good lover too, but I wanted to see it really, really, really. For myself, not for Jim. For tonight, we were going to take it slow, for tonight, and for the rest of ourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
