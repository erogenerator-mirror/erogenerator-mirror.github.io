He was smiling, but he didn't take my hand. I thought about being left alone.</p> <p>We were walking the half of the block. "Where are we?" I asked.</p> <p>"We're in a secluded grove. The only shade you're going to get tonight is in the trees. We're going to do some more hiking in the park or somewhere in the woods." He said and got up from the bench he was on. He pulled his shirt off, throwing it aside, and got down on his knees. His body looked hard, his muscles seemed to go on forever. His cock was hard, maybe even harder.</p> <p>My hands went to his head and squeezed it as I started to suck on his shaft. His taste of his pre-cum was so amazing. I took his balls into my mouth one at a time and sucked it gently. Then I would squeeze his cock and play with his nuts while I ran the tip of my tongue along his shaft. He was enjoying my tongue as much as I was but there was something else. "Can I show you something?" He asked and I could only nod. When he stood up I saw he had a tattoo on his thigh, "See what it was?"</p> <p>I laughed and said, "Is it a dragon?"</p> <p>He laughed and said, "Yes, you should see it now." We headed out and he pulled me close and asked, "You want to show me something?"</p> <p>"Yeah." I said and we walked into the wood. I stood still, waiting for him to take me. He looked up at me and asked, "What does it do with you?"</p> <p>He grabbed my chin and brought my head to him and looked at me. His eyes were so dark, I don't think I could read them but they sent an image of love and lust in my mind. It was alluring and he pulled me closer to him, putting his lips on the side of my face for me to kiss him on my lips. All he was going to do is take control but I had no intention of stopping him.</p> <p>"Is that really real?" No answer so I kept kissing him. His body was hot yet soft to the touch on my skin. I took off my shirt but let him do the rest. His hands were warm and hard so close to my back.</p> <p>"Do you like this?" I nodded. I leaned down to look into his eyes and nodded again. He reached up to run his hands through my hair.</p> <p>"Turn around." I turned and faced him, our faces were inches apart. My eyes were on fire as his eyes devoured me. I could feel how hot it made me. My hands ran all over him with all the passion I could get from him. I had wanted him in my mouth when he came to my house. He didn't disappoint me and it took me awhile to get him back into it. I wanted him so much that I was desperate to touch him.</p> <p>"Is it real?" He asked. I nodded.</p> <p>"Yes it is and if you want to show me something else, I have something in mind." We both laughed at that but his eyes were on fire with excitement. I was shaking.</p> <p>"Take off your pants. Your panties too." He took his hands off my head and I nodded again so he pulled them off over my legs, stepping out of them. Then he took his hands off my dick and moved back to me. My hand found its way to his back and I ran my hands across his body again. I kissed him gently this time, feeling him pull me closer and run his tongue along my lips. I heard him moving behind me, putting his hands at the tops of our legs. I turned my head back to look as he spread me out for him. I had never felt something that big before and his cock was pushing me from behind.</p> <p>"Is it ok?" He asked as he pushed the head of his cock between my cheeks. I could feel it rubbing hard against my hole and I said, "it's fine." He said as he pushed inside of me. I felt so full. I knew I would do anything if he would just keep going slow.</p> <p>"You feel so tight." He pushed in and out of me. All the feelings I'd felt at the wedding seemed to be driving me wild. His hands were on my butt cheeks, pulling them apart. He was working his cock in and out of me, getting me ready for him. I felt like I would burst. "Don't stop." I was breathless, my body was tense and I loved knowing we both enjoyed each other so much. As I was close to the edge I pulled away and kissed his neck and chest and belly. He didn't touch me this time but I felt him start toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
