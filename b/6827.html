Anything in particular?"</p> <p>She smiled up at me and slowly moved a hand on my leg.</p> <p>"I always wished I could. But I can't. It seems like so many guys seem to have that thing they want to do but can't."</p> <p>I turned my head to the back and kissed her again while she moved her hand a little farther up my leg. I pulled my cock out of my jeans and rubbed it against her cheek. She turned and kissed me for a moment, then turned back to the kitchen.</p> <p>"Don't forget your underwear," she said as I helped her out of the house.</p> <p>"Hurry. I need your help," I smiled.</p> <p>"I'll always remember."</p> <p>We kissed, deeply and lovingly and then went to the bedroom. We spent the remainder of the afternoon making out and petting and sucking each other into another hard climax before coming back to take a shower together.</p> <p>That evening, we had a delicious dinner, a meal that I could eat. I felt great, a really great feeling and didn't care that we kept the house in order. It made me happy to know that our neighbor was doing her husband well and that we were good together againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
