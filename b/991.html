I put it back on her, but this time she looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"Where do ya think you're going, lover? Don't we have the house to ourselves?"</p> <p>"You know where I'm going," I said, "Let me go with you."</p> <p>With that, she put her arms around me and kissed me on the mouth, running her tongue and lips over my mouth and down to my cock, then sliding her tongue against my teeth. I pushed my tongue further into her mouth, massaging it with mine. We kept kissing and licking each other for a few moments then pulled back.</p> <p>"I want this to last a bit longer," she said breathily. "I've never felt so good before in my life." She raised her eyebrows; "I think I'm enjoying this more than I thought I would, but you have to give me one more minute to get ready, honey."</p> <p>"OK," I said, then stepped toward her and slid my hands up and down her back. I slipped my hand down to her waist, then slowly slid it into the hem of her robe. I could feel her pussy when I slid my hand along it. I felt her skin. She was smooth and warm and damp against my fingers and arm. Her tits were large and firm. I put my other hand around her back and slid back down, pressing my middle finger against her pussyhole, then back up and down. I could feel the shape of her pussy lips through the tiniest of knickers. I stroked her back down to the hem of her robe.</p> <p>"God, it feels so good," she said, taking my hand from her chest and running both of hers over the fabric covering her chest. I ran the middle of the fingers of my left hand over her right nipple, then down the underside of her tit and back up over the lace of her bra. She pulled the lace up so it rested on her tit, then reached back and undid the hooks. I slid my left hand under her robe and down the front of her body until it rested between her legs. I felt the lips of her pussy lips, the cleft that separates the tops of her legs. I slid a finger down there, then found her clit. I slipped my finger along the length of her wet pussy, pressing against it. There were a few bumps, but most remained the same.</p> <p>"Oooohh. That's so damn good," she said. I slid my middle finger between the lips of her pussy and probed it gently, then slowly slid it back and forth along her slit. "You're so wet. Feels so good." she said. I pressed my middle finger more firmly against her clit as I finger fucked her. I slid a second finger into her pussy as my right hand still stroked her tit.</p> <p>We stopped kissing as her fingers returned to her own tits and her head fell back again as she felt the pleasure that only this was taking place between her legs. I slid my middle finger up and down a finger that had been well fucked by my girlfriend for the last hour or so. I looked down and saw that it was hard for her to keep her balance. I slid my finger from her pussy and slid it up and down her body. I slid my thumb along her cuntlips and back down toward her clit. I slid my fingers to her lips, then felt around for her G-spot there. My middle finger found it first, then my hand. She shivered, then took a couple of gasping breaths as she felt the pressure release there. I slid my middle finger back to the top of her body, then slid it down her body slowly.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels so good!" she said. The pressure in her cunt came back with a vengeance. As I slid my two fingers around her pussy, I could feel the hard ridge of her clit on the way in and back out. Each time it came, I gently squeezed her clit with my thumb.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. It feels so good, honey."</p> <p>"God, I love being your girl!"</p> <p>I slipped my thumb inside of her and pressed it harder against her clit. Her hips rocked up against my hand even as I pulled my fingers away. She didn't say anything for a minute, then started kissing me again as she moved my hand back to her tits. She looked at me with her eyelids still half-closed, then lifted her mouth from mine and began kissing me, first all the while, then pulling her mouth from mine and taking herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
