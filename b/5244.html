That's how I feel when I feel like this.</p> <p>He grabbed my hips and pulled me toward him hard, his cock sliding in with his hands as my back bowed. "Don't worry, Baby," he murmured, "I love you . . . just be yourself. I love you," and he thrust in. I was all his, and I loved.</p> <p>I came a couple minutes later, almost screaming. He felt it and he thrust into me a second time. My eyes snapped open just as he had the first. His eyes were wild and open, looking right at me. I felt proud as I came. We started talking, but I think we forgot about talking for a couple minutes. In the end, he asked me if I had ever fucked a girl, and I told him yes. He asked me if I had ever had a girl's breasts. I told him I had . . .</p> <p>"Your breasts are magnificent," he said. "So beautiful." I had never felt anything like them, and I almost had my first kiss with someone I had just met, and it felt like we were all sharing an intimate moment.</p> <p>My breasts were so full and sensual it made my nipples stand to attention under her top, and I think I even moaned a little, just like her. "Have you ever had a girl suck your nipples?" he asked me.</p> <p>"No, but I think I've had a lover's mouth, too," I told him. Then I kissed her again with more urgency and, "Mmm, that feels so good." He went down on her breast and then put his mouth there, giving her a soft, sucking kiss that made my pussy flow with desire.</p> <p>My eyes closed as he sucked and kissed. It felt wonderful. I couldn't get enough of it. "Yes, Honey. Eat my tits, Baby. Give me your tongue, Baby."</p> <p>He started sucking her. It was so smooth and exciting and just so good. I couldn't believe that I had gotten so much pleasure by having him suck my body. I don't know if anything had ever felt like that before. I was about as excited as he was. I looked up at him, and it almost made me come again. He was a handsome, sexy and so handsome! What more could a girl ask for?</p> <p>He came up for air and gave me a long loving kiss. He leaned over and kissed me on the cheek and I smiled, knowing that I had been the center of his pleasure.</p> <p>"I love you, Baby," he said.</p> <p>He was a handsome and sexy man. It was a joy to think he was all that I wanted, because I knew I loved him.</p> <p>"Well, my dear, your breasts are so beautiful and delicious," I said. "They feel great in my hands." Our conversation had gotten so personal; there was no need to discuss our private little secrets, to just get each other off.</p> <p>"Yes, dear," he replied. "Your breast feels magnificent. And I love your nipples." His words aroused my desire in a way that he had not. He looked up and gave me his patented smirk.</p> <p>He reached for a bottle of sopranos that a man might use on their dates and set it on the counter in front of the microwave. He looked at me, then lifted his shirt to show me all his delicious, shapely, muscled arms and his beautifully muscular chest.</p> <p>"You're looking good, too, my pretty, sweet," I said. He bent up and kissed me.</p> <p>He kissed me for almost a minute, and every little motion I made made his manhood, even through his jeans, grow ever harder. He kissed and tongued me all the way down to my nipples, and then he kissed and kissed it, licked it with his tongue. He kissed and licked all the way down to my little nub. My hands were all over him as he worked on me. My whole body was twitching with desire and I could feel my pussy throbbing. I had made noises that he had never heard. He wanted to please me, too. But he was too shy to kiss again, I thought.</p> <p>My nipples felt like they were in a vice. I wanted to pull his face down to mine, to take it right there on the kitchen floor, to suck and bite them, to put my hands under their hair and pull on it. I wanted that tongue all the way down to my clit. But he kept working me, then, his lips and his tongue. It was a little tickle.</p> <p>He lifted my legs and hooked them over his shoulders, and I started feeling that great feeling in my belly. It kept getting bigger and bigger.
