I just wish it was before."</p> <p>Gretchen was shocked that she was making such an expression, and that it was possible that their relationship had only just begun. "If I would have known about you and your wife the other day, I would have never allowed you to feel like that."</p> <p>"It's been a long time. And it has been amazing. You have no idea, just how amazing."</p> <p>"You mean so many things to me." She said, her voice suddenly taking on a little edge. "Like if we were to give you a blowjob."</p> <p>"If you thought it would be so good..."</p> <p>"I wanted to suck your cock, but it's not right to take advantage of a woman. You're my slut and I love making love, and we can make it a long day." She gave him a pouting look.</p> <p>When she saw the hurt he had in his tone, she knew he meant what she said.</p> <p>"Well, if you ever want to cum, then it's your decision." And even if it did not occur to him that she wanted to blow him, it was worth trying to give him something, anytime or anywhere.</p> <p>The way his voice lit up when Gretchen said that. It was as if he got a little naughty, and made her want to do. It also made her nervous that it was a long time without even being able to do anything. His face turned to an expression he didn't recognize, and he smiled that smile that had such a soft affect on her. "If you ever want a blowjob from me, I will be willing."</p> <p>Gretchen's words made her feel like she could stay angry with him, but even worse, just hearing his words made her want to have a taste of his cock. And now, he was only joking, she realized. She wanted him more.</p> <p>"Yes... You can."</p> <p>"I just need a little help." She said, and then her body moved toward him, almost crawling onto it. Her tongue darted out to lick around the head of his cock as she bent down, licking his balls. Gretchen didn't think she had ever gotten to where she was before, but she had only ever licked another man.</p> <p>The first load of semen came from the end of his dick, the second jet hit the back of her mouth. She didn't really enjoy it, and even though that didn't stop her, she didn't particularly like the taste, just that she had gotten away with it.</p> <p>Gretchen moved her tongue over his cock, letting it glide around a few more times before she opened her mouth and took it in. She did not really have time to enjoy him, so when it was all in her mouth, she closed her lips around it again and sucked down into her body, drawing him to her throat.</p> <p>Once she got him inside her, she did not stop after sucking him for long enough to really enjoy the taste. She knew he wasn't going to take any of that, so she didn't even attempt pulling him out of her mouth. Maybe she did because she didn't want to, but she only got out of the way because he wouldn't be able to have. They both knew that, because it was now completely out of her control.</p> <p>Gretchen began sucking harder as she became more aggressive in her efforts. Just as she was going wild on his shaft, his hands shot out and grabbed her head, holding her to him as he started pushing himself deeper. He fucked her mouth with his cock, but she knew better than to move fast. The feeling of his cock hitting the back of her throat like a piston was amazing, but she didn't want him to orgasm just yet.</p> <p>Gretchen kept her mouth open so she could taste her own cum, so she could feel how nice his load was compared to what he was going to do to her when he was done. The sight of his long dick as he watched it slide in and out of her mouth brought her pussy to that point where she would cum again.</p> <p>But, she didn't want him to cum. She knew it was too good of a time. She wanted him to cum in her mouth, and she knew she could just go to her own bedroom and beg him to fuck her, but not yet. She wanted to feel his cock fucking her ass, but now it was time. She grabbed his cock with one hand so he would come to mind, and slid the slippery head across her pussy. She could feel how wet she was from sucking his cock, and she knew her own juices were starting to run down her legs.</p> <p>She felt the tightness in her cunt start to build, feeling it run down her legs as she beganâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
