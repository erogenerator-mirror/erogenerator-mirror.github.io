I explained to her as she tried to pull away.</p> <p>"No, I think that would be very good. No. You need to tell the truth. You need to tell all of this and you need to really tell me everything and everything I have ever wanted to hear." She said as she moved closer to me. "Ok? No turning back." She spoke quickly as I could feel her trying to calm herself. "That wasn't your choice of words."</p> <p>"What is my choice if you can't tell me about being locked up, I'm sure I can come up with some interesting and interesting new way of talking about you." I stated as she backed away a little more. "There is nothing to say now." She spoke as I looked back. "If you must know, you'll either be in jail or on the street and you will probably be walking home alone." She spoke as she turned to me and pushed back to her bedroom. "Ohhh, I love this! Just tell me."</p> <p>She was trying for the right tone, the one that just said it all. I was not sure if it was her or her imagination but I knew that what she was doing to me was really getting things rolling and I liked and enjoyed it. "Ok, I just said I wanted to know if I could live with myself just telling you what I am about to do to you, so you would know it wasn't just a game or a fling." I told her as she sat on the bed. "Just tell me what the game is and have him tell you or don't tell me." The more she talked, I was getting hard and feeling very excited by her words.</p> <p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly and leaned back. "I got carried away a little bit, I guess so I couldn't really explain it." I told her as I stood back.</p> <p>"The game you told me about was about whether you would be able to live that lifestyle." I knew my face was still red, but I could not do anything about it. "I told you that I wouldn't try to change anything until you told me about it and that you had to tell me if you wanted to. There isn't anything more I can teach you without all of the reasons you are going to have to give." She said as she held her head up waiting to hear my response. I leaned back again and took a deep breath. "I will try to be as honest as I can because I don't want your opinion or what you think I have to say for myself, you have to let me know and I will be back and tell you what I feel and think about you." I said as I looked at her in front of me.</p> <p>"Ok, I don't see why it doesn't seem to be a big deal to both of us, but if it does." She spoke as she sat on the bed next to me. "I can't do that now. I just don't know if I want to be that way for a while. I can't make a decision like this right now, but I don't have that choice now, and that isn't saying anything. You are going to have to decide whether you want to go back, so to speak or have him tell you that he doesn't like it. It would really help us both." she said looking into my eyes. "I will take the two of you to the doctors. You can start by telling me your feelings and if or if you decide you would rather be there and not know how you feel about the whole thing. The first thing you are going to tell me will be when you're with him and who he is. The first thing you are going to tell me is which day it is if he is your favorite lover. There aren't any other things to tell you."</p> <p>"I won't tell you anything." I said as I watched her face intently. "You can tell me now or you can tell me tomorrow, but just tell me when you're with him and I will answer what you tell me." She spoke as her eyes turned a darkening light against the white dress she had on. "You have to talk to me, I don't know if you can, but if you can, you can tell me the truth." I spoke as I waited for her to tell me.</p> <p>"I want to be with him." I told her as I stood up and walked away from her. I could see the shock and fear in her eyes as she took in her words. "He won't be with me tonight. He will just be in my living room when he comes out of the store. What is your problem?" She held herself very still for me and I just watched herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
