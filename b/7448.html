I did. And I liked it. But my heart stopped. And when we talked about the things we wanted him to have...he looked in your eyes and he was like, 'I don't want to make up,' and I'm like, 'I love the sounds that come from him in my ear, too,'" she said, shaking her head slowly.</p> <p>"So you were going to give it to him..." I said, and then she did too, and I didn't bother to stop her.</p> <p>We lay there, and I held her, and she put her arm around me, and I held her as well. We held each other for a long time, trying to decide whom to go with first. Finally, she thought, but didn't push it. "I'll go with you."</p> <p>We sat on the bed, and she ran her hand through my hair, "I don't know why I said you can't give him a proper blowjob," she said.</p> <p>"Don't tell me that," I said.</p> <p>"It's really too bad, that you like it," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe," I said. "I was a little afraid that he would hurt you in the next little while."</p> <p>"I don't blame you for letting him have you," she said.</p> <p>"Do you, too?"</p> <p>"Definitely," she said with a smile.</p> <p>I got up and picked her up a little closer, and we went into her bedroom, still holding each other tightly in our arms. When we were inside, I kissed her, and we lay facing each other on her bed. She put her legs on either side of me, so mine were around her waist, and we kissed, and I reached down to unbutton her shirt and then my mouth to hers, and she opened and I undid her pants, and we both let them fall to her ankles, then we undressed. I kissed my way down her neck, and her chest, and she sighed, but I never said anything to her.</p> <p>I kissed her breasts, which are large, and I kissed them and her eyes and her nose, and I licked and kissed it and her face and her chin, and she took my face in her hands and kissed me. When I came it on her face, she did the same to me, and when I felt her nipples harden under my kisses and her hands on my cheek she turned my face towards hers.</p> <p>We lay like that while we kissed and explored and we kissed and kissed and I rolled her on top of me, and I felt her pussy on me and I felt the head of each of the four large dildos, and I felt a tingle as I felt them enter her. The first one was still in there, and I knew that it could go in and stuff it up her. She was holding it up against herself as I looked around it and put it in her, and I felt it go in and out a little as I put it to her. One more thing that I didn't notice but soon realized was that my penis was in her when she raised herself up, and when I saw that she was taking the dildos all the way inside her, I got hard.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck him," she said, and she put up a smile and sat up a little. I looked at her, and the look on her face was intense.</p> <p>"You want me do that to you?" I said.</p> <p>"Yeah. You know..." she said as she was pulling off my pants, and she got my socks off, and then got it off with hers. "Let me get it on for you. It'll feel just right."</p> <p>I smiled and lay down on the bed, and she climbed on me, but then she got a condom out of her nightstand—a little one. It was smaller than the ones we used for me to hold our sex, and I wanted to feel everything inside me before it was time for her to go and come on me.</p> <p>She got between my legs, and she opened them, and then she put the head of her cock right up to my hole and I felt it slide inside, and I was so wet it slid right in with a pop. She was pushing the way forward, and I took more of her and felt the feeling that other dildos had on me, and I wanted her in all the way. She leaned forward and I felt the tingle when her pubic hair pressed against me and the head was rubbing my pussy. She started to fuck me slowly as I felt the dildos go in and out and the head of her shaft rub my pussy lips and her clit, and the dildos going in and out as she fucked me with them.</p> <p>It was a good feeling—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
