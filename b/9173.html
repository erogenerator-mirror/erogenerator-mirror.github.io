You're so soft, so warm!" his lips were on her ear.</p> <p>"Mmmmm! You feel so great on me!"</p> <p>"Mmmfff! You feel soooo good," she said.</p> <p>"I don't want to get back out this way."</p> <p>"Don't move!"</p> <p>Carrie lifted off him so she wasn't straddling him. He turned on his side and kissed her, "You're going to love this," he told her.</p> <p>They kissed lightly for several seconds before she slowly began to move toward his chest. When he lifted his head, Carrie was between his legs. Slowly but passionately, she kissed up and down his leg. As she reached his hard penis, she sucked it in, moving it slowly in and out.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhh," he sighed, feeling her tongue slide over the head. He raised his leg, bringing it to the center of the bed. She took the tip of it in and slid her tongue up and down.</p> <p>"Mmm! Suck me!"</p> <p>Carrie continued to suck him, her hand working him hard in her mouth. The feeling of pleasure overcame him and his penis got harder than it ever was.</p> <p>"I'm going to come!"</p> <p>"Don't hold back, baby. Cum for me!"</p> <p>She was already on her knees, sucking when he thrust forward and released, his seed running down her throat. The warmth was overwhelming as he pushed all the way in her mouth with one last moan. Carrie swallowed it all, letting it linger between her tongue and lips. It wasn't a massive load but it left most of it in her stomach. Carrie continued licking him, as he began to soften.</p> <p>"Did you like that?"</p> <p>Carrie smiled up at him as he lay there. She had never felt so alive, knowing that she had made a man hard and he enjoyed it.</p> <p>"It was wonderful! I've never done anything like that before, even when I was with my girlfriends."</p> <p>"I think you did a good job." She looked up at him. "Thank you."</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed her. "Do you have any friends that you would like to do this again?"</p> <p>"I've been thinking about that night."</p> <p>"Well, we have a lot of time before we can do anything else."</p> <p>"What are you waiting for?"</p> <p>"I have a little more time to think about this."</p> <p>"I know, but tonight is special, it's my night and you're my man. I'll be there cheering on you."</p> <p>"I'll be more than ready. It's your night."</p> <p>"I was kind of curious to see the city," she said.</p> <p>"Well, we'll see," he responded, rising up from the bed and turning to go to his dresser.</p> <p>Carrie was on her knees, working herself up and down his hardness as her hand worked him toward release. She got the idea and slid both his hands up and along her sides, causing his skin to touch her wherever they touched. Their mutual caresses became more insistent and urgent as he pushed her up against the brass headboard.</p> <p>"Oh baby," she whispered, her mouth wet and her eyes half lidded. "We really like this."</p> <p>"That's right, love," he answered as he lifted her off him and lay next to her. "I never knew how much fun it would be to watch you have sex with somebody new."</p> <p>"Me neither!" she giggled. "It was pretty good."</p> <p>"It has been for me. Even with you."</p> <p>"And me," she added.</p> <p>"And me," he agreed. "But we didn't have sex all that much. I felt like we were making new memories. I loved being able to watch you make love to someone else."</p> <p>"I do, too," she said. "And I loved it."</p> <p>"I know. And that was a lot!"</p> <p>Carrie squeezed his arm and kissed his hand. After a few minutes, they got out of bed and moved into the sitting room. She took a bottle of wine and poured two glasses. "What do we do?" she asked.</p> <p>"I think we should go to the movie."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>As Carrie sat down in the chair, he turned to the large sofa nearby. "Would you mind waiting?" he asked.</p> <p>"Not at all," she told him. "You can sit and let me enjoy it. What do you think?"</p> <p>"I'm willing to sit and watch though."</p> <p>"Just give me a minute."</p> <p>"I'm going to turn on the stereo.
