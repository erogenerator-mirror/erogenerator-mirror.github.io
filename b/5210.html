I want... to touch you," I finally managed to utter, after another moment of awkward silence.</p> <p>With my left hand on his hard shaft, I reached up with my right one and began stroking him. I could feel his heartbeat starting to quicken in his balls and the head of his cock was glistening with pre-cum. I pulled up just enough to have my nose just above the glistening shaft, and then used both hands to stroke him up and down. His hand came up to take several slow strokes on and off my cock, in and out, back and forth and in a circle. I could feel his shaft becoming rigid. He was moaning quietly, with each of his strokes becoming more frantic. I was not aware of his other hand moving down between us until I could feel it brushing my balls.</p> <p>"Mmm," I exhaled in a rush.</p> <p>He let go of my cock, and it sprung back up.</p> <p>"Oh, my," I heard him say, almost out of breath.</p> <p>"I really want this", I replied, in the most intimate way I could.</p> <p>When I took him as into my mouth and started to suck as hard as if I was going to devour him, he let out a loud moan.</p> <p>"Oh, God," he sighed, his hips beginning to jerk in time with my hands still stroking his cock.</p> <p>"Keep going", I whispered into his ear, and he did so. When his ass moved forward, with his legs bent and his feet in the air as well as his ass in the air, I began pulling down on him.</p> <p>"Mmm...yes, baby," he replied as I pulled up on him and moved down again.</p> <p>It was a surreal experience, not just because we were kissing, but because we were having sex right in front of the camera. There was no way I was going to let this end before I knew it. I didn't have to worry about it if we couldn't do this by ourselves. If he wanted to do this with anyone else, I was going with him. If he just didn't think he had to get involved with me, then no harm was done. The thought of the camera on its tripod at this point was more than enough stimulus.</p> <p>I moved one hand back up to rub around my head while the next I slowly rubbed my thumb against my lips. I was trying to put on a show for it, as I slowly drew the tips of my fingers up, and slid them down, in and out over and over as I watched him.</p> <p>It was a strange mix of sexual stimulation, an intense pleasure to me. I was sure of the fact that I loved masturbating when we were in that kind of setting. I imagined that it was my own fingers doing it.</p> <p>"I want you to come in my mouth," I whispered, after a few moments.</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm," he responded, and I knew he wanted me to. I was not so sure if I wanted to, at least not right away. After all, it only made sense to him if I wanted to give him a "blowjob", right before we had sex. If he was having trouble holding himself back, I decided to just let him fuck my mouth and watch.</p> <p>I began to stroke his shaft again, and he started humping his hips back toward me. I kept my hand on his balls while I sucked hard on him, and felt them tighten up against either side of my mouth. It was a small sign of what he wanted, though, and in a way I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted us to end this before things had begun. I wasn't sure if I wanted to lose control.</p> <p>"Oh, God," he moaned as I sucked.</p> <p>I pushed his legs back, so that he was almost resting on the couch. I slid my right hand back down the length of his shaft, and was now gripping his balls firmly as I took his head deeper into my mouth and down my throat. "Come on, baby," I said, as I began to move my hand back and forth on his balls and cock. I could feel them tightening up in my hands and could also feel the warmth starting to spread from my own hands up through to my hands.</p> <p>"Oh, God," he said with a muffled moan, as his hips pushed forward again. His ass began to jiggle a little, and I could feel the head of his cock against the back of mine.</p> <p>"Come on," I whispered, moving my lips up and down on him as he humped back to face me.</p> <p>"I want you to come all over my face," I whisperedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
