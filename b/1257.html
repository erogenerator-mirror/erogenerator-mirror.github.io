Maybe you will do me a favour?" She replied, looking into my eyes with her big blue eyes. Without a word, I leaned forward to kiss her mouth, her cheeks and lips. She responded, opening her lips slightly so that I could give her a taste. I kissed her lips again, tasting my own juices and her saliva as it mixed with her lipstick. Again, she started to kiss me as my penis pressed against her ass. She placed her hand on my thigh and began stroking my penis as our embrace deepened. Her tongue pressed on my lips, trying to join with mine. We were both moaning and breathing hard as we kissed. I ran my hand up over her breast. She shuddered a little and pressed against me while I teased her nipple. I broke our kiss and looked into her eyes, she smiled before pushing me away and walking toward the door.</p> <p>"Not now," she said. "I have been waiting all night to get the opportunity to make love to you." She smiled as she disappeared down the hallway. I turned my attention towards Ashley, who looked over and laughed. We both started walking toward the bedroom. I held my hand out toward her, Ashley took it. "Here," she said, placing me on the bed beside her. "I have thought about how I want to be taken. It seems like so special. It is for you, but not for me." I had started to feel a little nervous, Ashley's confidence in our relationship had been the reason I had not been able to make the commitment to her. But since we had made it clear from the start that I was not coming to the marriage, it seemed that I could be counted on to get what I wanted.</p> <p>"I want this too if it has the chance to be with anyone." Ashley spoke up. "It's just that I have had some bad experience before..." She shrugged. "But the sex is good." She said smiling.</p> <p>I smiled back, giving her my best look. "I have been with lots of guys. I have also had some fun, but not as much as I wanted." I looked down into Ashley's eyes. "Do you want me to go first?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just wait. I have been thinking about for a while about what you said. As much as I want to feel you pressing against me as you cum deep inside me. That is if I can, I know you will." Ashley replied.</p> <p>I smiled. I could not believe how forward she was, how willing she was to do this. I thought for a while. "I have always wanted to try it with a woman. I had thought about you all the time I was going through puberty all that time." She hesitated. "When you said it I thought a lot about what you meant by going first. You told me what you were looking at when you went back in front of me. I thought about what I had been looking at every time I had my penis in a hand, I even fantasized if I had a vagina." I was thinking that I could make a lot of good things out to hear. I wasn't going to lie. I wanted to hear what I thought. "I always wished that I had had sex with my roommate." I finished for her.</p> <p>"Really?" She asked surprised. "Was it alright with you?"</p> <p>"Oh my God. I just remembered that you asked me to go first with you. I remember how I felt when you pulled my hand away. I wanted to do the same thing with yours." I smiled. "I remember that you said you hoped I was going to put my penis in your vagina as well," I said. "You were so excited. I was thinking that there was something very special about it too. I felt a strong strong yearning to have sex with you."</p> <p>Ashley's face flushed and her body quivered from a side effect of my words. "I would like you to do it. That's so special." She was looking directly into my eyes. "I love you."</p> <p>"So do I." I told her. "But first, it is time." I said standing up. "I have to run. I have had a feeling I might be losing you for a while now." I grabbed my bag, put on my jacket and walked out to my car. I looked for Ashley, but I saw her walking back toward the house. I waved and went back to her.</p> <p>"Wow! We were so different," Ashley said when I walked through the door. "And I had no idea where I was going to get lucky."</p> <p>"What? You were never going to let me make you cum in front of a stranger was there?"</p> <p>"No, I wasn't going to let you make me cum. I only want to make you remember what happened.
