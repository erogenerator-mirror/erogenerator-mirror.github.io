He had a look of pleasure on his face.</p> <p>"Mmm, that was tasty" I said to him as I gently squeezed his cock and balls.</p> <p>I moved up to his ear and whispered to him that it was now my turn to be satisfied. He nodded, and I moved back down to his cock, licking the pre-cum off and rubbing it in his pubic hair. I moved my mouth up one side and down and I held his penis in my fingers and licked it as he closed his eyes. He was enjoying it.</p> <p>I moved back up to his chin and gave him a sensual kiss on his lips, and then I turned and moved over to the bath. I slid myself in and let him rub between my legs, until it touched and throbbed around him. I got to the head, and gently pushed it in until he could go no further. He had stopped stroking my cock and was watching me. I looked down and took his hand as he pulled me into him, and we kissed as he got his big, beautiful cock up inside me.</p> <p>It only took him a minute before he had his lips onto me as I was thrusting and pulling him towards me. Then he pulled me as his cock shot it's load inside me, and I was sucking his mouth as he had mine. I got away from him and stood up. He was looking at his beautiful cum-slick cock laying over his other leg. I looked at him as he looked down at me, and I smiled. We didn't say a word for a while; there was a long, sweet kiss, and when he pulled me to him, and we held each other, his hands started to wander, first over my thighs, and then up my body.</p> <p>His hand found my pussy and he started to kiss me. I lifted myself off the bed, and I felt him on his knees between my legs. His tongue began to explore, and soon began to lick up my lips, opening my slit as he put his finger inside. Then he took another finger, and began to move them in and out.</p> <p>"Now please" I whispered as he moved up to my clit, and began to make circles around until my hips jerked upwards.</p> <p>"Yes", he moaned in my ear as he slid his fingers in and out of me, working them in and out and licking me up-and-down. My thighs were trembling as he continued to do that. His cock was very hard in his hands as I turned to face him. We kissed as he continued his teasing of my clit, while his other hand found his cock and stroked himself as he kissed me passionately. Soon, he was moving up to kiss me, and I began to stroke his penis.</p> <p>"Yes", I said as I took his penis in my hand. I wanted to feel his big, hard, beautiful cock inside me.</p> <p>He had moved his cock over my breasts so that it was lying on my stomach, where he could have my nipples at the same time. I rubbed his cock back down my stomach. I continued to stroke it slowly up the side and down the other side, moving it over my breasts. I reached with one hand and felt for his testicles. They always felt very big and the head looked a bright red in the light. Now I slowly and very firmly squeezed his balls.</p> <p>He pulled away, looked me in the eye, and said</p> <p>"I want to suck your beautiful cock now",</p> <p>And with that we began to get up.</p> <p>We quickly got into my bath, got down to our robes and sat down on each side of one other. It was very nice, to be able to lie side by side, with his manhood pressed tightly against my thigh! I didn't want to move, but I couldn't help it.</p> <p>I opened my mouth and he went in, sucking my tongue around it, before he started to move his own. He wanted me to suck him. I closed my eyes and began to suck and lick his tip as his cock moved in between my lips. I knew exactly what he wanted, and I wanted to do it so badly.</p> <p>He let out some kind of groan as his head moved back, then he moved it in me and we began to move. I felt his hot hands come over my face, and rub my cheek. And then his fingers closed over my lips, and he pulled back out a little, before again going back in.</p> <p>I was getting used to his cock, and he was moving it slowly. As I took a breath, I could feel his balls rubbing down my thighs, and on the outside of my calvesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
