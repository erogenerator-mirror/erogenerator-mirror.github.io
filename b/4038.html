The dance continued for another fifteen minutes until the two men got tired and left. They didn't see them for a few minutes when one of them said something to the other. They both got up, and went toward the door. As he stepped past Mike, she was saying something to him.</p> <p>She paused and said to him, "Thank you. Thanks for bringing me to this. I really enjoyed myself. I want to do it again sometime."</p> <p>Mike looked at him and they smiled at each other. He walked out on to the couch and sat down. He was still feeling a bit strange in the middle of the evening.</p> <p>A few minutes later the man he had been dancing with came to the dance floor and gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He said that he hoped that she enjoyed herself. He looked at Mike and they both smiled. He said that the man had introduced himself to him and what an amazing performer he was. He wondered if he could tell what part of that he would like, if it would turn her on, or if it would turn her off. He then said that he had had to make sure that she was really feeling sexy in front of the men so he would leave without having to do anything more. Mike smiled at that and said that she really enjoyed the dance. After the embrace and the kiss the man walked her to the table. His hand lingered a bit too much in the brief moment that Mike held the woman in his arms.</p> <p>He led her back across the parking lot, and then to his car. He opened her door, and helped her into the car. He put his foot down over the footstool then placed her hands on his shoulders and leaned down and leaned down and began to kiss her neck. His hands roamed up the front of her body as he moved his lips over her throat.</p> <p>She leaned back into him as he gently kissed the top of her breast and he felt the nipples beginning to harden again. She pushed back against his chest as his hands moved from her breasts up and down the outside of her legs. She leaned her head back and allowed her hands to come to rest on the front of his head, as she started kissing him all over.</p> <p>She began to kiss her way down his chest; when she got down to his navel, she began to kiss and lick the outline of his cock through the material of his trousers. When she got down to the bottom of the belt of his pants she reached in and removed one of her hands and slipped it up between the front and the front, and pulled it out so she could rub his cock through them. She kept her hand there until it was just below the band of his boxer shorts. She reached in and pulled her hand out slowly, then she gently eased his cock out from his shorts, and as she got into a rhythm of rubbing across the head of his cock with her hand she said, "You've got very impressive cock, honey."</p> <p>Mike just grinned and said, "Yeah, it's just a little small compared to this, but you are very nice and thick."</p> <p>"Can I kiss it?"</p> <p>"Sure sweetie, I want you to do it."</p> <p>She slid forward until his tongue was pushing into her mouth and she sucked on it with her tongue for a second while she began to gently rub his cock up and down slowly but quickly got into a more vigorous pace and she moaned and began to lightly bite down on his tongue.</p> <p>"That's it, I think you are enjoying this now, huh?"</p> <p>"Oh God yes, just keep doing what you are doing, but I don't want to cum yet."</p> <p>Mike took both her hands and put them on his cock. They began to rub up and down the shaft with her fingers, as they did this her lips would not close around him, and she wouldn't allow the head of his penis to touch her mouth. He ran his hands over her shoulders and shoulders and down her arms, and back up again. He did this at the same time she held his cock in a small hand. He felt her take in a deep breath, and then she took his cock deep into her throat. She started moaning now at the pleasure of her fingers being in his cock. Her hands were still holding him with the thumb and index finger holding his shaft, as her tongue and lips were teasing his head. He felt his cock begin to pulse, and in spite of every effort he had put into getting closer to climaxing. He held her head in his hands as the orgasm approached, and she tightened her tongue against the very tip of his cock, as she pushed him toward that sweet spot.</p> <p>"Oh my God, OH MY GOD, you are making me cum! I can't hold onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
