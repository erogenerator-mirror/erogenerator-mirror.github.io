They drank, drank some more -- they’d hardly finished the bottle anyway.</p> <p>Dani sat down on the edge of the couch. She was naked under the skirt, and her breasts were bare and exposed. I wasn’t the least bit embarrassed; they were gorgeous -- pert, large, and very round with large areolae. I couldn’t resist. I leaned over and took her right nipple in my mouth. She gasped with pleasure, and moaned softly. I let her nipple go and moved to the left one, which I took as my tongue darted around it. They were very soft and suckable, just as I imagined them.</p> <p>I kissed my way up the inside thigh of her thigh, then came back to her left thigh and began licking and kissing. I could smell her perfume, and I let my tongue travel up and down her warm flesh. She was very wet, very excited. Her scent was strong with her desire, and I let my tongue slide across her and start probing her anus with the tip. It wasn’t long before she was moaning and sighing and writhing, writhing with pleasure. I stopped licking her, and she was panting hard. I lay beside her and kissed her gently.</p> <p>“It was good,” she admitted. “It worked. I have a wonderful orgasm, I know.” She kissed me passionately. “We might have to stop. I’m afraid of how I would react if you left me.”</p> <p>I knew that she didn’t want to stop, that it was okay for another minute or two, but that she wanted some real loving. I kissed her softly. “I think I’d have done this a long time ago,” I commented. “But if you continue to feel that way, I’ll have too many orgasms. And you'll be ready again in a heartbeat. I’m right here for you.”</p> <p>She pushed me onto the floor and pulled up the skirt. I watched her as she did so, watching her hips move, watching her face, studying her expressions. She was completely naked, and I had a strong urge to taste her. When was it? I wondered. I had only just arrived on campus. I’d forgotten about the rest of the time. I had heard of such places – it was only when the classes ended for the next week. Would I like to know if it went on?</p> <p>Dani slid a finger deep into her own slit. “I feel hot and sexy,” she said, kissing me. “I think you will like it when you feel me, too, don’t you?”</p> <p>We lay together for a minute, the scent and the light and the feel of her body together in my arms. I felt no longer a virgin, not sexually at least. I was no less experienced in finding and giving pleasure. I knew the pleasures of a woman, of course. I had done many things I would probably never do, and that was great. I did it because I felt good, and I felt good knowing that she was feeling good. I was her student in the moment. I felt good knowing what others were feeling, and what you wanted to do. I had had sex with many women, and I had always had the best experiences. I liked that I could make others feel like I had.</p> <p>We kissed, touched, we kissed some more, the smell of her cunt was intoxicating, and I could feel the wetness and the aroma of her, in the midst of me, making sense of the moment. She was moaning, groaning, her body writhing all over. She had opened her legs again. “Just for a minute,” I suggested. “Let us catch my breath, and we can try it again afterwards.” I moved to get up, feeling a little dizzy. I could hear the wetness of her, feel her sex. I was in some sort of dream place. I felt completely safe and warm, and she smelled a little musky and sweet.</p> <p>It was the best sex in my life, and I was enjoying it too. She got up, and we kissed again, letting the smell of her cunt waft up to us. I pulled her to me. We kissed a little harder this time.</p> <p>“Let us do this again,” I said, kissing her again. She smiled and said “I think we better, if we had been here that long.” She laughed, and we kissed some more. I was glad to be rid of my inhibitions. I liked having her naked, though—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
