It's a lot more private than yours, so don't bother."</p> <p>"Yes please," the first person who responded was her. "It is so exciting to write you." She typed back.</p> <p>"You have no idea," came some response.</p> <p>She was starting to like the new site. It was so nice that they hadn't asked. They just knew what she liked and didn't hold anything against it, but it was far more intimate, and much more exciting.</p> <p>"So do you think we should share the next part with you?" She typed back. "Or are you willing to submit?"</p> <p>She got the feeling that the idea of submitting was getting her aroused. I want to suck his cock.</p> <p>"I will do it if you want me to."</p> <p>"Of course," she said again. "I'm ready when you are."</p> <p>Her story was a little different. She did want to suck him and would describe it as if he were her favorite lover. The "girl" was a bit more descriptive.</p> <p>"Are you a virgin?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Tell me your virginity."</p> <p>"A boy?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"A virgin?" she typed. "Well, I guess you know what I mean."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"What do you like about me? Tell me all about yourself."</p> <p>She was starting to get turned on. "I like to be watched. I like to be watched... and I like to be taken. I like it when men do me."</p> <p>"Good girl." She typed back. "But, I don't want you to be my first."</p> <p>"Oh, we will be first," that was more of a message than actual letter she sent.</p> <p>"I'm your first." she replied quickly.</p> <p>I'm so excited.</p> <p>And, there aren't too many things you don't want to do." she said with a smile.</p> <p>"And, you will like it," she responded.</p> <p>I'm so excited about sucking his cock."</p> <p>"I love it."</p> <p>"You will like it," she said. "He likes it that much."</p> <p>"I will try to keep it as much of an open box as possible." she typed back.</p> <p>"Maybe all that makes it that much of a turn on to know your first guy was my first..." she said.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>He was waiting in the bedroom. "Come stand at the edge of the bed." he told her.</p> <p>He got her to stand on the bed and then positioned her so that the edge of her breast were touching the edge and her back was facing him. She could feel his breathing, which seemed to increase the pressure on her nipple under the fabric of her bra. Once he was down on the bed, he took her hands, lifted them, and placed them on her breasts. He kneaded them and she could feel a growing hardness against her hips, and then he pinched both nipples at the same time, and then rubbed his finger along the cleft of her labia. It was obvious that he was touching the very end of her slit.</p> <p>She could feel him breathing heavily and then his mouth was on hers kissing her deeply. He moved his hand from one breast to the other, and then placed it around the back of her neck at the bottom which made her jump and press herself against him. His mouth never left hers and his hands moved down to her hips. His fingers began to slide the sides of her waistline, then up the sides of her skirt. He stopped again, and her fingers moved upward into his hair, guiding him to her breasts.</p> <p>Her nipples were hard and ached to be sucked, and she wondered how he would use them to stimulate them. They were just an inch from his face as he lowered his lips to hers. He sucked it in and pulled the nipple with his lips and then ran his tongue down her stomach, stopping at the panties but no further, leaving her open to his probing fingers. He lifted his head upward and kissed her and touched his tongue to her earlobe and then the soft, warm skin of her cheek.</p> <p>She gasped slightly when his tongue ran down her neck across her soft, soft shoulder, and kissed the collar of her neck, moving from her right side to her breasts. She felt the breath of his lips on her exposed skin and a new pressure inside her body. He pushed her forward again and she felt his fingers touch the sides of her panties and rub her moistness through the cotton. He kissed her breasts from below and slid the panties down her leg and off over her thighs. His breath hit her pussy now, and she almost couldn't breathe with the pleasure and excitement.</p> <p>Without aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
