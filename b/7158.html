I was beginning to like the idea that he would be able to take his time at all, that he would be pleasurably patient as he slowly explored my depths.</p> <p>I moaned and mewed when he slipped his thick finger as he went for my slit, just barely inside. I closed my eyes for a few moments as I began to feel pleasure start to build up deep inside my crotch. Lance began to gently pump the finger inside me, just barely. I raised my hips up to push it farther into me.</p> <p>"Lance." I whispered. "Please."</p> <p>Lance's fingertip left my hole, his thumb slowly entering me, as his middle finger found my spongy ring. He rubbed the pad and ring for a moment then slowly pushed his middle finger against the rough and rubbery soft opening. My body shivered as i felt his finger enter me. He slowly began to open me further, as his thumb opened me. I raised my knees higher on the mattress so that the pressure on Lance's finger increased.</p> <p>"Oh Lance." I sighed softly as Lance's thumb slowly entered me, stretching me wider. He stopped just short of breaking it, then slowly pulled his thumb back as he began to push it up me. Lance slowly slipped his finger out and I held for him. My breath was unsteady and I could feel myself beginning to tighten up and move.</p> <p>"Oh my. Lance." I moaned as I felt myself spread over the fingers of his other hand, as he spread me open again. This time his fingers came in contact with my g-spot, sending shock waves through me. This time Lance's thumb entered me and the palm slid under and began pushing against it, as he began to massage my g-spot back there with his thumb. My breath suddenly knocked out of me. I gasped as Lance continued to apply pressure.</p> <p>I felt Lance's grip on my shoulders tightened. He removed his hand from under me and moved to pull me off the bed. I moaned softly and lay there for a few moments, as Lance once again began to work up my body, again. My body was twitching and convulsing with lust, as he continued to stroke me from the outside.</p> <p>Lance once again bent down and began to kiss me softly, then deeply. I could feel my body quiver as he kissed up my body, along my jaw, to my ear, and then slowly kissed my wet, wet chin. My body started to move again and I could feel myself become more excited as Lance began to kiss up my neck. He sucked my ear-lobe into his mouth and rolled each strand of pearls through his tongue as it passed across it. His tongue continued to caress my ear as he kissed it.</p> <p>Finally, he let the ear-lobe drop from his lips and moved his mouth down over it to lick it gently. My nipples stiffened in response and Lance's mouth began to trail down from my neck to my breasts. His lips kissed one nipple then the other, before kissing, licking and sucking each nipple. My body quivered and pulsed with each touch of his lips and tongue. His hands roamed over my breasts and stomach, which I began to grind into him. My thighs rubbed against the bed as an orgasm started to build deep in my groin. He pushed my legs farther apart and slipped his hands down from my breasts to my thighs. My breathing stopped and I could feel myself begin to cum, though slow, as my pleasure was interrupted by another orgasm, this one more intense and intense than the one before.</p> <p>Lance's hands moved to my pussy and began to work my lips and clit. I raised my hips to meet him and felt his finger penetrate me, as he finger fucked me. Lance took his fingers out and moved himself down next to me. I could see that he was hard beneath his jeans, and was stroking his stiff cock to full arousal. My breath was coming in short, high, gasps as I rolled up and lay beside him, once again, naked except for my stockings and garter belt. I looked into his eyes and held him. He looked down at me then back up at me.</p> <p>He said, "It will be my turn to fuck you soon."</p> <p>My eyes opened wide when I saw his cock. I hadn't even realized it was there. My eyes opened wide in reaction as he moved between my legs. His cock was almost hard, yet the tip of his head barely came inside me, before pushing forward and into me.</p> <p>My legs parted for him as he went up and down in my body. My hips moved up to meet him, as he thrust into me from above.
