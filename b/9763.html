I was just, um, in need of some help. I don't usually let a woman help but there's not much I can do about it."</p> <p>"Well if it's nothing else, help is a very welcome gesture." His eyes were bright and twinkling. Then he said, "I'm sorry. I won't be going in. Please excuse me. I've got to go."</p> <p>"Oh, okay. Uh, I wouldn't mind if you went in. I don't know if I could do anything more." She reached out and grabbed his hand.</p> <p>He looked surprised, but pulled it closer. "I would like nothing better than you stay here with me. Is that okay with you."</p> <p>She felt a little embarrassed, wondering what he was thinking. But she thought the same of this young man. He didn't have to have seen her like this. She pulled him down onto the couch and they immediately fell asleep in each others arms.</p> <p>****</p> <p>He awoke first thing the next morning. They were in each others arms. He looked around for somewhere to sleep and then a few seconds later found an armchair across from a roaring fire. He got into bed and covered him with the blanket. She followed in a few minutes later wearing a tanktop and shorts. He felt like an intruder again. She sat down next to him and started touching his face. He could feel that his prick was hard and straining to escape the confines of his jeans.</p> <p>They spoke softly, "We must do this," and they kissed. Her lips brushed his, and then he kissed her neck, across her chest and then back to her mouth. Their kisses were getting more and more passionate. He slowly pushed her shirt up her body. Her skin was tanned and smooth and warm. Her nipples rose and ached for his touch and mouth. He kissed her chest down to her left nipple and he sucked it gently into his mouth. He then took the tip of it into his mouth and sucked for quite a while. Then he bit down ever so slightly and began to flick his tongue around the areola.</p> <p>She moaned. He moved to the other one a little harder and started to kiss down the middle of her chest and stomach, which was beginning to turn to goose bumps. He reached the bottom of it and began to lick her down the center of it and then back up again. Then he stopped for a second and looked up at her. "Please wake up a little," was all he said. He looked behind her and then back to her. "Do you know why this has to stop?"</p> <p>The young woman looked puzzled. "Please. Please wake up. I want it all," was the only thing she could say.</p> <p>His cock grew rapidly in response to her plea. In answer, he kissed her neck and upper stomach and slowly moved his tongue up past her navel. Just as he was getting to her naval, he stopped. "I need you," and he kissed it as a suggestion. She didn't need him to tell her to beg, so she lay back on this big, black sofa with the fire out. She had a thin strip of her pubic hair just above her sex and the pink lips were swollen and red. The tip of his tongue was still wet from his lips and saliva. As he moved it back, he ran it down her crease, down the other side and again around the entrance to her vagina. Her legs were spread slightly, but he could still see her pussy lips glistening with her juices. He licked a drop of fluid and dipped his tongue into the pouting orifice. Then he slowly moved it in and out. He could hear the slurping of her breath and the sound of it as his tongue slid in and out of her sex. Her hips began to move and he moved his tongue around. Then he added his finger to the task. She was really into it now. He licked her pussy up and down and back up and then used his finger to probe all the way around again. She was moaning now and he could see the muscles in her abdomen undulating as she became aroused. He slipped a finger into her and she went hot and dry. He moved his finger in and out and she gasped and pushed it back.</p> <p>She was breathing rapidly now and felt hot in the room. Her hips were humping up and down and he could hear her moaning and whimpering. "Oh, I'm going to come," he whispered into her ear. She nodded and held his other hand up to her mouth. She looked at him as she took it into her mouth. She was breathing hard. He moved two fingers up to her pussy again and began to finger fuck her again while he moved his finger in and out ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
