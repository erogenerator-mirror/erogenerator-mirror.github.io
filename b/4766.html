I shook my head and smiled. "I'm not going to lie to you. If your mother and father saw me here at the farm, they'd have trouble finding me."</p> <p>"Well, they're not here," he said, and I could tell in his tone that he didn't believe that.</p> <p>"You're an idiot," I said and shook my head. I looked over at my father. He was staring at me and I wasn't sure if it wasn't because of what I was looking at or because of what I was hearing.</p> <p>"Is this okay with you?" he asked. "I don't expect it is I, but just say whatever comes naturally to me. If you get hurt, take me to the hospital right away. If your father tries to run after you, you have to go away as soon as possible and let him do it. I'm not forcing you to marry him."</p> <p>"He wouldn't be trying to run the farm if he wasn't involved with the ranch," I said trying to calm my voice. He hadn't actually said anything though, had he? He just seemed to say 'fuck it.' He nodded and nodded again, and I watched as he made the decision.</p> <p>"I'll be safe with you," he promised, and the look on his face when he reached out to hug me made me smile. I didn't even care what his plans were; they were clear. I smiled back and waved his hand away, but I still wasn't ready to settle down with him. Now that I was sure that our lovemaking was going to be mutual, we were getting a little old.</p> <p>"It doesn't make any difference whether you're married or not," he said and I smiled thinking of how much I loved to keep him around. I closed my eye's. 'I'm still a fool,' I thought and closed my eyes again.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll be married again when you're ready," I told him and he nodded.</p> <p>"We'd better get you another suit, huh?" he asked and I looked at him surprised.</p> <p>"It's not like it means nothing," he told me and I shook my head. "Besides a dress won't really do any good with no underwear."</p> <p>"What are you doing on your own? I don't want you to try and ruin your life. Do you think that's what I need?" I asked and he nodded again, but he didn't tell me how. "Well, there isn't going to be any underwear either, is there?" I asked and he nodded again.</p> <p>"You should try going out and buying a new wardrobe. I think it'll work," he said and I gave him a puzzled look. "How could he? You've been on your own for six months," he said and I nodded.</p> <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," I asked, but he just smiled and nodded his head. "I don't do that," I whispered and he grinned back at me. "If I didn't, I would," I said and gave him a questioning look.</p> <p>"Well," he said, "first, you've got to start going to the local store. They don't have any panty lines but there is some that you might want to look at," he said and I shook my head and said, "No, but I do." I nodded. "It's just a store where we should have more options than lingerie so I can go out and shop for new things." I shook my head again and he held up his hand and told me to stop. "I'm not trying to take advantage of you," he said and I frowned. He reached down and grabbed the belt I had on under my skirt as I said, "I don't need the belt." and he yanked the belt out of the loops of my skirt.</p> <p>"I just didn't know that anyone could," I told him as I rubbed his hands. He shook his head and said, "Maybe it's too late to let you go now." I shook my head, but he didn't seem unhappy at all.</p> <p>"Come on," he said as he led me to the changing room. He helped me get my top back on and went down to help me out of my skirt. He gave me a look of approval and I smiled and shook my head. He nodded his approval to me and helped me out of the clothes I had on and told me they were ready when I came out.</p> <p>"I'm not going to take any chances," he said and I felt like I was in another world, not that I was sure about my feelings for him. He gave me a look like that and I shook my head.</p> <p>"I won't do anythingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
