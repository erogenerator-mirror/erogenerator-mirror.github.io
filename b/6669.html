I'm not done," she called back. "Let's get ready to go."</p> <p>I took a long minute to take her to one of the big hotels where we had booked, and we headed across the street for a coffee shop down the block, where we could get in the coffee for a bit. While Sarah got the coffee and then took a seat across the table from me, I poured out a cup, and started to pour more wine. Sarah was still wearing her pants, but as we were sitting together she had loosened her belt and it dropped open under her skirt. She didn't need an explanation as a flash of her bare pussy came into view. It was obvious she had no panties on.</p> <p>"I'm going upstairs to change. Would you like to join me?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I'd love to. You don't seem to have much work to do," she said with a broad smile, then took a sip of her wine.</p> <p>"You can call me David," I said. "That is if they want to hang with me?"</p> <p>With a smile, Sarah said, "You're all full of beans. Let's go back to my place and have a good time while we can, and I'll tell them all about it tomorrow."</p> <p>With that, Sarah grabbed her tray, and we were out the door before I could even get my keys and I started driving her home. As Sarah stood in front of me, looking absolutely gorgeous, I couldn't help but stare at her body, and as she approached me, I could feel my heart racing. She had on a short pleated skirt that came just below her knees. When she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek, she could feel her own nipples straining against her bra. She ran her hands through my hair as the kiss became more intense, and our hands were busy as well. As we finally parted, I could feel Sarah pulling her skirt up her legs as we hugged each other and kissed deeply, almost passionately. There was passion in her kiss as that same tongue probed its way between my lips, as I could taste the wine in her mouth.</p> <p>Finally we separated and we both stared into each others' eyes, and she smiled at me and said, "That was a wonderful kiss."</p> <p>"Yeah I know. It was the most intense and thrilling kiss I've ever had with someone," I said, not waiting for an answer. I got out the keys, and we drove like that for over an hour, with our arms tightly around each other and our mouths locked in a passionate kiss. Every breath was sent from my lungs into hers, my chest felt like it was under her tongue, making me think that we were both ready to jump the other's bones. Our kisses lasted for several minutes, and I could feel Sarah's hands all over me until we reached a stop at one of the hotels. We both got out, and as we walked into the lobby, Sarah and I looked at each other and said, "I can't tell them that the man I'm with is a married man."</p> <p>As we walked toward the elevator, Sarah started to remove a couple of buttons at her top, and when we arrived in the elevator, she did a really incredible job of undoing it, leaving plenty of flesh showing under the thin blouse material. The elevator stopped, at my floor, then we entered my room and she pulled off a condom from under the bed and began to roll it on me. "We can't do this," I said, looking over at her, knowing that the only way she could get me ready for her was to put this all on me.</p> <p>Instead, Sarah stood straight and turned toward me. She took my hands, and said, "Here, let's see how hard we can make you." With that she lifted up a hand-held mirror, with her other hand still on the top of her skirt. I had a perfect view of her tits, and couldn't resist. She turned sideways, and had her hand in the small of her back again, lifting her skirt up to her waist and letting it fall back down in a sexy way, leaving me to stare intently at her. She started walking toward me, and the back of my neck and her tits were now showing in the mirror. Sarah stopped behind me and ran her hands along my shoulders and arms, as she bent over to look at her breasts in the mirror. She ran her hands down to my waist and slowly lowered my zipper, as the skirt came down to my ankles. She ran her hands down my stomach, then along the tops of my thighs.</p> <p>Her breasts came to the middle of my chest and I could feel her nipples harden under her bra. She turned slightly and kissed my shoulder as she slipped the zipper of my jacket down, freeing my rock-solid member. I reached up and felt for herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
