I quipped with a smile.</p> <p>"I was just wondering, if you would get in trouble that would be a good situation, wouldn't it?"</p> <p>"Of course it's a good situation, but it would be more of a risk than you know, but I'm sure its worth it." I replied smiling at him.</p> <p>"Then we'll leave, but we'll be right back."</p> <p>"Thank you so much." replied Joe.</p> <p>I could hear him laughing at his own joke. I could tell he wasn't joking right off. We went back into the street and I stopped in the local hardware store. There were lots of people around, most of them working, but one of the elderly, and most of them very attractive, woman and kids, were there. I asked where their daughter was that afternoon.</p> <p>"She's at home alone." replied Joe.</p> <p>I looked around, and a few of the kids, and their parents had joined in this time. I couldn't find her anywhere. I took Joe out of the store for the next stop, and then I went home to my own house.</p> <p>Two days later my husband called me to come and pick him up. We did just that, I picked up the kids at home and drove to the motel where he and I would catch up.</p> <p>When we arrived he handed me the phone and began to explain as we sat down.</p> <p>"He's on the phone right now." I said to him "What did he come by?"</p> <p>"Just a friend. A friend I've been having for quite some time now, and he said he had been talking to me."</p> <p>"Did he say anything to you about what time he was home and when he called." I asked?</p> <p>"You asked him that question." he replied, "Of course he did. I didn't notice you guys getting to that point at the moment. When he called again he said that he would be in town and would leave by himself. That I was welcome to join him. I wasn't sure what to do, so I asked my kids to come visit, but instead of trying to run away he went behind me." He smiled at me, "I was in the motel room and I thought I heard him say goodnight to a lady."</p> <p>"Oh my God." I thought, "he just rang me to get started and then he was gone."</p> <p>So I told him where he could get me a cup of coffee and a soft drink, and we went off. We had coffee and a soft drink, and then we stopped for a walk and sat by the lake for a while.</p> <p>We sat there and just enjoyed that moment. Joe had become such a friend since we had met, and I couldn't even recall seeing him looking at me any differently. That was really something, but if he looked at me that was a new one.</p> <p>A couple of weeks went by without Joe returning to town. I knew he was going to be in town, but I was also looking forward to meeting Joe again. I had been in town with my ex-boyfriend who had a couple of drinks, and was just about to leave.</p> <p>He was out of town on business, so I thought he would still be here. So I called Joe and told him I needed to talk to him alone. I was still feeling a bit horny, and the sight of him sitting there in a bathrobe didn't help that either.</p> <p>"Joe will be in town today and he'll be back tomorrow, and I don't want to miss his visit, so if you still want to get together you come over around one o'clock, OK?"</p> <p>"OK, I'll see you tomorrow then." was his answer.</p> <p>That had been a long time coming. I was so happy when he was just going to be gone. I had gone to bed that night thinking about the day ahead. Joe returned from his visit and when he did, he took me to a very comfortable chair and we took off all the clothes that he had worn, with him even taking a quickie. When he came back into the house I had already changed into just a pair of swim trunks, and Joe had changed.</p> <p>I knew that he could stay in the room all day and not be disturbed, so I told him I wouldn't wait and he just went toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
