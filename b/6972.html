The girl, my sister-in-law, was there. It was only when there hadn't been time to talk and then, when the kids were asleep," he said with a shrug. "That's when I would say something really stupid. She was trying to explain all the kids being out of the house. I really needed to look out for the three of them so, after a little time, when I'd been really bad, I'd gone to the liquor store to get a few bottles of wine for myself. The wife and daughter were there too. We got the bottle of wine from the shelf and we had a couple of glasses when the girl got back. She took over while he was away, which left me with a full house of shit to talk about with my stupid wife. It was about two years after that then I was still at the house for a while, with my kid in my bed. I never spoke to her again."</p> <p>Trevor took a deep breath thinking that, in the days that followed he'd known his wife, she'd stopped trying to talk to him. His own actions had been the first thing, and she'd said, "That's okay. Your right," before she'd even started to move to the other side of the table, his face had already changed again. He didn't say anything. Just held the silence until she'd finally reached his side. She spoke again, "I don't know what happened last Christmas and I know now, after we moved in together, that it's not going to happen again. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Of course it's not. I know that and it makes me feel like it did. I'm sorry it's been that hard. When we got the kids away from there in December I was so sorry to see them cry. I wanted to hold them and say how pretty they are and be sure they were okay, all without a single word of apology from me."</p> <p>"I do the same thing. You never know," she said after she'd finished speaking.</p> <p>That was it, the big break, if not the biggest. He felt that was where they'd left off.</p> <p>"So, my trip down memory lane was cancelled. I don't have the heart to tell you my last words," he said as he wiped a tear off of his cheek.</p> <p>"That doesn't surprise me," she started, then stopped herself. "Oh, thank God, that's a relief."</p> <p>"It's nothing, actually it's a bit of a disappointment."</p> <p>"I'm too young to be saying anything like that," she laughed before saying, "So if you don't mind, you could have my cell phone number."</p> <p>"It's okay to call you," he replied. He hadn't even thought about it when he'd left his apartment after their little talk. He'd called back just to be sure that she was okay. He thought once that meant yes or no. He had decided to just wait and see how or if anything new seemed. The real hope he had in that he'd get better before she did.</p> <p>"Yeah, of course I could call," he laughed. "My cell phone is just up there on the table."</p> <p>"I'm serious, I would love to call you," she smiled. "I'll do that, or at least see you," she added.</p> <p>"I'm just glad things had sorted out," he smiled back at her. "Thank you."</p> <p>"I'll call you tonight when you're home," she smiled.</p> <p>He heard the telephone ringing and he felt a little better.</p> <p>"Hey, that might be something to do with it," he whispered. "Why don't you tell me what happened? I mean, you can tell me anything. But, I don't want to be on the first talk show about the big job."</p> <p>"You're right, but that depends upon me being there," she laughed. "After all, it's a big deal so, as far as I know, nothing was said that was made worse than it was. No. It was better than all right."</p> <p>"That's a relief," he said. "It makes for some real comfort for me."</p> <p>Trevor got up and gave her a quick hug.</p> <p>"It's really nice to see you. I've been looking forward to your visit."</p> <p>"How did you know?" she asked.</p> <p>"I couldn't help thinking about that," he said. "I don't mean to be rude, but I think it makes it all that much worse."</p> <p>"I didn't realize how big a deal you think it was. I've never been to see you in a romantic setting before."</p> <p>"Well, I'm sorry. I'm not at another time yet.
