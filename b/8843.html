I pulled out my credit card.</p> <p>I saw her looking up at me and I decided it was time to put that smile back on my face as she ran and grabbed for the door. I made a quick exit and followed her as she headed up the street. She stopped the truck and turned back.</p> <p>"Hey baby, I'm ready to go," she said happily. I saw the tears start to run down her face and she buried her head in my shoulder. She sobbed and held on to me until we arrived at the motel.</p> <p>I got her bags and carried them into the room. She looked up at me and just smiled.</p> <p>She helped me with my jacket as we walked inside.</p> <p>"How was your day honey?" She asked.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her.</p> <p>"It was okay. What's not even there," I replied. "What's with you today?"</p> <p>"Come see the rest of my house, you're home alone." Oh God I thought, what have I gotten myself into.</p> <p>"Come on, let's put the bags down and get you settled and then I can show you the rest of the house." she grinned.</p> <p>"Okay." I said. "Go up and change. I have to call my parents and get them on the way up."</p> <p>In the meantime, I checked in on the kids. The one on the left was asleep and the one on the right was awake when I let them sleep.</p> <p>We grabbed my bag and walked up the hall to her room. I closed the door and she opened the door. I was looking around for the kids, but I saw her walk back to the other door. I grabbed my robe and we walked back into the kitchen.</p> <p>"I have a pitcher for you if you want some beer," she smiled.</p> <p>"Thanks," I grinned.</p> <p>We sat down on the couch and she put her head on my shoulder. She was leaning in against me, her arm around my neck, her head on my shoulder. She looked up at me with a dreamy, loving expression. "You're so thoughtful."</p> <p>I smiled back at her.</p> <p>When I brought the glass of beer to my mouth she reached up and kissed me. Her tongue slid into my mouth, making me gag a little.</p> <p>"Come here," I whispered. She pulled back from me and smiled.</p> <p>I got on my knees next to her, and gently took her face in my hands and pulled her to me before I kissed her. The kissing grew more intense and passionate as we continued our passion and heat.</p> <p>When we finally pulled away we looked each other in the eyes and we both grinned. I leaned down and kissed her again and she returned the kiss. She was wearing the same robe I had on that day and I reached for the tie on the robe.</p> <p>She pulled away from me and slipped the robe open, revealing a lovely set of tits, one with a darker nipple peeking through. I grabbed her tit and she let out a moan against my lips. Her nipple hardened in my hands as I took it between my teeth and tugged on it gently. She gave out a low moan as I released it.</p> <p>I moved over to the other tit and started sucking on it, my mouth moving up and down along the hard peak. She closed her eyes and her nipples got harder and longer as I sucked and nibbled on them. I slid down her body with my head and her body shuddered as I made her thighs part and the robe dropped to the floor.</p> <p>She was naked under her robe, her body beautiful as she moaned into my mouth, her tongue pushing against my lips.</p> <p>I wanted her, too. I leaned in and we began to make love by kissing. She was moaning and purring as I made love to her. The two of us kissing and making love were made for each other. Our need for each other was building. Our desires and desires were mutual.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum, baby," I cried out.</p> <p>"That's nice, do it, cum big," she breathed.</p> <p>I held her in the air as I felt my balls tighten and my cock release a rope of my thick sperm deep inside that sweet body of hers. I kissed her sweet face until I felt completely out of breath and began to relax. I looked into her eyes, she smiled back at me and I kissed her.</p> <p>We lay there for a while, neither of us saying anything. After a while, we stood and began to dress. I pulled the robe down off of her shoulders and she stepped out of it.
