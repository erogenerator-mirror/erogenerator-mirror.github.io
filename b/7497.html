You know my dad too."</p> <p>"I can't help it. I see a lot of guys who are hung."</p> <p>"The guys with him?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said with a laugh. "Well let's just say I knew more about what they were talking about than they were trying to tell me."</p> <p>"You don't have to, sweetie," she said, looking up at me with sad, loving eyes.</p> <p>"What do want to know about?" I said with obvious disappointment. "We're gonna talk about that later."</p> <p>We finished our beers and headed home for that night of fun and drinking we had in mind.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>We got back to our apartment around 4:00 p.m. the next morning early. Our conversation centered on the night before and what was between us that morning. I knew that she didn't want to talk about it right away because she was just not ready. Maybe it was because she wouldn't want to tell me the rest of her life. I don't know so sure as to say I was ready to tell her as much as I wanted to.</p> <p>She had told me about what she and her husband had done. I listened to what she had told me about his affair with another man. I remembered the first time I had been a participant in her sexual affair. I had been in the same place and I had watched her do it, too. My heart sank. What had she told her husband when she had been in the same place? She had told me all about it. I felt awful and it's just that I hadn't been able to let myself be turned down. I guess it also seemed kind of hypocritical to her. I was just glad I had never met his wife. She had married the wrong, but he was always at a party where it was different. I had been so afraid it was going to hurt. I guess I was lucky. I suppose I couldn't let my feelings for her interfere with our relationship. Maybe this would improve it.</p> <p>Now it was my turn to have such an affect on her. I was sitting on the couch and I looked at her face and saw the pain in that. Her sadness had just been replaced with something else. She looked up into my eyes and her tears were falling.</p> <p>"I think there's a better thing than a marriage, Tom." She said. "That's why you're the best man I know. I'm sure when the divorce was final I might need a little more time to make a decision. That was what happened with this girl. It's what keeps me going and I think about her every day." I sat there with her and listened to her. I just sat there, too. "I thought it might help you to be a better man. I think it would help you for you to know how to get back at me if you didn't want to. Please, tell me the truth. I need to hear it out for myself if you really just want me as more of a friend."</p> <p>I stood up and walked over to her. I held her in my arms and said, "We're married and we are both sorry. I'm telling the truth."</p> <p>She had turned and hugged me tightly as I held her. "I love you," she said as I felt her tears falling. "I don't want to hear any more negative feelings, but I know what you're doing and if you go through with it, you'll be able to see them better. Don't worry, I won't talk about it."</p> <p>She kissed me passionately and our tongues intertwined for what seemed to be almost an eternity. Finally we broke the kiss and she said, "I guess that's enough for me. I told you last night I needed time for me to think and digest everything. I'm so relieved that I am not going to lose you. Thank you, sweetie. Are you okay?"</p> <p>"I'm always better than okay. You're a tough cookie when the ball is in your court." I answered.</p> <p>"Really, you can still go to my house," she said looking over at her husband. "And maybe you can fix me up too."</p> <p>"I'll always do it when you want me to," she said. "By the way, you're still with my dad. How's he doing?"</p> <p>"Just fine," she said.</p> <p>I stood up and said, "I think it's time to get a moving on. Let's get back together now."</p> <p>"Yes, dear," she said with a smile and a soft kiss on the lips. "I love you."</p> <p>I gave her a hug and a kiss to her cheek.
