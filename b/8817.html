I was having a pretty good time, and it didn't help my own nervousness.</p> <p>"Do you have a cell phone?"</p> <p>"Yes" I replied.</p> <p>"Good, call this number and give me your cell, and I will get you home. Oh, and don't turn on your computer." Then she laughed, "don't forget I bought you a new car so your new girlfriend might as well be home," and left.</p> <p>As I was getting ready to start our walk, a young lady came up, "I'll be waiting for you" but the man just laughed, "that will be your car! I think I can find all that you need."</p> <p>I went to the cash desk clerk, "No I'm with him" and we waited patiently, he was probably just in his mid twenties, and I would guess he worked out well.</p> <p>After what seemed like an eternity, he spoke again "let's walk for a while, and after that, you know where to find me."</p> <p>We stopped and he led the way to the right hand room. "What are we waiting for? Where do you want me to buy you a new car right now?" he asked me.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know..."</p> <p>"Come on now, I was asking, just sit down, and I won't have to ask again," as he led me to the right hand desk. He didn't have a car in sight, and his name tag read "Kieran".</p> <p>I sat down and waited for him to come back with a big blue Cadillac Eldorado. "I don't know what you want me to do with it, but let me buy you a new car and maybe this will help as well."</p> <p>"Oh, that's fine, but I can get your new car on line. There are places around here that are still open for you to meet. Do you want to try it out and see what feels good?" He looked at me intently and seemed as if he was thinking. I was starting to feel uncomfortable here and he looked very interested. I had to say something, so I spoke, "okay, that would be great, what time"</p> <p>As he handed over the keys, he said "let me give you a call so you'll know you can take it. Now, I'm not much of a car driver; I just want my keys on the little counter." He looked disappointed.</p> <p>I thanked him and walked back to my car. "Well, I can't thank the guys enough, they really worked well"</p> <p>"So what does it go to?"</p> <p>"A friend of mine is going to teach it to me next time I go to Europe for a while, and you can learn what it feels like to do the same, and you can go and meet some people there. You can drive a Mercedes, and you can drive a Buick, and I don't care what happens. And there's a girl who does the same thing, but don't tell her if you don't like the way it feels, or she will tell you to stop."</p> <p>He laughed at that, it really was very funny and kind of a turn on.</p> <p>I told him I'd tell him all about it when I got home.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>That evening in our new Mercedes, we took a look around. It looked like really good parts of the road, with nice, but not huge, tires. It reminded me a lot of my old car and I wondered if he would like to see a nice truck like it. We spent a couple of hours driving down some small streets and parking his Mercedes.</p> <p>"How do you feel about a drive in a car?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Well, I don't know what it's really like. I do like to put things where I feel better, but not drive in them." Then he looked serious. I thought I caught him staring at my crotch. I just looked down at it thinking I should run away and hide in the bushes so I could hide.</p> <p>"Well, can you drive the car that's yours?" he started to ask me.</p> <p>"Sure," I answered.</p> <p>"Can you drive it in the back seat?"</p> <p>"Sure, why?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Well, I just can't drive in it with nothing on, besides your clothes, I don't want you to get into trouble or anything"</p> <p>"No, don't think you can drive in a car just for it, you must know how to drive"</p> <p>"No, just leave it in the car, you don't mind if I watch it, and if I do you will have to get in front of it, there is nothing here that will even look goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
