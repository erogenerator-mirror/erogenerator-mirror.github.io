He told her about the accident at the museum, the work he and his wife had done during the late 1960’s for him. Jenny listened attentively and seemed fascinated by what David was making out of the stories he and his wife wrote down. Jenny smiled at David and nodded at his story.</p> <p>“What about you, David, tell me about your childhood,” said Jenny.</p> <p>“Well,” David started, “ my sister and I were going through it together in our teen years. I had the best of both worlds together. She was the only girl in our class except for me, a fact that I knew, but I had the most trouble with the next girl because I was pretty good in math. That made me lose a scholarship.”</p> <p>“Why didn’t you take up Math on your own, David?”</p> <p>“My parents were busy with the family business and I didn’t want to have to do a lot of the things they did. But I did take the time to help out in the community and it wasn’t a big deal. I wasn’t the brightest kid in school. My father was big on academics and he was an expert at it, so the only thing he did on my transcript was help me with something.”</p> <p>“How do you know that, David?” asked Jenny.</p> <p>“They always sent me to them for help when I went to college to help them find something for me there,” David said.</p> <p>“I get it. It doesn’t bother you that you’re so good?”</p> <p>“No. I guess not.”</p> <p>David continued. “Anyway, I went to law school after college and worked my way up to being a teacher,” David explained.</p> <p>“How did you do that?” asked Jenny.</p> <p>“I teach a lot of other different classes.”</p> <p>“I saw you at school all the time,” said Jenny.</p> <p>They talked for what seemed like ages, but in reality was about five minutes.</p> <p>“If you don’t mind me asking, David,” said Jenny, ” Did you ever work on your music?”</p> <p>“Well, some of my old songs were on the internet; it seemed like the best way to do it. What song?”</p> <p>“The one where you go out with a girl who’s about your own age,” Jenny said.</p> <p>“Oh,” David said, “Sounds like a lot of fun to me. What did you think, Jenny?”</p> <p>“Yes, I liked it.”</p> <p>“Wow. You really got into it there, did you?” asked David, his cheeks starting to redden.</p> <p>“I’ve been feeling really good ever since I met you” said Jenny.</p> <p>David nodded his head in agreement.</p> <p>“Have you told your sister about me too?" asked David.</p> <p>“No, never. That’s the closest thing we can come to discussing anything in this town.”</p> <p>“Really?” said David</p> <p>“Really,” said Jenny.</p> <p>“Then how did you make out with her?”</p> <p>David paused.</p> <p>“Well, she was pretty hot,” said Jenny.</p> <p>“Did you see her when you came over on that night?”</p> <p>“Oh, yes, I went out with her later. It was at work, but she wasn’t all that interested in me. It went on for a few more weeks, but we finally got to talking. She did love you…”</p> <p>David paused again.</p> <p>“How did you manage to make it through college and get into law school?” asked David.</p> <p>“It was pretty hard. I didn’t realize how good I was at anything till after graduation. I didn’t find it that difficult…I just wanted to get out of the life like some others.”</p> <p>“I guess I’m glad that you finally made it out of the system,” said David.</p> <p>“I had to stay at home and I had to stay on the student aid payroll. I figured I’d make myself useful.”</p> <p>“How does it work—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
