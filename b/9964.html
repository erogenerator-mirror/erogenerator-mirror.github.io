"You going to get all dressed and stuff that you need at home now" she said.</p> <p>"Sure, where are your clothes?"</p> <p>"Oh, you're ok by yourself. Wherever I am, I'll be ok" she said with a smile.</p> <p>She didn't mean what she said, but that just came across as a way of making her point. "Well, I suppose we have a long while to get dressed," she remarked, and closed the door behind her.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not surprised, you know, I really don't need to wear my t-shirt."</p> <p>"Well, it might be nice to see your body again a while, you were nice enough," she replied. "I hope I'll see you around."</p> <p>"Of course I'll see you around, I love seeing your body."</p> <p>Lori started to walk away, but stopped. "I want to walk away again, but I want to have some fun," she said with a smile and a wave.</p> <p>Before Lori's eyes could move, Bill walked through the door. He was dressed almost the exact same as before, except this time, it was a light blue pair of Levi's and a white button down, button down in a pocket. He had on a pair of jeans instead of the usual white shirt with the sleeves rolled up on top. They both looked amazing, Bill thought.</p> <p>"So what kind of games do you guys play?" Bill asked.</p> <p>"I've never played anything but poker," Lori replied. "I like to play it all. It gives me a game I know is going to get me nowhere, except I do it."</p> <p>"Sounds like it will be fun."</p> <p>Lori smiled, and took Bill into her arms and they kissed a long time. It wasn't anything they had done before, just the very first kiss either of them had been on a lover's lips, but then one of them had touched each other sexually and now it had been an open-fledged orgy.</p> <p>Bill and Lori broke the kiss to get dressed quickly. Bill sat down on the bed as Lori sat down on the chair, in a t-shirt and short skirt.</p> <p>"I've never done this before either." Lori said. "But I like what you have so I guess I'll try it with you?" she asked.</p> <p>"We might just have the time, " Bill replied, and they both walked to the sliding glass door to walk out into the hall.</p> <p>Bill looked at Lori and smiled to himself. He had to admit she was very attractive. She had an exotic way of walking, and she had the presence. With a little encouragement from him, Bill and Lori walked out of the dining room into the kitchen, through the front door to her bedroom, where they saw Bill sitting on the bed. They couldn't have done it without seeing Bill. Lori and Bill stopped walking toward each other and Bill kissed her gently on the cheek, but then, they walked into the kitchen to find Tammy standing there in a short skirt with a blouse which was rolled up over her nipples and barely covering her breasts. Bill and Lori had seen her nearly naked tits many times, but they had never come across the same as Tammy, and it made Lori a lot more nervous that she had ever been naked in real life.</p> <p>Lori moved to Tammy, and they took turns caressing her and kissing her lips before she put a hand on her breast and took her nipple in her mouth, gently sucking on it, biting it, and making her moan. Bill held her hands in place by saying, "I'm very pleased to see you enjoy what we're doing", and Lori went back and forth on the spot, making Tammy more aggressive. Bill was already getting aroused, by the time Lori reached Tammy, his cock was standing stiffly out and was poking out his zipper as he moved toward her. Lori knelt between Tammy's legs, and slid that hand from Bill's head down to Tammy's inner thigh, causing more moaning from them both. Lori slowly kissed her way up to Tammy's mouth and, to her surprise, her tongue darted out to meet Lori's, and the two lovers began exploring each other's tongues in a long, deep kiss. Tammy's hands were in Lori's hair, she wasn't trying to get her in or anything, just enjoying the kiss.</p> <p>Bill saw they were in the kitchen, he had to get out of there, but he had to find some things to help Tammy and Bill alone, so he was soon standing by the bedroom door. They stopped kissing momentarily and Bill could see Lori had gotten off her knees in the kitchen, she stood up and began to strip. She was really getting into this and was running her fingers through her bush under her skirt. She was very wetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
