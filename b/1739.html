He looked directly at her as he asked.</p> <p>"Yes. I mean it wasn't my choice, but I don't care." Her hand went to the belt buckle, sliding the strap off with her fingers.</p> <p>"I'm afraid it is going to be your choice, but you were going to show me this, so get the camera and stop there before you forget what the outcome might be."</p> <p>"Why are you doing this?" She felt so stupid that she couldn't help but wonder what else, and why he was allowing her to take him away from her.</p> <p>"Hm. You'll see later." The waiter came back with the food and started serving it.</p> <p>"I'm just having chicken salad..." she managed to say before her mouth was filled with it. "What kind of chicken would that be?"</p> <p>The waiter looked at her, and smiled.</p> <p>"Chicken salad, if you would please."</p> <p>She had almost swallowed it when she looked at the waiter again, and he winked.</p> <p>"Would you like the check?" He said sarcastically.</p> <p>"Yeah, sure I do!"</p> <p>"And thank you for the check, I hope you like Chinese food!"</p> <p>"Yes, very much!"</p> <p>The waiter came and opened her laptop. It was a bit awkward for both of them sitting down, but there seemed to be no harm in showing each other what he was showing her. A few seconds later it was in that position. His fingers had been slowly pulling and tugging at her panties; they had managed a way through the fabric into the crotch again. The waiter stood up, taking their orders; he handed her a pen and scrawled his name on the pad. He wrote something on it, and returned with the check.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he pointed at the check.</p> <p>She knew that he had a pretty good idea of what the check was for, but it was something they had discussed years ago, and he wouldn't give her any of the details of the payment.</p> <p>"...and here's my cell phone." he scribbled quickly.</p> <p>The check went straight to his email account. He took it and signed off, leaving the page open. It was a small one, but it was enough for him, so her hand went to her pants and they went up. Her underwear quickly followed. From what he could tell, he thought that she wasn't as short as she had been, but her legs looked longer.</p> <p>"There. I guess you're ready to eat." He said with a smile.</p> <p>They were alone again.</p> <p>-</p> <p>"So," the voice of the waiter continued, "if you'd like I've got Chinese food for tonight too. Would that be okay with you?"</p> <p>She was on her knees, and the waiter was standing there looking at her intently. He was smiling, but there was a look of fear, though he did not seem to be in danger at all. Her hands went to her belt buckle, and her fingers trembled with fear.</p> <p>"I'd prefer your panties." he said.</p> <p>She stopped her fingers in midair and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Well... I guess you really want to get out of here..." He held up the receipt with a half smile as if he could think of a way to use it. "Maybe the price is the point of sale. Would you mind if I just made some calls?"</p> <p>"No, that would be fine."</p> <p>-</p> <p>"There is no hurry, okay?" the waiter said as they stood up. "Do you want to tell me your name?"</p> <p>She didn't even hesitate, and said, "Yes. Just call me Sarah."</p> <p>He smiled at her and said, "Well Sarah, don't be impatient. I think you just want to get out of here. I'm sure you have a big surprise waiting for you."</p> <p>She looked up at him and said. "Yes, let's get out of here. Did you tell this guy I was going to order for dinner?"</p> <p>"No." he assured her. "If you really want to join us I will buy you dinner after we buy you an order of you own, alright?"</p> <p>He took her coat off, and held it for her as she looked around at the room. Some of the people she knew weren't there. Others she didn't and asked her opinion of.</p> <p>"What will it be like?" she asked in the same voice she used back on him.</p> <p>"It depends," he said with a smile. "I think I'd like to go with you, and we can have dinner tonight. After that, that's all. Do you want to go to this fancy restaurantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
