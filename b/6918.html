Emily asked, pulling me into her arms and kissing me.</p> <p>"Yes, it's true...I always wondered why you and that girl had so much trouble. You don't even have to tell me this!" I replied, feeling my eyes begin to grow big.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" Emily's tone had changed a number that neither of us had ever heard before. I was suddenly in the mood to do some light petting with a beautiful and sexy redhead.</p> <p>"Well she never liked me that well," I said, looking back at her. "You're the one who always teased me about my breasts."</p> <p>"I noticed," Emily said softly, her eyes darting to mine. "I always wondered what some girl from school would look like without a bra on, too."</p> <p>"Well, you have a problem, sweet lady," I said, placing both hands on hers and kissing her gently.</p> <p>Our lips came apart, as did every other second, and I smiled when Emily suddenly pulled herself tighter to me.</p> <p>"Is this what you wanted?" she asked, looking at me over her shoulder and giggling.</p> <p>"No, this is nice," I said, taking her hand in mine and leading her into the house, where I quickly shed my clothes, and we made our way downstairs to her bed.</p> <p>We quickly got to her room, and without a word we began to kiss again, our tongues dancing furiously. Her hands roamed all over my body as we continued to make out. She moaned as she rubbed her fingers down the side of my thigh, finally reaching her bare pussy.</p> <p>I was completely lost in pleasure as she rubbed her fingers over my sensitive clit, while I ground myself on her thigh. She gasped when one finger slipped up inside her, making her spread her legs even wider to make room for it.</p> <p>I began to whimper as she kissed her way down my neck, as she unbuttoned my shirt and slipped it off, baring my breasts for her. Her lips followed the trail down my body, taking in every inch of it as she kissed her way down.</p> <p>My fingers tangled into her long dark hair as she slid my shirt off, taking her time kissing down my body. When her tongue grazed my pussy, the shock made my entire body tense, and I moaned. I didn't care what anyone thought -- she was going to make me cum right here, right here.</p> <p>I felt her tongue begin to work its magic on my pussy when she licked her way up to my mouth, our tongues dancing passionately. She sucked on my lip and moaned, grinding her pussy against it as well.</p> <p>"Oh, Emily," I moaned as my hand slipped up her soft body, and found her clit with the tip of my finger, rubbing it back and forth.</p> <p>Her mouth opened as her breathing started to quicken. "Fuck," she murmured when I slid two fingers inside her pussy, working them all the way to her cervix.</p> <p>"I'm cumming," I moaned as I began to rub her g-spot, sending her into orgasmic tremors.</p> <p>Her thighs clamped tight around my head as her body went through convulsions, her pussy clenching, pulsing around my fingers as she cried out in pleasure.</p> <p>After her orgasm had subsided, she pulled her fingers out of my pussy and sat up, kissing me passionately for several moments. She then pushed me down onto my back, and straddled my thighs.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she cried, leaning forward and grabbing my cock in her hand.</p> <p>"Yeah...fuck yourself," I murmured.</p> <p>"I need you inside me."</p> <p>"You're getting me all messy too," Emily winked, looking down at the sight of me lying there, waiting for her to impale herself on me.</p> <p>"Don't worry," I smiled, watching her put her hands down on my belly as she slowly began to slide herself up and down my cock, taking in my entire length up to the tip, before sitting down again.</p> <p>Emily grabbed my waist, leaning forward until my hands were against the wall next to her head, our eyes locking. Her eyes were wide, her breathing heavy, and her face was twisted in pleasure.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she whispered when she was confident I was ready. "I want you inside me."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can hold back," I admitted with a grin as she began sliding up and down my cock.</p> <p>"Me neither," she said, looking me in the eyes.
