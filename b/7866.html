But I'm a little worried... I mean... "</p> <p>Now, he started to unclasp his belt and I asked him, "Why? What's wrong?"</p> <p>"I don't know... It's all my nerves..." he told me, and then he began unbuttoning his shirt; I told him to sit down again, and took off the shirt, leaving me, with my back to Tom.</p> <p>He did that for about a minute or so, and when he seemed to be about to say something, I told him I had better take it. He looked at the table, and then down, to a table near us, a piece of paper in his hand.</p> <p>I got up, and told him, "I got this..." and I took out a large, black velvet box in my hand, which I opened with one hand.</p> <p>It was wrapped in an exact duplicate of the dress... it was black, with a single red bow on the top; I opened the box, and there was a black velvet box with a pair of pearl-studded, black pearl-pendants on it.</p> <p>"Tom, this..." I began to say, but he interrupted me, and said, "No, no, no, no - it's yours! It's perfect."</p> <p>So, I got up, and Tom took the box from me, looking me up and down. I smiled and nodded, so he opened the second, and I saw a set of four-inch, gold-studded, sparkling, silver-lace earrings in a pair of emeralds in an emerald ring.</p> <p>"Wow," Tom said quietly. "That's beautiful."</p> <p>To me, he said, "And she's the most beautiful thing this town has ever seen."</p> <p>Now I knew I had gone overboard, so I couldn't stop smiling, because, Tom knew that I wasn't about to tell him that he knew I wasn't all his. Tom looked from ear to ear, and then said, "Now, do the other one."</p> <p>I took the earrings from him, and then looked down. "Wow..."Tom said. Then, he put his head down, and began touching his fingers to his lips, when I turned up the other earlobe and looked at Tom.</p> <p>"Wow... that does have a certain charm, doesn't it?" I said. Then I got out of the car, and took the other earrings with me by the way, and walked up to where the other two men stood.</p> <p>I put two more earrings on both of them, and said, "Tom, if you don't mind, you can sit and watch."</p> <p>He walked up and sat next to me, with his hands on his lap with a look of shock in his eyes. "What's wrong, honey?"</p> <p>"Nothing," I said. "Do you always turn off the lights on and on?"</p> <p>"No, I don't do that," Tom said. "I usually just go to bed at night, where I can't be bothered at all."</p> <p>"It's just... well, I thought it would be easier," I said. "You got a really nice body for a guy, and a pretty good face for someone like me. Why don't you go to bed with me and see what's going on?"</p> <p>"Sure," he said. "Is there someplace you want to go after you shower? I'll do the rest."</p> <p>By now, I was naked, and Tom's cock was rigid against his thigh as he stood in the doorway, looking just as good as it had done two seconds ago, standing up. His eyes met mine as he walked towards me, the tip of his manhood resting against the top of my butt as he stood there. But to my surprise, he took my hand, and led me to the bedroom.</p> <p>"I'm not going to take off your shoes while you're showering," I said. "So, you go to sleep. I'll get something to eat, and then I'll come back."</p> <p>"Okay," he said, following me. And, on the walk, I could feel his excitement, as he walked. "This is a nice room, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I told him. "The bed is nice, too. There's a shower that's right there."</p> <p>"Yeah, right there... "</p> <p>"Oh, that would feel nice," I said, putting my arms around him, and giving him a long, soft kiss. "It's been a long time since I had a guy in my bed. So, it would feel nice for me."</p> <p>"Me too," Tom said, "but I don't know.
