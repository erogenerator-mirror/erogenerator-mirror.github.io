When we both paused at the same time, she started laughing as we kissed. I was amazed, and I told her it was funny. She looked at her watch and told her husband he had to run to the register. We both got up and kissed. It was our first time at a wedding. I don't think we got too much, other than the normal kissing. I guess we knew each other well enough.</p> <p>At the register with the husband, we sat there with him talking to our friend. For some reason he didn't ask what our marriage was about. It would come up later. The girl's wedding was about a month away. We would leave work the next day to do something. He had a date lined up. I guess it was supposed to be a surprise.</p> <p>The day of the wedding came and the day after the rehearsal dinner was in two days, I was getting ready for a long weekend, and when I ran into the husband to tell him we were going out on the town. We walked out onto the street and he grabbed me and told me to give him a kiss. That made me jump out of my breath. I turned and walked away into the rain, which was getting warmer. I looked back to the husband, and he had gotten up to go to the register. I turned back to face him, and my knees went weak. I had tears in my eyes, my heart almost hurting. I didn't want him to see. But he did. He came back, and the two of us were a couple of minutes later looking sheepish. I felt my legs being spread out in front of me, and my whole body start moving. We got back into the car, and the bride and groom both drove over to meet us.</p> <p>The wedding night came, and we both got very nervous. We weren't ready, but we were sure going to say the right things. It was a big night, and at 5:00 the bride and groom all left, and the bride and groom left. We didn't go to the reception, because we had reservations for next season.</p> <p>We got home at seven and the honeymoon started on the same nights we went to the wedding. I was going to be pregnant. It was at the same time our honeymoon began. I didn't sleep well at all the night I was not sleeping, as my body was too happy. Finally, at dawn I woke up to a wet feeling, and I got up to go pee, but had to go down to the lobby just to pee. It must be a good thing I hadn't been in the restroom. I heard people at a table talking to one another, and I felt a sharp pain on my right leg, and I woke up instantly so I started to look over my shoulder.</p> <p>There was the little girl, staring into the distance. She was smiling a big big smile, and she made no sound. Her eyes were closed, and she was breathing heavily. Her hand was still in the air in front of her. She pulled a strand out of her hair to let it fall down her back. Her hair was wet, and her blue eyes were still closed. She looked gorgeous. The baby was in her arms. The bride was hugging her, looking into her eyes. I think I heard her softly saying her goodbyes.</p> <p>I took her hand in mine, and her arm went behind her back. She said nothing. We walked into the wedding reception and the reception was a good one. There were three bridesmaids. I felt like I was going to cry any second. The bride was still crying into the hands of the bridesmaids. The groom kissed her on the cheek, and said "thank you" with his hands on her hips. I heard a zipper.</p> <p>I went to the table to say good morning, when the bride looked over again. She was lying on the floor on her back, and the groom mounted her missionary style. She smiled, and thanked him. The wedding reception wasn't all that long past now. The bride was getting up to the bridesmaids, who were going down to the reception area in a few hours. The bridesmaids were all on their respective sides of the wedding. They all seemed to have a good time talking to each other. A very long, very sexual conversation. But for the time being no more than whispersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
