Don't forget to vote and comment. It's very important to me and everybody's well. I've heard someone tell my name, I've been told it's been called one, I've been told it's been called two, and I've been told it's not that bad, I've heard people come up and ask me name, I've been called a few times, I've heard it's just that, the fact that it's been done in private, that it's very private is really personal.</p> <p>Your votes and comments are always welcome.</p> <p>***********************</p> <p>This is our first part of this series, so I hope you all have seen enough to read them, enjoy it, and decide to continue if you have.</p> <p>I read a LOT, and it got me very fucking horny with all the people that I've seen, and it's only been a few hours, but I'll be telling you more in the next part if you've got time.</p> <p>This is the first part of a multi-part story that is written by me. I hope you enjoy it, and I look forward to hearing your feedback.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Diane looked down at her phone, and her eyes widened as the screen lit up with a message from her best friends. "We have plans for the party that we are having, and I'm going to be late getting home. Would like to be there?"</p> <p>"Ok," she replied. We're going to be there to celebrate our 21st, and to see a film premiere of ours. You will need to be there the day after. Your friend has offered to drive us, the rest is up to you."</p> <p>"Ok, I'll be there. Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I am."</p> <p>"We should also grab our bags, they're still outside."</p> <p>She picked up her bag, and turned to me. "I'll get the rest," she said, and disappeared from the living room. While we were waiting for our bags we talked and found out our friend was only a few days gone, it was all she could offer. It turned out that she was in the same class, and she had been in a similar class for a while, which was also where they knew my brother. They had known him since high school. She and I had always gotten along, even though she couldn't talk about herself, so they had talked about her a lot over the years.</p> <p>Diane's Dad had told her about our new friends, but she had been in a daze until now. She went on to tell me that her and her friends were going to be there, and how much she would miss me. We had not had a date since the party, but decided that it would be nice to get there together. She told me that she had tried to be as accommodating and as friendly as possible at the party, and that she had finally gotten used to wearing the dress that they had given her, and that she was looking forward to seeing it again. I was looking forward to seeing her wearing the dress, and it was going to be so nice to see her wearing the outfit that my brother had had her wear at the prom, and to have her know what it meant. We left the group that had been there and went to the car, and walked down to where the car was parked, and she got out. I opened the door for her, and took her into my arms again, and kissed her lightly on the lips and whispered, "Where are you going?"</p> <p>I walked up to her and kissed her softly on the lips; she seemed unsure until we finally stopped to get our bags. Her eyes were wide and happy when we hugged, and when we opened the trunk of the car I told her, "Get in and I'll drive you home." She nodded her head and smiled.</p> <p>"I am looking forward to seeing you again!" she told me as we walked inside.</p> <p>"And I am looking forward to seeing you again, too!" I told her, and she smiled and giggled at that. "Besides, I like to have you back in my life," I told her.</p> <p>"That makes two of us. You and me. I wish we could have that freedom, but we're not going there tonight." She answered smiling.</p> <p>"Then I think we are going to have to get you out of your dress," I told her.</p> <p>"We should probably leave this car," she said, "it's kind of hot out here in the back of this car."</p> <p>"We wouldn't want to be caught in a cold car on the way home," I said softly laughing.
