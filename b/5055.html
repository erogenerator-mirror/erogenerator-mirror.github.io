Their eyes locked. He was in his work clothes, his clothes, and his erection was fully erect, throbbing.</p> <p>Sara stood, and motioned for them to follow her. She lead them into her bedroom. She told them to lay on top of the bed, and when they were settled with her, she sat on the side and watched them for a while until she moved to her dresser to get them a couple of glasses and a towel, and then she removed a large, double-headed vibrator from the cupboard, set it on the table before coming back to sit with them.</p> <p>"This, you may use my other hand, just to get yourself started," she whispered to them, with a warm smile. "This is a nice toy, and I can use either to pleasure myself, or just watch how you do it. I will have an additional couple of batteries in the camera, and you can hold it inside you while you finger yourselves as well."</p> <p>They both nodded, and she took a couple more swigs from the glass, setting them down. Then, turning the camera on high for a couple of minutes, she pressed just a button and the vibrator came to life. At first, the feeling of it running between her legs, and around her clit, was very pleasurable, and she knew she was getting wet. Then the combination of her hands and the feeling of the vibrator moving in her pussy was a real bonus to the feelings they were both enjoying.</p> <p>After a couple minutes of this, she went down a few more steps and set two small vibrating eggs in their ass. Then she got them turned on and began working them in their asses, as well as their cocks. The feeling of their asses being vibrated was amazing. Soon, they both got a little wet, and then Sara started to work the vibrators in their asses, pushing both toys in and out. It was fun to both at the same time, to see how close the other person's cocks got to the other's clit.</p> <p>"That's good, my baby!" was all Sara could say. That was another nice thing to hear. A small shudder ran through her body, and she turned to smile at her lover, and told him to turn around. A moment later, he was facing her. The sight of his ass, the sight of his cock, standing erect, and throbbing in the air was just too much for her. She lowered herself down and began to lick his ass as she took his cock in and sucked it.</p> <p>"Oh, my!" moaned Evan as Sara began to move her tongue over his ass.</p> <p>"I like sucking cocks," Sara whispered to Evan. Her tongue darted in and out of his ass, making him moan. She felt his cock getting harder, and she pressed it against the back of her throat. They both knew what was coming, and in no time, their cocks were fully erect for one another's pleasure.</p> <p>"Sara," Evan whispered, "You're one hell of a lover, baby!"</p> <p>Sara moved her tongue into the crack of his ass and began to rim him, and he moaned as she did that. She loved the taste of his ass, how a soft, but warm and salty lube made it so enjoyable. At the same time, she pressed two fingers slightly, and into his virgin ass, finding the combination very pleasurable. Evan moaned as she thrusted in and out of him, his cock pulsing as they both worked on one another.</p> <p>By the time Evan came, Sara had a mouthful of come on her hand. She swallowed it, then got off the bed. It looked like a bowl of ice cream on it. She put her clothes on, went back into Evan's room, and took a quick shower. When she came out, she was carrying Evan's box and a glass, and she threw him over and bent down and kissed him again. He said something to her as he sat on the bed, and when she bent down to him, he had a hard time sitting up.</p> <p>When she turned away, she went to take her shirt off, but when he said something to her, she turned back and they went to get dressed after dinner.</p> <p>Sara had them both wear their outfits for bed, and for the next few days, it would be night, but she'd have to give them their privacy. For the next fifteen days, Evan and Sara would be there doing things together for one another. They would do things together together, but they would never be alone in a hotel room.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Feedback welcomeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
