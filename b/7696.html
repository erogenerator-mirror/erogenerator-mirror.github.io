He let it spring forward, almost painfully so, my body aching with sexual arousal. I took his cock in my soft hand and squeezed gently, stroking him and playing with his foreskin, feeling his penis grow and harden.</p> <p>"My God, it's beautiful..." His voice was dreamy and sexy somehow. I looked to see the first drops of pre-cum forming at the tip, watching this beautiful young man's eyes. How could I be that young and handsome? There are so many words that say "it looks so good" to people, but his penis... well that penis, I saw it so clearly, a clear pink tip, a droplet that I could feel run down my thigh.</p> <p>"It's beautiful." I told him again, his words sounding soft and seductive.</p> <p>I leaned forward, resting my breasts on each side of his stomach and ran my tongue along the tip of his penis, just briefly, lingering on the tip. He shuddered and moaned. My mouth slowly opened, licking the head of his penis, my tongue slowly sliding along the shaft, feeling it throb. He was beautiful. I wanted to kiss and lick him now, and lick and kiss it for hours.</p> <p>The fingers that had been stroking my breast were now moving towards my sex, caressing the lips and my hood and gently moving across and around my clit. I was dripping wet, ready to be fucked. My heart was beating so hard, my stomach was hot, my breathing shallow and uneven. I licked around the head and down the shaft, tasting it. It tasted so fresh. Just the faint smell of my body, his semen mixed with my wetness. It had something that sent shivers out of my body, a mixture of excitement and shame and lust and arousal. I wanted to wrap my mouth around his penis and suck him off. Right from the first moment I saw him, I licked the shaft and ran my lips down the thick, silky head, taking more and more of it inside, feeling him expand in my mouth.</p> <p>"I can't take anymore." I said softly, smiling widely.</p> <p>His face contorted with lust and pain, and the head of his throbbing penis twitched. I gently licked the underside of his dick and felt it twitch, harden and throb. I kept licking it and it throbbed in my mouth hard, thick and throbbing. His hands had joined mine on his stomach, his fingers digging into it. He was shaking violently. He jerked his hips, trying to get in my mouth, but I wouldn't let him. I ran my tongue over his cock, flicking it and tasting the pre-cum on my tongue. My hands went back down and gently pulled my clit hood away with one hand and I spread my thighs slightly. The tips of my fingers moved over my swollen flesh and he moved them up and down, back and forth faster now, faster. His breathing was harsh and ragged. He was trying to thrust his hips as I felt myself building up to climax again.</p> <p>"I want to taste you, please fuck me," I whispered out loud to him. I felt his cock jump and grow harder in my mouth. I took his penis deep inside my mouth, sucking him and moaning, feeling him thicken and swell as his orgasm began. I tasted him cum, his seed filling my mouth, as his hips jerked and his cock swelled and hardened under my hot mouth in my mouth. I felt a hot rush of excitement, an overwhelming pleasure. His softening penis slipped from my mouth, his shaft and balls wet with the saliva of my mouth and his orgasm, my mouth still on him and my hand stroking him lightly.</p> <p>I licked my lips clean as he looked down at me and smiled, his dick slowly beginning to soften. I wiped my mouth in amazement. It had been amazing to see him so turned on to be this sexy and turned on. We lay there catching our breath. "That was really... pretty amazing." He said quietly, looking at me. "This is pretty crazy."</p> <p>"Yeah, you can be crazy." My smile was a sexy one. "And when can we do it again, right here, right now?" I asked, pulling gently on his shoulder.</p> <p>He looked up at me and grinned, "Are you asking?"</p> <p>I was a little disappointed, but pleased with myself. I pulled myself out of his bed and slowly walked over to the sliding glass door, looking back at him. I reached out and took his hand, pulling him out onto my bed, gently sliding him along, lettingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
