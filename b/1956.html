When our eyes met, she looked me in the eye again, and for a while, her hand began to move up and down the length of my rigid shaft. I could hear her breathing quicken and felt her warm breath linger on the head of my cock as she watched what she was doing as it hardened and stiffened with her small movements. She leaned forward and placed the tip of my dick at her pussy lips, and I felt the heat building to a feint climax. She held the cock in place for a moment, and then, without another word, she dropped to her knees in front of me and opened her lips. The feeling of her warm mouth against my rod only made it a whole lot more incredible.</p> <p>When she wrapped her lips around the head of my dick and began to suck, it took her breath away. I don't really remember what her mouth was like, but by the sounds she was making, she must have been enjoying it more than I was, because I'm sure she hadn't forgotten I wasn't wearing my condom. Her lips moved smoothly up and down my shaft as she bobbed her head up and down, and she brought me to the brink before backing off and sucking on me. I started to move my hips as I was ready to cum, but she was moving too quickly, and there was no way I could reach the point of no return. She pulled me out of her mouth with a slurping sound and opened her lips to me. When I began to shoot my juice onto her tongue, she squeezed out every last drop and opened her mouth to show me the contents again.</p> <p>"Oh, my god. You did that! You made me cum! I want more!" She said, sitting back on her heels and raising her feet up to her chest. "You made me cum. You really did it. Let's make it a regular part of our day."</p> <p>We embraced and kissed one another tenderly as my softening dick slid out of her and rested against my thigh. "I'm glad we did it, too. We'll have to see where this goes, won't we," I said.</p> <p>"We'll see, too," she said. "I'm still going to have to do some other shit when I get started."</p> <p>She reached under the pillow and pulled another condom out from under a pillow on the night stand. She rolled it over her body, and lay back down on top of me, her body pressed up against mine. I lifted myself up until I was straddling her stomach as she lifted her hips. She pulled me down with her, and we were both on our backs, with her hips pressed up against my stomach and pelvis against mine. I felt my limp dick sliding up her thigh, between her legs.</p> <p>"How'd you like to fuck me?" she cooed, giving my cock a squeeze with her inner muscles.</p> <p>I could only murmur an affirmative response. I don't think I've ever been that turned on in my life. And then, she pulled me closer to her, wrapping her arms and legs around me as she lay on top of me, and we started to make out again, our tongues exploring each other's mouths. When she sucked on my tongue, I couldn't feel her legs tightening even though they were wrapped around me as I rubbed her clit.</p> <p>"You're so much bigger than the last time I saw you, David," she whispered in my ear. "I love you so much, and I want to make every moment special for you. I'm so excited I can hardly stand it."</p> <p>She let go of me and pulled her lips from mine with a satisfied sigh, then laid her head on my shoulder. It was the most romantic way to begin a day. We didn't just make love. We made love, and when she got up on her knees, I helped her lift her hips up and down, my dick sliding up and down between her legs as it went in and out. In the beginning, it wasn't that much of an effort because I wasn't really deep inside her. She didn't need to guide me in or anything like that, just kept guiding me as I entered her. We made love for a little while, and when she moved a little I was sure I could feel her muscles starting to ripple around my cock. I held her hips up with my hands, holding them firmly against my thighs as my orgasm built. She began to shake, too, and I knew she wouldn't be able to hold it out much longer now.</p> <p>"I'm going to come, David," she gasped. "Just hold me."</p> <p>She began to moan, and soon I was sure she was coming too. I could feel it in every cell in my body, and it didn't feel like mine, but it felt like hers, in thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
