She ran a finger under my chin and gently raised my head as a finger slid into her mouth. "So you were enjoying that?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes!" I breathed hotly, unable to speak. I felt my cheeks flushed with shame. I didn't seem to have said anything, I didn't understand why. She looked directly at me. "Would you like to come inside her, with your big head buried in my pussy, or would you like to have dinner with me tonight?"</p> <p>I didn't look up, I didn't know what to say, it was so unexpected, I didn't mean very much to her. She smiled again then reached her hand down, her fingers slipped easily into my hair and she drew me towards her. I was a little dizzy from the rush of feeling my lips brush her neck, her collarbone, her cheek, my tongue, the tip of my fingertips, her skin. Her skin would have been hot to the touch, and warm to my touch. I was on fire, she smelled of roses, flowers...and her voice had become breathy and sexy. Even in the dark I felt her nipples harden.</p> <p>She lifted her hips and moved her leg up slightly. I held my breath and felt her pull my hand lower, her warm skin was so soft and warm against my hand. She brought herself up, sliding her lips over my knuckles, sucking her lips gently, moving my hand and her finger into her. I felt her arch her back, her body trembled. I felt the heat of her body, the firm, hot skin, all so familiar, familiar to me, my touch, all hers, warm, alive, inviting.</p> <p>She raised to meet me, straddling my thighs as our bodies came together and my mouth fell from hers. I watched as her hips rose slightly to position her sex against my leg. "Now come baby," she whispered in my ear as her hands moved to my cheeks and her fingers found my lips. They slid to the outside of my mouth, she rubbed her cheek against my own, my lips were soft. She moved her hips up against mine and, pressing her lips to mine again we kissed hungrily.</p> <p>She moved to lie down on me, her lips sliding down my chin and down my neck, her fingertips caressed me as she moved lower, to where her soft hair covered my chest. I was afraid of opening my mouth to hers, she felt so soft to me. My hips lifted, moved against her, my body moved her into mine again. Her tongue slid inside my mouth, I felt it touching me, and then she was moving me towards her so quickly I knew what she was doing. She was moving so slowly that my hips were moving to match her movements. Her hands were massaging my skin, moving my nipple, my whole body was responding like I've never felt before. The first touch, the feeling, the touch, it was just like nothing I've ever experienced.</p> <p>I slid my hand down and felt the soft, warm, silky skin of her hip before moving my fingers down her thigh and her pussy. She lifted up to her hand and pushed a button I didn't understand until I felt the vibration as she rubbed against my leg. She pushed the button, and the vibration grew louder until her fingers were moving in to my body, touching me inside. She moved her hips against me harder, her body was tense, her breathing was getting shorter, I don't remember ever feeling so full with anything like this. It was as if I could feel every nerve ending in her body, every bump and vein, every motion of her body, every shudder of her body along with the vibrating feeling I couldn't begin to describe.</p> <p>"Oh God! Oh Jesus! Oh yes, oh god!" I felt her body shuddering and then she leaned forward and sat completely on me, her body still vibrating, her breath quickening, I felt her weight settle along with hers and she moved back down. She moved forward and then lowered herself to my lips and she kissed me again. I felt my body shake with the intensity of our kiss. I couldn't hold back any longer and I felt the heat of my own body, every muscle and every muscle, I felt the pulsating sensation at the entrance of her body, I watched her face. Her dark eyelashes and the bright red thatch around her eyes were all those to me, like the emeralds in the forest surrounding her. I felt her lips on mine again, her body against mine, her breasts pressed into me, I felt the pressure of her legs against mine, she was so gentle and so gentle I could barely feel her heart beat against my lips and then feel her lips against mine.</p> <p>I reached for her and lifted her to me as my orgasmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
