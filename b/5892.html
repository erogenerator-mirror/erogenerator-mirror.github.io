My cock was hard, pushing against my shorts, which I was still buttoning up. I saw Mr. M stand up and move to the chair before me, as he undid the clasp of his pants. He slid the pants down his legs with the aid of a hand - almost like he took them off himself, his cock bulging above some khaki, boxers and his thighs. It was like a giant python, thick and meaty, with a huge knot in front against his thigh. Mr. M sat down and I took the tip of him in my mouth, sucking it, licking it, nibbling on it - taking it out every so often, sucking on the crown with my tongue, tasting him, enjoying the feeling of his manhood, pulsating with tension in my mouth. Mr. M took his cock out of my mouth, took me by my chin, turned me to my feet and put me in Mr. M's lap, on my knees, his cock pressing against the outside of my briefs as he lifted my legs and rubbed the wet material of my panties between his thumbs as he spread my legs a little wider.</p> <p>I could feel his cock pressing against the opening of the boxer briefs, and then he was inside me, taking me in every inch, and I was going crazy, moaning, humping myself, as Mr. M moved his hips in an almost serpentine fashion, fucking me, holding me there with his hands, the friction bringing me to new heights in my own little world. Mr. M pulled me all the way up and off his cock to stand up, pulling me towards the bedroom. I felt like I was out of my skin. I was naked in Mr. M's bedroom, lying on his bed, my knees almost touching my ears, as he walked towards me, his muscular body and cock, and then his. I could feel him putting his shirt off, leaving me naked beneath it while he looked down at me. His jeans came off next - leaving his body clad only in a pair of boxer shorts. I was staring at his muscular hairy thighs, legs and calves as he knelt and pulled his boxers down, my eyes following the line of his thighs down to his feet, to his feet, to the dark hair - which I couldn't get enough of with my eyes still closed and my cock hard. He stepped out of first his boxers, the bulge pointing at the side of my face. Then he was naked and I was staring at his cock, which was longer than most I'd seen a man - probably 7" or so - but was a lot thicker. He took his time, standing over me, looking at me. Slowly I sat up as he moved down, laying my head back on the pillow-top bed and opening my eyes. I looked at his cock - a monster. Like a black snake, at the base, with fat balls and bulbous head. My eyes went back to the thick long flesh. Mr. M didn't need words, as he moved his cock down to my chest. Licking his glans in the soft light of the bedroom, his cock-head, then lower. I moaned at the sensation. "Oh, Mr. M..."</p> <p>He grabbed the hair on my head, rubbing himself against my lips, my lips. "Mmm, my baby... you're doing so damn good... so good." He pulled his cock from my mouth, but did not hold back, thrusting into me, sliding hard and deep, in and out. "Oh fuck." I was panting, moaning, and I could feel that my heart was beating and my hands were starting to move uncontrollably, my skin feeling hot and dry.</p> <p>I took hold of a pillow at the end of the bed and pulled it away from my chest as Mr. M moved up in between my legs, and kissed me. His mouth moved down my body and my chest and belly, and all the while, I could not help but moan, humping myself up and down on my lover's cock, while he licked and sucked me there. My chest was burning, my nipples felt like diamonds, with little pink aureolas that were getting harder and harder with each little lick. Mr. M took his time, moving down my body, until his mouth found my crotch, and his tongue slid over my balls and shaft, moving his way to the tip of my cock, which was hard and hot, and he did it again, before sucking me deep. I gasped at the moment, lost in the pleasure. It was an endless experience, and I knew I just had to end it, before I went completely over the edge into bliss.</p> <p>Mr. M didn't wait for me to reach orgasm, instead he just put a finger in my ass, as if he was lubing my passage. He made a circle in my ass with his fingertipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
