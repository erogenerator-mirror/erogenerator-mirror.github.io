My knees started to buckle as I grabbed hold of his head harder than ever.</p> <p>"Oh my god! Fuck me Eric!"</p> <p>He slowed down and leaned back into his chair, his big dick now pushing out of him. He then grabbed a condom from his pocket and started to put it on me. I was scared and excited at the same time. I wasn't sure that was true either as he pushed me to the edge of the bed slowly, making sure that I was on all fours and ready for him. He got on his knees and placed his big dick into my tight hole with ease.</p> <p>He made his way forward then, pushing himself deeper and deeper. The condom was still rolling down as he pushed me back onto his monster and made his way back until my ass rested against his thighs. Eric then started to move forward on his shaft, pushing harder on purpose now as he started to slam my cunt.</p> <p>He was so big and hard! The pain only helped to intensify my pleasure, I was loving every second of it as he used me like my own personal cock whore. I closed my eyes with a moan as our bodies slammed together together. I wanted him to stay as deep inside me as he could get. It only took about five seconds before I was starting to buck and grind on to him as I had been grinding with him.</p> <p>My orgasm came in a rush and hit so hard that Eric didn't stop until his own came also. I wrapped my arms tightly around his body as I continued to ride him as my muscles contracted around him. I finally stopped cumming and let go, my body starting to stop shaking all over.</p> <p>We lay there both panting heavily, trying to catch our breaths. It didn't take us long to realize that we were both covered in sweat and panting. We just laid there for a minute before Eric got up and dressed and checked the phone.</p> <p>"Are you still mad at me?" I asked him, not in the least concerned as I knew he loved me to death.</p> <p>"Sorry honey, I just couldn't resist this," He said to me as he grabbed me into a tight hug.</p> <p>"Yeah, it kinda was a turn on," I said back with a bit of sarcasm.</p> <p>He laughed and said, "I'll never forgive you for showing up on my doorstep earlier than you already did, I didn't realize you didn't need me!" he said with a smile.</p> <p>I smiled back and kissed him and said, "I'm just glad you understand, I can't say anything if you don't want, but now that I've been with you for two days, I'd like to make love againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
