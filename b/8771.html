She replied, and she kissed his lips as she began to rock back and forth on his shaft.</p> <p>"You'll love all the things I like to do to you!" Jason said. "This week is going to be amazing..." They both smiled at this, then they looked up and saw a car ahead of them. "Holy shit!" They thought at the same time.</p> <p>"It's the police!" the man said, as they sped off. "But, they'll need to get us away from this place, before we get far enough to get to this location!"</p> <p>"We're on our way." they said and sped off down the road.</p> <p>* *</p> <p>"I'd be right here if I could!" Alex smiled when she felt his hands on her hips, as she lay on the couch in the living room, with her legs bent, and his head buried in her crotch.</p> <p>"It's just us, right?" she said as his tongue found her button.</p> <p>"That's exactly the way to be when you're here, right?" he said, with a smile, as he began to lick her clit.</p> <p>"You've got me so fucking turned on!"she said, as his tongue slid inside of her and then danced over her clit, making her cum all over again.</p> <p>"I have!" she smiled. "I can't think of anything better!" She added with a grin.</p> <p>She felt like she was going to cum all over again.</p> <p>Jason moved up a little off of her, and pulled his hard cock from her, which caused her to let her legs fall open. He looked at her before pulling out her throbbing clit and sliding into her.</p> <p>He looked at her for a moment. "I want to see if it's even true!" he said, and she smiled.</p> <p>"I'm not done here." she said, with a big grin. "This is going to be amazing."</p> <p>"Don't ever get to be near Alex, again!" he said.</p> <p>"I won't!" she said, before he could reply.</p> <p>"I'm not getting to touch that clit all the time!" he said as he began slowly sliding in and out of her.</p> <p>"I won't touch that clit all the time!" Alex said as she wrapped her legs around his waist.</p> <p>"I guess we better stop doing this!" he said as he pulled out of her, and turned around to face her. He was sitting between her legs, and she reached down and ran her fingers through his hair as he began sucking on her lips.</p> <p>He could taste the mix of his pre-cum and the musky scent of her arousal, and he couldn't get enough of it.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm right close!" she said, and she leaned back, wrapping her legs around his middle, and her hands caressed his face. "That's it Jason!" she moaned, as her hips lifted off the couch and started to grind.</p> <p>She closed her eyes, and she put her arms around Jason's neck, pulling him firmly into her as she felt his cock begin to slide in and out of her.</p> <p>"God, it feels so good!" she cried, as he bit her inner lip.</p> <p>"I'm not getting to touch you any more!" he said.</p> <p>"I don't care!" she cried. "Just make me cum!"</p> <p>"I'm about to!" he said as she pushed him back a few inches. "Just make me cum!" he said, as she pulled back, a little before she could push him inside again.</p> <p>"I'm still a little slow about this!" Alex said, as her movements began to quicken, and her moans get louder.</p> <p>"It's too much!" she said, and she felt her climax begin welling up.</p> <p>Jason continued pushing into her, feeling herself build to another climax.</p> <p>"That's it baby!" she said, as the pleasure began to overwhelm her. It was the most beautiful thing orthing she had ever felt, since before she had been with a man.</p> <p>"That's the way!" Jason said, as he pushed into her again and again, driving her body into her release.</p> <p>"Please...fuck me!" she said as she pulled Jason back to her, and began feeling him thrusting into her. "Please....oh! oh! I can't stand it! I don't want you to know! Ooooooooooh" she cried, as he kept fucking her, thrusting her hips into him. "Oh yessssssâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
