You must have been so worried that you were late."</p> <p>Her hand reached over my shoulder, and took my face in her hands, and drew me to her and kissed me. It was a soft, gentle kiss, that we both knew would be a memory for years to come. Her hand moved slowly, and found mine, and pulled me to her. We lay there for a little while, kissing and touching, and gently rubbing.</p> <p>When her hand slipped down to squeeze my dick, she whispered, "I'm ready." And, she pulled me down over her, straddled my hips with hers, and slid down on my swollen cock, her wet and dripping pussy engulfing my shaft. We kissed, and I sucked on her tongue. Her hips began to rock, and I heard her breath in sharply, through our kisses.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said, "it's been too long." She kissed my lips and ran her tongue in and out, as she humped my cock and I ran my tongue around her mouth. Her nipples were swollen, and her breathing ragged. I cupped her ass as I slipped her nipples between my fingers. It didn't take much of this, and we rolled as we had in the morning when we had come back to bed, and fucked till we came.</p> <p>"Ah," she said. "That was nice." Her hips rose as she slipped my cock from between her lips, and she lay on her side, her hands on my body as she stroked me from top to bottom. "This," she said, "has been a while, huh? You're ready." She kissed me again, and rose, and took my hard cock again, and laid down on her back to finish me again. We stroked and stroked, and we both came, and we came together. It was a little less than we had last night, but much better. It was the beginning of a beautiful new beginningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
