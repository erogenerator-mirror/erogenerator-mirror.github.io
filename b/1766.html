She stopped at the deep cleft of his abdomen. Her gaze traveled down his stomach, pausing at his groin again, and down his muscular thighs. From behind, he felt the slight movement of her eyes. When her eyes were over his groin, she moved lower. She stood and leaned forward. "And...you...look...really nice...and...exciting...at....any..." her voice trailed off as she reached up to cup his testicles and rub them, squeezing them slowly. Again, she hesitated as she felt their weight. She slowly reached both hands around his waist. She leaned her head forward as she stroked his cock once, then slid her face slowly down to the base of his cock. She let go of his testicle with her hand and licked slowly, teasingly. "Mmmmmm...very...good," she murmured. Then she took his cock back into her mouth as she stood. "This is wonderful," her lips glistened in the light of the moon. She dropped to her knees as she went back to stroke his cock. She looked up at his eyes as she worked her mouth up and down to its full length and girth. "Mmmmm, that feels so...good," she murmured. She opened her mouth widely, and slid him in. Her lips squeezed him as she moved his cock in and out of her mouth. She was careful to avoid the head, but she pushed his head against her teeth.</p> <p>His breathing became ragged. "Ahhhhhhhh...." he groaned as her lips moved up the underside of his cock, then down again. He moaned louder as her lips tightened around him. He felt the head slip past her lips several times, then she tightened her cheeks, pulling her head back. She stopped a second time as his cock swelled and her mouth squeezed him. "Oh, no! Stop for a moment, please," he cried.</p> <p>When she had returned her attention to his cock, she pulled back slightly, a string of his spunk stretching between her lips as she moved back up his shaft. She sucked the head as her hand stroked his cock again. A little more spunk trickled from the corners of her mouth. Again, she sucked him as his cock swelled. "Oh, yeah....that's nice!"</p> <p>A tiny drop of spunk dripped from the corner of her mouth and she raised it to her lips to clean her mouth. "Didn't this...happen a lot?" she asked as she slowly moved her hand up to stroke him. She stopped. "Let me keep this for just a moment, please." He nodded. "I want...." she looked up at him. "I can't."</p> <p>"Shall I keep sucking you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well....I have to be clean, I think." She lifted up a little, then slid back down his shaft. Again, the spunk that had dripped from his cock trickled down her hand and over his balls. She squeezed his balls as she sucked him, her hand working up and down the thick shaft. One hand moved against his balls, squeezing and kneading them.</p> <p>"That feels, um...good," he offered. "Just keep doing it."</p> <p>"OK," she agreed. She stopped. "And...maybe another time when you can..."</p> <p>"I'd like that," he offered.</p> <p>She smiled. She sat back onto her feet. "I want to suck it again," she said.
