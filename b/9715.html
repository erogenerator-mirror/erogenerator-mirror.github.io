God, I'd love to be licking up those smooth pussy cream, but I'll just have to wait.</p> <p>I took my penis and began slapping the palm of my hand against her outer labia, causing her to take a deep breath, and she reached down between her legs to massage my prick, then she reached up and took as much of the shaft as she could into her mouth, and sucked it like it was a miniature dick, while rolling her tongue around the tip and over its entire length.</p> <p>I kept up this slow pace, watching her. Finally, I felt my own penis begin to swell, and it pointed toward the ceiling. She gave my penis a few strokes with a wet tongue, and then she moved onto the next penis, and did everything, from my balls, up to my tumescent tool.</p> <p>After a little while of her tongue, licking a tongue around my glans, rubbing the top of the shaft with her fingertips, and rubbing my glans with her lips and tongue, it just boiled over and hit like a tidal wave. The shockwave was as strong as the first shot of semen; the force of each blast was much greater. The force of the explosion was as strong as the first two, and the force of each explosion was more and more intense, more and more, and each explosion was as intense as the one before.</p> <p>I thought, 'That's it, cum for me, cum all over my hand, do it,' but the effect was, of course, very much less than it was like before. The effect of the second one was not as intense - at least by the third blast! - as the first blast was. It seemed to go on and on, all at the same time.</p> <p>All of a sudden, as though being pulled in the right direction by some unseen force, an image of my face in the mirror flashed in front of me and I felt very, very much like I was in the same position. There was something erotic about that!</p> <p>I could do no more than take the picture in my mind and look at the face of that woman who just had the most amazing, fantastic orgasms of her life, and it made me feel like such a lucky young man, for the rest of my life, I will remember it.</p> <p>The following morning, I came home from work and took a shower, then I started writing. As usual, I was writing about things that happened, like the events of last night in the living room the night before and the events in her bedroom. I was still very curious about how it felt to have a man's penis inside her pussy. So far, I hadn't really thought much about it, but I was getting quite excited every time I wrote about it.</p> <p>I decided to write about her getting to know my penis better - in order to know how it felt, to hear what it felt like - and I was pretty much right about that. So I started with a bit of history, as if we were getting ready to be married. We were about to consummate our relationshipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
