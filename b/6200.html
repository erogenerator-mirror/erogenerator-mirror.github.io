I looked down at her legs which were spread open. Her pussy lips were parted and they glistened with her fluids. Her tiny pearl had slipped out of its hiding place. I bent over and sucked it into my mouth enjoying the flavor of her sweet nectar. She was so gorgeous!</p> <p>Suddenly she grabbed my hair and pulled my mouth up to hers. "You better give me more of you. You promised me more in the tub."</p> <p>I grinned - it was just a question. After a couple of seconds she moved back around and took me into her wet mouth again, her tongue going wild over my throbbing erection. The intensity of her ministration caused me to moan. We must have been doing it for over five minutes because her mouth, neck and throat got more and more relaxed and her hands started to massage my testicles.</p> <p>"Oh god ... ahhhh, I'm cumming!"</p> <p>Her body convulsed, jerked and shook. Her mouth was on my whole cock, no more, no less.</p> <p>I was on my knees, hands on her waist, trying to suck every drop of her warm nectar. She was breathing hard as I licked her pussy. I looked up at her; her eyes were closed and her tongue was lapping at the wetness in my mouth. I didn't know if she liked it or didn't - but I think both turned her on. I wanted to show her how much I loved her.</p> <p>When she came down she smiled, knowing that it was all good for her.</p> <p>'She's right, my darling. She loved it ... I love it!' I thought.</p> <p>After the hot bath I dressed and started walking - my erection was back.</p> <p>"Don't go far," she called after me as it seemed a strange time for me - but I didn't care.</p> <p>She seemed to enjoy it too so I left. She made sure that I was in the right lane before leaving. I had a feeling that this would be a new experience for both of us - the best experience we'd ever hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
