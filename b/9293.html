"We need you to work with her to try and figure out who your lover is."</p> <p>I smile. "Yeah, I guess I can do that," I say.</p> <p>"Good," she says. "I know she will help you, but you need to work on being more honest with yourself and what you feel about your relationship with her."</p> <p>"I feel really awkward about this whole thing, so I'm just going to lie here for a while to get my head out of my ass," I say.</p> <p>"Don't," she says. "I'm not going to lie to you. I don't think you're really capable of being honest with yourself, and I'm not going to lie to you either when I tell you about how we've been playing this game."</p> <p>"Do you really mean that?" I ask.</p> <p>She nods. "You're a good guy. Don't screw anything up. You deserve happiness," she says.</p> <p>I agree.</p> <p>She waits until I'm standing in front of her. "Now I'm ready," she says. "Let's change the subject."</p> <p>"Sure," I answer.</p> <p>The two of us switch things with me saying something like – oh, wow! There, I know; it sounded like I had a shit-eating grin on my face – 'What does she want to know about my sex life with Mom?'</p> <p>Mom looks at me. "I do remember when you were doing that," she says.</p> <p>I look at her. "Mom, there is an important rule," I say. "In fact, we need you to listen up when you're in a conversation with someone else. Is that a yes or no?"</p> <p>She smiles. "I'm not sure," she says. "Can't you tell the difference from what I've known since we met?"</p> <p>"How about now?" I say. "That gives me time to tell you why you might be interested in me being with someone else."</p> <p>She shakes her head. "Okay, okay, I admit that you're a nice guy. I'm a selfish bitch who likes to make things happen so sometimes I like to act like a bitch when other people have me under their control."</p> <p>I think about that a minute. "It's complicated," I say. "I really don't want to explain too much. It's not really a topic that is important. What's important is what you think about her, and what you think about her. It's just a conversation of sorts. You might just be able to tell her everything. You might not be able to tell her about me from where I sit."</p> <p>"I think I can take care of that," mom says. She pauses for a second. "I understand you," she adds. "I'd like to know you better on a more personal level than on the personal. Maybe this is too personal – maybe I'm wasting time talking about stuff like this. Let's just keep doing this."</p> <p>"There are other things she has in common with you," I add. "She's a good teacher who knows how to do the teaching."</p> <p>"You don't know how to please her," she says.</p> <p>"Of course I know," I answer. "Do you want me to do that?" After a pause, "Sure, but if that will make you uncomfortable."</p> <p>"Nah," I finish. "I'll be fine." I go to the door and shut it. "Listen, I don't want you to feel obligated on having to talk about stuff you don't want to. I understand your hesitation, but I have to be honest. I'm not saying that I might be able to answer that. I'm just saying it is more than an act. Maybe there is a different quality of you in her than I think there is."</p> <p>Mom looks at me a second or so. "If she was interested in you – which you can see she certainly is – what's the difference to you?"</p> <p>"Well, let's say that she isn't interested in me as much as she might be interested in someone else," I say. "I wasn't paying attention to all that other stuff anyway. The first question is, are you interested in someone else."</p> <p>She looks at me closely, as if she wants to ask me the same thing. "I guess there is a difference, but I'm not interested in someone else."</p> <p>"Okay—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
