So, I just wore this bikini," she added while rubbing the material around her bottom, letting her hand work its way under the hem. "He also asked me to try something on as well."</p> <p>"Something on?"</p> <p>"He asked if he could wear my red bikini on the beach tomorrow."</p> <p>"Do that. And maybe we'll see how well you look in there next time," I said. Even though I was in my best suit by my estimation.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked, looking nervous and nervous.</p> <p>"Positive," I replied.</p> <p>"Ok," she replied, but she was still not happy about letting me see her in her bikini. She wanted to wear a yellow one in front of the men at my favorite restaurant so I could see how hot her body looked in the bikini. We were on the third of the day.</p> <p>"Are we leaving?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied. It was time to get up and go.</p> <p>"You're not letting me stay the night in your room," she said, as I watched from the couch.</p> <p>"Nonsense, I'm sure," I said. "But why wouldn't I let you go in your bikini tomorrow?"</p> <p>"Because I don't feel good about it tonight. Besides, you want to take a little longer than usual," she replied.</p> <p>"I just wanted to try something out on the beach tonight," I said. It was nice that we were able to have another glass of wine by the time we got up to leave.</p> <p>"I'm not having sex in front of people," she said. "I'm just going to change right here."</p> <p>"So, what do you think about coming back in my room?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't think I want to go on the nude beach right now," she stated.</p> <p>I looked at her quizzically. I knew her problem but she had her reasons. She was still nervous about exposing herself.</p> <p>"I'm having sex in front of you while you change," she said.</p> <p>"Good thing I did," I said. "Because I'd like to watch that."</p> <p>With that, I walked her over to her dresser and pulled a small blanket out from the closet. I lay the blanket on the bed and had both of us spread up against the far headboard. She was looking out of the window at the darkness while I reached for my bottle of wine and another glass.</p> <p>"So tell me about yourself," I asked her.</p> <p>"I like to dress in my bedroom rather than a bathroom."</p> <p>"Do you like to be in the buff?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sometimes. I just enjoy being alone," she replied.</p> <p>"Where you from?"</p> <p>"Uwe," she replied.</p> <p>"So how long have you been married?" I asked.</p> <p>"A little," she answered, as if the answer might even be the simplest.</p> <p>I didn't think it was. "So do you like to stay in bed with me?"</p> <p>"I liked staying in bed."</p> <p>"Really?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she said again. "The more I have to do on this island that you like to spend time with me on, the more I liked it. And it's better here too."</p> <p>I was amazed she kept up with me like that. I'm not sure if it was her habit or my own. Either way I was glad to have let her leave her inhibitions and be able to be nude in front of me.</p> <p>"Let's sit down on the bed then. I am not quite ready for that yet."</p> <p>"Are you ok?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course. Why wouldn't I be?"</p> <p>She smiled at me as she sat and pulled her skirt off. She was not wearing underwear. I could smell her musky scent as she slid the skirt off. I had a look at her pussy as well. She really seemed to like the way it looked. Just the way it looked to me.</p> <p>"I'm not ready for any more sexual activity right now. Or for you," she said.</p> <p>"That's ok," I replied.</p> <p>"No. I want to see your cock," she added.</p> <p>"What makes you want to see my cock?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's what you do to me."</p> <p>"But you have to do something for me," I added.</p> <p>"Like what," she asked as she lifted the bottom of her skirt and pulled it up to completely expose her pussy for me.</p> <p>And I did something for her.
