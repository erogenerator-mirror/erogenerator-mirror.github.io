The way you're looking at me... I'm really glad you came."</p> <p>"Can I ask you something?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'd love to give you a handjob."</p> <p>"You better," he said, and then with a look of amusement in his eyes, he reached over and took my hardening cock in his hand. He looked over my shoulder as he rubbed my cock back and forth. I was afraid it would get bigger than it already was, but he was making it harder by rubbing my dick with one hand and stroking my ass with the other. He pulled hard on my dick, and then I felt his lips wrap around the head and pull. He put more pressure on it, and I knew I wasn't going to last much longer. He slid it down my shaft, all the way in in one long stroke. I'm not a huge guy, but he was in heaven. He wrapped his lips around it and went to town, sucking and stroking like no one could. I was starting to cum, but he didn't want to. I was afraid to touch myself, so I wrapped my hand in his hair and held him there while I came in a massive orgasm.</p> <p>He slowly brought his mouth up the length of my shaft and moved to the other side. We were both breathless, and I reached over and pulled the vibrator out of me for him. He looked at it, then reached into his pocket again, pulled out a condom, put the end of it on my cock then kissed me. "I can't," I mumbled. "You're too big for me. I'm married, I'm getting caught up in the sex and you're married. I don't want him finding out." He put the condom on, turned his back to me and pulled up his shorts. He sat down again, turned to me.</p> <p>"You're a good cock sucker... I have to see how good you can suck me..."</p> <p>He reached over and pulled me to my feet. As my cock was hard and standing up, standing straight up in the air while trying to wiggle my way out of his pants, his pants dropped in front of me and I looked in awe at his large erect dick. He was uncircumcised, but I could see the head of it all over the thick flesh. I pulled him toward me and we moved into each others embrace. He kissed me and then sucked on my tongue. He was a sweet lover, and while my cock was throbbing hard between my legs, I didn't think it could get any harder. We were both kissing passionately, feeling each other's cocks rubbing over each other. I broke the kiss and looked in his eyes and saw him holding my hard dick, slowly stroking me.</p> <p>"I've been so turned on," he said. He lifted himself up and pushed his cock into me. He moaned at the tight feeling of my cock filling him up. He leaned into me and began to move his hips back and forth, as his own hard cock moved back and forth between us. "Oh, yes!" he cried out. "Fuck me! Fuck me harder!"</p> <p>I started fucking him harder too, taking him by the hand and leading him to the bed. We fell onto my bed, the sheets of the bed squeaking underneath us, all three of us moaning and screaming in lust. I loved how turned on I was, and when he began to get close to cumming, he pulled out his cock and held it up while I took it in my mouth and continued to suck him until he began to breathe hard. That was all it took for my orgasm to take over me and I moaned out loud as the first shots hit the back of my throat. He moaned with me the second time as my cum dripped from his chin onto my stomach, which was soaking the bed under his body. He moved back up next to me and I held him close to me. We both drifted away when I let my tongue flicker across his nipple as we both drifted off, completely spent and happy.</p> <p>We laid together for awhile, letting each other rest, then we kissed each other softly. "Wow," he said. "That was awesome. Let's do something more now, I'm still kind of sore down there." I smiled and moved his lips to mine. He moved it to my lower chest, sucking on his own nipple, before I pushed my tongue into his mouth and pulled away.</p> <p>"I'd love to do it some more," he said. "I think it's so amazing that a woman can just be on fire from sex all the time, in and out. But I really like your ass!"</p> <p>I laughed and pulled him toward me. "Oh, don't get any ideas.
