Björn had his hand in my hair, guiding me up and down on his member while he pulled harder on my hair. He let me go and leaned back against the counter. He reached around and grabbed a handful of my waist, and pushed me down on the work bench. I felt his hands pulling my shirt off of me. Then he pulled it out from around my neck, exposing my breasts. Björn reached down and undid the clasp of my bra. He pulled it off of me, and let it fall to the floor, followed by my bra. He was still pulling my hair to get the shirt out of my pants, when he reached around me and undid the button at the middle of my bikini pants, then pushed them and my underwear down to the floor. Then he pulled off my panty and pulled me towards him toward the work bench. He grabbed my hips and pushed me hard against the bench, causing me to collapse backward. The hard wood scratched at my back, leaving a trail in its wake. Björn moved forward and wrapped his hands around my stomach and my breasts, squeezing them as hard as he could. Suddenly he lifted me onto the edge, which was only about one foot or so from the bench. My legs hitched as I laid back into the edge. Without another word, he grabbed my wrist and guided my hands to the top of the bench. As he sat in the end position, my hands went through the crack of my lower back, which was only about two or three inches above the front. We were still just about at eye-fucking height. I opened my eyes and saw him looking at me, holding my eyes closed with his hands, and smiling.</p> <p>"Do you want some lube?"</p> <p>"Please?" I begged, and he nodded his head.</p> <p>I grabbed both arms and pulled them up to my shoulders, and then to my upper chest to hook them. He knelt there, looking at me all in my face. He spread my legs and gently moved his head to my sex, running the flat of his tongue from my clit down between my lips. I closed my eyes and moaned, letting my head drop back a bit as he slid a finger into me. His tongue flicked me again. I moaned and arched my back.</p> <p>I heard him give a groan of satisfaction as he slid his finger out of me and stood up. He took my hand. He led me to the work bench, where he set me on it with my legs still hanging over.</p> <p>Björn quickly undid his pants and pulled them off, and began to rub his erection with my hand, letting me get a look at it. I ran my hand down to it, slowly stroking its length. He was not a heavy, but enough that the head was visible and it had a different texture when I touched it. He moved around in front of me, but he remained in the same sitting position, kneeling in front of me. He grabbed my hands, and put them over my head.</p> <p>"Put your other hand on my cock, " he said, and I felt my fingers touch his balls, which were so soft and curly - they were smooth against my fingers. I grabbed them, and started to slide up and down his shaft. As I squeezed, I could feel his cock throb at the touch of my skin. He then stood up.</p> <p>"I think you need to rest". He moved to a corner where we could both lie down. His hard erection was pointing straight up.</p> <p>"I'm not going to sleep just this once", he said.</p> <p>"Then you can be quiet", I responded. He moved onto his back, his legs out from underneath him. He pushed my shirt off over my head. It fell around my back, leaving me naked. He then grabbed both of my arms.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p> <p>I nodded and he began to move them together, with my feet on either side of him. He began to kiss me down the center of my body, from the back to below my breasts. His hands cupped my breasts, taking them in his strong hands. A tingling ran through me as his hands slid over me, touching the soft flesh of my back. I could feel his hard flesh pressing against my cheeks. He lifted his head and began to kiss me again, slowly moving his way down to the area between my breasts and my navel. As he did he began to squeeze them from behind, letting his lips meet mine and start to kiss—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
