I'm going to take pictures of it," he said, and I was shocked, not really expecting this.</p> <p>"I don't know, you don't seem to want to do that," I said. Maybe he wanted more because of the way I was dressed, and I didn't really know what to say.</p> <p>"Why not? We'll just start off as lovers. Or as friends after all. Okay?"</p> <p>The first time it was with him really, really, it took my breath away, but it was the first time I ever thought about him like that. "Okay. I guess that settles it, at least for the moment. But right now, let's start with kissing."</p> <p>He kissed me for a minute or so, lingering on my lips.</p> <p>"We've been friends forever, and I don't think that I'm ready to take this to the next level yet. But I don't want it to end yet," he said.</p> <p>And kissing took a turn, sort of... I could have gone there, as a friend. But kiss? It was nice, even after what I'd found out.</p> <p>He was a good kisser, too. It wasn't a great kisser, and even if it was good, it wasn't that. It was more... I was kind of worried I'd just ended up with my head in his lap, and he'd gone home.</p> <p>Then we started kissing again, and it was nice. He was a really good kisser. I liked that. The kissing turned me on a little. But then we had to stop, and I couldn't do it all the way.</p> <p>We kissed some more. He broke away from me, and I thought this was going to end. It didn't. I kept my head down, and he started kissing down my neck, and he started going lower. I thought I should stop him, but this was really turning me on. I sort of wanted it to end, but it wasn't. He sucked on my collarbone and started to kiss it, while his hand came up to my breast and started undoing the strings of my top. I thought I could stop if I wanted to, but oh-so-silly-that just added to my feeling of excitement.</p> <p>I felt a little disappointed, when he pulled my top off, and I thought it was all over, but then he pulled my clothes off, and I felt them being pushed down my body. He slid his hand up under my tank top and my bra, and he started playing with one of my nipples, and then the other. It was all nice, but I still said I couldn't do it. No, I couldn't, he was my best boyfriend ever, and this was going to end so I wouldn't make a mess. He stopped, and then pulled my straps down from my shoulders, and then my bra off, and then he did the same to my panties.</p> <p>We started kissing again, and I was starting to get excited. He kissed down my neck, and when he started to suck on one of my breasts, it felt really good, a little strange. I hadn't noticed before, or maybe I was just thinking it was nice.</p> <p>He put his lips on my nipple, and it made me really, really hot. I was already starting to get a little excited just from that. Then he pulled it gently, and the feeling was better. Oh god, I was getting a little excited, I just needed more of it. I wanted him to suck more, I wanted him to put his hand down there to feel how wet I was.</p> <p>But he didn't. He just stayed there for a bit, sucking my nipple, then he pulled slowly, and I wasn't sure he could take it, and I wasn't sure he could take it. But I knew if he kept it up for a bit longer, I'd be going crazy. He pulled his hand away, and I thought he may have been a little disappointed, because he went back to sucking my tits, but there was just a little bit of disappointment. He just kept going. I could feel myself getting more turned on, I just wanted more, more of his attention, I wanted him to suck on my nipples, I wanted him to move around and play with them, and I wanted him to squeeze them gently.</p> <p>I really wanted to stop, not just so we'd do it more, but for real. He stopped, and then took my hand to help me to my feet, and then I helped pull him up to me, and kissed him. I kissed him to shut him up, and then to show we weren't done. I just needed more kissing, so I let him pull off my undies, and he pulled out his erection and was slowly rubbing itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
