I'm just glad we didn't have to leave her." She wiped her tears with a handful of cloth. "I'm sure her family will find out what is going on and the best way to deal with it."</p> <p>He gave a brief sigh and took off looking in the woods looking for other small towns nearby, all the ways were possible. They had been traveling for three nights, leaving the old farm town to the wild life, the river, the mountains. It had seemed so long ago that they could just remember it.</p> <p>He looked at her and she wiped her fingers over her face.</p> <p>"What if I tell them that I left you to die?" She was smiling now and she kissed him on his temple as a reward.</p> <p>"If you die." He said. "When I tell them I'm going to have to kill the bastard, he'll kill me as a trophy." He laughed and she gave him a kiss that lasted a bit longer.</p> <p>"What happened with his father?" He asked. "Did it cause him to kill you?" He looked at her questioningly.</p> <p>"He was a good man." She said softly. "He was my father. He wanted the best for me, and the best was the same for all of us." She paused and looked down as she said this and she wiped her cheeks again.</p> <p>"You want that?" He asked. She nodded and kissed him on his forehead. "I'm sure I can see if you've got anything left of the father of my brother." She smiled. She never got the feeling that all men who have had some form of connection with other men that didn't get to be as a man had had that relationship.</p> <p>*********************************************</p> <p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Beth asked as she sat on the bench looking up at the moon, it was a full moon, it was the first night of the summer. "I've been watching her, thinking that maybe I should know. I mean she didn't say she was leaving you, she didn't look for a husband."</p> <p>"I wanted to keep you safe, I love you more than any girl I've ever been with." He said.</p> <p>"That's not true."</p> <p>She shook her head slowly and looked back up. "I'm sorry." She said. "I was mad at myself for letting you go and that's why I haven't told your father, to put him in his place, to keep him from thinking that you were doing the wrong thing, but you and I are now my husband, I love you forever, I'm not leaving you, just let him do all the work."</p> <p>He nodded and looked back down at the ground. He smiled as he looked at her.</p> <p>"And why wasn't you here with me, why didn't you say anything about leaving when you were still my girlfriend?" he said.</p> <p>"I don't know. He didn't want to talk to me and he's never coming back, he just wanted me to know that it was you I loved that he was unhappy, and that it was me he loved."</p> <p>"Then why didn't you just say no?" He asked as he looked up at the dark moon.</p> <p>"I guess I'd do that for a friend if you did." She said sadly. "So what else are you doing tonight? I've got a lot of homework to do today and I thought I'd ask you about it."</p> <p>"What else do you want? We're going to be in bed all night, I can have you home by midnight or tomorrow." He said as he reached out and took her hand in his. "Come on, get up. We have some studying to do tomorrow."</p> <p>"I don't want to, I'm just not ready for that." She said.</p> <p>"I don't have the answers yet." He said truthfully. "If you think you need them, give them to me. If you think I want you there too, give me a hug."</p> <p>He put his hand up and she gave him a little hug. She was a lovely young woman. He reached up and gave her his cheek.</p> <p>"If that's what you want, I'll do that."</p> <p>"Oh, that would be awesome." She said smiling as she looked at him.</p> <p>"I know you don't want to go that far, you've never done that before, but you had to take the chance." He said.</p> <p>"I didn't think you would ever say that, it's just that..."</p> <p>He looked down at her, she didn't say anything. He knew she didn't eitherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
