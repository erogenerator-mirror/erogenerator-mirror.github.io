It feels great." With that Melissa walked past him into the closet. She was dressed up for the occasion, too.</p> <p>"Just leave the blouse and shorts on for now." Melissa said as she entered the closet.</p> <p>"Thanks, sweetie. I'll make it up to you in a couple of days, too."</p> <p>"Don't worry. You have your own room. I'll take care of everything in the morning. Okay?" Melissa asked, a warm smile on her face.</p> <p>"That's very thoughtful of you," John responded, giving Melissa a gentle hug. "Thank you for thinking about me."</p> <p>Melissa pulled her clothes back on, and walked out of the bedroom, leaving her husband alone and naked on the bed with his face buried in her bush. She felt a strange sensation in her chest as she pulled the shirt over her head, and stood there, trying to decide if it was appropriate to strip naked for her husband, before she'd start calling him by his nubile name again later tonight. Was it wrong? What if he didn't want to see her naked?</p> <p>***</p> <p>Chapter two:</p> <p>"Heather, you're going to be spending the next couple of weeks getting ready for what's to come!" Heather informed Melissa on Thursday morning as they lay exhausted in their bed after her husband's recent, lengthy lovemaking session with her daughter.</p> <p>"What?" Melissa asked, wondering why Heather had asked.</p> <p>"I thought we might both get laid again tonight."</p> <p>"I haven't been fucked for almost a week." Melissa laughed, feeling her stomach turn as Heather took her hand and placed it on her husband's limp member. "But, I don't want to go that far again, just for a couple of days, you know? So I want you to promise to wear this nightgown for me."</p> <p>She saw his confusion for a heartbeat as she continued to stroke his dick. "This is where you cum, too, honey. In my nightgown. So I want you to wear this nightgown just for tonight."</p> <p>With that she threw her arms around her husband's neck and kissed him. "Will you really do this?"</p> <p>"I don't know," he answered. "I mean, my sister said you were a good kisser. It feels so good when we kiss like this."</p> <p>"And maybe we can make it better. But, I have to go and make sure everything's ready for tonight," she said. "I'm going to shower. And I just needed to change into something."</p> <p>"I'm all yours," John responded.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The next morning, Heather had prepared some breakfast and they had their breakfast. John, in the meantime, had made himself a cup of coffee and went upstairs. When he got back, he found Heather laying on the bed, naked, reading him a chapter. The sight of her made him feel so horny and so happy for her, he knew he would have sex or two with her again very soon. His cock began to throb in his boxers as he watched her, with her nipples poking out and her eyes closed.</p> <p>Heather got up and went to the bathroom in a sexy robe that came to mid-thigh. She was wearing her robe for the evening, in effect a robe, as she turned down the bathtub and sat down. Her left hand went down between her legs, playing with her pussy, while she began to stroke her left breast. John watched her finger her pussy, and his stiff cock was pulsing as he watched her.</p> <p>After a minute or two, Heather turned to him for a kiss. "Do you like what you see, John?" Heather asked with a devilish grin as her hand slowly made its way to his stiff dick.</p> <p>"I...I don't know, darling. It's too much!"</p> <p>"There must be something wrong with you. You've had plenty to drink today, haven't you?" Heather teased as she slid her hand down his body, leaving it just above the knee.</p> <p>John watched with a smile as she squeezed his dick. "I hope you're feeling more than just a little turned-on," she teased. "Let's make a start of something."</p> <p>Heather got on her knees in front of him. She reached up and undid his shorts and removed them all, then pulled his cock out and began to stroke it. "Is this what you want, baby? Is that what you really want? To have a man in your mouth while you are stroking him?" She stroked her hands up and down his shaft and took his entire knob between her lips.</p> <p>Heather sucked him deeper into her mouth, her lips pressing against his pubes as she sucked. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
