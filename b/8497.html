He was a big man with a strong muscular frame, he was wearing an old fashioned gold chain that made him look very respectable looking, his suit jacket and trousers accentuated his muscular shoulders and arms. That was the only time I'd ever thought that he was very handsome. But that day when we had all gone to dinner the night before, he looked as if he looked too old and frail, then he smiled as if he saw some of his late years in me, all the while still the same old, tired old man who'd been gone for days. There were many different types of men, all ages and with an odd kind of vitality, his smile was infectious. He was the last of the old boys to cross in that line.</p> <p>"What's it to you, you bastard?" I shouted, "I'm going home."</p> <p>"Oh, no, you're not," he replied, "The evening has ended. I'm staying in London until I can clear up as much as I can, I'm not making a habit of it and if you're interested again, you can come to my flat tonight and we can come up to my room and I'll explain it to you later," his tone was so light it was hard to make out what he wanted.</p> <p>"I'd love to," I said, "But that's not possible right now."</p> <p>"What? I think you should stay and visit the flat with me," he said confidently. I thought for a moment.</p> <p>"I'm not going to let Mr. Jollity's girlfriend be seen with me," I added. "I'm sure that there are some people who are going to notice me," he said as I held him at arm's length and pointed to the row of doors at his side. "Perhaps if you like?"</p> <p>"No, really, you're not, you know," he said, "I really don't want to get in trouble, I'm not going to stay after I've finished with you."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I said. "After all, that's what she did on Tuesday." I thought about how stupid that had been; she had wanted to stay all day with me and to my obvious embarrassment she'd kissed him and was fondling his cock. I thought that he had been as hard as that was, at least, as much as I had been. I wondered if I should take him back home for a fortnight or something, for he was in no position to get married. I could always call him and we could meet to discuss future arrangements. But I could never marry or be with a man. I was sorry that I'd gone from trying hard to please him to just staying away from him. I should have just left. I should have told him to leave me alone, I should have waited for him to arrive, should have given him the chance to apologise, but no, it didn't happen, I told myself. He deserved better than that.</p> <p>"There you are," I smiled.</p> <p>"Now where were we?" he asked, "Why don't you go and see Mr. Jollity's flat and see if you can find him a nice, old man, or a suitable young student for you to see what you can't be!"</p> <p>For the first time in a long time I felt proud of myself and it made a horrible feeling of jealousy. I suppose I looked it as well, it was a look of triumph when Mr. Jollity's girlfriend was just toying with him. I walked out of the hotel on my own, into the darkness of a gloomy little street. I took a few steps and then leaned over the rail to look down onto his flat. It didn't look very good. The walls were painted a dark, grimy pale red and the lights had gone on too long, it was dark on the ground floor, on one wall was an open door with a man on the bed and another woman on the other side of it. The door was open and I could also see that there were dark windows which were also open and I could still make out the figure of a young girl who sat on the bed and I could see she wasn't only naked but also wearing a white negligee as she lay on top of the young man on the bed, her long legs pulled up over his shoulders and ankles tied to the corners of the bed with long white and very black silk scarves. The girl looked like a very old woman, her hair flowing over her shoulders and down her back. She was all young, yet with the sort of youthful attractiveness that was difficult to find at home in a city as it was in London.</p> <p>"You may be shocked and hurt," she said, "But I've been with the girl of your dreams, I do believe you told us on Tuesday that you liked blondes and I guessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
