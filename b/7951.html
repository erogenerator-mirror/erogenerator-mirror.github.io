She gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and then headed off towards her office. I sat there wondering what I had gotten myself into and how I was going to pay her for it. I had always thought her husband was a dirty old man, a pervert, but he'd never complained. I felt like a slut but at the same time the thought that I hadn't been faithful to my husband in some place, anything, and that it had meant what it did to me as well just scared the hell out of me. Why else did it have to make me feel like she did? I had wanted this so much then I had felt so pathetic.</p> <p>I had come home to the same house with the same room. I had known it would be different but as soon as I had seen her in that skirt she had felt so much more naked then I had. She had been a perfect wife. She had always been a natural blonde, beautiful but I had always thought she was a little plain. I hadn't been surprised when, the summer she had told me how turned on she got thinking about me was, had she told me about the sex toy? I had felt her hands and fingers all over my body, her kisses and bites, her fingers on my breast, her sweet pussy. She had seemed to like it and she loved me to take control in our bedroom.</p> <p>I couldn't believe how she had started this, I hadn't expected she would be so forceful with me. Her whole attitude, her attitude, it had taken me a little over a year to realize this was where I belonged. It had taken a lot of courage to go that far. I had tried to see if maybe if I kept looking under my arm for something that was more fulfilling to her than just an excuse to be with her. When I did finally look under the other side of the other side to where my arm was I almost cried. I felt like I must have been the only one on earth that didn't know how to take it. I saw her in a way that was so beautiful that I just wanted to be the center of her pleasure. That is why I always felt this way so much. I loved her, but right then it just wasn't right. She loved me like I loved her, yet she also loved me when we were together. I was only too glad that she had finally come home and taken responsibility for me.</p> <p>I heard the front door open and then her footsteps go upstairs. I wanted so badly to hear her tell me that she loved me instead of just talking about how it was so wrong for me to get married. I wanted to hear her say it to make it more important than it was, but as soon as she got into her bedroom there she was. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I had never seen her undress except in the shower, but I never thought she was sexy at all. From that day on I had never heard from her again. I wanted to be able to talk to her in a way that only she could. I just wanted to hear the words that she spoke. I wanted to know what it was that she felt right for saying, so I could ask her to move in with me. I wanted to know what she did when it was all over. I wanted to hear what she did when she was done with me.</p> <p>I sat there staring at the floor, and when she came down the stairs, my heart couldn't take any more and I started to feel nervous. I was almost overwhelmed by how much more beautiful she truly was. As I looked at her every thought I had of me came back to me. I wanted to be with her as much as she wanted me. Her smile was contagious because of that. I wanted to be with her all the time. I didn't feel anything about her as she came into the house, but I was a little relieved when she showed up in the middle of the evening. I still felt bad that she didn't see me with her parents; it probably wouldn't have been fun if she hadn't made the suggestion that she wanted a room on our own.</p> <p>I was nervous that I would say it right away but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I don't remember anything that night even when I was so excited about trying my best to stay away from her at first. She was like the woman in the movie Astaria; she never complained or anything. Even when we talked about things, her smile never changed, she never looked uncomfortable with anything either. We talked long enough to get us both used to her at a time. In my opinion it was really only a passing thing. When we finished up there was a big hug in the middle of my room. She seemed just as content as I was. We shared one more kiss before they got cleaned up. I think we both got very excited by itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
