They held their bodies tightly, both breathing hard as well as letting out moans as they made slow slow, sensual circles on her stomach. She could feel them slowly rubbing against her while her hands held him more tightly. Her feet started to run wildly as they got their strength back, and they knew that if they moved, they would both collapse. They were not going to say it again, they were going to try and take it from each other. The orgasms they both felt started to build rapidly as they became aware of the wetness in the middle of their bodies. It hit as their bodies connected and they were locked together in a tight embrace. Her hands slowly ran up along his side.</p> <p>"I feel you with me."</p> <p>"I feel so good with you." He said quietly, letting go of hers.</p> <p>"I feel the same with you, and I feel so wonderful, so alive." They whispered in each other's eyes.</p> <p>Her hands were once more rubbing along his sides. She couldn't get enough of him.</p> <p>"And it feels so good to hold this, and to feel myself getting so warm inside. How did I not notice how wonderful this is for us? I will always be your little princess...you are a good boy, with me to protect your safety. I can never be anything but your protector."</p> <p>"It's about time that he was protected. I don't know if I could handle it." He said as his face was buried in her stomach.</p> <p>"Why don't you just let me go. Do what you want with me and then you want to make love to me. When can I come and when can we go again?" She asked her eyes full of confusion.</p> <p>"In a few minutes honey."</p> <p>"I am going to try to get you there."</p> <p>"If you don't make it to the shower soon."</p> <p>"You better, it took me all night."</p> <p>"You better."</p> <p>She looked in his eyes for just a second too long, there was a look but there was nothing there. He moved to take his shorts off. He stood up and they embraced and kissed and he started to rub her legs. She spread them as far as she could, feeling his hand sliding along her thigh. She moved her legs open a bit more and she felt a gentle touch from his hands, she could not imagine how that felt to him since they were just a couple, but this felt completely different. It was a lot closer to the center of her universe and there was nothing else except their skin touching as a bond was formed between them. Her legs opened a bit more as one hand caressed over her body and the other started to move up and down. She could feel himself getting harder. His hands made more of a push against her lower torso than were her legs and she thought, I can't be enjoying this this much!</p> <p>He moved his hands to her hips and moved them over her back and neck. He started by kissing her neck lightly just above her collarbone, and then slowly moved his way down to kiss her there with the kiss. He moved his hands back to her hips so that they were now in control of her body while his legs kept her there. It was like a dream coming true. But his kiss was different from mine. He moved his kisses down her neck, nibbled the skin along the sides of her collarbone and moved onto the back of her neck. He started to move his kisses down her chest, his hands still holding her breasts, while his lips moved towards her stomach. She felt his tongue slowly make its way around her belly button. He moved his mouth down, licking the skin as he moved down.</p> <p>He took her panties with one hand and moved her feet apart. He kissed her thigh and his mouth moved up to her mound. He kissed her there for a minute while his tongue continued its magic, moving from her lips all the way to her clit and back again. It seemed like forever for them, but he still didn't relent. He moved his tongue inside her and licked up towards her button, then back again. She looked down at his head moving up and down over her. She placed her hands on his head and stroked her legs under his hand, feeling the power, and the control of this man that she had dreamt about for many years. She wanted more, more than anything else. He continued to please her as his hand continued to caress her.</p> <p>"I want you" She said with a voice so that it sounded like "Fuck me"</p> <p>He felt her legs open wider and his mouth moved into her pussy. He started to lick up and down. He couldn't believe how it felt to please her. He stopped just to suck on her clit as his hands movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
