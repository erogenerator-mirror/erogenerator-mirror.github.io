I went to college and I ended up married and living with some pretty hot married lady for three years. It was the third year and then I started to lose interest in sex and was thinking about getting into the swinging game and swinging. Before I turned thirty I started to fantasize about swinging. I really enjoyed it but never got to experience it with someone else before. That's another fantasy for later on. Here I am thinking about the last couple of years; fucking my best friend's mother, her husband, and fucking his wife before we got married. I think we did it all. That doesn't happen often. I think it was the happiest time for me so that I might get more free time. It's nice to just live a little. I guess I was beginning to understand what I'm missing out on.</p> <p>"We had a good start-up business that has been growing over the years. We have a business manager. I have one executive that is very successful. He lets us set all kinds of things up. I like a company that wants to do something to the client so I go to my office everyday to look through their records and make a decision for them. I know it sounds like it sounds easy but I really don't know how to do the things I am doing at my office. It's the money that really bothers me. Anyway, you know how it is. I'm not that bad. I am just a little older. I have been divorced from that man for about five years. He moved east and we never got together. We both decided he was too busy and didn't want to have to move back east. We had no money left and we just didn't have the resources to put down roots. I think he wanted me to meet him some time before I moved back. I think it worked out for both of us.</p> <p>"So many months ago we met for coffee in a coffee shop. He's married and they are starting to get serious about swinging. He said that his sex life has improved."</p> <p>"Wow. Why have you never acted on it?"</p> <p>"For a long time now. I'm not that interested. I just feel like it's cheating. I would like to try it in my office or with someone else but that would be cheating."</p> <p>"Why not. Why would you want to do it here? It's a private house and we don't meet people from out of town."</p> <p>"Well, I guess I'm in luck tonight because he wanted me to come and meet you. Anyway, he said it would give me a chance to get some things straightened out. He was right. My husband is a lousy lay and I don't think he would be this good at it. He is quite skilled and I can see that the next time we meet could be good. Let's have a few drinks, if you like."</p> <p>"It would be fun with the company. I'm not sure I can think of anyplace where we are going to have more than one drink."</p> <p>"It seems like a very good idea. So, you're still in town? I'll grab a cab and we can meet and have a drink on the way home."</p> <p>"That would be great," she replied. "I have got to go before the morning is up."</p> <p>I was surprised by the way she talked to me. It was not like she was trying to get me drunk. In fact, she was acting like a good young lady with some company. I could relate to her. For a while I was thinking about just sitting and drinking in private with her but now that the chance for sex with someone that I had just met was almost sure.</p> <p>"You just go right ahead and have a drink. I'll see you at work tomorrow. Don't hang out. You have your own car. It's right over there."</p> <p>"Thank you." She smiled.</p> <p>The evening went off without a hitch. We both started feeling a little tipsy so we had to change. We took our suitcases to my place. I asked her to pick it out. I had brought my wife's dress on that day and my wife had picked out her dress.</p> <p>When she got in the cab she made no attempt to hide the fact that she was interested in swinging. When we arrived at the house I immediately made a big show of looking around. She couldn't take it anymore. She was ready to make an offer with the most outrageous proposal ever. We left the taxi and went to my home office.</p> <p>We had dinner together and then went to my favorite restaurant for the night. We finished dinner and left after a while. A few minutes later she said, "I'm not sure where to go next."</p> <p>"I could drop you there soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
