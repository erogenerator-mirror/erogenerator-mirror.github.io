I hope you will make it in time.' he said as he took your face in his hands and kissed you gently, a quick peck on the lips as well.</p> <p>You feel his hands take hold of the collar of your robe and then slip it off, along with your robe.</p> <p>He holds you there for a moment, admiring you as you stand there, slowly beginning to put on your robe again.</p> <p>You feel the robe being pulled off you, revealing your body to him, your breasts heaving as the feeling of having nothing is making it all more exciting. He kneels down and leans forward so he can take one and then the other of them into his mouth.</p> <p>My hand slides over your body as he caresses you, making you feel so very excited. Your breathing is heavy as I reach my hands up and begin to rub you back and forth across your body, making it ache with need and need for him.</p> <p>You start to feel like a woman with him, the sensations your body feels are making you feel in every inch of your body. He stands up before you and moves closer to you, making sure his body can come close to you.</p> <p>He reaches out and takes hold of your arms, pulling them down to behind your back, allowing it completely to fall off your body.</p> <p>You feel it falling, slowly against your back and as you feel the material of your robe fall away, leaving you exposed to him completely.</p> <p>You are so excited now... You want to show him how much he means to you, how much he means to you. Your body wants to give that control and it's getting very, very wet. His hands move over your stomach as they begin to slide up and down, caressing you lightly, making the slightest movements feel nice and easy.</p> <p>Your heart is racing, you want to give yourself to him completely at that instant. The soft material of your robe has just become almost completely open and a breeze is starting to caress you. You can't resist a sigh that follows the soft caress as your head lowers slowly, so slowly, allowing his body to feel the way it wants you, so very.</p> <p>With his hands resting lightly on your back, you feel him gently pushing it down, your body following his.</p> <p>The feel of the material is a tease for you as you feel it hit the base of your spine in just the right way, making your body shiver and tingle with desire.</p> <p>The movement of the piece of fabric over your back, pulling the edges together, making your nipples feel even more sensitive than they were when she had been touching them. My fingers slide up your back to run around your sides, to start gently kneading them, feeling the silkiness of your robe brushing the underside of his fingers.</p> <p>He leans in close to your body, his hands now going all the way around your hips to your hips, his fingers wrapping around your waist.</p> <p>'Oh my pet... You are so beautiful... so very sensual... I can't wait to have you... I need to have you..." his words coming with such a slow edge as he starts to feel your breasts as he leans in to kiss you, to suck the softest of those sweet pusslips.</p> <p>Your body feels so warm and erotic again as you feel his lips moving down the front of your body to your thighs, letting his tongue run all along it, letting his hot breath tease your body. He makes it last as he gently bites your left thigh at the bottom, so you can't help but arch up as he gives it a soft kiss.</p> <p>You feel yourself wanting to cum so badly again as his mouth finally meets your wet lips and he devours you fully, making yourself feel so damn good, his tongue sliding in and out in your cunt from the top to inside, making every nerve on your body shiver as it touches you, making your stomach rise and drop.</p> <p>You don't care anymore about what anyone says, because you're so close now, so very close to cumming for him... so very close!</p> <p>You have to hold him, no, make him wait, wait for him, let him wait for you so that you're always there for himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
