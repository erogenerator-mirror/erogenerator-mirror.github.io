He looked into her eyes with a strange look. She opened her mouth a bit to accommodate him and then moved back up.</p> <p>"I need to go," she said.</p> <p>"Okay," he said. "I'll go wash my hands."</p> <p>He went to the bathroom quickly and came back and looked in a few moments. She was dressed in a white blouse and a blue skirt. She had on a long, black hair, the sort that can be worn up in the middle of a day. He couldn't see anything from the streetlight or the ground. He glanced at his wallet. It was a pair of hundred dollar bills.</p> <p>He looked back at her with a strange look on his face.</p> <p>"I told you I didn't pay for your clothes," he said.</p> <p>She blushed. "I'm not dressed to go out." She reached up and touched her face with both hands. "I'm not ready to accept money from those guys who say no. I mean, it's my job. I'm not as dumb as some of your friends, they think I'm some kind of slut."</p> <p>He laughed nervously. "What about your underwear?"</p> <p>She nodded, "There's a difference. I'm not as naked as them."</p> <p>He started to unbutton his pants after pulling aside the elastic. She moved to help him. His dick was already springing in front of her. Her eyes were still on it but she was looking at it not at it. He dropped his pants and she grabbed him in her grip. She pumped his penis a few times and then pulled back a bit. She looked into his eyes, "I want you to fuck me with it," she said.</p> <p>He looked at her then. Her eyes were on fire and her face looked as if she could be about to burst into a thousand pieces.</p> <p>"Okay," he shrugged, looking down at himself, his balls resting on his thighs. He turned to face her again. "You sure you want to do this?" he said.</p> <p>"No," she said. "Just like I said, you know you want this."</p> <p>He raised his hands to slide the straps off her shoulders. She reached behind herself to unzip her skirt. He slid it down the soft silk of her body and moved back up to rest on her shoulders. Then he reached up her skirt and cupped her ass. She shivered.</p> <p>"What's happening to me?" she said.</p> <p>"I'm just helping to make you horny," he replied.</p> <p>"I don't know if I can handle any more," she said, "This is too uncomfortable."</p> <p>He kissed her cheek lightly. "It's fine."</p> <p>He pushed her back onto the rug and got between her legs on his knees. He rubbed the head of his dick up and down the wet lips of her pussy. He paused as the tip found the little bud of her hood. She squirmed and whimpered. He looked into her eyes and leaned forward, taking that little pearl between his teeth. She moaned and spread her legs even wider. Then he pushed down onto her, his entire length plunging inside her. They both gasped for air. Sweat dripped off of them. Her breasts, the size of basketballs, bounced in the air as he started to fuck her. He was a good lover. He was a good fuck.</p> <p>"Oh God," she screamed.</p> <p>He had one hand on her hip holding himself so deep within her that her cervix seemed to be resting against the base of his penis. He felt her orgasm ripple through her body. He started to thrust faster into her. His own penis was stiff. He moved his own hand to fondle her breasts.</p> <p>"Are you ready, honey?" he asked.</p> <p>"I want to feel you come inside me. Come inside me," she moaned lustfully, "I want you to cum inside me."</p> <p>He knew he was pumping her pussy with his cock. In fact, he was pushing it up against her and pushing it in and out of her. She was so wet that he could even feel her juices on his dick. She was milking the orgasm out of him. Her hands were on his hips, holding onto him. She wanted him to move faster and move deeper into her. He started to thrust his hips to meet her. The contact felt amazing. The feeling of friction was like nothing he'd ever experienced. Her pussy gripped at his penis like a velvet fist and he felt her whole body tremble. Then he came too, his own orgasm surging into her. She started to cum herself at the same time he did.</p> <p>They collapsedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
