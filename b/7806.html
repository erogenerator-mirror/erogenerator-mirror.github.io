I could hear him sigh a little, and knew he was enjoying the show I was putting on for his benefit.</p> <p>”Why don’t you put it aside, and let me give it a good rub,” I called out to him in a playful tone.</p> <p>I stood up, and reached under my skirt, my hand slowly lifting it to my waist. My legs felt so weak, and I began to feel wetness coming from a source of warmth. I slipped my hand down and began to move it slowly around my hips, pulling down on my dress to expose the smooth skin on the inside of my thighs. I began to touch up with my fingertips, feeling my way up to my panties, and pushing the material into her opening. I teased it a little, and slid my finger up and down my slit, teasing her some more, my fingertip moving faster over my clit as I rubbed her. My breathing had gotten a little ragged and I felt the warmth in my pussy intensify, the wetness increasing with each passing moment. I pushed all the way down, and let my finger rub in a circle around my clit, bringing it back up, and rubbing it again. I could feel my orgasm beginning but I was going to cum again, and I wanted to make myself come on his face, this time around his cock. I pulled my finger away from my pussy, and placed both hands palm up on the head, my fingers gently cupping the underside of my balls. My eyes were closed, and I felt it, it began moving up and down like a piston on a bicycle. I was starting to come, and my ass moved in circles on the sofa cushions, rubbing it, pressing my asshole hard against the cool leather. I was sweating, and I had a wet patch on the sofa, dripping down my leg. I tried to stop the trembling in my hands, but could feel my stomach muscles begin to spasm. Every muscle in my body tightened, squeezing and releasing my body as my ass moved in a circle.</p> <p>“I’m going to cum”, I mouthed to myself in my little girl voice. I thought it was just the way women had to speak for me, and I just kept on moving my ass against my hand. My ass was a thing of beauty now. I felt it tighten around my finger as I rubbed my pussy, and the first wave of my orgasm shook my body. I began moaning softly, and then louder as I moved my hand up and down my swollen clit, still trying to catch my breath. Suddenly, it began to slowly move back to the center, and I felt the liquid begin to ooze out of my pussy all along its length. My own orgasm seemed to start at its start, as soon as my body slowed my hand could feel mine start to spasm once more. As I was trying to pull my body back from the orgasm, I felt him push it up with his finger. I opened my eyes and looked down, my hair falling at my face. I could see him sitting there, his face turned to be still, as he stroked himself. I looked away. I had gone too far, and now, the whole world was watching, in my own way. This is what it’s all about, I thought to myself, and I was right. I looked again, and saw my hand slowly moving up and down, the wetness glistening on both of my hands. Slowly I closed my eyes again, and felt my body begin to relax. I opened my eyes, and looked at the clock on the wall behind my head. I wondered how I could have gone so long without him watching me. I turned my head towards him, and smiled. ”Good night,” I mouthed at him to me.</p> <p>”Good night,” he said, not even trying to hide the smile. I smiled back, and walked towards the bathroom to clean up my mess. I had no idea where I would go for the next two nights—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
