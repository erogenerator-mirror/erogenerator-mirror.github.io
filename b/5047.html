What's your point?"</p> <p>"You'd let them do anything, and that's it."</p> <p>"Is that true?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good. So, I guess it would be like that?"</p> <p>"Exactly, Mom. Do you know a guy you could let fuck my brains out?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"You'd fuck my brains out? I know more than that!"</p> <p>"I'm sure you do, Mom."</p> <p>She laughed. "Well, we're just kidding around and I'll bet that no man on God's green earth has ever done that to you!"</p> <p>"Well, maybe they've made out with their girlfriends in high school and on the way to college. Why not? And, if it's what you want, I'll always love you for it."</p> <p>"We'll just have to wait and see, son."</p> <p>"I hope so."</p> <p>"I'm getting to that."</p> <p>He turned the lights off, put his robe on, and slipped back into bed. "Night, Mom! If you want to wait and see, just tell me." He kissed his way to bed and lay beside her. "Night, sweetheart."</p> <p>"Night, sweetheart."</p> <p>+++++</p> <p>When he awoke, he heard her quietly singing, but it wasn't a happy tune.</p> <p>"What did you do to me? What do you think you were doing?"</p> <p>"I'm going down on you and if there's anything else, I'll blow you in the shower."</p> <p>"You're not doing anything!"</p> <p>"It's my pussy and I'm going to do it."</p> <p>"You're kidding! I'm going down on you?"</p> <p>"I'm going to blow your brains out!"</p> <p>"Good for you. You've got a wicked tongue, aren't you? I bet you could suck cock."</p> <p>"It wasn't like that, Sweetheart. Don't give your mother what she doesn't know!"</p> <p>"It doesn't matter!"</p> <p>He tried to kiss her, but she batted it away. "No! Don't touch me."</p> <p>He tried, but she pushed him away.</p> <p>"Stop being a baby!"</p> <p>Then, when the words didn't stop coming out of his mouth, he said, "I'm not a baby."</p> <p>"That's the wrong answer."</p> <p>"I'm not a baby, Mom!"</p> <p>"There, there. It's better this way."</p> <p>He looked up, and she was looking into his eyes. "Do you really think I'm a baby?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good, I'm a baby in love with your father and with him I'm a baby in love with you, too."</p> <p>"Not in love either!"</p> <p>"Of course not."</p> <p>"Don't tell me that!"</p> <p>"But you are my father!"</p> <p>"I told you, I meant it!"</p> <p>He sat up, and she said, "But you're not supposed to."</p> <p>"I'm not supposed to say anything!"</p> <p>"It's a sin!"</p> <p>"Are you going to kiss me? If you are, kiss me first. Are you sure you know how to kiss a woman?"</p> <p>"I'm just asking you to do it, Sweetheart."</p> <p>"It's just that it's not right."</p> <p>"It may not make any difference, but if you don't kiss me, then I'll kiss Dad."</p> <p>"Then I'm going to kiss you, Mom, and get you all hot and bothered before you let him fuck the hell out of you!"</p> <p>"Well, I don't have a condom, son. You're on."</p> <p>"I'll take that as a challenge."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Not if it means I have to get a mouth on you, too."</p> <p>There was more to come, after that. She got up from bed and found her robe.</p> <p>"Don't put on that robe!"</p> <p>"I'll go get undressed."</p> <p>"What a bunch of lies!"</p> <p>"Oh, you're just jealous, aren't you!"</p> <p>"Well I'm not a bunch of lies, sweetheart."</p> <p>++++++</p> <p>I've been busy since that evening at the party at the gym. I'll get off soon. Bye!"</p> <p>I had been home for hoursâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
