She asked.</p> <p>"For you to learn."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>She was still walking very casually. "It's for your head." I said.</p> <p>"Can't it just be so easy? Now, all you need to do is concentrate on that task until you decide it's done."</p> <p>"Whatever! Now get on your back and let's get you back to sleep."</p> <p>She looked a little apprehensive, so I sat down on the bed, and pulled her up on top of me. She was so light that I almost never got a hard-on! My cock was pressing up against her abdomen, which she didn't seem to mind. I reached down to her pussy, and slowly rubbed the outside of her slit. She was already moist, but I knew that her clitoris had probably been pierced and that made my mind spin a little. I ran my finger slowly along her slit, and then back up towards her clitoris. Again, she closed her eyes, and I knew she was enjoying this.</p> <p>It was only a matter of seconds before her hips thrust forward, and her sex opened to accept my finger, which easily pushed into her pussy. I worked quickly and with a little trouble, trying to get as much of her vagina as possible into her, but no avail. I didn't think, just focused on the process and trying to get as much of my finger as possible into her vagina. I had no success. I'm fairly sure I heard Julie and Jim in the hallway, and if they looked up, they would have seen us fucking, and a finger was being made in me!</p> <p>She started cumming again, and I could not hold out any longer. I knew that I should have pulled her down, but she said, "Wait." After about 10-15 seconds, I pulled his finger out, and she got off me. She bent down and kissed me. I felt bad about leaving her that way, but she had just about the best and most enjoyable night of my life so far.</p> <p>"I'm sorry for last night, but it was my fault and I don't want to hurt you." She said.</p> <p>"No, don't you like it?" I said. "It was the most wonderful experience of my life. It was good, and I'm not your little, fat, useless brother. That night was special. Just you two having casual sex is so special. I have no reason to ever feel guilty for loving you like that. It was so special in that night that you didn't even think I would do it!"</p> <p>It was then that I saw Julie's eyes open, and it looked as if she got excited. After a moment, she said, "I guess I have a confession to make. Just remember, I'm never interested in a relationship that doesn't have a happy ending. You two were great together!"</p> <p>"We were great together, but we couldn't get enough of each other. We just couldn't get enough of each other." I said, and laughed a bit at her attempt to get me to kiss her. "If we got together, what do you expect?"</p> <p>"That you would make love to me at all? And I don't want to cheat on your father?" She asked. "I'm not sure that's such a good idea."</p> <p>"Come now, we've done the deed! As long as that's not sex, you can always say 'no'." And I got up and lay down on the bed in front of her. With her hand gently guiding mine, I tried to lead her next to me. I got up and stood close to her. "I know I'm not your boyfriend anymore." And I kissed her. I guess I looked at her eyes and saw a bit of confusion. "Would you like to see another woman?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, but it would mean that both of us could kiss." I said smiling while kissing herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
