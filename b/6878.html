I'm a good girl for your training. I'd like to give you a tour of my school, though." She pulled down her skirt, stepped out of it, and stepped into her panties one by one. She handed them to him, he tossed them to her and she stepped into them and turned and put her arms around his shoulders and kissed him on the cheek, then her lips came down, but he didn't press the kiss off and pressed his lips into hers.</p> <p>"Do you want us to leave?" he asked politely. She nodded her head. "We'll come back later, but for now, I'm going to give you a tour of this school. I know how to introduce you to my friends. I know that you can't really go back to home without getting yourself arrested. What do you have to say for yourself today, Mr. Anderson?" He nodded to her.</p> <p>"Can I take your coat, Ms. Henson?" he said it firmly, he'd been looking forward to seeing her again for some time. He held the coat up for her to take and she did, and he reached inside for it and hung it on the coat rack. "This should help keep you warm, it's only 7:45 and I have plenty of time to get you ready in the office. Let me have your coat, too." He opened it for her, but didn't put it on before returning to his seat and leaving her standing in front of the desk and watching him from down the long distance. He waited until she'd moved off the desk, and the coat slid back into place from her shoulders on, and then he looked into her eyes and smiled.</p> <p>"How do you feel today, Ms. Henson?"</p> <p>She smiled back. "This is my first day back, Mr. Anderson." He looked up through his spectacles at the clock. "It is almost one. Do you need for me to call your office by this time tomorrow to report my performance for the quarter?"</p> <p>"You're an amazing engineer, Thomas, I'm proud of you." He leaned forward as he stood. "I'll wait until I've cleared the record before we start the tour over." He closed the door and looked at her as she shook her shoulders and smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you, Mr. Anderson, but I have to be on the phone anyway. I will leave you a note when I'm done." They stood for several minutes and just as he turned to leave, she turned back and put her arms around him and kissed him, her skirt fell back to her waist and she slid her hands down his sides.</p> <p>Her skirt was short enough that the hem rose almost to his hips and he felt it almost touching him. She pulled away. "I want to go back to the apartment, Mr. Anderson. I have to. This is about my freedom, and my job. I don't think I'll be able to go back to being a girl without becoming a girl. You could have made me do anything. And you still haven't even touched me." She looked down at his face and saw he looked puzzled.</p> <p>"Well, what did you have in mind? Will I have to take your coat?" Thomas took her coat, hung it up on the coat rack, slipped it on, he looked her over. Again he checked her out, and wondered how long before he was going to have to. He wasn't in the mood to do her in the office like he did, he wanted to get her to know that it wasn't about the money, and maybe learn something about her. What the heck was he going to do with her? He felt his cock hardening just looking at her.</p> <p>She slipped her hands into his lap and felt his cock through his pants, she felt it swelling. "My skirt is short enough, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, he'd been thinking of just getting to his office and going home and relieving his throbbing prick with whatever he could get by. But as she sat down again, he leaned forward to kiss her hand, but then got up. She stood as she slipped her coat on. As she stepped out the door, he stopped her. He stepped forward a couple inches and looked her up and down and smiled.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're not a girl, Ms. Henson?" He looked her up and down while smiling.</p> <p>"Well, I haven't been in a class with boys."</p> <p>"Oh. Well, I'm sorry, Thomas. This is no business of yours." She shrugged her shoulders before closing the door. As he stood, she looked around and looked at his coat.</p> <p>"It's a lovely house. This is the first time I've ever been in a class with men. Are you sure you weren'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
