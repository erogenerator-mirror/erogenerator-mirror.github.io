"Yeah... that would really be nice."</p> <p>I reached down, slipped both hands into the front and cupped her breasts in my hands, feeling the softness of her body against mine as I moved her body up and down along with mine. I felt her nipples harden beneath my fingers, and her breathing speeded up. My hand moved down to her lower stomach, slipping over her smooth mound to her soft belly.</p> <p>She reached down to my pants and quickly stripped them off. Her hands slid down my pants as I pushed her down on her back.</p> <p>I slid two fingers inside of her slick slit, feeling the heat, the wetness, the moisture already there. I moved around to the other side and repeated the same motions. She was very wet and, I found, extremely ready. I added a third finger and moved them back to the first, moving them forward in a circular motion as I circled round and round her clit. Her breathing deepened quickly, hips rising against the sensations. Her back arched off the bed, fingers digging into the bed, her eyes closing, then looking up as I inserted a fourth finger into her and moved them back to the first, just to the first knuckle, before slipping in into the wetness, pressing her down against me, feeling all of her against me.</p> <p>The heat built in her body, rising her body to the peak of excitement and the pleasure that a cock did to her with it's fingers. I was amazed at her body, her face, her responses to me, her voice, her expressions of surprise and desire. She cried out every time I pressed down harder on her clitoris, which caused her to arch her head back, eyes squeezed tightly shut and then open again, a half smile on her face. It's so easy to watch my lover. It's so easy to see what she's thinking, what she's feeling.</p> <p>I was surprised at the sight of her in just a t-shirt and panties, but she didn't seem to mind. Her voice, too, quiet yet strong, her eyes were half closed as she reached out to my belt buckle. "Come fuck me," she whispered. "Come on, Baby."</p> <p>I slid my pants and shorts on, reached behind her and unloosened the bra that held her breasts. A slow, deep breath, from her lips, as I did it, made me look down to my two fingers of hand, still moving on her clit, I took one full inch of the shaft into my mouth and slid my lips up and down the shaft. I watched her eyes grow slightly bigger, her mouth open, her breath coming in little pants as her body seemed to respond.</p> <p>One finger slid into her, finding her G spot, feeling how easily I slipped my finger through her wetness. She was so wet around me, as she had been earlier, already dripping as I slipped the third finger into her. The pressure, the feeling, the heat, the sensation, she was incredible. I was surprised at myself, so far out of my own control, so close to climaxing. Her legs tightened, her back arching, her whole body seeming to arch as my lips slid down her breast, to her nipple, and back up again.</p> <p>She was gasping and grinding herself against my hand, her back arching, hands gripping my shoulders, as she made that long drawn out cry and I held on to her, as she came as hard as she'd do in her whole life, and I drank every drop. It was the most beautiful, erotic experience I'd ever had.</p> <p>I slid my pants off, moved her to the bed on her back. The whole body taut, every muscle seeming to tighten and relax as we came down from our high. Her nipples, so long and erect, were begging to be sucked. Her body was taut at the same time. A moment or two later I had her back on the bed, her legs spread wide open, her hands grabbing at the bed covers at her sides. She was looking at me, watching my fingers, one in her mouth, one in her hand, feeling as her body, her hair, her neck, her breasts, her skin, her hair.</p> <p>She was beautiful, so incredibly beautiful, her body so perfect. I was trembling, watching her breasts, her nipples so hard and the little peaks, just barely peeking from between them. She was in my arms, our naked bodies pressing against each other, just wanting something, everything to keep us together. We kissed slowly, softly, our breaths coming faster and faster, our hearts pounding, the bed shakingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
