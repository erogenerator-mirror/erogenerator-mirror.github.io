He turned his head until it rested on the top of her head. Her mouth opened. The sound of his hot breath sent vibrations through her.</p> <p>Mitch took in a deep breath before moving his head up until it met her lips. His eyes flashed at Heather. "Mmm, you're beautiful."</p> <p>A shudder ran through her. She wrapped her arms around him. "Thanks."</p> <p>Mitch grinned. "You're going to need it, too." Mitch opened his eyes and blinked. He was standing at the same spot where Heather had been.</p> <p>He nodded, "I'm already hard." He sat down on the bench and spread his legs.</p> <p>"So, this is it?" She asked as she stood there with her arms crossed against her breasts.</p> <p>"Hell, it's a bit awkward." Mitch laughed.</p> <p>She smiled back. "It's a tight fit, but I'm glad it's in me. I can't hold it any longer."</p> <p>Mitch nodded. "It's a relief, too, even if I do hurt."</p> <p>Heather laughed. "You're hurt? You'll need to hold something until I'm ready for it! I can hold it all day. I can even take it out in the rain."</p> <p>Mitch nodded. "It will be hard the first few seconds, but it'll be worth it. Even if you do, you'll probably only have another twenty minutes of penetration before the pain will all but give way."</p> <p>"I know." Heather leaned back against the bench.</p> <p>Mitch leaned over. He pulled her against his chest and kissed her passionately. He pushed his tongue between her lips and felt her respond eagerly. Mitch rolled his hips against hers. After a moment, he pulled back. "I'm hungry." He picked their clothing bag off the ground.</p> <p>"That's nice of you to give my bags to me," Heather said. "I thought you'd never get here."</p> <p>Mitch laughed. "I can give a few bags to girls, but it's easy. I have to wait outside." He opened the bag and extracted a bag of clothes. "And I have to go inside and take showers with you." He tossed one into the bag. "If you need me to help clean up before I take off, let me know, okay?"</p> <p>"That's nice of you," Heather said. She put her hands on Mitch's chest and pulled him forward until there was only one thing between their lips. "I never get tired of being close to you."</p> <p>Mitch chuckled and they smiled. When he pressed a kiss to Heather's forehead, he reached down and stroked Heather's head. "I'm not sure I can wait until you're all packed."</p> <p>Heather giggled. "Maybe I'll let you fuck me while you're still in my panties."</p> <p>Mitch laughed, and turned his attention back to Heather. "I was hoping somebody would get me all nice and wet for you." He leaned over and cupped her breasts. "There's something I want to do though. Don't you think you should wait a little while to get your clothes and get cleaned up before we leave?"</p> <p>She laughed gently. "Well, it's up to you." She glanced up at the clock. "I should have known you'd be up at this hour, not for a little time."</p> <p>Mitch laughed. "I haven't been this late in my life. What do you say we hurry up and finish and get some things cleaned up?"</p> <p>"Sure, that'd be great."</p> <p><><><><></p> <p>The three waited under the bright, thick blanketed sky for the cab to arrive on the dirt road.</p> <p>Mitch walked Heather through all the questions she had for him. They didn't bother to ask where he worked. They already knew. He knew that, too.</p> <p>'It's no fun with those things up my skirt without trying to rip them off,' he thought. 'Why aren't they even up yet? Maybe he's in the mood to try to make me wet before we even get anywhere.'</p> <p>She smiled happily. 'I had a thought. I think you'd like her, though.'</p> <p>He chuckled. 'You're making things pretty difficult to take off.'</p> <p>'If you'll take off first thing in the morning, then by night's end, I might even enjoy it to the fullest.'</p> <p>'Maybe. But I'll only have to enjoy it after the first time.'</p> <p>He shook his head. 'That's too little.' He looked over his shoulder at the cab on the other side. 'That's probably not such a good start for the roadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
