She grabbed my hand and kissed me one last time.</p> <p>There was just about enough room back in the room so we got moving. She was so lovely, like a goddess in front of me.</p> <p>As we walked out of the kitchen, I looked over and there by the door were our friends. Two of her friends were standing there smiling. I was just going to say hi; when they stopped me.</p> <p>“I think you’ve met the lady that came in and picked up our guest for our evening” they said. They had been talking and looking at me, so I assumed it was my turn.</p> <p>“I think I’ll take her over to her friends and have them take her out to our car.”</p> <p>When they left, they seemed surprised that I had agreed to accompany them. They led me upstairs into their bedroom, took me gently in their arms and gave me the most passionate, most meaningful hug I had ever experienced, and I guess we fell asleep in each other’s arms.</p> <p>When we awoke, all three girls were standing by the bed, naked apart from high heels.</p> <p>“Well, there’s one more thing before we go to dinner,” said Susan.</p> <p>“What is it?” I felt a little apprehensive.</p> <p>“If you want us to stay, you’re going to go down to the bar and pick up a round of drinks, and to your table. I’m going to make sure you are getting plenty of your share of the action in here.”</p> <p>I looked at the two girls. One already had her coat off and had slipped it off. The other appeared to be trying not to be so nervous with a man in uniform but was smiling broadly.</p> <p>“I guess you’ve finished dressing.” said Susan. Then, turning to me "Just watch.” She turned to Amy. "Come in front of you and sit down.”</p> <p>I did as she said and followed Susan, watching as she went to the bar and came back with a drink. I watched with interest as they made their way to the table. I looked closely at all of them, standing a few feet away from Susan, while I was still completely dressed. She noticed my eyes on them too.</p> <p>“What do you think? She looks so hot in those heels!” she said to me.</p> <p>I was standing up straight, now. I had a perfect view of the whole table and I was fascinated by their expressions. Amy was the only one with her face down a little bit. Susan stood behind her and leaned her head forward putting her forehead on the top of Amy’s head. In her low voice they said something together. I could now see Susan’s tongue moving back and forth on Amy’s neck. When they moved to close to the table I saw a look of pure desire in Amy’s eyes and I knew that they were seeing Susan with her tongue in her mouth. Susan’s hands were under Amy’s coat, caressing the thin skin of her body. They seemed to be kissing each other’s arms as they leaned backwards and the hem of Amy’s coat had fallen open. Their legs were apart now. I was looking at an incredibly sexy girl with her long hair cascading down over her shoulders reaching to her waist. There was only their naked legs and the backs of their high heels visible and their tongues in their mouths. This was the most erotic, exciting scene I had ever witnessed.</p> <p>Susan moved to me and I stood up and gave her a kiss before moving to Amy. I had seen her kiss before but I had never felt the intense feeling of Amy’s mouth covering my face. I had felt a woman’s breasts, felt the hard, protruding nipples pressing against my face and felt a woman’s hands running over my body, touching me, tracing me and she kissed me like no other woman had. I felt our tongues dance together and I could taste her saliva as she pressed her body hard against mine. Her hands were on my ass, fingers digging into my cheeks. I felt the weight of her breasts on my chest as she continued to kiss me. I could feel Susan’s hands moving from my shoulders along my belly and they stopped just short of touching my stiff cock, which was sticking out in front of me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
