"There, better!" she managed between gasps of breath. The light was back in, but not yet extinguished.</p> <p>She opened the door and pushed it hard enough for the door to swing shut behind her. She grabbed herself, straightened her clothes, stepped out the door, then started toward the door. As she turned back to face the light she thought to herself, "I had not thought I could really do without this feeling. Maybe I could be free if I just kept this feeling here," she decided, then smiled to herself.</p> <p>"I'm glad it is late."</p> <p>The first thing that she saw was my reflection in the little mirror, framed by the light.</p> <p>She could almost read her mind; "You look beautiful, but not pretty. You want to wear something else!" The grin on her face quickly faded, she remembered her past and knew that she wasn't sure what to call this out again.</p> <p>"I'm not wearing anything," the woman corrected her. She walked over to the counter to put on some clothes to take out. "If I go running it will be a good time to get some stuff out of the place," she said as she stood behind the counter. She was still in her underwear but it was clear to see that it wasn't tight. She made a move for the door, when it was in position to close.</p> <p>Before she even got to the door it closed, locking behind her again. "This should work," she thought. "Maybe there won't be anything wrong and I can see my reflection in the mirror. There will be something for me to work at." She turned back toward the door where her clothes hung on the hook. "I can't go running naked until I'm dressed. I need to feel like I'm being taken by a predator right then."</p> <p>She looked down at the counter. She didn't see anything.</p> <p>Before she could think she was stepping into the elevator. A feeling of relief flooded over her, while she thought, "I really am free! If I can trust this woman to keep this feeling, I'll do anything she tells me to!"</p> <p>The elevator door pulled open, they could just go in, as she didn't think of it that way; she didn't even feel like being naked.</p> <p>She just stood there.</p> <p>"Well, I'm almost glad that she didn't lock up the lobby before she went out there.</p> <p>She couldn't really put down to being alone, it was too late, now they were both being naked.</p> <p>"If you don't mind me, I'd like to take off my shoes," she thought. "I could be running again."</p> <p>While she was walking down the hallway to her door, her heart was pounding. She felt like she was being chased by a bear.</p> <p>Her heart kept pounding, then she heard it.</p> <p>"There I go I'll give you a kiss in that ear. And when you hear it again just whisper it 'no'."</p> <p>The realization that it might be the latter hit her the hardest.</p> <p>Her pulse was beating, she felt as if it were on it and she had nothing as it raced up through her body to her brain.</p> <p>In her mind it was 'I can't stop now, ' She was almost certain that the woman was talking to her, but there was silence even as the breath caught in her throat. Her mind raced, she didn't think that she could resist this woman, so she stepped back into her building, almost making it stop before her door.</p> <p>As she opened the door, she had to breathe deeply to get herself to calm down or panic when she saw the woman.</p> <p>The door was right beside hers, she could get in her apartment without going out any further. Her heart stopped, as she stared at the woman's eyes. The woman was beautiful, but this was even more stunning when she knew what she was looking for.</p> <p>She almost said something; or walked out, but something stopped her; something drew her to her and the words just didn't register.</p> <p>The woman looked at her and smiled, her eyes still held hers in their spell.</p> <p>"You're beautiful, beautiful!"</p> <p>This time she did move in, this time the voice sounded more like a statement, she just wanted her words to sound like they used to be.</p> <p>To describe the woman, she is beautiful; as beautiful as any woman he had ever met before; as lovely.</p> <p>"No, yes, yes, yes I can't," she said as she tried hard to remember herself again. "I'm just too afraid!"</p> <p>They made that soundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
