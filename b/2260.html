If it means she'll have a place in the world now that she's moved in with me, then it's a good thing."</p> <p>Now I felt my face heat and my blood pressure rising; I couldn't wait to see her in that position with me as my own personal slave.</p> <p>"Oh, I hope you like it; there's my new owner here as my personal slave right now."</p> <p>I looked at her with growing apprehension. Surely she'd never make it this far before me. If she doesn't want to submit, please don't stop me, I thought as I approached and knelt a little closer to her.</p> <p>"Please, my new owner," I whispered, "Please don't stop me."</p> <p>I placed a hand on her right knee and gently moved it up towards to her upper thigh, where I felt her breath catch again as my hand softly caressed her skin just under the hem of her skirt. I let my hand move ever nearer to the center of her legs and felt that she was wearing no panties at all as my fingers gently touched her. And her legs didn't move apart in response to my touch.</p> <p>"Please don't stop me," she whispered. "Please don't stop; I just had to have this."</p> <p>"Your owner isn't here to stop you; and I will not let you forget it or forget how good it feels," I assured her as I kept my hand in place.</p> <p>I put one foot up onto the bed, her legs parted just enough, so that I could kiss her inner thigh and move my tongue between her legs. She lifted her hips up, pressing against my mouth, causing me to part her legs and feel the wetness of her as I licked my way up her left leg, moving over her inner thigh and slowly moving towards her pussy. She didn't let go of my hand and spread her legs wider to give me an even better view. I could see that she was trembling with desire which she'd rarely shown on her own or at least in the past, but had never displayed when her body was excited. I could tell she was nervous; if I really wanted to do this, then I would have to take it slow. And if not, I could stop right now before she climaxed at my hands, after all she had promised to me that time last night, and I would have to give it to her this morning. I decided to play the role of master until the moment she came into my presence, so that the best results would be had by the time our relationship was through, and the best part would be when she surrendered to me.</p> <p>I kissed her tenderly on the lips, savoring the scent of her, savoring the taste of her, and feeling her tongue slip inside my mouth as my lips met and caressed hers. She let go of one of my hands and rested her hand on my stomach, feeling what was about to happen.</p> <p>I brought my tongue down to her lower lips, then pulled her right leg forward and onto my chest, pulling her body closer so that I could push my nose into the top of her sex. Her legs spread as far apart as they would go, and I had an idea, so I quickly flicked my tongue over her clit, causing her to moan with pleasure. I pushed two of my fingers into her, pressing them firmly against her g-spot as I sucked on her lips, then slid them out and inside, searching for the tightest opening of her sex. I felt the moisture already beginning to show on one side of her lips, and I wanted to taste the sweetness inside.</p> <p>I moved my tongue up and into her waiting pussy so that I could taste more of her. I couldn't wait for her first time tasting a woman and could only imagine that it wouldn't be like this. I wanted to taste every inch of her woman. I couldn't resist the pleasure of her juices coating my tongue until they ran down my throat. Finally, I moved my tongue towards her little nubbin, and could taste the warmth of her, smell her hairless skin on it, listen to her soft moans and feel the tingle of her muscles contracting on my tongue and face.</p> <p>It's not that I'm a selfish lover; or that I'm a man that's never satisfied with a woman before, but a man that's always on the lookout for his next opportunity to have her. I want to make her mine now. The only one that I won't be depriving is me.</p> <p>I took my hand away from her hips and pushed three fingers into her easily. She was very tight, very small. I could feel no pressure or resistanceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
