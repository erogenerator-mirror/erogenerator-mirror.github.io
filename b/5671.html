There was a silence which eventually became awkward. "Did you use the other bathroom?" he asked softly. "Or did it have someone sitting behind it?"</p> <p>"Yes, I was in a stall," I confessed, "as you may have guessed."</p> <p>"And?" he added. "Did you have anyone else in there too?"</p> <p>I couldn't believe I had just admitted that I wasn't a married woman that was doing this to me, but I couldn't stop looking at my reflection. I'm sure he saw the color of my hair, the way every inch of me felt in his hands - how it clung to one of my every move - but it was me, not some innocent guy who was running around with his dick in his hand. "No, I left the other stalls with someone," I said, "and I'm just finishing getting dressed now."</p> <p>"You're so full of shit," he replied, "you can't leave now!"</p> <p>"I'm fine," I said, "just finished getting the house cleaned up."</p> <p>"Oh, OK," he said and stepped out of the hallway.</p> <p>I finished getting dressed myself and then wandered back to my room to put on my heels. "That was a weird night, I guess," I muttered to myself.</p> <p>"I bet you didn't realize it was a man, did you?" I heard the voice say as I slipped my feet into my sandals.</p> <p>For once my thoughts were definitely on my feet. I don't know why he would want to fuck around with me, but he did. He had his hands full and he wasn't paying attention to me at all. I wondered what I should or shouldn't do, and then I decided to just go over and just stand there and smile at him as he walked away from me. If we stood there forever then it was just about time he did anything.</p> <p>The next morning I just stood to my own devices; I was getting dressed for work at the moment and couldn't imagine what he wanted if we sat in the living room talking and watching television.</p> <p>After an eternity he spoke again. "I saw somebody and someone else, last night," he said, "but I got to wondering. Did you know the other girls were fucking each other just now?"</p> <p>"Who?" I asked. I wasn't really asking him. I was wondering what it would be like to watch people, just like he was watching me. I liked that the idea of it made me want him more, so I guess at some point there was a bit of confusion and I found myself wishing he could see me as I was trying to get ready the following morning.</p> <p>"Who?" he finally asked but when I started to open my mouth he went on. "I saw the other guys, you know." He paused for a moment, and then he asked "Do you have a girlfriend?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I sighed, "with a younger guy here from work."</p> <p>"I wish," he muttered. Then he looked at me strangely.</p> <p>"Where's the other girl?" he asked, "how did you meet her?"</p> <p>"I went by the other room and found this other girl here in back," I pointed to the other room I could see through the glass. "I went over there after the party, I noticed they were all together."</p> <p>"So," he added, "you're the woman I saw before in your backseat."</p> <p>I wasn't expecting this. He was looking right at me, so I guess he was guessing. I knew he was looking at my cleavage - there was no mistaking what he was doing - because right then I was leaning a bit forward and pushing it forward as far as it could go into the gap between my breasts. It was an erotic sight to hear him ogle me like that, but I didn't mind.</p> <p>"So," he repeated, "did you find someone?"</p> <p>"No," I sighed, "I guess my memory wasn't quite up to it. I saw their bedroom."</p> <p>"What are you talking about?" he asked, "this was a one way street."</p> <p>That made him chuckle. "You know what they say is 'just like old times' - 'There is no better moment than one date with a woman'."</p> <p>"So what happened in that house?" I asked, trying to see where he was going with this. We hadn't been exactly casual about anything, but, for me, it was obvious we hadn't been exclusive at all.</p> <p>"Well," he began, "that's when I had to go back to work."</p> <p>"But you'll be able to come back here next Tuesdayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
