Her dress slipped up and she lowered her body onto his. She took his hand and held them over her face, as she kissed him on the cheek.</p> <p>"I have to go,"she said, and began to push the dress up.</p> <p>"No you don't," he said. "I don't want you to. I want to kiss you forever."</p> <p>She smiled and sat on him facing him. He ran her hand through her long, dark hair, making her head shake, making her lips quiver. They kissed, and she slid one hand up his chest, over his chin and down his neck. His fingers were tangled in her hair, and he ran them through the length of it. She loved it. He kissed her forehead and then her eyelids, then her ear lobe, making her moan. He kissed it and then her chest. She sighed and kissed him, and they kissed long, slow, soft. He felt her bra strap slip off her shoulder and felt her large breast, soft and plump against him. She kissed him on the lips and said, "I won't let you go, I promise."</p> <p>They were in his bed, naked, and she rolled him on to his back. "How long had it been after this?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Almost a week," he replied.</p> <p>"I'm so happy that I've come," She said as she kissed his shoulder, then his chest, and slowly traced a path to his mouth. He kissed her soft lips and took her nipples between his fingers, and she gasped and moaned. He kissed her neck and then down her collarbone to her left breast. He cupped it, and she giggled. "God this feels great, you got me excited and excited," she said.</p> <p>"It gets that way," he replied without removing his mouth from her.</p> <p>"What is it that excites you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm," he hummed as he sucked her nipple in and released it. He licked it, then went back to her nipple, nibbling the whole thing. He cupped her other breast and kissed each nipple, then sucked the entire thing in his mouth, deep again. She sighed and her hands flew up to his head, holding it against her. She loved his face, she loved the idea of his mouth on her skin.</p> <p>"Oh yes, that feels so good. You are a beautiful creature, you're a goddess, and I love you." She felt more than heard it, and her hips began to hump against his lap. "Mmm, so big," she moaned, pressing in so his rigid shaft would drive up into her, and she needed to cum, she needed to feel him, and she needed love, and she didn't care about everything anymore.</p> <p>That was when she had another thought on her face. "Why don't we try to have sex, if we can work something out."</p> <p>He grinned and pulled her up to him. "What?"</p> <p>"I wanted to ask you if we could."</p> <p>"Can we try?"</p> <p>He kissed her, and slid down her body until his mouth was just over her sex. His tongue flickered across her. She groaned and pushed into his face. "Eat my pussy!" she moaned. Her fingers entwined in his hair. "Oh god, I'm cumming!" she cried, as she felt the release, not knowing if she would ever be this vocal with anyone. He sucked the swollen lips into his mouth and caressed the area around the hole with his tongue. He could taste her sweet cum, and feel her body spasm and gush in his mouth. He kept his mouth on her clit, and worked over it like he had seen her do. He had licked and sucked it like a baby's pacifier while she was cumming, and it did not taste half bad. It actually tasted like a banana, and it felt like he had gone so far into her that he had to have it every so often, even after she had stopped trembling or screaming and had her first climax. Her legs trembled as his mouth found her pussy and began to caress.</p> <p>"Oh god, eat me, do it. Eat me. Eat me!" she cried, and felt her orgasm wash over her as his tongue caressed her clit and slipped between the swollen lips. Her hips jerked as his lips moved to cover it, and she felt herself go into another climax. He sucked her clit, and flicked the tip with his tongue. Her hands held his head, not wanting it to stop. She was delirious again, but she loved it.
