"You need my help!"</p> <p>"No," I said. I felt her hand come up and run over the back of my neck. "I'm tired."</p> <p>"You sure?"</p> <p>I nodded and looked around to see if she was aware of what was happening to me.</p> <p>"This is no way to go back," I said. "This is all my fault!"</p> <p>"No it's not. The last thing I want is to give you a reason to leave."</p> <p>"I'm not leaving you!"</p> <p>"Of course not!" she exclaimed and grabbed some tissues to clean the blood and dirt that had run down my neck. "This is only the beginning. I want us all to be like this every time."</p> <p>"I'm scared," I said. "I can only hope we'll stay like this all the time; if we can't, I guess I'd better say something to my mom."</p> <p>"OK," she said. "But before we go, are you sure this will work out?"</p> <p>"If it does, it will probably be a lot easier. I can't be so forward when I've been with someone else."</p> <p>"Thank you. We'll make our best effort."</p> <p>"You know, I've always wondered if we could do a one-time thing."</p> <p>"Sure you can. If you want to."</p> <p>"How much am I going to have to do to get myself in the mood to have sex with you?"</p> <p>"I don't really care," she said. "How 'bout it, you."</p> <p>"OK!" I said while taking some tissues to clean the wound and blood off and putting the tissues in the machine. The machine began to buzz and I could see that my body was responding to the stimulus and it helped me relax a lot while I took my time getting dressed. I'm sure the first thing I'd say to her was, "I'm sorry baby, I've got a hangover or something." I'm not sure if I really said it at all.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," she said. "I'm sorry," she said. "My husband is out for the day."</p> <p>I don't know if she believed that but I still didn't understand why she'd be so mad at me. The pain in our relationship had been there for a long time, long enough to make me think about that relationship but at that point I decided that I was just going back to bed.</p> <p>"How about we stay up all night and you show me around your house?" I asked. "I want to be more comfortable while we're there."</p> <p>"If that's what you want," she replied as she slipped her jacket on over her blouse, "I'll stay here."</p> <p>"I have a room upstairs. I thought maybe you could share your room."</p> <p>"OK if I can," she said. "I won't want me to change and change while we're up there."</p> <p>"OK," I said. "My room's pretty small. I'll leave you alone while I get the room and we'll stop by." Even as we said each other my heart was beating a million beats a second. I felt like a fool for letting these thoughts fly about with these feelings so high. Why am I doing this? I want to be more like this. More passionate.</p> <p>When we'd got all the stuff to my room and closed the door, we left it open just a crack so people would know we were going inside. I sat down on the edge of my bed.</p> <p>"You can keep yourself warm," I said.</p> <p>"No. Not here. Come on."</p> <p>The room had that "be careful what you wish for" feeling. We had the same idea. I was going to get into the mood. I took a drink of water and opened my eyes and looked down at myself. I put my water down and lay back on the bed. I closed my eyes and felt the heat of the room coming off me. I started getting to feel a bit like a teenager. Like I'm in my twenties with the world aflame out there. At times I really like the feeling I have when it comes to this. I feel like a teenager again. I'm feeling like a grown man. I can feel that all the way down to my toes. My whole body feels like it'll never end.</p> <p>I started feeling myself up and then I saw the first signs of my body responding. I felt my nipples begin to stiffen. I felt my nipples become hard. They were the most sensitive part of my tits. There is no way I could have resistedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
