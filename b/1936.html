It began a slow simmering heat between our naked bodies. She had a very warm glow on her face and she was flushed as she had sex with me earlier. I knew I would cum soon that night and I had no doubt in her mind that it would be with or without my cock.</p> <p>"Do you know what you're doing now? I haven’t even touched you there yet."</p> <p>"Yes, I had not been getting enough attention, not just about what I'm getting from my friend in that department. Do you even know how badly I want you to be my lover? Do you have ever really kissed a boy? It is so exciting. I can’t hold back much longer." She had already taken one of these deep breaths and she was almost back at the same level of excitement that she had been when I first started rubbing her feet. "Just lick me there, slowly and play with me. I want you to kiss me where I am most intimate to you. I want you to kiss me and make me cum."</p> <p>My mouth was now so dry with my desire and I just licked my own finger again and then rubbed the tip between her legs. My cock was rock hard, the precum I had already created was pouring out of me and she was pushing her finger into me as I was trying to lick her.</p> <p>"Put it in there, make me cum, please. Make me cum in you. I want to cum inside you."</p> <p>I knew instinctively that I would have to do anything I had to do. It was a strange request from her. She was in her own world and she was mine and I was hers. In the end I was very, very happy to do her bidding. I knew now that I would never take my life back. I had learned so much already, I had learned so much about the world and I wanted to learn and understand the things I had learned. I knew I would never go without the experience of my lifetime, I wanted to let it go for only a little while and then find a new place.</p> <p>"Don't be such a stranger. Just do it."</p> <p>As she spoke the command she was so easily able to hear from me and I felt as if I would explode with joy. My cock was now at full attention again as it stood erect as I continued to lick her feet as she stroked my hair. She leaned forward and we kissed again, my lips parted and our tongues touched. It was a long sensuous and erotic kissing, and a little longer than I had gotten from my previous relationship with the other girls, but it seemed to have gone on forever without a break.</p> <p>We paused and she said, "Please do that again. Rub your cock back in me."</p> <p>I was in paradise. I would do anything for her, anything at all to bring her to climax. It was a moment that I will remember and never forget. There were so many wonderful things I had come to take her mind off of my own and it had only been a dream. If this evening was even possible. My mind had never been so open and so full of meaning as the time she and me were creating, and I knew that I wasn't out there, any more than I ever had been. It was wonderful.</p> <p>My cock had been soft at first and it didn’t last long. I had to do it again and she saw how good it was. She reached for me and my cock went hard within her. That had been so good. She had given me her love and I wanted her to give herself to me for her own sake as much as for the other women.</p> <p>She moved over on the edge of the bed as she lay down, still stroking my cheek.</p> <p>"Do me now, I want to see your face. I want to see everything."</p> <p>My body was still throbbing and the desire was so great in me that I had to have her again and I looked into her eyes as I slid my hardness into her vagina again. She was warm and wet and as I began to push it in and out I felt her vagina expand and I saw as she moaned. I looked in her eyes, saw those eyes and I saw something that would never be lost, she saw the love I had for her as something that was lost in that moment. I knew that I would be never the same if this were the only time we took the time to enjoy each other. I thought she was the same way and knew that she would never be the same. It was wonderful to feel her as we made love that night and that night we both came. This was something I wanted to do that the same way and yet I wanted the same thing.</p> <p>It was an—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
