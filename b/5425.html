She stood up and said, "I have to tell someone."</p> <p>With that, she wrapped herself in a bathrobe and hurried off to her bedroom. I stared after her for a few moments, enjoying the show that was about to take place; her legs were exposed, and I was sure that I could see her shaved pussy. She walked back past me and I hurried back to my room.</p> <p>I got naked and got into bed. This wasn't like the others, but it worked. I was surprised at how sexy it felt to have my naked, naked girlfriend lying next to me, her breasts pressed against my leg. I was turned on, I was hard, and I know that if I had an erection right then, it would be at least a foot long.</p> <p>As I lay next to her, I could feel her body warm up, and I reached over to caress her. As I felt the skin of her left breast I gently caressed her other breast with my other hand, and continued to massage the right breast. I found her nipple erect and I gave it gentle tweaks, causing her to moan. We lay there for just a few minutes longer and then she whispered, "Can I get you something to drink?"</p> <p>I was glad that we had sex one more time before I got up, as I was sure that I would be sleeping a lot tonight. I got into my pajama bottoms and went into my night stand to pull out a bottle of vodka. As I put the first drink in her glass, she looked at me with a smile. "I'll go and get cleaned up and dressed." She headed off to the bathroom, and about the same time, I heard the water start running in the shower. I turned to see her naked walking down my hall and heading to her room, and she returned a few moments later with one of hers.</p> <p>She leaned down to kiss me. "Can I get you some clothes? That robe's a little warm."</p> <p>I gave her a hug, and then she turned the light off and got into bed. I put my pajamas on while she put on her teddy and top, and we quickly fell into each other's arms. "It's warm in my room," she said, "and I'm glad that we slept together." She snuggled into my body, and then she cuddled me closer to her. "I couldn't leave you like this," she said. "It's lonely here without you."</p> <p>I just held her close to me and enjoyed the warmth of her body next to mine. Her arms wrapped around me, and I felt her soft breasts pressed against me. "You're my hero, lover," she said. "I love it when I'm your hero." I wasn't sure what to say, but I said, "I love it when you're my hero too."</p> <p>I kissed her forehead just under the right eye for a minute, and then looked out the window. The sun was starting to set, but it was getting dark. As we kissed I began to wonder about what we would do for the rest of the night. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and awoke only a few moments later. "I feel like a little kid," she said with a laugh. "I think that I'm going into orbit." We both shared a smile, and then we just lay there for a minute looking at each other. "Do you think we might be able to get out of here tomorrow?" I asked.</p> <p>She looked at me, but didn't answer. We just cuddled for a few moments longer, and then she rose up on her knees to kiss me. "What do you think?" she whispered.</p> <p>"I don't know right now, but I do know that I want to feel the warmth of your body next to me."</p> <p>"I don't know either. This feels really good," she said and took my hand in hers. "I think that, if we could just get out of here tomorrow night, we could start to get away from the whole mess out there...</p> <p>We talked a little bit about what was about to happen and how it was going to come to pass. But before she could do that, we drifted off to sleep againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
