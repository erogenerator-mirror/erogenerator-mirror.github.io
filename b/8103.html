I'd love to see that body of yours again.' The expression on her face made me think.</p> <p>'Not on my account, I was just surprised, but I wouldn't change a thing.'</p> <p>I was relieved. I was so happy, I was almost jealous.</p> <p>'Look, I'm really sorry, I really think this is a mistake.'</p> <p>'Not at all,' she said, 'I would like to try my hand at a lot more, and then, we can talk about this later.'</p> <p>'Yes, sure, I'd love to see you in action. And you are so beautiful, I could do with a little bit more.'</p> <p>Our discussion was very pleasant, with lots of laughter, and as much of the evening as the night had passed. I kissed her very lightly on the lips, and took one of her hands in mine and placed it on my breast. My nipple was already erect.</p> <p>'Oh. That feels nice. You need a little more of my experience of being in an audience?'</p> <p>'That would be nice. Anything but the dance, I'm not ready for that feeling of being under someone's body.'</p> <p>'Don't you feel a little tense?'</p> <p>I could tell. 'I can't explain why, I feel like this is a big mistake. I've never felt so strongly for a woman before. Do you mind if I keep touching your breasts?'</p> <p>She didn't answer. I didn't want to scare her away, so I slowly reached down and cupped each of her nipples, gently making them hard. Then I gave her nipple a little tweak; she shivered.</p> <p>'It's ok, I like the feeling, not so hard.'</p> <p>'So do your breasts. I'll bet you don't feel as tense.'</p> <p>'I feel a little uncomfortable, if I move too far, I'll lose control.'</p> <p>'Don't worry, it's an enjoyable experience.'</p> <p>'Now I want you to give me one of your favourite fantasies.'</p> <p>She had a strange look on her faces. 'What do you have in mind, then?'</p> <p>'Well you can either just come and sit on my lap, or you can sit on mine again.'</p> <p>'Can I take my panties off again?'</p> <p>'Please, not just sit on my lap. Take yours off too.'</p> <p>She was a little embarrassed. 'I don't want to seem like such a whore.'</p> <p>'I don't think you're a whore. In fact, I think you really do look quite lovely.' I gave her another squeeze and let go.</p> <p>'Thank you, that felt so nice. It's just that I have never done anything like this before. Thank you so much.'</p> <p>'There's just one condition.'</p> <p>'What's that?'</p> <p>'You can give me a little more pleasure of this.'</p> <p>'What's that?'</p> <p>'I can show you something I have been dreaming of.'</p> <p>'How can you show me the difference?'</p> <p>'I'll take the top off, you can take the bottom.'</p> <p>'If you take off my panties you can sit on them too.'</p> <p>I wasn't sure why she wanted to keep quiet. It was a big favour she was trying to avoid.</p> <p>'No, I wouldn't put my panties on if I didn't think you wanted me to.' She was a little frightened.</p> <p>'The point is, I just want to be with you.'</p> <p>'Do you want to come and sit on my lap again?'</p> <p>'Yes, would you like that? That is really different, I want so much to show you what I feel.'</p> <p>'I don't want to ask you if it's ok but do you still want me to do that to you too?'</p> <p>'Of course I do. Please, I would like to do it again with you.'</p> <p>I wasn't sure exactly where the line was. I could show her, but I knew my husband would not allow it. I might regret it later.</p> <p>'Come on then, let me take my panties off. I don't want them to be stained with my juices.'</p> <p>She didn't argue. She had to agree to my terms. She was very shy.</p> <p>'Are you sure you want to do this?' I couldn't say much.</p> <p>'Yes, I'll accept that.'</p> <p>'Do you want to try?'</p> <p>She hesitated for a moment, then nodded her agreement.</p> <p>'I'll be right back.'</p> <p>I followed her to the kitchen.
