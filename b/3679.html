That can't be," I replied as my hands caressed her skin.</p> <p>"Oh, god, just keep doing that. If you touch me right now I won't last long."</p> <p>I lowered my face in between her legs, moving the head of my penis to her vagina and letting out a moan of pleasure as she did the same. She let her hand slip down her stomach and started stroking me, not letting me do much, just letting me do everything at once. I could feel her lips on the bottom of my penis and it felt as though it were going in a vice.</p> <p>"Let me have it," she said, pulling me toward her. When I couldn't hold back any longer I just shoved in and felt her whole body squirm under me.</p> <p>"Oh fuck. You're too big," she said in a soft voice as I started thrusting in and out. She wrapped her legs over mine, pulling me even harder into her. She was tight, feeling very much the same way about as much as when I had sex with her before. I loved it. It wasn't any better then I had remembered, but I was determined that we would make the perfect couple in time. It was just so good being with my mom. It felt as if an electric current was running through my body, from my crotch to every extremity. Then, like with the music, I felt the tingle in my penis intensify and it grew even bigger.</p> <p>"Mom! You're so big!" I could barely speak.</p> <p>I wanted to go faster, but couldn't get the words out as I felt her hands run through my hair as I thrust in and out of her. I tried to speak, but found myself unable to even think. My body was on autopilot and I just hung on to her, reveling in her body and enjoying every second of it. I didn't want this to end, I didn't want this beautiful woman, even though she was asking me to start making love to her and taking her pleasure in return. Her words were like a drug, a narcotic, bringing me off and causing me to lose it quicker than I thought I could possibly want to. I thrust in harder and felt a familiar sensation building in my abdomen.</p> <p>"Oh, honey," she said, wrapping her arms around my neck and pulling my face into her. "I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>I leaned over her body, supporting myself on my hands as I felt her orgasm begin. A light squirt gushed out of her and landed on my penis and she groaned and quivered as she tried to swallow it, but continued to try and lick it from my lap. Finally she started to relax her body and she began to kiss me, pressing her lips back against my lips with a passionate energy.</p> <p>"Oh, sweetheart, I've never felt anything like that."</p> <p>"Did you just cum?" I asked in return. Her back arched and she let out another sound of pleasure.</p> <p>"Uh-huh," I said with a laugh. "And you've been so good," I continued as I grabbed onto her hips and continued to thrust into her.</p> <p>"I'm just glad that mom made that video last night."</p> <p>"Mom, honey..." I gasped. "You did?"</p> <p>"I did. I've been dreaming of having sex with a guy. You know the one."</p> <p>"I was dreaming," I said in surprise.</p> <p>"I thought I was going to die," she said in a dreamless voice.</p> <p>"That would be okay, I suppose. I have never felt anything like it, ever in my life," I assured her in a very heartfelt tone.</p> <p>"You don't have to feel good just to be with a girl like me, or anyone like me," she said in a low voice, letting me know that. I felt a little self-conscious on my back, sitting up like a child.</p> <p>"Don't you dare try to hide your feelings. It's just going to happen." I was trying to convince her that I was doing all right and that I still loved her as much as I have for all of these years.</p> <p>"Honey, we're a couple of people, we have to respect that. It's just the two of us. We won't hurt each other. Okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," I said as I pushed her off my lap and onto her back, looking into her eyes. I leaned into her and kissed her on her cheek, then down to her neck where I gently bit her, drawing a slight moan as she jumped in surprise. I continued to kiss my way down her body until I reached the bottom, where I took her left nipple between my lips, sucking on it just a little. Then I kissed up her neckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
