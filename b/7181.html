I reach down and grab you by the tie in my hand and pull you in for a kiss that has all the promise in the world. Our tongues dance wildly as I run my hands along your body, from your tight muscles in your body, from your long legs to your long, full breasts.</p> <p>My hands move down to your bottom, where I push you in toward the shower so you'll have to step over. You bend over, and I push you in and bend you over to lock the door. You reach up and grab my hair just above the small of my back and start kissing and tonguing me. Our bodies rub and grind against each other, and I'm becoming very excited with your hard nipples against me, against my hard cock underneath my pants. You can tell just from what I just did when I felt your body and it drives me mad. You can't help but moan a little bit louder. I push my shorts and underwear down enough to release my cock from it's restraint.</p> <p>I step out of my shorts and kneel down by your leg so you can reach down and take your cock in hand. I begin to stroke and slowly stroke you hard cock. You can feel it getting harder with each stroke that I make, it's throbbing against you, as your cock grows with each stroke. Soon your cock is fully erect, now harder as I run my hand along the head; your precum was glistening on our skin in the shower.</p> <p>I place my mouth over a nipple and start sucking and teasing it with my tongue. I suck on it hard enough to make you moan and move your hips against my body. You feel my hard cock on your body and your eyes are closed so your face doesn't look so good with your cock in my mouth.</p> <p>"I need to fuck you," I say with a voice you didn't recognize. I look up at you and wink at you. I walk over to my bag and look down at myself. I'm about to put my cock right into your face. But instead, I put it back where it was in your dream.</p> <p>"What's that there," I ask with a smirk. "I thought you liked to have it all," I call out. "Don't mind if I fuck your mouth, too" I say. I walk over to your hand so I'm standing in front of you in front of the mirror. You put your arm through mine, holding it back so I can see you better.</p> <p>"I do, I really do," you say into my ear. I stroke you and you put your hand on my thigh. You can barely touch.</p> <p>"Do you really think I liked that when you were dreaming?" I ask. I let your arm come to rest and let you take over the action as I begin the same movements you have just done to your body. Up and down just the one line of my penis so it touches your cheek when I go down to your lips. Up on my knees so I can put my hand on your hip. I can feel your body move slightly with mine. My hands on your neck and neck as I'm moving up and down. My thumb lightly rub your neck, as I start to thrust to your lips. I can feel how it's starting to move and I love to feel how wet your lips are. I have my hand between my legs and it is on the base of my shaft and getting very slick. You want more so you can feel better.</p> <p>You look up at me, your eyes are moist, your mouth is open, but I think yours is smiling up at me. I let your hand rest on my leg where your hand is now holding something I have in front of us. I lean down so you can feel what I have here. I put my tongue on your nipple very slowly, then use my mouth to gently and slowly roll it in circles. I lick up and down your breasts and I kiss and lick your nipples. Your skin tingles under the attention, so wonderful.</p> <p>I reach my hand under the shirt of your top and put my fingers on the bottom of your breast. I play and tease them for a bit, then I lift the shirt up so you can feel my hand on your whole body. I can feel you getting hotter, your nipples are harder. Your chest is slightly heaving now, you are breathing hard and holding your breath. Your body is pulsing below my touch and I run my fingers down your stomach, over your belly button in my hand and I circle around your navel, just a bit.</p> <p>I move my mouth to your neck and kiss you very softly as I kiss you over and over. You feel your body getting tense by now and you want me to touch you, move over you more. Your body starts to move against my hand, movingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
