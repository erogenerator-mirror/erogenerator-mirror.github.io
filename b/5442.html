The soft touch of her fingers was like electricity flooding through my body, my blood-engorged cock throbbing against her leg.</p> <p>"Me too," I said softly as my knees became weak and I had to steady myself on the seat. "That's the best thing. It means so much to us."</p> <p>"Thank you so much - I am so lucky to have you," she whispered.</p> <p>"Let me have the next drink," I said, trying to sound gentle, but my voice was hoarse. I could hear the way she nodded and the sound of her fingers on the glass, then the look of contentment I had only ever seen on her face. As I watched my friend slowly pour my whisky, I felt my heart skip a beat, for although my friend was lovely - beautiful like a princess - and sexy like a model in heat, there was just something missing between us in that moment, my friend and I.</p> <p>"I want to talk with you about how much we love each other," she said, her voice barely loud enough for me to hear, and I took a long draught of the wine. I was unsure if the way she was talking about us being close friends, but all my questions were cut off as my friend's soft lips encircled my lips and her soft fingers stroked my hair.</p> <p>"I don't know about your kind of love," I explained as I brought her hand up to my nose, inhaling her scent and then taking her soft finger into my mouth. Her soft moans of pleasure pushed me over the top and I started to pant, hardening in my jeans as I imagined our lips locked together and our bodies moving against each other. "I know I'm pretty, but your lips turn me on so," I added, kissing her softly. "It makes me hard to think about you without clothes on."</p> <p>"I was just telling how you wanted me to feel when we were kissing," she said, a blush filling her cheeks.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful, Anna," I said, then kissed her again, making her arch her body against me, pressing up against me.</p> <p>"I want to kiss you so much. I want to be with you - to be with you," her fingers ran on my forearm as I moved the silk of her dress to the side, exposing the smooth, tanned skin of her thigh.</p> <p>"I know," I said shyly, "but even better is seeing you with me."</p> <p>"I want to see how good you are at this."</p> <p>"I promise," I said, kissing her again as we continued to kiss with desire. We shared another kiss, one of lust and tenderness, I don't think she realized how much she had started to melt in my mouth or how much she felt, but she didn't care. I took her hand and we continued to kiss as we both continued to press our bodies together, our hearts beating as the passion grew.</p> <p>I felt her thigh trembling as mine pushed mine into her crotch, it felt as if she had slipped into me, her soft flesh touching mine as her fingers curled around my waist and I felt her breast pressing into me. We broke apart momentarily, our faces looking into each other's eyes as we returned to our kiss once more.</p> <p>"You know, I feel like I should just go, but I love you. I'm not a complete stranger to you," she said, as her fingers stroked my erection through my pants.</p> <p>"Really?" I asked, my breath hot against her lips. "You've got me right where you want me."</p> <p>"I want everything and everyone," she whispered in my ear, a look of pure heat in it, "that you can do for me."</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"I mean, I want us to be lovers. And we should have a lot more than that."</p> <p>"It's not like we're not going to..." I started to finish, but she slid her free hand down from my breast and started to unbutton my shirt.</p> <p>"I know, but this is just so right, and we can be together."</p> <p>A look of pleasure split her face, "and what else if I don't like you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, you're not a one man woman, are you," she chuckled. "So, tell me everything," I said, a bit of a surprise, to my surprise.</p> <p>"Anna, I'm really hot and bothered right now," she said, her eyes darting down to my cock, "so how about we go inside before you fall outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
