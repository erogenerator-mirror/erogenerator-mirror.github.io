The truth was what he wanted. To feel his cock slide into her. To be the man who wanted to fuck her...and fuck her until he couldn't fucking stop himself. He wanted to fuck her until they were both exhausted. And then he did everything he could to try and be the man she wanted him to be. And that turned into a long, hot shower that left both of them trembling and hot...</p> <p>********</p> <p>The next day, he got up and grabbed a couple sheets and blankets. He grabbed and blanket and blankets; tossed them into the dirty laundry hamper and went back to work, hoping to surprise her with his surprise when she got home. He wasn't disappointed as he found her still asleep. They were spooning, slowly moving, as he felt her breathing begin to calm. He gently lifted his arm and saw it was covered in a thick blanket. He didn't want to wake her. After all, she was asleep. He got up, took off his covers and headed for the kitchen. She was already there, spooned up against him, her arm tucked over him, her thigh against his...</p> <p>'Mmm...you smell good.' He reached up and softly kissed her cheek.</p> <p>'Did I wake you?'</p> <p>'Mmm yes, I was just thinking that you tasted good.' She leaned back against him, her face pressed against his chest.</p> <p>He kissed her lightly on her nose, then her lips, then her chin, and each time he kissed her it became firmer and more passionate. He could feel every pore in her body. Her breasts, still firm and round, were pressed against him now, and he could feel her nipples start to harden in the light. He had to have her now.</p> <p>He kneaded her breasts gently. The softness of her skin was comforting to him, and as he squeezed her he could feel the tension begin to ease. He kissed her neck, slowly kissing down her soft shoulders, which sent a shiver down his body. He gently kissed each, and then her breasts, as he lifted one and slowly took it into her mouth. He could see her nipples hardening through the small cotton dress that covered most of her chest.</p> <p>He slid his hand up her leg, his fingers trailing against her thigh...the one closest to him was slick with her juices. He gently stroked his thumb over the tip of his thumb, watching as her nipple grew and hardened, straining inside her dress as he continued to circle his thumb over her nipple. Her body started to tremble, and as his fingers moved further up her leg, his thumb brushed her lips, and she shivered.</p> <p>Suddenly, she arched her body slightly, and as his hand cupped her left breast, she arched once more. Her nipple jumped and hardened against his palm. He took her nipple between his thumb and forefinger, gently tugging on the soft flesh.</p> <p>'Ohhhh...m-mm' she sighed.</p> <p>He slid his hand down her stomach, to her crotch. He could feel the thin material of her panties, damp with her arousal. He lifted his hand to his lips, smelling her before lowering his lips to kiss the back of his hand, tasting her. He slid one finger across her lips, tasting her. He could still taste her on his finger. He could still taste her on him.</p> <p>'I want you.'</p> <p>********</p> <p>The next morning as he pulled up in front of her house, he could see her looking out towards the street, and he had an idea that she hadn't seen him in her house yet. He quickly walked into the house and turned on the light. But before he could open the door, she was standing close to him. She turned away from him, and stepped towards his bedroom. She reached for his belt and he pulled back at the same time. Her hand had only just escaped his belt, and he tried with all his might to keep from yanking her hand away as he slammed his fist onto the wall.</p> <p>'M-mistress...' She stopped suddenly, eyes wide, and her hands were fumbling with his belt. 'We're in here...' Her voice was trembling.</p> <p>'I'm sorry, mistress, but you look all wet. What are you doing here?'</p> <p>She hesitated again. Her head was now almost touching the wall. 'Shh, just relax...I don't want to have to go back into the living room.' Her body was trembling with anger, with desire, and her eyes were closed, her mouth open. 'Please...' She had finally managed to get his belt unfastened.</p> <p>He slowly unbuttoned his pants, and slid them and his briefs down her legs, pulling them off with his feet asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
