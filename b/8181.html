There are other ways. Like your father. It's about what you and I can do for each other if we're willing to play this card. But I need to be honest. There are things that I'd still like to do. I don't want to be too pushy by it, but something is holding me back."</p> <p>After that one-syllable thought, I just held onto her and went with her. Of course, she was very gentle about it. But it was as though she and I were lovers. When we did the first dance, before dancing together, at first I only watched her, letting her see how good she looked in a dress, but then I had her and danced it in slow motion and, when we finished doing it, it was like she loved me for a different person.</p> <p>I got it.</p> <p>It took two years. She and I talked all the time and we got to talking before dinner. My mom never stopped asking me to try something.</p> <p>At our wedding, I got her on the bed with me. After it, he made love to her then did the same to me. He and I shared a lot. There was mutual, unspoken bond that went way back to the day I first saw her. Once she gave birth to my brother, we all went our separate ways.</p> <p>Then it was my turn.</p> <p>We sat down at my house one evening and talked. Mom sat across from me next to John. There were a few more conversations. When I'd finished with my brother in no uncertain terms, Mom came over and sat down next to me again. She looked up at me. "Is everything okay with you and John?"</p> <p>The way we looked at each other with each question was a turn of events that I still remember.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>Mom looked down towards the floor. "Do you know how to do this?" She reached out and took my hand. "My brother?"</p> <p>"Is it okay?"</p> <p>"Yes, it's really okay with me." Mom looked up at me.</p> <p>"Do you have any idea what sort of thing I want? Are we going to do things that aren't normally a problem with other people? Do you know what kind of thing is good or bad?"</p> <p>I paused. "I guess I was trying to tell you what kinds of things I was thinking about, but I'm afraid to go there."</p> <p>"What types of things are you thinking about?" Mom asked me as she looked back to my face.</p> <p>"There are lots. I was thinking lots of things about you."</p> <p>"What's your point?"</p> <p>"If you're so certain, why don't you ask me? Is there any reason you can't?"</p> <p>She looked back at me for a few moments. "The reason you're so sure isn't that you think you can go from wanting me to wanting you to go from knowing I want you to wanting me to wanting you?" Mom seemed sad as she looked at me.</p> <p>"There is no reason for that. I've thought about this and don't."</p> <p>"You think?"</p> <p>"I think. I know it isn't a good idea to go there in the first place. But there is a reason for that, isn't there?"</p> <p>"Of course there is. I want to know what it is. Who is the lover and who, and how, and why..."</p> <p>"I know we might not be together, like we are now. And then I wouldn't just want you to love me as your lover, the way I love you."</p> <p>"But I love you!"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I love you, and it is wrong to take you to that place where we've been. I'm afraid I may be hurting you or, rather, that we might not be as good together. I'm sure you feel the same way. I want you to want me to want you, but not be against the world's rules or anything like that. I want to know where I stand with you and with other people for who you are. I love you, and, if I'm wrong, I guess I hate it and I like being with you, too."</p> <p>Before I could stop myself, I leaned back, took her face in my hands and kissed her mouth. Her arms came up around my neck, but I still had my hands on her body.</p> <p>Mom's hands started to travel over my body, as she pulled me hard against her. I don't know if I could have felt more lustful.</p> <p>We kissed for a long while. I pulled away from her. "You really know how to kiss, don't you?"</p> <p>"I'm going to get some practice," she laughedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
