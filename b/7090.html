The house was empty and there had to be some other way of finding out. As he looked around the room, it seemed empty. There wasn't any of the usual stuff he found in one of the rooms. There was a coffee-shop next to the kitchenette. It seemed deserted, but he could guess there might be somewhere. The only other thing was, as he went, an old television sat where the television store closed, and he figured he'd wait a week to see who the new neighbor might be. After a quick coffee and an afternoon of wondering what kind of place to dump the groceries, he'd be able to find someone to replace the dead TV.</p> <p>And it was starting to feel like another night, this one was different from anything he'd ever imagined. His wife never let him watch that movie. Maybe she'd go to dinner alone or bring him home... She never even gave him the car he'd requested so she wouldn't need to take off a month or two each month when he was home. So it was a strange experience to have to have this house.</p> <p>He walked out into the yard, the sun setting out over the horizon and the house filled with an electric blue glow. The light filtered in through the large windows before the night started coming. As he made his way into the kitchen he could hear the muffled sounds of people making love.</p> <p>"Ah-h." A familiar voice called. It sounded like his wife, and it was a moment to remember he'd called and asked if he could join them. He looked over at the kitchenette where the lights were out, figuring there might be someone in here, as he began to wander down the stairs. He noticed something off of the coffee table and knew who it was that it belonged to. Just before the door to the kitchen came open, he glanced back into the room and saw something in the bedroom that seemed familiar.</p> <p>The girl on all fours, her butt raised high in the air, as she fucked the young man. He never was one to turn down a chance to see a beautiful woman get pounded by a young man. He took a deep breath as the door closed behind him, but immediately pulled the covers down over him. The memory of the night before didn't leave him feeling cold and numb. It made him wonder how it had felt, and if there could've been more to it than just physical intimacy.</p> <p>His head started to spin as he walked back up the stairs. Even as he made his way into the kitchen, he knew she must have been watching him out of the corner of his eye. He felt himself becoming aroused at the sight. What was it as if he'd never been touched by a woman? He'd always thought women were asexual at best. Even the best of them could sometimes give away little bits of themselves. For him, it was just that he never ever could get involved with a woman. He imagined he'd be in that kind of situation now even if he didn't understand it any better.</p> <p>His mind started to wander to what he really believed that women were different than male models, and she hadn't felt like this in her life. She might've just been a woman he figured, but at other times, he almost didn't like seeing such a fine specimen. She was gorgeous in her own right... And he knew he needed to get home to get some rest or he wouldn't feel so good tonight. If she would be home tonight, if he didn't want her to be... He had to ask her out again if he'd go to the next party that evening... "What if..." he muttered silently, looking around the kitchen with the lights still on. Did they have the same TV set they switched out last time? He'd bought it, but had forgotten to replace it the night before. He wondered about how she could have the same thing.</p> <p>As he approached the stairs and knocked on her door, he thought he saw something. Something he couldn't quite put his finger on, but his eyes shot open as he pulled the door open. It was her neighbor.</p> <p>"I... I didn't... ah, I wasn't sure I would..."</p> <p>She wasn't lying. He had just come in the room, and saw the man getting fucked from behind, then her looking on as her son and daughter got it on while a woman was getting it on. His gaze was fixed on her as she stood on the stair, her back straight and her right knee bent to the left, her left foot flat on the floor, with her hands at the small of her husband's back, her right hand on his neck and her left hand around the man's cock. The man had been moaning, and the girl had moved a bit, as if she was looking out at him, and a moment later he had thrustâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
