I mean, you've got one for me too."</p> <p>"Well, as I was saying, I'm sure you can get it again."</p> <p>"Good. Maybe I can," he said, reaching down and taking hold of her cock, "But I don't think I can."</p> <p>"Well you can if you want to. So, get it ready."</p> <p>I was in the corner in my room just staring at my own nakedness, when Rob grabbed my arm and dragged me up off of the bed. I could feel the excitement of being watched and wanted every movement.</p> <p>"You're going to put it like this?" he asked as he helped me put the head at my entrance, "And I've still got the head of your cock inside. That's good."</p> <p>"I know it is. I think a good fucking is more important to me. So, I think you'd better make me come. Now."</p> <p>"That's good, babe," he said.</p> <p>"I am so wet right now I've never had one inside me. It's like it really hurts when it's inside me. So, please get it ready."</p> <p>"No problem, I'm ready to be inside you, babe," he said, "So, I'm going to do it."</p> <p>"And I thought you were going to say no," I said with a mischievous grin, "That it would hurt a little."</p> <p>He smiled back, and the more I talked to him the more he was turned on as I felt him begin to push into me, and I could feel the warmth of his cock as it slid in and out of me. After a couple of minutes of him slowly sliding into me, he was able to get deeper and more of his cock in me. I could tell his cock was sliding in and out of me, but he was looking at it.</p> <p>"So, how does that feel?" I said, letting him know.</p> <p>"It's really good," he said. "Like a woman. You really enjoy it."</p> <p>"Mmm, I like it a lot. I love the feeling of a hard cock inside me," I said, "And not just your dick. It feels like a pussy."</p> <p>"It's different," he continued, "In my case a woman's pussy is a bit of a 'slut,' or 'homo.' It's a special feeling, a woman is a sex object for men, but a woman's body is sex."</p> <p>"A woman has a special place in the world for men and women," I said, "In my opinion. And it's a beautiful place to be and I know it's sexy to be having such a turn with two beautiful cocks inside you."</p> <p>"But what about your own?" he asked, "And how does it feel? Does it feel good?"</p> <p>"Mmm, I'll show you," I said, standing up and looking at him, "And you can get your turn for the time being. We have plenty of time."</p> <p>"But it's not like before," he said, "No way is it different now that you want to get it over with. I haven't had a cock inside me for almost two weeks."</p> <p>"We've only got time for one."</p> <p>"But I like it a lot. How would it feel if I was a guy? Or a woman?"</p> <p>"Of course you're a woman," I said, "That's why it feels good. It feels different."</p> <p>"Yeah, but then there's a reason. I don't find a single guy I like having sex with much better. So, you're still going to have to give me an 'oral' turn?" said Rob.</p> <p>"I think so. I've only been with one guy. But I don't know any other. Not even in a hundred years. And I think you'll be just as great as I am."</p> <p>"You've got to have the balls to do what I want," he said.</p> <p>"I'll try, but I don't know what it would feel like to have another guy inside me," I said.</p> <p>"I want to try too. But it might hurt a little at first," he said.</p> <p>"I don't think you should get hurt," I said.</p> <p>"Hey, it's okay, you can try, trust me," he said.</p> <p>"Please don't make this harder than it needs be," I said as I looked him in the eye.</p> <p>"It won't beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
