The woman seemed to have fallen asleep in his lap and he felt her body against him, and when she finally started to stir a bit and look around the room he found that the curtains had parted enough to reveal the sight of a man standing near a fire. He could just barely make out the woman sitting there, but from the flickering candlelight he couldn't help but think that she must be his boss, that she had to be. "Sh..." He began, knowing the reason she was laying there was her husband in fact. He thought it might be the husband he had heard of and had been forced to meet in the hotel room...and with her husband on the other team, it was easy to assume that it was him or rather the wife. However he had to assume that she was his boss and what that meant was quite simply that she was there to see him, and he had a suspicion that this man was someone she had worked with many times at the hotel before and who would be a problem to deal with. Suddenly, as he was thinking this, his mouth found hers and the taste of blood instantly filled him and caused the feeling of warmth he had felt between his legs began to increase. The woman shifted a bit towards a different angle and the lips that he was about to French kiss pressed harder against him and his cock surged in response. He pulled his mouth away after a few moments but the lust in his eyes was still there and he was soon kissing her like the man he had been with earlier as well, and she responded in kind, sliding her tongue into his mouth and pressing her pussy up against him. Without even realizing that the kiss had started without him he had opened his pants just when she slipped out from between them and began sliding them down, her wetness instantly soaking into the thin material of his underwear and his boxers as he pulled them the rest of the way off. Once she had pulled her hand out from between his legs and had freed one of his hands, he wrapped it behind his head and lifted his hand and slid it along one of her breasts, pressing them together so that his other hand was at her crotch but she immediately pushed him away, "Leave it there." She said. And without giving him time to comply, she began grinding her hips back against his hand and his now hard cock, "You know you wanted to take it," She whispered into his ear, "But I don't mind if you keep touching me until it happens, I'm so horny now." And with that she leaned back on her hands and he could feel the heat from her body. Her skin was so soft and the feel of her in his hand made him tingle all over. His cock was already getting even harder as he realized that she was not wearing panties. The thought of her pussy being touched by his fingers caused it to jump in response and he started playing with it to try and get some friction against it. He slid his middle finger along the outside of her pussy lips and started teasing them while still using his thumb to rub the outside of her clit. Her hands quickly released their grip and gripped the edges of the bed and she sat up to pull him into the center of the room but he was too late. Before he got his chance she was pulling his underwear off of him and her hand immediately found his hard cock. "Don't you dare tease me, I want that cock in my hand." She demanded, which was all the encouragement he needed.</p> <p>Without any hesitation he pressed his pants to his ankles and stepped out of them off as well, his boxers quickly followed by his underwear which he tossed aside with the rest as well. He grabbed her hand and pulled her back towards him, kissing her deeply and moaning with a combination of pleasure and pain as his cock slid against her belly and pressed against her mound. He broke the kiss and looked into her eyes as he pushed her down until her back was against the wall and then lifted her into the air until her legs were wrapped around his hips and his cock was buried deeper than before. He began to lift her up using a force that she had never felt before and as she began to work against him with her hips he began to thrust into her harder and harder until he was practically in pain. Not knowing what the woman wanted, he could only give it to her and he knew that he wouldn't be able to hold it, she had been so wet as he fucked her that the first time she had cum he would just have to let her cum. The thought of cumming in a woman had always been his most fantasy and once he realized how much better he would have gotten out of this he knew it wasn't fair that the woman he was fucking was making love to him in this manner. He had been her boss and for years been her lover, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
