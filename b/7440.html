The way he was sitting, I'd believe I was sitting up. She looked up at him and bit her lip. He looked away, trying to ignore the way her breasts felt as they shifted within the folds of her robe.</p> <p>"I don't understand. You had something to do with that," she whispered with a look of concern.</p> <p>"I just wanted to take a girl out, take this back and make her mine," he told her.</p> <p>He saw her lips move over to hold his face in the palm of her hand, and he knew she had something that he still had to make amends to. It must have been a bad idea because he leaned across the table and kissed her lips for what seemed like an eternity. He couldn't get enough of her mouth. The way the dress felt as it hung on her, he knew she wasn't the type.</p> <p>The way he'd feel her body against his as they kissed.</p> <p>Her mouth turned into a smile and she leaned in even closer to him. They were both breathing heavily when she took his hand and placed it on her stomach. He started to rub the flatness of his hand against her thigh while he tried to catch his breath. Then she leaned her head away for a moment, looking at the table.</p> <p>"I don't think I can take any more," she said and took a sip of her drink, trying to catch her breath.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked with a look of concern.</p> <p>"I'm sure," she responded with a wink.</p> <p>He was about to turn red, as he thought of it, but he couldn't.</p> <p>The way she looked at him with that coy look on her face, he wanted to ask something else. He was still trying to recover from their kiss. It was hard right then. He moved his hand away to the table top, hoping it had just fallen off.</p> <p>She saw his hand as it went to her neck. It was slowly sliding down to just below her chin. She knew he did that as she watched him.</p> <p>"Do you remember that look on my face when you gave me that look? The one we shared last night?" she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, that one," he managed to get out, remembering he still had his hand on her.</p> <p>She looked away for a second, as the waiter returned with the check.</p> <p>"I'm sorry we haven't talked about it. I know that you enjoyed tonight. I've seen you with other boys too," she said looking at him.</p> <p>"Yeah. Only one other," he replied, trying to remember.</p> <p>A look of disappointment crossed her face as he was right about her. She knew it and felt uncomfortable for it to show.</p> <p>"The other one? I was just supposed to pick up you a cab?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nope, I guess we better get out of there," he replied, knowing all too well what was going to happen before they left.</p> <p>His hand went back to her shoulder and he slid it under her robe and felt her breast. She sighed as he ran his hand over her breast. The way she looked, it was a turn on to know what her nipples were doing beneath her robe while they kissed.</p> <p>When they stood up, the feeling of her breasts coming free was too much to handle. He couldn't bring himself to take his eyes off her.</p> <p>"Do you like how they feel," she whispered against his lips before she could stop herself.</p> <p>"I- I love them," he told her.</p> <p>She didn't say a word as he continued to play with her breasts. They fit perfectly inside the lace. The way his fingers slid over them as he lifted each one slightly and tweaked her nipples.</p> <p>"I'm not going to make you pay for that," he whispered back, leaning his lips to kiss her neck.</p> <p>"You are a bastard," she whispered as she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him closer.</p> <p>"I don't care," he told her.</p> <p>They reached their table as the waiter came over and handed them their meals. They sat for a moment as their stomachs grew.</p> <p>"Well. I had some wine in me while we waited," he said, trying not to let on what was going on.</p> <p>"Why don't you go with a glass of red now?" she said as she leaned towards him, offering the glasses to him.</p> <p>He took them from her and drank deeply while she looked at him.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked as her eyes closed and she leaned against him.</p> <p>"I want to make you feel good," he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"I don't want to do thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
