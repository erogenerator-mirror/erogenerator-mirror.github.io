His cock was hard again. It could have been a little more but his dick wasn't ready for action yet.</p> <p>When he looked at her she had her hand on either side of her face. She was looking up at him and smiling. I wanted to suck on her nipples!</p> <p>When she saw that I was looking at her her mouth opened and she softly smiled and moved her breasts toward me. We kissed at the same time. Her mouth was so soft, so wet, the kisses were really hot, and I liked it. It turned me on a lot. She sucked on my tongue and then she let go of my tongue and sucked on my earlobe, pulling me into her mouth. I knew what she wanted!</p> <p>I felt her mouth sliding down to my cock which was now so hard and so hot. She just took my cock and sucked my balls. I liked this! She was using her hands and mouth to make me hard for her.</p> <p>She started to move her mouth down again on my cock, sliding it all the way down to the back of her throat and sliding it back up and then she sucked both balls in her mouth. It felt great. She had the greatest mouth on earth.</p> <p>I loved feeling her lips on my balls so I wanted to do the same. Our rhythm was getting faster.</p> <p>Suddenly she stopped sucking on my balls. She smiled and said, "Don't stop, I like that!"</p> <p>I didn't want to stop it. I lifted her a little and put my hands around each of her buttcheeks, pulling her pussy toward me. My cock was right in between her soft thighs, sticking up at right angles. She reached her arms in front of her body over my head and pulled me toward her.</p> <p>I got the idea. I pulled her body toward me and she was standing against my body. My cock was standing up straight up, sticking out in front of my body.</p> <p>She slid one arm over and around my neck, pulling my face into her soft hair. She kissed me and then said, "I liked your dick that much better than my husband's. Do it again, but harder."</p> <p>"That's good, " I said, "do it some more."</p> <p>I started to pull her asscheeks apart as I put my knees between hers. She took the hint and moved her body closer to me. Her mouth came down around the head of my cock and she began to lick the tip of it and then she took it in her mouth. I knew I was about to cum real soon. She took her mouth off it and looked up at me. I pulled her in tight against my body.</p> <p>"Can you do that any more?" I asked.</p> <p>"If you can, I can do it again. But don't you cum until I say so!"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"That way when you finish I'll know it and when I cum it will be just like last time." She leaned back and said, "Ok, if you can't, you will let me finish. Ok?"</p> <p>It seemed like she was trying to say something but I didn't understand her. She had moved her tongue, I guess because she was trying to say something. I held her tightly to me and she put her arm around my neck. She started to move back and forth on my cock. I could feel my balls get tighter and tighter.</p> <p>Finally I couldn't take it anymore. It felt like my ass was going to take a hit and my legs were going to give out. I said, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry. I can't. I'm done"</p> <p>She let go of me and I could feel my cum slowly leaking out of me into her mouth. She got up, smiled then stood next to her husband. I moved my body so I was on the couch. My cock was still in her hand.</p> <p>I looked over at my wife and she had her hand on her lips. The look in her eyes and she was looking back at me.</p> <p>As I sat there watching my love making with my wife, I said, "This was incredible!"</p> <p>Just then her eyes opened and smiled at me. I had a look of contentment and happiness on my face.</p> <p>"You're sure you have to say something?" I asked her.</p> <p>She nodded her head and said, "Yes, I'm glad you enjoyed what we were doing, too."</p> <p>"That's great!" I said. "Are we done?"</p> <p>"Well, I guess we can go back to the way things had been." She said grinning, "Do you want to make love to the woman you love?"</p> <p>All of a sudden it dawned on me what she'd just said to himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
