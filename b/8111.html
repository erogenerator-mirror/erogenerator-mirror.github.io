I tried to move fast so that I could look at the woman. My heart nearly stopped, or maybe it just stopped beating... I didn't have it in me to do what comes naturally.</p> <p>"Oh no, don't move," a woman's voice said. "Stay there, and keep those ears."</p> <p>She reached my ear, and then started to gently nibble on it. A soft voice said, "Keep your ear open little one, this must be one, now..."</p> <p>She slowly traced her tongue from my ear to the tip of my shaft, then down again, and the tip again slowly opened, showing the clear, clear precum. She teased the tip with her tongue again, a soft, warm, wet sound. My eyes were drawn to the woman's breasts, they looked so soft, with her nipples hard, erect, and inviting. Her breasts were large and beautifully formed. And they were topped with pink areolas on top of a nice, smallish, small nipple. The tip was the same skin color as my cock, but it was perfectly round. She began sucking her way up my shaft, then took my balls in her mouth.</p> <p>"Ohhh, nice," I said. The woman looked to the door, then back to the door. "I can't believe this, this is her, the one..."</p> <p>"She does like you," a voice finally whispered. Again, I tried to move. I could feel the excitement rising in me. The woman continued sucking on my rod.</p> <p>I began looking to the other side as the woman brought me to the edge, then stopped.</p> <p>"Can I come, do you mind?" she asked.</p> <p>My heart was racing. I couldn't believe it. There it was. It looked like my cock, it looked so hard. I took my penis, and moved it up and forward, feeling it move into places that we have only done in a hundred men. I felt the woman move on top of it. She had a smile on her face. She was obviously enjoying herself.</p> <p>The woman whispered in my ear, she then took my ball, and gently took one into her mouth, and sucked on it. I moaned louder than I've ever made a sound before. She was so different from the women on my shaft. The woman kept sucking, then gently taking my other ball, and then taking it again into her mouth. "Mmmmm," I whispered. I wanted more. The woman removed my ball, and took her cock and balls into her mouth, then worked them as I watched her. She was in control, and she was doing it for me.</p> <p>I kept myself on the edge for what seemed like minutes. I felt my body being teased. There was no way I was going to cum. Not with the woman beneath me making love to me. The woman let my balls drop, then she moved to sit on the bed beside me. My heart was racing, like it was high on out of control. I turned to look at her smiling face as she looked at me. She put her hand on my chest and ran her fingers through my hair and back and forth.</p> <p>"It tastes so good", she said. I felt the excitement in her voice as she said it. The sensation of her fingers on my chest as she ran her fingers through my hair felt wonderful. I watched her fingers run through my hair and down my front.</p> <p>"You know you like it, don't you, you little perv," the woman said. It was a new sensation. I could not believe she knew that I was thinking. There was an excitement there that I didn't understand.</p> <p>"Uh... Yeah," I finally replied. She leaned toward me, then whispered, "Good, because I do love it. I couldn't do it like that.</p> <p>"But I love you, too," she whispered. I watched as she held my head in her hands, gently running her fingers down my face. I felt her hands run through my hair and head.</p> <p>"Mmm," she said. She then moved her face towards my cock and lips. I opened my mouth invitingly and kissed the woman. She pushed my head into her while I kissed her.</p> <p>While I kissed her, she ran my tongue along the length of her lips. I wanted to taste the woman on my tongue. I wanted to lick the woman's tongue. I kissed her lower lip before taking her lower lip into my mouth and sucking on it. It was so soft, so warm, so wonderful.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she said. She pushed my head back into the chair and looked down at me. "Does this feel good?"</p> <p>"It's all yours," I said.
