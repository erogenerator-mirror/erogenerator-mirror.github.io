We could, of course, still have intercourse in public, but we'd never really do that again.'</p> <p>'Oh, it would be exciting, I mean, you know, what I wouldn't do if the public area were all naked! I mean, what if we went there for the first time and the police would discover us? Wouldn't we just let them have an embarrassing moment?'</p> <p>'Well, if we did that, it might just be a little better for everyone, wouldn't it?'</p> <p>'If we took you at the police station.' I said, almost indignantly.</p> <p>'Oh, really, you wouldn't mind?'</p> <p>'Of course I'd say absolutely, but not on anything, you know, public.'</p> <p>'But I don't suppose you want to go, do you?'</p> <p>'Of course I do.'</p> <p>'And what if, on some day I get my chance, you're in the police force?'</p> <p>'Of course, why not? What man wouldn't want to go to some of those sorts of events?'</p> <p>'I don't suppose you're suggesting I'd do something like that?'</p> <p>'I suppose not, you've been a very naughty boy, haven't you?'</p> <p>'Well no, of course not.'</p> <p>'But in the same way you did, don't you?'</p> <p>'Yes, of course, I suppose so, if it makes you feel better.'</p> <p>'Don't be silly, of course not, but sometimes it makes me feel pretty.'</p> <p>'Don't you feel a little naughty, if that makes you feel naughty.'</p> <p>'Sometimes I do feel quite lovely, when I don't get my own way about that.'</p> <p>'If you go to some of those sorts of events?'</p> <p>'Of course I do, I suppose I would. I'll be honest, no, if I do, I don't know if I can resist it if you do.'</p> <p>'Well, maybe I've given you a little something to think about.'</p> <p>Well, it wouldn't be much of a 'little something', would it?'</p> <p>'No. Well, yes, if it makes you feel good. But wouldn't happen if you did.'</p> <p>'Of course not. I'll take my chances.'</p> <p>'Perhaps you are making a fool of yourself.'</p> <p>'Well, yes, I suppose so, that's why I should've avoided those kinds of events.'</p> <p>'So you don't want me to do anything, wouldn't you want to do to me?'</p> <p>'Of course I do.'</p> <p>'And what would you tell me to do if I went through with it?'</p> <p>'I don't know, think about it, then you can decide. But, I suppose there are other things you could do, things that you wouldn't do for a stranger. You wouldn't like what I did to you, would you?'</p> <p>'Wouldn't I?'</p> <p>'Of course not. But I would have the opportunity, you know, to take you with me to some of those events, or perhaps to go back and see you again.'</p> <p>"In all good spirits, I think, I'm going to enjoy this."</p> <p>I was actually grinning now. I'd found the secret to me. It could be, after all, true, but that might make the time go by much quicker. But what if I went somewhere with one of the girls, one of the officers would, in effect, see me at any of those events? I wondered if even Mrs. O'Hara would be okay with it, if I went there with this girl. In any case, I had to get back to work. After all, we had only had lunch there once, and that was a very pleasant affair. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea of spending some time with this lovely fellow. It seemed to be possible that I could find myself, for a fraction of an afternoon, in a similar circumstance with that girl. But I wasn't so sure about Mrs. O'Hara; I had to check my feelings about her. She was just a lovely girl, and she was definitely worth spending time with. And then I made a couple of more assumptions.</p> <p>"Mrs. O'Hara, I'll be honest, I would be quite happy to go into the police station, you know?
