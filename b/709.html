It's been five months since we have made love and now we are having fun? We have been having fun? This is fun. The fact that we actually have sex now doesn't even need to be mentioned does, I just know it does!</p> <p>I was really going to get a little bored without Mom.</p> <p>Mom went on. "I know it takes time to figure out what sex is. I have to get myself to a point where you can start to feel the way that you do when your partner is near. That will be so much better than the one you have with your lover, in my opinion. I can teach you more, but right now I am going to get ready for bed first." She put her bra and pajama bottoms on and turned to the head of the bed, smiled at me as she did.</p> <p>I went through the normal routine of pulling on the night shirt, then my robe. I noticed a small wet mark on the side of the sheet that she had made when I tried to keep my head turned to look at her breasts.</p> <p>When she was ready to do my hair the night before I turned to look at that spot. My robe was completely opened about half way, and I had to bend over as she turned me around so I was looking at her body and not the sheet.</p> <p>"No," she called out for me. "I'm still a little scared. Don't worry. I'm going to get a lot of sleep now."</p> <p>I picked off the sheets that covered her and left them on the side near the foot of the bed. I looked behind me and thought if I could just reach that spot and just reach it the bed would be as naked as I was!</p> <p>After a moment of searching I came up with a big pair of boxer briefs that covered my bulge. I grabbed my robe from the corner of the bed and slipped on a pair of jeans. I looked at Mom as I put them on and looked at how good they looked on me.</p> <p>I pulled the top over my head and quickly pulled it on. I checked my makeup to be sure that wasn't a wet mark. When I was dressed I walked into the bathroom to change clothes. I went into the laundry room and changed into a pair of workout shorts and a loose fitting T-shirt that matched the shirt. I grabbed the dryer and started it.</p> <p>I put the clothes in the hamper that was just outside and started on my shirt. I picked up the shorts and T-shirt, and started putting on my socks. When my socks were all the way on, I left the socks on so I could do the other side without a problem. I looked at myself in the mirror to make sure that they fit a little better before grabbing my boxers to pull them up. I finished off my look and then grabbed my bag as I headed back out into the bedroom.</p> <p>I grabbed the bag of laundry and turned the shower on. I quickly cleaned everything up before deciding to get dressed myself. I made my way into the bedroom and sat on the bed with my bag.</p> <p>I was really looking forward to getting to sleep. By the time I headed back to my room to change for bed in, I had time to think about something.</p> <p>I got in the shower and washed myself, and then got dressed. By the time I was finished putting on the last thing that I had been thinking about, the shower door opened and Mom poked her head in, wearing a robe.</p> <p>"Come on. I'll get the bag and head for the kitchen. You go right ahead," Mom told me as she started toward the stairs.</p> <p>"OK," I called after her, feeling bad.</p> <p>I opened up the door to get the bag and set it down at my feet. I headed for my room to get a towel, and a robe so that I could cover up as I went.</p> <p>I opened the door to my room and set it down at the foot of the bed, leaving it open. I then closed the door gently and climbed into bed.</p> <p>I turned my light on before laying my head down next to her and laying my hand softly on her stomach. I pulled her robe open and took a moment to admire the soft skin that showed. With a hand caressing her bellybutton I could feel the goose bumps starting to rise on her breasts. I felt her hand reach my crotch and grasp the waistband of my shorts. "Goodnight Mom, Mom!" I called out as I rolled over.</p> <p>"I'll be in the room in a sec, be quiet."</p> <p>"OK," I responded as I turned my attention to her. "I won't be any longer than you are right now. Sleep now."</p> <p>"Goodnight Tim. Sleep well. Goodnight," she replied as she turnedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
