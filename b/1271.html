Karen gasped as she was spread-eagled. The feeling was incredible. The moment it took for the head of my cock to penetrate her body I was so aroused I couldn't stand it. The pressure of the head was almost unbearable but it was so worth it. I forced myself in deeper. I felt like my cock was going to explode. She felt different than her girlfriends. I felt different than any other woman I could recall. There was no way she could ever take me so fully into her. It was as though she was afraid, her fear being replaced with the fear that I wouldn't fully fill her completely with my cock. Then, all things stopped as suddenly as they started. I didn't move, she didn't move and suddenly we were still. We just lie there in the soft afterglow. We lay there for a minute or two, our breath returning to normal when suddenly we both realized that the pressure in the bed had subsided.</p> <p>"That was incredible. That was incredible. I didn't think I could last through that." Karen was gasping for air.</p> <p>I laughed. "Don't you worry. I'm not through with you yet. I've just got to make some changes to make myself cum. After you've cum I'm going to make you have an orgasm with this inside of you."</p> <p>We laid there side by side in an armchair, enjoying the moment. I kissed each of her tears. "I feel awful that anyone could still feel this way. I have never experienced so much pleasure as I did before with you, Karen. I don't know how I can tell you how incredible it was."</p> <p>Karen began crying again. I held her tightly and hugged her closely. I could feel that she was shaking. I could feel her tears flowing down her face as she sobbed into my chest. Her body was trembling. I ran my hand over her body, feeling her trembling breasts. As she moved against my hands I kissed her on the face, her forehead, her cheeks and on her lips.</p> <p>Karen broke away. "I have never done anything like that before. You are unbelievable. It was my first experience with another woman. I don't think I'll ever forget it."</p> <p>She smiled. "Me too."</p> <p>"That was amazing, too. God, you're so erotic. I can't believe you've never experienced anything like that before."</p> <p>"I never thought about it."</p> <p>I kissed her softly. "I know what you mean. It was never my intention to make you feel like that. You were so beautiful."</p> <p>She giggled. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you, too, Karen," I replied.</p> <p>With her head on my shoulder, her face turned to me with a shy smile.</p> <p>"We should try that again."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I thought she looked like a kitten that was getting the cream. I had to remind myself that I hadn't even tried to make her climax yet, so perhaps it was the least I could do.</p> <p>This time I was ready to make love to her.</p> <p>I got up and said, "Strip. I don't want to wear a condom or anything else. I will take good care of you.</p> <p>"I guess that I have the right to get you to do that."</p> <p>"Yeah, you can still have me, baby. I won't take no for an answer." "I'll be gentle," I assured her. "Just make sure you have your climax firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
