Why are you so upset that I'm in here watching you all day," she asked rhetorically and with a sarcastic tone.</p> <p>"My parents are having a picnic this week," I said with a laugh and a nervous laugh.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I told them that they would have to come and join me if they wanted to go."</p> <p>"That's not what I meant," Emily said as she took a step toward me.</p> <p>"They came and joined me," I assured her.</p> <p>"Let's stay," Emily requested of me.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"My parents are going to be pissed at me for not telling them they were going there," Emily answered.</p> <p>"You told them about me watching you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes I did," she answered.</p> <p>"What did you tell them?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I think I told them about us but I don't know if you know what it is," she quipped as she moved to sit next to me on the bed.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that I do either," I stated matter of factly. "I'm also not sure how you feel about that."</p> <p>"Don't worry about me, I love you," Emily stated. "That is to say a lot of things about me that you have ignored."</p> <p>"I love you too," I said sincerely and I truly meant it.</p> <p>"Goodbye, I love you too."</p> <p>"Bye," I said softly as I held her hand in mine. I hoped that I wouldn't find out that she had been watching me all afternoon. What if I did? The thought that someone might see us was enough to cause a reaction. What if she had been sitting with me all afternoon? I thought. I was sure of that. I had no doubt how hard it would be to let that happen.</p> <p>As the rest of our day passed Emily seemed to be doing the same thing that I had been doing all along. We were going to spend the day together and we were going to have a picnic so we could spend the rest of the day together. We both just wanted to be alone together and we didn't care about anything other than making love. I was thankful that she didn't see it as as just a fling, just an afternoon off and on. If she had only known that I secretly wanted too. I really needed to try it but wasn't sure if I wanted to admit it to myself. Maybe I was too shy to be honest about it.</p> <p>In the early afternoon when our parents were out we ate lunch together and ate our sandwiches. We both wanted to talk about what had just transpired between us and to share our feelings. It was only after we finished lunch that I decided it was time to tell her the truth.</p> <p>"Emily, I can never be sure that you liked what I saw," I stated with just a hint of nervousness.</p> <p>I think she sensed the change of the mood between us.</p> <p>"I am always turned on by you," she said softly in a more seductive tone.</p> <p>"I think it's time for us to go for a swim," I offered and I had no idea if I could go through with it. I'm sure that she knew she should have had a chance to discuss that matter with me but she just had to be in the mood.</p> <p>"I told you that I've only been out here for a few hours," Emily answered me.</p> <p>"Well I'll walk you back to your apartment. I'm sure that I can still turn you on even more without going upstairs," I offered. I wanted to let her know that she was still making a huge impression on me.</p> <p>"No you won't. That's too bad of a view and you'll really end up walking us back. I was looking forward to you leaving my place," Emily said and she didn't seem to realize that it would have done her no good.</p> <p>"Okay," I answered honestly hoping that I couldn't keep telling her I was not happy about her seeing me.</p> <p>"I've just got to tell you the rest of the story because you're going to have to tell me the whole story and I don't want you to just listen as it happened. I'm not ready for one of those 'accidental' stories that we do every so often. So if you don't want to hear the whole story then just let me in. I'll listen," she said in a way that I was unsure how to respond.</p> <p>"Okay," I said as I reached into my pocket and pulled out three dollar bills.
