I told her, kissing her temple.</p> <p>"I know, now, you can make the arrangements," Lillian said. "I'm so excited."</p> <p>"I just know what I have to," I smiled, kissing her lips. "I'm in."</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>The day following the birth of Amy got even better. Amy and I were so excited. It became a normal day for us, until Lillian came in, "She came as well," she said. "The rest of my team were there today and I think they're trying to get pregnant," she laughed.</p> <p>"Oh... they're trying!" Lillian laughed. "How long is it going to be before we have children, Amy?"</p> <p>"About one month, maybe two," Amy said, "But I'm ready to deliver, now."</p> <p>"Okay, okay..." Lillian agreed. "Let's get her on board."</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>I took the elevator up to Amy's apartment and she went and sat on the couch. I made the introductions and she smiled.</p> <p>"Where is your mother?" I asked.</p> <p>"She said her parents are there," Amy giggled. "She brought a friend too and they're with her, I hope she is okay."</p> <p>"She's fine," I smiled. "She'll talk to you later." "I guess she's going to stay the night with your mother tonight..."</p> <p>"She would be okay to be with me, I know," she smiled. "Let me sit down, please."</p> <p>"Okay," I smiled. I sat next to Amy, taking the small of her back and holding her, gently, "Are you okay, darling..."</p> <p>"No," Amy smiled, "I'm all yours tonight, my love."</p> <p>"Okay," I smiled. "Would you like to go inside with me?"</p> <p>"Yes, I would love to go inside, my love," Amy told me, kissing me.</p> <p>"I'm going to take a shower," I told her, "You go on up and get some dinner, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," she said, "I'll do that."</p> <p>I went upstairs to change clothes, so everyone could meet us in the kitchen for dinner. Lillian was still dressed in her gown, but she was sitting at the table talking with her parents. We finished our dinner and were all sitting around the table talking. Amy, Lillian and then mom left and I was watching the television. I got up and made a pitcher of iced tea and a light beer for each of the parents and I. Lillian's father asked if I was okay and I told him I was, but he didn't say anything.</p> <p>"That's ok," Amy smiled, "I'm glad dad is okay with us getting married and have a family."</p> <p>"He's excited too," Lillian laughed, "That's the nice thing about living together, you have friends and they're okay with it."</p> <p>"But he's my husband," Amy laughed. "The whole family is okay with me marrying him." "I think it's so cool."</p> <p>"I thought you had something planned for tonight, mom," Lillian told us, "and dad and I have to work tomorrow."</p> <p>"Yes," Amy said, her face a bright red. "But you all deserve so much happiness."</p> <p>Lillian and I both started laughing and Lillian sat down next to her mother. Lillian reached over and took my hand and squeezed it. Amy's face turned red and we all stood up and got one o'clock in town before we left.</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>The rest of the week went pretty much the same way, except for Lillian working for our company that day so we could do some work that day. I was surprised when she had dinner with me every night so she was a little tipsy when we got there. I spent every night with her so much that I woke up with my hand between our legs. I think it was pretty wild. We had sex for a long time, maybe five or six times before Lillian and I got some relief each night.</p> <p>After dinner, Lillian said she had to get up to shower. "I'm going up to the room, see you in a half an hour," Lillian announced, "Okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed, "Come here."</p> <p>As she walked me down the hall, she paused at the bedroom doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
