I was wondering how fast you had found out what was going on with you and your sister."</p> <p>"No, nothing like that. I didn't think you were going to come."</p> <p>"Well, I think I did. Why? How did you get here so fast? I could have gotten you off more than just watching."</p> <p>"So you watched or you saw?" My mind started to race, trying to recall all of the time I've spent over there and knowing that I was probably home at a dead end. "How the hell was I supposed to sneak in here so fast?" I thought to myself. Was she just being extra friendly, or was she just trying for a good time?</p> <p>I looked around, "I think I saw you checking to see if everything was okay, and you seemed to be doing something else."</p> <p>I heard her chuckle, "Well yes, I guess you were checking."</p> <p>"That's it, do I get my coat?" My question surprised her. "Sure. I'll grab the back of my car now, would you like me to come with, or is there anyone else you're going to be meeting here that is going to be meeting you?"</p> <p>"Yes, here. I'm not really sure where I'm going to be meeting."</p> <p>"Great. That should not be a problem." I got in my car, started it, and took off. "What's your address?" She asked.</p> <p>I knew I didn't want to tell her the number, or even what the address was, but the more I thought about it, the more my mind was going through the possibilities. "Um, well, well, maybe, well, the address is actually just below it." It seemed like a lame excuse.</p> <p>"Don't give the address up, or you'll be getting yourself pregnant."</p> <p>She laughed, "That's funny."</p> <p>"Well, that could be the answer I was hoping, but, well that certainly doesn't sound like your home. So, do you live in the city?"</p> <p>"Yea. My apartment is on Chestnut and was about twenty minutes away. It's right next to your office, probably close to yours." She handed me my driver's license and told me to pull up to the curb. I did, and she climbed out of her car. It seemed like we had been doing this for some time, and I guess we always used that to find our way home. I followed her home, and headed inside. I pulled out the card she gave me and asked her about how the weather turned out.</p> <p>"The weather was pretty good, I guess. Well, I had a nice summer and have a great fall, so it looks like I'm going to be getting a spring in my step. I guess it's been almost two weeks yet." She looked at some clouds and a slight wind in the middle of it, I assumed as rain? "How does it feel out there, to be a rainbird?"</p> <p>"Wonderful. I didn't know if you noticed."</p> <p>"Well that's ok."</p> <p>"It's been a good month." She paused for a second and then again looked at me with her dark eyes. "Well, it should be here soon. Would you do something for me?"</p> <p>"What would you like me to do?"</p> <p>"Well, get me a blanket or something and clean yourself up and then, well, we'll see. I really need to get ready, and I'll probably just come down there and shower, you know what I mean?" It felt good having her around, so I took her right back into my room. I pulled her into my shower at least a half mile away, and turned the water on. She let her arms hang low against the wall for balance, and then started to undress. "There's a nice looking tub under the shower. I like to think I'm pretty decent when I take them out. I probably should be paying attention to the weather better."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't expect it will get here tonight, I don't want to leave you out, do I?" She laughed.</p> <p>"Oh, you don't worry, I'll just let you join me. It might just be a little while." She took one of my arms and wrapped it around her waist and started to step into the water. As she did, the water ran down her legs and started to flow out, so she kept her legs wrapped around me, and we started to step into the water. I couldn't help noticing how nice it felt as the water ran down her legs, and how smooth her skin was. I felt her body under my arms and let her slowly sink into the water. As one stepped in, the water rushed against her legsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
