I wish to make her my slave. I want to take her, to make her my slave. Let her know that I am still not the Master and you are the slave to have."</p> <p>He had a look of surprise on his face when he heard the name of my name. My Master had a look of dread on his face when he said, "Yes, her Master will only obey my orders and not hurt you."</p> <p>He had a look of sadness again when he heard my name, but I could see that he was trying to put a hand to his face as he answered, "Oh, yes, she is still my little Sister." He looked to me, then back to my Goddess. "Are you ready to become your little slave?"</p> <p>"Yes, Master. My Master has given me my first task. I will have to show my Master how well I perform. Please, may I become your slave?"</p> <p>He said nothing, but his face had this strange smile for a moment. "Yes, little Sister. If your Master and you wish to be my slaves, take it." He looked at my Goddess smiling and said, "It is his pleasure to give my little Sister such a gift. He will not hurt me any more, but it will be his pleasure to show his slave and me that she is worthy of the gift of his gift."</p> <p>"But... he is such a beautiful boy. I do not want him to hurt you!"</p> <p>"He is your slave. I will obey his orders. Please, take this, and give it to me. This is what you have come to ask for."</p> <p>He smiled again and he handed my Goddess the little green collar, "She will be my little slave if you take it."</p> <p>I laughed lightly, "No, Master. I take it, but I must know that it is yours."</p> <p>"You will take it, but you can't ask it of me. It has to be yours that you take for your special pleasure."</p> <p>"Yes, Master."</p> <p>He took the little green collar from my hands and handed it to Goddess, "As he has said, I will be your Master, but it must be yours," my Goddess opened the little collar around my neck. She smiled at my expression of wonder, "She will be yours, Master."</p> <p>"I do love her, Master. Please make her my little slave."</p> <p>He smiled, reached out to me, then picked up the little green collar and threw it to my Goddess. She lifted it to her face, took it in her fingers and put the little green collar on my Goddess. The little green collar, with our Goddess's handwriting on it, looked more like a small white ball, and was engraved with our Goddess's mark on it. She picked up a small little white ball and I could see she lifted it toward my Goddess, and he placed a white gold ring to her right breast, and my Goddess lifted it to her left breast, and I could see the white jewel in full bloom, and the symbol of our Goddess was in my Goddess's ring and she nodded in agreement.</p> <p>He picked our little blue collar from her body and held it up, "You are so beautiful. Please take this and put it on her."</p> <p>"Do you believe me?"</p> <p>"Yes, Master. Of course, I believe you."</p> <p>"Then take this," he handed her the little blue collar.</p> <p>"I am no longer your slave. It is time for me to take what I am not ready for. I have lost my chance to be your slave, and not only because of it, but because it is not you I belong to. Please take this and give it to me." She took the little blue collar, handed it to me, and I put the collar around her neck. The little blue collar had a little yellow heart on it, and the little golden heart had three stars and two stars. "Your precious possession has allowed this collar to give you this gift. May you give it back."</p> <p>I picked up the small blue collar, handed it to her, and she handed the little golden collar back. "Can't I keep it?" she asked.</p> <p>I said, "Nope, not if you don't want to."</p> <p>"So what's your plan?"</p> <p>He looked at me and said, "You can say anything, little one."</p> <p>"I am your slave," I told her, "do you want me to serve you?"</p> <p>"Yes, little one. Do you want to serve me?"</p> <p>"Yes, Master. I want your little slave too."</p> <p>He picked up a small wooden box and he placed it on the ground on my Goddess's chest. "Do you know what this symbol is?"</p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
