"Oh, I don't know!" she cried. "You just don't know what else to do. Do you know where you're going with it? Should I give up?"</p> <p>I knew the answer as soon as I said it, but I didn't give it the time of day. There was no other way to say it so I took it. "If you would follow me to me bed, I know the best place is with the water."</p> <p>There seemed no other way. I got up from the bench and made for a chair. We talked until I could get it, and then we went down to the water. Once there I stripped, and she looked great in a pair of bikinis. She sat down and I kissed her gently. A few minutes later, my cock was hard and she smiled from ear to ear. It wasn't the first time we'd had sex before now, but it wasn't the first time I'd seen it.</p> <p>Our eyes were closed and I was breathing hard when she rolled me over on top. When we met in the middle our naked flesh pressed into each others and I felt the warmth of her. My cock throbbed into her and suddenly it was inside her. Before I knew it we were kissing again and I'm surprised she didn't just fuck right into me. When her breathing became harder and heavier, she was actually pushing up against me. I knew it was time, and she did not try, but she wanted it.</p> <p>"Do you always have to be so fucking aggressive, I mean, I hope you know it's just for sex."</p> <p>"Sometimes."</p> <p>"Is the sex all right?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I'll have to warn you about other women, not just your wife though. So you should be very careful here."</p> <p>I nodded, then closed my eyes again. We both got off again.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. You must never see this again," I said.</p> <p>"Don't worry. You won't be sorry, we're not the guilty party here. I still have other parts of you still to lose."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>We lay in bed, exhausted. Our bodies spent and completely satisfied. Even after all hours of our sex she'd taken my hardness. I don't really regret that. She was so damn beautiful, so desirable to me.</p> <p>It was only a matter of time before her mind began to wonder that our trip was too far and not worth the journey any longer. Before she realized it she drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>The next morning I woke up with a hard erection. It hadn't been all morning, but I had the most enjoyable memory of my trip so far.</p> <p>There were so many things I wanted to do for her. We didn't have time to do anything before our arrival. She had been so nervous, so very cautious, that she couldn't keep her eyes off of me the whole morning. I think she still thought about the first time she'd been with a woman, but then it really just happened, so why shouldn't she be? She was still worried about how to look at me and what to do with herself, so she'd been kind to not look at me in too much detail.</p> <p>We didn't have our shower time before we had to leave for the airport. Even though I was still hard, but not hard enough to get me erect she didn't try to get up. We stayed in bed for a half-hour before we were ready to get up and leave.</p> <p>"I just wanted to look at you again."</p> <p>She smiled. "So do I." She rolled over on her back and looked back at me.</p> <p>"You look beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you." She turned on her side, her hair out of the way. "Can we do this again?"</p> <p>"I don't know." I leaned over to kiss her, and when I pulled back she just smiled.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>After I got away from my apartment yesterday it was hard to stay there. I got a few jobs to pay bills and found I had to stay in a different apartment. I knew most of the things my wife worked at left little time for me.</p> <p>A couple days after that I had to get a new job at the shop while I also worked longer and longer hours. After awhile I had to return to work. This trip was going to take away everything my wife didn't even talk to me about.</p> <p>By the time I got to the bank my bank manager was happy about the job and let me back to work. My bank manager had seen his friend and told me I might be a little closer to retirement than my previous bank status was.</p> <p>We all enjoyed our visit and even wentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
