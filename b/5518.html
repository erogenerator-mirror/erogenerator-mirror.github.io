The pain was sharp and hot and hot and hot. I could feel it coursing through me and into me. All the power I'd had in the last year had left me. Her fingers were digging into my chest. She was yelling now.</p> <p>"Take me! Take me NOW! PLEASE!"</p> <p>And it was, without hesitation, she had.</p> <p>This time her first thrust was deeper, harder, deeper. She cried out in ecstasy - louder than ever. And then, I felt her ass tighten on me, clenching once for each thrust, then relaxing as her orgasm began - with a shudder.</p> <p>"Oh, my love! So beautiful! So gorgeous! So beautiful!" she cried. The sound made me want to shout it out loud, to shout it out loudly. But I managed a low groan, barely audible, before I felt her cumming again.</p> <p>Her muscles seized on me like an octopus. I could feel it all around me. Her fingernails dug in my chest as her orgasm washed over her completely. I felt her pussy contracting around me. I felt a tremor. I felt the softness of her ass grip me, tighten me, draw me closer. Her juices were everywhere! My cock was pressed right up against her belly, but she just continued to squeeze and release me - her pussy still pulsing on my cock.</p> <p>When her breathing slowed, her arms dropped and we began to part. She hugged herself to me, still breathing heavy, as she kissed the top of my head. I felt like I was in a dream, surrounded and surrounded by her warmth.</p> <p>She turned and looked at me with those beautiful eyes. "Is that better than a toy? You're still hard, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Just as we promised," I managed. "I still need more."</p> <p>She kissed my shoulders. "Of course you do."</p> <p>The two of us made languid rest on the bed, feeling as though there were days that we couldn't speak - or we wouldn't have believed it.</p> <p>+++++</p> <p>When I woke I was alone in the bed. She had a note, it said.</p> <p>"I have got to run. I'm late!" she said.</p> <p>We had an early start in the morning, so I had to go to my office before lunch. I took the train into the city and made short the next day's work. It was then that I noticed she was still in the same place, the same way, not in the same room, in the same bed, without the same covers. I walked up to the door and knocked.</p> <p>When she called out, "Go to the office," I was startled. The door was fully open and, as if she was naked, she was standing behind it. She looked a little nervous. Had she been naked in the kitchen before? Did she have company?</p> <p>"Sorry," she said. "I have to go." When she turned to me, she kissed me on the cheek. "I won't be back after the first morning."</p> <p>She smiled. "So much for being open with your secrets."</p> <p>And she was going to be more open at the office.</p> <p>"It's going to be great," she said.</p> <p>When I opened my mouth to say something, she whispered, "Later. I'm working the desk, not you."</p> <p>And my job wasn't exactly what I had intended on having.</p> <p>++++++++++++</p> <p>By lunch time, I had made my way over there from the airport to my office. My head was swimming. I had not been able to sleep. In less than an hour, a woman had dropped by, in the shape of a woman wearing a lab coat. It was a woman, but in a labcoat. She had taken off her coat again in her walk to my office. This one had a red lab coat over it.</p> <p>"Morning love", she said. "I've missed you!"</p> <p>And I'd missed her too.</p> <p>"What's all this "work" stuff, the labcoat" stuff?"</p> <p>"Oh just business" - I thought. "I'm trying not to be too long. The lab coat's all gone."</p> <p>"You just put your clothes back on, love," she said.</p> <p>"Yes I do. I just love them. I was just so anxious. You know. I've always been good with all that." She hugged me to her again. "I want to be with you. Always." She kissed my forehead and left the way she came.</p> <p>++++++++</p> <p>The next day was hell, but worth it as a chance to save my marriage, and maybeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
