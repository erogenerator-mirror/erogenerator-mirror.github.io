Don't make me do this! I just want to do it! It's so wrong!"</p> <p>"You don't have to say no to me, my pet."</p> <p>Her voice soft, full of arousal. I'd never heard her swear so loudly, my heart was in my throat. I felt her eyes taking on a life of their own. I could see her soul searching, not just mine... but my own. "My pet..."</p> <p>"I want to... I want to do it... Please... make me do it! My... My... Myself!"</p> <p>She stood on her toes and then began pulling the plug out, pulling it out slowly, but only half way. The sight caused me to start squishing my face. She seemed to notice, her eyes never leaving the screen as she pulled it out completely. I was still in shock as she stepped back again and set up the table to lay it on top of the pillows. I could finally focus some sense into the room without being in a trance.</p> <p>Her demeanor changed once more. She knelt again and began pulling on the chains with some force. I could hear her breathing quicken, her movements becoming more purposeful. I looked over my shoulder and noticed she seemed to be staring down the entire length of the chair she was sitting on, a look I had never seen before. The only thing she wasn't interested in was the camera. Her fingers were caressing her clit, her legs spread wide. Her eyes stared at the computer screen she was leaning her head back against her thighs as she ran her fingers over her hard nipples. She moaned, the sound coming from her throat as she rubbed faster.</p> <p>Her eyes remained locked on the computer screen the whole time. Her hand moved faster as she worked her clit over as fast as it could move. She leaned forward and pressed her breasts into her hands as she masturbated, biting on her bottom lip as I saw her hips lift up into the air. "Make me... I need you..." she said almost pleadingly. She pulled the chain across my back, and then ran it down my hip as she stood up. I saw her mouth open and closed, her tongue hungrily licking her lips. She slid her fingers in and out, pushing the chain under the desk drawer as she moved them around her hips and down my torso, coming to meet the vibrator she had picked up.</p> <p>I could feel the moisture coming between her legs as her fingers worked the vibrator over my skin. The thought of it turned me on as I watched her work herself off watching her. "I want you." She said it huskily.</p> <p>I moved a hand to my pussy. I pushed two fingers in me, trying to take it as deep as I could. I wanted to be filled but there wasn't enough room around for my hips to reach it. I felt a drop of her saliva that ran down my middle as I pressed into her hole gently. I ran my fingers over her clit in my mouth and I tasted the flavor of her. She looked up at me as she did this. I nodded as she pulled the chain over and the vibrator against her clit. She began to pump it in and out, fucking herself slowly, the look in her eyes and that other look between her teeth. I was in heaven, watching her fingers work on her hard clit, I had no idea how she could take so much. I felt her pussy tighten on my fingers as I pushed the vibrator in as far as it could go. She pressed her body down onto my fingers as she began screaming her pleasure. The vibrator inside of her began to move in and out quickly and I could feel the sensation on my hand. She seemed to keep trying to take it out of her. She finally just pushed off my fingers as the waves of pleasure shot up through her body. She fell to the floor, the vibrator leaving her pussy as her body quivering.</p> <p>We lay there. I heard her breathing for a moment. I looked over and saw a thin film of sweat on her forehead. She just stared at me. I leaned down and we kissed, tenderly, exploring each others mouths. She moaned into my mouth then, and I knew she wanted more. She broke the kiss with a moan. "It's not very fair, I want you right here!" The room was spinning with her words, and as I turned around to look back at her again her body was leaning forward with hers on the edge of the chair. She had turned her head sideways. Her eyes were glassy. There was no way she could keep it from me. She looked so sweet. I was so hot too. My hands began to move and I could feel the tension in my skin as I moved my body down closer to her. "Take my clothes off," she said and I heard the commandâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
