He looked almost mid 40. He wasn't muscular, but neither one of us could have been a swimmer by any stretch. He was wearing a tan-coloured pair of shorts with the kind of tent his shorts are supposed to be about. There were also a pair of white socks and trainers on his feet. He gave me a look that I was unfamiliar with. He was looking down at the floor, and gestured to me.</p> <p>"She's a good girl" he said, "She's a good girl who likes the boys but doesn't ever expect to be good!" It took me a few seconds before it registered with me. "And you haven't been bad, have you? You know what she like?"</p> <p>I had heard that phrase a lot when I was a young teen. This man was going to do a lot for me to get me into bed, and what better way than to make me feel special for just a little while. He must've noticed my nervousness.</p> <p>"Come on," he said firmly, "Come and join us." I almost got carried away.</p> <p>I went in first. The other man followed me in and waited until I had made myself comfortable. He pulled my trainers off my feet, grabbed my handbag and took me to the spare bedroom. We lay on the bed together.</p> <p>"I think you'd better change then," he said.</p> <p>The other guy looked at me. "We'd better make a start now then," he said, "or I will put him to bed so he doesn't have to go to bed before we can get started." He turned his mind to my feet.</p> <p>"I'm not sure he'll be all right," he told us.</p> <p>He moved us until he was lying with his leg over mine.</p> <p>"It's my turn now, do you think you could help me get him up?" he asked, not looking at us.</p> <p>We both nodded. I moved down a little and positioned myself between his legs. My knees went round his hips and my face was near enough so I could reach his shorts. His shorts had a thin material over the crotch, so that when I went up, my nose touched the thin material. Once I worked the thin material down his leg, he began to squirm a little, but I knew what he wanted so I held him down so that as he lifted his leg to get his shorts off, a clear sign to the other guy. The other guy didn't try to stop me, but I think he did give us a glimpse of what was inside the shorts as I worked the wet material up and down his leg. He had his hand on my back, probably caressing my skin, and he also was rubbing his finger up and down my spine, making me tingle. I looked down at him and felt very self-conscious. Was I being touched by someone I didn't know?</p> <p>He was doing a lot, my bum was warm against his thigh, so I thought he wanted this experience to end.</p> <p>I looked up at him. He looked at me, nodded, and I did the thing that every teenage boy should do. I raised myself a little so that all his leg seemed to disappear, then I moved a little harder, to push the wet material up. He smiled up at me and kept holding me down until a little noise came from him that I couldn't quite make out. He let himself down gently, lay back and lifted his legs to get out of the shorts. He was not a big man, but he looked a bit chubby as well. His cock and balls were hanging down low. Not huge but it was a good size and a respectable size. I could probably have swallowed a beer from the amount of fluid covering it.</p> <p>I lay there for a minute trying to work out my reaction to what had just happened.</p> <p>"Thank you" he told me. He was probably in the middle of getting his shorts off. I just laid there and watched him. He had a very nice figure for an older man. He hadn't shaved for years, which helped me understand what he might have been a couple of years after my last boyfriend. I had also noticed the large patch of hair on his body which started about the same distance between his thighs as his back. He certainly wasn't a fat lad, nor did he look bad. He just moved slightly when he reached the bottom of his leg to the right.</p> <p>He had a sort of half frown on his face.</p> <p>"You OK?" I asked. He didn't answer.</p> <p>My mind had been racing with what he was like, what would be my reaction if it ever got here. For about a minute I thought I was going to pass this conversation off as something else, if he had aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
