He took hold of my thighs and thrust inside me. I cried out as he stretched me wide. He drove his hard cock into me with a force to the point of pain, pushing himself in as far as his hands would allow. Once his thick cock was embedded in me I began to cry anew. His hard body pressing on my back and arms hurt from the struggle I had become. He pulled his hands off of my thighs and slid his hands to my rear, spreading my cheeks wide. He leaned forward, his cock sliding into me inch by slow inch, burying his cock deep in me. I looked over my shoulder at him. His eyes were hooded with lust as he watched us as he fucked me. I watched his hands slide down over his belly and disappear underneath the band of his shorts.</p> <p>"Fuck me. Fuck me hard!" I cried out. As our eyes met he pulled his cock back far enough for me to feel it, the head throbbing as he pushed it back into me, his body trembling with the force of his thrust. I moaned and cried out as he fucked me. Our bodies shook and I felt the slickness of the inside of me increase with his pace. He reached up and flicked my nipple as he fucked me and I gasped with the sensation.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I cried out as he began to thrust again. My own body was screaming for more, needing more and more. I felt his body stiffen and he began to fill me again. My own body was convulsing and my hips were meeting his every thrust, pushing against him as he slammed himself into me. We were both gasping for air as our bodies came together, our hearts racing and our bodies shaking with each thrust. He groaned low and deep and began to pound me at a furious pace. I felt as if he was coming inside me. The pleasure he had evoked inside me was so much greater than the pleasure he had already done to me.</p> <p>When his body twitched and his thrusting became more fierce, I knew he was as ready as I was to be taken. Even with my fear of heights beyond my control, I could feel myself beginning to slip from one of my own pleasure, a need that had built up as my body began to shake with the effort to cum. I was trying to scream. He groaned and shuddered inside me, sending another surge of pleasure up into my body just as his shaft exploded into me, emptying his cum. He groaned as my body convulsed as he filled me with his hot, thick gooey semen. I cried out, the cries of orgasm growing in intensity with each passing second, while the cries of pleasure grew louder.</p> <p>He pressed himself on me, pressing his stiff cock in and out from my body. Each time he had to push against me, he would press on me just as hard, driving his tongue into my mouth. I could feel his heart beating as it raced inside me through his cock, and I knew he was climaxing again. I could feel his body tremble and he groaned softly, holding me close, his hands over my body. I felt him pull his cock from me. I felt the slickness on the tip of his cock which I felt as he slowly pulled up the shorts I had been wearing. His cock head popped from me as he looked at me with lust in his eyes while his hand slid up my body slowly until he could cup my breast, tweaking my nipple. I felt the excitement of his touch as he pressed his mouth over mine and we kissed once, his hand leaving my breast and returning to its place.</p> <p>He was pressing my shoulders down as he kissed me. I felt his hardness, throbbing in his pants as we kissed, and I felt like I could cum again. My body rocked with each wave of pleasure. He slowly pulled away as his tongue came into contact with mine and I pressed my lips to his. He sucked the juices of my pussy from my lips and I felt the tingle in my stomach and in my legs. His hand wrapped around me and he pulled me against him, holding me close. He began to kiss me over my shoulder and down my neck, sucking a little at the soft skin, my hair tickling his lips. I moved to kiss him, and he kissed me back, our lips wetly locked. Our tongues met and danced. My legs were trembling when he pulled me to him and pulled, sliding me onto his cock. I wrapped my arms around his neck as he started to move inside me. His hands moved over my hips and sides, his kisses wetning my skin with each wave of pleasure he was causing within me. My body was reacting as I was. He pulled me to him and I pushed my hips up to meet him. I pushed against his cock with everything I knewâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
