He flinched at first, almost as if I were being tickled by invisible hands, and yet then relaxed. With each breath, I was drawn farther and farther into his subconscious.</p> <p>I pulled down on his hair, then back up, as far as I had gone. His mouth opened to admit my kiss and soon our tongues were dueling.</p> <p>His hands went to my waist, and he tugged on it, pulling me closer to his very masculine form. My tits were only a few inches beyond his face and my hardening nipples were just inches shy of his lips. I pulled my shirt up and over my head. I had left a short, dark red bra on this morning and I could see his eyes as he watched me take it off. His hands roamed over my bra, but not without feeling the smooth skin of my breasts. I didn't know if Eric had ever touched them before, not even in the shower.</p> <p>Now I just stood before him, his erection was pressing up against my stomach. I moved a hand down towards it and found it soft and smooth beneath my fingers. I stroked his cock for a couple seconds, and he moaned softly. This was more than I had ever been able to do or say. It felt as if I might come right there on purpose. I just hoped he didn't mind.</p> <p>His hands were at my waist again, now holding my ass. They pulled me closer to him and the only words that might have escaped Eric's lips, for he still had work left.</p> <p>"Oh fuck... baby..." His voice was low and full of passion. "God, baby, I've never been with a woman who wants to get my cock into her pussy so bad..."</p> <p>I turned around on shaky legs and took his hand in mine. I led him by pulling on the hem of his t-shirt. I slowly pulled it up, along with his pants, exposing his muscular chest. I didn't look down as a pair of strong and muscular arms encircled me. He pulled the shirt up and over my head, and with one last lingering kiss, I tossed the ruined t-shirt on the floor beside him.</p> <p>I stepped back up to him and took his head in my hands. I felt the hair of his chest against my stomach and pulled him on as my kisses took him further down. As soon as his lips touched mine, my hand went between us and pulled his head down. His hands were on my ass, gently squeezing and kneading. His lips pressed hard against mine and our tongues met. My arms were around him, holding him to me.</p> <p>He broke the kiss just long enough to pull his hands off my ass and then slid them up my thigh, then under my skirt. His long fingers felt the heat of my pussy through the thin material of my panties, and he traced the damp lips of my pussy.</p> <p>"You're not wearing any panties, are you?" I purred, my arms wrapping around him in my arms again. "I've got an idea. I want you to eat my pussy like the man who fucked me a while ago."</p> <p>"Well, you sure can," he whispered into my ear, one hand sliding up my side to cup one of my tits. He sucked on my lobe, his tongue swirling around the sensitive part that protruded from my body.</p> <p>He pulled my panties down and began his mouth kissing, licking, and sucking my pussy. He kissed the wetness of my lips, first one side then the other and eventually buried his face in my pussy's center. He had never kissed me down there. He had only found me first time, and my sweet little cunt was his and anyone else's. It was a moment of absolute ecstasy for both of us.</p> <p>I felt his tongue enter me, probing and seeking. I loved the touch, the taste, and he was driving me crazy with his skill. I could barely keep still, and started lifting my hips off the bed as I felt his tongue probing deeper. God, my orgasms had really built since Eric had fucked me a few minutes ago. They felt as though I had been fucked forever. But this was so much better.</p> <p>My clit had never been stimulated so well by a cock before. I felt him press hard into my flesh each time my body contracted around him.</p> <p>"Oh, baby... you're going to make me come....!" was all that would escape my mouth.</p> <p>He slid his cock back into me and began to fuck me with such abandon, that I thought I would come again right then. His hands were on me, holding me to him. He fucked me as hard as he could, fucking me and teasing my pussy. I felt as though there were no limits.</p> <p>A finger found my buttonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
