Maybe we can stay a little longer, in order to get going again."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry to say that, you might just have found a new home, young lady!" I added hastily, "But I hope we'll have the chance sometime soon," and I giggled.</p> <p>Then as she stood up, she reached for another beer and said:</p> <p>"I think I'll have another one of those."</p> <p>"You got an idea you could use more," I said and looked at her for a moment.</p> <p>"Thank you, dear, you're very sweet," she said, "And I'm sure you will be very happy with what you've got!" and she laughed.</p> <p>"I'd sure like to hear them both again," I said, making a beeline for the door.</p> <p>"Oh well," she said in a teasing voice, looking back at me with her smirk, "You're going for it for sure," and she laughed as the door closed behind us."</p> <p>"We've got to go now," I told her, "It's a long and uncomfortable journey."</p> <p>She gave me a quick hug and then said, "Okay, see you around!" after which she opened the door and stepped out into the hall.</p> <p>As I turned to go I was just about to say something to Mum when the front door opened and I caught sight of her. She was dressed in a very short black dress, a pair of black heels and some very elegant, feminine perfume!</p> <p>What she didn't notice my eyes were on her feet as she walked slowly toward the end of the corridor, which meant that I had time to admire the beauty of this stunning creature before me – she had already made a small fortune selling herself as a woman!</p> <p>As she stopped in front of me and leaned down for an embrace, I felt my cock twitch and my heart skip a beat. I leaned up to kiss her once more on the lips but before I could take any more she whispered:</p> <p>"Stay still, it's okay and I'll see if I can help it!"</p> <p>I nodded and looked at her again, waiting for her to give in until we were both just beyond walking distance and that we were about five-feet away from the rest of the world.</p> <p>She looked into my eyes and smiled. "It's okay, darling, I couldn't do it without you."</p> <p>And with that she ran both hands through the hair on my cheek and turned my face to her. Our lips were suddenly locked together only just a fraction of an inch apart. Her kiss seemed to start somewhere inside me, I was sure of it, and I knew that we had the opportunity for a lot of very, very many things.</p> <p>And as her tongue danced gently with mine, my hands gently wandered about her body, and the back of my hands almost unconsciously reached and found her breasts through the thin cloth of her dress.</p> <p>We were both breathing very heavily as the feeling of my fingers caressing her breast was almost more than I could bear. And as she kissed me more urgently I could feel the soft texture of her lips against my lips and my tongue caressed hers.</p> <p>All the time we were doing this, I felt her hand reaching under my towel, cupping my cock. She pressed her hand into my stomach and it felt as hard as it had ever felt and it grew to its full size as she massaged it up and down.</p> <p>"Ooooh, that's lovely!" she said softly, "But it might be a bit, too much... Oh."</p> <p>I was hardly in control and tried to hold still to stop her hands as it went further up my stomach but as soon as I relaxed I reached down and lifted her up a little.</p> <p>"No, no, no," she gasped, "It's really nice."</p> <p>A few minutes later mum had unbuttoned her dress, slipped it off, and turned around to face me once more, then she took off her strapless bra and threw it away, letting her small breasts fall out, and it was a moment too until our mouths were once again locked on one another in a hot mutual embrace.</p> <p>Again I found myself on the point of cumming – her tongue and mine were both sopping wet – as she sucked my tongue into her mouth. And then for a few seconds I felt her hand at the base of my cock, gently massaging my balls as my other hand started to caress her buttocks all over her body.</p> <p>"There's a bit more I'd like", I told her, "But there were a lot more I still wanted to do. I have to go."</p> <p>"Oh, don't rush me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
