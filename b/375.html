His skin was cool and smooth, and I enjoyed his skin. My hand crept down to his belly. He was very thin, and unlike most of the other women I had seen, had a belly. I ran my finger around his navel, tracing circles around it, and he inhaled deeply. I moved my finger down lower to his belt and then his jeans, stroking his cock, before pulling down his waistband. He broke away from me and pulled off a rubber, and I saw a little pre-cum, and as he handed me the rubber he put it inside the wrapper.</p> <p>He turned and bent over, and as he did, I slid the rubber off his cock and up his leg, then ran my hand up his bare back and over his ass, then down his thighs and legs. He lay on the bed, and I turned him around, sliding in beside him without the rubber. As I slid in, he put his arms around me, pushing his butt against my cock as he moaned. I didn't move as I kissed him, pulling his ear to my lips so I could taste his sweat on his body, and then I moved my arm through his chest as he rolled over, and as I slid down his body, I reached over to turn off the tube of KY. I licked my fingers clean and as before, as sheathed in lubricant, he reached over and unclasped my corset, kissing his way from the base of the corset to my chest, rubbing his hands together as my nipples felt soft. As I felt the rubber slide over my hands, sliding over his cock, I was reminded of when he had used KY on me after our lovemaking, and I pushed my corset off as he rolled on top of me again, moving as he entered me and moved inside me.</p> <p>I felt the warmth of his body as he began to move inside me, and as my breath caught, I knew that our bodies would merge as one as he moved, and I arched into him, letting them both enjoy the pleasure I was offering him. He began to move, thrusting deeply into me a couple of times before I felt his body begin to tremble, and with a last gasp of pleasure, we collapsed onto the bed. I reached under to rub his nipples a little, and he groaned his delight as I felt his cock twitching. He rolled onto his side with his arms around me, taking the weight on top and pulling me tight against him, whispering my name as if to remind me of him. I began to laugh softly as though it were a bad joke, then he moved my lower lip gently between his teeth and kissed me.</p> <p>"We're not done are we?" he asked between breaths. "We're not done."</p> <p>He rolled me over, pushing me back onto the bed, and I watched him as he rolled our legs around and straddled my stomach, with his knees on the bed and mine near his thighs. I was in love with his hairless body, and as his cock entered me, I couldn't help but watch his cock as it moved inside me as his head poked at my ass. I felt the wetness of his cum as his cock slid into me, and as he reached forward to put his hands flat on my ass, moving his tongue across my lips, he pulled back a bit, his hands now on my ass, massaging my cheeks, and as he felt my cock growing inside him, I knew that our moment would come soon enough.</p> <p>I pulled his head down towards my cock, and as he took my length into his mouth, I felt his pubic hair as he sucked me in tightly, his lips touching my cock at the base as he slid his lips up and down, massaging me between his teeth, sliding his tongue around my tip when I began to move my hips. He moved his head up and down, his soft hair matted against my cock, and as he felt my cock begin to swell again, he wrapped both hands around my balls and began to work them, pulling me to meet his rhythm as he sucked at the tip of my cock, rubbing his palm against my perineum as he moved up and down the length of me, flicking his tongue against my tip as he slid into me, then moving his face back and forth, as the vibrations of his voice, and the pressure of his thumb on my perineum, began to make me come and it wasn't long before we were both coming, and he began to suck on me harder as his own orgasm took over, and as the waves of pleasure took over he stopped and pulled off of me, leaning back as I was limp and satiated.
