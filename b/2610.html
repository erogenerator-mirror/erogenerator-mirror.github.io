"Where are we going?" Jake asked, his fingers digging into my thigh with his teeth.</p> <p>"I have to, to finish what I started," I said.</p> <p>"No, let's put on a show," Jake said, his fingers moving up my legs until he reached my panty covered pussy. I reached down and pulled my panties aside and lifted my leg so he could get his fingers through the hole before he inserted them inside me. It was my first encounter with a penis. Jake's fingers were a mixture of two liquids before their first contact. I felt myself getting wet as Jake explored me, pushing into me until he was in my pussy. Then he started the rhythm we found on the dance floor and the rhythm I liked as a kid. I loved it. I had never felt anything like it. It was as if I could feel his fingers moving into me, his breath on my neck as he moved in me, his hips moving against mine, and then all of a sudden, I felt his hips move as he started the rhythm.</p> <p>"What did you learn?" he asked, his hips moving forward, sliding his cock in and out of me. He moved in and out of me, going slightly deeper each time until he had bottomed out inside me. I could feel him swelling and pulsing within me. He had a hard time not pressing against me and making it to the point where he would stop altogether and stay moving inside me. Then out again to the point where he would just run out of me.</p> <p>"I didn't," I managed to say as he thrust into me again and again as the song came to an end.</p> <p>"I just wanted a little taste." Jake grinned at me then, his hands moving over my stomach to the top of my panties. "That's all, just a dance," he said.</p> <p>"Do you like this?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>I grabbed my panties and pulled them down, feeling them slide along my legs as I had to hold my breath. His hand moved down to my pussy again. He rubbed the bare skin of my cunt with his thumb, moving it up and down to tease me. I wanted to grab it and move it away and fuck on it but then I remembered what he liked, the feeling of him pressing against me, and I put it aside. I wanted his cock in me. I wanted it everywhere. I tried to push him off of me, but he caught my hand and pulled it back, holding my fingers to my lips.</p> <p>"Mmm, nice," he said, the tone of his voice betraying his excitement, but he didn't wait for a response. "I want another taste too."</p> <p>I was so wet that the sound of my wetness only added to the enjoyment of what was happening, but even more, the feeling of what he was doing. If I hadn't been so excited at what he was doing, I would have thought I was in danger of cuming. I was actually ready to cum, but he just kept on with the dancing. He was moving himself against me, holding me as he moved against me, his hands all over me wherever he could reach. I knew he would come in me. I knew he would come inside me and then he would be gone. He would have gotten up off me and left the floor and never come back. It was like that. He would take a step back from me and just walk away. I would be so close, so close I could feel his hot cum filling me.</p> <p>He leaned his forehead against mine, his eyes closed. Then he reached out and put one wrist across my mouth. "Keep watching me," he whispered. "You are so beautiful. I want to do this again and again."</p> <p>His finger touched me there and I tensed. "Jake, please," I whispered, afraid he was going to stop me, to hold me and not stop himself. How could I stop him from wanting me? I knew I couldn't. It was wrong, and yet at the same time, it was the most exhilarating thing I'd ever done, and here I was thinking it was my body that held him over, watching, feeling it.</p> <p>It wasn't long before he turned me over again and lifted my skirt and my panties off and his face, his breath, his words, his touch making me weak, and yet it wasn't long before my legs were open to him again, and my hand reached out and took his tongue and he licked my clit gently from below, from hole to slit until he found it and rubbed it, tasting it. He licked my pussy from one end to the other, back and forth, over and over again, his tongue touching me from every angle. I had never had anyone do something like this. I thought he was so sexy and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
