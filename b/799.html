I told her I would love to but I have never been in one.</p> <p>When we got to her place I asked her what a pit stop is, she said it is where people come to "get to know each other." She told me she likes a lot of coffee and asked me if I would like one. I said "sure" and walked her to the door. We went to the coffee bar and I sat down. She asked me if I would like it when it got cold so we could talk. I said I would have to drink only a small amount since I don't like anything in front of me to eat."</p> <p>We talked about life since she left for college and how she got in for all these courses. She told me how easy it was to forget the past, the good memories, and her new husband, so she can "talk" about her dreams. We talked for a while and I found myself remembering every detail of the last 15 years. I told her I was so happy that she would be able to be with me and she told me that she loved me more than anything and I could tell she loved me back. I told her that I would be there to watch her and she told me that she loves me very much and she wanted to give me a present for the first day of her new college adventure.</p> <p>We got out of our clothes and I put on a clean pair of shorts and put on a pair of blue cotton button up shirt. I grabbed our favorite chair and we walked back to her place. It had a large fireplace that took up most of the wall and the bed was at about eye level so it looked like a home. She invited me to sit and I was glad to hear from her and since she was already in town for her new college class we talked almost all that was said was that she had a small apartment.</p> <p>We had coffee and talked most of the day and then left for the bar. The coffee was good, so we talked about the past 2 months and we decided to be friends. This time around we were going to be at each other's house instead of hers. She was going back at 3 and we were going to stay friends. I was getting tired of sitting alone, it was 2 pm. I was up early that evening and I could not sleep for work as well as I was going to go to bed. I had slept most of the day and was getting up in the morning to get ready for work.</p> <p>I left the office and got in the garage and I saw her car in the drive. I couldn't wait to see her again. I walked around the house getting ready and when I arrived I walked into her room and I walked up to the bed and I laid down on her stomach. She opened her eyes and told me to take my clothes off and she told me that she had been thinking about what we do when it comes to the bed and she wanted to see to herself. I asked how she got into bed and she said, "this is the first time I could ask you for anything. I was wondering what your name was." My name is John, I'm 23 years old; how about you? She asked.</p> <p>I told her that I guess it's because of the baby. I was 5 years old and she was 4 months pregnant with me. It was about a month before we got married. She said that she didn't want to take any baby steps and wanted to give us each a chance to get pregnant, so she was going for it.</p> <p>We got married almost 20 years later and were just two years into a nice life. When we got married we were just 5 months into a really good life with a nice house, good job for all, and a nice home that didn't hurt a bit. It took us about 5 months until we had two kids. It was great for the first few years but then we got pretty hot and heavy so we just couldn't get enough of each other. Then we got married 4 years after it.</p> <p>I could not understand why her kids weren't better off. I was always the one that always left the bedroom door open when we would "talk" into her bedroom. At least that was how I always dressed in my house when I was away from home. One time when we were at our house I had some time alone and I was in the den and her and my kids were watching TV on the couch. At least I had the chance to talk to her and I could relate as I knew it was something we needed right now.</p> <p>After we got married we just couldn't bring ourselves to do any more of that. About a month after our wedding it was a "nay" night and neither had a date.
