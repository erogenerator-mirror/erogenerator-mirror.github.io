The smile returned as her eyes went straight to his cock. She wrapped her thumb around the shaft of his cock. Her mouth dropped open at what her eyes were seeing.</p> <p>He leaned his head back and moaned as she started to slowly stroke his cock with her thumb. She kept going until she was able to take in half of it as she rubbed her thumb around the base of his cock. Her eyes went back to his face and saw that he seemed to be enjoying what she was doing.</p> <p>"Now it's my turn," she said with a smile.</p> <p>The she leaned her weight over the arm of the couch and reached inside her skirt.</p> <p>She parted her thighs just long enough for his hand to grasp her cunt through the fabric of her panties. She moved it up her thigh as she leaned over, pulling her skirt higher and higher until his hand slipped into her panties. Her thighs parted enough for his hand to slip underneath her panties as she slid her fingers to the tip of his cock.</p> <p>She guided his cock with both hands as she guided his hand along her panties. She felt his hand move to her cunt and felt it slide along the lips. She leaned toward him.</p> <p>"Feel your cock?"</p> <p>He nodded his head.</p> <p>"Can you feel your cock? Feel how wet it's made you?"</p> <p>Before he could answer, she brought his hand along her wet pussy, letting his fingers tease the slit. He felt something different but couldn't put a name to it.</p> <p>"You are a dirty talker, aren't you?" she joked, knowing that it was just a ploy to make him moan.</p> <p>His answer was simple enough.</p> <p>"You're a little slut. Use it!" was all he would have to say. He looked over at her with a confused, lust filled expression.</p> <p>She smiled at his reaction and lowered herself on his cock. She sat down so both of his hands were now under her legs. His hands were now under her skirt and he had the same hands in her panties. She closed her eyes so that she could feel his hands touch her pussy.</p> <p>As she felt his fingers slip under her panties, she felt another sensation. She felt her cunt open up and slide down a bit more. He looked over to get a look at her reaction. She smiled back at him as she spread her legs to allow him to push himself into her. Her eyes opened slightly as a small smile and some light licking of her lips and parted lips broke the spell.</p> <p>She rocked back and forth against his cock a bit faster so that he couldn't move. She kept her eyes closed until she felt his fingers pressing against her. Her eyes still closed at the sensation. She felt his fingers slide against her as a finger slipped back into her.</p> <p>He felt her cunt grab at his fingers as he started to fuck her. He felt her grip on his cock increase as his finger slipped into her. Her eyes closed again as she moaned, "Oh yes!"</p> <p>The more he fucked her, the harder she pushed against his cock, and the louder she moaned, "Ohh baby! Oh yes!" It was enough for him as he felt the tingles start to go all over his body.</p> <p>She moaned again as his finger slipped back into her and he pulled his cock out of her panties. He pushed himself inside of her and as he started to speed up, so did she. He was now pounding her pussy. Her thighs slapped against his and her toes moved about. He looked down at her as he slammed into her.</p> <p>They moaned, they talked and they enjoyed the feel of each other. Her mouth opened but no words were coming out. She looked over at him with her mouth hanging open. Her eyes still closed, she kept a smile on her face.</p> <p>He saw the signs of coming and she knew it. He grabbed her shoulders as he exploded inside of her. All that hot feeling went right to her pussy. As the pleasure came, she closed her eyes again.</p> <p>As he pulled out of her, he looked down at her and thought to himself that this was going to be the first one ever. Her smile still on her face she let her mouth hang open for a second then closed it again as a tear rolled down one eye. She looked so vulnerable on the couch as both the pain and pleasure coursed through her body.</p> <p>As they looked at each other, there was a smile of a satisfied smile on her face.</p> <p>"Thank you, Mr. Robinson," she said, her eyes looking up at him.</p> <p>"My pleasure, Ms. Walker," he said just before he kissed her once more.<|endoftext|â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
