I really need this."</p> <p>"You're sure?" I asked, almost in awe of his prowess.</p> <p>"Of course I am," he says, looking down at me. I stare into his eyes and he smiles.</p> <p>I lay down and he climbs between my legs and begins to lick the underside. I moan and writhe in his arms.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?" he asks, his lips caressing the undersides of my breasts and slowly working down, over and around the nipple.</p> <p>"Oh fuck! Yes!"</p> <p>He takes that as a yes and starts to nibble on the other one.</p> <p>"Good! That feels so nice! Yes, suck my nipples!"</p> <p>I squeal in delight.</p> <p>"I need you," I say, pushing him onto his back.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, I'm ready and I climb on top of him.</p> <p>"Ready?" I ask, giving him head.</p> <p>"Now!" he yells, thrusting his hard cock deep into me.</p> <p>He grabs my ass and starts to fuck me, moving in and out of me. I'm so turned on that I nearly have mini orgasms.</p> <p>"Fuck yes. Fuck yes. I'm fucking coming!"</p> <p>I lean forward and kiss him. He turns my body towards him and begins to lick my breast. "I can't get over how good this feels," he says as we kiss. "It's like a dream come true for me."</p> <p></p> <p>We lay there, exhausted, kissing and enjoying the physical sensation. I'm almost out of breath when he breaks the kiss. "Shower? And now?"</p> <p>"Sure," I say, "but I can't wait to get my bath and change." I give him a sly grin and say, "If we're going to be together, you need a bath."</p> <p>He laughs and starts to turn me over as we laugh. We get out and shower. Afterwards, we get dressed and I go to see about breakfast. I walk back from the bedroom, dressed in my silk robe. My breasts are barely covered, and my pussy is shaved bare except for a thin strip of hair on top.</p> <p>"Hurry! Please!" I call out at the doorway. I get a brief, but very sexy look and a naughty smile.</p> <p>The door shuts with a bang and I'm on my way.</p> <p>As I open the front door, a look of disgust comes over my face.</p> <p>I'm glad the front door was locked, or else I'd have been left wondering what happened in here.</p> <p>I walk inside and see a young man sitting there.</p> <p>"Hello to you my dears," he says, smiling. We exchange quick, nervous nods of assent.</p> <p>"I hope I didn't embarrass you," I say, stepping towards him.</p> <p>"It wasn't too bad," he says, rubbing his palm over my hand, running it lightly over my cheek.</p> <p>"Well, I don't know if I can thank you for your hospitality. You have a lot to learn." I pause, enjoying the moment.</p> <p>"My name is Kari," he says, extending his hand.</p> <p>Before I can respond, my hand is being taken and I'm led to another room, this one, a bathroom and a bath. The young man in the doorway is smiling at me.</p> <p>"Don't you want me to bath you?" he asks.</p> <p>"I don't think I can," I say and he gives me a look.</p> <p>"I can't believe I just did that!"</p> <p>"I didn't do anything," I say defensively, "but thank you. That was nice of you."</p> <p>He chuckles and walks towards the bath. "Just don't forget to give me a quick blowjob!"</p> <p>"Kari will do that for me, just let me know when."</p> <p>"We'll see," I say, and we're off to another room and into another. This one is a huge bath. There's a Jacuzzi, a waterfall, and there's an oversized recliner, and you can take them anywhere.</p> <p>"I'm going to take a shower now," I say as I take a long, luxurious shower.</p> <p>I put on my robe and walk out to the bath. I walk around and sit in the bath, trying to ignore the looks of disgust from the young guys. I turn off the water, get out and go to the door, pulling it closed with trembling fingers.</p> <p>"Come on.
