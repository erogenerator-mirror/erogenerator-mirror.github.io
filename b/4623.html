"I thought you liked me? It's all good when they have a good time."</p> <p>With that last statement her hand snaked out and she was going to touch the side of my face. As her finger grazed the tip of my beard, I felt one of her fingers slide under my chin and onto my lips.</p> <p>"I know it looks bad and kind of gross," she said as she closed her hand around my face. "But look what you've done now. What could be in your mind that is so bad that can be good?</p> <p>As my lips were parted she started kissing my lips. She pushed her tongue against my lips to meet mine.</p> <p>"I guess I really do like you," she said. "Now kiss the things they make you do. Feel their hardness. Feel my pleasure as they press against you. Feel it grow. Feel the life force of your life come alive under your body. Feel a beautiful thing coming out of your chest as you feel the life flow through your body."</p> <p>As she spoke she had undone her blouse; opening it so that the bra strap fell open.</p> <p>"Do you like me?" she asked as my hands reached out to cup her breasts.</p> <p>"Oh, oh yes," she sighed.</p> <p>I pushed her bra straps so that she was just barely covered; her nipples pointing straight out. I squeezed her breasts gently and she cooed at my touch.</p> <p>We broke our kiss, and she moved to the side of her car. She pulled the hem of her skirt up, revealing the lower portion of her thigh and her black satin panties. She reached out and grasped my erection through shorts.</p> <p>"Will this help you?" she asked as she ran her hand up and down the shaft.</p> <p>She pulled her panties aside, and I could see the moisture coating the smoothness of her lips; just the hint of her inner folds was enough. She held the base of my erection with one hand and moved her mouth to my balls with the intention of kissing them. Her lips brushed from the base of my cock to her face as she kissed the shaft.</p> <p>A thrill came racing though my body as I felt her tongue run along the crown of my cock. I moaned as the soft heat of her mouth engulfed me.</p> <p>She sucked me, and I felt her tongue slide around the crown of my cock. "Oh, baby, you are so good," she cooed.</p> <p>She sucked on me for some time, and I thought I was going to get off there.</p> <p>"I love it when she does that," she said. "Sometimes I can go on for hours with a mouthful of spit and cum." she said.</p> <p>"It feels good," I said, "but it doesn't feel good enough, and this time it's just for you. She's making love to me with her mouth and lips."</p> <p>"God," I said. "Will it turn you on hearing my voice in your ear?"</p> <p>She laughed. "God yes, baby, it would."</p> <p>"Do you think it would make me so wet you will find it impossible to wait until you get your own."</p> <p>I pushed up against her, feeling her push back against me. I could feel the heat of her loins pressing against me as she rubbed herself against me. "Oh, honey we're right here. I think I'm going to cum."</p> <p>I moved around and pushed her off of me and to her feet. I kissed her and then turned her around to face me.</p> <p>"Do what you do best, don't just stand there," she said. "I want you."</p> <p>She grabbed my shorts and unzipped them, releasing my cock. She took me in her hand and slowly stroked me, squeezing lightly. I watched as she ran her hand up the shaft, and then back down. I grabbed tightly my penis with my hand and ran my hand up her thigh. I felt her shiver as I got closer to her center. I heard, "Mmm, oh baby, you feel so good in my hand"</p> <p>I cupped her breasts and gently pinched her nipples before sliding them back and forth. I felt her shudder. My hand slid to her stomach and dipped lower. My fingers ran down over her navel and I felt the rise and fall of her hips with each pass of her thighs. I felt her hips rise as I knelt as she slid to the carpet. I looked up and her head had fallen back as I lowered my head and began to kiss and lick her breasts.
