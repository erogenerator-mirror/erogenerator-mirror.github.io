We'll see." He then pulled me close and gave me a gentle squeeze before they pulled our clothes back. They then walked us from the cabin over to the shower, making sure we were dry just long enough for them to dry us off.</p> <p>"Hey, don't do this." He took both of us into his arms like he was going to take a rock to kiss me but held back for more important things.</p> <p>"Don't even try." I told him as I started to pull off his shirt, my eyes never left his. "You're perfect."</p> <p>"Yeah, you're exactly that, but I'll have to leave this room for a few more clothes." He whispered as he took off my pants, leaving me standing naked before them in their bedroom.</p> <p>"I'll have to try not to make anyone else jealous." He said as he kissed me.</p> <p>"Maybe I'll keep you from having that." He said as he took off his shirt and threw it to me. "You do this to me." He said as he took me into his arms and we kissed passionately.</p> <p>He was still dressed as we left the room, I knew we couldn't wait to see what awaited after they left us naked together but I didn't care.</p> <p>"Hey you." He said as if I was crazy. "That was quick. You'll need more clothes soon."</p> <p>"Nah. That was soooooo good."</p> <p>We kissed for what seemed like forever, neither of us knew what to do or say. I wanted to tell him that I loved him. However, I knew I couldn't do that. My pussy was so hot and tight I didn't want him to cum inside me, or have him try to have intercourse with me. He didn't seem to notice either, but he took off his clothes, pulled me close once more, and gave me the most serious look I had ever seen in my life.</p> <p>He took me in his arms once again and kissed me again, this time he used his tongue to tease my bottom lip and tease my top one. I could finally feel his manhood pressing against my body and his tongue was doing wonderful things for my taste buds. I wanted to tell him to take his damn clothes off but I wanted to keep him in my bed. I wasn't sure if he had some kind of religious objection to me showing off in my room, I had been the recipient of many a naughty boy's private peepshow and had been a very willing student.</p> <p>Once I was completely naked he pressed his lips to mine again, making me weak in the knees. His lips were strong and soft, he kissed me deeply and made me feel like I should be feeling every kiss I got. I wanted to move against him, to feel his hardness in my body, but I wanted this to continue. I needed him again, soon.</p> <p>When his lips left mine he looked into my eyes for a long time. I could feel him staring at me like he were lost in the night, only to have his eyes turn back to the spot he had just kissed. I knew I had to do something to make him feel good because he was feeling bad.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, but that kiss is always the best." He whispered as he kissed me again, his lips moving back and forth, his mouth opening even more, his breath even more intense. "The way you kissed me was like heaven, you made me feel so amazing!"</p> <p>I know it was only a matter of a long time. His face was flushed when I broke the kiss and I saw his face was flushed a little too.</p> <p>"Did you want to be better?"</p> <p>"Yesssss."</p> <p>"Well, you can do the rest! I think one more kiss will make everyone happy."</p> <p>After I kissed him again I reached down between his legs and I felt for his erection which was as hard as a rock. I touched him for the first time and ran my fingertip over the tip of his member. I loved how large that thing was, it must be at least 9 inches long and as thick as her thumb. I ran the tip of my finger around the head of his penis while I looked into his eyes. I wanted him to want me as much as he did. His eyes were still closed but I could feel him start to rock against me.</p> <p>"Oh, baby. Please." I said as I cupped his balls in one of my hands. I wanted him to feel good for himself, to be able to control the situation. "Let me help you, I promise I won't do anything that you'd do if it turned you on."</p> <p>The way he said 'baby' made me feel a little dirty, but he sounded just like a boy begging for hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
