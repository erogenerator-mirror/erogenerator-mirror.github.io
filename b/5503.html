I took on a pleading look and she looked down shyly. "Did you like what I just did?" I continued.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh God, it was wonderful. It was nice. Oh, God... it was beautiful" she replied, looking into our eyes.</p> <p>"Is it always this good?" I asked.</p> <p>She looked at me strangely. "Are you sure?" she said.</p> <p>"Sometimes," I said. "It depends on your mood. You never have been better for me, but to be a good lover when all you need is that. You made me feel good; you know how that is for a guy. It's just nice to know... to be loved."</p> <p>"When you're not around..." she started.</p> <p>I cut her off mid-sentence. "You're a special girl, Laura. And you've made me a very happy man." I then leaned down and kissed her hard. As I did, my arm slowly rose and brushed against her breasts. She gasped as I rubbed the sensitive tip of my finger against her nipple and she gave an involuntary little wince. "Don't worry," I said as my hand moved lower. "It will all be ok."</p> <p>"Don't," I repeated, and I kissed her again. She seemed to come back, and we continued to kiss. I broke off the kiss and looked at her and smiled. My wife was blushing now and looking into our eyes.</p> <p>"You're wonderful, sweetie," I said. "And I enjoyed it very much. When I get my chance, I want all we can share together. Now take care of your husband and he'll be safe until you're ready."</p> <p>With that, I pulled my wife down and we again kissed. Her hand moved over me and stroked my cock. "Mmm... I love it when you do that," she told me.</p> <p>After a bit of this, Laura turned and we kissed again. Her hand moved down to my cock and she began to stroke it, making me groan. "Oh, God," I thought as she slowly massaged me with her hand. Then she lowered her face and took me into her hot, wet mouth, going balls-deep. I was completely taken away by my wife's expert mouth – and by what she was doing to me. Her tongue moved over and around me, swirling around the head of my cock inside her hot, wet mouth. Slowly, she moved her mouth down me, taking my cock completely into her mouth. I moaned and held her head.</p> <p>I watched her hand as it moved up and down my shaft – my wife's hands gently caressing my balls. She had always been able to deep-throat me – I had always told her to go down as far as she could and take the entire shaft down her throat, but she had never done it. She continued to suck as she moved up my length. I watched as she closed and reopened her mouth, taking my cock into her mouth once again.</p> <p>"Oh," I moaned, "Oh, God, yeah.."</p> <p>I watched as my wife kept stroking my cock, taking it into her mouth and then drawing it out. She repeated this as she licked and sucked my balls, and then back. When she moved back up to the tip of my cock, she stopped momentarily, licked her lips, and then resumed sucking.</p> <p>I didn't really hear what she was saying. I was so caught up in watching this woman, as she got herself off, that I didn't really pay attention to anything at that point. But by then, the excitement of the situation was driving me nuts – I couldn't stop it. I was close and then suddenly I saw something in the corner of my eye. There was movement in the corner. The girl at the bar was walking toward us. She was naked, her breasts rising and falling.</p> <p>"Mmm, Laura! It's really nice to see you. Oh my God, do you know how sexy you look in that little red dress?" I heard him say as I watched her remove her top, revealing her tits. A look of shock crossed his face as his eyes devoured every bit I was seeing. "Oh no! Oh, Laura, that's not right. That's soooo sexy..." I was starting to understand.</p> <p>I looked past the girl at the door again, and I saw a tall man was standing behind her. He was holding her close to, and as he began kissing her neck, she let out a soft moan. He held her from behind very tightly, and my wife had her arms around her and had one hand on her naked breast, stroking it as she continued to lick and kiss his cock—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
