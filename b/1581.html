I could just imagine what the sensations that would feel like were going to feel like...</p> <p>I had to swallow to keep from moaning, but I heard him moan as his cock began squirting into my mouth, filling it with his cum. The sensation must have been as delicious as it was, as he groaned and kept spurting into my mouth as his fingers moved on my back and buttocks.</p> <p>I sucked and licked up and down his shaft, as he lay against my side, both of us breathing heavily. He finally pulled his cock from my mouth and a large glob of cum landed across my nose.</p> <p>"Good," he said, kissing me as he did, "I am glad that you were able to do this."</p> <p>"I'm glad that you did it as well... and I am glad that I get to taste it too," I said, my eyes twinkling in the stillness of the morning light, as I pushed his cock between my lips to show him something that had been bothering him all day.</p> <p>"You are not the first."</p> <p>I had to laugh at his joke, though, "No, I suppose not," I said. "It was a surprise a few moments ago."</p> <p>"So I see for it to be so....." he said, his words trailed off as he tried to decide what to say next.</p> <p>"Oh yes," I said, lifting my right hand and holding it out, "We are going to do this again."</p> <p>"Really?" he said, his expression and expression was incredulous.</p> <p>I laughed, "Oh yes," I said, "We will." Then I kissed him.</p> <p>He kissed me back. It was such a kiss, it made me feel so happy. He took my hand and we walked to our bedroom hand in hand. Then I turned to his, and our kisses were so passionate and intense that it was like being in a dream. When we had got out of bed, he lay on his stomach.</p> <p>"Why don't you sit on the bed now?" he said as he turned over and got up. I sat on him.</p> <p>Once I had lay back, which I did very soon, he was on all fours, so his face was looking over me. I was feeling very excited; a sense of anticipation was in the air, despite all that had gone on. I liked that it came back to me when he did this. I turned my head slightly to the side so that I could smell his scent, not just on my skin.</p> <p>"You smell like me, baby," he said to me as he looked back at me. There was a twinkle I hadn't quite noticed, as I looked over to see what it was. A little smile, but my interest was already starting to get aroused more. So, I opened up my lips as he had done. The smell of his cum, mixed with sweat, made it all that much more pleasant.</p> <p>I spread my legs a little for him as he moved over. Then I closed my eyes and waited, feeling him touch my pussy and explore my pussy lips and even the lips to make them more sensitive and moist as he slipped a finger slowly in.</p> <p>I felt him move up, his cock hard and throbbing as it pressed against my leg. My pussy was aching for some attention as it pressed back against him. Then, he had moved his body up and laid himself on the bed, his ass on a couple of pillows.</p> <p>"That's it baby," he said. "Shove that cock in me."</p> <p>"Is this what you like?" I said, my voice full of excitement.</p> <p>"If you want," he said, "just make sure that you take it slowly, so I can last.</p> <p>I got on it slowly and felt his cock slide in with smooth, slow ease. His cock was the best part, I knew. He made me feel as happy as he did.</p> <p>I began to move my hips, feeling the head of his cock moving back and forth along my clitoris, getting me excited all the more. Every movement made his cock jerk a little, which was exciting me, as he did with the feeling of my pussy's wetness. I liked feeling that.</p> <p>But more than that, as he said, he had been thinking it that I enjoyed his control.</p> <p>"Fuck me, David," I said, smiling into the pillow as I pushed my body into him, "fuck me and make me cumâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
