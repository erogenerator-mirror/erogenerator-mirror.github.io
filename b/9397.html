Don't get me wrong. He was nice, but he wasn't what I needed. I guess I need to make it more memorable, too," Heather responded.</p> <p>"Really? Can you do that?" I asked, with an amused grin. "You know, you could have at least tried some of it last night. I remember your reaction!"</p> <p>I had to laugh, as Heather got to her feet. "Oh, you were a real trooper, weren't you?" she quipped.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess maybe he got a little ahead of himself," I chuckled.</p> <p>"Yeah, he did. And when he came back a minute or two later...he was really hard...and when he left, I could see his cum...not just on the end of his cock. I think it was in his eyes," Heather explained.</p> <p>"Are you still trying to turn him on?" I asked, with a grin.</p> <p>"I've sure tried! I think it's kind of hot to have such a young stud come looking for a blowjob. It would be great for me to be just the last one in the hot tub!" she answered, a bit wistfully. Her voice had that edge to it that it can make someone who doesn't know all the right things.</p> <p>"Can I ask you what made you do it?" I asked cautiously, trying to gauge the reaction of Heather's mind and body.</p> <p>"Well, for one thing, he wasn't the shy type. But in my defense, my inhibitions, you know? He didn't put a condom on until after you left. If it hadn't gotten around to a quickie in your room, if you had been with another woman, I think I would have jumped his bones," Heather responded, with a giggle.</p> <p>"Wow, I had no idea...I think I remember that. I mean, that was so hot to me. After you got dressed, you gave him a kiss and got out of the tub, didn't you?" I admitted.</p> <p>"Well then, if I had known that you were about to go all the way, I would have made sure he was ready for that!" was all Heather spoke to me. It was a bit of a turn off, as it did not have anything to do with her.</p> <p>"Well, the other way he came wasn't as strong as that. I couldn't feel it in my pants. I mean, that doesn't have to be a turn on," Heather said, blushing red. Her face really reddened, even more now. "But..."</p> <p>"Yes?" I prompted, putting an emphasis on the word "your."</p> <p>"He was so turned on that I had to have him. I think I made my decision, he's all mine," she responded, with a grin. "You know, it's hard to describe how I went that night, but it is kind of easy to describe it. It felt like I needed to just let the feeling wash over me. A girl comes out of the bathroom and tells everyone she's having fun, and then has to go back to her room and go back to the room to change. The last one to get changed gets out of the tub and comes running down the hall. We're all going to get naked and we all have a good time!"</p> <p>"Let's get going," I said, trying to get the tension out of Heather's body.</p> <p>We walked back down to the table, and when I reached the table, I noticed that another round of drinks had been ordered.</p> <p>"I'm thinking," the waiter said to us as I pulled out the chair for Heather to sit, "that we've had enough 'breakfasts.' What do you say? We don't leave the bar alone for another hour if we want to be the first ones here?"</p> <p>"I agree," Heather responded, with a wink. The waiter took our beers from us, and we all downed them in one go. We stood up, walked over to the dance floor, and found some dance music.</p> <p>It was really weird dancing there with Heather and the waiter, but at that point it did not really seem as bad as a normal routine.</p> <p>"So, you going to dance again this night, or are you going to keep the little dance of the night as a distraction?" the waiter asked, while pulling Heather toward him. Heather held onto his arm, and smiled as her eyes lingered on his hand.</p> <p>"I'm going to keep dancing as long as I possibly can; I'm not planning to stop until I can keep dancing!" Heather responded, as we all stood next to each other and danced our wayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
