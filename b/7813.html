They kissed more fervently, and their tongues explored as their hands caressed. She leaned closer - her lips against his neck. The kiss had made her excited. She needed this - this was her body.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and moved away, holding him in one hand. She was naked, and the scent of her had a heady smell of cleanliness, and was still feeling horny. He took in her body, and her smell became more pronounced - musky and pungent; she smelled like a pussy; and it was turning him on. She dropped his jacket onto the ground. The skirt she wore wasn't the sort he'd seen her wear at the bar; it was more of a halter like, the style like a dress shirt of some sort. He put his hands to the thin material and felt for the clasp of her breast, and with a shaking hand found it. It was still only partly her size - there was some that looked natural on her skin - a tiny bit of the soft white breast was showing, it had that soft pink shade. He ran his fingers over her nipple, and she gave a shudder.</p> <p>"Oohh.."</p> <p>She gave a low moan and he cupped her breast - gently squeezing and caressing gently. She began grinding her pelvis against his, and his erection grew, and she could feel it straining within his trousers - and she began to breath more heavily, and the smell of sex was stronger.</p> <p>"Kiss me - on the cheek....."</p> <p>She leaned in, and he took her in his arms. They kissed harder and more fervently, their mouths pressed against one another. He pulled down her T shirt, feeling her breasts pressed into his chest. She pushed her hands into his hair, and kissed him harder, pressing her hands between hers. He squeezed her buttocks - there was no denying the thrill of his hands rubbing over her body - and he slid his fingers between her labia...</p> <p>She was very wet and he could feel it. Her pussy was now gliding over his cock, sliding easily along its length as her arms pulled him to her. They were becoming aroused together - each wanting the other's body.</p> <p>A few moments later, he rolled on his back and she sat bolt upright on his chest. His cock was almost painfully erect, but he didn't care - her legs were wide open and the pussy lips on her thighs were glistening with wetness. They were like a ripe, swollen flower: pink and swollen; her clit was swollen and hard and pink - a perfect pearl. He wanted to suck it and drink it - he wanted to kiss it and lick it and bite it. He had fantasized about making love with a beautiful woman, she was very beautiful - and yet there were not a pair of legs on his face that he was trying to suck -</p> <p>She pushed his head back. It wasn't very hard, but not very gentle, and it became hard for him to breath even if he had his hands on her body. She grabbed his trousers and ripped them off, then threw them to the side. She moved so that he was kneeling, his cock at her entrance. She slowly, delicately, pushed forward, and her pussy parted - and he saw that her pussy lips had opened, and could feel the moist flesh of her engorged clit peep out. He wanted to lick her, but her hands were on his head and, as gently as he could, he took his lips off her nipples, kissed the little nub, and she went back to her knees in front of him. She pressed her pussy lips down upon his cock, and he could see it glistening wetly against the soft, blue material. It was hard as nails and he could not help taking it into his mouth - she tasted so good.</p> <p>He couldn't do much else, as he lay there, just letting her slide down - she was kissing his chest, breathing heavily as she kissed him, and then she was moving, moving down his body, kissing his stomach, licking his belly button, and finally he felt the swell of her pussy lips as they slid down his shaft and she moaned in pleasure at his hardness. She lifted her head, looking down and seeing how much he looked like a monster, and she moved to kiss his cock.</p> <p>Now, he was in for the shock of his life. She looked down at him - her head was raised and her eyes were fixed on his hard cock, with its swollen head, glistening with her wetness - and she licked her lips - slowly and teasingly. She leaned forward - her eyes never leaving his. She smiled, as she had always done, and slowly took his throbbing cock in her mouth, gently sucking, sliding her mouth up and down the shaftâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
