I answered, pushing myself up. It's amazing what your body can do. I stepped out of the tub and took a step back before walking over to the counter and grabbing my robe from the back of the door. As I wrapped the robe myself as she was out of the bathroom I heard a knock at the front door. I opened her door and a few moments later she breezed past as the door unlocked and locked behind her.</p> <p>"Good for you," she said as we entered the living room. There's a couch cushion on this side of the couch, and a table with a television on it. She picked up a small bottle of wine and poured us both a large glass each. "I'm ready for a good time," I told her as I closed the door. We sat down on the couch in front of the TV and listened to some movie we had. I was beginning to think that I had been lucky enough to have been sitting here watching an adult movie for the better part of an hour! She set the wine down at about 8 o'clock, and took a minute to take a leak before getting back into bed.</p> <p>"So, what's in the movie you were watching?" she asked, her mouth slightly agape.</p> <p>"It's pretty good, isn't it?" I answered, reaching for the remote. We had found the movie in the VCR.</p> <p>"How did you choose to find this movie?" she asked.</p> <p>"I got the one on 'Midnight' that you liked a lot," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I like the title," she said, leaning back on the pillows. I turned to her and she looked up at me with those gorgeous blue eyes. I looked at her from head to toe. Her hair hung just past her collarbone, and her smile was full, yet mischievous. My cock started to harden as she got that look. She started to laugh, and I saw her blush as she laughed. We talked and joked throughout the movie, taking in the movie with much of the action. She went downstairs, but I got up and went to the kitchen to check on her. When I went to her side she turned and smiled at me again as I was returning. Her eyes were twinkling in the candlelight. As I got closer I could see the slight sway of her body. Her breast were full and taut under the soft material of the nightgown. I leaned in towards her and she reached for my neck, sliding her hand up my side and across my chest. Her lips were mere inches from mine and I began to wonder what would happen if I ever saw her again. I could feel the heat from her lips on mine in seconds, and I could feel the softness of her tongue in my mouth.</p> <p>While she was in that position she had brought her mouth down on mine, pushing her tongue between my lips, and into my mouth with a passion. I started to respond to her kiss, pressing my tongue into hers. She broke away and started to tell me the story. She told me what a beautiful lover I was, and how much she wanted us the very next day. I started to lose myself in her story, and she looked at me. Her eyes went to my throbbing cock. She leaned forward and engulfed me in her mouth. Her eyes got big when she saw my cock. She looked up at me and smiled, wrapping her tongue around it to get it wet for when we fucked. I felt her tongue on the underside of my cock, just under the tip. "Oh sweetheart," I heard myself groan. She looked up at those big brown eyes again and smiled. Slowly she moved her mouth slowly back to my cock, sucking up the pre-cum from the head. As her mouth neared my crotch she stopped suddenly, looking up at me her eyes burning with desire.</p> <p>"Well, you're sure an interesting man you're having here, too," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, I think it's because you were the one who wanted me the most," I replied. I was wondering if her pussy was as wet as it was. She smiled and leaned against me again. My finger lightly danced across her wet flesh, tracing its way along the curves of her hip. I put the finger under her chin and raised it away from her mouth. Her eyes grew wider, and she moved her head slightly. I wanted her to kiss me. She was in control now. She had to want to kiss me. I wanted to kiss her. I put my finger under her chin and lifted it ever so slightly. Her mouth opened, and I pressed firmly into her. She pushed my finger back down her neck, and then her mouth, which was watering.</p> <p>"Do you like your new toy?" I asked.</p> <p>"Babyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
