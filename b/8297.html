I just watched them walking towards me in a circle, all eight of them sitting beside each other.</p> <p>"It's okay," said Sam. "We understand."</p> <p>My dad smiled. "That's what we're here for. We want to help you... we help you in any way we can. And we are okay with it. We do this all the time."</p> <p>I felt sorry for the boys. I wanted to ask them to help me, but I figured the game had already started—it was too late to ask right now. Just another game against the girls.</p> <p>"I'm just going to run and grab my bag and I'll tell them all to just get back inside." I said.</p> <p>"You got it." I said. "By the end of the game we'll have some good luck with these boys!"</p> <p>I watched them as I walked towards the door. My dad had already got up, and now I sat next to them on the couch.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind," I said. "I don't really know why you guys wanted to play games at the store, but it's a good opportunity."</p> <p>"We're not playing games here," my father said. "We're just going to sit here with you and talk for a little while. Let's hear how long you've been going out. What was your name last night?"</p> <p>I looked up at Sam: she had a beautiful smile on her face, and I knew she had been looking for that conversation.</p> <p>"Brianna, how's it?" I asked, waiting for her name to come out.</p> <p>She finally responded. "It's...nice."</p> <p>"So what are you waiting for?" my dad asked.</p> <p>"Well, just take a seat," Sam said. "It's not a particularly big game, but we're sure going to have fun."</p> <p>Brianna looked around at what we now all knew to be a very large game room. There were about 30 or 40 tables there, which we had seen before. We had been there about a month ago. Sam had a seat right on my right, and I sat opposite Sam.</p> <p>"Why don't you get started," I told the boys. "What's in these glasses?" I asked, waving them in front of my face.</p> <p>"It's all for you. You just wait for it." Sam replied.</p> <p>Brianna stood up and reached forward, handing the glass to Sam.</p> <p>"That seems to be pretty important."</p> <p>"It's a little something to begin with." Sam said. "It's a glass with a glass."</p> <p>Brianna got up and leaned over to kiss Sam. Her lips were soft and pliable, with a slight glossiness to her lips that suggested she had never tasted lipstick before. Sam's hands went straight to Brianna's firm ass and pulled her toward her, kissing the young girl back with enthusiasm. Sam's eyes met mine briefly before she dropped to her knees to the floor, and her hands went straight to Brianna's cheeks. With their kissing and mouths still locked, I saw that my face was still completely flushed from the game, and Brianna noticed.</p> <p>"Is that okay with you?" Sam said, breaking the kiss after just a minute.</p> <p>"Yeah. I should probably go too," Brianna said. "It's kind of hot out there."</p> <p>"I don't want to wait for an elevator." My dad said. "They would see us in the lobby."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. "I get the point," Sam said. "I think you should keep everyone else at the game too!"</p> <p>"Yes, I agree." I said, walking towards the door. "I don't know how long before I'm going to be able to get out of this game without my blazer running." I said, before going back to the couch. "It's still good to see your team again."</p> <p>I heard Brianna say, "And I'd like to say thank you properly."</p> <p>"That was definitely on my list." I said, putting on my coat.</p> <p>I had no idea if it would come off the ground, or if they would want me to bring my shoes back; if they did, that would be fine. I had done quite the job already, and it looked like the boys had a point. It was only fair that they could all get a piece of my game too.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>That night, Brianna and I talked over some of the cards. We had seen the game before, and it had been pretty exciting—it had given us an opportunity to take our own teams. We both knew there was also a game of the heart and our friendship would probably have—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
