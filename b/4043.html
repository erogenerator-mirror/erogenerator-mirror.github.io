The wet, juicy feeling of her juices flowing on my fingers was driving me wild, and I knew I had to have any part of her, inside my mouth or on my cock. Her juices were slick against my hand and I began to slide my finger along her, moving up my palm to circle her clit again and rub it, my other hand now pinching her nipples roughly, squeezing her tits and twisting my nipples, and she began to move her hips gently, rubbing herself back against my fingers faster and harder, and as she began to moan louder and to start humping my hand, I increased the pressure and speed of my hand on her clit, wanting to feel how much further she could go before she passed out! I could feel it build and build and my hand on her clit was the only thing holding her to orgasm - I could feel it pushing itself up into her, against her hot and soaking pussy. She was moaning my name harder than ever before, her body twitching and shivering as her orgasm passed, but still I continued to stroke her hard and fast as her body started to subside. At last she slowly collapsed to the bed, her body still twitching from the orgasm she had just had, her face turning to look at me, and I could see the look of pure pleasure there on her face as she said "What's your name?"</p> <p>"Joe" I replied, wondering what he looked like in her own body, even as we talked, knowing there was certainly nothing between us. She continued to lay next to me, staring at me, and I could see her hand on her breast, her nipple still hard and pointing up in the air. "How long have you been looking at me like that?" she said, still slightly dazed from the orgasm she had managed to have, now almost imperceptibly shaking and shaking. "I was just waiting for you to come around. I had never had a man to actually touch me like that... it was the most exciting thing I have ever felt." Her hand reached over and cupped my balls. "And you, I would hope you are able to experience this with anyone." She smiled as she squeezed my cock and I moved her hand away, telling her to wait for me there in the chair as I climbed out of bed. When I sat down, she turned around and lay back on my lap, her body still twitching slightly from her climax. "You have a lovely cock, too." she whispered. I started to rub it as we talked, my fingers slipping up into her, and her mouth fell open as my fingers slipped into her, and her body responded. She lifted her hips for me and pushed herself up until the head of my cock touched her opening. She lifted back up until I felt the head of my cock slowly pressing against the opening, and then down again. She smiled again as I pushed forward slightly, finding her wet and open hole but no cock yet. "Don't worry, I am sure you will be ready for me soon." With this, she guided my cock into her and slowly pushed herself up until the head slipped into her.</p> <p>Her body was warm and soft, her muscles slick with perspiration, and her mouth turned from smiling, as I slowly eased into her, my head filling her. She leaned back down, resting her weight on my lap as I filled her, pulling her legs up until my feet were against her chest. She lifted her hips and I slowly moved back, savouring the sensation of sliding inside her, the tight ring of her vaginal muscles gripping my cock as it slid through the opening. She raised her hips again and I pushed forward, feeling her body tense in anticipation when my cock fully entered her. I moved slightly back a little, feeling the tight sheath around my cock and her body responding to the movement, moving up and down slowly as she lifted, letting me slide in to the root of my cock, her body now moving up until the tip was brushing her cervix. I felt her hips lift off the bed as my cock reached its full depth and I continued pushing it, pushing against her cervix again as her lips tightened around me, and then relaxing almost imperceptibly as the full extent of my cock began to fill her, stretching her, rubbing her clit. We fucked slowly, feeling it now, the full force of love to each other. The pleasure we had both felt as our sex connected, the feeling of my head sliding inside her, filling her to my base, feeling her muscles moving against my body as my shaft slid in and out of her, felt her body sliding up and down, feeling my balls caress her, and as our passions rose, we lost ourselves in our own pleasure. I knew from her moans that she wouldn't last much longer, that the pleasure we were bringing her had exceeded all her previous experiences. I pulled my cockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
