She's also a fantastic cocksucker. I can really get away with using every trick in the book on some of my wife to give me orgasms. She knows I love it when she's on top of me and fucking me. There's no comparison. I love her from her tits to her cunt. I love her long shapely legs.</p> <p>For me, having two of her, and having her both while playing with one, is just about the single greatest pleasure of my life. And with her in my hands every time I cum, I'm really getting good at it.</p> <p>My wife is an anal virgin. I can almost tell the pain/pleasure she gets from her. She had only been taking it up the ass for about twenty years and it was always a good experience. Maybe it's the fact that she always has a sore ass and a slight ache in her tits. Maybe it's just pure luck that she really loves it up the ass.</p> <p>That's it. That's my story of love over my cock.</p> <p>And that's the end of that chapter as I get to the main point of my tale.</p> <p>So, for tonight, there won't be a "special" event. Tonight the evening will revolve around my wife. I'm not planning on having any kind of romantic, sexual sex with her at this point. We didn't discuss any kind of romance this night or in any of our previous years of marriage until now at least. The only thing we discussed was about our sex life. But, that's another story. In our first year of marriage, she told me we didn't even talk about the "relationship" that we had. We just talked about it and what we thought about it. That was the closest we have come to bringing up the subject of "the serious stuff".</p> <p>To see how far she can go with my sexual fantasies, and have them fulfilled, please sign here below. I'm still not quite sure where the story would lead, but just maybe, by the time I'm done writing with it, I'll be back with some answers on thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
