I’m glad they all got some time before I have to go back upstate.”</p> <p>We were now in our own little space, where privacy could be obtained. It may be the most opportune moment to discuss this with Jane.”</p> <p>He sat me down on the couch, placed a hand on my knee, gently but firmly, and leaned to kiss me.</p> <p>“Thank you for being honest with me.”</p> <p>“You were honest with me all along. You can’t get enough of me. And the sex is fine.”</p> <p>I smiled, “No, it’s not fine.”</p> <p>He pulled me into his arms, and we began a tender kiss again. I slid my body against his, enjoying the feel of his hard cock pressing against my stomach. Breaking the kiss, he moved his hand up to caress my cheek.</p> <p>“So tell me what happened after you took her home.”</p> <p>I kissed him again, “I’m not much to have fun with. We were lucky to get out. So, if you would just give me a call right away…”</p> <p>A smile crept onto his face again. He kissed me for a few moments, gently, and then pulled back and stood up. He looked down at me from his seat.</p> <p>“Come on. Let’s go get some food in.” He helped me to my feet and we headed out. I sat on our couch and pulled out my phone to call the house. We talked and laughed a little about the night things had already been done, but it wasn’t a real conversation. Neither of us wanted to talk about it.</p> <p>After picking up some food on his way, he made his way through the house and upstairs to the bedroom. “Do you have anyone with you at home?”</p> <p>“I think they’ll be here,” he said, getting into bed, and snuggling up to me, “You know you feel comfortable with me, right?”</p> <p>“Yes, I know.” That made him smile. “We should be getting all of this out of our systems, before he catches on to how I feel.”</p> <p>“Do you want me to stay?”</p> <p>“Of course we do.” His eyes were full of mischief.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, and lay on my back. He lay down on his side next to me, “Do you want me to stay with you? I’ll be here tomorrow, if I get free tomorrow. Do you do this for the rest of your life?”</p> <p>“Oh yeah, of course. I just wanted you to be sure.” It was almost a begging tone, and it made me blush.</p> <p>He put his hand on my chest to see it was all right. I wanted to do nothing more that wanton lustiness that I always get, but was scared of being wronged like this. That is until he was naked, lying next to me, and I opened my eyes to see his face. His eyes were so beautiful, and had the innocence of youth, like I can’t help but like him.</p> <p>I pulled him closer and kissed him fiercely before rolling on top of him. It was all the invitation I needed. The kiss became urgent, and the sound of our hips smearing against each other came from everywhere. He took my hand and made me touch him. As he rubbed my back, his erection was all the invitation I needed to pull him inside me. We rolled on top of one another on the bed. The bed was soft and comfortable, and was as comfortable as I could remember it in the last five years, since our last time together.</p> <p>We kissed and explored slowly. He ran his fingers through my chest and down my belly, coming to rest on my cock. I moaned, and pushed into him. We didn’t know if it was meant as a foreplay, or if it was the act of being sure of our relationship. But neither of us cared. Our kisses felt like nothing on any other day of our time together.</p> <p>I could feel him moving his body against mine, which meant more of his hardness rubbing against me. Our bodies slid against one another, and the feeling of our sex, our mutual intimacy, made a new discovery of what love is. He held my mouth with his own, pressing his mouth to mine, and sucked on my tongue that was dancing with my own. As our tongues intertwined, both of us felt like this was love, with all its passion and power.
