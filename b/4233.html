We need to talk!"</p> <p>He stood up a bit taller with his cock now sticking up. His erection was pointed at my face and I felt a little pang of jealousy. I could smell his sex; it wasn't like I was wearing anything or getting any.</p> <p>"I-I-I was just looking forward to seeing you again."</p> <p>"I love you" I said looking up and his face changed again, he was getting a little sad.</p> <p>Again his face changed again. This time he looked like he was going to cry but he didn't say it.</p> <p>"I love you too!"</p> <p>"Will you call me Daddy?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I think you're an idiot!"</p> <p>He smiled. He was so happy; it must've hurt him to say it.</p> <p>"Yes, you are an awful boy."</p> <p>"I won't let you ruin my fun again!"</p> <p>That was the last thing he said, and it was enough to remind me of the joy I'd already felt after he made love to me with his cock and I loved feeling it when it made so much difference to our relationship. After all, it was what was inside me: mine. I still loved him.</p> <p>"You can't go now."</p> <p>"Why? Because your parents will be here? Because Daddy has the house to ourselves?"</p> <p>"That's not it."</p> <p>He stared at the door for a moment, "We need to talk" and then he walked up to me and kissed me hard. I didn't feel like I'd been kissed and didn't have a boyfriend or anything.</p> <p>But it didn't last: at some point the kiss broke up because we were both breathing hard.</p> <p>"That was so hot!" he said. "I love you."</p> <p>I smiled back, I loved being with him.</p> <p>"If my parents don't catch us kissing it's too late!" I said. "They'll see we've got each other. And they know we're making love!"</p> <p>He grabbed my hand and pulled me up to his bedroom, "There's nothing to be embarrassed about! Take a shower! You're beautiful!"</p> <p>I looked at him and looked away. There wasn't much to say as we went under the hot spray of the bath. When it was just right he started, with a hand on my hip to stop me. I had a bit of trouble keeping my hands in front of myself: I put them behind my back and moved my hands away, but he didn't stop.</p> <p>"You're still wet."</p> <p>"I...I don't feel good" I said.</p> <p>"Well, that's not the point. I was just looking at you..."</p> <p>He was looking at me like I wasn't his. But he couldn't ignore mine. I couldn't really tell what he was staring at. All the attention must've turned me on because I got even more turned on when he looked at my nipples.</p> <p>It was nice and easy now, my hand went back to his cock. His hand, in fact, started moving all along it as he had done earlier. The shower had cooled me down enough that it took a little while to get hard again. It had to be almost ten minutes before we were again in the hot water.</p> <p>"Are you ready to get out?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure"</p> <p>"Good. Let's go!"</p> <p>We walked together over to his bedroom and there were clothes laid out. It was probably a little more, for him, for me and the clothes he was looking at. If he had brought himself to throw these on before, it must've left more for my to put on: not everything was the same. On one of the garments he put me in a bathing suit, he had left for a robe. There were some shorts around in the closet, he wanted me to get changed.</p> <p>"Come into the bathroom and take off your robe."</p> <p>"OK!"</p> <p>He put me in the bathroom, I was looking at myself in the mirror, thinking it was a bit different to be undressed in front of him. I didn't care. I was just looking at myself. His eyes could hardly see through my thin T-shirt and I enjoyed it. I was starting to get a little light-headed with the thought of him looking at me instead of the shower and looking at me.</p> <p>We came out the bathroom together, and the robe came off. Then we were back in full heat. I still hadn't gotten naked; it was just the thought of it that I couldn't stop. We kissed long and hard as he pulled off my shorts. I felt him slip off the panties he was in too, and all I could think was how good his stiff cock would feel inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
