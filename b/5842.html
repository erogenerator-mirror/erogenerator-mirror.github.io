I love my wife more than life itself. She loves me and loves what can be done to me. We have been going around the world in this way for almost 20 years. At first I always seemed like a real bitch at family functions. I'm never popular. It's always that way with other women. I'm the complete opposite of my daughter, my wife and my friends.</p> <p>In retrospect, I think it may be funny to see me with my daughter, but what's the point? As a married man, I can't imagine my son trying to protect his mother. She always says things like "Don't try to control my mother. You'll never get her." Or that he's just stupid.</p> <p>We had gone out for dinner one night. We got a taxi to our destination when the driver looked me directly in the eyes. Without saying a word, I leaned over and gave him a hug as he walked me past. He tried to hide the fact he was a jerk, but his eyes were on me the whole time. I'm sure he couldn't see much more than a woman's breasts.</p> <p>When we got back to our hotel room, he made me change into the night robe and a tiniest nightie. I put on a pair of pajama tops and my panties before we lay down in the bed. That was the moment I was dreading. It seemed like an eternity to me before I heard the door lock. We quickly made love. It hadn't been long of this before I was ready to cum.</p> <p>As usual, he fucked me very slowly then slowly and deliberately until I was on the verge of another orgasm and then he came into me. He lay on top of me with our foreheads touching. I could feel him hardening against me just as my orgasm neared and my husband was already there, filling me once again with his cum. His sperm was warm and so good. It was the first time in my life I ever came without my husband's cock inside me. For an instant I wondered whether I should be scared about him. Then again, if you had my son in you, how could you be jealous?</p> <p>A few days later, as the day wore on, I finally began to feel the tension of my marriage. I felt like I was about to give birth to our grandson. I got home from work one afternoon feeling very anxious about the upcoming wedding. I went into the bedroom and got my baby clothes. I came over to the bed and stood in front of the mirror, looking at myself once again. It was a moment that would haunt me.</p> <p>I had thought about having a child, but was afraid if it happened again, it would destroy our friendship. I didn't want to take things for granted, but that would have to change. We had been through all this in the end. I had no idea if my pregnancy would actually show on me. I knew that a child could be as big as my husband's and more, so I could take care of it with my husband.</p> <p>He had never said anything about a baby, but I heard the sound of our son's voice in the back hall as he was preparing to do up the furniture. I couldn't believe what I was watching. It wasn't fair, not at all. There was nothing I could do about it. That thought, that the thought of another child made me ill was more than I could bear.</p> <p>But then it was his turn to say something, and he asked me if I was okay. What could I say? I said, "It's my baby's. Are you sure you're okay with me having another child?"</p> <p>A minute later, he was walking away from the mirror, but I followed him. I never really thought twice about it. I knew he thought I was beautiful. I knew that I had just had a wonderful sex life, but he never saw me as anything I didn't try to live.</p> <p>Once we were alone, I pulled out my night clothes and told him to take a shower and leave his clothes downstairs. He agreed, saying he was going in to get them. I was just about to say something when a young man walked in.</p> <p>All that anger came pouring out of me. I knew it was only a matter of time before it would turn into a massive, violent fight. It had been the first moment of my married existence.</p> <p>We hugged and the father spoke softly, saying, "Welcome home, Mommy's baby."</p> <p>I said, "Thank you, Daddy."</p> <p>But I couldn't get it out of my head. I knew it wasn't a mother, but I didn't need a mother to tell me how to give birth. I walked out into the living room and asked my son if he would like to move in with me. I could hear him sobbingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
