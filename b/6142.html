She said as she looked up at me. We both knew that now was as good a time as any. We went out the door on a whirlwind romance as we headed back inside.</p> <p>"I'll see what I can come up with for you tomorrow" I said as we both started the car. I then turned around and headed back to the office. A couple of minutes later, a couple of hours later, and a couple more days passed. Things continued the same way for the next two months as things between us slowly went back to normal. That's when the problem really started.</p> <p>At work, my thoughts often drifted into one of those dark corners that I've kept a tight hold on all these years. I really enjoyed my work, but that's not even the most important part of my day. I also liked watching the women at the office constantly flirt between me and my co-worker. At least that's what it was for me. It was hard to focus on my work when my heart was racing like crazy. My mind was in a constant state of turmoil. It was so hard to be thinking about my co-worker being flirty with my boss's husband. Not to mention the thought that my pussy had been dampened by the sexual tension and moisture coming from it. It was so hard to find just the right moment to turn the conversation to something else and let it linger.</p> <p>The week before Valentine's Day, on my way home from my lunch break, I started on my shopping, knowing that I had to decide on a nice gift for the surprise visit that night. I wasn't sure that I'd be able to take all the stuff home. So out of the blue, I grabbed my bag and pulled off work before I started to change my mind. My heart had been racing for months and I felt like I was going to break down in a fit of uncontrollable crying sobs. What more is there going to give me? I pulled into the parking lot and stopped the car for a moment. I felt so good and it would be just the two of us together. The fact that I was going out to a romantic dinner with a man had me so excited.</p> <p>I walked in and closed the door and leaned against the door. I leaned back against the door and felt so much better. I started to turn back and head inside when I felt this strong hand on my shoulder, pulling me to the side. I turned to see a beautiful man standing a few inches from me, his dark hair pulled back and framing the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen. "I saw you looking at me." He said, almost as though he had just asked me to look at him. I didn't look at him, I just looked his rugged strong build. I was suddenly nervous, so nervous that my breath was labored as I stared at him and I saw in his eyes and what could only be envy at my reaction to his body. For a few seconds, the situation seemed like it was a long drawn out one-line moment. I was about to say something and I didn't. "Let's get out of here." I said at finally finding my voice. We started to walk, holding hands, as though we were the only two in the world. My heart was racing so fast that I could hardly breathe. I knew that I'd never told him what I was looking at and I didn't even know where to look. I loved everything about this man. There was something about him that I couldn't even put into words. Everything he was doing just made me so excited that I could barely breath.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>The next day, as I worked around the office, we started out the same way. We chatted and I felt comfortable with him. He was a nice looking man, probably 5' 5" maybe 175lbs of muscle. A great toned body, I realized. He was the kind of man that would be easy to flirt with and who I should just be comfortable with.</p> <p>Once we came down to the lunchroom and my nerves were back again, I was ready to tell him that I was going to lunch with my co-worker, when he looked up at me and I couldn't help feeling a twinge of sadness come over me. I felt so guilty about how much I had been wanting to talk to him. I couldn't help but think how he would react to meeting someone like me. I was so excited I started pulling my skirt down as I thought of meeting him again.</p> <p>After about an hour, when my co-worker was out of his office, he turned to come over to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
