They'll be waiting in the club for you."</p> <p>"Well I should go see if I can find out how things went."</p> <p>"Just let me know when your there and I'll be waiting."</p> <p>"It's too late to be on Friday night. It's a two-hour drive," I told her.</p> <p>'Not a second thought."</p> <p>"Ok you be ready in five minutes," I teased as I headed out the door.</p> <p>"So...do you want to do it this weekend."</p> <p>"Do what with me and my friends tonight."</p> <p>"No I just want to watch you dance with those guys."</p> <p>A wicked grin formed on her face, "They can't come with us!"</p> <p>As I walked into the club, I made a beeline for the dance floor where the men had left off dancing with his girlfriend.</p> <p>As I began to dance I thought of how sweet she looked in her nighty, with her nipples poking through and her body moving as she danced.</p> <p>As I leaned in with our hips touching I leaned forward to give her a kiss, not realizing how hard I had gotten.</p> <p>"I shouldn't have done that," she said trying to control her voice as she laughed.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, you'll like every minute of it," I assured her.</p> <p>As we danced I had a firm hold on her hips with one hand and she couldn't even look into my bright green eyes. With each grind in between us, she got more and more turned on and it didn't take much to make her wet with desire for me. I could feel it as her nipples stiffened from the dancing and felt my cock twitch as her hands went on my thighs.</p> <p>As the dance ended we took turns walking through the crowd of men who were now trying to get to her before it was too late.</p> <p>As we exited the crowded club she grabbed me and kissed me hard.</p> <p>"That was so hot...and exciting!"</p> <p>"I was ready," I smiled.</p> <p>We got into her car and I asked, "I wonder where you want to go now?</p> <p>"I'm sure we can find something fun to do."</p> <p>"Maybe after we sit around the block for a few hours we can go over to this little club I know of."</p> <p>"I want you to watch me dance and it will be so special for you."</p> <p>"Do you want me to join you or leave the club?"</p> <p>"Either way sounds good."</p> <p>As I followed her to my house, I leaned in and gave her a light peck on the lips, the tip of my tongue brushing hers as we went into her living room.</p> <p>We finished our kiss in the kitchen then I helped her to the couch and bent down to give her a soft kiss.</p> <p>"I had to do that for you," she panted, "because you're so damn sweet. Thank you so much for being my first."</p> <p>"You're a sweetheart," I said softly.</p> <p>After a few minutes kissing, nibbling and nuzzling, she reached for my zipper in my suit and was almost sure of what would happen next.</p> <p>"I need you inside me," she whispered, and when I was sure she was serious she dropped to her knees and began to unfasten my pants, sliding them down my thighs to remove the last covering of my briefs before she worked her tongue along the shaft of my cock.</p> <p>"It feels so good you're so sweet," I moaned, my hands running through her hair as she sucked me to the back of her throat.</p> <p>I couldn't help myself as her lips slid up and down my shaft while I watched her eyes as she worked her lips up and down.</p> <p>"Oh God," I groaned as she went faster. I couldn't hold back any longer as my load was almost ready to explode.</p> <p>"I want to taste you," she moaned, sliding me from her lips.</p> <p>She held my shaft straight up as she leaned in to kiss me. "Doing what? We have plenty of time before we change our minds.</p> <p>She looked up at me. "Why don't you put it in me?"</p> <p>I smiled at her, "You're on," then I reached out and took her hand, helping her onto her back with a kiss.</p> <p>As I watched, she spread her legs, giving me a perfect view of her sex.
