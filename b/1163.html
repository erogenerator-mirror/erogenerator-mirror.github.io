I spread them apart and felt some skin brush against me. His cock felt so hot and hard inside me it felt as if it could do it's own work as I rubbed my clitoris. This was the kind of torture that only I could make him feel. I felt it starting so I lifted myself up and lowered myself back down. The pleasure was incredible; as if his cock had the power and power to make it move in my pussy.</p> <p>I continued to rub and caress his cock and play with my clitoris until I was ready again. I reached down and grabbed his cock and began stroking him as I lowered myself down onto it. I took it in with one deep, hard thrust and fucked him while I was on top of him, using my weight to push his cock into me. His breath caught in his teeth as the sensations built.</p> <p>'Oh God! Oh God!" I groaned.</p> <p>I looked over his shoulder to see his eyes locked on my bouncing breasts hanging out and bouncing up and down as I fucked him. I moved one hand around to my clit and rubbed it as I felt myself building to the next orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I screamed. I felt the rush of sensation run through my body. My hands went to his arse while I began to grind hard against him. I felt his cock moving with my pussy as my body started to tingle from the intense stimulation. His body began to convulse as he let out a loud grunt that I knew would send me over the edge. I continued to move until I felt his cock begin to spasm as it shot load after load of hot, salty cum into me.</p> <p>We held each other tight for several minutes as he relaxed his body and we tried to get our breath. Finally we calmed down and looked at each other with contented smiles and smiles until my eyes snapped to his. I noticed he wasn't crying anymore but he looked very vulnerable and vulnerable.</p> <p>It was my turn again. I lifted myself up and turned around on him. I turned back and sat on him. Before he realised what was happening I had impaled myself on his cock. He put his arms around me and we kissed. Softly at first, but with greater urgency as we got lost in our passion. I moved my hips up and down slowly as we made out. His hands roamed over my body and he squeezed my breasts and then kissed me more intensely. I rubbed myself against his chest as I rode on him. I felt his cock grow rock hard as his cock slid in and out of me as I lowered my hips and rode him.</p> <p>His hands slid down my body and his fingers began to tease my clitoris. I felt another orgasm building, stronger than the first that had just passed and I had to push harder and harder against him. I felt him increase his movements as our orgasms washed over us, he was holding me up and I felt his seed gushing into me. He lay on top of me as we kissed and we both felt the last of our orgasms diminish.</p> <p>We lay there motionless as our breathing returned to normal. He kissed my forehead. I kissed his cheek and then kissed his neck. He looked so happy as he kissed me.</p> <p>We must have fallen asleep for a few seconds until he began to stir. He rolled over and took me in his arms. He rolled himself over on top of me. I put my arms around him as we kissed.</p> <p>"Are you always so ready to lose weight?" I asked in a soft voice.</p> <p>"I guess I am the old man," he said.</p> <p>"I've always been a stickler for the rules," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>"No I'm the new guy in the big city, the new manâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
