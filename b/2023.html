The skirt was short and it clung to my thighs in a way the tightness of the stockings I wore was quite evident. When she asked if I wore hose and heels she looked me over then said I should put on my business shoes. That put me on the edge of a decision. I stood up and tried to decide what I would do. I finally decided to do something about the skirt. The hem rose about mid-thigh but stopped just above my knees, only half way up with each step. I looked her from head to toe until she finally turned around to look at me standing by the mirror.</p> <p>"What do you think, do you think we look sexy?"</p> <p>I said yes; "I think so much more sexy than this little outfit."</p> <p>As I turned the mirror I could see her lips begin to part as I looked in the mirror. The effect was immediate and my pulse quickened as the light flashed across her face. She turned to walk slowly toward me and bent down to kiss the corner of my mouth.</p> <p>To say I felt turned on would be an understatement. Her mouth moved back and forth over mine and I couldn't find the words to say, the only sound being the slap of our lips. After our lips parted I felt her begin to grind against me as I stood and walked backwards until I was standing by the sink. It was a matter of turning to face me as we began to kiss again as we made our way back upstairs to the large master bedroom.</p> <p>I was more than ready and I pushed her back onto the soft bed. I had to taste her for everything I wanted to. I kissed her gently on her lips, she responded by running her finger over my lips as I opened them and tasted her. I moved down her neck kissing and nibbling as I moved over her breasts. As I looked down at her nipples I saw them stiffen under my attention. I took that as my cue and moved over her body again. As I moved lower I began to kiss her thighs and then her navel causing her to moan. When I got to the top of her knee I looked up at her and smiled. She opened her legs and I kissed her pussy as I moved up her leg, kissing the inside of her thigh and coming up her body again. This time kissing up her body as I moved my attention to her breasts. I kissed first one and then the other as I watched her. When I moved to her lips I kissed them very gently and then kissed my way down to her tummy. When I reached her belly button I kissed over it again and then moved lower still leaving her quivering in anticipation. When I got to her pussy I moved my hips back and forth.</p> <p>As her legs were spread and I could now see her glistening lips they opened slightly just enough and I licked. She was wet and ready so I moved in and slid my tongue in one stroke of her. Her whole body stiffened as I tasted her and licked her more fully. Her body continued to wriggle against mine as I continued to tongue fuck her as her hands reached under mine. I moved up her body and placed one of my hands behind her neck pulling it up until my tongue was inside her and then holding it there as I kissed her lips again.</p> <p>Sensing she wanted me to move back I moved back and stood next to the bed. I moved up close to her where I lay in front of her and leaned over pulling her to her knees. My hands moved to her shoulders and back causing her to arch her back. I reached between us and felt her hard nipples. I slowly began to knead them as I kissed her mouth again and then moving south, I moved my mouth to her breasts and began to lick and suck them as I moved down her body toward her pussy. I was anxious to taste her which turned me on even more. I felt her hand on the back of my head pulling me to her. I moved my mouth over her mound just as she had done to me and began to lick her as I moved my tongue to her opening. When I reached her opening I pushed my mouth in as she took my head in between her legs and pulled me toward her. I could feel her body begin to shake and she was moaning and squirming as I continued at her clit. I moved up her body and I could feel her body tense as her orgasm began to build. She pushed my head back and said "don't stop."</p> <p>When the first wave of her pleasure began to wash over her body she screamed my name in a voice that I'm not sure I would have recognized at work. She began to shake and quiver with the first wave of her orgasm. As it came to an end her body began to move up and down. She was bucking herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
