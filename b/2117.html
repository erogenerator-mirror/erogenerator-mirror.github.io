My tone conveyed everything. I hadn't decided, but I wanted.</p> <p>"Let me see if you're up for a little fun right now."</p> <p>He did. He picked me up and laid me on the bed. He lay down next to me and ran his hand up and down my thighs.</p> <p>"Your legs are fine too."</p> <p>"It's the hair, isn't it?"</p> <p>"You've got the perfect ones!" I heard a small smile on his lips.</p> <p>"Yeah, I've got them."</p> <p>He gently pushed one foot under me, and I felt him kiss one leg as he kissed all the way up the other. I was in heaven. I was tingly all over, all the way down to the tip of my pussy, and he was licking me so nicely.</p> <p>He reached up to take the hem of my skirt and I lifted my hips. He removed my skirt and tossed it on the chair behind me. Then he was back to kissing me, caressing me and stroking my body with those long, strong fingers. I was so wet and ready, and his fingers rubbed me into an intense orgasm that almost set my body off.</p> <p>"Oh god, Mr. H," I moaned. "Fuck me. You feel so good."</p> <p>He stood above me, taking his time. He slowly massaged me through my pants as he slipped his cock out. He rubbed the tip of his cock along my lips. I looked down and watched him slide his member right inside of me. He held himself still, allowing me to get used to his big dick.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, oh, oh, right there," I moaned. "Please just fuck me."</p> <p>"Are you sure you're not going to do something about your underwear?"</p> <p>I felt him move his hands to hold them to me.</p> <p>"Yes! I'm not wearing any! I just wanted them, Mr. H."</p> <p>"They're mine, too. I can put them on later if you want."</p> <p>"I do. I do."</p> <p>He pushed my legs outward so my dress fell away from my hips and my body exposed the tops of my stockings, and the rest of my panties. He was looking at me, and looking at my legs, which were spread so I could feel that he was looking at my pussy.</p> <p>He knelt on top of me. He took his time, savoring my juices with his mouth. I loved the feel of his tongue; it made me squirm and gasp. Then he put his mouth over my cunt, and licked my clit, which made me tremble. He sucked on me, rubbing his fingers around inside of me. I let out a deep moan. I was close, so close.</p> <p>He licked my juice again, and moved up. My pussy smelled like me. He put his tongue right against my clit and gently rubbed. The excitement of that was almost enough to make me explode. He licked faster. He slipped three fingers inside me and I came. I wanted to throw him on the bed, but I didn't, not exactly. I wanted to come in his face, all over him. He stood up, and kissed me in a passionate, rough-as-usual kiss. He put my panties on the chair; I was naked.</p> <p>"I'm ready, Mr. H. I want you to fuck me now."</p> <p>He walked away; I took the dress off, and threw it on top of the chair. I heard fabric against fabric, and felt like I was in some kind of sexual ballet; he was putting his clothes back on, and I was naked, standing there in a dress!</p> <p>There I was, naked, all vulnerable and aroused, in his bedroom. It was as if the spell had been broken. I was in bed with him and loving it.</p> <p>This whole night had gotten even wilder.</p> <p>I wasn't sure how I was going to react when he came into the room. I did my best to keep my composure, and I did.</p> <p>He sat next to me on the bed as we held hands. The feeling of power and power over this man.</p> <p>"So much for being scared," I told him. "I've been very naughty all day long."</p> <p>His body was warm under me and I could smell the manly scent of his cologne. "Not anymore, you need to let the mood lighten."</p> <p>He laughed. "I think I do, too. My pussy has always been damp."</p> <p>I was glad that he didn't ask me to do anything. He wanted me in the best way.</p> <p>"I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
