They had both their heads tilted forward as if to peer over the shoulder of my car. As we approached the bar I saw that they stopped when we entered. They were both wearing bikinis with bikini bottoms and their legs were bare. They were standing beside their table in an animated conversation that was almost indistinguishable from the conversation. Their drinks arrived and I was surprised to hear "My wife's so hot," and said "I love the way she tastes" with an impish grin on my face. The hostess approached me and told me that the next dance would be at 1:30 and that she knew where everyone was dancing. I was feeling very nervous and I could not wait to see whether I could get in her pants, though. We started to dance and danced slowly to the sounds of the soft jazz music. After a couple songs of slow dance, I turned to her and gave her a long kiss, and began to nibble on her ear as I moved my way down to her neck. My cock tented my pants and I felt her start to respond. I whispered in her ear that I wanted her to take off her bikini top and dance with me. Again we both turned and looked around to see if anyone could see us on the dance floor. The couple that had been sitting across from us was sitting on a small platform facing us, and they were watching the dance in amazement. I felt like I could not move any differently if I wanted to, so I removed all my clothes and she stripped off her top and slid her shorts down.</p> <p>"You want to see your wife in her bikini?" I thought to myself.</p> <p>"Y...you are such a naughty man." I thought to myself. She stood in front of me wearing a skimpy, short swimsuit, but with a white thong. I started to caress her back and she said "I'm so glad you liked it", and we continued dancing. She moved her hands around to my crotch and began to rub my cock through my pants, and I could feel her nipples through the thin fabric of her suit. After a couple minutes of fondling her I pulled her up off the dance pole and we walked over to the large sliding door, which we could both see through the large glass doors. I led her into the large Jacuzzi room where a small table and chair faced the pool. I sat her on the padded bench. I leaned over to her and put my hands on her shoulders. I could see the top of her breasts and my cock bulged in my pants. "That feels so good", I thought to myself as her breasts moved against my chest. I kissed her on her neck and slowly slid one of my hands down to her thigh where I began to squeeze it, inching the material higher until I could feel the heat coming from her crotch. I kissed across her jaw and gently nibbled her earlobe, then slowly kissed across her jaw to her chin, and then back to her chin. My hands slipped down onto her inner thighs where once again my thumbs stroked her outer lips. I could smell her arousal. I kissed my way to her mouth. My own tongue moved across hers and I tasted the flavor of her mouth with her perfume. Kissing the front of her lips slowly I pressed my tongue inside her mouth. We were locked in a sexual dueling embrace as our tongues began to seek a better understanding of each others tongues and the texture of her saliva. I could feel her body beginning to move against mine, and we kissed passionately.</p> <p>Breaking from the hot embrace she said "That was soooo good, honey", and sat still with her mouth slightly open. I could tell she was feeling a little flushed. Slowly she sat up and I saw goose bumps forming on her legs and across her breasts. She pulled me toward her and I sat up on the bench beside her to kiss her again. She pressed herself against me, and I felt her breasts against my chest as our kiss deepened. Her nipples were hard and I could feel her breasts rising and falling. She began to slide her hand down the front of my pants and my swollen member slid easily through the thin material. We continued to kiss until she broke away and said "Let's see what you have in store for the rest of your trip". She pulled down my zipper and slid my pants and briefs down together. My cock was hard and standing very straight in front of me. She pulled me up from the bench and leaned over to kiss me again. I could only lie back and enjoy the full body contact for a couple minutes, then she stood up and began pulling on my belt and pants. I raised one leg up to let her pull them off of me. She tossed each of my shoes off and reached her arms around my waist. We embraced in another hot and passionate kiss. I felt her nipples pressing against my chest.
