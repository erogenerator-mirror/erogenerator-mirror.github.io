"I can get her a little more comfortable."</p> <p>I pulled my pants and underwear down as best I could and she quickly pulled a condom over the head of the rubber cock. I didn't think it would be necessary, but for some reason I didn't mind. It felt strange sliding inside her as she squirmed and gyrated around me. This was so much more intimate than what we've been doing at home, especially after all the years of having "real" sex.</p> <p>"Let's get inside before Mom and Dad come in the room," Karen said.</p> <p>"I don't think it's an appropriate place though," I said sheepishly.</p> <p>She nodded in agreement and pulled herself in close. "I don't know."</p> <p>I wasn't entirely sure how to start with this, but the whole scenario was way off. Karen had been intimate with the opposite sex before, and this time it was with a stranger. I was so overwhelmed that I almost forgot about her. Then I remembered that she was wearing a new bra on under her t-shirt. I pulled it down her arms and looked at her chest briefly. I could see her tits pressing up from under the bra.</p> <p>Karen pulled back for a second, surprised. "I didn't know guys had this kind of view."</p> <p>"I'm not that big," I said, grinning.</p> <p>"No, you're not!" she said with some confusion.</p> <p>"I wasn't saying anything." I put my hands on her breasts and began to roll the nipples around in my fingers. I could feel my cock growing in her hand as we moved to the couch.</p> <p>Karen began to moan. "Mmm, that feels good. Keep doing that," she said as she pushed me onto the couch. The head of my cock slid from her pussy and down to the opening of her pants. I pushed her skirt aside to see the beautiful blonde in front of me. Her legs were spread wide and I felt the dampness of her panties between her lips. Karen felt me move and turned to look at me. I pushed down the panties so I could see her pussy. I thought about how I had felt the last time we had made love and hoped the new me didn't notice as Karen turned around to face me.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just a little show," I replied.</p> <p>Karen didn't say anything. The sight of this stranger was overwhelming. I was feeling a little awkward and I felt that I might get up the nerve to tell her about what we had been doing. We both looked into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"You're not making a scene," I said.</p> <p>"Maybe, but I'd rather think that you do," she said, grinning at me.</p> <p>I sat up to see how the other people would react. They watched us for a few moments before finally coming to terms with our situation. I stood up and started pulling my pants up. Karen was still on the couch, smiling and staring at me and I suddenly felt embarrassed.</p> <p>"Well, I guess that's your show then," I replied, trying to act as if I was just joking and then realizing that Karen probably wasn't.</p> <p>"Sure, but maybe she wants to get home and take a nap," she said. Karen pulled her skirt back down and put on some clean clothes. "Maybe we should move out."</p> <p>"No, let's go," I said.</p> <p>"Really? That's it? I thought we were friends?"</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe. It wasn't easy getting her to do those things."</p> <p>"Why can't it be easier if she takes care of herself?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," I said. "I don't think I'll have another chance if she does anything like that."</p> <p>"You'll be fine, baby," she said. "I think that maybe you should go."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know. I know there's probably something wrong with the way I look," I said.</p> <p>"I'm sure there's nothing wrong with your face, but I should warn you -- don't do such a thing," she warned me. "Don't give up on yourself, if that's what you want. I'll see you later."</p> <p>"Thanks, Mom," I said. "I think I really liked that."</p> <p>She laughed and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "If it were up to me, I'd join you there."</p> <p>"I hope so," I said. "I really do."</p> <p>She pulled up her t-shirt and panties and satâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
