I said I wanted to take a swim before we got back to my place. He looked at me oddly and I saw the smile cross his face. I asked him to tell me about his life while I showered. We got back in the car and drove again. The drive out of town took several hours. About 20 minutes. He told me stories about his travels.</p> <p>After about 20 minutes we parked and headed towards his apartment. I noticed he had his keys out of his hand and they were in his jacket pocket. "What?" he said. My hand was shaking I thought.</p> <p>"Your keys. Do you want to take them or don't you want to take them," I said. He was shaking so hard I thought he might pass out.</p> <p>"I told you I like to take advantage of the moment" I said as I reached into his pants pocket and pulled out his cell phone. He laughed. "The moment doesn't make sense to me" I said as I pressed the button. He held his hand out for me to take. I did so and he placed his hand on mine and held it while I kissed the back of his hand lightly.</p> <p>We got in his apartment complex and walked up the stairs. I was standing there with his hand in my pocket, but all around me were people watching us walk along.</p> <p>I pulled his hand to my lips and he smiled at me. "My place or yours?" he said.</p> <p>I started walking towards his room. He followed. This was too easy for me to refuse him. I opened the door and we went in his bedroom. I took out a small bag and looked inside. He had his tie up and a long robe hanging over his left shoulder.</p> <p>"Oh my, what is this?" I said as I came closer to him. "You look so good," he said.</p> <p>He was about 6 feet tall. I could see the muscles on his arms.</p> <p>"You want me to make you come again?" he said as he wrapped his arms around me.</p> <p>"Not just yet," I said as I started to walk away. I thought he looked like a teenager.</p> <p>"I want you to," I said as my hand touched him on the left leg, and his leg on the right. He held me from behind. "I want to do it with you," I said.</p> <p>He kissed me hard and passionately. A tongue went into my mouth and he moaned. I ran my hands up his sides and gently kissed the top of his head. He reached his arms around me and pulled me to him. After a few seconds I had him on his back on the bed.</p> <p>I kissed my way up his neck, across his chest and chest. He moaned. As I knelt beside his head I began to caress his body. He put his hands behind my head and used the leverage to get me to kiss his lips, his chin and his neck. I kissed my way down his body. He lifted his knees.</p> <p>I looked up at him. "Why don't you show me what you can give me?" he said as he lifted his feet.</p> <p>Slowly I kissed my way up his body. My mouth had a path from his stomach to his chest. Slowly I took the tip of my tongue and swirled it around his nipples. He had both his hands behind his head, which meant he was still moaning.</p> <p>I was starting to move down to kiss his stomach when I stopped. "No," he said. "Please. I want to kiss and make you come before I even try to do anything with this," he said as he reached up with both hands, which had no use anymore of covering him.</p> <p>I slowly started to lower myself down as he put his hands on the back of my neck and pulled me to him. I was kissing his lips when his cock was on my cheek. I put my lips next to it and I moved down to taste his precum. As much as I wanted to feel it everywhere I couldn't. I moved back up to his lips.</p> <p>He put one of his hands on my shoulders and held me up. He asked me if I wanted his body back as I had it's part in his mind. I smiled and nodded yes.</p> <p>I got on my knees and put his penis between my breasts and he grabbed his hips and used them to guide it to my face. I took his penis in my mouth and he began to move it around with the left and right motion. It was different to the right. He let go of his hips, but he kept them there.</p> <p>With my right hand I lightly caressed his testicles. That was all he needed to begin to let go.
