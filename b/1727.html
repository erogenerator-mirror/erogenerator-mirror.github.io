I'm not sure how to wear them, but they're going to stay on just right," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"You know. I think the black ones really do their job; they don't get in the way. Let's go."</p> <p>I laughed, grabbed us two beers and headed back upstairs. When I went through his room door I couldn't believe how sexy it was. It was more than one room, and a couple of beds and a TV screen in one room to put it mildly. I could clearly see the bed. I also knew the rest of the room. I had seen many of those things before, including his own bed. I guess this room was different than the other room. The view of him made me think about his naked body. I couldn't believe how much I was getting off just thinking about that.</p> <p>After walking around a bit more, I slipped my panties off. I know it seems strange to wear panties, but the way they slide over your balls and into your asshole, the way they grip your cock, that I wanted to see so much. I slowly peeled them off, and it just barely covered the hole at the bottom. I took a quick look around. It was quite an improvement from the last time I had sex in the car. I had been afraid to let the driver on my legs. I mean, it was like taking a walk in the parking lot. You felt a little left out in front of my car, and the drivers horn was getting louder. I turned around and walked out of the hallway. Now we could pass the men in the hallway and then enter his room.</p> <p>We stopped at the end of his queen-sized bed. There he was topless as he laid on his side, facing me. I leaned into his arm and inhaled. It sent a shiver down my spine and my knees went weak. I could feel his breath coming into my ear as I leaned in.</p> <p>"You look like you're ready," he said with a smile. He reached up and pulled my hair to the side. I couldn't help but look at his face as he did it. He took two fingers and slipped them between his lips. He took them on his tongue and pushed them into my mouth. I sucked on them like a starving babe wanting a piece of pie. It didn't take long before he had me back in my body like a rock and I was melting.</p> <p>He picked up a pair of silk scarves and tied them together. He tied them around the back of my neck with two big loops. He held my arms down and held them under his.</p> <p>"I am going to fuck you," he said as he kissed my neck softly. I closed my eyes as that felt awesome.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I can tell it feels good." I let me words out as he pressed against my lips, pressing my hands up and holding my shoulders in place. He kissed down my neck at a leisurely pace. His lips felt so good on me. I had already decided that this man was very good at pleasing me. He kissed down my shoulder and back up, stopping when his lips were just above my ear.</p> <p>"I want you to cum a lot when I fuck you," he whispered in my ear. I knew what that was saying, I was only a man. All I wanted was to please him like no I had in a long time. He took his two fingers and rubbed them around my asshole. He inserted both fingers and began fucking me with them. Oh God, it felt so dirty so quickly. His fingers felt so good on me. I had never cum with a man before.</p> <p>He took his fingers out, got my face up and kissed me. I felt my dick starting to rise, but I didn't think it was going to do much. I felt it hard at the back of his throat, and I just wanted to be held. I didn't want to cum without him.</p> <p>He whispered in my ear. With one last lick across my mouth, and then kissed me again, he slowly pushed down my underwear and pants. I was really nervous. I have never been in this position before. He took a condom out of the dresser drawer and opened it. He put it on me, slid me into it, and began fucking me with hard thrusts. It felt right to him. I felt so dirty and so horny. I felt so nasty to have my skin pressed against him with his hard cock stuffed into my ass. I felt so alive and hot and in control. It turned me on to hear him call me filthy names. It made me want to be bad and to feel helpless.</p> <p>He said his dirty talk, but I heard him. He said that his cock felt very good fucking my ass. He wanted me to feel what aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
