She was asleep still, sitting in the armchair reading her book. This might be too big of a shock for her, but I got a thrill from watching her do that.</p> <p>She turned around then, "Good morning lover boy!" she said cheerfully. I had no idea I had made a mess on her sheets last night, but I could tell she was a mess of a mess that she might well have even given us our privacy.</p> <p>"How was your weekend," I asked.</p> <p>"Fine, but you better hurry before I start complaining again!" she said grinning. We continued to talk as I cleaned up and left the room. She was still at it when I got back to my bedroom.</p> <p>I showered and put on my pajamas, and went back into the living room. The book I was reading had been forgotten, but I reread it when I heard her come in.</p> <p>"What's with the nightie?" she asked, still in the same position she was when I woke up.</p> <p>"Do you wear that to bed?" I asked.</p> <p>"No I don't, I just got up. I didn't start with it, but it was a good one. Now turn around."</p> <p>She turned to me, and I started to get into bed.</p> <p>"We can leave it on for a while if you like," she suggested.</p> <p>"No, I still need time to get ready, that's why tonight was fun, but tonight has been fun too. It's only been about a week since we slept together." She laid down next to me and reached over to turn off the lamp and put her arm around me. "I'm still sore down there."</p> <p>I just looked at her. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, please stay with me tonight, I want to feel you against me."</p> <p>Just that quick we were both sound asleep. When I woke she was spooning me, and a warm hand was running up and down my body.</p> <p>"Come on lover boy, let's get off the bed," she said as she snuggled up even more.</p> <p>I got out of bed, grabbed an extra pair of panties and a robe and a pair of running shorts on the way downstairs to the kitchen and the bathroom. She had a bathrobe on that she was about to put on and she was drying her hair very quickly from my previous shower.</p> <p>"Oh I'm sorry honey, that's part of the surprise."</p> <p>"You are so kind," I replied, "it was kind of fun!"</p> <p>She put the robe on quickly, "I thought it might be fun tonight, but I'm sore."</p> <p>I put my robe on to get ready to go to the park, I picked the panties up from the hamper and wrapped it around my waist. "This is the best way."</p> <p>"You're a good sport, I'd say, because you'll just be sleeping naked under that thing."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like the idea. Where are you going," I asked, taking the panties from her hand and tossing them out the door.</p> <p>"I'll show you," she suggested. She pulled open the bathroom door and was pulling back the curtain when she peeked in.</p> <p>"Why don't you sit up on the toilet," she suggested. Her gown was down around her knees and she was sitting on the toilet. "It's warm."</p> <p>Since we weren't naked we were just wearing just a pair of panties and a robe, my robe was only half down my thighs, but it was not covering much anyway.</p> <p>She sat and I slid the robe over me, putting it under me instead of covering me. I was naked under the robe. She got down on the toilet seat, and I climbed down too, sitting with my back against the toilet and my legs just below the toilet, making sure to close around hers as I sat in it, and my arms were at my side.</p> <p>After a while I felt her hands all over my thighs, and she was stroking me between them. When I started to moan, she stopped me. "Oh, this is nice, but I want to do something for both of us." And she started kissing the tip of my dick.</p> <p>"What's it to you?" I asked.</p> <p>"My hands are doing something. Maybe you'd like to kiss them?"</p> <p>"Sure," I said, "what's your idea?"</p> <p>"Just think of me as someone other than the naked body you've laid back on for me."</p> <p>"That might be fun," I said enthusiastically.</p> <p>"It sure is," she said. "Do you like it when I kiss your dick?" It turned outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
