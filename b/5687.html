I suggested.</p> <p>"Fine." He sighed. "You're just so different."</p> <p>"Look, this is fun, but I don't want you to leave here." I pulled up onto my bike and started the motor.</p> <p>"What? Why?"</p> <p>"I'll get you back if you don't make me leave here."</p> <p>"Don't you think you'd like to stay here with me?"</p> <p>"You still think I'm just some guy in a hot tub with your girlfriend?" I asked. "Why should I believe you?"</p> <p>"I'm not a man in the tub. I'm just a man doing my business."</p> <p>I chuckled, feeling really uneasy inside. He was talking too much.</p> <p>"I should get going," I said, leaning over and grabbing my shoulder.</p> <p>"Yeah." He grabbed me tightly. "I love you."</p> <p>That didn't escape me. He turned toward the door. I watched him walk away from me. I was afraid I would walk into a brick wall. I didn't want to leave.</p> <p>We rode home in silence. If he was really unhappy, I didn't doubt he would want us to have sex when I was feeling down. He didn't seem at all upset. I couldn't believe it. The last two days of having to be alone. I guess we'll see how much he's going to remember.</p> <p>When we got home, I didn't think anything else about it. I didn't even think about anything except how badly it hurt. That night was an incredible night. I couldn't even remember when I kissed him. It was just the beginning of the rest of the night.</p> <p>He called once that week to get the tickets and asked if I could come and pick them up. I felt bad and had to give him my permission first. I was reluctant to go home to get the tickets, even in the circumstances.</p> <p>He seemed to be disappointed. He was disappointed with my choice. It didn't seem to matter to me. We said our goodbyes together and went our separate ways.</p> <p>The day before the ticket was sold I went to the store to get my checkbook. I was surprised to see that I'd been out on the road not three hours from home.</p> <p>My father's credit card bill was still there, though. I started to panic.</p> <p>I couldn't think of anything to do. My mind went back to the night before and what we did that day. Then I had a vision of it. I can't imagine ever doing anything like that again for anyone.</p> <p>I didn't sleep for the rest of the week.</p> <p>I got back to the apartment at 8 a.m. and was glad to see there was nothing else to do. I sat down on my bed and fell fast asleep.</p> <p>When I woke up Monday morning, I still couldn't sleep. When I was back to work, I was still feeling horrible. I got home pretty early.</p> <p>After showering, I changed and went to work. I had a couple of appointments on Tuesday, but could wait that week before making any other plans. When that was done, I went home for breakfast and found no reason to be there. I looked for the place where we'd had breakfast and was disappointed. I didn't see my dad.</p> <p>I ate my scrambled eggs, bacon and hash brownies, thinking about what we'd do if he wanted to have sex with me while I was in the middle of some meetings.</p> <p>When I got home, I went straight to bed. I had a very bad day. I didn't even touch myself as I tried to think of what I would do when he came home.</p> <p>When I got home that evening, I was exhausted. I didn't feel much of anything except for a little light falling over my eyes. I felt like a mess at that point.</p> <p>I'd been up all night, so my mind was too focused on something else. When I got to bed in record time, I just went to sleep.</p> <p>I woke up early, still in a state of shock. I had no idea what the hell I'd gotten myself into. I got up as I had to go to the office to work. I walked by my sister's door and heard her crying. I had a lot of crying to do as well. I had to think about things.</p> <p>When I finally stopped sobbing and started to get home that night, I didn't know if I was too late. I couldn't think of anything else and just went to bed.</p> <p>The next morning I was late for another meeting. On my way home that night, my cell went off.
