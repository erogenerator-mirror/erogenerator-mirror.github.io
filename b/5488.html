Do you like it?"</p> <p>"It's not what I was talking about. I mean, it feels really good, but really not to the same level of pleasure."</p> <p>"I don't have anything on under where I'm sitting."</p> <p>"It doesn't smell like..." He turned to look at her. "It tastes as good as you say. We both know." He took a breath with a smile. "So... are you going to take my dick up your..." he paused to take a slow, deep breath.</p> <p>"No..." She held her hand up to stop him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, baby. I know this is crazy and everything. I know how weird it is for a woman to want to watch a guy orgasm." He smiled again and leaned back on his elbows. Now she was getting the picture. She wanted to pull her sweater down some and jerk herself off so badly right there in front of him. "I can't hold back anymore. I don't have anything else to do, so I'm going for it." With that, he grabbed her head and brought his dick to the entrance of her mouth. He paused at the top, then brought the tip to her lips.</p> <p>"Just for my baby... for a second." The man grabbed the base of his dick and started up a long slow rhythm. His lips met hers and then he just let his body go... as if breathing in her as much as she was breathing in his as he kissed her. It didn't matter that her pussy had been dripping all that time, or that his dick felt so good on her face because she'd already told him how much she loved the taste of herself. Her pussy just felt good...</p> <p>"Baby... you're gonna cum."</p> <p>"If you do it for me, I'm not gonna stop." She closed her eyes and leaned back.</p> <p>"Yes!" she said with an enthusiasm he hadn't seen before from her. And with enough care and tenderness, she gave her virginity to the man she loved. And she didn't care how much more of a virgin she could be without losing it completely...</p> <p>-</p> <p>The first time she took his cock in her ass was when he used a lubricant and had to press one of her legs to his shoulder before he could finally fit his entire shaft into her. Once he was inside, he started out slowly. It took a little more pushing to get all the way in, but once he started going slowly, she relaxed her muscles and he started to thrust. It felt pretty good, so she couldn't really care anymore. She loved sex. She loved feeling his big dick inside her and she loved having it in her ass. She wanted to cum, too, and just let it happen.</p> <p>In her mind, she'd never believed she could ever be gay, and in her mind, she wanted to start thinking of men with a male role that included sex. She felt a stirring in her pussy as she started to grind up against him, but she kept quiet.</p> <p>"Don't be gay, baby," she whispered. "I love how it feels to feel him inside me. I want it."</p> <p>"But you said no anal."</p> <p>"No, I didn't." She smiled softly. He had the most wonderful ass, she thought. "But, I feel so empty right now."</p> <p>"Are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"Yep. And trust me, it'll feel better." She turned around and kissed him with fervor. She could hear his cock jump in her ass, and she squeezed it to increase and increase the friction. Then it was time to turn around and take him down. With her ass still full of cum from earlier, she moved to kiss him. She pulled him back towards her and took his dick again into her asshole. He followed her with a series of moves that were more like thrusting and stroking. Once again, he could feel that he was about to cum, too. Then they got more intense without stopping and she felt a warm sensation that she hadn't felt before. They were both panting when he let go with another load inside her.</p> <p>Still on her back, she pulled him on top of her. They lay there for a moment, sharing a kiss. Then she pulled him on top of her and they both slid down so they could start to kiss again. It was one of the best kisses they'd ever shared. When they finally stopped, she looked at his face and saw how serious he was about what had just happened.</p> <p>"That was so awesome." She kissed him again. "I needed that, too. I'm so glad we came tonight."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>-</p> <p>Theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
