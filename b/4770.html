"I really don't get why he would like me to do this."</p> <p>I sighed as I leaned forward and kissed her forehead. "I guess he's your age. I don't mean to say sorry. I'm an old man, and I'm just an old fart. I could probably have you do some sort of service, but that's as far as I'm willing to go. Besides, it's just sex."</p> <p>She smiled and leaned back on her elbow. "That's a good point. I can't explain it, but you've gotten older. I just hope that I can still love you, still see you in the same light, after you're gone."</p> <p>"I guess that's true in this case," I said. "I can't go around saying I'm either glad that you're around or sad that you're gone. I've always felt there was more to the past couple of years than I was willing to admit." I leaned over and kissed her forehead again. "But, even if I can love you, don't expect to get back with anyone." I stood up from the bed and grabbed my pack and left the room.</p> <p>I was still laying on the bed, trying to sort out what I was going to tell Sheri and trying to decide if I would tell her. I had just settled into a little more relaxed state of mind when the doorbell rang. My mind was in an fog of confusion. What would she do if that person walked in on us naked? That I had just made love with a girl? If I opened the door right now she would have a choice between me leaving her alone or staying, or just going downstairs and going to my room and doing what I was feeling I just did.</p> <p>I glanced over at the door to see if it opened, and as it opened, there stood Sheri. She saw me standing there and leaned forward. "Are you okay?" She asked.</p> <p>I nodded. "I came to say goodbye," I said. "That's all. I guess the little talk I've been planning hasn't gone smoothly. I'm tired." So I really did need to rest. I needed too rest.</p> <p>"Why didn't you just leave?" She asked.</p> <p>"I can't say I was happy when I left." I stood there and took a couple of deep breaths, trying to settle my nerves enough to get some semblance of control.</p> <p>"But you didn't. I just needed some time away from all of this." Sheri took a deep breath and walked towards me. "If you'd had time, would you still be here? I know we wouldn't be here right now, but I'd like you to meet me right?"</p> <p>I nodded. "It's nice to meet you." I kissed her forehead. "Besides, what harm could it do? I'm sure there's plenty of room for us to talk."</p> <p>She leaned back and took another step towards the door. "You're right," she said, "I'm still going to have to tell you the whole story because I wanted to hear it myself. If you want to hear the part of me that's hiding that part in all of this, just go ahead and hear it. When I think about it, a million times I'm going to want to tell you."</p> <p>I smiled and stepped closer to her until our bodies were close. "I'm going to try to keep this between us," I said. "And I need to tell you that I am really sorry that I didn't come to your room to let you know what I felt."</p> <p>She smiled. "You didn't come over because you were afraid that I'd leave you."</p> <p>I shook my head. "That's fine. I was trying to let you know that I didn't mean to cause you any trouble."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," she said. "I knew why you hadn't come over when you thought it was okay, because I've gotten used to it by now, and I'm not even sure you didn't mean for it to happen, or if you'd wanted to have sex with me. I'm going to have to find out the hard way."</p> <p>I looked at her for a long moment, and then looked away when she made a move to push me away. "You're going to have to tell me where to find a phone to call you. That's about all the time we have left in the world. And besides, I would hate to put any time in one of those calls, if there were going to be any time left. I'm tired of your kind of teasing, and I'm starting to get tired of being the other half of someone that needs to think."</p> <p>In one quick movement, she took my hand and placed it on her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
