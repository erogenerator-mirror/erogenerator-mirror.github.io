You were so turned on that you almost did yourself over the head of the neighbor while I was sitting on them, both of us feeling the pleasures of our own coupling ... but that was mostly just me! You had no idea what that actually was."</p> <p>"Well, maybe it wasn't so bad though," I replied.</p> <p>"Not at all," she replied, "but I was hoping it might be."</p> <p>"I know, I know - it's different right now," I said without meaning to.</p> <p>"What?" she asked, surprised.</p> <p>"Well, if we did do it, there was no stopping us," I said again.</p> <p>"That's OK with me?" she asked, "it was better this way. Do I really have to call my parents to let them know?"</p> <p>"No, I don't think either is going to be able to stop you, especially from where you've got my phone," I replied.</p> <p>"What if your parents weren't home? Is that what you want me to do?" she asked, her face still on the edge of a flush and her nipples clearly visible through her thin blouse.</p> <p>"They might be asleep by now, but you can take a chance," I continued, "if they don't go into your house right before they go to get something to eat and a change of clothes and then it won't even matter."</p> <p>"OK," she said, turning to me again, "if you want, I'd be more than happy to do it."</p> <p>"I'll call your parents after you call and get a good night's sleep, just to let them know that you've had fun, not to worry ... and then we'll see if anything has come up," I suggested.</p> <p>She stood up and turned around. "You've got to be kidding," she said, "I did have fun!"</p> <p>"No, you're right," I said, "and I really needed to get a hold of you so that I could tell you all about it. I think I might let you do things with me in the future, if you're ok with it. "</p> <p>She was standing in front of me by the sofa armchair, her legs slightly apart ... still holding her skirt up in her lap. I reached out and cupped her left breast with my left hand, lightly pinching her nipple between thumb and forefinger, sending tingles up and down her spine. She was still holding her blouse closed and she leaned forward, her right hand reaching down to grasp the hem of my shirt as I pulled it over my head. "Let me help you find your slacks," she said, "but if you don't mind I'm going to do something else ... do you think you'll like it if I slip out of them and undress you?</p> <p>"No, of course not," I replied. "I really like it," I said, reaching around to unfasten her skirt, hooking my fingers in the waistband and pulling it down. I pulled it off her hips and off her legs ... leaving her standing with her bare feet still on the sofa and the hem of her blouse held together by her hand. She didn't say anything else - but her eyes were locked on mine as I took in my reflection before taking off my shirt. There was something about how she stared at my body, the way she seemed to be drinking in it every time she looked at my body.</p> <p>I turned around and faced her again. I was a bit taller than she was - maybe six foot or so - and my arms looked kind of soft and well-shaped. Her eyes were watching my body as she reached out her hand to encircle my shaft, feeling it grow again under her touch. Her hand was warm and soft and warm and it felt quite nice to have at last her hand. I felt like a teenager again, the same way she did, but at the same time quite different. It was almost as if we were doing the same kind of sex thing, except that it all got a little more intense. Maybe it was the fact that she was almost completely naked, almost as if I was somehow the object, but perhaps more of a connection to my new body. Maybe it was because I had been the object in my own body for the last few years - and somehow it made me feel good to have at least a little of that feeling to bring me to orgasm.
