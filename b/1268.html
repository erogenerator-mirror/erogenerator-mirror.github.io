Both hands massaging my arms, pulling me up onto the bed, pushing me until I collapsed onto it.</p> <p>Her face was only inches from mine and I found myself looking at her. Her hands were on my stomach and I could feel that she was touching something else...something I could not see. Something that I could not imagine, though. I could only assume she was rubbing one of her hands across my chest. When I finally looked down I saw that she was no longer holding the bikini top, but instead was kneading two of her fingers across my nipples making them stiff as rocks.</p> <p>"I love how you're reacting to this." Her voice dripped with a sensual tone as she looked down, "I can't believe you're even wearing something this sexy..."</p> <p>I nodded and her eyes drifted down to where they rested on my crotch. I was already beginning to get hard as the blood coursed through my groin and I knew that if I did not stop myself soon we wouldn't be able to take our eyes off of each other. As if that was even possible, her eyes followed that path down as she slowly slid it off of my body. I tried to keep a straight face as I stared up at the beautiful sight of her eyes on mine. Her gaze kept moving lower, lower and lower till she came to rest right on the lower part of my cock.</p> <p>"You're hard for me." She teased, "Don't tell me you can't take some more of it."</p> <p>I tried to look away, but the movement forced my eyes to focus on the two women on the bed. The woman in question was one of Anna's best friends and her head was thrown back, her eyes closed slightly and her mouth opened slightly in a sexy smile of ecstasy. I looked around nervously, wondering what would happen to me if I was discovered. But the woman next to me leaned down and began kissing her way slowly down my stomach, her hand continuing to play over my body. When I looked down I saw the woman’s hand was working down my body, moving over the top of my cock, lightly touching down to my balls and up again to the tip. She kept at this until the head of my cock was firmly planted between her thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>She was pulling away, just long enough to say, "My friend is going to love seeing the look on your face when I do those things."</p> <p>And then she slipped the bikini top back over her breasts and began the process again. Her breasts were very perky as she stood up and slipped back onto the bed. She was still lying on her stomach and her ass was very attractive, round and tight. I began to get hard when she reached between my legs and began stroking my cock. I tried to close my eyes just to enjoy the feeling, but then I was able to turn my head and see the other girls lying on the bed, one of them being equally sensuous on her side. I noticed that it was now getting light outside and knew that Anna would be asleep by now.</p> <p>The woman next to me had moved over slowly to lie next to me and she was gently running her fingers along my body, massaging my body. The woman now in front of me had moved her lips down to my chest and began to kiss and suck the very center of the inside of each of my breasts. I knew that if this was the same woman I knew I would not be able to keep my eyes open very long and it was when the woman took my other nipple into her mouth that I looked down to see her head begin to move. When she switched to the other breast she continued to suck and lick at my hardened nipple and as she did this a low moan came from my lips. The woman began to moan too and her hand began to rub across my stomach and her other hand was now sliding up and under me until she was rubbing my navel through the material of the bikini.</p> <p>I began to try to make myself focus on the woman on the bed and soon I found I was staring directly into Anna's eyes. She was gazing at me with an intensity like she was seeing that same intensity in the dark as her friend and I had just seen in the dark. I was in a state of shock, but then I felt her fingers on my cock, the soft fingers moving up to my cock. Her other hand had moved down and was massaging my balls and she was now rubbing the tip of my cock to the base. I could feel it begin to pulse and feel her smile as she rubbed my cock and it grew in her hand. My hands moved to explore her breasts as she continued to rub me. When I had finally decided to look around I found myself staring at the other girls lying on their backs, Anna still between them.</p> <p>I moved slowly to—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
