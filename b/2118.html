"Harder! Harder!" she urged, knowing it would drive him over the edge.</p> <p>He thrust even more urgently now, his balls slapping against her clit. His breathing became raspy, shallow and strained... She felt it, felt his thick cock jerked inside her, felt his hot sperm squirting up into her belly. The intensity increased almost to the point of exhaustion and she slumped back on his strong chest, sobbing softly. His lips were on hers in a soft kiss. She felt her heart and soul return to normal and she relaxed back on the hardwood floor.</p> <p>He raised his head and looked down at her. He smiled at her, running his fingers through her hair.</p> <p>"That was incredible. I've never done that before," he admitted, as if it were a simple statement.</p> <p>"Me neither."</p> <p>They both laughed and he wrapped his arms around her. She leaned back against him. He held her, squeezing her breasts. She felt her heart beating a little faster in appreciation for being able to do that. He kissed her neck as she held him. He ran his fingers down her back, caressing and pressing them between her ass cheeks. They smiled and he gently rolled her onto her back.</p> <p>She felt some sort of pressure at the small of her back, but she didn't fight it, merely enjoying being used as his plaything. She stretched out her arms above her head and she pulled herself up to a sitting position on the floor. He lay there and looked at her.</p> <p>"Don't think that's all you've got," he said.</p> <p>His big hand cupped her cheek as he gave her a long kiss. His fingertips tickled her nose. He looked into her eyes and smiled.</p> <p>"I know that you've got a lot left in your system now," he told her. "But as beautiful as you are, I'm sure you'll be a better lover in a few years."</p> <p>He turned her head toward him and kissed her once more. She accepted it, as she always did with him. He held his hand out between them. And then she reached toward his cock. He took it out of her hand and she wrapped her hand around it and he slid it along the length of his shaft and felt it. It was huge. Her hand didn't meet around it, but he could feel it. Her fingers closed around just the girth of his cock as she guided it up and down, as if on a string. She began working it with her hand as she gazed into his eyes.</p> <p>"You've got such a big cock," she said dreamily.</p> <p>He took her by the shoulder and turned her over on her chest. She lay with her legs bent and her legs parted. She felt him climb onto the floor, his hands caressing her back. He knelt there and kissed and licked her neck and shoulders until her mouth opened and her hips began moving. He took turns kissing and licking her down to her waist.</p> <p>"You have a great ass." he said, feeling it in his hands and mouth. "You always get my cock so wet." He rolled it out from her body and then back in again and again.</p> <p>She arched her hips up, offering herself to him. She knew what was coming now and she wanted it. She wanted it so badly she could taste it, feel it. For as long as they could get away with it.</p> <p>Her hands went to his thighs and began kneading them in a circle. She moaned with pleasure as her fingers found his balls and began rolling them around. She couldn't stop herself from pulling on them, but it only made him move further onto the floor. Still on all fours, he began working his way up her back, his hand still stroking and squeezing the big cock.</p> <p>It was the most delightful sensation she'd ever known. Even though she was only a girl, he had something special all around, including her own cunt, which felt so good.</p> <p>She lifted one leg over his shoulder, bringing his face even closer to her. He felt her cunt lips begin to throb and stretch, as he began sucking on her clit. She cried out, and he kissed her as well as her stomach.</p> <p>"Suck my cock, slut!" he ordered.</p> <p>She felt her cunt spasm and then he slid it all the way into her, until she felt his pubic hair tickling her ass cheeks as they met. Then he pulled out slowly and he felt him's penis throbbing and sliding up and up, sliding right up to the head. Then, just as it was coming to the point of no return, he plunged all the way in once, driving all the way to the root in one motionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
