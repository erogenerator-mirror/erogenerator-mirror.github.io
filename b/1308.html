Then both of us smile at the same time. Then you lean your hands forward, and place them on my arms, just below my breasts. You feel me quiver at the moment when our hands come together and we kiss.</p> <p>I reach for your cock.</p> <p>I slowly stroke your cock to the sound of your breathing and the feeling of your hand. I turn you around. My fingers come up. I stroke the shaft back and forth, with both of my fingers around the head of your cock. My fingers circle your cock head before rubbing it between my fingers. The skin is stretched, and the tip of your dick slides out of my hand.</p> <p>I turn around to face you. I stroke your cock again. I stroke it on all sides, around, and around. With my fingers on the other side, I can feel the skin on your cock stretch, and your tip slip in and out of my fingers as I go up and down.</p> <p>We turn so that you can take a nipple into your mouth. You take it into your mouth, licking and sucking on it, teasing it with your teeth. Your hands slide around to my pussy, and you touch it, to which I moan.</p> <p>I pull my breasts away from you, out, away from you, out of your reach. I grab your cock, and place it at the opening of my lips, as you push yourself into my mouth. Your cock slides into my warm mouth. I keep sucking and sliding it in, up and down, with your hands in my hair. My mouth starts to move slowly, but with your cock thrusting in and out of my mouth. I feel you going in and out, deeper and deeper, as my lips go up and down in time to your cock and my hand moves around your cock, on the outside.</p> <p>I pull your cock away from my lips and move it to the other corner of my mouth, where I use my tongue to lick it lightly. As I do this, I continue to take your cock out of my mouth so I can take the saliva that has built up from the saliva, and let it run down my neck and down my breasts.</p> <p>Your cock comes almost all the way out of my mouth, then pushes back between my lips. Your cum shoots out, and all over my tongue and into my open mouth. I swallow, then clean your cock with my mouth, which leaves my lips and cheek to drip some of your cum onto my lips, chin and cheek. I lean forward and kiss you softly, then again, my lips caressing your lips with mine.</p> <p>You put your hand on my pussy, and with just the tips of your fingers, you start to rub it. I moan into your mouth. Your thumb finds my clit, and you massage it, sending me off into oblivion, your cock in my mouth.</p> <p>You pull your cock out of my mouth, then lay down next to me. You kiss me on the lips, then my chin, my neck, my breasts, my nipples, my stomach. You roll me over so that I'm on the edge of the bed. You slide yourself underneath of me, and with one quick motion, you bury yourself into my pussy.</p> <p>My legs wrap around you, and I move my hips up and down, feeling like a cock buried in my pussy, only for you to move around, but not moving. You don't take your cock out of my pussy long, just a couple of short minutes, then you are back deep inside of me again.</p> <p>You pull my legs from around your body, and I wrap them around your waist. We fuck each other like an animal, moving faster and faster. Our bodies are tight. My arms and legs are around you, my arms and hands around you. You feel your balls tighten. I feel as you thrust into me. You want to come. We are together. We want to come together. We know this.</p> <p>Our bodies become still, our eyes locked on one another. We have no control.</p> <p>We're not talking anymore.</p> <p>We have known one another forever.</p> <p>We are still together.</p> <p>We are not talking anymore.</p> <p>We don't need words, just bodies connecting through the other.</p> <p>We make our bodies cum together with each other.</p> <p>We can't tell one another, our eyes do not see one another. We only experience each other.</p> <p>We are fucking each other through every last movement, and every last touch.</p> <p>Just as we can stand no more, we climax together, your seed flying into me as I cum with you, your cock shooting semen into me.</p> <p>The first waveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
