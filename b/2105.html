I'm getting a bit carried away there," I said to him.</p> <p>"It was fucking amazing, honey," he grinned back. "I can't imagine it being any better in bed with you."</p> <p>I could feel my lips turn into a smirk as I thought he was going to explode on me in one of these long hot summer nights. He looked at me as he lifted the pillow from the bed. "Don't worry about it, babe. I'm not going to be that long without you, so we can move on to something else." It turned me on for sure. It felt like a long time until I could cum again, but I was too spent to worry about that right then.</p> <p>He leaned down over me and kissed me long and hard. I could taste myself on him. "I'm not sure how I feel about this. You are so sweet. And you're so damn good. I've never had anything that I could call a lover before. How long has it been since you've even held hands with someone?" He asked me softly and I looked at him in surprise.</p> <p>He reached up and gently squeezed my cheek as he replied. "You're my one and only. I don't want to hurt you at all. I love you. I want to be with you."</p> <p>I was speechless for a minute. But then the question in my own voice came to me. "I don't know if I can give you more than that, Robbie. I don't have that same love for you."</p> <p>"It's what you said, honey. I was just going to be blunt about that. You're a very special girl and I'll always have you as a friend," he said as he kissed me. I kissed him back. "Besides, you are the most special girl I've ever had and you are so fucking gorgeous, honey."</p> <p>The next thing I knew his whole body was on top of me. He kissed my collarbone and worked his way up to my neck. He took my chin and turned it upwards so that I was looking at his amazing blue eyes as they stared straight into mine. I could tell that he had just been waiting for my response. And his expression was so captivating. It was a look of absolute adoration and love, in a way that I couldn't describe. That's where I thought he wanted me to look for some time.</p> <p>My tongue found some kind of taste inside his mouth. He moaned as my tongue ran over it, causing it to become even bigger. He moved his head and kissed me very sweetly but firmly. It tasted like cherries as it slid between my lips. We kissed for what seemed an eternity as he kissed his way down my neck to my breasts. His hand was still buried in my pussy and it was all I could do to not moan too loudly at the contact.</p> <p>His fingers teased my pussy as his tongue stroked over my hard swollen nipples. I could feel the muscles in my body starting to contract as he continued to use his mouth to tease me. He lifted my right breast and leaned down over me to suck my nipple into his mouth. He kissed his way south as he went down on his knees. It was a moment I'll never forget. It was that special moment that every man has and that makes me want to give myself to him so that he can make me feel that way again when we make love.</p> <p>I lifted my hands up to caress his head as he went over my breasts. I could feel his warm breath washing over me as he continued to suck on my breasts and lick my nipples. With one leg in between his, I felt his cock pushing into me, and I knew what I felt and what I wanted in him. It felt as though my wetness was actually pouring out of my pussy down between my legs and making his rock hard cock feel amazing. I couldn't have done that any other way.</p> <p>He kissed his way back up my neck to my mouth. Our tongues played together as I could taste myself on him. I could taste my juice on his cock and on my own pussy.</p> <p>He turned me over on the bed so that I was laying on my back. He kissed his way down my body as he continued to tease my pussy with the tip of his tongue. I was already wet with anticipation and he knew it. His tongue flicked my clit while the tip of his tongue ran down my stomach to my inner thighs. I moaned a little in pure pleasure but knew he had to be aware of my response to him this time.</p> <p>His lips moved up and down over my pussy lips, causing them to tingle with every movement. He moved his tongue over me as he slid his right hand upward to tease my nipple. He took his left hand around to cup my breast while he continued to tease my wet pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
