I got the mail and was still wondering about what I had seen in the mail box and what it might say when I got home. I sat in the living room and read through mail and came to the conclusion that the mail box was for me. I looked through it again. I then tried reading a copy of the letter that one of the girls on the board of directors sent to me. I knew it was important, but I couldn't help but think I would get a message that if it were to be carried out they had to get married, so I kept at it. I read a letter from Tom and I decided to mail the letter back after we had made love. On the way home I received the latest copy of the letter from Tom. I looked at it again. I opened it and read it.</p> <p>My heart sank a little as he wrote the letter. He said he had read the letter one week ago and the time frame had been a complete mistake for a husband, not a son. I wondered if he had heard it or not but decided I would just keep it one thing, and hope, that it was a mistake.</p> <p></p> <p>Dear Tom,</p> <p></p> <p>I am sorry to have to tell you so soon, but in the last six months I noticed that the other wives on the old bed in my bed were very unhappy and just the thought of you being with them bothered me so I thought it made me feel better, so I decided to move on and see if this was the type of husband that would be good for me and give me a little time on the side. I will make my intentions plain and if you are ever tempted you always have to do the right thing by yourself, so if you do have the nerve to be with me I would be happy to go away. Of course there was the possibility that if I was to bring my wife along again or if she came to my home I would just not mention it anymore.</p> <p></p> <p>There were so many things to contemplate with this letter. On one hand, did I keep it in the envelope and then have her meet me in the living room after we had made love? On the other hand I thought it would be nice to have another female in the bed that I could fuck, but in reality only if she wanted to make love with me. I was worried that if she saw what I had been reading and found I had been reading it once a week that she would find it strange but that would be a start, but I think it's better that I keep it in. As for her, I don't know if I will be seeing her again, but it will be my best bet not to make that issue of marriage to her. I know I will not be sleeping with her again, but at least I won't have to go through the "unpleasant" details of our marriage every day, so don't worry.</p> <p>When I got home I found the letter had arrived. I opened it up and saw a couple of pictures, mostly of some young guy with a big cock. I picked up the message. It read:</p> <p>My name is Tom and the wife and I was hoping to meet you after our sex life has passed a little. We have both had a few dates before your company came to our house, but we were both young enough to be your son and I had a boy friend. There is no way I am going to marry you either. To my best friends of course, but I guess you really don't have to have a boy over now do you? If you don't like it I won't get mad and you can always call me.</p> <p>Tom</p> <p>I didn't really hear what he said. I was reading through it and it came out as though he had been listening. I opened it and there wasn't much in it. There was a picture of an eighteen-year-old girl with no underwear on and then was my beautiful little friend with his cock in her mouth. I didn't see in his face that he had moved, so I assumed it wasn't anything unusual. There were five more pictures with him on the other side of the camera and I was starting to wonder if he was really as good with his camera as I thought he had been with his cock out. I wondered if he even had a dick in his mouth. It took me a couple of minutes to realize his picture had been in the frame, and then I was thinking that he must have taken the picture of him sucking my son. When he saw me looking at his picture he stood up and said:</p> <p>"Well did you like that one?"</p> <p>I looked at his picture. It had been on my hand in my room so I could look at it as I was masturbating and felt a warmth deep down in my loins, but I didn't seem to know what to think. I just stared for a few seconds and then Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
