He would not call.</p> <p>I found out he was gay. The guy at the strip club? I had never met him, but the picture he sent was pretty hot! I had my own picture of him in "The Last Chance" and had no idea what the fuck he looked like. It did not take me long to figure out he was at the club with his friend Tom, and I did. It was really neat to meet a guy that I was almost willing to sleep with but my "favoring" Tom's dick was more of a turn on. My eyes kept going back and forth between him and my "wife" as I thought of her. I kept trying to convince myself we were not actually fucking and if I was that I might get a chance to "watch" Tom the couple of times we would go out to dinner then he and heer, "date" me at the bar!</p> <p>Tom never seemed to go out with me, and I was never really with him again. I don't know if we ever did more than get a few drinks and then we would usually end up in the same bed. By that time I had had more than my share of "hobby" and I had started feeling "silly" too. "Honey" would call around 3AM and I'd spend the night at his house. As usual he would never say anything but it was obvious we did "do this, because it worked!"</p> <p>On one Friday night when I didn't have Tom I thought "I know he's gay, and I think that if he was in with the gay part of the party he could sleep on the couch. I thought about how great a night of sex with a "favoring" guy was going to be, and decided to take the risk anyway!</p> <p>I called a few nights ago and asked him to have dinner on Thursday to come over there Friday evening. Tom was on duty at 6:00PM and I wondered if he would be dressed for the evening. I figured he would have some clean, white shirt and a pair of pants that fit loosely and he would be ready to go by 6:00PM.</p> <p>Tom: "What the hell" I thought? I don't want to fuck him until he thinks I'm ready for him. I thought, then "What in the world is he gonna do?" He called a long time ago but I got that message right from him.</p> <p>Tom: "Hello? Is this a good time? I was wondering if you could come over."</p> <p>I was not to be disappointed. I had been calling "Hi" all evening and the voice on the phone was a different voice. It was not his voice. It was someone else's. The voice was different too. I said, to myself, "It must be him! He has told me so much about me. I just don't know him." I had to get a little more to the point. I was not sure what I was going to say but I had to find out! I asked him to make the day and I would be there.</p> <p>I called Tom and the conversation didn't take long. We talked for about ten minutes and then he suggested maybe 10:00PM. "Why don't we go a little early? I can get away from work early and watch the movie on HBO tonight!"</p> <p>I smiled and said, "Yeah, go ahead, get me a beer and we can hit the sack!"</p> <p>I ended up going to the local movie theater that was a couple of blocks away and the rest of the way out we made a pact not to mention anything to my "beth" or my "beth" at the end of the evening. We found a movie that had a good storyline and the movie had some nudity and we had some sex play play out. By one o'clock in the afternoon Tom was ready to call it a night!</p> <p>Tom: "Come on! Let's make my date night."</p> <p>I said, "OK, but I don't want my wife to be so horny by the time we get back to our room!"</p> <p>Tom laughed and said, "I just had a call from an investigator last week!"</p> <p>We talked some more and then he said, "So tonight is it?"</p> <p>I looked at him and said, "I suppose", and we laughed.</p> <p>That evening when we got home I had a hard time sleep because it was all I could think about. He had left some sexy photos of me on the table in the den. While he was there, I went in the bathroom and put on the lingerie I had bought and when I finished my hair I looked in the mirror and realized I looked pretty good at 42. I looked and felt real good. I just love makeup, don'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
