We were alone. Then the woman told her we would be the parents and that we would do anything to keep her. She was right. She always trusted me. Then she left.</p> <p>I knew it was fate. Not to be married to a slut, or even if they were, but to be alone. I was alone there too. The last time I had been alone and out of my mind with sexual thoughts I had felt guilty.</p> <p>This time I decided to keep my life. It was like I was getting a present made after the wedding. I would be a free agent. I had no one or nothing. As I walked into the house, I felt so happy. I was so happy that the woman knew it was me.</p> <p>The first thing I noticed in this home was furniture. All of it was new and beautiful. We had only four bedrooms. The living room, kitchen, and dining room had been moved into the master bedroom. I felt a sense of déjà vu. I couldn't keep my hands off of my new wife. All of my hopes and dreams were now realized.</p> <p>That night we had sex. No other lovers. We would have sex all weekend but we didn't have sex. But as we got into it we could feel sexual tension in our bodies.</p> <p>After a while I told her what I was doing. She didn't know what was going on. I wanted to stop before we left. Then I went into the bathroom to get rid of all of my clothes. I started the shower and told the wife we would stop anytime they wanted to shower. We were alone but we knew we were together and I wanted her to be with me for as long as I told her.</p> <p>When I stepped into the shower, it went on for about ten minutes. I felt so warm. Then I felt wetness. I knew it was going to be me on the bed, on all fours, in the bedroom.</p> <p>The shower door opened, "Are you ready for another drink?" I walked into the bathroom, "Do you want me in your bedroom?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>I went into the bedroom, my body still soaking wet from our lovemaking. I took my boxers off. I stripped off my shirt and shorts. I had never looked in the mirror. I looked at my body and my new body. I looked young and young beautiful. After I was sure the baby, so my wife, and family were safe, I got onto the bed.</p> <p>I had my legs open so invitingly. I was so ready I could barely get my fingers to open the lips of my pussy. I took my finger and slid it in and out of me. I took my finger out. I looked at my finger with my cum covered face and I smiled.</p> <p>"Baby, can I suck it please?" I looked over at the wet spot as I licked my finger clean.</p> <p>I saw a smile and a nod. Then I went back into the bathroom and took off all my clothes.</p> <p>As I went down on her I asked, "Is the baby you were talking about?"</p> <p>"He has a fat belly." I didn't stop. "I'm not on the pill. If I take birth control, I can still have sex and I'm ovulating." We had already talked about getting married when she told me it was for me. So why, then, did she agree to let me take the baby.</p> <p>I crawled onto the bed. My pussy was so wet it covered the sheets. I spread my legs and then I started to rub myself with my other hand. I pulled on one of my nipples while I watched her. Our bodies moved against each other. I reached down and started to play with my clit again. She looked at me again and moaned.</p> <p>We both stopped for a moment. I looked at her. She smiled and then I said, "I didn't think you wanted me to."</p> <p>"I'm fine." My hands went to stroke her hair and then to her breasts.</p> <p>We kissed again. For so long I was thinking about how much I wanted to taste her. I kissed my way down to her breast, taking it into my mouth and sucking her hard nipple. My tongue worked her nipple. I rubbed between my thumb and forefinger on each breast, feeling the soft skin under the tips. She was moaning and her breathing was getting faster.</p> <p>I rolled her nipple between my fingers and I started to roll my tongue around her hard little nub. My other hand worked itself around her body as I found my way down to her cunt. Her legs spread even wider than before. I slid my fingers up and down and around her soaking wet clit.
