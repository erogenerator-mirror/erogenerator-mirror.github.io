It just makes me feel so wickedly horny, and that girl can fuck me anytime she wants!" she replied.</p> <p>"Yes, I know. I always get horny," I grinned; "I need to feel good though," and I bent over her and started to lick her pussy, moving my tongue in and out.</p> <p>"Don't forget about me," she murmured; "I like it too, don't I? And I love your tongue on my pussy, too," and she kissed me again, pulling me in her arms. We fell on the bed, naked and exhausted, and fell asleep that way.</p> <p>I'm not sure if I woke up when I felt a hand slip inside my shorts, touching my very gently. In just a couple of hours it's going to get better, it wouldn't be long at all.</p> <p>* * * * * * *</p> <p>The next morning I was up to an alarm clock and the door opened at eleven in the morning and she was with her breakfast of coffee, toast and juice. We just sat and watched the news, chatting animatedly and talking about everything. When we had finished our breakfast she turned off the alarm and we put our clothes on, got into the car, and headed up the coast. It was already a beautiful day and I was looking forward to a nice hot swim on the island.</p> <p>When we got to her house I took her in for a swim, and we kissed as I held her bottom and fondled her bottom, then went upstairs to her bedroom.</p> <p>When we went inside she got on the bed, and started to undress my shirt, and then dropped her skirt to the floor. She pulled my undies down to the floor as I stood there and she sucked and licked my cock, then dropped those panties and went after me with her mouth.</p> <p>While she sucked my cock she started to finger her pussy, and after a couple of minutes she went down on me, taking me in her mouth.</p> <p>"I love your big hard cock," she sighed and then pulled it out of her mouth. She moved up onto my dick, and sank down on it. "That's it, lover, fuck yourself," she cooed as she started to raise and drop herself on my dick.</p> <p>We came together in a heap, and she was just as happy as I was as she kissed me and held me, and I held her as we climaxed together.</p> <p>Once we were done she went downstairs, and I dressed again and we sat on the sofa, naked and happy, and kissed and fondled each other. We said good morning and she went upstairs with me.</p> <p>I looked at her and thought for a few moments. Then I went to the door and opened it to see what she had on, and saw her naked, lying on the bed naked, still with clothes on. I knelt by the foot of the bed and kissed her good morning and told her how much I loved her, and she loved me too.</p> <p>She was just about to open her legs, when I looked and saw her hand coming out and stroking my cock. She looked up at me and smiled, and then opened her legs.</p> <p>I looked down at what her hand was doing as she started to masturbate me, and she moved her mouth over my cock while she played me with her hands and fingers.</p> <p>"Oooh," she murmured as she took me into her mouth and started to suck. It didn't take long. "Ahhh!" I cried out as I came. "Ahhhh!" And I spurted my juices into her mouth, and she swallowed and then she licked her lips and grinned.</p> <p>"You taste good," she said as she opened her mouth to show me how much she had got me. Then she closed her mouth over my cock once more, sucked until I was soft again and then got up off the bed.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" she asked and looked at me. "That was fantastic! It made me really horny when I came," she laughed.</p> <p>"It was wonderful, the sexiest stuff, the best and the best in a long time," I replied. She took me to bed and got in beside me and cuddled, which made me groan.</p> <p>"Why don't you lie down again, lover? I want to hold you again," she giggled, and she kissed my lips. "You taste nice," she said, "but I really want to do you some more." She reached between my legs and grasped my cock, then got up and lay beside me, still holding me. She started to kiss me, taking my cock in her hands and then kissing along it and then over it when I was hard again. I lay there enjoying her mouth and hands, and she kissed my armpitsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
