She placed her hand on his leg, he smiled and ran his hands over her ass. She looked back and pulled his mouth to hers and kissed him deeply before pulling back.</p> <p>"How was your night?" He asked</p> <p>"Oh great. Very busy..not sure where to start....not sure you remember."</p> <p>"I remember well, I just lost my virginity and I just enjoyed it," he said smiling</p> <p>"Good...I did too," she said, putting her hands over his, "now let's go for the walk," she said. Together they started toward the front of the hotel.</p> <p>She pulled out the walkway leading to the front desk and told them they could go to the lobby to get their bags and then she said,</p> <p>"I told you we had to change, take the elevator, follow me,"</p> <p>They started to walk down the elevator, she pressed the button for the 3rd floor and they were in each other's arms kissing again. She could feel his erection growing with her kiss.</p> <p>After they had walked to the desk her desk manager handed them both one of the rooms. She asked if he was still single and he said, "Yeah, not really." When she opened one of the rooms on his desk, she asked him for the room to park it for the hour and said she would find out where he wanted to go.</p> <p>It was nearly 9 when they were seated on his bed. As he was lying on the bed he told her he had missed her. She smiled and said she missed him too. When they got off the bed, she went to the door and closed it. He asked her if she had called her work and she said she had and she had to leave but she was on her way.</p> <p>She came back a few hours later and left a message telling her he didn't like leaving her alone. When he asked if she would be a lover again he mentioned it wasn't as bad as she thought it would be. She told him it wasn't a choice she made, she never had had to make the decision of how she wanted to be with a woman and he agreed. She told him she wished it would never have happened but at that time she just liked that she could enjoy her body.</p> <p>When they were back in her room she started by undressing but before lying down, she got on all fours and looked at herself in the mirror. She had a nice curvy body and a nice ass. She walked over to the nightstand and started taking out some perfume and when she smelled it, it was really very sexy. She applied some to her breasts and then went down to her pussy and started rubbing some around her slit. Then she felt her own nipples go erect and she told him to rub it all over her nipples.</p> <p>He moved around her and got between her legs. She could feel his large erection pressing against her ass as he rubbed it along her slit.</p> <p>"Mmm, it looks good enough to eat....I can't wait to have your cock in me...." She said as she pushed his head down to her pussy. He licked her for awhile before she pulled his head up to her lips and started kissing him.</p> <p>As he moved back up she got on her hands and knees and moved up to him. She told him to put his head in between her legs and she put her legs around his head and then pushed her pussy down in his face. This drove him even farther in her body and she started to get even wetter. He lapped at her pussy hungrily and then he started licked up and down her slit. She pushed his face hard against her so he had to hold on to keep it there.</p> <p>She then stood up and pushed his face into her again and got on top of him again and pushed his legs back to his chest and started moving her hips against him.</p> <p>"Fuck me....fuck me," she said. He just nodded and moved his hips faster against her.</p> <p>"I love your cock," she said. She stopped for a second and turned around, looking deep into his eyes and said, "Fuck me doggie style." She pushed his face back into her pussy a little harder this time and then she started moving against him once more.</p> <p>She kept it up until he was almost to the point of coming but then she stopped and said, "Let's go to the shower. I want your cock in me again, but I want to fuck it first,"</p> <p>They took the shower and both washed each other down and then they took one of the towels and dried each other off before she turned in the shower and said, "I want one of your cocks in meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
