Because you're afraid to ask?" she asked with a scowl.</p> <p>"It's no big deal," I said, taking her hand. "Just don't get me mixed in with the entire town."</p> <p>"It's no big deal," she said, finally releasing my hand. "You do whatever you want to me. No-one will say you're gay."</p> <p>She turned around to see if anybody was looking in the window, and she just smiled at me. "If anyone sees you doing that to me, I'll just laugh it off."</p> <p>"You're funny," I said, "and I don't care. You got any idea how to get to my house and do what you want."</p> <p>"No, I don't," she said with a shrug, and I could imagine, out in the middle of this town getting a good fucking. I was a little worried for me, but when we were in the car we'd never stop talking about where we were going to get to my house. "Just keep me by your side, please."</p> <p>I had my eyes glued to her ass as she drove down the road. She was just wearing a tiny skirt with sandals. She didn't have any shoes on as well, but I figured she was going to be wearing heels anyway anyway. We had to go around to my front, though. It was about a quarter to six when we got there and we had to stand in front of my house. As she unlocked the front door, she leaned over my dresser to open our drawers and pulled out a tube of lubricant. She looked at it then back at me again.</p> <p>"Get into bed," she commanded. I sat on the bed and opened the drawer. "There's plenty of space over here," she went on, "and you'll have plenty of time to get fucked, too." She grabbed the tube and squirted a dollop into her hand. "You're going to love this, too, little girl," she told me. I sat up and we embraced. We kissed passionately and I tasted something salty on her tongue. I kissed her lower lip, then pulled away.</p> <p>She pulled back again, smiling. "You're very sweet." She handed me a condom, then knelt and took it off the table from around our ankles. "You're going to be all fucked up, baby," she said. "I'll take care of you." Then she knelt and took off her clothes as well. There wasn't any hurry as we were both ready to go. I was going in and out of her like she was a jackhammer, and she was loving it.</p> <p>"Oh honey," she gasped. "I can't believe that you did that! All of that cum is still inside of me! Oh!"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said with a grin, "you're so tight!" I couldn't help it, it was funny to see her smile. "You're still so fucking tight, baby. Are you still a virgin?"</p> <p>"I'm just not sure if it's possible," she said. "But yes, you're still technically a virgin."</p> <p>"Are we about to start this way?" I asked.</p> <p>Her face relaxed and she smiled again. "Yes," she said. "Do you think I can get pregnant?"</p> <p>"A virgin never talks with the mouth," I told her, "even when he's been with a woman before." I pulled out of her and pulled her to me. She laid on her back on the bed with her head hanging over the edge. I straddled the back of the bed and looked down at how her hair was spread out around her. "You're beautiful," I told her.</p> <p>"Thank you," she whispered.</p> <p>Once again I lowered myself onto her beautiful pussy and immediately began moving my hips against hers. I began stroking her thighs and moving her hair out of my way. She was moaning and breathing hard. I knew she wanted me to do this, so I moved my hips a bit and slowly ran them over both her inner thighs and the outside of her pussy. Her hands were going crazy around my back. "Mmmm, yes," she moaned. I took that as my cue, and increased the speed and force of my stroking of her. She wrapped her legs around my ass.</p> <p>It didn't take long before I was grunting and groaning and I knew I was going to cum inside of her. I could feel my head start to throb from the intense stimulation of her pussy around me. I pulled out slightly and aimed it at her head and she began moving her head around in short little motions as she came. With the intensity of it, her orgasm seemed to last forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
