It's my first story, and I hope you like it! Please check out the other stories in the series for a brief summary of my short story, "The Night and Life of a Nude Day Sister". Hope you like it! I am also a very passionate writer, and I have also recently published a novel in a series titled "Wicked Nude Nude Nude". I am a published writer and am currently writing a novel titled 'It's a New Life" on Nude Day. I hope you find this story intriguing, and would like to see it published. I do apologize for the amount of readers who read the other versions of the series, but I am working on another series, and will submit to Literotica soon. I would greatly appreciate it if you could review some of the other stories I have based on Michelle's story.

It takes a lot of work to get an "acceptable" rating.</p> <p>******************** ****************************</p> <p>It was the fifth period in the eighth period at school. The first two periods were the same kind of school year. It was one of those days where a majority of kids in the class were students of the same age they had been at that particular school year.</p> <p>I remember the moment the bell rang and it was the biggest test of the day! I thought to myself that it was going to be a huge day, and wondered whether it would be any less than what it was going to get, after the bell rang. It was then that I remembered what went by the locker room last year. I had been looking for it when a few of my old classmates had come in for gym class. I was really hoping that there would be another gym class to use. Maybe my old girlfriends had found that locker room.</p> <p>Just as the class about to begin, I was walking behind an older man on the basketball court, trying to memorize every feature of this man’s face, when I spotted his locker right on the far corner of the building. I was not disappointed, not at all. He was an absolutely drop dead gorgeous man! I guess I could start at that point.</p> <p>His name was Jeffery Johnson, and he was the basketball team's first male basketball star. We all called him Billy Billy. He came over to me in the changing room and looked me over like I was a piece of candy or a piece of paper. We exchanged polite, yet knowing smiles and it was obvious that all this was a big deal.

Although the shirt had a good amount of cleavage under it, and just enough for most of the guys to get a glimpse of. There was a clear bulge running in the middle of the waistline of his uniform shirt. I found myself wondering just what other girls had to like about him. Maybe the uniform would only get better later!</p> <p>As my mind began racing with the possibility of being naked in front of this guy, I suddenly stopped counting the minutes. It couldn't have been more than an hour. Now, in addition to the fact that we had a whole team of young male athletes that had all gotten to practice the game in our school gym, we were still celebrating the victory of the game over the past several years.</p> <p>Jeffery looked up and smiled as he saw me standing there. I blushed realizing that he and I looked the same age, only now, there wasn't an inch of body that we could all tell. He also noticed that his eyes lingered a little too long on my chest which was barely covered by just a tiny bra. Not only was it a bit much to wear over my shirt and even without a bra I could tell that he was aroused in my view. It was not just those thoughts that were flashing through my mind.</p> <p>As I approached Jeffery, I let him feel my breast against his chest. He did not notice that I wasn't wearing a bra, as he was busy trying not to look at my cleavage. As I slowly drew closer to him I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
