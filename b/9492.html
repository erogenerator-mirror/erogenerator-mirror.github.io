Now," she said, taking his hand. "Do you want to feel my legs around your penis, boy?"</p> <p>"No, ma'am," he answered quickly.</p> <p>"Good boy! I like a nice boy who gets to experience a good sex, not a young child," she giggled.</p> <p>She turned around a bit and placed her knees on his left arm, leaning against the trunk of the car. She wrapped her warm wet legs with her hands and wrapped her arms around his body.</p> <p>"Oooh!" she moaned softly while kissing him deeply. He reached and gently pinched her left nipple while his right hand rubbed her pussy.</p> <p>"Do you want to cum inside me," she asked, kissing him deeply.</p> <p>"No...uh...yes...yes...yes...yes..." he moaned while rubbing his palm between her pussy lips while at the same time stroking her clit.</p> <p>"You're so naughty, Sir," she moaned, hugging him tight. "Your little girl loves this!"</p> <p>She pressed herself against his cock, guiding him into the wetness and pleasure her body. His head swam with the sensation. He knew he was close to a full-blown orgasm when she pushed against him.</p> <p>"Ah! Ah!" he groaned as he spurted his semen inside of her, holding his hand against her ass for all he was worth.</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"No, no, no," he told her. "You're much appreciated."</p> <p>"I'll be glad to, Sir," she cooed, sitting up on her knees and looking into his eyes.</p> <p>He kissed her gently on the lips and held her close.</p> <p>"So...you like me?" she asked, a bit apprehensively.</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am, very much."</p> <p>"Can we do this again...can I have any toys...or toys at all?"</p> <p>He smiled as he started the engine and pulled off the highway.</p> <p>They arrived at the park early and walked up to the building that housed the children's playground/bar. She had no toys, but he could have had her, he knew.</p> <p>"M-MASTER!" she called out, holding her handbag against her body.</p> <p>"Yes, slut?" he asked her.</p> <p>"I think maybe I can do it here," she said and held the door open for him.</p> <p>"Here?" he replied. "How do I get in? We're still on the highway."</p> <p>"No...don't worry about me...don't worry about anything...I just want to use you."</p> <p>He laughed then turned to enter the building.</p> <p>"Where are all of the other kids?" she asked, waving from her position behind the door.</p> <p>"Some kid saw me take off in back...and he couldn't understand why," he replied then went back his arm around her. "See you tomorrow, slut?"</p> <p>"Yeah...I will," she whispered softly.</p> <p>"Good...I have a surprise for you before you get back."</p> <p>He opened the door and stepped back. It was a very large and elaborate house. It looked to be over three hundred years old. The floor was covered in various pieces and they were all covered in various types of furniture, although there were a few pieces that looked more like old, metal tables or bowls than anything else. The walls also looked to be in use, however the carpet was a pale blue with many trees all over it. It looked like they had done a lot of planning, because the floors all came from logs and the floor was covered in a layer of pine and logs. The windows were a few inches in diameter and the top was filled with moss and thick bushes.</p> <p>"Do you like the place, Sir?" she asked as she handed him his bag.</p> <p>"I love it," he answered, looking around to let her know that the kids had arrived safely.</p> <p>"I know," she said. "See you tomorrow."</p> <p>"Yes, Mistress."</p> <p>"Good!" she smiled then went inside to take a shower. He followed just after she was gone.</p> <p>They entered into the kitchen and saw, in one corner of the room, a big kitchen. That was just a small kitchen.</p> <p>"Have I seen a dining table before?" he asked her.</p> <p>"No...I'm sorry," she answered nervously. "I didn't see what made me buy it, Sir."</p> <p>"I...didn't think you wanted to take a walk in the park," he said.</p> <p>"I didn't want to go anywhere, Sirâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
