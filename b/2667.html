I was the one you wanted to see me with. I had always thought that I looked like a very attractive blonde woman but I was in a hurry this time. If I could have gotten a good look at you, I would have liked your tits. You were a very nice looking woman. You had a great pair of legs, full, long, and perfectly shaped. I know that I looked at you for the first time when we got to the beach and you asked me to stay the weekend, just me and you. You were going to make us stay in hotel and you had no idea what could have brought that on. You got me the chance to spend the first weekend with you.</p> <p>You said, "We could talk a little but I would suggest going out to dinner, you always say how exciting it is to have a beautiful woman like you, even after all these years."</p> <p>"Oh I want you to stay."</p> <p>"We'll try to make it together. It wouldn't hurt too much to get together, we both like a good steak and wine."</p> <p>We got up and left the restaurant in only our bikinis. You looked like a very nice looking woman as we walked back to our beach shack. We chatted a bunch over the next several hours at the seafood restaurant. You could see that I had really appreciated the compliments on my body. When we got to our place, you told me to undress while you undressed. I sat up on the bed and we both stripped. I stood up and took off my bathers and put my arms underneath my body. You took your bathers off and walked over to me and put your hand on my mound. I spread my legs a little and you put your hand between me and stroked me a little. Your finger easily slipped inside me and you moved it around a little to gather a bit of my wetness. You then moved your finger tip to my clit. "Are you ready for this," you whispered to me. I looked at you and said yes. You just smiled and said that I was ready.</p> <p>You put your finger back down and put your mouth on my clit and sucked on it. You kissed and licked and worked more and more of my hot wetness onto your mouth. You reached for my other hand and put it over my breast and said, "Ohhhh, he's right here too" and moved it to my nipple. You leaned over and pushed your tongue slowly into me, lapping at my juices and getting them very wet. You pulled your mouth off for a second and looked at me very seriously, your eyes showing that you loved to be in control. You stood up as I watched you put your shorts back on. I said my pants were probably dry and we had to go.</p> <p>You walked back out to your car and waved to me as we drove off and I sat there for a minute while I wondered what you had in mind that you would do to me. We got to your car and you just handed you a pair of swim trunks and I took mine off too. We didn't talk much. I was hoping that he wouldn't ask me for sex. We got to the apartment and you took me into the bathroom and washed me up and put me in the shower, the water running down over my breasts and over my body. I took a nice bath with you watching me. I had never experienced a shower together in my life, it was very erotic. We got out the tub and I got into the shower. You climbed into the shower and I got in. We washed each other's hair and then you got a sponge and a hot soapy cloth and began washing and stroking my body. I could tell that this was becoming a lot of sexual foreplay.</p> <p>You got under the water and then lifted my body up a little and began to wash my breasts. It was my turn to kneel in the shower, facing away from you and I was trying to take deep breaths. The water was sooo good on my body. You took your mouth and lips away and looked at my breasts and the soap and then looked at my face. You took a finger and wiped a line from my forehead to my lips and then your hand, starting from my chin and going on down to my chest. You took your hand from my breast and ran your fingers down my chest around my belly and moved your hand to my leg and you reached for my mound and began to slip your finger inside me. It felt so good. I closed my eyes and leaned my head back a little and you took one of my nipples and pinched and twisted it in between your thumb and finger. You then took your other hand and put it under my leg and ran your finger up my leg to my opening. You began moving your finger up and down my lips when they were covered with myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
