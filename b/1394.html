"I'm not just going to stop fucking," and with that, I slam into her.</p> <p>At first, I start to build again. I'm pounding into her hard, grunting to be able to drive even more of that cock in. But when she starts grunting as well as panting, all of my concentration has left me.</p> <p>"Get on your knees." She immediately moves to do as said, presenting her ass to me.</p> <p>I pull out very slowly, the cock just slipping from her, a puddle of clear lubricant on the other side of the bed, the thick globs of my cock still glistening.</p> <p>She turns around slightly, and I step in.
