He groaned as the warm, delicious smell of it filled his nostrils. Her eyes were the same color as her hair.</p> <p>He stepped away from her and reached down to adjust her clothes as his eyes devoured her full body. He walked back to the chair and pulled up his underwear. He removed his shoes one by one, tossing them into the other chair and got back to work.</p> <p>He had just finished putting on his dress shirt when she looked up at him. Her eyes had changed color; now it was a warm amber color. She stepped away from him and removed her hair from her face once more.</p> <p>"So," she began. "What do you think we should do, Mr. Z?"</p> <p>"Well, what do you think?"</p> <p>"How about our house?" she challenged him. "I mean, it's all so modern and modern and modern- it makes for an old, homey, old-fashioned home."</p> <p>"Yeah, that means we'd be happy, I think," he said. "I mean, if we could both take care of that."</p> <p>She stood there, looking at him. He could see she was a bit apprehensive.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah..." he murmured as he slid his boots off. He set the fork down and unzipped his jeans, freeing his erection which had fallen back out of his zipper. He pulled down his briefs, freeing his erection and standing it up straight. He turned towards her, his eyes roaming over her.</p> <p>"Oh, do you think we're going to do anything else?" he asked.</p> <p>She glanced over the edge of the table, the plate now in front of her.</p> <p>"Yeah," she responded. "You can't see this side of me yet, Mr. Z. Now just stand there for a minute, okay?"</p> <p>"Sure, Ms. Wilson," he responded as he moved to stand in front of her.</p> <p>He leaned in for another kiss, her hair brushing his cheek as he did. The soft lips were soft and moist, their tongues exploring each others mouth, her tongue flicking against his. It didn't take long for them to get into a passionate embrace, her mouth covering his in a hot, wet, embrace.</p> <p>His hands moved up her back, brushing over her, touching her, caressing her. Her hands went to his shoulders and then slid down to the belt of his shirt, unbuttoning it, opening it. She was on her knees, her hands on his waist, her lips brushing over his stomach, her body pressing against his. Her fingers slipped into his waistband of his shorts, reaching her hand in to grip his erection. He moaned as she wrapped her fingers around the shaft of his penis and began to rhythmically stroke it.</p> <p>Her head dropped down, her long dark hair covering it, her tongue running from his balls to his penis. Her lips pulled away from his penis, their eyes still locked together. He could see her pupils dilated, his erection pointing straight up at the ceiling. The look of passion on her face was electric. She licked her lips and then gave his penis a tug until he was rock-hard. Her tongue ran from his ball sack back up to the head of his penis. As she did this, she rubbed her hands over her lips, teasing herself.</p> <p>"Ms. Wilson, I think you need more than just a kiss," he mumbled between kisses.</p> <p>"Nooo..." she whined.</p> <p>"Nope," he returned, "this weekend," he added.</p> <p>She looked at him questioningly, but he simply continued on with her. Her hand reached out, grasping his shaft to guide him into her. It made a loud, wet sucking sound as he slid deep into her warm, wet mouth. He paused for a moment to allow her to get used to him. His hand held hers over his penis, his fingers lightly caressing her hair, moving down to her shoulders, her neck, and around her shoulders.</p> <p>Her hands rested on his chest, her head bobbing up and down between his legs as she took his erection, sucking, licking. He took one of her hands in his, sliding her fingers along the shaft as she felt the hardness of it. Her fingers wrapped around his penis, one hand taking the full length, the other hand continuing the motions. Her head fell back again, her eyes shut, her mouth open, her tongue sliding along the underside of his penis, the tip of her tongue licking the slit at the tip of his penis. She began moving her head up and down the length of him, her fingers continuing to stroke the shaftâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
