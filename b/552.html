She grinned as she got dressed. "That all goes to you guys. And it ain't going to go right on the way off either."</p> <p>"You sure?"</p> <p>"Positive. I am your best friend. And we love one another more than anything. I'll never think it is wrong to spend time with her. As long as it's with you, then I can take care of myself." She nodded toward the bathroom door and went for the door handle only stopping for a long moment for a good once over her shoulder, "This way."</p> <p>She went into the room and knocked softly, "Come in."</p> <p>The door opened immediately. There was a short period of silence before the soft and sweet and sultry voice asked, "So, what brings you over here? Would you like some company?" It wasn't until she stepped in that everything seemed to change.</p> <p>For some reason it struck her as odd, they were coming here after meeting. It was the middle of winter, so here was someone that was going to let them spend the next five nights in bed with her. Who would do these things to her anyway. Besides, she didn't like the look of the place. Not as much as she liked this one. A nice old stone fireplace with logs and flickering candles and some soft music was a nice touch. The walls around the room were decorated to a new sensual feel. Not too heavy, not too fancy. It was cozy and warm. She found herself looking all around her. The walls were covered in old pictures in their various parts all over the room. The lights were dimmed in places to make the room look much paler.</p> <p>"Come on, it'll be nice, we're spending time here," She said softly as she got lost in the warmth of the room, pulling her shirt off. "You know this is where we are meeting tomorrow, you'll see me. That's right." Again the voice asked softly. "You don't look as hot in a dress as you did in panties. Why would you be wearing panties?" With the warm words coming out of his mouth, she figured it out.</p> <p>"It's not a dress. It's something else." She said with a shrug, "That's the only way I know to put it."</p> <p>"Okay," The voice said as he took off his shirt tossing it onto the floor, undid his pants and let them fall to the floor with the rest of his clothes. "I want you naked." The voice said softly. He stepped back towards her. "I want to see all of you." He stepped up to her and gently took her hands away from her breasts. They were beautiful and so inviting. He slid one hand under her shirt lifting it above her head, freeing her breasts for his view. It was the first time he got to touch them in any way other than a kiss, let alone a touch. And she was very aroused, her nipples were standing at attention. He lowered his head taking them in his mouth sucking on them. He pulled them away from her body, "I love your nipples." He said softly.</p> <p>His hands slid down and up the dress, over her hips and over her abdomen to her waist and the sides of her breasts. He took her nipples between his fingers as he lifted her by them. "God you're beautiful." He said feeling his member starting to stiffen underneath her. He slid his body down until his cock was standing at attention against her leg and her breast. He pulled away, still pulling her nipples in his fingers. She felt it pressing against her lips and opening her mouth a bit more.</p> <p>"Take them in your mouth." He said softly, "I love playing with your nipples. I'll bet you could deep-throat them all night if it wasn't for me." He let go of her nipple and let her slide her breasts across his lips feeling their heat on them. The taste of her in his mouth surprised her. His hands were running down her stomach and she reached down and grabbed his hand lifting it from her breast and holding it in front of her lips. He lowered his mouth and sucked in the skin of her right breast, then his lips. She felt the hot wetness of it and was moaning. He sucked in the other one and did the same to her other breast. He slid his tongue softly over the nipple until it was hard as pebbles and then slid it down across her breasts to her stomach and between her legs. "Oh God!" She moaned softly, "That feels so good." He took his mouth of her soft tit and slipped it down and over her stomach. The warmth of his tongue felt wonderful running across her stomach, and he could feel her body relaxing under the light touch of his hands.</p> <p>He let his tongue run across the flesh ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
