"It's so big... I'm a bit scared."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"I don't know if I can take it, I don't know how it will feel... I don't know whether this is what I wanted, I love you... it's all that much more than just sex... I'm not sure. But it was nice... I'm just so nervous and excited... we can do this. It'll be okay!"</p> <p>"Alright, I'm willing to try. Tell you what though, if it's not uncomfortable then we can go about this the easy way. Go put the robe back on, then come back to the bedroom."</p> <p>"It's a little weird seeing you in the light. I haven't really noticed you in a while, how you look now," she said.</p> <p>"You look good, too. I've never been in a room full of people like this before, so it's kind of hot," I said, laughing. I put my robe on and looked around the bedroom, not really knowing what to expect. At any rate I felt better.</p> <p>"I've never had it this hot before," she admitted.</p> <p>"Me either," I said. Then to reassure her, "I think you'll love it." I was about to ask her to get dressed, but changed my mind.</p> <p>"You're not wearing a bra?" she asked. I pointed to the bed sitting on the other side of the room. I looked through the drawers. She picked up the robe.</p> <p>"Not until you wear it and we talk, it's a long way from home." There was no way I was going to get it on again.</p> <p>"You're not going to tell anyone about this are you?" she said. I guess she was worried about letting me know how she looked.</p> <p>"No," I said. "This is going to really be weird without you."</p> <p>She hesitated, then opened the robe to reveal, not just the small breasts but those tiny puffy nipples that made the robe slide against her as she stood there. She put the robe back on, then pulled the robe over her shoulders. I put a finger to my lips and she let me pull it off. I stared at her nipples and then looked at her bare pussy. She was beautiful, I couldn't stop myself from imagining how she would look with panties on. Her body was so smooth and wet from her own juices.</p> <p>"It would make me want to come even more," she said.</p> <p>I felt so helpless as a man trying to seduce my beautiful wife. I guess that in any of our previous relationships she'd wanted to come on to me. And she said it, just like I'd heard it say in conversations with the girls whenever we'd talk about sex. She was a virgin, I would have to give her the right encouragement. Especially if it meant she was going to make it with a man who was also very much into anal. "If I can get you off as well, it will probably be worth it," I thought.</p> <p>We talked for a bit about different things, about her job, when she felt that I didn't really want to talk about her. She explained it was so easy for her because of my age. I didn't feel quite so naive to being a man in an age range. I also felt like I already knew what she'd be doing with a man... what I was already doing with her. I still couldn't quite believe it when I realized that she was still going to have to do whatever I told her as she watched, but it seemed right to me.</p> <p>After talking for a while, she got up and started to get her bathrobe on. She turned around, her back to me. "I'll get it." she said. As she left the room she gave me a quick glance across the room. My mouth was agape. Here we were, standing in the nude, her back turned to me, her nipples standing and her face staring out the window and her ass high in the air. This is the most unbelievable feeling I'd ever had. I couldn't believe it. It was actually happening.</p> <p>She turned around so that I could put my arms around her and we embraced. Our lips met and parted. I kissed her ear. Then I whispered in her ear,</p> <p>"I want to be good for you, too." She turned around to kiss me. We made a very intense kiss. It felt like a lifetime. Finally we separated and she smiled a sexy smile.</p> <p>"I've got a surprise for you when we get back," she said. "Remember this: I bought you a very special sexy lingerie."</p> <p>"I'll get theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
