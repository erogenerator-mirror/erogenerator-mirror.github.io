I’m so sorry that I have to walk like this right in front of my husband…to my friend”.</p> <p>“Oh, I guess you had to go in there in the store”, he told her.</p> <p>“I must be dreaming”, she said as they left the shoe store hand in hand.</p> <p>“Maybe I am”, Mike answered.</p> <p>Mike and his wife headed to the bathroom to wash off a bit. They were about 30 minutes into the trip when Mike heard a woman’s voice.</p> <p>“That was very rude of you to come in like that”, he told himself.</p> <p>He heard a few guys’ remarks.</p> <p>He smiled and headed back up to get a drink. He grabbed his coat.</p> <p>As he walked back up to the store he noticed some of the guys had gathered around the bar trying to get a better view than what his wife was wearing and others were checking her out. Mike thought to himself, “She is beautiful doesn’t she?”</p> <p>When he entered the store, there were about ten guys. He headed along to help some of them out. When he walked in from the bathroom he found that some of the men were standing around talking to each other. He looked around when he saw her walking towards the back of the store to get a book to read. As he was walking away, he saw the girl in the back of her store standing with the three guys. He watched closely as she came back with a book, and he noticed that the panties she was in were missing. He walked over to her and said.</p> <p>“That’s what you needed help with in your daydream”.</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed him.</p> <p>“So it’s ok to look like that” he said.</p> <p>“It’s nice to have some men seeing me like that”.</p> <p>A little embarrassed by the attention she was getting, he felt his cock start to swell in his pants. Mike knew that even though he was sitting at the bar, the looks that were being given to his wife by the young group of guys now watching her, it didn’t help that she was wearing two of the shortest panties ever. It was an incredibly sexy sight. As they left the store, the guys were all pointing to the girl dressed only in what Mike saw as her panties.</p> <p>Mike made his way back to his car and sat quietly in his seat. He had never seen Jenny in anything that tiny before but he was sure that she was enjoying it. It was getting late and he had to get home and change before going to bed. He didn’t want to get caught doing something that he shouldn’t have. He was a little surprised by the way the night had gone. The look on Jenny’s face as she looked at the panties had him thinking that he had caught her masturbating. He couldn’t believe that she had just asked him to help her get panties off and suck her husband’s cock.</p> <p>He smiled as he thought of what just happened and how he’d almost climaxed as he watched her lick her panties. It must have had the same affect on his wife. They’d sat and talked for hours but they had never reached a climax even though they both wanted to. Mike knew that he couldn’t wait to get home. Tonight he had to go home.</p> <p>Before long Mike pulled into the driveway and got out to get a cold drink. As Mike entered the house he saw that his wife was still standing where she had stood the first time they saw her getting ready for dinner.</p> <p>“That was something special”, she said. Mike smiled and started to head to the TV. She stopped him.</p> <p>“This is going to be a great night. Why don’t you go and have a beer and we can just watch the movie”. Mike followed her to the den. When she closed the door behind her Mike could have sworn he saw her get more comfortable.</p> <p>“I thought that you and I could watch it”, she said.</p> <p>“I like it when you do that”, Mike told her.””</p> <p>“Well lets see why we're not getting to have more fun tonight”, she said as she picked up the remote and started playing the DVD”. she said—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
