The words hit her all at once, and she cried out before the world had stopped spinning at the mere sight of Amy's naked body, and the sounds of her own voice.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?" Amy whispered and stroked her hair a little more.</p> <p>"You have an incredible body!" The words were so breathy they nearly blew her away but her legs wouldn't let her move.</p> <p>"You've got a nice body," Amy whispered again and again, never missing a beat in the soft rhythm of her breathing.</p> <p>"So are you," Amy whispered back, and reached behind as if to touch herself. But she knew that it would not make much better sense to bring out the teasing. Instead, she reached out again and put her hand between Amy's legs, rubbing the tip of a finger against her sopping lips, before pulling it away.</p> <p>"Not as much fun as just looking," Amy whispered as she pushed her finger out of herself, and the sound of her own words filled their senses in a heartbeat. "Come with me to your bedroom."</p> <p>With the promise that they would sleep on the floor, she slid out of her clothes and wrapped herself up tightly in the soft, silk sheets that were as white as the sheets next to hers and the warmth of the bed in the glow of the lamp that filled the room.</p> <p>"I can't believe that you are all of this out here!" Amy breathed as she watched in horror, as her best friend's body shook as she made every move and then shivered as she fell asleep without even realizing it.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>He felt his heart leap as he entered Amy's room and slid across the threshold, and leaned close to her as his hand reached out to pull the curtain shut, hoping that she would awaken and look up at him. But she didn't! It was dark in the room, and she must have gone to sleep again as soon as her eyes focused.</p> <p>"It's Christmas Eve and you have to leave for good!" He whispered as he stared down at the sheet that lay across her beautiful body, a white sheet.</p> <p>"We can't!" It was all Amy could say as she tried desperately to turn it onto her side in case a stranger had seen their brief exchange. "The whole place knows we're here."</p> <p>"It's true," he said as she turned towards him once more, the sheet covering her body from the waist up, and the look in her eyes that told him that she was not convinced. "I guess I should have let you get dressed then, but you didn't do all the work when you were getting dressed."</p> <p>"That's right," she said and smiled and moved one of her legs up onto the bed, putting one end up towards his shoulder. "You can't be so sure that we're not all here!" She paused and smiled as he slipped his arm around her and pulled her towards him so that she lay back upon the bed and then he had the chance to look down at her in the flickering candlelight, as if the candle was a candle burning in the room. And that he would never forget.</p> <p>"So, you were in the bathroom with those other women?" It was a question that had once again taken him by surprise, but he shook his head.</p> <p>"They were trying to hide it. I guess it's more of a fantasy after all."</p> <p>"So, they wanted you to wear them out," a soft laugh came in her throat and she sat up on the bed while her eyes glittered in the light, and she put her hand up next to her mouth and shook her head. "Who would guess that you thought I was getting all of those dirty fantasies out of you? But I'd have been upset if you did."</p> <p>"I was hoping you wouldn't," he admitted as he pulled her closer to the edge so she laid herself down next to him. "Just what I thought I'd want to know."</p> <p>"You can tell," Amy whispered, her eyes locked onto his long, thick hand sliding up and down her exposed thigh. "Just remember this."</p> <p>"Remember the things you did with that old man over there?" he asked in the same soft voice she had spoken the night before that had made him think for only a second of the time they'd been separated for years. "Did you enjoy it?"</p> <p>"I know I did," Amy whispered, as her hand found his long, hot leg, and she began to play with it with one motion, not so much to hide it as to feel the texture of his skin and the hardness beneathâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
