We were both there because of her. We were both willing to accept her total and undemanding domination of me. We both felt an undeniable connection there.</p> <p>It felt like we were the only two people there at each other's company conference, and in front of an entire room full of people at least, at some point in the evening.</p> <p>I felt very comfortable being her slave for the evening.</p> <p>"Oh my god," I whispered hoarsely, "Mistress, I can't believe I am doing this."</p> <p>"I know," she responded, in an affected, sexy manner," It just gets better and better, baby."</p> <p>"But you can't expect me to keep my end of the bargain, baby."</p> <p>"No, I promise you that."</p> <p>"But what if I promise you that?"</p> <p>"You better," she replied with a naughty smile, "and then you can make me pay."</p> <p>"And then you can take me home and ravish me at the end of the evening," I replied with a lecherous grin on my face.</p> <p>We went back to the conference, which was held there in the same building that we had just met, but a few miles outside the city limits, in a building that sold computers and computers that had already been used, many were still being used in a capacity that could only be completed with the current state or state laws.</p> <p>The women at the conference table were there, too. We sat near each other in the conference room's conference room, our legs and arms touching slightly. Everyone watched with their own eyes, trying to get a brief peek at what we were doing.</p> <p>Some in the room had their ears pressed up against a table, listening and listening as we pleasured ourselves in various ways. Some by themselves, some alone, some with their own spouses or others with others, each man watching, waiting to get a clear view of the activities going on in front of him.</p> <p>At the same time, the only people in our room who we were doing anything at that point were the women and some of the men in the room.</p> <p>For the next half hour, we sat quietly and watched the people attending the conference in various states and states. At some point, I was brought to an orgasm, right there in front of anyone who might happen to gaze upon us. I could see her finger slide deeper and deeper inside my pussy while I tried to concentrate on the conversation going on in front of the conference table. The sight of what we all were about to feel was a bit like a sexual high.</p> <p>I was trying to look down at what I was doing to her, but couldn't as she sat with her skirt hiked and her panties bunched up to her hips and leaned back on me, her legs spread and her head held back by both hands under her left arm, her right looking for and holding a fork in her pussy, licking her fingers as they slid in and out of herself and in and out of her vagina, as if she had two fingers inside herself. Her face, however, was frozen in place as she saw everything that we were doing in front of her eyes. She also noticed that I was sitting there looking with such a sexual intensity that she was embarrassed to look at us.</p> <p>"Oh I bet you wish it was that, don't you, you dirty girl."</p> <p>'Oh, so do I," was the only response I could say.</p> <p>My own reaction was just as obvious. At only that level of arousal, but also so intensely intense.</p> <p>Before long though, she pushed me into her and pulled her dress up completely. It was completely lifted above her waist, exposing her bare bottom and pussy, which were wide open and inviting. My eyes were still on her for a moment, before I turned my head to a side to take her face in my hands and kiss her, our tongues licking and probing each other's mouths as we kissed.</p> <p>I looked down at the sight of all of this and felt a little bit of jealousy that she could do such a thing by exposing herself, to others knowing of what she had done, and doing it openly. The realization of it struck me quite a bit the same.</p> <p>She removed her hand from her pussy and slowly raised her panties, placing one foot on the floor and one foot on the chair.</p> <p>Standing up, she bent over. Her dress flipped up exposing her bottom and pussy, her left leg dangling, her legs apart and her fingers still inside of her vagina. Then, she looked at her front, the two legs parted and her hands holding her panties. Her left hand came close and her breasts, even though only I had ever seen that before, appeared to be the largest, her nipples were long and prominent.
