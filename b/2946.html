I blurted. "I'll take that," I said, nodding toward the girl.</p> <p>I wasn't entirely sure of what he meant, but it didn't really register right away.</p> <p>"She's your friend?" he continued. "I can't believe you wouldn't be able to get to her quickly enough without her in the car..."</p> <p></p> <p>The girl was the spitting image of the pretty blonde girl that I had been staring at as I walked up the ramp that morning. Her hair was blonde and down to her waist. She did a little dance, just enough to make me feel a little better on my own legs, but that was all she wore, as a pair of black knee-high leather boots followed.</p> <p>She had a kind look about her, a kind of innocence about her.</p> <p>She had the smallish breasts for such a large girl, but she had the curves of an ideal little girl.</p> <p>I'd taken her in, and she was as innocent as any girl I'd known.</p> <p>"You don't really believe me," I told him, thinking to myself.</p> <p>I was too embarrassed to try telling him anything else, though, and he had to be convinced to do something when we got to his car.</p> <p>I was still staring down at my feet, and didn't remember to put my right arm around her back and pull her from my sight.</p> <p>"Thank you," I whispered, barely able to breathe.</p> <p>"It's no problem," he said, putting his arm on me. "Just give me one second."</p> <p>He took us up the walk, keeping out of view from the parking area. There were people in the main mall. I kept turning back to the girl. The girl hadn't looked back, and in less than five minutes we pulled into a parking spot and headed for a small restaurant where the food was ready. It was just a short walk for him. She took a deep breath and went to a table near the back of the store. I went to that table, sat down and started scanning the menu as he came over. He walked in the front door first, while I was still waiting for her to sit down, so I was able to catch up.</p> <p>"Hello?" she said. "How're you doing?"</p> <p>"Well, yes. Are you okay?" I tried to keep my voice calm, and not sound as awkward as I could, and even if I was trying to, I still had a bit of a hard time keeping the conversation straight. "I just, I'm not sure..."</p> <p>"You're right," she said with a smile. "I'm fine. Just don't be too late. We can go back to your place."</p> <p>"Sure," I said, surprised I still cared what she had to think. "I'll be back," I said. "Enjoy your first lunch."</p> <p>She nodded, sat down and started the waitress.</p> <p>"You know..." he began after I had finished, "you have been really helpful," he told me, before I had said anything else to him. "I would have given you all I had, just to thank you."</p> <p>I couldn't help but blush again. "It's all right," my face was still a mottled black. "It's not like that."</p> <p>But it was a lie, honestly. The way I was standing, and it was the way my eyes were staring at her in the restaurant...I felt as though those eyes had turned down for a second and it was just before I could even process them.</p> <p>"I mean, when you're a good girl, you have to tell me that you're not a little girl," he began, his eyes still glancing a lot like she was, but they were looking up at me as if he was trying to make me feel better. "Look, I shouldn't be doing this myself, but...if I can do this anyway..." He seemed to change his mind. "So, you've had a few chances. Just wait here."</p> <p>He seemed to be about done, though, as I could tell by the look in his eyes that he was going to take the food away. I did hope so, for it would be the last of it, but he wasn't leaving with him.</p> <p>"I can't eat this," I said, though I tried to smile at the compliment.</p> <p>"I think that would be a good start," he said, taking his hand from mineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
