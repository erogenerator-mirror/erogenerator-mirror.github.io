"How have you been?" she asked again as he got up from his office chair.</p> <p>"Good," he said. "You are quite the girl, aren't you."</p> <p>"Thanks," she beamed.</p> <p>"Yes." he replied. "I remember you from before and I know that you like me too." He was speaking to her but could not tell how much she thought she knew and so only when he spoke to her would she know the answer and when he said I could she say yes. Only she would not believe this. He had to have told her more, too. "I have been waiting for you to do exactly what you said. I was waiting for you to open yourself up for me. You know I'll never touch you, but if you don't want me to make love to you, just do so, and I'll make love to you. I'll kiss and touch every square inch and the most beautiful woman I can ever hope to be with."</p> <p>"You do know I'll never kiss you."</p> <p>"Why?" he asked.</p> <p>"Because that's what you say and I know because of your beauty, it wouldn't be right." He laughed at that, too.</p> <p>"No, I mean it," he said. "As much as I love you right now, I am not sure I love you as I love all those women that I have known." He was speaking to her as if he was saying and hoping to convince her. "I am not about you as a girl who just wants to kiss and have love. I am more about you as a woman who wants to make love. I have taken a lover who has wanted me as her and never wanted you to get hurt and have to put a stop to it."</p> <p>"So, what did you mean when you said 'make love to me'?" she asked.</p> <p>"I said make love to me," he said. "With every fiber of my being. Please, my love."</p> <p>She didn't answer immediately, but she did answer again as he had before when she was making a decision. "Make love to me?" he repeated in his head as he kissed her cheek.</p> <p>She blushed red and reached up, grabbing his face. She pulled his lips back to hers and kissed him hard, her tongue probing his mouth. His cock jerked in his pants as she did, and she was glad it was in control of him. "Did it hurt when you kissed me like that?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "It felt good after I kissed your sweet lips so much."</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm, I liked that," she said.</p> <p>He kissed her again but harder this time. "I like it too, but first, I want to do a lot of kissing before making love to you."</p> <p>He wanted to make love to her. Even though he didn't really know her, he wondered what it would be like to do what he had just said to her. She had been so willing before but now she was pulling away from him. He realized again that she was not talking. He turned her face to look at him and met his eyes. She did not say an expression as she kissed him. She looked like she wanted to run, but still did not say a word, but she turned and kissed him before standing. He gave one look to see if she would go, and she did but didn't.</p> <p>He wanted to talk about it to her, to let her know he cared more for her too. He wanted to tell her the things he had written about what had happened, that had meant so much to her that he couldn't explain. He wanted to tell her, tell her that he wanted her to make love to him, but again, there was no real reason for her to do that. He felt a lump in his throat, too, but he also wanted to hear her say yes, to be with her and make love with her and make her happy. She didn't say a word. He kissed her back, his lips crushing hers and he couldn't stop himself from kissing her again. Finally she broke away.</p> <p>"That was quite a story," she said. "What did you think was going to happen?"</p> <p>"It wasn't planned at all."</p> <p>"Well? Well what can I say, you have got to be kidding." She leaned down and gave him a wet, hungry kiss.</p> <p>"No, that wasn't it," he said. "I felt bad. Bad enough for you to take advantage of me like that."</p> <p>She kissed him again, her right hand on his arm.</p> <p>"It isn't right for you to take advantage of me like that," he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
