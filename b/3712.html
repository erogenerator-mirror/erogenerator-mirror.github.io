I asked, a little shocked.</p> <p>I heard the click of a small microphone somewhere low in the corner of the bar. I tried to make my voice soft, just like I knew the words would sound like.</p> <p>My voice did.</p> <p>"I want to fuck your mouth, too. You can lick your lips."</p> <p>Her hand came up and cupped my crotch. A little thrill of excitement ran through me. I had always found women to be rather shy on the face of it but I knew this would be different. She must have sensed that. In an instant I was a virgin and not quite so vulnerable by being so close to the other. She pulled down my panties and I lay with my legs open, my hand between my thighs, so her fingers could explore between them. I felt her warm breath on my pussy.</p> <p>"You smell good. It feels like you've been waiting for this."</p> <p>She put her thumb between my lips and I tried to bring my hand up to touch myself. A gasp of pleasure came through the room. She took her hand away and took hold of my hair with both hands.</p> <p>"Lick it, girl."</p> <p>She pushed her tongue between my lips and at first I did nothing. I looked up at her, my face flushed, her expression a little unsure. She looked down and saw me, I felt so vulnerable, so at odds with what I thought. She took a finger and wiped the come from her lips and held it up to me. I knew what she wanted as I tried to lick her finger and taste my come. She pulled back and I put my head down and looked at her. Her nipples were hard points pressing out in front of her. She nodded and I opened my mouth to her and closed my lips. She pushed her finger back into my mouth and I tasted myself and then her finger. She pulled her finger out and rubbed some of my come on my lips and then my chin and on mine and said,</p> <p>"That's nice. You should do that regularly."</p> <p>I opened my mouth again. She pulled her finger away and then sucked my lips again. I was surprised that she didn't clean up my come with her mouth. I think it's a little gross, but it actually turned me on. It was her own turn on.</p> <p>"Your turn." she said.</p> <p>I could feel her hand at my crotch again. She slowly unzipped me and pushed the side of my panties to one side and her fingers dipped into the wetness there. Then she pressed against my pussy. I was so hot and wet that her fingers pushed in easily. I thought I would come just by it. Then she pushed her fingers in again and my breathing got harder. I felt the finger move away and then slowly press on my clit. I wanted to die right there. I had never felt anything like this before. Then her fingers were back and they were pushing back in. She was slowly doing everything. Her tongue seemed to come up between her lips and then she stopped and looked up at me with her big, bright eyes as she slid her fingers gently out of me without stopping. She stood up and kissed me. In that moment I wished. I wanted more of this. I wanted to touch her. I wanted to taste this girl. I wanted to feel her. I had never felt that for myself. I wanted her.</p> <p>"Do you want me to fuck you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I reached down and grabbed her hand and pulled her into me. As my legs parted she put her hand down there and guided it back, then put in two. Then she pushed her fingers back down inside me and started to push in and out. My body stiffened and I felt myself begin to come but it wasn't as forceful as I had imagined. It was a nice orgasm and she sensed it.</p> <p>"C'mon. We can't just sit here and go at it. Get out your panties."</p> <p>I reached down and pulled them off but she just held them up in front of me. She had a grin and she wanted me to. It was too late for anything else. This felt too good. I grabbed my skirt hem and pulled it up over my knee and up off my thigh. I was so glad I had worn panties or they would have made my come even worse. The way they clung to my pussy was exciting, though, as the way they pulled back on my clit was even more sexy. I felt like I could do it again.</p> <p>"Let's do it," I said.</p> <p>"We can start right now," she said, kissing me again and stepping a little closer. Her fingers returned to me and I felt her thumb on the outside of my thigh. She pushed in and then pulled herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
