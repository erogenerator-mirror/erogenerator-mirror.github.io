For all he knew, he might of been able to get off without using much of his strength, but for now, it might be a good idea for him to go to the bedroom when he got there with his cock in hand, or he would get it.</p> <p>His breathing started speeding up, and he felt himself getting closer and closer to coming.</p> <p>Just as he thought he couldn't take anymore, his wife's pussy tightened around his cock, and his own cock let loose a torrent of come, shooting his load into that sweet hole.</p> <p>They both froze, breathing hard, when their bodies relaxed, and then slowly came back to earth.</p> <p>"You're coming too, darling," she said, breathlessly.</p> <p>"Thanks," he said, "that felt amazing."</p> <p>"That was amazing, it was the best. We're going to have to try to keep it up for as long as we can," she said with a warm smile and a wink.</p> <p>"That's an understatement," he said, "that was fantastic."</p> <p>"Now, we should get going," she said, kissing him.</p> <p>He let out a surprised gasp as he was released from his bondage, and he immediately went into his bedroom with his dick semi-erect.</p> <p>"What? I thought I was ready," he said.</p> <p>"It will be easier for you to get ready if you'll just have to wait a few minutes until I say 'time'," she said. "Now go to bed and give me a kiss. It's going to be a long night."</p> <p>He thought about kissing her, but for his sake, he would probably have to wait another few minutes before doing this. Not that he wasn't attracted to a beautiful woman, but this woman, he was a little attracted to his wife. He was just a little jealous. And he couldn't explain why though. Not yet, anyway, but soon, he was going to have to be a little more sure that he hadn't ruined them by letting her down.</p> <p>And if they never get through with the divorce, then they'll have to make up for it, okay?</p> <p>"I can't wait!" she said, and she walked into the en-suite bathroom.</p> <p>She looked at him in the mirror, and felt guilty; she shouldn't feel sorry for him. He was a good looking man, and they had only talked about sex, not doing anything else. But, now that he was so turned on, she didn't feel a sense of guilt at all. She knew what was coming, and she was going to give him a blow-job.</p> <p>"It's okay," she told herself.</p> <p>After he got under the covers, he laid back and closed his eyes. After thinking about the day, he was hard again as he waited for her.</p> <p>Finally, he heard the water running in the bathroom, and he heard her moving around. She came in the bedroom, naked, with a big smile on her face. He was confused as to why he didn't feel guilty at all at all about taking such a great chance on her, but he was pretty sure, in his mind, that it was because he was getting sex, and all he had to do was wait for her to come out of the bathroom. After all, it's been almost three months since he had come out of that door, so he probably shouldn't be feeling bad about this. He couldn't really blame her for thinking her fantasy was sexy, because it had been a couple of weeks, and she probably wanted him to take her.</p> <p>"You're making me incredibly horny," she said.</p> <p>The room's light was dimmed, and she leaned closer to him. Her hands were on his bare chest, and he felt himself getting hard again. This time, she didn't stop at his chest, she leaned in and kissed it. He sucked in his breath, and his heart was racing. He felt her warm breath on his face, and then her tongue slipped inside his ear. And then her hand wandered down to his dick.</p> <p>"Oh," she moaned. "That feels really good," she said. She started stroking him as she kissed his ear again. "God, you don't feel so much better after you get done fucking me," she said, then she kissed him again. "That was so good. You're good at this," she said, and she kissed him again.</p> <p>She moved down his body, to his stomach and back up to his shoulders. Her kisses were getting hotter as she ran her fingers down his chest and stomach, and then slid down lower. His cock was fully erect now, and he startedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
