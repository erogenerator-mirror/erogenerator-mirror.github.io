I'm sorry. I just don't know what to do."</p> <p>"Maybe you could just stay here."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I just didn't feel right to stay in here."</p> <p>I saw her start to say something.</p> <p>"I'm pretty sure you are."</p> <p>"I told you, this is my first time here."</p> <p>I went to the door and took it with me. I sat on the bed and started looking around and tried to think about what to do. She just started to smile and that put a smile on my face. I reached out for her, our hands meeting and then her hands coming to my face and her hand resting on mine. She smiled up at me and pulled our hands closer together. She started kissing my top, first my chest, then down a trail to my belly button. I reached back and found her breast, she could feel it, and I squeezed it. It felt so warm and soft. I looked down and saw her hand stroking my cock through the fabric of my boxers.</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>She kissed my lips and then pulled my shirt from my body. We got a robe on and we went to the living room to find some drinks. We sat on the sofa and I handed her a drink.</p> <p>"To new experiences and to new life."</p> <p>"To new experiences and new experiences."</p> <p>"I don't know what you expected. What have done all this for me?"</p> <p>"How about you?"</p> <p>"It was fun."</p> <p>"But it's a lot of work for that, I'm not too good at it."</p> <p>"I've been looking at you, waiting for the right man to say 'Hi'"</p> <p>"I thought I knew you."</p> <p>"I know you did."</p> <p>I got up and walked over to her.</p> <p>"We need to make it a lot more exciting and enjoyable for both of us."</p> <p>"That works for me."</p> <p>"Good. Now what's the matter? Do you feel tired or lonely?"</p> <p>"Maybe just a little."</p> <p>"It's going to be fun, it's just that it hasn't happened to me before. It might be exciting for me the other way, but you know, it's not."</p> <p>"Just try."</p> <p>I started with her neck, softly kissing each side of her neck and then down over her shoulders. I started down her back and slowly went lower. I reached around and kissed her, all the way down, all the way to the top of her bra. I pulled the top down, leaving her breasts exposed. I kissed, licked, and sucked on one of her breasts and then the other. I kissed and nibbled them, teasing them with my lips. She started pushing them towards my face. I kissed those tits and suckled them, moving lower and lower. I pushed it up and started licking and biting the nipple as she started moaning, thrusting her tits towards me harder. I licked and sucked on her tits again as my fingers explored her pussy lips and then inserted a finger into her pussy as she started thrusting her hips towards me. I could see the wetness as I moved my finger down and then up her lips. She had her eyes closed and her head tilted backwards as she had a dreamy look in her eyes. I lowered myself to my knees and kissed her nipples again as I got her skirt off, leaving her underwear on to make a quick strip tease. I got up astride her chest with my cock and rubbed my hands all over her face, chest and lower thighs, starting with my hands. My hands moved over her breasts, caressing them, feeling the weight and texture and feeling her nipples. Her breasts were just the right size for her and I licked and sucked on her nipples.

She started moving around my tongue and mouth, pushing her tongue into my mouth to meet mine. We were moaning and moaning as I kept the rhythm going. We were both breathing heavy as we were approaching orgasm. I moved one hand down to find her clit, rubbing it and rubbing it a little faster and harder.</p> <p>"Let me come."</p> <p>"Not yet."</p> <p>She pushed me and went back to the bed. I watched as she got up onto her knees, her body moving up and down. All through my arousal, knowing how much she would love to suck my cock, I wanted that to happen. I took her hand off my cock and pulled her to me. As I put her on her back, I took care of her tits.
