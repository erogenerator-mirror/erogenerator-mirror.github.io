The parking lot was pretty deserted. We walked in and got comfortable in the front car. After watching the road we were soon in a circular driveway with a gate leading off towards the ocean. A little after sunset we had stopped to go inside.</p> <p>A woman in her forties came out.</p> <p>"Hi," she said. She looked in a blue suit without a top. She looked older than most but definitely very attractive in its own own right. She had to be close to forty-five years old.</p> <p>"May I help you ladies?" the woman said with a smile as a raised hand.</p> <p>I turned to look at them. They to be in their late twenties and looked to be about the same age as us. There was something about their faces that didn't quite make up for their age. They wore glasses and high heels.</p> <p>"Excuse me, may I help you?" I said, indicating the door. My eyes drifted to this woman who was standing right in front of me. She was just a little shorter than me, with dark hair.</p> <p>"Yes. What is the problem? Is everything all right here?" she asked. She had a kind of puckered-brown mouth. I could smell food in there but wasn't able to identify the food.</p> <p>I took the initiative to give her just a little bit of a look. She had a kind of nervous flushing to her face but she didn't appear uncomfortable at all. Her voice said, "The problem is that I'm not used to looking at people all that much." She paused. "Maybe a little late but what's the problem?"</p> <p>"I'm here for a very private talk," I told her.</p> <p>The woman smiled. "I'm very attracted to you," I heard my friend say to me.</p> <p>"If you're interested in seeing it here," I asked, "would you like me to show you?"</p> <p>"Uh, I'm fine."</p> <p>She took my hand and kissed it. "It's really nice to be able to talk to someone. And you'll like it."</p> <p>She led back into a hallway and pointed to the door.</p> <p>"Just a little," I said. She nodded.</p> <p>The woman was back with several boxes.</p> <p>"Where is everybody?" the woman asked.</p> <p>She led us toward the door. "The place where everything is is on the left," she said.</p> <p>She led us through a door and inside. "If your curiosity is peaked you'll be able to enjoy it!"</p> <p>She took out a glass of wine and poured half of it in that glass.</p> <p>I felt strange but really enjoyed what she was doing. She handed me the glass. "This is a special evening for me," she said. "You are going to be very comfortable."</p> <p>She had me sit on an area rug in the middle of the room. She then stood facing me and poured me a glass of wine herself. I felt my eyes wandering all over her body. She wasn't wearing a jacket. I took the glass, opened it and took some of the wine. I took a few sips, savoring the wine and it's flavor. This woman had a nice touch. I realized I was becoming turned on and started to feel a little bolder. I took another sip.</p> <p>She went to my knees, lifted my t shirt and pulled it off over my head. She then lifted my shorts and dropped them to the ground. The lady then came over and started to fondle me. She had quite a talent at petting. There was little resistance in me. As she continued playing with my cock, it started to get hard in her hand.</p> <p>"You are getting quite hard!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>"A little," I confirmed.</p> <p>She was slowly wanking me. She reached out, put her right hand around my balls and started to massage them. Her mouth and tongue were doing wonders on my erection.</p> <p>"You have an erection?" the lady asked, turning her attention to my cock.</p> <p>It didn't take long to agree. I didn't think I was going to last long. The lady's expert sucking was getting me close to the edge. I wanted her, and she knew how to treat that, especially if I liked it. She looked up at me, grinned and said, "That's sooo nice!" That made me even harder.</p> <p>I was getting ready to explode when all of a sudden, the woman changed her positionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
