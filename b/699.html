She was beginning to breathe heavier, causing the back of one hand to rub her crotch through the fabric of her jeans, which she pushed into her clit as she continued to kiss her new lover with greater intensity.</p> <p>In the rear of their room, a sound from the bathroom startled them both. It was a high-pitched tune from the soft music that had started earlier in the evening. The man standing outside turned around a few times to see what was making the noise and stopped in his tracks. He was wearing white T-shirt with his arms stretched out in front of him, his feet crossed at the ankles in a 'V'. The top four buttons of his jeans were all undone and he was sliding his hands all the way up his legs. As always, he was wearing shorts, but tonight his cock was rock-hard and sticking up past his shorts like a tent pole. He looked over his shoulder at the man holding the door of the bathroom and saw that it was Amber. They had never really spoken in the hallway, or in person, but he thought she was cute.</p> <p>"Can I use your bathroom, Master?" her voice was barely a whisper.</p> <p>"Yes," he said, moving a little nearer to her in hopes to slip by unnoticed.</p> <p>"Can all the girls in this place use yours?" she asked with a wiggle of her hips.</p> <p>"Yes, I guess so, Mistress, if they only wanted me to," he answered, then turned away from her.</p> <p>"Did you use it already, slave?" she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Yes, it's perfect, Mistress."</p> <p>"You're not a slave yet, are you?"</p> <p>"No, Mistress," he said, feeling a little ashamed of his lack of confidence.</p> <p>"Good," she gave him a devilish smile and leaned a little closer to him. "But I am really curious about this room. I'll bet that you could get us into anything, with just a few of us, and a little less than you wanted in here already," she said.</p> <p>All he could do was nod his head in agreement. They had been so far from each other the first night that she had to say something about it at the last minute. She turned back to him. His eyes were locked on hers and she reached up and ran her middle finger on his cheek. "Do you want to leave now? Maybe you can use the bathroom while I get you something else to wear?" she said, giving him a peck on the lips.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that I can even walk through here without running, Mistress," he said.</p> <p>"Oh?"</p> <p>"I'll just have to take your jacket." He took it, zipping it up and taking Amber's hand, pulling him with her before she had time to protest. As she started down the hall to her bedroom, he said, "You must be really excited by now," not missing a beat when he took her hand again.</p> <p>"Maybe a little. I've never really been into exhibitionism before or after a good sex life, but I guess that my curiosity is already building to the ultimate level, and I'm just hoping I can handle it." She had always been a little apprehensive about being a lesbian, but she always said yes to whatever men she was with. For now though, she didn't want to risk a chance to find out the answer to whether that answer was even good.</p> <p>*</p> <p>When they entered their bedroom, the smell of freshly showered sheets washed over the two of them. She lay her body completely open to him, looking up at him with a look of submission in her eyes. She leaned in close to take his lips, and when he was not kissing her, she brushed his chest with her hand and whispered in his ear, "I need you so bad," then pulled herself up to a sitting position so they could be eye to eye and breathe. While he was not a very tall guy, a few inches shorter than her, he was easily taller than she. He had a nice build and when she leaned her face close to his, he knew she was about to kiss him. She had to take his hand so she didn't topple. She had never told him about her past with a man, but now she did, and although she never really did it before, she didn't mind either.</p> <p>She guided his hand down to her slit and as she continued to kiss his face and neck, she ground her hips at the feeling his hand and fingers were giving her. She felt his hand slip inside her shirt, and he gave her nipples a quick tweak as he continued to stroke them. She was breathing heavily as his kisses traced patterns down her neck and intoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
