Do you have to go now?” She asked me.</p> <p>I glanced across at her to confirm my suspicions and confirmed that she was definitely out of the woods.</p> <p>I couldn’t get over it! With an impassive expression, I began to untie my wife’s bikini top and remove it. Slowly, her nipples were already erect from being exposed fully to us both, and the cooler air had them erect. A wave of desire began to sweep through me as I lowered my head down and sucked one as I reached to the other and gently nipped it with my teeth.</p> <p>With a deep breath, my eyes locked upon her erect nipples. As I reached up to rub her left nipple with one hand, my wife gently tugged on my cock and began to stroke with her right.</p> <p>“You know, after a while, I really don’t mind being your girlfriend, don’t you?” I asked. She leaned over and kissed me, tasting her juices from my mouth for the first time.</p> <p>I had to tell her. “Well, if you have a problem that wouldn’t be my problem…I’m outta here.” She smiled and leaned back to put a hand on my chest.</p> <p>“Oh, but I’ve always loved to be your girlfriend,” she smiled.</p> <p>I looked down my wife’s body, at her hardened nipples, and the dampness I’d just created with my tongue, all while we continued our conversation as if we’d never met. She leaned to kiss me again, and my hands slid over the soft skin of her side. I lightly caressed her shoulder with one hand, her other running up and down her arm and arm and across her breast.</p> <p>I kissed my wife’s shoulder, then moved my head off her and said, “You have such a nice, beautiful skin.”</p> <p>“Oh, yes, honey, I’m glad you like it.” She replied with her arms wrapped around my neck.</p> <p>Just before I moved to kiss her neck, she said softly, “Now, what are we going to do about your problem with the bikini?”</p> <p>“Oh, I’m going to kiss you. I want to kiss you.” I replied, and she leaned her head back so my lips could press against her, gently kissing back toward her lips.</p> <p>We finally broke the embrace, and I was still trying to regain my dignity. “Well…why don’t we change the game here. Why don’t we both put on our bathing suits?” I said, as I was reaching for the bottom of the bikini to tie them together. My wife looked at me, and I could see the excitement on her face.</p> <p>“If you don’t mind my saying so, I’ve been dreaming about seeing you both naked.” My wife was looking at me with a look that just about made me lose a bit of my dignity, but I didn’t care.</p> <p>I was thinking, “Well…how about you and I going for a swim?” The thought of seeing my wife’s hard nipples being fondled by two of my best friends for the very first time was a very erotic thought, and it seemed to be even more if the girls could feel it.</p> <p>We walked along the water’s edge, our hands slowly roaming all over each other’s bodies. I could just imagine that our spouses were watching us’s hands as we gently explored each others’ backs, legs, even touching each other’s hard nipples.</p> <p>Our bodies were only barely touching. I couldn’t tell if my wife noticed my erect nipples when I brushed her hair off the side of her face, or if she was just slightly turned on, while we continued our hot conversation. “Well, we’re both in here,” she said as she leaned over and kissed me with a lingering touch.</p> <p>“Do you like what we have decided to make our friendship special?” I asked.</p> <p>I could feel her chest rising and falling quickly as she answered, “Oh I love everything we’ve got, sweetie.” She began to blush.</p> <p>“Good.” “I can’t wait to see your tits.” I continued, and the words really excited my wife.</p> <p>We both took deep breaths as we embraced and kissed again.
