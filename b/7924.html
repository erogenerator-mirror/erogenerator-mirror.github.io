I want the most beautiful girl you have ever had and I want to make it last,' said Liana, her hands fidgeting between her legs and up to my face. 'Can I do that for you darling, please?' she whispered.</p> <p>I felt my whole body responding to Liana's words and when she touched me I felt my cock hardening with anticipation and growing. Then she slipped two fingers into my pussy, wetting them, and they reached my virgin hole. I felt Liana's nails scratch me there several times, sending goosebumps down the soft skin below me. Just the touch of Liana's hand made my whole body tingle with excitement, and her eyes shone with excitement when she told me to open myself to her finger, which she did with relish.</p> <p>'It's time,' Liana said, 'to really make love.'</p> <p>She took her fingers away from my opening and put them on to the side of the bed where I had my knees down and bent them back. She raised my legs up to my chest and looked deeply at her target. She dipped her fingers deeply into me and then drew them out and down and over the soft skin between my cunt and my arse, circling my anus as she did so. My whole body arched with the pleasure of her touch, and I tried to spread myself to her fingers, wanting her to go deeper.</p> <p>But Liana made me wait. She wanted to make me wait for something other than her touch, so she moved away from me. I felt very afraid of her, but at the same time she was so desirable and the pleasure of Liana's fingers was so enticing. I felt her hands behind me again but she left them there for only a few seconds. Now she moved her hands up to my breasts, caressing and squeezing my small hard pink nipples, making them taut and erect. I felt them tighten, so I pushed my head down and gave in to the pleasure she put me so hard I could hardly feel it.</p> <p>My heart pounded madly from the excitement and the excitement of the moment. I felt a strong urge to lie down and lay it back into the bed, to give her the release she craved, so I did so, laying there like that for what seemed like a long time. The heat of the moment was intense and, by that time, I was sure, it was going to be a most wonderful time, and I would be hers for an eternity.</p> <p>I felt contentment but the reality of it struck at me again. I knew that if I allowed my body to go wild like I was now, it would enjoy the rest of her, she would love me, and I would never want to stop loving her, I thought. But I wanted to get as much satisfaction as she had done. I felt I should take my eyes from my body, because I knew what was coming next and how it would be.</p> <p>I was so happy to see her come back, but I was nervous when she started to put my legs up on her shoulders and my knees at the bottom of the bed. My feet were still on the other side of the flatness of the bed, so I waited a few seconds more. Then I felt something new; something that surprised me, I thought, as I felt myself being lifted by my arms and then being pushed towards the end of the bed. For a second I felt nervous, but then I saw Liana standing there, looking at me in this most vulnerable position. I sensed she was looking at my own body lying on the bed between us, and that she was enjoying the sight of me there in her arms.</p> <p>This took me back to earlier, when I got this idea of Liana and me to be together. But now it was real, and it made me go weak in the knees and felt like I would fall. Liana kissed me on the lips, but not on my face, just on my face. Then she kissed me everywhere, the sides of my breasts, all over my tummy and my waist, even between my legs. Finally I felt myself being opened and her tongue gently stroking me there which made me feel very warm.</p> <p>But then Liana pushed me slowly from the top of the bed. I felt the mattress tremble and knew that my body was slowly being pulled over the edge of the bed, away from the top of the bed altogether. It made me shudder. Then she pushed me down and then I watched as she reached her hands inside hers and lifted my body to hers. She held my face in her hands and kissed me on the lips, then whispered, 'Take my hands off. Please, please don't make me wait. If you kiss me again, so please, please, I haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
