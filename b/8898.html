Two more men had entered as well. She smiled at them as she stood up. "Come. You're not ready enough yet." Her hands were still around his waist. She gave the man a friendly squeeze before turning back to leave. She walked away, walking to his side of the car, smiling and smiling until she reached the entrance. As she stepped in the door, the man stepped out from behind him. She turned around and leaned in close. He reached out and placed his hands on hers. Their embrace was tense. She was about to go inside the car and he was about to enter her. Her heart was fluttering, she smiled to herself. She had always done it with some force. "It was my first time with a man. I did it with a woman. The woman was not only interested in the fact that I had the ability to make people happy, but, as she is quite fond of saying, a man's power can't just disappear completely. That woman was more than happy to find it. I could see her eyes twinkling. They were sparkling in the light. I wondered if they had done what she was asking. She wanted more than the one man. The two of them were having too much fun.</p> <p>“What do you want to do?” Her voice was quivering. He did not want this. Not at all. He wanted her. Yes... yes... not yet. But, then, he wanted to continue tonight. He wanted her so bad it felt like he would fuck and fuck until he came. How could he leave her when she wanted him? "Well, you can fuck my ass, if you want." He thought of how much he enjoyed that idea. She giggled again. "You are so good,” he thought of his tongue that had caressed her pussy. Her thighs wrapped around his face. She loved it. He was glad she had worn a condom. As they drove away, he thought of her. He could still feel the pleasure of being inside her. He could feel her nipples pushing against him. Her thighs holding his as she leaned against him. His hardness in between her legs. In the darkness. What a feeling. The sound of her moans as he pressed between her legs. The feel of her soft touch. The way her breath tickled his ear.</p> <p>As they pulled up at her driveway the first light of the day dawned. He was already getting cold, so the drive home was short. The wind was strong, and seemed to come out of nowhere. A car was still in the driveway. A car in the garage. A man was standing looking at them, probably looking at someone as they pulled up. He did not even look back as he turned and began walking toward them. He stopped when he saw her. “Did you have a good night’?” She looked at him, her eyes pleading with him. She was a vision of loveliness and happiness with her pale skin. He loved what he saw. The only thing that made his cock hard anymore was the look in her eyes. They gave him a look of love in return. He smiled back at her. And kissed her deeply as his hand moved around behind her and gripped her ass cheek. They walked toward each other, kissing softly and passionately until he could feel her hand reaching for the back of his neck. He pulled away, as her breath ragged. It was still morning, and as his arousal subsided a little, he took his hand in hers. As they stood, their hands began to feel each other. His fingers traced the outline of her ass until she was as wet as he had hoped, as hard as he had expected, and she was very aroused. As if to confirm his suspicion, she pulled away and said he should walk inside.</p> <p>He walked toward her. He could even feel her fingers rubbing his cock, as she whispered to him that he was too good. He pulled her toward the bedroom while she wrapped her legs around his waist. “I know,” he said when they were righted against her, just outside the door. “You can just come into my room this morning, I’ll be right there.” Both knew why he said that. They also knew that he had already cum inside her, which would give her an additional chance to get him off this night. They were both so turned on by the anticipation of what this evening would bring.</p> <p>Once in the bedroom, he sat on the bed with his legs straddling her hips—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
