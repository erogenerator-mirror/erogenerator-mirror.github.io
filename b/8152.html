The only things I did for that afternoon were the occasional visit to the grocery store, grocery shopping trips with my new friend from the beach, the weekly shopping trips with friends at the local supermarket, all these things and more. But, I wanted more.</p> <p>I pulled my pants back on. We weren't the only couple I had taken into the night. We had been with a whole group of guys that had been in my house, but they hadn't been with me. This was really my first time. As we got out of our dresses we ran our fingers over each other's bodies all the while talking about something we knew we had never before done.</p> <p>"Oh, look, the guy I've been with, he's back!"</p> <p>"Oh, yes!"</p> <p>"Where is he?"</p> <p>"Well, he says, I guess, you know, I don't know how much he can take."</p> <p>"You know what, he is right." I thought of how hot he was and how big of a turn on it made me feel to be with him. That's right, we just met. His body is so much bigger, more muscular and in the middle of the crowd, he had such a nice body.</p> <p>We both ran out the door and found our hotel room the next day. We had slept on the couch, but it was still pretty early. I was a bit disappointed at the first night's activities. They had been great. But, what should have me feeling sore tomorrow is going to be more than sexâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
