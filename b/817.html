I asked, a little confused.</p> <p>"I've thought about it a lot," she admitted. "And I'm not sure I'd want to have sex with me in the same way that I want to with you, but..."</p> <p>I felt my heart skip a beat at that admission. I was glad I didn't have too many words. "And how does that balance something that was pretty far for you, and making that change?"</p> <p>"You're a lot more direct than I would have thought," she said. "I felt it as soon as I realized you were the man I wanted. To be honest, I could have done with more, and if I'd been able to, yes!"</p> <p>"Maybe I'm just too smart for that."</p> <p>"But what do you want now? What have you got for me?"</p> <p>She hesitated. Finally, I said "You've got sex with men, I don't get it?"</p> <p>It came out more of a question than a statement. "No, I didn't," she said. "I meant what I said, I'm sure," she added.</p> <p>"It is," I told her. "But I don't think I want to share that with you, either. I've already done that with Tom, too. But..."</p> <p>"Don't," she said.</p> <p>"No, no, no," I told her, trying to hold back. "That's not even what I said. I don't want to be a disappointment for the rest of our relationship. Or for myself."</p> <p>She got up. "Have a nice shower," she said. "And maybe we can be together again."</p> <p>"I don't want to do that yet," I said. "I already talked to Tom and he agreed to us having a threesome," I explained. "We're still having a lot to work through," I added hastily.</p> <p>She stood there. There were tears in her eyes. "I guess you could say I still love him," she said sadly. "I'm sorry," she said more softly this time, "that it happened. I should have said."</p> <p>I shook my head. "I'm sorry for your feelings," I said to her. "Now it's time for your bath."</p> <p>"Thank you, but I'm okay. It was..." She said it very slowly, and I could see her mind, a little blank.</p> <p>"No, its not okay. We just have to live this out. I think it's time that you shared that part of the deal," I said, knowing she wanted to share something else. "I'll be okay," I assured her. "I promise." I couldn't argue with her decision, so I gave her a bit of a parting shot.</p> <p>I stood up. "And I think your wish, your desire," I said, "is for us to get together again," I added, hoping it wasn't the only part that was clear in my head. I thought to myself that maybe a couple more nights wouldn't hurt any more, so I added a bit of a smile. "Don't get the idea that we can get together again, either. It would just be another night."</p> <p>I turned and started putting some clothes on. "This isn't really a way to make the deal," she said.</p> <p>"I can be a lot of time away," I told her, "but I just can't think of having you back at the hotel any longer without..."</p> <p>"Not at all." She kissed my cheek, then my cheek, and her lips again. "You're a wonderful man, and I know you really mean it."</p> <p>******</p> <p>"Well, well," Tom said as we left the building and started looking around. "Not much else to do. You can come in a couple minutes later."</p> <p>Julia opened the front door as we approached the car. It was a good thing he had already changed cars, because she was going to need a new one. She had been a little late getting home, since she wanted to use the master shower while we were working on the room. She got in the drivers seat and told me to put the trunk in the middle. "What to do?" she asked. "If I do this right, there's enough room for both of us."</p> <p>"I'll do everything right," I said. Since it was only the weekend, it was the first day for the party. It wasn't a huge event, but the place was kind of packed. "How would you like to stay home with me in one of the guest rooms?" I asked.</p> <p>"How doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
