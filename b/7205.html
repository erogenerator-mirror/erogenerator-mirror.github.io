Even though my hands were in hers and her breasts were in my hands, the rain made it difficult to move, but we managed. We stumbled into the bedroom and lay there, my hand between her legs fondling her labia, which were swollen with anticipation. I kissed her throat, tasting her sweat on her pale skin, and down to her breasts. I licked and sucked on her nipples, savoring her heavy breathing. She began to grind herself against me, her thighs quivering and twitching.</p> <p>"I need a cock in me," she whispered, and my hand pulled away from sucking on her nipple.</p> <p>I sat up and moved between her legs. I gently spread her lips and gazed at her vagina. It was very pink, very pink, and wet. I placed my nose against her clitoris, and she took hold of my cock, holding it down in her hand. She positioned it at the tight opening of her vagina, and then she gently pushed it into her. She cried out in surprise and ecstasy as I entered her. I pushed again and again, sliding in all the way. I continued my gentle stroking, enjoying the feel of her soft vagina.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she whimpered. "Fuck me hard."</p> <p>And I obliged. We got into a rhythm, and I began to move deeper with each thrust. "Oh, God," she cried out, "fuck me hard ... hard ... hard!"</p> <p>I was getting very aroused, as it seemed to me I was entering the heaven I was dreaming of, but her body and her orgasm did not seem to want it, neither did her voice, so I took matters in my hands and drove into her. She cried out in orgasm, but I knew not how much pleasure she was getting as her body pulsated around my cock, and she was not making any sound even at the end.</p> <p>I knew she must be cumming.</p> <p>When she finally recovered, I said, "Let's get back in the tub."</p> <p>There was absolutely no reason for us to swim together, and I took her in my arms and kissed her, then took her by the hands. She climbed on me and began to slowly kiss and caress my chest. She kissed my breasts, slowly working her way down to my naval - her kisses were so tender and intimate that I gasped with pleasure. She then kissed her way past my pubic hair, towards my clit. In one movement, she kissed my clit and I cried aloud, as I came hard on her tongue, my body shaking so much that I actually collapsed on her and felt all my blood go into my body.</p> <p>The next day, we woke up late, spent all the waking hours together, fucking like wild animals. We kept it quiet for a fortnight, and we were able to keep our affair at the end of it, although we started coming up with other men in the same way and eventually we got used to it. She didn't want sex with me, and made a deal with me, asking that I keep her on. The sex was the greatest thing I ever done with anyone - at least that I could ever imagine - and we were still having our affair. We were going to be together every night, she promised. Our life together lasted much of the summer, and we managed to forget about the events of our relationship and what we were doing.</p> <p>But at last we got back into the family, and we all felt good about ourselves.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, our affair developed and we found that it was the most exciting and exciting thing we had ever known.</p> <p>When she invited herself down for a barbecue in the summer, I told her to not stay up too late, and that I would see her when she was free.</p> <p>* * * * * * * *</p> <p>After that second barbecue for the children, and after a lot of talking and getting comfortable with each other, Karen felt we needed to go to bed soon.</p> <p>We were both feeling the stress of being apart from the relationship for so long, and it was not a good time for it to end.</p> <p>We kissed again, and then I felt her hand slip down and inside my robe. I groaned as I realized how she was feeling, and she broke the kiss and took my hand to pull me to the side, and we collapsed onto the bed.</p> <p>"I want you," she groaned.</p> <p>We kissed again, and she pulled my face towards hers and we kissed again.</p> <p>She pulled my robe open as far as it would let, and herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
