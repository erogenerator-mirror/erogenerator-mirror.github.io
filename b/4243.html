I love you!" She whispered to him, the love in her heart evident in her voice.</p> <p>He grabbed his pants and slipped them on. He walked around the bed to the bed as if he had never left, and opened his arms for her. "Come, I will let you in," he said as he hugged her lovingly once more.</p> <p>As he opened the door he found her leaning over the bed wearing her tank top, her hair was disheveled, she looked so good, so sexy.</p> <p>"Wow!" He said as he looked at her, "You're a real beauty!"</p> <p>They kissed again as he led her to the door. As they walked out, they looked back over at the bedroom and saw the couple on the bed enjoying the feel of each other's bodies as they made out.</p> <p>He put a hand on her ass and pulled her close for another kiss.</p> <p>She reached up and ran it down the length of his back, pausing only to grasp his ass cheek hard enough to pull him closer. He pushed the button on his button fly as he put his hands in her hair and leaned her back to the door. His hard cock was pressed against her stomach, his erection pressing against it and sending hot flames straight to her sex as he kissed her again.</p> <p>"My turn," he said as he pushed her back, the kisses becoming more forceful.</p> <p>When he got her up, he reached into his pants pocket, and pulled out a condom, something that would be obvious to any passerby, "You go first," he said as he opened the condom and took a breath.</p> <p>She looked around for the little blue pill, "It's still here!" she said as she took one out of her purse.</p> <p>He helped her off the bed and she walked into the bathroom to take it off, "Hurry, it's time to take your time." He laughed as he watched her, her ass bouncing with every step.</p> <p>She came out of the bathroom, still a little winded, and she stood in the doorway for a few moments, looking around for her clothes. When he took one of her shoes off, she turned around to get the second of shoes while he slipped out of his shirt and undid his jeans. She could see his hard cock straining against his underwear, she loved it when men had a hard cock in their underwear as a result of a hard day's work. She was a little tipsy and almost felt like she wanted to take care of the situation. He laid a hand on her arm and helped her put her shoes on.</p> <p>"Here, grab these, and go get those panties," he said as he handed her the second pair.</p> <p>She was standing in a white pair with pink lace trim and satin lace trim and she could see the tops of his full cock, she loved how it bulged against the black lace material and the way it hugged his full manhood. She felt herself getting wet, as she did so she realized she didn't really remember this outfit. She knew it was a simple white outfit, with no white on underneath, with black panties and a bra. She grabbed her panties before she left, "Here is your bra," he said, "That'll fit you."</p> <p>'Oh, I can't wait to do this!" she thought as she put them on. She looked up at him and winked playfully as she sat on the edge of the bed to put on her bra. She pulled it up and looked at herself in the mirror. "Wow, you look amazing." She said as she watched herself in the mirror. Her chest was round and beautiful, her legs were long and her ass was pretty round too. Her hair was falling in the front of her now. She looked back over to the bed, and saw that he had taken a moment to take off his shirt and boxers and was naked. She felt a bit of trepidation as she did so from knowing this man.</p> <p>"You ready?" he asked as he sat next to her on the bed.</p> <p>"Sure," she said, reaching up to touch his erection as she reached her hand and felt the smooth skin of his body.</p> <p>"There is a spare dresser over there," he said as he stood, pulling her down to the bed. He sat down beside her and lifted her chin to him.</p> <p>"Where do you want me to sit?" she asked looking around for something. He pointed to the empty spot beside the bed. "Here," he said as he put his hand in her hair and pulled it back. "Hold that hair," he said as he pulled her head back as he stood up and pulled the hair up to his shoulders.</p> <p>"Here," he said pulling the back of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
