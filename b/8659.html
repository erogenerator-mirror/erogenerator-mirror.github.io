Keep stroking my dick," he said.</p> <p>I felt very self indulgent as I slid his dick further in my mouth. I sucked him like it was the most fun thing to do. I licked and kissed his dick head with a warm soft tongue. I couldn't believe that I was doing this, but it was all I could do to keep quiet. He pulled my hips closer to his and began to slowly hump my mouth and tongue.</p> <p>The feeling was so intense. His warm, smooth cock felt so good in my mouth. I wanted more. I needed more. I wanted to please them. I felt like someone was driving me crazy. I let my tongue work faster and faster, and then I stopped all motion. I moved my mouth so that only the head of his dick still rested outside my lips.</p> <p>I looked up at him to see his expression. He looked at me with a smile. He then opened the door a little wider to reveal a small bathroom and a room with a shower stall that he closed.</p> <p>I quickly slipped off the condom. I took everything off. I stood naked, face up, with a huge grin on my face.</p> <p>"Oh my," was all he said.</p> <p>He then pointed out my breasts. He grabbed my breasts and I began to massage them slowly. I then began to rub my nipples with my fingers. I put them in his big hands to feel them again.</p> <p>"Mmm," was all he said.</p> <p>He then reached for me and pulled me up so that I was standing on the shower wall. Our water flowed down both of our bodies, over our faces, and over each other. He rubbed my back with his hands, up, down, and around my breasts. He kissed me back. I could feel his dick pressing lightly against my stomach. I let my hands move upwards to his chest. He grabbed my breasts and caressed them.</p> <p>"This is so nice," was all he said.</p> <p>I started kissing down his neck to his chest. I slowly moved my mouth from his dick over his stomach to his abdomen. I felt that I was really enjoying him. He was rock hard and hot as I licked around his navel. I kissed it once then moved upwards to that spot. And then my eyes moved to his thick penis in front of my face.</p> <p>I opened my mouth as I licked the head of his dick and then closed my lips around it. I rubbed my tongue around it. As I pulled off, I could hear his breathing change a bit. I then took it back into my warm wet mouth.</p> <p>I sucked the tip of his dick, but only the very tip. I wanted him to cum in my mouth. I wanted to feel his cock cum hard into my hand. I wanted to feel the cum in my mouth. I then got about half of his dick into my mouth, and then took the entire head into my mouth. I sucked hard when my mouth was full of his cock juice and let his rod slide slowly out slowly to see the shine on his pubic hair.</p> <p>"Oh, you're so wet!" he exclaimed.</p> <p>I felt myself getting excited that I had taken something that had been so hard. I just smiled to myself. I went back down on his cock again. I could feel it throbbing in my mouth. I was getting extremely aroused also.</p> <p>He then took over the pace. His pelvis met my lips with his own. He went in completely. I could feel my head hitting his dick in the same rhythm of my licks. He started moving inside my mouth. He was pumping his ass to my hips. I could hear him breathing fast and panting.</p> <p>I took him as deep in my mouth as I could. I took his balls into my mouth. I rolled them on his dick.</p> <p>He put his hands over my head and held it tight against him. Then he slowly removed it from my mouth. He kissed my forehead, my eyes, and then my lips. He kissed each of mine with tenderness. But I was not done. His cock had been in so many ways. And after that whole time, I just wanted to take it all in.</p> <p>I pushed myself up so that he could see my face now. I was really getting into it.</p> <p>He then looked at me and smiled: "I knew you would enjoy that."</p> <p>I felt his finger rubbing my ass. It felt so good. I felt like I was on fire. I could feel him pressing on my hole, in and out... But I didn't let him move there. He got me down a bit. A drop of my juice was there, but it was all he had to do. And then I lifted my legs and put them beside his shoulders. He lifted me up and tookâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
