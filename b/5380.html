"When the weather's nice."</p> <p>And the rain fell.</p> <p>"Where do you stand with a date?" she asked.</p> <p>"You know that?" he grinned. "Why?"</p> <p>"I wanted to get into your pants," she said, giggling.</p> <p>"Yeah, well," he said, "I'm not really in a position to have a very long discussion with you right now."</p> <p>"It's not like that," she sighed. "It's just that we have to live with it, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he agreed, grinning, "but, seriously, don't you think we both know we could still get hot about it?"</p> <p>"You're right," she said. "I'm sorry, I just wanted to let you know. I have a surprise coming up tonight. And, I need to have some fun before it happens."</p> <p>"I'm still wondering what we can do," he said.</p> <p>"Well," she chuckled, "I can let you ask me anything and I'll answer for you."</p> <p>"I know you do." He sat next to her, feeling awkward. As soon as she looked up at him again, she kissed him lightly on the mouth. He smiled and pulled away.</p> <p>"I have to ask," he said, "how have you been?"</p> <p>"All right. I haven't had sex since the weekend," she answered him.</p> <p>"I'm very happy for you," he said earnestly. "So, what else do you have to say?"</p> <p>She sighed, looking away.</p> <p>"I'll be honest with you," she said. "I've been kind of surprised. I never get over the whole weekend though."</p> <p>"Me neither," he smiled.</p> <p>Her hair was plastered to her forehead, which was soaked from the rain and water. She was trying to wipe away the tears that had come to her eyes.</p> <p>"I was not that good, even to you," she continued. "I wasn't even close to being good. I had sex with you and got really into it though, I mean, a lot."</p> <p>"So, now, I have to ask something of you."</p> <p>"Please don't ask me to tell you," she said.</p> <p>"I just hope it doesn't hurt too much," he replied. "You could have had me all weekend if you wanted to. But, please, I'd really like to hear about it."</p> <p>"Please?" he repeated. "Please don't think that you have to tell me anything. I wouldn't hurt you either. It's only fair to me."</p> <p>"Oh, I promise," she smiled. "I won't tell until you're really hurt, and ask me again?"</p> <p>"You want to talk about something that you had to go through, right?" He asked seriously.</p> <p>"No," she said, gently.</p> <p>"Okay, then," he said. "You think I can't help you? Just the thought makes you wet all over again."</p> <p>He stood, making her sit so his face was next to hers and he kissed her gently. She kissed him back and he held her close. She slid her hands up his chest and he rolled down the sheet to her waist.</p> <p>"Now, it's my turn to ask about this surprise."</p> <p>She sat up and reached behind to remove her tee shirt. They stood there for a minute in the hot sun, naked except for their socks and jeans. He was still on his back, but looked up at her as she looked at him.</p> <p>"And, I've been asking you, haven't I?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, smiling at her. "I can't believe how much," he added. "All the years I can't get you alone I can hardly think about it," he said with a laugh.</p> <p>She giggled and looked around.</p> <p>"I'll be damned if I'm going to stop now," she smiled.</p> <p>He chuckled, and then reached out and kissed her gently, but firmly. Their kiss started out gentle but deep, then it got a little rougher in its intensity, and her hands slid up his chest. He pulled her to him, letting his fingers trail along her neck and up to tease her ear before descending lower to her mouth.</p> <p>She turned on her back for him, and he began to kiss her breasts, kissing and sucking each nipple in turn. She arched her back slightly, offering him more of her breasts. As his lips traveled higher to her neck, his kisses grew bolder, going lower to tease her navel and then onto her pussy. He felt her legs part for him.
