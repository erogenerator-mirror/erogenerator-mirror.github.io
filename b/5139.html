She always found Jack so sexy. She'd been amazed at the fact that he wasn't a real man, and yet at the same time, he knew that in order to survive on her diet, he must have a big cock, and she found that it could handle anything. "You mean that you still feel that way?" she said.</p> <p>"For one thing, yes. That's true. It's just the way I am. I need a bigger cock. We know." He smiled down at her and said, "So I'm just gonna need to practice how to keep from being able to do it. Just relax, baby. Relax." Then he got up and walked to the small kitchenette and got a washcloth and came back. He held it out for Tif to wipe with and began, "Now I'm gonna go easy on you. You can get used to it. You'll get used to it, trust me." He was looking at her with a smile when he said it, and she found that she was already getting wet, the feel of her lips being spread and the feel of him filling her made her even wetter.</p> <p>"You want me to lick you now, don't you?" he asked, with that little chuckle she liked best.</p> <p>"You know I'll just lie down on my stomach and you can lick me in places as good as that." He laughed, and then he went back to the kitchenette to get some more lotion and another bottle of lotion. "Just relax, baby. I'm gonna do that to you, and you're just gonna lie still." Then he was back, but he used the washcloth again to rub this stuff over her, and then back to her, stopping at the edge of her ass, and working the lotion into her and her hole. She started to wiggle her ass slightly as he worked his fingers in there, his fingers never moving too far in her open up hole. Soon he was working his fingers in and out of her and he pulled it out, turning to look at her with a grin, then went back to rubbing the lotion in with his hand.</p> <p>"I'm gonna stop now," he said, and she heard him say it in a way that made her want him to fuck her ass, but not too soon. She couldn't take much more of what he was going to do. "Just lay there," he told her, and she heard him walk away from the table.</p> <p>She felt him get a good, solid hold on her waist, and then she felt his cock slowly slide through in front of her face, then he was moving it around in small circles in her face. She started to get a little uneasy, like when he slid her a drink, so she said, "Can I just use my fingers?"</p> <p>"You're ready for this. Now relax. Relax." Before he had left the kitchenette she had felt him pull the washcloth out from under her and wiped her with it, so it wasn't something she said, but she didn't object to all of it being done. "I think you better get me the bottle," he said. "I'll be right back." And he walked back out and returned with the bottle. He held it out for her, and she took it as she looked around, wondering if she'd ever be able to actually feel it. She shook her head as she looked for a place to breathe and the place where he was, where he needed to put it, the place where he needed to put his weight on her back.</p> <p>When she did feel all of the weight, her mouth just let out a sigh as he lifted her on to her stomach and began to lay on top of her, rubbing his belly and shoulders on to her back. He reached his hand around her, one arm under her, pulling her into him as he reached the base of his cock, then he held it there for a moment. "I'm not gonna come into you," he said quietly, but firmly.</p> <p>Tiffany opened her eyes for a moment, staring at his cock. "It looks like..." she started.</p> <p>"It looks hard, baby," a man said softly, a bit more forcefully than she remembered.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. She reached up to touch him, it was hard, really hard, and felt like he had his arm around her as he pulled her body into him. "You're so hard," she whispered.</p> <p>"You like being in me, don't you, baby?" he said, letting the hard, swollen head of his cock rub between her lips. "Do you like my big dick in your pussy?"</p> <p>She nodded yes, but the sound that followed was more a long moment of silence. "Do you like what I'm doing to you?" he asked gently.
