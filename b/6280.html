Her hips swayed as she looked at the television, wondering how long this would take to get over with.</p> <p>"Let's go back," she said, "I still can't believe I'm here." The movie was about a school-girl getting a blowjob by the boyfriend.</p> <p>"It has to look like it's in the back of what's a TV!" he answered eagerly. Sylvia knew that even on a computer screen, one of the women might be on one. Her eyes were drawn to what she saw when he'd said 'blowjob.' She looked closer at it once for a moment. The girl was in the throes of passion, his cock being sucked and his cum spurting onto her face. Sylvia smiled. At the time, the idea of what she did was not the real idea but the movie, she knew, was. The image that would make her come was her doing it. Sylvia held in her breath for a long moment. She felt as she had a sexual fever building.</p> <p>"You're going to come!" Mr. Peters said. Sylvia nodded, her eyes wide. She looked at the camera.</p> <p>"I'm going to go take a look in the bathroom," she said. "See if there are any girls that can get me up." She stood up abruptly. It wasn't a gesture to show what an erection Mr. Peters had made. Sylvia walked toward the bedroom.</p> <p>"Do you want anything?" he asked her, looking around the room for some kind of towel to wrap in and put something on her. She shrugged. She had a nice shape. He sat down beside the couch and picked up some tissues. "I don't usually go for this type of thing," he said. As they talked he got more comfortable, his hands reaching up, sliding his fingers under her arms. He held her hands and slid them down his chest. His hands slid past her boobs, over the bottom of the top, under the waist and to her lower belly. His hands glided through her pubic hair. He touched the end of his penis, rubbing his index finger over her clitoris.</p> <p>"Wow," said Sylvia. She looked at the screen. It was still playing a porn movie. Suddenly, she was back on her knees with him, facing the camera. It was another girl. Sylvia was very much aware at the time of her breasts exposed to Mr. Peters. She looked up at him, almost in shock.</p> <p>"What do you think of the title," he asked. Sylvia looked at the title image for a moment. It was a girl, she thought, a girl with a big breasts, with dark brown pubic hair trimmed and spread out. Her labia were red and swollen. "Oh, yes," Sylvia said, her hands on her thighs.</p> <p>"I really wanted to see it," he said. Sylvia looked away. She was thinking about the title and the porn movie and about her fantasies. "It looks real," he said.</p> <p>She nodded. "Yes," she whispered.</p> <p>"It feels real," he said. Mr. Peters had his middle finger in her vagina and he worked up to her clitoris for a few seconds. Sylvia looked at it. She thought about when Bill was with them. She thought of the times she'd watched him as he licked it. But there was a part of her that liked it. It didn't do her much to feel good. She got turned on when she heard the sound of him and it did make her warm a little. She didn't know how to explain it but, well, she was turned on. Sylvia's hands were still on her thighs. "Is it a guy, or do they have any hair?" she asked. Mr. Peters' hand slid up her thigh, touching her pubic hair at the top. Sylvia looked up at the movie and a moment later she was looking at the girl on her knees, her tongue swirling against her clitoris. She had a man, she thought, but he had a girl. Her other hands were still on her thighs, stroking herself.</p> <p>"That sounds just fine," he said. Sylvia looked at the picture and it looked real, too. She couldn't believe that the young girl on the screen was having a guy, the one she'd gotten to know, kiss her. Her eyes widened. She wanted to say something, anything. But she didn't. It felt weird, she realized. She still felt shy and a little embarrassed at what she'd done. She didn't know why she said it.</p> <p>"I mean, you probably don't even know how to do it, do girls just have guys do that?" Mr. Peters asked.</p> <p>She shook her head.
