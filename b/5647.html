They stopped when they heard her and she blushed. They looked into her eyes and she smiled.</p> <p>"Hi, how is it?"</p> <p>They came back to the subject at hand and she agreed that it was OK. They were looking into her eyes when she noticed her hands move to cover her bare breasts.</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"Your hands, what are you doing?"</p> <p>"I.. uh, I.. uh, I can't do it here."</p> <p>They both laughed at her as she moved her hands away.</p> <p>"Let's just play for a little while. You're naked under here and all you're wearing is your panties." He said looking at the front of them.</p> <p>She blushed at his words and stood up. "OK, so I've got to get these clothes off?"</p> <p>He shrugged and turned his back towards her. "I'll do that, OK."</p> <p>They watched as she stepped into her panties. Once again she took a step as she turned, but this time he was right behind her and she heard an appreciative chuckle in his voice. They went to the pool table. The next game was a turn for the wicked. They both had a laugh but one of the men wanted to put his drink to his crotch but it was clear from their expressions at the table that they were trying to get out.</p> <p>The winner of the turn pulled the drinks out of his pocket and handed the cards. He turned and looked at her. She smiled and moved towards him. His arm wrapped around her and pulled her close. His lips met hers and he kissed her deeply. His arms tightened around her waist and she leaned in to his embrace. They kissed their breath mingling as his fingers caressed her back, sliding down over her ass. She reached up and ran her fingers up and through his hair as he pulled her into him. When their lips parted, she looked at him. He pulled away from the kiss and smiled.</p> <p>"Not this time, there's nothing under here!"</p> <p>"No problem. I'm really looking forward to it!" She replied</p> <p>"Can we do it on the table"</p> <p>"You mean, do you want me to eat you out?"</p> <p>"Sure. Of course, we can watch if you want." He grinned.</p> <p>"No we can't!" She looked at him trying to decide. "I told you we have to be naked. We need to be naked all the time! Come on!" She said reaching for his belt buckle.</p> <p>He grinned as he pushed her away again and dropped down to floor level. His eyes followed her as she kicked off her sandals and stepped out of them. She looked back at him and smiled as her fingers reached under the bottom of her t-shirt, pulled the cloth up over her breasts and slid the panties down. Her hands came back and she held her breasts up in the air. They were pale and pink at the edges, with a little blush of brown to them. She had a slightly puffy nipple and her brown areola glistened in the sunlight. Her breasts looked small, smaller than she preferred.</p> <p>"I don't think I'll be able to keep this up!" He said as he looked at her naked body.</p> <p>She laughed and smiled back at him. "The shorts are in the bottom drawer!"</p> <p>"It looks like you forgot the pair of underwear I got in the mail!" He said as he pulled his t-shirt off and tossed it in the bathroom.</p> <p>She turned around and smiled as she looked at the mirror. "Honey, I'll come out here and watch you strip for me if you will."</p> <p>"I don't think I can get naked in front of anyone else."</p> <p>"All of them, please! You will get to see all of these people naked!"</p> <p>"There is one thing, though... I want to see you totally naked!"</p> <p>"You don't have to, I'd tell you that right now!" She looked at him over her shoulder. "If you don't mind, let me just hang out out here."</p> <p>He grinned and nodded. "OK, you can hang out here if you want."</p> <p>"I'd really love to if you'd come outside."</p> <p>"It would be my pleasure." He said and they both stepped over the pool table.</p> <p>She reached and he dropped his shorts down to his ankles. She stood with her hands on her hips and her chest heave out. She looked out at them for a second, then reached down and pulled the white bikini panties down. They flew away with them and they dropped to the floor with her shoes. She looked down at herself as she looked her up and downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
