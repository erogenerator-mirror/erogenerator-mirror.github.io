I asked my wife. She smiled again, "yes. They've always kept her happy so the kids get a lot of free time too," she said, "even when they had a girlfriend out.</p> <p>"Well, I'm the one getting away from here," I said. I felt bad, but it wasn't because I didn't want to stop the sex, it was because it was what it was. Her mind seemed to have become more rational now, but I was too far gone to be bothered, so I decided to stop and let it happen.</p> <p>"So...we should tell her about you and her, can you?" she asked again. I nodded. "You do realize she's only seen you around the office," she said, "you shouldn't have been in so much trouble before, I thought for sure you were a good friend." I was still thinking this when we arrived in her office. She had some papers in a folder.</p> <p>"Well, you might be right," she said excitedly, "But I want to tell her about your business," she added with a nervous laugh. "Let's wait," she said, "we'll finish this in here, and then I'll come back here and watch us play."</p> <p>I was pretty shocked at the suggestion; it sounded so much like her talking about me or just that she'd have to watch me, but at the same time I was excited, and I started kissing the top of her hand, waiting for her response.</p> <p>I thought I heard some slight hesitation and she finally spoke again. "Can I ask you something," she said. "Tell me about your business in person please," she said. I nodded.</p> <p>"Well, my idea is that we were going to have a small party, and since there was a lot of talking going on and a really good party being had, we decided to give our first one a try, for the first time of course," she said laughing, "but since we had talked about it, you and I are going to go to some of the big parties on Friday, and we can start going there in a day or two."</p> <p>"I thought you wanted to, huh? You want me to take him out on a nice long swing in an afternoon?" I said, my thoughts and emotions clearly on edge. She gave me a puzzled look. I smiled at her, her face becoming flushed. I looked at her, "you didn't realize?"</p> <p>She looked down, a little embarrassed. "It was fun. I thought I'd like to try it out. But this thing with you and your wife would ruin it forever," she said. I shook my head while thinking it over.</p> <p>"Well, I'll be ready...let's meet you here," I said. I was excited, I was excited about the whole episode, I was excited about tonight and what she would do to me.</p> <p>On the drive to the party, I didn't get out of my car until we arrived in her office.</p> <p>"So," she said, smiling up at me. "How did you like his swing?"</p> <p>"Oh...uh, wow, that would really be kind of exciting," I said, still a little unsure of myself, but also excited...it turned me on.</p> <p>She leaned forward for the paper she was looking for, "here let me give it to you as well." So I leaned forward to read the paper, but I couldn't find the pages anywhere.</p> <p>"Honey...the pages on the top of your chart are for you," she said, "not my notes," she added with a wink. I couldn't help but smile at her as she leaned way forward.</p> <p>I stood up slowly from my chair, and looked at the paper again. "You have any idea? That's the size of the words on the top of that chart," I said.</p> <p>"I think it's about the size of 1, and the letters are very neat on the edges."</p> <p>I nodded again as I went to my desk to get the chart.</p> <p>When I returned with the sheet, the first thing I found, was a small tube that seemed to have a number printed below the top, and a black plastic object that looked like lipstick, with a red pencil on the inside.</p> <p>"What is that?" I asked, while looking into the tube.</p> <p>"This is a lipstick, and it is called a 'come-hither' lipstick," she said. I had never heard of a lipstick called a come-hither lipstick before, and it scared me.</p> <p>"No!" I said, "that's...it smells too..." but I knew what she was talking about.</p> <p>"It's part of your business," she said as she rubbed her lips together.
