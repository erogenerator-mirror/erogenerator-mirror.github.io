"I'm in the building on the 15th. My name is Sarah. This way."</p> <p>"Okay." I said, walking behind her. The door opened and we got in one of those black SUVs. With Sarah sitting on the driver's seat in first, my arm went around her, and her legs wrapped around mine. From where we were standing, I got a clear view of her crotch, which was quite a bit looser than most female bodies, but nevertheless had a good shape.</p> <p>"Well," she said, looking back over her shoulder, "this is a first date, then..." She shrugged as if to say "I'm always thinking ahead." Then, turning to face me, she said, "But, don't worry, you're not getting far," and then we were off.</p> <p>"This was a first date?" I said, thinking I had made it too far.</p> <p>"Just one," she said. "But, if you ever want to get into my pants, I'm sure you can do better."</p> <p>"Really? Would you like to?" I said, and she just rolled her eyes.</p> <p>"Naw. Besides, if you'd like, you wouldn't have to call me 'Sarah' now." She turned back to the window, then opened one of the passenger side doors, and stepped out, giving me a view of her pussy. It was so wet. I looked into the rear view mirror to see. "Wow, you're so fucking beautiful," I said, and she just smirked.</p> <p>"What?" she said, "And how the hell does all this make me so gorgeous?"</p> <p>"Well," I said. "If you can talk me into giving you a date." I didn't want to get into trouble. I just wanted to see her.</p> <p>"Of course, but it's pretty obvious you're not going to," she said, giving my hand a squeeze and taking a step forward.</p> <p>"So, Sarah," I said, "You want to show me a little something," and then I was back in front of her. Once again, I pushed her back against the door, and reached back to grab her boobs. My fingertips ran over them, cupping them, squeezing then teasing. I squeezed them hard and pulled at her nipples.</p> <p>Sarah just stared back, looking at the floor. Her lips were parted. "Oh, Mr. Bick," she said as she pushed my hands away from her breasts. "I am so flattered, that there is someone your age like you, and even, if you're older, I bet you're too old to be your... err." She trailed off, looking between my hands.</p> <p>"That's okay," I said, "I have my own age group of girls who were in their early 20's, not that I'm gonna be calling myself 'old', and I was always pretty old..."</p> <p>She looked up into my face and saw I was staring at those big boobs and not her face. "Oh, Mr. Bick," she said, giving me a little peck on the cheek. "I like your idea, of you to call me 'Sarah'." And without further prompting, she kissed me gently. Our lips met, and then broke it off suddenly. "We'd better get to the door first," Sarah said. "Mr. Bick wants me here tonight." I did not say anything. I just let her lead me toward the door.</p> <p>I heard that knocker outside. It was Sarah. I closed the door quietly and locked it. I turned to face Sarah, and took her lips with my hands, but she stopped me. "You're so hot, Sarah. It's kinda hard to believe you aren't your own age."</p> <p>"Really?" I said as I bent to kiss her. First she kissed me, then she slipped her tongue out and ran it up my lips, into my mouth, where it met mine. She grabbed me, squeezed me, while I kissed her. I wanted to say something, but she didn't let me go to fast. We kissed slowly at first, then she grabbed my shirt.</p> <p>"Let me," she said, and she stood back and unzipped it. I looked at her as she fumbled through the pockets of her jeans, getting my hands to come up and grab her ass. After that she grabbed my belt, and started to unbutton my pants.</p> <p>Oh, my life! I was really hard.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" I heard myself asking, "it isn't that."</p> <p>"I'm so hot," Sarah said, pulling my pants off, looking me up and down, "I can't believe I don't want you in the first placeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
