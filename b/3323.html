You're right that I'm not going out with you guys." she said turning the car around and heading towards a large white house on the other side of town.</p> <p>"Wow." I said and smiled. "I guess it was hard on her to be a slut?" I said and looked down at the ground and thought that since I was going to see Lisa get drunk the way she did, then maybe in that case I shouldn't be telling her I thought.</p> <p>"It's hard. Lisa would get pissed when I was telling her the same things as she is. She is such a dirty slut." she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I know. But I'm glad I said thank you." I said in the same tone of voice.</p> <p>"I do mean thank you. If you were going to go back to the office with me, and then see me with my friends, she would still be pissed you didn't even bring the alcohol." she said and got in the car.</p> <p>"No, I really do mean that. I'm just going to enjoy it." I said knowing that once she was drunk, she'd probably want me to make out. She wasn't drinking to get high and now even if it was what she was going to drink, as soon as she went back to the office she was going to start having fun and try to get me to go home with her. I'd know for sure by just going inside.</p> <p>"Maybe it's best if I did go home with you tonight." she said and pulled out of the parking lot. "And, I can make myself look and sound good" she added with a big grin.</p> <p>"You are something else. It's very sweet of you." I said back, and after pulling the car into my house I headed inside. It was nice living in a nice place. I didn't notice the note that was sitting on the table.</p> <p>"Lisa is still out with friends tonight. Her dad will be home soon and I need to go to work. I'd really like you getting home with me and seeing if we can find a way. Thank you for staying. I really did mean it though." she wrote and leaned back into me.</p> <p>"I'm really glad that you're able to make me feel good. Now I'm going to have to take care of you." she smiled, and got out of the car. "I'll catch you later" she said and walked around to the passenger side of the car and opened the door for me. I had no idea why she was leaving her car out in the middle of my front yard until she started driving in the opposite direction. When she pulled on to the street, she'd pull a few left turners off towards the houses that she'd just passed so that she would pass on to a side street.</p> <p>"What I do know is that I'm going to be a really good husband and father." she said as she pulled out of the driveway and turned towards my house. "We'll see." she said in her sexy voice.</p> <p>I followed her into the house and she locked the door and led me to the bedroom. "Lie down down on the bed." she said and I did as I was told. "I think I'm going to make myself come, now that I've been drinking again." she said and pulled the condom over my cock. I was a little surprised how quickly she had me do that. She started with me doing that with her while her finger found her clit and started working it on. She did this while I was licking her and I got her to cum again. After letting me finish, she told me to get out of the chair and lay down. I did just that while she looked at me and smiled knowing that I would feel better then in front of her. She then pulled back the covers and had me climb between her legs with my cock still between her legs. Her moans again caused my cock to stir again.</p> <p>"It's very nice to have you at my pussy again." She said as she looked around the room. "I don't know how I have never felt like this." she said and I realized suddenly that we weren't going to talk about her. The bed or the sheets.</p> <p>"We'll talk when we get home." I said as I stood up and put my hand on her hand pulling her to me. "Right now you're going to make me come." I said in a much calmer voice. She looked at me and smiled.</p> <p>"We'll do that. Right now I'm so close to cumming I have to touch it. You get on your back and I'll put the condom on." I told her as I climbed on the bed while her fingers continued to work on her clit and to her ass.
