There was a nice country home in the country and a bar in the next one. A large barn on the property. It was a perfect setup, for two people to have a place to live and not have to look for employment every month.</p> <p>"The barn is nice," she said. "It is nice to talk to the owner. And I can get it done in a couple of hours, if a few guys like it. I'll help you, if you want my help."</p> <p>"Sure, Mom, you got no reason to stay here. I know you can help me if I want," he said, trying to sound as convincing as possible. The big man was the closest thing to a real professional, just like his son! He made the suggestion on the spot.</p> <p>It would take her for a couple of hours, and when she came down for a shower, he would go talk to her, if she needed some help. She would give his offer a lot of thought.</p> <p>"Oh, that would be a little awkward. I can't do that in town."</p> <p>"It's in the country. I can do it, but you have to get up early and get to work," he explained to her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I'm not used to the place. I just had to get up so I could put my stuff away."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. There's a room upstairs, and some hot tub you can use. I'm sure you can think of something to do to get it going, for a while."</p> <p>"Thank you," she offered, as she headed up the stairs to use the bathroom.</p> <p>The guy who would be selling the barn next door to her was just putting the finishing touches on the renovations. He was going to sell the place from his office, and had a pretty good idea what to do with the property. He would work through the night, and return it to him when he retired. He knew there was room at some of the other property, so the barn wouldn't have to be in constant use. In case he really wanted to keep the place, he would buy the land for it. The barn would be a nice reminder for how successful he was.</p> <p>The first thing he needed to do was to get her address, and check in on her. She was his mother for god's sake, and that meant she had to meet him.</p> <p>She arrived fifteen minutes after he had, with the address.</p> <p>"So, you want to come up to my place?" he asked her.</p> <p>"I sure do," she replied, with her accent. "I can come anytime."</p> <p>They agreed to go in and wait for her.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, as she took his hand. "Let's go in there and have a drink."</p> <p>He followed her around the corner of the barn and down a hallway. She led him into the living room, and then they were on the sofa, having a glass of wine while she poured a large glass. He was getting more and more excited as the hours passed.</p> <p>"So, how's your day going so far?" she asked him.</p> <p>"It's great," he replied. "I was thinking about the job interview."</p> <p>"Haha, I remember. I remember everything from when we first met. But it seems we are both going to be here, waiting for you to sign them up," she offered, as she poured down the last of her glass for him. The last of it was already gone when she took his hands into hers, "Let's relax and enjoy our evening, while it lasts. We can tell you a lot about each other's lives before we have to start looking for other jobs."</p> <p>They finished their wine, and she turned around for him to kiss her. She pressed her lips against his for a long time, while making his dick twitch in his jeans as the electricity between them was almost unbearable. She was wearing an innocent and shy smile; and she had a sparkle in her eyes. He knew he shouldn't think about that, but the way he felt for her, it was a rare thing for men like this to act that way.</p> <p>"I don't expect you to say yes to this job," she whispered as she pressed her body closer to his, "but I have some things I need to explain to you."</p> <p>He wanted to grab her and hold her to him, but he was able to keep his hands on her neck and pull her face to his. He couldn't imagine being anywhere else with both of them at the same time. She closed her eyes and pushed her body against him, as he started making her hot with his kisses. She could feel his arousal pulsing through his pants, making her feel very eroticâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
