"You can still go see if you like it—you don't have to do that—the other night it was pretty awesome. You should try it again." She giggled as she finished her turn and I continued my journey of discovery.</p> <p>The story was actually pretty interesting although I'll admit that I didn't really get into it very much. I just got carried away with the characters, so they seemed very real. I don't know how long I sat there, just enjoying the conversation, but I was able to get a little of the fun out of it, too. It seemed like I was a total idiot for doing it, but then I was a natural at telling stories from friends and family and I just had no idea what to say to someone right after them. She was so open and fun and she was so cute as well; I couldn't really describe her. I think she was actually a bit younger than me and I had never really spoken to her until today.</p> <p>At last, we returned to the living room and there was a little more of her. She was sitting on the sofa with only a few buttons undone on her blouse. She was looking at me and smiling. Her smile was sexy but not so slutty and she also seemed to be totally uninterested in anything but my cock...or my eyes on hers. She leaned over and kissed my cheek. I was amazed.</p> <p>"You are pretty sexy when you're horny," she said, and then pulled my face back to kiss me again, though it was a gentle one as she did so. My cock was already hard and as she did so, she unbuttoned one of the buttons of my shirt and then pulled the garment off my shoulders and back. She was just too sexy to be trying to do it herself, but with the help of the alcohol she was able to remove it easily. As she straightened up a little, the skirt hem came lower, but only slightly, and was now bunched around my waist.</p> <p>"God you're gorgeous," I murmured, "I mean, who wouldn't want to get laid?"</p> <p>"Do it with him, too," she whispered and then turned away, leaving me staring at those pretty, pale legs. I was sure that I blushed as she walked to the bedroom. The way she sat and bent and moved back and forth was almost hypnotic and it gave me a strange sensation; she must have been masturbating when she was driving me insane. I watched as she sat on her bed and she leaned back against a pillows and smiled. "My God, I can't believe it's gone so long. I never knew this was as exciting as it was."</p> <p>I knew, too, that it had been gone so long between my first and second marriages. I'd thought that maybe getting married was the best part of a relationship and just having a girl out of a marriage was better than not having someone you loved. It hadn't really been that easy as I was still so much older. I hadn't thought of it until now and I still don't know what it was I was thinking or feeling.</p> <p>I wasn't disappointed at all. It felt good to have her out of her skirt and blouse, too. I could see that she was sitting on the bed. She was looking at herself in the mirror, and then she turned back and looked over and grinned at me.</p> <p>"What?" I said.</p> <p>"Nothing," she answered.</p> <p>"Nothing?" I said.</p> <p>"Don't know...just admiring you and your clothes and your legs and your hair," she said as she reached out and caressed my face, "I suppose that this is the most I've ever thought about you," she went on as she pulled my face even closer.</p> <p>"I'm just a pretty girl, aren't I?" she whispered with her eyes on mine.</p> <p>"Uh-huh...I think that," I murmured, "But you've been talking about some other men and things. I don't know how you got here...I mean it's just...I mean I feel bad about having this thing with my husband, but..."</p> <p>"Too late, honey," she sighed, "I'm all yours. I'm not the only one who enjoyed hearing about my husband. I was able to get to him, too, you know."</p> <p>"Do you really?"</p> <p>"Yah—I still remember the first time I heard you talk about him," she said and I shook my head.</p> <p>"Yeah, sometimes," I said. She seemed to be taking me in.</p> <p>"Maybe I should have listened. Do you still want to come back—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
