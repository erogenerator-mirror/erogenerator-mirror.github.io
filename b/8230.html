He smiled as he slipped his finger inside my hole to feel the little pain he had brought, so as not to cause much discomfort. I was still tight against his finger. He continued the finger in my ass, as if he had not found out which hole it was going in. As I began to loosen up, he pulled out just barely. His finger popped out of me and started the gentle rocking back and forth. I felt the warmth of it as I got used to it. Then without being commanded for his finger to, he pushed it right in. It was a soft humming feeling which felt different from my own. I loved that he just pushed his finger in and that I was now welcoming him.</p> <p>He picked up the pace of the pounding. I could feel his finger stretching me inside of me and felt it go in and out. He brought his head up and looked at me, smiled and said, "I am going to fuck your ass with my finger."</p> <p>Before I said yes or no, I am scared to say it. I mean I really loved the feeling of his finger in my ass. I felt it slip in a little and I wanted more. He slowly wiggled his finger inside of me again, a little faster this time. I reached down and caressed his balls which had a large, wrinkled cock hanging down from them.</p> <p>"I want to feel you in my mouth, " I said and he responded by pushing a little more with his finger. I knew there was no turning back on what we had just done. I would not have had the words, had I not agreed to this. What would have happened if he had turned me down? But he had not turned me on. In the moment, I had already said yes to this. But it seemed more a turn on having him in my mouth. What did he think would happen, was he turned it down and wanted to find out my desires in the same, strange way? I did not think so at the moment. I wanted him as much as he wanted me. For the first time in our married life, we were going to get our sexual needs met.</p> <p>I felt his finger going in and out in his hand again. It felt so exciting having him inside of me, inside of my bottom. He was now twisting his finger in and out in a way that took me over the edge. My hand was caressing his cock more vigorously than I had ever, felt it was hardening in my hand, and he began to hump his hard finger in and out faster.</p> <p>"Your ass is so tight is a good thing," he moaned. I was loving this as he was, but I had an alternative to say yes. Instead of saying no, I begged him to stop, I begged Him to fuck my ass hard and cum in my ass fast. He continued to hold my hands out by the wrist and just pulled it back as he shoved it hard and deep into me. It felt like his cock was going in me all the way up to his balls as he took my hand and squeezed it hard and very firmly in his hand. He began to fuck me harder and faster.</p> <p>I loved it. I loved the way he had controlled the pace and force of his ass fuck. I loved how far he had gone! But I found myself wanting more. I loved the fact that I actually could have stopped him, after I agreed to go through with it.</p> <p>"My cock feels so good," he said as he picked up the pace. His cock was moving in and out of my ass more freely now. I love the things he is able to do to me. As he was now pounding my ass, he pulled his finger out so his finger could rest right on my prostate. It felt so good as his finger gently rubbed me there. He pushed his finger in as far the back of him as it would go, I could feel his finger pressing inside of me. I loved it.</p> <p>"I am gonna cum in your mouth," he grunted. I looked up to see a smile appear on his face and knew he knew it was my turn to say yes. So I just did what he did, which is asked an open mouth, which I did and he did. I then tasted his warm cum in my mouth. I loved it. I loved it, I loved the taste of his cum. It was the very flavor of his cum and I think about as often as I can, of all of the things a husband does for his wife's benefit. I had a very sexual, excited, satisfied and sexual fantasy of having a lover's sperm in my mouth. It was not just the taste of his cum, but the essence of his essence which I found with him.</p> <p>As we both lay there recovering for a little while, he said, "I want to makeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
