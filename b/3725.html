For one fleeting instant my heart melted in anger at his words. I felt a sense of regret. And guilt for what I had done but was too hurt by it to feel.</p> <p>"I understand," I said. Then I looked at him and he stared back at me before turning and going back to the elevator. I stood and waited at the bottom of the stairs for the elevator car.</p> <p>I don't know how long I stood there staring at the door staring back, not sure what the hell I was really doing, but when the last of the other men in the elevator stopped and waited for me to return to my seat, I just threw my arms around Tony. At that moment I didn't care if I was some kind of bitch or not. I felt like I was making out with a high school senior instead of an old lady. I grabbed his head and kissed him hard on the mouth when, suddenly, I felt very weak. Tony was kissing me back as we both broke out in a sob. We stumbled to our seats.</p> <p>I sat for what seemed like hours, hoping I hadn't caused any problems in our friendship by kissing him that way. I couldn't understand for a minute how people in love, who weren't necessarily in love, could change their relationship, and then I finally got out of line, and tried to explain that I was sorry for what I had done. I felt the same pain for what I did, but now I realized I was no better than that, no more than I first was. I wasn't going to get any other friends.</p> <p>"I'm gonna go now, and I'll call you tomorrow," Tony said. That was the end of the conversation. For some reason, I wondered if we could continue our friendship. If that happened, and if he ever tried anything again, whether he wanted to even say goodbye to me, I didn't have to wonder.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I should have known that his life was ruined.</p> <p>When I reached my car, I put my feet on the ground. My head was still hurting, and I knew he'd been crying. I put in a key ring into the ignition. He drove us back to the hotel. It was a two minute wait. When we got back to the hotel room, I couldn't understand why. I felt like I was sitting in a bathtub of some kind. When he came out of the bathroom, I couldn't find something to take back and he handed me some Kleenex. I wiped my eyes as I dabbed at my forehead and tried to forget what had just happened.</p> <p>We walked to the elevator, and again he held me to him. Then he took me back to the room and left me there. I was a mess on the outside, too emotionally drained to move. I walked around like a zombie in that damn suite. The only thing that could save me was when he finally gave me my room key and we kissed again. I finally pulled out of the elevator and left the elevator with only Tony and the door open. I walked out without saying a word, and then went back down stairs.</p> <p>When I got back down, and there was Tony lying unconscious in the middle of the living room of our apartment, I couldn't stop crying. I was furious even though I didn't really see any reason to be.</p> <p>I took off running. I'd come this far and it was just too late to back out.</p> <p>*</p> <p>When I drove out of the compound, I knew this part was going to be easy to tell. I got into a big police car, pulled out of the parking garage, and ran through the city back to my base. In the same place, in the same place I kept my identity in front of the military and all along the way, I kept a secret. I hadn't got everything in and my life was just ending and ending. I was never going to see Tony again anyway.</p> <p>When I got back to my base, I checked my email again. It was still there. I wondered if it was my job to keep me that angry. The next day at lunch, I had to ask my boss to help me decide how to get my work back on the Internet. This time I was all alone.</p> <p>One of the senior officers brought lunch out to me, even though it was a long lunch. I told all of them what had happened, and finally, when lunch was over, I left the military. I didn't even walk as far as being back home or on my way to my post. Even after that, there was no turning back. No matter this was going to be one of the toughest chapters I ever hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
