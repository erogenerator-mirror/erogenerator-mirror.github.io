Her pussy felt warm and wet, and she felt her body shiver, not from the sensual feelings her eyes provided, but because he knew it was her.</p> <p>"God, I'd love to do that again!" she thought. "I'd love to make love to you like no tomorrow. God, I'd love for that to happen, to come home to me."</p> <p>She felt herself begin to slide down the bed, so she did not look at him, she put her hands to her face, trying to regain control of the impulse she had to look at him.</p> <p>"Oh, I love to kiss you," she said at last. "I think it's time I made that happen."</p> <p>"I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I'm trying to decide if I want to make it happen!"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, I want to make it happen, now," she said and pushed her body down onto the bed. "I mean, all of us could start with me making the arrangements, and then we could make the best of what we've got, and you could start things off." She felt her head hit the pillow again, and she lay there staring at the ceiling. "If you're doing this one thing, it might be better if we get naked together, and make this happen for real, and not just once."</p> <p>"Sure, I'm interested in having sex with you," he said.</p> <p>"Hm. What do you mean?"</p> <p>"You have to have sex with me," he said. "And in return, I get naked before you. You get your clothes off when we start going. And you can have sex with me, if you want to."</p> <p>"I like to have sex with you, and I like that about you."</p> <p>"Yes, I like what I like about you, even if it's just for you, and only for me."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, I can agree with that, even if it is only sex," she said, then got out of bed, removed her thong, and moved a few feet away from him. "I think it's time you started being naked around me." "I think we should start by undressing each other, before we start anything."</p> <p>"If you really want me to be naked around you, I want to see all of you every once and a while," she said, then turned and lay back on the bed, and held out the nightgown. She rolled on her back, and reached to her sides, and ran a finger along the bottom edge. "If it's okay with you, and I like it, then if you do feel that good, I'll let you in if you want to. Now, what do you want? I'm sure you're already a fan of that."</p> <p>"You didn't say that you like to be naked around me. How do you mean?"</p> <p>"I just don't want you to be disappointed," she sighed. "I like you naked, of course, so I thought you might like this."</p> <p>"It's not that, is it?" he said, a little surprised. He was very surprised, to know she loved the idea of being with him naked, and of being naked around her.</p> <p>"Nope," she said, "and I'm not disappointed at all. For you, it's been nice to have me around for a long time. I hope to make it as nice for you as it's for me." Then, she took the nightgown over her head, and looked up at him. "You've really made me feel great," she added, sitting up on the edge of the bed to remove her bra and undies.</p> <p>"So have I. I've always wanted to do this with you, so if that's okay with you, then I'll love to make love to you." He took the nightgown gently off her and she lay back, then held out the nightgown to him. "Here it is," he said and slipped it over her head.</p> <p>"Mmm." She let it slide over her naked body and felt it move down her arms and finally down a little to rest on her hips. She lay there with her legs closed, looking at him as he slowly undressed and removed his pants and the boxers he had been wearing. "God," she thought, "I am doing this!" and she lifted her feet to let them slide from around her legs, then let them slide down off her feet and into his arms.</p> <p>"God," he said after a momentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
