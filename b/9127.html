I took off my skirt and lay on the sofa with my back to the wall. I pulled the top of my dress down and spread myself open to her view.</p> <p>We were lying on the sofa and I put her skirt back on and we were just chatting – talking about the film, her family and friends, our lives, the weather, the weather…</p> <p>“You know how wet you have made me now?” she asked. “Oh, yes.” I responded. I felt I could say “yes” and be in no doubt what I had been doing.</p> <p>“I don’t feel so good,” she stated, her face serious.</p> <p>“What is the matter? You are too tense now,” I offered. “It is all right.”</p> <p>“No, it isn’t,” she muttered. “It is just,” she paused to collect herself and then added, “It’s the heat and all the tension. I feel too much.”</p> <p>I rolled on top of her, my hand stroking her leg. “Let’s get you calmed down,” I suggested.</p> <p>We had been lying around a bit when we felt a hand touch us each. I didn’t move, but just closed my eyes, listening to the sound of the hand. My breath came in short sharp breaths as the hand went through my short hair, down the front of my dress, between my legs and gently between my thighs. “Oh, yes,” I sighed. “This feels nice.”</p> <p>After a couple of minutes it got better. Just a minute of it, and then the hand was on my breast. I was already aroused, but it was a little more exciting. I opened my eyes to see if anyone had noticed.</p> <p>My eyes were closed but I could feel hands gently caressing my body and the hands between my legs. The caresses went up and down the front of my skin, and then one hand began tracing the outline of my lips, gently stroking my clitorises.</p> <p>I couldn’t stand the sensation and my hand found myself stroking the hand, feeling the hand moving against me, feeling the hand slipping across my clitoris.</p> <p>I gasped my breath, I felt my breasts heave.</p> <p>“Does it hurt?”</p> <p>My mouth was open but no sound came out, just the breathing, the gentle stroking of the hand, in a moment or two I felt orgasmic wave overtake me. I jerked and arched backwards, my hand went limp below the surface and I could feel the orgasm continuing.</p> <p>As it came slowly to an end my hand started to slip down towards my breasts, touching my nipples, running between my legs, feeling the hand on my vagina.</p> <p>My breathing was increasing and I could feel my heart going against my ribs, my stomach muscles clenching. The hand went, with a gentle pressure across the clitoris, which was now erect once again, as it continued to stroke.</p> <p>I was aware that I was shaking slightly, and the hand between my legs seemed to be getting a little rough. She was doing that now, a bit faster. It felt nice. My hand, which had been cupping my breasts, now gripped the hard length of the penis, which was pressing into my leg. It was hard. It was as if a man was pressing against me, but I could feel it moving in my hand. I felt a tingle of pleasure and thought I saw a cock in my hand, but the face wasn't the man.</p> <p>“This is nice,” I murmured. “I liked the feel of your hand, but I liked your touch.”</p> <p>“I know,” he replied. “It was more of another male, and it felt good and I liked it.”</p> <p>I smiled at him. “It feels like you had something between your legs now I heard you. Just let go. I enjoyed that.”</p> <p>I saw his hand move once more. It must have taken him a second to make his hand, which, as I had expected had started to move up a gear. I had to concentrate. With my free hand I stroked the penis, but I couldn’t keep my thumb on it, it was too sensitive. I stopped for a minute.</p> <p>“You are so beautiful. You have very pretty breasts. You are very attractive. I thought you were gorgeous.”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
