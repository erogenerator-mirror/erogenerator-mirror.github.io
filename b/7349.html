How long has that been going on, you know? I don't know, how long has it been going on for? How come I've only known that for about 10 hours?"</p> <p>"Oh," she said, her eyes going as deep as they could. "I...I dunno...oh God! Oh God!"</p> <p>Margo felt herself melting as his hands came up and slid over the back of her bra, brushing over and into her bra cup as her other hand sought to keep her breasts from getting crushed again.</p> <p>He could feel her trembling for a moment, and then she leaned closer, pushing her chest towards him and reaching between them with both hands. His hands came up to capture her bra strap and quickly release it to fall slack off the end of her breast before pulling it down off her body once more.</p> <p>"No," he said, pressing her to her back while his hands traveled slowly down her sides, sliding over the curve of her breasts before gliding slowly over the mounds of flesh they contained.</p> <p>His fingers lightly squeezed her nipples through the cotton of her shirt, pinching lightly between each hand in turn. As he felt her shiver for a moment, feeling as if the chill of that first touch made her whole body go hot again, he saw with a brief flash of pain in her eyes that she was still resisting him.</p> <p>"I have to leave," he said once again, his own hands coming up her sides again and moving slowly upwards to cup and gently hold her breasts, the feel of flesh in his hands sent a shiver of pleasure coursing through her. When he found her nipples, he just held them, squeezing and gently rolling them between his fingers, feeling their size and firm shape, the nipples as stiff as rocks.</p> <p>Margo was still looking at the clock, counting.</p> <p>"And no," she said simply, "I am going to miss you."</p> <p>Margo waited until they were out of the water again, before he had the chance to push her into the hot tub.</p> <p>There was no rush, just a long, slow, lingering rub, so they climbed up into the tub together and slid in, their feet just touching, a little farther and farther down.</p> <p>Margo felt him lean back, his arms on either side of her body as he settled himself. They felt his own chest just below hers as his hands moved slowly over her arms, her nipples brushing against his. She could feel his cock pressing against her as he pushed his cock into her, feeling his legs move out from between hers as he pushed himself in deeper.</p> <p>"I need to hold out just a bit longer," he said, "I want this to be special for you."</p> <p>"Just give it a rest, okay?" she said, leaning closer against him where his hands were rubbing up and down her arms.</p> <p>He turned his body slowly, pulling her with him as they moved, the kiss going from a lingering to a long and deep one. His left hand stayed firm on her shoulder, his hand moving down over her shoulder to cup and gently squeeze her left breast, his right hand slipping off her right tit, squeezing and pinching her nipple between his fingers.</p> <p>Margo felt the wetness of his mouth on her neck, his tongue pushing deeply into her as he kissed her. Their kiss was long and passionate, both of them feeling the pleasure of the other's body.</p> <p>She felt his left hand moving down her stomach, to cup the mound of her pussy briefly before she felt his fingers start to rub up and down her slit, spreading the slick wetness there and pushing a finger up into the hole she had in front, moving it around for a moment to try and find the tiny little button that he had found the one time only.</p> <p>"I'm going to go a bit faster in there," he said, his voice a husky, raspy whisper. "Let me feel you."</p> <p>"Mmm, you have a way of making me feel better than I'm feeling right now!" she said. "And I want to feel that cock pumping in and out of me! I want you to fill my pussy with everything you've got."</p> <p>Her words felt really good to him, as he kissed her hard, his hand moving more rapidly now into her pussy. His finger moved to her clit, pushing her back down onto the seat of the tub as she felt herself being lifted in the air, a leg wrapping around him as her clit was pushed into his groin, her whole body starting to shudder as she let out a deep moan, her head dropping back and her eyes tightly shut as she felt her pussy clench as though trying to swallow her up.</p> <p>"Yessssss," she hissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
