He says simply and walks away from me.</p> <p>"Why are you here? I thought you were looking for an apprentice?" He says as he walks out of my room.</p> <p>I sit up in the bed and stare down at the ceiling.</p> <p>"I am here because I love you." Is all I hear before a knock on the door!</p> <p>I look up in surprise, but it doesn't matter. I don't know who it was, it just happened...it's not important. I just know that I am at a point where I am not going to allow him or anyone else into my room.</p> <p>"Come on, take a look at the place. I'll be with you in a moment."</p> <p>I smile, get out of the bed and go up stairs. There is only my dresser which I pull up against the wall, I toss on the dresser and come back down to the living room which is empty.</p> <p>I pull the door open and look around trying to figure out where he left off.</p> <p>"I don't know what I'm doing here." I am confused.</p> <p>"You could have brought me over to your room. I'm going to change and let you get changed."</p> <p>I sit down on the couch and watch the TV for a bit to think about what he just told me.</p> <p>"What are we going to do? I'm trying to make up the difference between my new life with you and my new life with him. I'm so confused that I don't know if I have a choice." I am just starting to cry now.</p> <p>"I'm not sure what I am going to do, I'll just take a chance but I don't think we need to talk. We do need to keep it our business."</p> <p>"He makes it sound like a business." I say as I go to sit down in front of the couch again.</p> <p>"What do you think? I have been looking for people like you for a long time and none of them have come here." He says as he gets closer.</p> <p>I close my eyes in surprise.</p> <p>"I just came here because I loved you."</p> <p>He lets his hands rest on the couch next to me and he leans towards me to kiss me. I turn around to look at him.</p> <p>"It's too soon isn't it?" I smile.</p> <p>"It's been so long with him." I say and kiss his lips.</p> <p>I turn and walk towards the kitchen, he follows close behind me. I grab a bunch of food off the counter and start digging into my meal while he watches.</p> <p>"If I had said I wanted to die, then he could have been in his old age." I say while looking down at myself and getting angry. "You must have some issues with him."</p> <p>"We have our business but he doesn't have my business." I say while pulling an old-fashioned fork out of the drawer and making a salad out of it.</p> <p>"That is a shame." His eyes grow wide.</p> <p>"You are the only one that knows!"</p> <p>"We have a business here." He says while starting to pull out my chair. "Sit on mine."</p> <p>"Thank you." I say as I sit down between his legs.</p> <p>"No, this is for him not you." His smile is wide as he walks by my chair and sits down in it.</p> <p>"I thought we had it all figured out." I start to sit up but he quickly moves closer to me.</p> <p>"What is wrong with you?" I whisper.</p> <p>"Nothing. I only have this one thing on my mind...what are we going to do?" I sit up in surprise.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel like you have to be alone in your life."</p> <p>I lean over the edge of the chair to meet him.</p> <p>"I would just hate to leave you in that position." I say while running my fingers through his hair and running my fingers in small circles over his forehead.</p> <p>"It's okay. You're not hurting anyone. It's just that your not there anymore and I don't want to force you to do anything. It's just that you've made this much more complicated than I expected." He says staring into my eyes with a look that melts me.</p> <p>"I'm going to have to think about that for a while," I say as I lean my head over his shoulder and put my lips over his neck.</p> <p>"I'll think about it."</p> <p>"I love you." Is all I say with the last word.</p> <p>My mouth moves down his neck where my lips brush over his skin and he doesn't even flinch.</p> <p>"I love you and want you to feel theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
