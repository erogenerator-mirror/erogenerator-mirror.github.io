They would not have been able to finish the job. "Okay, Mr. Harsone" she cried, "I think I want to go back to the party."</p> <p>"Don't you dare" I replied, holding her tightly, "I can't. It's not right."</p> <p>"Yes it is," she said. If I don't give her the final score, I'll never have another chance.</p> <p>"But, then," I said, "we would just have to go back." I couldn't tell her what my final score would be or where we were going. Besides, where had the key to being a good friend to a lovely girl like her?</p> <p>She continued to be obstinate about not being allowed back to the party. It was hard enough having to get her dress back, then finding out they had a naked orgy after this was over...</p> <p>I didn't get that right...</p> <p>"Fine," I muttered, "You're going." I then turned her around and bent her over, my still mostly hard cock at full mast. Her ass was nicely curved and just as I like to see it. "I'll wait a couple of hours then go back."</p> <p>"How do you have your hands on this young lady again?" she asked in a playful manner.</p> <p>"Oh, that depends," I replied.</p> <p>"I don't know," she said.</p> <p>"I know," I replied. "But if you don't wait a minute, I'll be back."</p> <p>She gave me a coy smile and turned back to the others.</p> <p>I made sure the car was the last one to leave the parking lot before it was on its way back to our home. By then I could have made a good deal of a mess myself. I pulled my erection down from between my thighs and left it on its way from her rear end. It always seemed so out of character to have someone watch me like an audience in a porno. I don't know if it would do her any good to continue to have sex with one or more of her boyfriends.</p> <p>It certainly didn't help my state of mind that I ended up in a similar predicament when I had my first experience with a young woman. I was not very successful at hiding how deeply I was in love with her... and I did not even have to worry about her having a chance once she started going up against my legs. She was an extremely sexy young woman. She was also a very skilled woman.</p> <p>As I started back to our home I could not help but wonder if it was just a one-time thing, but then I was getting a bit worried again. I was certainly not going to be able to keep the promise I had made to her when I was with her. I might even say I was worried about what might happen if she did become sexually interested in other guys.</p> <p>My concerns were dashed in the most surprising of ways when I heard a loud and very loud bang on our front door. I knew we had only half an hour and I was wondering if it was the sound of my door... or the loud bang on our front door that kept me awake this whole morning. The mystery grew. I was not expecting the sound of the door to open this early... I mean, how could I have been so certain... but that thought seemed ridiculous to me in the heat of excitement. I wasn't at all sure that I could have kept it down this early. We were never allowed to open the door, not even the night of our first weekend together.</p> <p>At first they were just a couple of feet away when they happened. I was almost sure if someone happened to see us together the next time we were together, they would see us as something that needed to happen at some point. But what is even more, what followed is something that I still can't even fathom... but what does it mean? Is there something about seeing two guys naked right next to each other that is enough to make it happen?</p> <p>We had lived in New Jersey for less than a year and had both lived there for as many months. I did not know exactly what it was when we arrived. I knew it was a sign that was impossible for me not to have my head on a fence post. I am sure you could say that when I wasn't busy doing the usual things that a kid would normally do when he gets high and running, but I never thought that maybe I was out to break the old fashion rules. Maybe the reality of what I was doing was worse than I feared.</p> <p>While I couldn't even remember precisely what I was doing, I could just kind of make out the words of their voices in my head. I even remembered hearing the voice of the boy I had helped when I was helping out inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
