He called a few times and left a message when he got home. He kept calling even though he didn't know what to do next. She was no longer the young woman he remembered. Her beauty now she stood 5'4" with long strawberry blonde hair that was worn down almost to her waist. Her full breasts were covered with a deep cleavage that her shirt left open. Her hips curved and flared out to a beautiful curve that just barely covered what would be a firm ass when she wore jeans. She still looked pretty good in the worst way.</p> <p>He got himself together and left for his house. He thought about spending the whole night with her but couldn't find the energy to do that. He got home and went through the house looking for the housekeeper. When he found her cleaning in the kitchen with two plates of hot dog food in her hands he knew it had to be her. It was the first Monday in April he had spent any more time in that school and so he decided to just sit in the kitchen until the food got cold.</p> <p>He cleaned off the dishes and took the plates into the kitchen to cook. It didn't take him long before he realized he couldn't cook. He couldn't eat as much as he used to so he was glad he had put together enough food and clean his house as quickly as possible. He didn't want to eat again. Finally he just walked to his room and pulled on some clothes when he walked out the door.</p> <p>He walked into the house to get something to eat and a glass of water. He saw his parents lounging on the couch and realized he could make a little noise as he walked down the hall towards them. He went and sat down and looked at his parents. There was no anger in his voice now. They just talked and talked as they both seemed to be in a good mood.</p> <p>He looked over to his mom and dad and noticed he was looking at Karen. He looked at Karen and didn't realize she looked like she had been crying this morning. He quickly asked where the dishes were but noticed he was only talking to her.</p> <p>"I didn't know where you had gone to help them," Karen said. In response he said, "Yeah, they were getting into bed and I told them I would take care of them if I could have help them. I was going to just sit and talk but I didn't know where to go. I guess you and I could just talk like we used to. Karen just looked at him and said, "No, don't do that, its ok. Karen is going to be ok. I promise no one ever saw us again. You always thought I was your ex but it was all lies. I just couldn't stand you because you wouldn't let me be a part of your life. Do you know what I didn't have until I got over that? I had to make a decision. I couldn't say it any other way."</p> <p>Karen looked confused so Mark looked at her and said, "I remember you telling me that was your decision. I can't say no either. You have to go and have fun but only if you have a plan that can make you happy. I can't say it."</p> <p>Karen got up and went over to her desk and flipped open a drawer that was full of her toys. She pulled out a small vibrator and handed it to him. "I've never used one of these in front of a boy but I'm sure they are ready to use on you." Karen said while looking at the toys. "There will be a couple for each of us, right?"</p> <p>"Right," he said, "I'm going to take this one now."</p> <p>Karen got a small leather harness and put it on while he got a small dildo and lube from one of the cabinets. He asked her if he could use one of the toys on Karen. His answer was short though because she took it from his hand and pulled on it. "No, I don't like anal so it's easier with a little lubrication." She then pulled back on the harness and put a bottle of lube on his cock.</p> <p>Mark watched as she put some on his face and then she put some on herself so he did the same. She pulled the harness up over his cock making it look like a cock and said, "OK my little sweet boy, here come the lube." She then had him lie on the couch on his back. "Now let's just play and let me do everything." She got a bottle of oil from a box in the corner of the room and got a bottle from where she was sitting with her legs spread under her. She put a large dollop of the stuff on his asshole and watched as it slowly ran down toward his balls.
