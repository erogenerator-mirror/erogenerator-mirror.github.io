I'd had her in my apartment for the previous three weeks. It had been a long, busy, but not unpleasant day. I had invited her back to my place after that night in my apartment with me. I'd watched her get naked as we went into my living room to watch the movie. I had been in the process of getting a drink. When it was over her naked body had quickly joined mine on the couch.</p> <p>I had started to do the same thing to her as the night before. Each time, I'd move into her body as well. One time I'd even slid my dick up and down her ass as I was getting ready to go to bed. She had been on the couch with me, one arm around her leg. After having the third time with her, I'd gone to bed with her and woke up to her kissing me, rubbing her body up under my covers as she rubbed her clit against mine. She'd been sucking my cock, licking and biting on my lips as we continued to kiss. I had been rubbing my dick in and out of her, and she had been taking my dick in her throat.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The day before her trip to the airport, I stopped by her apartment for dinner on the way, saying I'd been out to a friend's. She showed me inside, and I saw what she was wearing: a short dress that was covered with a dark blue garter belt and matching French knickers. What she wearing inside was the same style she'd had on the night before. Her breasts weren't large; she only had a 34B cup. I could see a pair of dark pink areolas through the fabric of her bra. She had on a pair of white stockings, which were on her legs for support.</p> <p>As we ate each other's food and wine, the conversation drifted. She asked me about the last few days. I said that I'd had a lot to drink and was surprised by her openness. She said she had also had a lot to drink that night, and that she also had a number of different men at her house.</p> <p>"How would you feel about that, Lynn?"</p> <p>She looked over at me, "Well, it isn't my husband you're talking to."</p> <p>I looked at her and replied, "He really cares about me, and I care for him, but what you're asking me is about how you feel about your marriage and having the two of you in each other's arms, not just one husband and three."</p> <p>She looked at me as if to ask what I was saying. I told her about how much I loved her and that I loved both of us and just wanted to do whatever I could to make us happy.</p> <p>When we finished eating that night, I said, "Lynn, I love you more that I've ever wanted to admit it." I meant what I said and how my voice expressed my feelings.</p> <p>I kissed her and said, "I love you too."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>* *</p> <p>Part 1</p> <p>* *</p> <p>My phone rang as I was driving across town and I answered the phone. This time, I was talking to a man on the other end, and after we'd talked for a few moments, he gave me a small smile and said, "Hi. This is Michael. What's up?"</p> <p>"Do you have any tickets for the weekend?" I asked, figuring that his flight was booked up this weekend, and had something for him to do.</p> <p>"No. I'm staying at my folks' over in New Orleans."</p> <p>"Oh. What are you doing there, then?"</p> <p>"My folks are gone. It just seems so weird to think about. What kind of guy flies in his own plane and has my wife stay at his folks' and be with three other guys."</p> <p>"Wow. Seems crazy. Are you and this guy friends? That sounds intriguing."</p> <p>"I go back home and he spends most of his time at his folks. We do business together, too."</p> <p>"I see. Well, good. If it's about you, you really want to go to New Orleans and be our buddy, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah. If it's about my marriage and about you, I guess it makes sense."</p> <p>When he hesitated a little, I put myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
