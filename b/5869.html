Her pussy was so hot and wet and just so swollen—her lips stretched and opened like a flower's petals.</p> <p>"Lick it," she ordered. "Lick my pussy...oh, fuck, that feels soooo good."</p> <p>I pushed my tongue as deep as I could—the flat of it pressed against the roof of my mouth, and as I pushed forward it came to rest flat. I pushed again and watched as she rolled her hips back and forth, moaning and making noises that were impossible to control even with my nose so far inside of her. She was on fire and I hoped she wouldn't mind my tongue in her pussy, even if I ate her out all evening.</p> <p>"That's it, lick that pussy," she instructed. She moved her hands down into her ass and began to push against my tongue, making her slick. I began to slide it in and out while my fingers explored her wetness.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels so good, Jonnie...like I said I always do. Don't stop, baby, keep going."</p> <p>Lips closed around the base of my shaft as I continued to move my tongue in and out of her. She moaned louder and louder as she pushed hard against my face, grinding her pussy against my mouth and nose.</p> <p>Her body tensed and then relaxed as she opened her eyes and met my eyes with a glazed look. Then she looked back at me. "I said I do, Jonnie; tell me you like it," she said as she reached down to grasp my cock in one hand. "Tell me the right way, Jonnie."</p> <p>I looked up at her, not sure what she wanted to hear.</p> <p>"I'm a naughty girl, Jonnie. Tell me what you like," she said as she put a hand on her hip, then pulled me toward her so I was now buried deep inside her.</p> <p>"I like your...your..." I stopped talking. She smiled and nodded as I felt her pussy tighten, sucking my tongue in deeper. I continued to suck her clitoris between my lips as her body started to twitch, her breathing becoming ragged.</p> <p>"Ahhhhh!" she groaned, then released my head as she came, her pussy juice flowing down my face as she rode my mouth.</p> <p>My head remained resting on her stomach as she caught her breath. Her body relaxed and she turned back toward me, sitting straight up as she looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"That was unbelievable," she said, almost shyly. "I love it!"</p> <p>"It's your turn to do it now," I chuckled.</p> <p>I looked at her and she grinned, then sat up, her naked body against mine, her small breasts pressing into me. Looking at me, her hand reached out to stroke my cock.</p> <p>"Come on, Jonnie, we need to eat something first," she said with a wicked grin. "Do you mind if I show you the rest of the house?"</p> <p>I reached out to hand her her keys but she stopped me.</p> <p>"I got something I want to do first," she smiled and took me by the hand. "Follow me, sweetie, I'll catch you."</p> <p>She led me up the stairs to a little room. The top of it held a queen-size bed of red and black velvet, with a large, red and blue checra bedspread. As I reached out to place my hand on the bedspread, the door opened and in walked Lacey, wearing a dark green dress that showed off her long legs, which led upstairs to the bathroom.</p> <p>"Do you like these?" she asked me as she moved toward me, her arm around my neck and her body against mine. Her hands were on my neck, her legs spreading. She closed the door and pulled me toward her and I put my arms on her buttocks. It made her feel naked, and her lips moved to my ear and her breath was hot.</p> <p>"Oh, Jonnie, fuck, you're so sexy," said Lacey as she moved back, straddling me. Her hands slipped off my shoulders and down my arms, then began to rub all over me, slowly massaging my chest and stomach as her lips moved over mine.</p> <p>"Do you mind if we do those buttons now?" she asked before lowering her mouth onto mine. Her breasts brushed my chest as she pressed into me. Slowly she moved down my body, her eyes watching the movements of my body as they moved across my bare skin. Kissing me she began to undo each button. I gasped as her hand slipped down my chest and under my shorts until it rested on my cock.</p> <p>"Please, Jonnie—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
