I need to find out why you are in such a state? I asked.</p> <p>"I'm having trouble getting my life-glasses on. Maybe you can help. You seem so busy. I might give you a piece of my mind if you were the kind of person to leave with something bothering your life."</p> <p>I sighed and rubbed my hands together. I don't understand why I need this vacation, but it is the start of something that will soon end. "I can't just stay here. I have too much work on right now." This is going to be hard, I think.</p> <p>"You know I can help," he said with a knowing look. He sounded so much more comfortable than I was.</p> <p>"I don't know why I want to go back to my life. This vacation just isn't me."</p> <p>"It wasn't meant to be. I would never leave you," he said in a small voice. He turned and turned on a lamp next to the bed where he had laid down.</p> <p>I sat up in bed and looked around the room. He stood by the bed and watched me. I looked toward the closet where he stood hidden. I went over to the closet and looked around. There were stacks of suitcases in it I had to pick them up. As I looked over my head, I realized I might be looking at his body. It seemed more important that I look at his face than his body.</p> <p>"Oh, sorry. Nothing's wrong. I was just looking at your body. It is so nice," I said shyly.</p> <p>"Yeah, nice. I'm sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have said the one about him," he said as he picked up several more suitcases. "So, why are you in such a rush to get away? I can't stay here. You are too important to me right now."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know. I can't leave right now. I don't need this vacation. I've been here for so long, but I need to come back to life. I can't just come back to it."</p> <p>"Oh but you do need it. It's not like I want to leave you with anything that's troubling your personal life right now," he said as he pulled me over to him and hugged me to him. "I miss you."</p> <p>"Me too," I said, as I felt an electricity of friendship radiate from his body. "Thank you for saving my life."</p> <p>*</p> <p>I was sitting in my cell that night when I had the most incredible dream. There was a big ball in front of me in the cell. There in front of me was myself. I knew it was me. I looked at the ball. It was my heart. I was all my own.</p> <p>The ball I was in now had no significance to me at all. There would be no hearts in me.</p> <p>*</p> <p>It was a day after my day of therapy when I was awakened by my husband's voice.</p> <p>"Do you remember my dream?" I asked. I wasn't sure what he was doing. I sat up and stretched out. My body began to move in my sleep. I couldn't believe it. He sat next to me, in the same spot that I was. It just felt so right.</p> <p>"Yes, I do," I said as my husband's face came into view. My body started to move again. He wasn't in the spoon position. I felt an ache in my pussy. I thought I had had sex before, and I knew what it meant that time had not been very memorable.</p> <p>"I want to hear you say it," he said as he pulled me into his arms. I wrapped my legs around him and started to move on his belly. We looked at each other and smiled.</p> <p>"It was you," I said with my heart all over again. "You saved my life."</p> <p>"I think I know what your saying," he said with a laugh. He had an ear to ear grin on his face.</p> <p>"I love you now."</p> <p>"And if I didn't have these dreams right now, I'd be back on my knee."</p> <p>"I guess so," was all he said for a second. I closed my eyes and smiled.</p> <p>I felt my husband's body rising and falling on mine. I could feel the bulge in his pants pressing into my pubic hair and even though there was no penis present on us, I knew the moment would never end.</p> <p>A wave of guilt washed over me.
