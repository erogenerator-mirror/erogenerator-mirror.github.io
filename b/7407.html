I'd like to kiss you before we leave. I hope you don't mind."</p> <p>"I wouldn't mind, I want to kiss you." I took a deep breath and kissed him, feeling more than thinking; his kiss was like kissing a woman in love.</p> <p>I put my arms around his neck and he held me and put my arms around his neck and started kissing me all over his face I could do was keep kissing him it was a deep feeling of love for a man in my arms I felt like I'd never felt before.</p> <p>I'm not sure why; he put his hands under my arrivals which sent me into a state. I wrapped my legs around his waist and he lifted me on the chair. I thought that this might break the spell, but it didn't and I was feeling so loved and relaxed and I felt so desired. He picked me up and carried me into the bedroom and set me down in the middle of the bed. I wanted him to kiss me and I was surprised at all I wanted. I opened my legs just slightly and he lifted them just enough. I let out a soft moan but he had my panties around my ankles and he didn't rip them off. I lifted more and he held them at my pussy. I was so wet. He held my feet and lifted them over his shoulders and put the panties over my ankles.</p> <p>I lifted my arms over his shoulders and he pushed me down. I didn't care what he was. I closed my eyes and I really didn't care. He went straight for my pussy. I was on fire I almost came. He was right on the tip of my tongue, I took his face in my hands and licked him there and then licked the end of his little penis.</p> <p>The taste of myself was mixed with his wonderful juices. I went back to being his first and it turned me on so much that when he was done with my pussy he took my feet up over his shoulders with his hands and held my legs and looked at my pussy as he licked me. I was so lost that I knew that if he went on for a minute and I came and didn't want it to happen I would have orgasms I never felt before as I looked at him; eyes wide open and waiting. I was ready for him; wanting and yearning to feel him in me. I was afraid that this night would end in fireworks but no less turned on I was. Finally he did make love to me like he always did, but that night I wanted him to take me away from him again and again and again. When he came in me he fucked me so hard I couldn't concentrate on what they just talked about. He just gave me it and when he was done I came on him in a fury. I don't think I came that long or that I ever had before. He didn't seem to mind and he never stopped licking me. He made me cum over and over again. Finally he said that it was time to go. We said goodbye and we kissed, he held me and I felt as if my body was still with him. I was exhausted and he just put me down on the bed.</p> <p>"I have to go now. I need to know if I can tell you again who I'm looking for or what I'm looking for."</p> <p>"I'm not asking for anything."</p> <p>"Will you tell me?"</p> <p>"I really do need to tell someone."</p> <p>"I'll hold you to that."</p> <p>The next couple of weeks were as hot as I could ever remember going with a man and I had never had any sex. I was nervous but I was so turned on. I had a few other things on my mind as to what I was looking for but I wanted one more thing to come. I had my own ideas. The things we talked about the other night did me and I wanted his cock in me. That made this week as exciting and special as I ever imagined. He had done so much for me in both the business and lovemaking. He took me like crazy as I was just not ready for it. The sex was wild and intense. We were in the same place at the same time, in that one place we didn't have any secrets. We never talked about what we did when we were making love. He took me to a new level and he was not going to push it. He was going to make me feel really good and to love me. He was going to make me cum again and again, maybe on his cock. We made love every day, sometimes he would fuck me at night but he wouldn't go down or he never wanted to take his cock out. It always lasted a little less than three days, I think it got toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
