This is how I feel, for now. For the second time today, I'm going to do what I wanted—that's all it'll ever be. It'll be like I was made for it: I'm going to be used like a cheap whore, and I'm going to lose it without my family, my friends and my home life. In fact, I'm going to need it, whether I like it or not.</p> <p>Don't you want to fuck me, too? Well get over your inhibitions; I need it. I'm your bitch, and you need to have me.</p> <p>I'll fuck you...</p> <p>I can read your mind, too. The tone of your voice says it all, but words are a poor substitute for experience. We're on the right track now.</p> <p>Yes, I want it. I can't wait, but I want you to fuck me. I can't think if we'll stop. We've only just met and I want to have something new.</p> <p>Then you can make me beg for it, if you want, that is.</p> <p>No! That'd be too harsh, I think you want me to beg, but you're not going to make me beg—are you? Well, if it won't make you regret the night you went to bed alone. You'll want me to beg. But, maybe we'll both agree we're going to take it slow.</p> <p>I want to fuck you. I want to make you feel good.</p> <p>Do what it takes to make my fantasies come true. Please.</p> <p>I have no choice. I'll do what you want if for no other reason then I can get it. I'm doing this to please you—in a way you didn't want to do, but something you didn't even want to admit to.</p> <p>I think I might be able to get it out of you, in one of our sessions together. Maybe you'll have sex with me, because it'll make it better and because you'll want it. That should make your fantasies come true. I could do that if you want, but this isn't the time.</p> <p>We're going to do it in the bedroom—right now.</p> <p>Yes, you're right. So now what? What are you waiting for? Get on your knees.</p> <p>Get on your knees, I want to see that pretty face.</p> <p>Okay.</p> <p>I'll fuck you, but your face, not the pussy. Then get on your knees before I do it to you.</p> <p>We have a deal. I'll do what you want, when you want. If you get me off, I'll get you off.</p> <p>This isn't just about us having sex. You need to realize that.</p> <p>I understand my limitations. It's your choice. You'll live with me after that. You can be a total slut and have someone I'll fuck whenever you want. Just remember—no cheating, just fucking.</p> <p>The choice makes no difference to you.</p> <p>If it makes you feel good, I understand.</p> <p>Okay, just hold onto the line for a while. We'll get into more of the same in terms of what we'll do to each other. Just hold on to the line.</p> <p>Don't forget to take your panties off and rub myself to satisfaction.</p> <p>There it is. We have a deal. You'll know when you're ready to commit—and you will, once I put you through the paces.</p> <p>--*--</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>I can't get this fucking straight, but I have to.</p> <p>I've been thinking about this for a half-hour as I lay on the bed in my bed at home. In that way, I've put my life in danger, yet also saved my marriage. The way I see it—this isn't the place to start having your fantasies about me. If for no other reason than my desire to continue living the fantasy, then what's left to do is take a break. The alternative is to let these feelings die, that's what matters.</p> <p>We're supposed to have an agreement. Of course we do, but it means some things first.</p> <p>Let's say I've been playing around. Now how about that? I have a proposition for you—I can't just make it right as that.</p> <p>"You don't need to go into that part, baby. I'm sure you'll agree."</p> <p>I'm trying to be serious. You can get me over this. I have no choice. I do, however, want to get it out of my system. It should involve me, not you.</p> <p>"Do you have to?"</p> <p>"Yeah. That part of our relationship is something to have a discussion about.
