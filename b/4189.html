"She does it to me as much as she likes it when it's done to us."</p> <p>I couldn't disagree with that. He's one of the kindest guys I think I've ever met. He wasn't a bad man and wouldn't do anything against all my expectations. He was a good guy who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done. He and I have talked about stuff like that before and I knew the right guy to bring it up with.</p> <p>If it came to his face I would take him up on that one. He's so cool and caring that I want to do anything I can to help him. He's still a little shy to be taking advantage and making decisions on his own. It's not like we're in a race to win. I'm the driver and he's the passenger to my side. I'm the one in control so far. I know in my bones that no one has ever done anything like that before. If anyone did I've never gotten along with. No one has even touched me since the wedding when I was a baby.</p> <p>"Hey! Slow down!" He yelled out but in my mind when he finished speaking he was on a rollercoaster again. I could see his eyes clouding over and I almost laughed on that one.</p> <p>I moved his hand to me.</p> <p>"You ready to get going?" I whispered, smiling.</p> <p>We made it to the restaurant. The food wasn't what it should have been like when we went to bed but the food was fine. We paid the check to the waiter and I took my time to get to know him. We just enjoyed the food and talk. He looked to be about 25 years old and he looked really young at the same time. He had the look of someone you've just had a pretty good time at. I wasn't in a jealous mood but I was excited and a little surprised when he asked whether we wanted to walk over for a ride. Instead of doing a couple of miles I lead him out of the parking lot and into his car.</p> <p>He got in and we drove back to our place.</p> <p>"Where are we going for dinner?" He asked.</p> <p>"We want to watch a movie; we have a few that are going to be nice."</p> <p>"I want to go back to the room, if that's ok with you,"</p> <p>"Yeah it's fine with me! Are you sure no one is going to see us?"</p> <p>I was glad to have an excuse to pull away from the curb and go back in for a minute so that he could see if anyone else was following them.</p> <p>We got out of the parking lot and made our way upstairs to his room. I stopped him from pushing through the door.</p> <p>"It's ok, I'm not going to put anything on."</p> <p>"You can wear what we're wearing but you don't need anything either."</p> <p>He followed me into my room and we sat down on the bed. I unbuttoned my blouse and sat it down beside me. I took my time and pulled off my skirt and let it go. I sat on the bed next to him and he stood up and peeled off his shirt.</p> <p>"Hey look, I told you this was going to be fun."</p> <p>I nodded my head and watched him take off his pants. He pulled one of my panties out of it's package and he reached in and got his hand inside my panties. He started rubbing it around inside me. The room filled with the wet sounds of his fingers moving together inside me.</p> <p>"You ok with this?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I can't wait to see it and then watch us."</p> <p>He smiled and pulled my panties to the side and slid his cock inside my wet pussy. He moved very slightly and I pushed up to him. It slipped past my lips and just pushed against my womb. He continued to move it back and forth as he was getting into it. When he got to my pussy the head went in and it slipped on the outside of my pussy.</p> <p>"Mmm, that's nice." He said. He looked down at my face.</p> <p>"Didi you're sopping. Didi you're so wet."</p> <p>I had my eyes closed now and closed them. I pushed up as far as I could and pushed down. He slid his cock almost all the way in my pussy. It felt different and different than I was used to. I felt so empty. It felt like I was going to be crushed. I couldn't believe that I was being fucked by my best friend. This was not right. I thought about leaving the room and going back to the party but I kept quiet.
