He took in my breathing and he pulled me toward him, wrapping his arms around me tightly. I didn't want to let go just yet. I tried to speak but he just kissed me and I let it take me in. He ran his fingers through mine and they moved over my lips, stopping just around my eyes before sliding in again. His fingers felt so good moving over me, I couldn't get enough of them. He wanted me and I wanted him. As I became more focused on his fingers he kissed my lips and then the corner of my eye and he looked up at me. He reached down and began rubbing his hardness against my leg. I couldn't help but give him a hard little squeeze and I felt his hips press forward slightly. Before he could pull me closer, I moved my hips as well, hoping he'd follow suit.</p> <p>He didn't, however, because he let his hands run over my chest and his fingers moved back to my body. He took both nipples in his fingers and squeezed them gently and then they became fully erect and begging to be released. I could already sense he was moving towards me and it made me anxious. I was so afraid that I wouldn't get the hard dick I desperately wanted. He knew that what was left wasn't going to stop him just yet. He took his other hand and slid it under my leg and around my ass. He lifted it up and pulled it up and then back a little to make sure. As soon as it seemed to his liking I felt it against my wet crack. It was slippery from all of the lubrication that he'd applied and it made it more slippery. He looked up at me again, his face flushed and a slight smile in his eyes. I felt the head of his shaft pressing against my slit, he was so hard. He was just starting to push it inside me and it felt wonderful. He let go of me, then ran his hand up and down my sides, over my stomach and down to my thighs. When he reached the outer edge of my shorts he slipped a couple fingers inside my shorts and gently touched the very end of my penis. He was running his fingers up and down my shaft and he started to tease the tip of it with his fingers. Then he took my hard shaft and squeezed it up and down. This made it very stiff and excited me so much I began thrusting my penis more and more urgently into his hands. I felt the head of his dick against the top of my crack and he was touching it, making it jump and swell. I was feeling the heat of the end of his dick and I had to admit that the excitement of the act thrilled me. I wasn't going to last too long.</p> <p>He began moving, slowly at first, then starting up a steady rhythm. His hips were moving faster at the top of the up thrust, causing them to increase in speed and force. I was so aroused that I didn't care about anything else, for it was my turn to be turned on. Just as I had told him, I was becoming as aroused by what was going on inside of me as he was, because my excitement was escalating rapidly. I couldn't contain my pleasure any longer, I felt myself tense up and I felt my penis explode, sending hot spurts of cum into his hands. It was quite a load and he kept pumping up and down on my cock, getting every drop. Finally he let go and I felt his erection soften against my body. He slowly released me from my grasp and I moved my arms to allow my shorts to fall off. He slid his hand back to my penis and I lay down on the ground as he knelt beside me, wrapping his arms around my shoulders and his head to one shoulder and his hand on my thigh. I was exhausted, I felt my body move around and it was a warm feeling, I couldn't remember feeling like this before very long.</p> <p>I lay there, still quivering, trying to catch my breath by slowly rubbing my fingers through his hair, feeling his chest against my back. Then he put his hand over mine and squeezed it gently, looking at me and smiling. I squeezed his hand with my own and we laid there for quite a long time, listening to the sounds of distant thunder and the occasional wind.</p> <p>We lay there for so long that we didn't even hear a light knocking at the door. He sat up on the steps, my hand on his shoulder. He pulled his arms to his chest and the door opened and in came the owner of the place. She looked up at him, smiling, but not in the same sort of way as the owner of the place, the owners of me, and it was clear then that my mind was not on her or my situation.</p> <p>As she stepped back to give me time to make my mind up, she said, "Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
