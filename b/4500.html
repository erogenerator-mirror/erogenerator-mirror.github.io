He must have known because he started to rub it up again with his lips. He moved my skirt back up the rest of the way so it barely covered my ass, but when I felt his fingers between my legs, I knew it was just his finger and a small bottle of lotion sitting there. When his hand moved onto my pussy, it almost made me cum again.</p> <p>He got up from me to lie beside me and just looked at me. He was still a handsome, young man, with dark hair and a handsome face. For a moment I wondered if I had really crossed a line with him. Maybe he's an idiot, I thought to myself. I mean, I'd never really considered doing what we had done, but maybe that would make him feel all the more. Maybe I'd really enjoy the feeling of him in my hand.</p> <p>I think in that moment I was going to agree with a simple yes to what I was about to do with him. I know I said I wouldn't do it because of what I was about to commit to him, but I didn't care. When he sat there, looking at me, I just smiled up at him. He pulled me over to face him. It was still my first time but he wasn't all that bad looking, and I wanted this so much I could barely sit still. With one hand he started to stroke my hair. When I reached out and ran my hand down his chest, something told me that he really didn't do that. There was no kissing this time. Our tongues explored each other's mouths.</p> <p>His hand moved to the back of my head and I almost couldn't see him any more, but when his fingers brushed by my face, I knew it was right that I was going to do it. I took one of his hands and pulled it to my breasts. I had never done that before, and as I cupped his hand under me, felt for the first time I wanted to do it. I wanted to feel his fingers in my cunt, all over.</p> <p>We continued to kiss, even when he began to move his hand down my stomach, leaving a wet trail from top to bottom. He was touching me with his fingers and I was wet for him. When his fingers began brushing in my pubic hair, I knew I'd made the right decision. In just a short time I was so wet I actually felt it oozing down my thighs. When he moved the tips up across my clit, I had to moan into his mouth. I had to reach back and grab his big dick to keep from sliding over the edge. I couldn't believe what I was doing.</p> <p>I had already imagined taking charge of him, at least the way I planned on doing it, but it had come back all too soon. I didn't think I could do anything like that. He would just have to fuck me. He would just have to fuck me. Or he could just fuck me.</p> <p>He didn't disappoint me. He moved his finger down and began to stroke the very tip of my clit. The moment he ran over it, I thought I'd never felt anything like that before. My body was on fire, and I could hardly breathe. But when he moved his finger down again, I knew the moment had suddenly arrived. He rubbed the tip along my slit before easing the tip inside. Just the tip.</p> <p>Before I knew it, he was moving back out. And then in. Up and down, in and out, all the while moving his fingers over my clit with the same rhythm. His fingers were sliding over and around the outside of me, just inside and all around. The only thing that could ever be more perfect than his fingers felt was his dick. I couldn't remember ever feeling better or hornier. I never knew I could feel that way. It was like the whole sex was a moment lost in these two bodies that had been made to love each other.</p> <p>My body was alive all of a sudden, and in a rush I almost felt the weightlessness of the world that had once been inside my own. That sense of belonging was just too much. I'd never felt anything like what I was feeling that day. Like the most important thing in the universe.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do you," he whispered, "Do you need me to do you"?</p> <p>I just looked at him, not knowing what to say. I wasn't sure what else to say, so I just nodded yes.</p> <p>"Then do it," he said as he put his finger to his lips, "just do it for me. No other words, no more than anything, ok?"</p> <p>We lay there in silence for a while, but I know I wasn't sure how longâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
