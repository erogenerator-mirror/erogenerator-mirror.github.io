He told me to go sit on the other end of the bed. I watched him, wondering where he would take me next and if I should do the same. He walked to my side, got on all fours in front of me to kiss my neck. Then he spread my legs and entered me. I closed my eyes and thought that it was too good and the rest was going to be fun. He moved at me and I had my first real orgasm. I hadn't really liked being on my feet, but I let him.</p> <p>I had trouble to hold on to the sheets after that and then he said, "I'm ready now, let's talk."</p> <p>"What were you ready for?" I asked.</p> <p>"I really needed that and you are going to make me feel so good."</p> <p>"Yes, I was ready to make you forget I ever wanted you, to just be my boyfriend." I said.</p> <p>"I don't want to forget but I guess it's my job for sure." He said. His smile and kiss made him seem even bigger. I couldn't take this anymore. I needed him inside me or had to be inside myself. "You want me inside that tight cunt." I asked.</p> <p>"Yes and I want you to be me inside me."</p> <p>He kissed my neck and then ran his hands down over my breasts to caress me. He worked in his kisses up to my ears to lick them first, than my chin and then down to my chest. He pulled the front of my top off and licked it.</p> <p>He kissed my nipple and then looked me in the eyes. "I want you to see my cock and it's ready hard for you."</p> <p>"I'm ready."</p> <p>He turned around and I watched as his ass disappeared into the crack of my ass. He was not as good looking as I remember, but he was very fit and he moved with a nice body. "Your ass is so beautiful."</p> <p>"You don't have anything in mind?" I laughed.</p> <p>"Not for you but for someone you like." He grinned.</p> <p>"You're going to put this cock inside me and I can't wait for another opportunity." I said.</p> <p>"I have one or maybe two or three here." I giggled.</p> <p>He got on all fours behind me and said, "Come on then."</p> <p>I felt him pushing his cock inside me. Just the head, but it hurt. Then he moved it all the way. "Oh, that's okay, really good. You feel so good."</p> <p>He just kept going back and forth for a couple minutes and I kept a hand on his ass to pull him even deeper inside my body. "Oh, you feel so good." I said, almost crying.</p> <p>"I want you to really feel good. Do you like it?" He asked.</p> <p>"I love it. Oh, yes. Fuck me deeper. Ah, that's it. Oh, yes I love it."</p> <p>"Say it." He said.</p> <p>"Fuck me deeper. Don't hurt me." I said. I got out a few words to keep him from hurting himself or trying to tell him that I loved the feeling of his cock moving within me.</p> <p>"Say it!" He said.</p> <p>"I love it. You feel so good. Oh, yes fuck me. Fuck me again." I was close to coming and he said to hold on, "I won't come until there is someone else in place who can handle it. I promise."</p> <p>He fucked me more and harder and when he did I knew that he was about to come. "Oh, fuck, I'm coming." He said.</p> <p>He didn't pull out. When he did he yelled, "Yes, right there. Come in me. I want it, oh, yes, yes."</p> <p>He held his cock buried inside me. "I never came like this before. That felt too good."</p> <p>"I love you." I said.</p> <p>"You are a very beautiful woman."</p> <p>"I've known that you've done this before."</p> <p>"For a long time."</p> <p>He kissed me again and asked, "Are you ready to do this again?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Are you ready to have more of this?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes." I said. I wanted it so much. I didn't think I could take more, but then I realized what he was asking and it sounded like fun.</p> <p>"How can you help me out with more?"</p> <p>"Take off my clothes." I said.</p> <p>"I will be back in a little while."
