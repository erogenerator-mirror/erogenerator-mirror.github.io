I knew that's not true. It was possible for two people to create a mental connection and they did it but, at that precise moment, there was not one thing that could be construed as a physical connection between them.</p> <p>"Are you two still in there?" She said loudly. There was no doubt in her mind that his name was James' but, she did not feel like she knew it. It was like his physical presence was not there anymore and she felt the presence of a soul in their minds. "I need to go and change into something more comfortable."</p> <p>James looked over at Chris who looked away from the scene then over at his friend. "Okay, I'll go and change and do something."</p> <p>James left the locker room and he and Chris walked out on the other side of the lockers, past the other members of the gym trying to figure out what to do.</p> <p>"I should go too, I need to change because I like the look of you," Chris answered. "I'm sure he enjoyed that."</p> <p>"I know you did, I can't wait to see you next time you come by," James replied. "You know you can't wait to see me then Chris."</p> <p>"I am here too, I told him this morning and I can't wait for tomorrow. I'll see you next Monday."</p> <p>"Okay," he smiled.</p> <p>The next day, however, before going out to workout, James changed to basketball shorts and a long sleeved shirt. He thought he would go to the game and maybe he could find his girlfriend. Instead he decided that he would meet Chris and they could go to dinner. Chris looked over at James with a confused look on his face. He felt James' presence in that moment. He looked at Chris and noticed the slight sadness in his friend's eyes and he knew he could trust him. James was a pretty person and despite what his body had told him, being in his element was not a bad thing.</p> <p>"I'm not a big eater, but that would be okay with me," James suggested with a laugh.</p> <p>"Oh, you are big," Chris told him.</p> <p>"Thanks," James grinned as they walked outside to the truck for their ride. Even though he was a little light headed from all the beer he had consumed, what was an ordinary day together was amazing. After they got in the truck, James leaned over and gave Chris a peck on the cheek then they were off.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Duke and Chris walked down to the restaurant. James had told Chris not to drive since he couldn't drive himself and Chris agreed. Neither they looked at each other but they talked.</p> <p>"So, the movie was really good?"</p> <p>"It was okay," Chris laughed and replied, "I didn't mind seeing the movie or anything."</p> <p>"I didn't either, but that wasn't as scary as the movie," he joked.</p> <p>"Well, it was funny and it kind of made me laugh," Chris said with a laugh. He then added, "I thought it was going to be much funnier if it was just a movie but I guess that's why we did it out," Chris smiled.</p> <p>Chris laughed again. "So, I've thought a lot about that movie out and when you went shopping and I found out what the theater looks like, you're the first in the movies to actually go in. Well, I'm thinking I went in with a new girlfriend that I'm sure is going to be very happy to see you again, so I told her if she was happy she would do it. She said she is."</p> <p>"Yeah," Chris smiled. "I'm looking forward to seeing her again too."</p> <p>*</p> <p>After checking out, James and Chris went back to the movie. Chris had found it and Chris, when they got back to the theater, they sat down.</p> <p>"So, I think that your new girlfriend is ready for more action, so I want to let you know she has been really great." Chris told him. "And she was really hot, too. The way she was dressed and everything, you must really love her."</p> <p>James looked down and he knew Chris' eyes were on him like a bug. And, he had no idea how much he missed seeing Chris's eyes on him.</p> <p>"Really?" Chris asked with a laugh. "That was a lot for some reason."</p> <p>"Yeah," James replied. "She had this wild look about her that I think you could get used to seeing."</p> <p>"Like, is there a certain kinky streak that she might have?" Chris askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
