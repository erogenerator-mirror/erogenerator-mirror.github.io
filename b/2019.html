Again without thinking, I turned around and gave the man a wink of my own. He was only vaguely aware of a man in the doorway but I heard him say "Hi, can I get your beer" as he walked out.</p> <p>Releasing the man I began to relax again, and I began to relax knowing he was there. As I continued to relax, I noticed that he looked to be in his late 40's and was very nicely built. When I went to shake hands with my new man, this time, I made sure to press my hand firmly into his, giving him a hug. When our hands parted, I had trouble keeping my gaze from his face, but that changed when I met his eyes.</p> <p>The man, still very much in shock, took my hand, and took my arm as I followed him out of door. We walked slowly, keeping the conversation light and not taking our eyes off each other. When we reached the bar, he made a motion for me to sit on one of the barstools near the door. A few minutes later, we had our drinks and were beginning to feel a stronger connection. I could feel the excitement from the drinks being applied to my body as he began to openly stare at me with a grin. When I had my first drink, it was very mild and nothing much, but the excitement was evident in my movements. I sat as close to him as I could, feeling his right leg rub against mine, my left leg was stretched around his thigh until he could feel my leg against his body. I could feel my face flush as he made small talk with me, with my skirt up around my waist with only my blouse covering me. I was so much in sync with the stranger I was with, that the more we were talking, the more I felt the excitement build.</p> <p>The next few drinks were good and he finally told me that he had been married for a while and now that he was moving to a different area, he had gotten a divorce. He was now single and had no intention of leaving. I felt that my attraction was so strong now that I was feeling the effects of an alcohol intake and I felt his hand on my thigh. As our conversation was getting very heavy, the stranger reached his hand to me and began to caress it. The feelings of excitement were rising again as he continued to rub my leg, but I could tell from the intensity in his eyes that the effects he was having were even stronger. His hand moved to my exposed right breast and the stranger's fingers began to rub my stiffening nipple. Feeling that familiar touch between my legs, I couldn't hold myself back any longer and began to unbutton his shirt. When it was open, the stranger's fingers began to run lightly over my nipple, pinching and pulling on it. As I removed the shirt from my shoulders, he lifted his head to see me and began a small kiss on my lips.</p> <p>The stranger leaned in closer and, placing his mouth on mine, our tongues began to dance and explore each other's mouths. With each passing, our desire grew as we grew more and more excited. A part of my brain had told me that if I didn't stop, I could end this right now, but all the feelings in my body were stronger, almost in tune with the stranger. I was aware of how wet my panties would be, and that my hands where now reaching out for the stranger's body.</p> <p>The barman had come over and began to talk with us a lot. I told him that I had had very good luck tonight. By then, we had a great time, and I really began to feel the effects of all the drinks.</p> <p>Over the next several hours, we had a great time, and I got to know the stranger quite well, and he felt the same way. After we had had our drinks, we walked back into my apartment hand in hand. He asked if I had any plans for the evening, and I said that I did, as he said he would pick me up afterwards.</p> <p>The stranger said it sounded like a plan as both of us got out of the car and began to walk toward his apartment building. As we got closer we were still very much in synch. He handed me the key, taking me by the hand. As we walked through the door, I could feel his gaze on me. I opened the apartment door to give my keys to the stranger, and before I could turn away from him, he placed his arms around my waist, our chests pressed together as he whispered in my ear, "If you were a good girl tonight, I would let you leave."</p> <p>With those words outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
