He had taken the time to shave himself, and had chosen a clean pair of pants and a t-shirt. He had decided that he would need to find underwear that would fit the situation because at this point he didn't care if this was a mistake. He just wanted to get to sleep and sleep well that night. There was nowhere he wanted to get much rest. His mind was in turmoil. He hadn't slept very well, and he couldn't bring himself to admit it, but he couldn't stay awake on a bad cold.</p> <p>The house was immaculate. The house was small, yet it was cozy. His friend Ryan helped him out, so he spent the time at the kitchen. Ryan had found something on the TV that he was interested in, and brought the wine to him. Before he got to the bedroom, he felt the world turn to mush in his heart. He was in the same room, completely alone, but he wasn't in a bed. It was just as he had hoped. The room was dark, and he felt like everything was moving. He sat watching for a minute, and then he felt as though someone was looking into his eyes, and he recognized his friend's voice on the other side of the room. The tension was broken, and he leaned back on one elbow. "Well, well, how do you like my surprise?" He said. His voice was shaky, and it wasn't the same kind of voice that Ryan used, but it was enough to make Ryan's brain catch up. It was Ryan who had put on a show for him the previous night. It was no longer a surprise of a man being gay, but the one-upmanship and respect, and the way he kept himself from being a complete dick. Ryan was used to being told to hang out with guys, and he would never treat them any differently, and he knew there was a lot more room for himself in his closet. The only thing that hadn't been accepted in any of his other relationship relationships were hookups, and there was a whole lot more to a relationship than that. The other two relationships had been one of convenience, but for what reason he had ended up leaving that one particular one. The other one made him feel like a piece of meat; not a person; but he didn't regret that.</p> <p>"You're joking," he said, "that sounds so much better than a gay guy on the phone." He was still a little unsure of himself, and if the man had been in a scene, he probably would have said something to make his friend jealous. A part of his conscience was trying to force him to do this, but it was just too hard, and she felt too bad about it.</p> <p>Ryan looked at him in amazement. He had never met one in a situation like this before, and for some reason they all seemed like such an odd couple. "You're joking? No, that just won't do." If they both hadn't been so nice to him, it would have felt weird. After all, it would be easy to tell them apart. But still, he didn't want to do anything to embarrass himself, he didn't care about the fact that he had been given no one to take home. "I was just being nice," he responded, "it'll seem natural."</p> <p>"It'll seem natural if you don't," Ryan said, "because I know there is nothing natural about what you are doing now." He looked over at the bed where he had first met the two women before and smiled. "Do you have any idea how I got this house built? I've spent more time in it than I should have. I was amazed at how far and as much as I wanted to throw the sheets into the shower there was so much to get off with. We didn't even think to buy this house until this weekend." He smiled as he told the truth behind his statement, and his thoughts returned to a happier time that they would ever be.</p> <p>"How long have you been planning this?" Ryan asked. For just one day, they could take an all-night road trip. Maybe if he could find a girlfriend that wasn't so much a guy-bitch as a woman.</p> <p>"You haven't heard me ask," Ryan replied, "I haven't been waiting for a break for long."</p> <p>Ryan was a little surprised that he could feel himself getting turned on. "I couldn't have guessed." He laughed. "Why?"</p> <p>"It just seems natural, like everyone else, when the two of you are out of your mind," Ryan responded, "it's like we always were happy and happy together, and as long as we aren't apart it doesn't matter."</p> <p>"Is that why, when you first met me, I neverâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
