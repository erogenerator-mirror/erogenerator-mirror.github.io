I said, my own confusion evident in my voice... it was clear as day in my eyes; I was beginning to wonder again. That the reason she hadn't asked me out in so long was that she was afraid of me doing the right thing.</p> <p>"Honey," Kelly said, "you're about to marry a woman I want to marry but I have some bad news."</p> <p>My breath caught in my throat and my heart was a little too excited... the possibility that it might happen, and the thought of doing the right thing in bed just made my heart beat faster.</p> <p>"Do you really think I'll be able to get away with it?" I asked.</p> <p>Kelly smiled at me, "I'm no wild cat; I think you can at least get away with something that will satisfy your curiosity as long as you tell me." Kelly went back to her cooking as I sat across the table from her; her words had caught in my throat again.</p> <p>"I don't want to be alone in a relationship with a woman..." I said, "I just want to be with someone I love." I gave a shaky laugh. I didn't want to be alone with a relationship in which she was not involved... I didn't need to get together with her that night again; if I was that interested in her I didn't want to lose her again either...</p> <p>"That sounds like a lot," Kelly said, "I can understand some of the frustration."</p> <p>"That is not what I'm talking about," I said, "I just think you should be happy that it would not make us 'run off together and never come back'. I'm not going to be happy that you're not happy with me but I'm not going to feel that way about you either."</p> <p>Kelly seemed to be in a little better shape and when she walked away in the other direction I was almost relieved; this felt more like a commitment... not the same thing, but certainly it wasn't going to be a goodbye fuck either.</p> <p>"What are we going to do about it, Mark? I can't live my life and not know what I do." Kelly was smiling for the first time since walking away and I found my heart breaking when she said that. My mind was numb with so much anticipation and my head was spinning... this was all so confusing.</p> <p>"I'll take care of it for you, Honey." I smiled at the word and looked at her. She was the one who had to be nervous when she told me that the night before she had asked me out on a date... and I hadn't made the same mistake again. Kelly is what I found myself feeling when she came back; she had a way of saying she was ready for me... just a little bit too much.</p> <p>"No honey; you don't have to worry about anything," she said, "I can be that way."</p> <p>Kelly was sitting on the kitchen counter; her legs were slightly parted and I could see the bare skin of her mound; just enough not to look too obvious... at least not unless you're looking at the top of a pair of full ripe breasts... Kelly didn't appear to be looking at what she was doing. It made me wonder if she was planning or waiting for something else to happen.</p> <p>At the same time I was thinking this, Kelly was thinking that same thing and the closer she got to the kitchen and more of the things I was thinking made me doubt it. Maybe she already had something in mind too. Something I had longed for all my life; perhaps something that never even came close to what I had wanted. It was a question I didn't have a problem going down with her... not at all. For the first time since I started working, I wasn't looking forward to something and even if things had turned out different it was still an adventure and I don't like having my life end over anything like that...</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>So I guess that's another story. I have a lot to write... I think it was probably in my best will to write it... I don't really believe in all of this happening... it wasn't all happening I had to do and if there was to be more to do... and if there was to be nothing else... what ever happened in my life before I got here... I guess I just got caught up in the moment...</p> <p>If you liked this story, you might as well start the next one by reading "Kelly Does Her Deal Make the Change</p> <p>My thanks goes to everyone on here who has been getting a response, whether it's good or bad... or just random.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>- Mark</p> <p>Part 1 of 2 -</p> <p>"Ohâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
