It was just the three of us. We've only been there for about 30 minutes. I'm surprised you'd take a chance on it; let alone me."</p> <p>Now he was really confused. "I'm sorry to be the one who gave you a freebie. I guess it's nice that I have the freedom to ask when you want to do something, because you know I'd never force myself on anyone."</p> <p>"I'm not your wife. When will you get your permission to do anything, or even what you want to do?"</p> <p>"You're not the one who gave me permission. You've given me permission to do what I want to do. I guess I could have asked the other day if I had known I was giving you the opportunity. I guess I did and I apologize for that.</p> <p>"I hope I'm not out for good tonight. I'm going to watch my boyfriend's little buddy play with each of us, and you can watch him too."</p> <p>"There's a good boy. I'm going to help your buddy have a nice time."</p> <p>"I'm going to do a little dance." I took off my jacket and put it in the chair next to the bed. It was a tiny skirt that was just enough to cover my underwear and nothing more.</p> <p>I started off by undoing the buttons on my blouse. By the time, I was done, I was naked. He was still sitting at his computer, his cock still exposed and rock hard.</p> <p>I turned away from him and put my hands over my panties and then I slowly pulled them down my legs. As they came to rest on my ankles, my skirt fell to the floor.</p> <p>This time, I did not turn.</p> <p>"Oh, my, you're gorgeous."</p> <p>I smiled coyly.</p> <p>"And I want you to watch me dance for my husband. Maybe give him his wish and give him a little surprise gift."</p> <p>He got up and watched. I could feel his eyes going to my ass and my legs, and I couldn't look at my watch.</p> <p>"Oh, my God, don't touch me, it's embarrassing! Please untie me!"</p> <p>He sat on the bed.</p> <p>I walked over and knelt down. Now I was facing him and he was sitting there in the chair. I could see the bulge in his pants. When I reached out and pulled his zipper down, it pulled down. I took my right hand and pulled it out. My hand was trembling. I opened his pants and his cock sprang out. It was still fully clothed and I put my hand around its thickness.</p> <p>As I squeezed, it grew to a large and impressive member. Not much length or thickness, but the rest was very thick and my hand barely able to take in it. His head poked out from his head and it was as big as I had imagined. I could see his cock pointing skyward.</p> <p>I put my other hand on his ass and felt his heat. He smelled like a combination of soap and his own scent. I turned him around and pulled him out so I could see his entire cock. I'm glad because the sight of his hard cock made me want his in my mouth again.</p> <p>After a while, I dropped to my knees and slowly began to undress. It was so much better this way than in the chair; I could do it slowly with a cock in my mouth. With one hand, I cupped his testicles and massaged them. I kept my other hand on his ass so I could reach around and stroke his cock faster.</p> <p>He was breathing hard. I thought it would help him orgasm quickly, but he needed it now. I stopped for a minute and looked at him and said, "Not so fast baby. We've only got about 20 more minutes. Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes" he said. I had another idea. I stood up and got off the bed. I picked up some rope and took it toward the hook at the bottom of the bed. It was about 6 inches long and at least as good as anything you can pick up. I brought the rope up to where his cock was now standing out from him. I stood right in front of him and leaned forward.</p> <p>His cock was now between my breasts as I slowly slid them down it. I got the rope from the hook and tied it off to each hook and made sure to tie it tight. I then went back to him. I wrapped one arm around his cock and slowly slid my lips down it.</p> <p>His tip was just the right height and weight for me. I was still in all my glory.</p> <p>I heard him moan and his cock seemed to twitch as he moaned. I put my hand on the back of myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
