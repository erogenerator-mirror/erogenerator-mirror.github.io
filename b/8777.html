I didn't know what to say or do at that point. Should I go?</p> <p>"I'll just ask him what he wanted to do, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"I'm not trying to turn that into the next time you're alone anymore," he said. "I just want something to happen. A relationship that we are really comfortable in, that we can share. He knows that I'm the person he wants, too."</p> <p>"He knows that?" I asked.</p> <p>"He knows that I am a woman of very good character, and he likes me that much," she said and I got that feeling in my stomach again.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>She went on. "I don't want another boyfriend, I want a guy of equal status. You know, like you. You know that right?"</p> <p>"Yeah?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah it's okay," she said with all sincerity. "In fact, why not?"</p> <p>Now it was my turn to say something, and I went on, "When he got you over here, I almost forgot what I was going to tell you. We've never met before, and I have no idea what to say right now. I'm really sorry and it's going to take much more than this."</p> <p>"Why don't you just give me directions to the dorm, then take me to meet him. I'll give you your number and you can call me if you want. That's it, you give me your number. I don't think he's even into you."</p> <p>"He's not my boyfriend?"</p> <p>"Nope, but he has the ability to be. Now can I just be with him, please?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Okay. Let me see," she said, taking a deep breath and extending her hand. I took it and we said goodbye and headed off to meet him at the dorm. We said our goodbyes and I went home and went into my house. I set the alarm so that I didn't need it, and sat for a while thinking and pondering things. I had an idea of where I could go on this relationship-less relationship. After all they're over I'm stuck with him. There is no way in hell that I'm going to be able to have a relationship with Mark. He's already in his room. So I decided to call the room, but leave it for when I get there. Then I called the number on the phone and left a message. It worked. He came to the door and I told him to come in as soon as he got off the elevator. I went back to my room to sleep like a baby, and I dreamed about what it would be like to get into that sexy guy's pants.</p> <p>The day before my meeting with Mark was the usual event, though nothing ever happened. Usually Mark was ready to make some excuse to leave, at which point I would get out of the house and let the guys in to help with whatever it was they needed. Mark was the first to get up this morning. He gave me the address of the dorm building and we walked toward the dorm. I had already arranged to get some work done, so after the first few minutes I was really working hard when he handed me a piece of paper as my lunch. "Here," he said. "What am I doing? I'm not ready for this."</p> <p>"Don't you want to do this?" I said.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, giving me a questioning look. I shrugged my shoulders and looked at him. "I don't know. I don't think I like doing this. It doesn't sound like me," he said as he gave me another look, but I was already getting into his pants. I was right there with him as he lifted up my skirt and saw that I was wearing cotton panties. He was surprised, when my crotch was already wet, so he pulled away. "Oh, yeah, let me just..." I looked around and could see some of the other girls around us were doing the same, but most of them were gone. We walked to the door and Mark took off his tie and shirt. His shirt lay on the floor.</p> <p>"It's kind of late, doesn't it?" he asked, as I was still in my skirt.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "It's kind of late now."</p> <p>"Why don't you come up?" he asked. I took two steps and got right in his face, before I could think. "What? Why?" he said after I gave him a big smile. "Because I don't want to do it," I said as I moved away from him and faced the doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
