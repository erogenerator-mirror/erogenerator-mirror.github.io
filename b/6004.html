I could hear as she talked. "I am so happy for you. I know it is not the same but I am happy for you right now. My sister and I, well we, we had to make that happen. We have all of the right parts. You will still have you father and your sister. I am very happy for you. I still love you for who you are. Your father's and I have a special relationship with you. We both love each other. I know you will love him. I just hope it will work through."</p> <p>She was really shaking and just stared. "I love you too. How can I say this?"</p> <p>"You don't. I love the fact that I've loved you since the day I met you. I love your courage to speak. We just haven't had many words during this last year, at least not words."</p> <p>Her eyes were full of tears and her eyes were still red from crying. She said the wrong thing now. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>I took her hands in mine. "That's all right. We both hurt and don't want to lose that. That's something we'll always be grateful for. It would have happened had we hadn't stopped you from getting away."</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you."</p> <p>I didn't really think about it at first. Then I told her. "I still love you. I will always love you. It won't change how we feel about each other."</p> <p>We both looked up at her. "You love me don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes. You're my daughter-in-law."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>Sitting in my bed in our pajamas, we went to sleep at a decent angle. It took me a little while to figure out I didn't love her enough and that what went on back home wasn't my fault. Still, I had to go through with it. I asked her what she really wanted.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter what you say. It's what I do as a father that's the issue."</p> <p>I gave her a squeeze and then lay down to sleep as well. I couldn't sleep because I realized what she'd said. There was no way I could have done anything like what I'd done to myself for years. I had been the perfect man for her.</p> <p>The next day, my mom was on the phone again with a guy with the name that I'd been told by my father that he knew I loved her. She sounded like an older version of her old self.</p> <p>"Good morning, John. What can I do to help you?"</p> <p>A lot had happened the last few days since then. I thought it was a great deal since there were a lot things I wanted to say that I thought were right. I didn't see Mom leave before I had to stop talking. When I was done, I was able to get all the words out quickly in my next words that I was trying to give her.</p> <p>She got a strange look in her eyes, and it was clear then what we were about to do was illegal even if it was in the country. A couple of people wanted to talk about it that didn't matter. I really wanted to talk about it with Mom anyway.</p> <p>"Okay, okay, okay. Are you there?"</p> <p>"I am."</p> <p>They were talking about her and my mom and a couple of other people at work. I guess everyone was aware of that. I went back to my bed and just tried to imagine what they were talking about.</p> <p>I knew that what they were talking about was the fact that I was a father of two girls. But I had no idea who they were talking about. But they seemed to have a connection that went through them and started to take shape. They were talking about me. I had to wonder if what they had done to me was really what they did.</p> <p>"What have you been up to?"</p> <p>"I can't remember the last time the two of you talked."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Well, it's hard to think of it as being a day with no resolution and no sex for one night. But when I got home the last time you were home, it was just the two of us. And it was just your two of us. You remember your mother with her lover, do you?"</p> <p>"Yes, but..."</p> <p>"Then it makes no sense for us to be making love."</p> <p>We agreed it was obvious what I was talking about. It was the sex talk. Maybe they could tell by the way they were talking.</p> <p>"And...?" My mom was asking it at the same time. But she was giving voice to the whole thing forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
