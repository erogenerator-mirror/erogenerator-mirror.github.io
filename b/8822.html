You know I love you, and I love being with you."</p> <p>"So we can always be together?"</p> <p>"We can be together forever. Don't you see? I'm never going to be the same woman again without you."</p> <p>"I never thought you'd be the one, honey. But we'll always be together, and I don't want to hurt either of us by getting too involved."</p> <p>"I know. It's not that I don't love you. I'm trying. And, you will always be the most important part of me."</p> <p>After this outburst, he got up and walked with me to the bedroom. We sat on the bed and kissed.</p> <p>"I got up too fast," I said. I pulled him on top of me and began to kiss his neck and his chest, then moved to his chest, his nipples, his stomach, his belly button, before kissing his abdomen and moving toward his groin.</p> <p>"Oh, my," I said when he felt the wet area between my legs through my panties.</p> <p>"That feels good," he said.</p> <p>I pulled his boxers off and found his erection as I wrapped my hand around the shaft. He looked quizzically at me.</p> <p>"Oh, no. We aren't done just yet. We have lots and lots to do."</p> <p>But his face showed his objections. He was too busy trying to convince me.</p> <p>"Baby, this is too dangerous. Please let me come inside you. I want to fuck you while we're both on this bed."</p> <p>I wasn't having any part of his proposal; my love for him was still very strong. My pussy was soaking. For him I said, "I don't want to hurt you, sweetheart."</p> <p>"It'll never ever hurt you. I love you." There it was. It was all the way. I'd just made an honest and sincere statement.</p> <p>Then, "Please. Don't make me go, okay?"</p> <p>"Of course," he said, still not taking his eyes off me.</p> <p>He took me in his arms and kissed me.</p> <p>I was now kissing him as well, my hands reaching down toward his body, where I touched his penis.</p> <p>"Oh!" he said, as his hand wrapped around my butt again.</p> <p>"Can we go to sleep?" I asked.</p> <p>"Why don't we get into bed; I'm sure we can get rid of the pain. I think we can sleep just fine."</p> <p>Then he stopped me and took me to a chair. It was now a night of lovemaking and sex. This time was my favorite. We both enjoyed it and we both wanted each other.</p> <p>At the end of the night, we both got out and we lay down on our sides, and he kissed my body and I stroked his penis and fondled his balls. I rubbed my legs together and touched his balls again. I said that I wanted to come inside him as he'd already done and he said, "I want to put my sperm deep inside you." As I got close, he said, "You just stay at the edge for me a little longer. I won't get off. Please."</p> <p>"Okay. Here comes the head of my penis, I want to make you feel good." I moved the top half of it to the left to take that head of man meat. I wanted him to slide inside me.</p> <p>He slowly slid the head of his cock into me as I was getting closer. When I felt his head pop in, he put more pressure by pushing his pelvis down and pushing his pelvis forward. I moaned louder that time.</p> <p>Then he slowly pushed his penis all the way inside me until the tip was just out.</p> <p>"You feel so good," he said, looking deeply into my eyes.</p> <p>He kept slowly pushing and pushing as I was moaning loudly all the time. I knew it was time and I had to have him inside me. "Don't go," I whispered but it sounded more like encouragement than real.</p> <p>I felt his penis sliding in and out, up and down as he talked to my ear. "I love feeling your vagina close around me and I want to fuck you forever. I'm going to come in you just the same way with this beautiful penis."</p> <p>His breathing was getting more raspy. So were mine. My breathing was getting shorter and louder. Finally it got so loud I thought someone would hear us as we started to come together. He continued to whisper softly in my ear, as the orgasm intensified in my groin.
