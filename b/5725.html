You're right. When can I see you?"</p> <p>"Why you going to be here? This just sounds so much better without the stress of the office."</p> <p>"I know but... it's just... it is really hard, and we've been working hard. I've always been happy working in my field." She sighed and put her hands behind her head, running her fingers through her long red hair.</p> <p>"How about that time soon?"</p> <p>"I could really use the stress of work to help me focus." It felt as if my heart was racing.</p> <p>She didn't answer but stared at the blank look on my face as she considered what I said. Maybe she was over reacting, so to be more specific I needed some time to catch my own breath. We arrived at work a little after ten; about thirty minutes into work and when the lights went on my eyes opened slowly as I started to realize what I was standing in front of.</p> <p>The girl was stunning. She was wearing something that was a little more form fitting than you might see on your average secretary, but it was very sexy. It was a black dress that ended about mid length on the sides, giving it the same sort of "come hither" look as the skirt she was wearing. The hem reached the top of her thigh, the straps around her neck barely able to hide what the dress had. The dress went down her calves and the way it had draped around her feet was nothing short of sexy, even though she had her heels on. When she stood up the dress clung to her body with its soft material, leaving little to the imagination.</p> <p>She was standing before me; staring at me with a twinkle in her eye. Her long hair fell over her shoulders. She wore a silver ring on her right finger, and her wedding band was in place. Her lips were full and inviting though, as was mine. Our eyes met, we shared a brief moment of mutual delight but then began looking each other over, and I found myself wanting to kiss those beautiful lips. They were so soft even after having to fight off the urges of recent events. I could look into those sparkling dark eyes, take in the fullness of her lips, and have myself a moment.</p> <p>Her lips moved, taking in a deep breath as she inhaled the air. My mouth began to water and I couldn't help but smile. She stood still, letting her entire body float before me. She had long brown hair that fell into the middle of her face, and the color of the deepest blue was in her eyes, and as long as her fingers came down to meet them, her nails had the hint of dark eyes to them.</p> <p>"I don't think I've taken you at such a time, but it's been a while hasn't it?" she asked, extending her hand. "Would you be... excited to see you?" She smiled, raising her hand as if to shake mine. It was a moment I'd never expected.</p> <p>"Yes." I took her hand and we walked towards my car.</p> <p>"I've got a surprise for you. Take a seat and I'll put things in the trunk and put my car into the garage." She nodded and I leaned over to kiss her lips gently. I didn't know what it would be, but she tasted like strawberries. The first moment of our mouths met, I could feel myself growing to my full potential.</p> <p>"I think we're going to get a lot of work done tonight." I was pleased that I had made her so enthusiastic to talk to me.</p> <p>"You're sure you going to be here all night?" She nodded. "Okay, I'll just be your surprise."</p> <p>"You'll want your surprise then." She gave me a tight smile and leaned up to kiss me. Our lips met and I leaned back to see how I looked as her lips and tongue teased my body.</p> <p>"I'll be back in a flash."</p> <p>We kissed softly again, almost like we were just playing it out for the first time since the first day. My hands were on her waist, then up to her breasts; feeling the firmness and fullness there. Her hips pressed up to me and I could feel the heat emanating from her. I ran my hands up her arms, and rested them on her breasts. She took my face in her hands and leaned in to kiss me again, our tongues meeting in the middle. My hands were on her back, holding her still, and she reached down and ran her fingernails lightly up and down the length of my thigh, before pulling me back up. I groaned in pleasure as she teased me with her lips and her hands, while my hands had my mouth. I moved them down her back as she pulled me to lie on the hoodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
