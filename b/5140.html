You do?" she asked in a low voice.</p> <p>"Well, sort of..." he stuttered.</p> <p>She smiled, looking right into his eyes. "No, I mean it. You do." She raised her eyebrow and nodded, as she turned back around from the doorway where she had originally been standing. He watched her for a moment. Her blue eyes, the sexy smile, the curves of her body...he began to tremble at the sight, but he held it together, and smiled at her. "You like what you see, don't you? You like what you see," she asked and leaned in so close that his skin grazed her neck. He could feel her breath tickling his hairline. The feel of her breasts pressing against his chest, the feel of her hips swaying under his. Her soft lips against his cheek, his ear, his cheek as she pressed herself against him and her hand wandered over his chest to his nipple. He trembled as she pulled his shirt up, over his shoulder and off his shoulder, his long arm sliding around her waist, his hand sliding down to her hip. She pressed her thigh between his thigh and his. Their breathing laboured, as they struggled to keep quiet, their lust, their desires evident.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I..." he began, but she interrupted him. "Well...we've both got our panties down so to speak," she smiled wickedly, lifting her hand to him and running it over his hair again.</p> <p>"I'm sure glad we're not caught," she giggled, "unless you have to go to a toilet!"</p> <p>"I was about to have to," he smiled.</p> <p>She sat down in his lap. "You're a good lover," she smiled, as she kissed him on the lips. "You've gotten so much better."</p> <p>"Do you?" he asked, trying to move his hand up her skirt. "It's too late to complain about that," he teased as his hand moved under her bottom and his fingers slid inside her panties, his fingers moving over her clit.</p> <p>In the middle of this, they both heard a door open on the landing at the end of the hall, a male voice.</p> <p>They both froze.</p> <p>He put on a brave face as they waited to see who it was, but no one came. A voice was still talking as they heard a door shut down next to their own.</p> <p>"Who...who am I speaking with?" he thought.</p> <p>"It's Kari," she said quietly, looking back at him and raising her hand to her lips after licking it clean of the juices that flowed from his hand. "Is...is he still there?"</p> <p>"Not with you," he breathed as she stood up and walked around him. "I...can't, I...I can't."</p> <p>Kari looked at him. "You can't? What the hell?"</p> <p>He shook his head, in a small way. "No!" He couldn't seem to believe what he was seeing. She had stopped in front of the door and was putting on her panties, which she had just turned out without him even knowing. "Kari..."</p> <p>"I can't!"</p> <p>"Kari," he said, trying to calm his breathing.</p> <p>"What did we..." he began to say. "What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I mean, I don't know. I'm not really..."</p> <p>"Bull-mouthed," he said.</p> <p>"But we've been playing," she replied, pulling on the top button of her blouse again. "I'm wearing a bra."</p> <p>"You..." he stopped to think. "...are really?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure I'll be wearing it much more..."</p> <p>"And when could you wear it?" he asked, looking her up and down. He could see just how long her nipples had been as they stood out from her bosom. He began to feel dizzy with the thought of pulling it out over her chest and putting it on her. But the door to his room opened and two girls came rushing in.</p> <p>"Hello there!" said Kari when they saw them. "Are we interrupting anything?"</p> <p>"Er...yes, you are, are you having trouble?" one of them asked as she began to pull the panties out of their hangers. Kari didn't notice their hands on her hips or the movement of the material as it pulled away from her.</p> <p>"Mmm, maybe, just wait until you get a chance to try it..." she smirked as she stepped out.</p> <p>"But," she said, "myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
