Then I heard him say a few words. I heard him say "It looks like you enjoyed that, I bet I could use some more to go with my outfit."</p> <p>For a moment I was uncertain what to say, and then thought "I can't be doing this, what sort of wife are you now."</p> <p>I looked round to see what was happening and saw him pulling a black latex-covered cock out of his trousers. He was slowly stroking the cock while looking at me. Then in a louder voice he said," I'm thinking maybe I should come around and see if I can persuade you to let me have a go and enjoy you. What are you going to do about that?"</p> <p>To my delight, this wasn't any of his intention, I guess he's always been good at acting like this, and just as he said "Well OK, I'll take that as a yes, but, I hope you enjoyed it." I felt so embarrassed and so nervous.</p> <p>What the fuck, wasn't I going to let this creep, this old cock man, do anything? Why had I agreed to let him fuck me - even without telling him! I stood there feeling more and more nervous. He pulled his cock straight out of his trousers and handed it to me, while then saying," You know, you look beautiful like that, even hotter with a real big cock like you said you would. You look good enough to wear a black skirt and a sexy pair of thigh-highs!"</p> <p>This was too all right for me, but I was having such a good time and it was a great turn-on to him to be like that. He asked his old cock tool if its was a good enough excuse to go into town and buy a pair of black patent leather heels! The answer? Yeah, well, that wasn't exactly true, but there was no harm in what he said.</p> <p>"Come on," he said, "let's go and I'll pick you up in fifteen minutes." He took his trousers and knapsack and said," Now, I can't be too quick, there isn't any rush at that time of day. You might be uncomfortable at the shops, but it'll be fine with me. And don't you worry, I'll be here waiting for a good five minutes for you."</p> <p>Just then he looked at the clock on the wall next to a door that no one had looked in before, and then he turned and smiled at me, looking me up and down like a naughty schoolboy.</p> <p>"You're early, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yep I am," I replied, "now hurry up before I change my mind." I felt very self-conscious at this moment, having taken a lot of pressure off his body, despite looking as good as I dared, having the old cock of that old.</p> <p>"Not you, I think you are just trying to get in for the last thing." he replied, "I don't want you to think I'm an old, fat loser." He then went on to say," Well, I don't want to have to say anything now. I just want to admire your beautiful body. I hope you are comfortable in what we might be getting up to!"</p> <p>With that he kissed me again and walked out of the doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
