Don't be alarmed if this is not a new experience, just be relaxed and be yourself. What makes you do anything is up to your own judgment you decide. This is your way of being different."</p> <p>"Ok," she said with a smile. "Just one more thing. Let me know how it goes. I'll keep it just in case things get a little weird. Don't worry." She nodded and stood up, going to the restroom. "I think this was one of your favorite moments," She said with a smile. "Just keep it in mind."</p> <p>I nodded and got back in bed. This was going to be interesting.</p> <p>I awoke around 4 p.m. to the sound of someone crying downstairs. "Are you ok?" I asked. I was laying there just enjoying the sunshine as it caressed my skin. She was at my side, holding me and looking back at me.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "I was just crying to be safe." She squeezed me as she spoke, holding me softly.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry for what happened the other night. I am not sure what to do about it, I am sorry for calling you names," she whispered. I lifted my head to look her.</p> <p>"I don't know what to say about it," I said. To my surprise, I knew I should not have. I had not expected or expected any of this. The truth was, I thought it was time and now it was time. I pulled her closer and held her as we both cried for a moment. It was a small comfort.</p> <p>The world faded away as we wept in each other's arms. Tears ran down her face, down my cheeks and down my arms. She held us in her arms for a while as the storm raged outside. My mind was still foggy and I could not see clearly, but I had been thinking of her and the things she had done.</p> <p>Finally, we both came to our senses and started to get up.</p> <p>"We need to talk," she said after a minute. I could not help the smile that crossed her face.</p> <p>"I can't believe how lucky I am to have a friend like you," She said again. "I can't believe how lucky I am to be sleeping next to you," she said as she wiped her chin. "That was so amazing," she continued.</p> <p>"You know what I mean. We just needed time," we said.</p> <p>"It sounds different. I have never done anything like that before," she said. "It is really weird. I feel so vulnerable with someone. There is no way I can make all this up to you. I really need to start being myself though," she said.</p> <p>"I'm ready to help," I said. "I need to be there with you. I just hope it will work out for us both."</p> <p>"You have nothing to worry about," she said, giving me an intense look as she took my face in her hands and brushed my cheek. "We just need to work on building a stronger friendship. There is nothing wrong with it or any harm I have made." Then she hugged me a little tighter, squeezing my face with her hands as she pulled me against her.</p> <p>We both drifted off, just basking in each others touch. It felt so natural. My body felt heavy and I felt so connected to her. Even that wasn't enough for her. She continued to hold me as we drifted off to sleep holding me. I knew something had happened that day. I felt like a little boy being chased by his best friend in the rain and I had to admit that was a beautiful feeling.</p> <p>In light of what had happened, I felt so secure and protected without her in the arms of my dreams. I could still smell her sweet perfume and feel her warm body. I felt so vulnerable and cared for on this day. The only thing I was worried about right now was if she would be in my bed as I slept. After the morning's intense lovemaking, we both drifted to sleep in this one place.</p> <p>**********</p> <p>A week passed by and I slept fitfully. I was exhausted and wanted to get up and have some food. Finally just as if it was my own fault, I awoke to a knock at the door. I got up and walked to the door. It was her, on her phone.</p> <p>"Hello," I said.</p> <p>"Hi, what's up?" she said, smiling.</p> <p>"Can I come in?" I said.</p> <p>"Of course," she replied. "You can come in."</p> <p>"Ok," I said and slowly got out of bed.
