"What are you doing?"</p> <p>"Don't say anything," she giggled, "Just come take some cold showers with us."</p> <p>"We're your guests," I called back. "Go and get changed. I think you'll enjoy this."</p> <p>"You heard."</p> <p>She ran upstairs to change, leaving her boyfriend Pete with me, who was in his room, and we took off for the showers.</p> <p>"You okay Baby?", I asked her as we were both naked, watching her walk up to the mirror.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm fine," she replied as she wrapped herself up in the fluffy bathrobe.</p> <p>"Hey, I'm watching you, too."</p> <p>"Yeah," she whispered back to me, "And don't you dare say anything."</p> <p>She sat down on the toilet seat and we took pictures as we were both taking pictures in various locations: on my shoulder and on the mirror, of me doing topless on the walk to the car, when I was on a back seat with her dad, taking photos of his smiling at me while we were walking in front of it, a few of me on my knees, kneeling next to the driver's seat.</p> <p>"Where do you want me to go?" she asked me in the mirror, her voice quivering as she diddled with her finger over her lips with her finger just inches away from my pussy.</p> <p>"I want to just touch it...just touch it with my fingers."</p> <p>"Mmmhmm" she said, as she rubbed two fingers over her slick, glistening lips. It was so erotic to think that she'd found my pussy moist and ready, just by touching it.</p> <p>"I just want you to tell me when you're ready to have your finger inside me."</p> <p>"I'm right there, Baby."</p> <p>I took one picture of myself in a standing mirror, and put it onto the TV, then turned around and put my own fingers around her as it was.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, her voice husky and slightly hoarse, "Tell me!"</p> <p>"I want you to tell me when you're ready to have your finger inside me."</p> <p>"Are you sure..." she gasped. I just looked at her, holding her fingers in position so we would both enjoy how she rubbed them over her clit as we looked at each other's face, seeing the effect on her.</p> <p>"Mmmhmm..." I responded and then took a picture.</p> <p>"You want me to put my finger into you...?" she said in a whisper. "You just want me to put a finger inside me."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I whispered back, "I want your finger inside me. Put your finger in me, Baby. Stick your finger into my pussy."</p> <p>"Can I, um...?" she asked as she moved around and knelt a little closer to me.</p> <p>"If you wanna, you can, Sweetie." I whispered back. Her hand moved towards mine and she moved my hand down to where her fingers were.</p> <p>"You can kiss me, Baby," she said, pulling us closer and sliding mine towards her.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I agreed, feeling her lips kissing me at the junction between her fingers and our mouths. "You can kiss my...my mouth."</p> <p>"I want you, Baby," she said as she started to lower her mouth to mine. "Can I kiss your lips?"</p> <p>"Yeah, Baby."</p> <p>"Can you kiss my tongue?"</p> <p>"Can you kiss my throat?" I asked her as she lowered to her elbows and pulled my body towards hers.</p> <p>"Just kiss me there, Baby," I whispered. "Kiss my lips."</p> <p>"Mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
