The sound of a familiar sigh filled her ears. It felt like the walls of an ocean in my body, as I slid slowly in and out of her.</p> <p>My fingers stroked her shoulders again, making her eyes roll in a bit. She had not noticed anything different. My cock slid out, leaving her with a sigh. She moaned slightly.</p> <p>My hands traveled down her back, feeling her lean and arch under me.</p> <p>"Aaah, damn, that's so good" I moaned as she wrapped her hands around my head, pulling my mouth to hers for a big, long French kiss. My cock pressed back into her as our bodies pressed together.</p> <p>I reached around and slid the straps of Brittany's swimsuit off her hands, letting them fall to the sand. We turned. She looked at me in the eye, "I want you to fuck me hard."</p> <p>I smiled at her and moved my body toward her, sliding my arms around her again and holding her close to mine. I was now on all fours, with her on top. I could feel her breasts pressing into my body.</p> <p>Her hips started to move while I pulled her toward me, and I pulled her up so that we could kiss. She moaned in my mouth as I moved between her legs, lifting them up so I could lay them open. She spread them wide. I positioned my cock at the opening to her.</p> <p>I started to lower my hips and let the tip of my cock slide into her. Her hand grabbed the headboard, and I paused there. I felt her body tense and she looked at me, biting her lip. "It will hurt a bit but not a lot." I smiled up at her.</p> <p>We kissed tenderly. I took her wrist in my hand, and guided her hand toward herself while I started to slowly work my cock into her. Little by little she got used to the invasion, and started to groan. I had to steady myself, keeping on the left side of her pussy and pulling her body against me. Her face showed the signs of excitement, eyes half shut, mouth slightly open, her arms tight around me. I started to slowly pull back and then thrust forward into her as her hands tried to keep me out of her.</p> <p>I did so a few times, slowly working my cock back and forth in her warm, tight channel. She had let go of the headboard, and she was rocking her hips against mine. I started to increase the pace, fucking her with long slow strokes that didn't seem to break the dam within us. I could feel her body moving under mine.</p> <p>I watched her eyes when we were in the pool.</p> <p>Her eyes closed, and she started to moan loudly. "Harder, yes, yes, fuck me harder, fuck me like a whore, fuck me hard and make me cum."</p> <p>I gave her what she wanted and she went wild. She tried to lift her legs together but couldn't manage it. I started to buck faster. One of her hands had a death grip on the headboard, and her fingers dug into it. She was bucking against me. I could feel her clit rubbing my cock, and I knew she was going to cum. "Oh yeah, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!"</p> <p>"Oh, oh, oh," I thought to myself, trying to hold on while she climaxed.</p> <p>Suddenly she stopped what she was doing, and let the orgasm roll over her. Her body went stiff, her arms and legs quivering as her cum began to flow. It started in my legs as she moved from side to side. Her breath stopped. Her legs started to weaken.</p> <p>I held her tight, letting her orgasm wash over her. I didn't want to lose any of my momentum. My cock was still inside her as my cock jerked spurt after shot into her. She fell against me, panting.</p> <p>"Well, aren't you the hunk!" Brittany laughed.</p> <p>We both laughed. Then she leaned into me, and whispered, "My boyfriend had a point, not me."</p> <p>I said, "I'm always ready, but I don't know how else I can do it."</p> <p>A look of confusion crossed Brittany's face and she quickly added, "I never asked for your big thing."</p> <p>We kissed again, and after a bit of kissing I asked if she was comfortable with me.</p> <p>She smiled, and said with a grin, "Yeah, I was always ready."</p> <p>I held her as if to reassure her, and said "Well, if you're not comfortable with it, I'll understand."</p> <p>I held her to me as we kissed again.
