"Please take me. Please make love to me."</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," he said as he reached around her and untied the knot holding her robe around her waist. With one finger, he slid a strand of the soft, brown hair off her upper thigh, up over her mound onto her hip and across her stomach. Holding the robe closed tightly, he leaned in close to kiss her.</p> <p>Josie was breathless and he felt her arms go around him. He looked down to see the tiny pink triangle of hair under her panties between her thighs and his heart lurched in his chest at the thought of the soft, wet lips and he lowered his hands, palms flat on her chest. His hands moved to the bottom of her breasts, kneading the soft skin gently with two fingers. He cupped her breasts and kissed her again. After a few seconds, he dropped his hands back down her body and cupped her mound through the panties. As though in a trance, she moaned as he rubbed her through the material. The silk fell to the floor where shoes and socks lay.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p> <p>No answer was needed. He pressed his body against hers and lifted her up onto the bed. She was naked in his arms and as he lifted her legs, she spread them inviting them closer. He bent his head and began to kiss, lightly at first and then more deeply. She responded, pressing her pelvis closer to him, moaning as the first small electric shock of his tongue on her clit sent a jolt up and down her body. Her body was hot and slippery and he licked hard and fast as though he could never get enough of her taste. She squirmed under him and felt her nipples harden. She leaned her head against his shoulder and moaned her delight in his mouth as he drove two fingers inside her, thrusting them in and out as he sucked a nipple between his lips...</p> <p>He was in lust with the beauty he was tasting. No woman was capable of such a response. His mind was filled with images of the soft pink folds and soft inner surfaces hidden between her thighs. The lips were swollen and inviting, the pussy lips moist and wet. He wanted to kiss her pussy, but knew if he entered her that would be only for a short while as she lay there panting and moaning under his talented tongue. His hands left her breasts and moved to her ass. He pressed her back against his hardness, rubbing the tip against the wet lips of her pussy. Then, he pressed his hips forward and plunged his cock into her, filling her. She cried out as he began to thrust in and out and her hips met his with a series of spasms.</p> <p>She was almost oblivious to everything else in the room as her whole being was on fire and all that existed at this moment was his hard cock in her pussy, the soft flesh and wet flesh of her inner thighs, his mouth on her nipples and her breath coming quicker as his body moved in and out of her. His tongue was wild as he flicked and tormented them and their moans became louder and stronger until with an almighty groan, he thrust his whole body into her and came.</p> <p>In their frenzy, neither of them noticed the bed creak slightly as he lifted her and they kissed hard and deep as their bodies came back to Earth. It was not a passionate kissing, but was not lost on either of them. But it was tender and meaningful, the closeness of two deeply intimate people who needed to touch and to be touched. She did not feel betrayed, but knew he could not. He held her in his arms and kissed her eyes and cheek and neck and chest.</p> <p>When his breath was coming back to him, Josie reached down and grasped his soft cock. "I wanted to do it again," she whispered. "But you're not finished," she said as she slipped his cock into her mouth again.</p> <p>"I'll give you a moment," he said, rising, kissing her forehead and stroking her hair. "After you do me a favor." He moved slightly back with her and sat on the armchair. "Lie down," he said.</p> <p>Josie looked up in surprise to see him sitting there, his knees wide apart and a smile on his face.</p> <p>"Come," he said as he stood up and reached a hand behind her head. "Lie back and let me lick you for a couple of hours."</p> <p>He moved away, then turned to face Josie. With a knowing smile he reached his hand under her and pulled her towards him, moving her legs apart and up until he could rub the tip of his cock on her clit. "Mmm," she said with a sigh, "that feels nice!"</p> <p>He watched in a mix of awe and fascination as she stretched herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
