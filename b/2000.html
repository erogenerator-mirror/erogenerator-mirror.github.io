We know you love him."</p> <p>I looked around. I felt a pang of fear at being alone in the world. Then...</p> <p>"It's ok... if you're ready, I'm free."</p> <p>I felt something strange against the back of my neck, then I heard his voice again. The voice of a man. The man that saved me from myself.</p> <p>"Now... you have a choice... you can either be my girlfriend, and let me finish what I started... or you can go home and let me finish what I started."</p> <p>My heart pounded.</p> <p>"Amber, sweetie, don't even think about backing out. I can't have your father hurt by his own sister!"</p> <p>Amber looked at me for a long time. I couldn't tell what the big man was thinking, so I just went with it.</p> <p>"He's right. You're wrong! I can't! It's not fair! The consequences of what I've done, and all my heart is hurt! Now that I think about you right now right this moment, I know I'm better off for both of us, than I'm afraid to admit that. This moment makes me so, so stupid. But... if he really loves me, and is as devoted to me as I love him, then I don't think he's made any decisions for me... not my own. It's like some crazy game in there that should be over, or at least made, right? You're wrong, Amber. You're a stupid, stupid girl!"</p> <p>Amber burst into tears.</p> <p>"No... no... Please... no, I'll do it! It's not even a one-time thing... you're right! Please... let me go!"</p> <p>"No. Baby, there's no way that you can make your decision until you really love me. You know you love me. You know you want to marry me for you... or... or maybe even for me!"</p> <p>"Wait... that's not nice!"</p> <p>Amber's hands fell to her cheeks and she didn't look at me with tears in her eyes. She just stared at the ground, and I felt myself turning to run. When I reached the door, I took a second to look around. There was nobody there. My friend was just sitting on the living room rug, looking down at the floor. I took another step into the hallway, trying desperately to look her in the face.</p> <p>"Baby, listen to me! If you really feel you hate me anymore, just listen and tell me! Tell me you love me! Tell me you love me!" I said through gritted teeth.</p> <p>Amber looked me up and down, then suddenly stood up and turned to face me.</p> <p>"Baby, don't worry. I love you. You don't have to talk to me about this."</p> <p>I held my breath. The words were going to be very strange, and I knew I could never be able to say them. But, then again, that part of Amber made them sound amazing.</p> <p>"Alright... listen to me. So. I don't hate you for... you know... you and dad. But. I don't know... what we'll be like after I divorce. And I'm afraid it'll hurt you. I wish I could say that."</p> <p>"Then... I'll stay with you, okay?"</p> <p>Amber held me close as I walked past her mother's. When I got to my father's door, he was leaning against the doorframe, looking out.</p> <p>"Dad! Dad! Are you there?" His voice was like a lullaby, and he had gotten in the car with his son and was talking on the phone to mom.</p> <p>I walked over and took Eric's keys back. He looked as if he was just waking up from the fog.</p> <p>"Dad... I want to go talk to Amber."</p> <p>"Why aren't you around now?"</p> <p>"Because, she's gone. Dad, I've got it."</p> <p>Eric turned over his cellphone and listened for a second.</p> <p>"I don't want to be around you when she's gone."</p> <p>Eric turned over on his feet. I was a little disappointed.</p> <p>"Dad..." He looked at me. "Amber and I have one of those fights... I don't want to break it up. I don't care if she's got kids... I love her."</p> <p>"Then why aren't you around when she's gone?"</p> <p>"I don't know." He looked down for a long time, then looked up again. "I know. I... I guess I need to just give her a little push to get used to."</p> <p>Suddenly, Amber came out of the bedroom, looking scared.
