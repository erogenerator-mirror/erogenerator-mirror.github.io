It's the least I can do for him... well, not just to keep him happy, I thought I'd give him the benefit of these three and make him see that the sex thing is done and done."</p> <p>"Well, then, perhaps we can take a stand and get back at the situation that he found himself stuck with."</p> <p>Bev took the camera off the tripod and motioned for Mike to hold it up and took a close-up of her face as it was taken. He was surprised, and pleased and flattered, to be asked and to ask again and then agree. He asked again and again and again. Mike's only answer was with 'Yes' and 'No'. He thought 'What the hell, I'll do it'.</p> <p>Bev pulled the camera off and brought it up to her face again. "I don't think the camera is going to go off, Mike," she said. "I really don't think a little video camera will go off any time soon. Do you think you could do that for me? Just a little filming of course."</p> <p>"Yeah, let's think about that," Mike said. "How about you, do you think you'd do this? Could you do that and not just do it?"</p> <p>Bev went for the kill, "Oh, I don't know, Mike. I suppose you could, but I doubt it, not even in the beginning."</p> <p>"Okay," Mike said. "Let's think about it then. If you're sure, I'd really like to come here."</p> <p>Mike was pleased again. "You'll need to come over here and have a look at how you would get the job. I think I'll put the camera somewhere else anyway, would you mind."</p> <p>"No, I think it's only fair that you should do it. Why the thought of you saying 'no', Mike?" asked Bev.</p> <p>"I don't know! I thought I'd never see you again, Bev!"</p> <p>"Oh, it's okay, Mike. It's still a job," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"Well, if you want it to be, that will be my pleasure," Mike said, putting the camera back on the stand. "And we can get back to what I was doing at the mall. It's a very interesting experience to watch, to be sure."</p> <p>Mike, with his hands in his pockets, "Well, I guess that will be a bit of a step for me. Here, take my jacket and we'll start on the next step. Here's your camera, Bev, give me your hand, okay? I'll call you next week, okay?"</p> <p>Mike had forgotten that Bev had said 'okay'. Now there was one more step. He took Bev's left hand slowly and brought it to his face and looked at her. "Here you go, Mike," he said as he brought up his own free hand with his right hand. "Here you go."</p> <p>As Bev looked at the camera, Mike put the camera back on the stand and started walking toward the garage door.</p> <p>Bev took the chance to get hold of the door handle and push it open just a crack, then turned off the lights and went to the garage.</p> <p>When Mike opened the door and went into the kitchen, he stopped, looking at Bev closely. "Bev, will I see you here at work?"</p> <p>"Oh, you know what to do," she said, smiling broadly. "Come here when I get done with this."</p> <p>While Mike was talking to Bev, I had taken my own jacket off and joined her at the sink, taking my shoes off and putting them into the washer. Now I was ready to get down to making coffee.</p> <p>Bev got her coffee going - a hot, hot cup with a hint of orange - and walked over to Mike. Mike took his hand and put it under Bev's chin for just a second and pulled her close to him. His lips touched hers lightly, just gently and then turned them to kiss her a long, wet kiss.</p> <p>"I like it this way Mike!" Bev said as she ran her hand up his side and held his face softly. "I like it even better with your lips."</p> <p>Mike's kiss deepened, with Bev's tongue pushing it against his own. The kiss was so deeply and sensuous that Mike felt his hard cock pressing against his shorts. He pulled back for a minute and said, "But we don't have time, if you know what I mean. I want to do something right now."</p> <p>Bevâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
