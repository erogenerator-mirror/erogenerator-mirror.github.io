They are almost like a French roll and they are silky to your touch.</p> <p>"Thank you," you say, walking over. I sit in a chair. You sit down in a chair facing me.</p> <p>"So, is that this a wedding," you say, a bit confused.</p> <p>"Yes, no, no, you do realize that are are just two formalities. You will see, we are married and we are both people of whom you will enjoy more than I can say."</p> <p>"I don't know what you are talking about," you say, as you stand, unbuttoning your dress.</p> <p>"My point is your dress needs to be removed, so you can reveal your body," I state. I reach inside the dress, slowly pulling it off over your head.</p> <p>"God you are good at that," you say, as I stand, leaving the panties on you. I walk over and kiss your neck, feeling your pulse go up my arm as you shiver. Your nipples harden at the touch of the dress against them.</p> <p>"You are gorgeous when you show them off," I say, before I kiss you softly on the lips. Our tongues entwine for a few moments. I step back, and remove my panties before stepping back and turning around.</p> <p>I feel you shift in your chair, and you close your eyes as I run my hands over my body. I turn and sit in the chair.</p> <p>"That felt so good," I say, moving my hands to my breasts, feeling them and rubbing them as yours do. I slide a finger into my bellybutton for you. I moan softly.</p> <p>"Your legs feel beautiful," you say, your eyes looking down at me.</p> <p>"It's nice to know that I have nice legs," I reply, knowing from looking at you that I have beautiful legs.</p> <p>"They look delicious on you," you say, looking up at me again.</p> <p>I get up and walk toward you. I unzip my dress, laying it on your desk, and drop it on the floor. I stand in front of you. My panties are in evidence and are in view. I have been sopping from my own arousal just at that moment. I kneel down in front of you, slowly caressing you. I move my hands up slowly, making sure I don't forget the buttons. I undo them gently.</p> <p>You are breathing heavily as I run my hands down your body. I run them lightly over your stomach, your shoulders, and then reach your breasts. I caress them softly. I run my fingers over a nipple, lightly rolling it. Your gasp when my fingers run a finger up your belly. Your skin is so soft. I take a finger and run it down your body, along your lips, and to your clit. You moan.</p> <p>I remove my finger from your clit, and I run it over the opening of your pussy. You moan again. I spread your legs farther apart, and slide a finger into you. You are so wet. I can feel the heat and tightness of your pussy lips on my finger.</p> <p>I slowly and gently push myself in a few inches. Your hips jerk, as if you were trying to sit on my finger.</p> <p>I take my finger out of you, and I can feel the wetness I made on your lips. The juices are running down my fingers and into my hand. One of your hands is rubbing against your tits, while the other is holding my face and kissing me hard.</p> <p>I stand up, and pull myself away. I am not completely sure what does to you. I watch you, lying on your back. You look up at me then move your eyes up to me.</p> <p>"What's wrong," I say, as I run my finger lightly against your lips. You open them. I stick one finger in, just to start. You suck my finger greedily. You moan at the feel of me in your mouth. I pull my finger from your mouth. I run my tongue around it, sucking you with my hot mouth on your pussy.</p> <p>I slide my finger back in, feeling the wetness as I move it in and out. The feel of your hot juice on my finger is making me want you more and more.</p> <p>I slide itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
