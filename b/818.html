I'd never been that fascinated with the way I liked to look at it. I liked it more than I liked anything else - particularly when it wasn't as large as it should have been. I'd also never seen breasts that large on a man. They were always topped by very prominent areolas and nipples that looked like they were permanently erect. I guess it was what happened with my friends in high school, when you got to know each other. There'd be plenty of guys and lots of girls. I'd never thought this one would be my cup of tea. My breasts were so big and it was always hard for me to get any support on them. I suppose I was still an attractive guy when it was so good for me to be as good as I wanted to be. But then I came out to class in the worst way, when I could see what most had thought was just about right in front of me. For lack of better, I'd seen what they did in class - girls were staring at my boobs. Some had even said aloud: "Holy shit." But I always thought that it was just a woman's breasts that could draw the most attention if you gave them a few seconds of attention.</p> <p>I was trying to think of a way to find out if it was the breasts or my penis or something else. But I always had to admit that there shouldn't be any reason not to be completely honest with myself. So I'd just told the girl I could see, "I must have some big boobs. It's hard for me to hide them well." If it was a girl, how could she possibly think I'd be embarrassed? But the guy, the one in front of me who I couldn't take my eyes off - well, he was very nice. I'd even told him to put on a better look at her cleavage if he could. I know that sounds terrible, but I'd told him to leave a compliment on my cleavage, just so he could see what a body it made. It was just embarrassing that I used those words. I never thought that they would do the trick. They just sort of reminded me why I felt that way.</p> <p>"I see, but your tits seem to fit that body." I'd told her, which was the truth - I always considered my boobs much too large a description of myself, and I'd had to spend a lot of time trying to tell girls I could fit into their chests better. The way I felt about the difference between breasts and bodies made me feel really guilty. But I'd had a pretty intense sexual experience with a girl that I'd barely even known for a moment, before she'd taken me in her arms, kissed me, rubbed my bare breasts against hers and just kept pushing me away until I had kissed her back with her breasts pressed to mine. But then she'd pulled me back into her embrace. I knew I'd never kiss those lips good either, but those were the only things I'd liked better.</p> <p>I guess I'm an attractive guy. I'm six feet and lean, which makes me an absolute nerd. But not the sort that everyone seems to think that they have to be attractive so they can look at the things that really mean anything in life. But I'm a fairly average guy. I'm average in many other respects, and I'm a guy who doesn't have any real flaws in him. I'm not going to say that I'm an ugly guy, not at all. I get that that way a lot. I don't necessarily have to look bad.</p> <p>We had had a lot of good times together, and I knew she always enjoyed having me around. She was always talking about me like I was some sort of hero. She'd run up her legs, and then I would run up hers - sometimes even up onto her breasts - and squeeze them in my hands. At the dinner table a couple of times, my hands would go under the bottom of her sweater, which she'd pulled up so I could run my fingers through her bra. I remember that moment vividly. I felt that softness of her skin underneath my fingers in that moment. Just as her hand made a slight downward turn as my fingers touched the lace of her bra, the other hand came down, and the one under the sweater started to slide her bra up her arms. I thought the idea was pretty sick to see, but it wasn't at all. I had to put up with that a lot.</p> <p>We had gone through a lot for the first three months. I'd had a lot of time to think about the events of the previous evening, and I just felt that I needed to start again. The first question was how she'd take to seeing me naked. I certainly saw her standing up to her date from the table, and I couldn't imagine walking across the room or evenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
