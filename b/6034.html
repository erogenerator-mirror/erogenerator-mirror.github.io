"I can feel you cumming on my cock, my fucking prick, your pussy."</p> <p>"Yeah! Oh God! Fuck my cunt! God! Fuck my pussy!"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!"</p> <p>"Do you want to cum inside of me, you slut? Oh, yeah, cum in my pussy again, cum!"</p> <p>"Yes!" She kept yelling, her body quivering as she exploded in the throes of orgasm. "I'm cumming, I'm cumming!"</p> <p>"I'm gonna fucking cum!" I growled, reaching my own orgasm, and it hit me like a freight train, pumping ropes of sperm into the depths of her pussy. She screamed out even louder, as each powerful jet of my hot sperm filled her pussy to the brim. When I finished she collapsed onto me, her body trembling and quivering like a wild woman.</p> <p>"That was fucking amazing!" I said, finally getting my breath back after that intense orgasm. We lay there for a few minutes, our sweaty chests pressed together.</p> <p>"That was the best fuckin' orgasm I ever had in my life, wasn't it?" She asked, looking at me with those gorgeous blue eyes.</p> <p>"Uh huh," I grinned, getting up. "Let's get cleaned up."</p> <p>We took a quick shower and got dressed, then spent some time in the kitchen making a big breakfast, where we had a couple of drinks and a couple of glasses of wine, in separate containers. When we had finished and had cleaned up a bit, I went out to hang the bags. I went up to see a couple of guys who I had thought were her lovers.</p> <p>"Oh, you guys have guests coming over for brunch," She called from her living room. "They'll love to be here. We were expecting two, so they can keep them for a couple of hours, so they can enjoy themselves. They're here right now."</p> <p>"We sure want to take them, don't we, honey?" I replied, handing the bag over to my brother.</p> <p>"Yeah, we were planning on it."</p> <p>"OK. Let's go. We don't want them to go, we have to get them something, a hot shower and then we can come down and see what we can do."</p> <p>"Yeah, we can be there in about fifteen minutes." I replied. I grabbed the bag of toys and set it aside for later.</p> <p>"Well, maybe you're right. Maybe we better head over."</p> <p>We set the bags down on the counter, then grabbed our robes and headed downstairs where most of the breakfast was packed. I poured a few glasses of wine, and we ate.</p> <p>"Looks like someone wants to take advantage of the free room in the guest bathroom, but we're not going to charge them in case they break out," I said, grinning at her.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"It's kind of a gift, and they'll enjoy it. If they break out after the food is done, they'll just leave their stuff."</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"Oh. I know, I know. And you should really think before you ask. After the food is consumed, some of those things they may throw on to play with, I can always use these toys before the sex."</p> <p>I poured a glass of wine, and got us some glasses. "So, what do you think of the idea?" I asked her. I had no idea the idea was going to work, but I had to tell her what I thought it would.</p> <p>"It's great!" She said. "But how will I know if they won't break out and walk in on us? No, I think people might just turn and leave and I might get turned on."</p> <p>"So you don't think that's a good idea?"</p> <p>"No, no. But I wouldn't be surprised if they did break their pants and show their stuff to others that would likely have them."</p> <p>"Well, you're right. That might make things a little easier if they do break free and run off."</p> <p>"I agree, you stud, I agree, you should do that. We are going to have guests."</p> <p>"Maybe I'll just go along with it, but maybe I won't."</p> <p>We finished our food and the dishes, putting the stuff away with the other bags. As we were heading to the guest bathroom, she asked, "So, just what is it that you see in the front, and whereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
