I love every second of that. Maybe if I do it a second time I'll be able to take the cum out of you soon," I replied.</p> <p>After a minute of lying on my back with the door leading out into the cool night air, Kate started to pull my legs together. Instead of putting them together she pulled them apart, opened them, and pushed one of them completely underneath me and started to kiss the inside of my ass cheek while one of her arms was wrapped around my thigh and one of her fingers was rubbing the top of my pussy.</p> <p>Not too far down and a little bit higher. And then it was a slow progression to kiss my ass in a more urgent way. I loved it. I knew that if I wasn't lying there with my legs parted as high as possible with my pussy spread and lips open with all of the air surrounding my body I'll be able to feel the texture and shape of what I'm feeling. I don't know about the other women, but I've just never felt the passion in another woman.</p> <p>It made all the difference, especially if it meant the same thing to me.</p> <p>Finally, Kate lowered her head and started to kiss the inside of my thighs. It sent shivers through me. The feeling of her mouth kissing my legs while her long fingers were still rubbing my pussy was just unbelievable. It felt so warm, and soft and all right. She was such a natural blonde!</p> <p>For what felt like 20 minutes, she licked my thighs and pussy. Slowly at first and then more quickly. I tried to encourage her to go further, but it took a while. Finally she came close to my cunt, kissed the inside of it, kissed it gently, then she started again with a lick as she had on my inner thigh. This way I felt the texture and shape of her tongue from different places, while she played gently with my clit with her long fingers, one after another. She sucked on my pussy in a sort of tongue bath.</p> <p>"Oh, I love sucking your pussy. It feels so good. I can't believe how excited I get by it. I feel like I'm a girl," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, you're a girl. Are you excited? If so, I can wait for a little while longer."</p> <p>Kate pulled me up to her and sat me on the edge of the bed. As she held my skirt right up (with my thong on, of course!) she lifted one leg, leaned back and brought it up towards my chest. I don't know how long she was letting me sit there like that, but I'm sure she had more plans for me. She opened my legs further and pulled the skirt up so that it was on top. I was looking at Kate's pussy in her white bikini, trimmed and trimmed, looking like one of her dolls. It was neat and pink, the lips closed together tightly so as not to hurt my fingers, her outer lips were already puffed up. It looked really different than other girls' pussies, though I'm not sure if I've ever looked it that way before.</p> <p>I could feel my pussy getting moist and slippery even though my inner lips were still partially open. I could imagine being held like this by Kate, kissing and touching her all over. But I wanted this too. I wanted to feel more of it.</p> <p>Kate reached over and slowly caressed and stroked me, occasionally taking a fingernail right along the crease of my little pink pucker. I was breathing hard as she did this and felt even more excited, as if she could feel how aroused I might be getting. My clit throbbed and she just held it and rubbed it. Then she put her finger just inside and began to move it up and down, feeling for my opening. It felt so good, so soft, and I began to breathe harder as her finger slid in and out just like a man's cock. I could feel her palm pressing down a little and knew she was starting to rub my clit too.</p> <p>Then she took her middle finger and gently rubbed the outside of my asshole. And then the fingertip pressed back into my ass and I felt the same feeling the finger had earlier. With each push, her finger opened me and got easier as it went in. I felt like I was taking all kinds of feelings inside there. I couldn't believe it!</p> <p>"Okay," I gasped. "That's right – go deeper, faster, just move it around and get a little bit deeper when it's right in, I want to feel that all the way into me. You don't need to do this anymore."</p> <p>Kate said, "I'm not going to stop now. I want to feel it all the way up me this time. I'm just glad that I have some time—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
