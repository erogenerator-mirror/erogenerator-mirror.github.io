I'm glad she had a chance to recover."</p> <p>When the waiter saw the four of them, Mike gave Sarah a hard stare, while the woman, a brunette with large breasts and long, straight hair said, "I'd better have a beer, then."</p> <p>"I have some wine," Mike offered. "The wine is ready. Do you want anything else?"</p> <p>The woman turned to see everyone else standing there, so she said, "I'm Sarah, but everyone knows me as Katie," and pointed to Mike and Sarah who looked to be in their mid-20's, then the man at their table said, "My wife is Katie and Katie is the bride! Why, don't you two sit back down. The table doesn't need anything else tonight."</p> <p>As Sarah got up and moved to sit down, Tom said out of nowhere, "Hey! You're not even 18 anymore! You can't go dancing!"</p> <p>Mike reached out and picked up her hand, saying, "No, I can't, I'm not going to dance!" His eyes were wide. "But of course she can," Sarah whispered to him as she smiled and nodded her head at the waiter. When he went to bring their drinks, Mike said, "I have to pay for them. But I'm sure I can find something to wear so there won't be a problem here."</p> <p>The waiter had returned with their drinks. We were all watching the table as he pulled the chair to Sarah who was seated in the chair with her legs apart and one leg out and then her hips to give Mike an unobstructed view of her panties.</p> <p>Then he turned his attention to the table. "I'll be back in a minute."</p> <p>Sarah giggled and said, "You guys, make yourselves comfortable." She turned to Mike, "I've had a great evening."</p> <p>He smiled and said, "Just one more minute. I think the ladies would be more comfortable if I left for a while."</p> <p>The waiter returned and set the champagne glasses on the table.</p> <p>Sarah looked over her shoulder at Mike and said, "That man is insufferable!"</p> <p>Mike looked at her with a smile and said, "It's true what he's told you about being on the verge of losing your virginity tonight. But I suppose it's your turn for one minute."</p> <p>While he stood up his eyes were fixed on the open crotch of his wife and the man sitting close to them as they talked to each other.</p> <p>The waiter returned with the champagne glasses and filled them up with the wine, which Mike and Sarah handed him. He then walked around the table and handed Sarah her glass as he said, "So I see you got a lot of talking to happen tonight."</p> <p>It was then that Sarah said, "I don't usually have so much alcohol tonight."</p> <p>Tom was looking at Sarah's skirt now, probably her white silk panties. "Well, what have you got hidden under there?"</p> <p>Mike smiled and said, "You know, I have a couple of very interesting things to tell you tomorrow too."</p> <p>The silence in the place was deafening as Tom continued, "But for now, let's have more champagne!"</p> <p>As the group sat down to their Champagne and their wine, a moment of silence was broken when Sarah spoke up, "My friend Katie and I are going to go have some fun with the rest of the couples tonight. And I told her that she looked fantastic in that dress that I saw you in a few minutes ago."</p> <p>Tom's face turned a bright red and his eyebrows went up as they all took a sip of their champagne.</p> <p>A moment later Kate spoke up saying, "Sarah told me that you had a great evening last night."</p> <p>Sarah said, "Yeah, I did. I told her the right thing to do."</p> <p>"And did you, Mike?" Sarah gave Mike a big smile and a wink.</p> <p>Mike nodded and said, "Yeah, we all did."</p> <p>Kate chuckled and said, "Well, Sarah and I are going to be doing something together tonight tonight. What should we do?"</p> <p>Tom said, "Well, if you don't want my wife to go out with her own husband while we have all her clothing, I'll go with someone like you."</p> <p>Sarah laughed and said, "No Mike. If I'm going to be alone with a man and have an undressing session with him I want Sarah to be alone with him for as long as we say. So we can watch TV, talk with the girls, and drink wine, then go out to dinner and...and...and...andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
