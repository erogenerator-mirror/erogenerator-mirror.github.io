I am not going to wait to grab my suitcase, just get my keys out, and follow your mother's directions through the little airport, and get a cab so I can go home with you. But don't forget to have a couple condoms in case and catch some flight back to the states with you. You won't regret it."</p> <p>"But Mom...."</p> <p>"Not another word."</p> <p>"But I did not mean...."</p> <p>"Shut up."</p> <p>She kissed me passionately again, as she pulled me close, and the first thing that my mind seemed to focus on was the fact that she was my Mom. Now, she had to remember that in her youth they had been more than just friends—they had been lovers. But now that I held her at that moment and knew her naked body, with our mouths, my hands and my eyes were all on a woman. As I felt her body against mine, I felt an overpowering desire to do so with her. I had wanted to have sex with her for longer than I thought, and had no idea what I should do. My cock wanted it too, and the fact that she was my Mom was a beautiful thing to behold. It began to grow, too, as I felt it swell. It began to throb. I pulled her toward me and brought my lips to her ear. I heard her sigh and heard her voice. I felt her hands on my ass and she began to caress my cheeks. The only thing was my growing cock. This was something I had dreamt of for years. It had been going so long that it hurt, I had never felt it move. I tried to reach down with my hand around her, but was met in a slap down, which quickly went away, but it was there again, and again. I tried to push her away, and feel her hands on me, but again and again I managed to just push her back to the floor, and my cock had now grown beyond what it had been when she had been the babysitter.</p> <p>"It's okay now. It's just like old times."</p> <p>"Yes it is."</p> <p>"I mean yes it is."</p> <p>"Are you ready for some of sex, Sweet, or are you just going to sit there and stare into each others eyes, hoping for some relief from that terrible ache you have?"</p> <p>"Yes....yes I'm ready for sex."</p> <p>"Good girl."</p> <p>She smiled, and kissed me again, with a sense of motherly gentleness I had never felt before. She held me as we laid there quietly enjoying each others touch and warmth. But it was her breasts that began to get all tingly and her body reacted with a sudden twitch in my hips. I had not intended to move, and she had not, and this one was my Mother. She began to rub her nipples into my chest and my cock as I moved in her, pressing our pubic bones together. Her breath was hot on my neck, and then her lips were upon me, and she pulled me toward her, and she ground her crotch into mine as I slid her thong to our feet. I could not help myself—I felt my cock growing hard, and as I did. We rolled over and I slid into her and she rose up to meet me with one of her own as I began to move my pelvis against hers. "Hmmmm......yes......this is soooooooo new" she purred. "Do you like it? Do you like my body, Baby?"</p> <p>"Oh yes", was all I could manage. Her eyes were like flames, her tits nearly on fire, and her legs were pulling me in, holding me deeply within her. My body began to move slowly, in almost languid, and I felt a warm wave of pleasure begin to gather with each stroke. When she began to move in circles with me, and began to press back against me, my hips were rolling so that we were all moving. I knew where we were at, between us, with my throbbing manhood deep within her, and her. I felt her body rising and sinking to meet me, matching each thrust, pushing me in a different direction, moving her on the bed, driving me into her. She was moving with me...her body moving faster than I had imagined, and as she began to go higher she went faster with me. I could feel it, her pussy was opening up as she slid onto my cock and was pushing me into her deeper and deeper.
