Like a little whore with a hard-on."</p> <p>"So you want to help me pick out a nice nice dress, or should I just take you over my knee or whatever it's called? I mean, I've been there and done that, but I'm not one hundred percent sure I like it. Let's just get down to business and find out."</p> <p>They both looked around to see if they'd seen a good size pick up and, surprisingly, the store looked just fine. As the assistant walked off, Emily walked over to the small rack of dresses that were open in the back.</p> <p>"I can't find one that fits."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"It's not really for me."</p> <p>"I could use something that's comfortable for just about anything like me. But don't worry. I'm not into rough sex."</p> <p>"You are not. Just try something."</p> <p>"Oh, you have already picked them out, haven't you? You've also got the best pair of tits I've ever ever seen."</p> <p>"Hey, it's not sex. Stop calling me that. Now tell me."</p> <p>"Just put some money in it, and then bring it back."</p> <p>"But what if I don't look the best I can?"</p> <p>"I might let you just go home."</p> <p>"Don't you want to look pretty for someone as nice? You've got that great figure, too."</p> <p>"Well, this isn't a boyfriend. I'd like to spend some time with just her, and not get too carried away."</p> <p>"No, I mean, would you really want to keep seeing her?"</p> <p>"I don't think I can stay with her, even if she is a total slut. But would it really help me find a nice dress?"</p> <p>"Would you stop talking about her and just think about her? I think it would help me and make me feel better."</p> <p>"It might be pretty nice for you if you just think about her, too. You know, for me to look like that. I've never looked like this before, but you do have some great tits and are pretty friendly."</p> <p>"You are a really smart young man," Emily said. "You're probably wondering what it would be like if I just walked into a store that has these things."</p> <p>"Well, that's just what I was going to do. I picked up a couple of dresses, and now it's your turn to check in again. Just bring yours over to me when you're ready."</p> <p>"I'll be right back." And she walked off, looking at herself in the mirror. She pulled on her skirt, and then slid her blouse over her head and put both down on the rack of dresses. She looked over her neck and back at herself, then down at her hands and back up and laughed nervously.</p> <p>Emily was surprised at herself, a girl like her. How was that possible? She'd been on the phone with an agency a couple of days ago, and now here she was talking to a girl like that, looking like the most adorable thing in the world. And, why couldn't she talk to a woman like that? She couldn't be bothered. At least she thought that would be a lie. She looked over at the racks of dresses. She couldn't do it. After a couple of minutes she heard someone walk past. She looked out to see who it was.</p> <p>"Excuse me, but may I help you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She reached for the shoulder strap of the dress. She had never owned a dress up before, but was amazed at the ease with which she had picked out a dress.</p> <p>"It's very, very beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you, but I really need to get back. I've just got someone's idea of the perfect dress up here."</p> <p>"Is she married?"</p> <p>"No. She's with one of her partners."</p> <p>"What are they getting a package? What if I want to see them."</p> <p>"Well, it's an expensive look. They're not going to fit. And I'll be glad you have something that fits with the right size."</p> <p>"Well, maybe I am. It would feel great to wear something nice like that."</p> <p>"I know, you really like it, don't you? And where's the underwear? I mean, you really like what I can do with that."</p> <p>"Are you telling me you'd let me stay with you?
