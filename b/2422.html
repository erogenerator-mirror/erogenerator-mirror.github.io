"I don't like her."</p> <p>And that was all it took.</p> <p>We heard the bedroom door open and close.</p> <p>"I'll just be a moment," we heard the voice in the hallway.</p> <p>I pushed myself up off the bed and got off it. I knew he wanted me to go, but I was afraid of what he'd do if I did.</p> <p>"Go... just... just go!" I turned back, but he was gone.</p> <p>I turned back, this time looking back at my new lover. He was watching me. He was smiling right back. I knew he liked it too much.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go...?" he said, and my heart jumped.</p> <p>"You know what I mean. I can't wait. I'm ready, right?"</p> <p>"Then just wait," he said.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>It took all my self control to not be swept up in the moment, to stop just because I was afraid we'd wake up the wrong girl and I would just be a mess. I just stood there, waiting to be told I needed to hurry up the next step. I just wished he'd hurry up. We walked down the stairs, both of us nervous. We finally got the front door all the way unlocked.</p> <p>"Wait... now!"</p> <p>The front door opened, the hallway was empty, we made it to the steps of our apartment, we walked over to the counter there, it was one of those old appliances we were using sometimes.</p> <p>"I thought you might like to watch the movie," he said as I stepped aside and picked up the remote.</p> <p>"Doofus, what's this?" I said, laughing to myself as I picked up the remote again. I didn't turn it on, but I wanted to be sure I didn't miss a single second of it. I picked my way up the third floor.</p> <p>"The one in the far right corner is where people sleep when they get ready for work."</p> <p>He sat down in his living room to watch the movie. I grabbed his right arm and put him down as he stared out the window. I'd always known he would. Not that I had a problem waking up to it, not that it had been his intention. I could just see those little smiles on his face as he watched the movie we were watching. I turned to head for the door, but stopped as I heard him say something.</p> <p>"You don't get a choice. Just wait until I get done."</p> <p>I waited until the movie was over before turning to him.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for years for this," I said, and pulled him up.</p> <p>My first thought was to get him up and over my knees, but when we got to my bedroom door, I knew from what I saw in the dark that he was naked, but at least I knew that, for him that was not a big deal. He had beautiful large, firm, pale pink-red penis, and I could not decide what to do. But he reached out to me, as I put my hand around his neck and guided him towards me.</p> <p>I slowly opened it as he came up.</p> <p>"It's okay," he said, kissing me with his mouth open and ready.</p> <p>I gave him a long kiss, and pulled him onto the bed, he was hard again. I pulled my panties aside for him, and he pushed himself inside me to start. Once again, his penis touched my walls. I gasped a little as he pressed in, I felt so full after his penis was gone. He kissed me again, his mouth was on my neck. I was moaning as he began to move inside me. I was holding on to him, not wanting to break the spell we were now under. He started to move in and out, moving his penis in and out of my opening as I felt his lips and tongue on me even better as he did.</p> <p>Then I let go. In a second my body was wracked by wave after wave of orgasm. I don't think I've ever experienced it or anything like it. I just couldn't believe I was feeling all good as I was feeling it myself. I couldn't believe how powerful it was to feel this much pleasure from one man.</p> <p>I had never felt so desired as I did now that Mark's penis was within me, I was feeling nothing but pure pleasure, no doubt. I was not at all afraid of doing anything so stupid for my partner.</p> <p>"You... are such a tease, aren't you?" my boyfriend said, his voice laced with lust, no matter what he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
