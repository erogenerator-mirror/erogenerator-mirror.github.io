In my hotel room, it looked like an ordinary shower with a vanity on the side. It looked like some weirdo had had a massive orgy just a week ago. But this was a new kind of shower, and I didn't get a chance to shower while standing in the bathroom with a man dressed in very sexy clothes standing right in front of me. He looked just like some kind of a god, and when he saw me, he quickly turned and started backing away.</p> <p>"Excuse me!" I shouted. "Excuse me!" I didn't try to walk past him, though he didn't seem to mind. I quickly stepped out of the shower and into the bathroom and started rubbing my face, as I saw there was no water to cover my hair.</p> <p>"Sorry," He quickly said, and looked me up and down. "You've been a bad girl. Don't look at me like that."</p> <p>"I think you'd better leave, or I'll start smelling like a pig" I yelled. Then I quickly stepped out naked, grabbed my towel and walked back towards the bed.</p> <p>I tried to get the towel on over my hair, feeling it creep from my ass. "Are you kidding me? This would be the same with any woman I had..."</p> <p>He laughed. "I am not kidding you. You should go get something more fitting," he said, and looked down at me, still dripping wet. I looked at his cock as I walked to the bed. It was still half hard, and there was still a lot of wetness leaking out of my pussy.</p> <p>I crawled forward on the bed on my hands and knees, turning in a circle so my back was facing him. I quickly slipped onto my stomach, and pulled my ass cheeks apart. I looked back over my shoulder, and saw the face of that guy I fucked yesterday, looking up at me with lust. I slid my finger quickly, and then slowly in to my pussy. I could feel every single hair around my pussy and asshole rubbing against my body as my finger slid into my pussy and I felt him grab my ass in his hand. Then he pushed me backwards, bringing my arms up and down.</p> <p>"You sure you don't want to wear anything?" He pushed me back, and pushed me forward again. I pushed my hands down into my ass cheeks and felt how tight my ass was. God, I had been stretched that way and still had so much muscle control in my ass.</p> <p>"You don't have anything else you can wear?"</p> <p>"Haha. I'm not. If you want to look, you might as well." I didn't really care. I was too horny to care or think straight, and my head was on the pillow. I felt like my cheeks were going to pop from the way he moved them, and was so turned on that when he tried to touch my ass, his fingers could have been made of rock candy and I didn't care. He reached out and started rubbing my breasts, and then I felt him run one of his hands down my belly. He was getting close to my pussy, so I started to rub my clit furiously.</p> <p>"Wait, stop." I was surprised that I wanted to touch it. He pulled my hands away from my ass and pushed my body into the bed. "No, let me go."</p> <p>"What." I was breathing a little shallow now. His hand wasn't stopping this time, and I tried to get up and turn in time. I heard his zipper go down, and I felt his body lying next to mine. I moved my hand down, and then stopped. I took my hands back, and felt as though the whole bed was about to break. It seemed my hands were shaking so much, I had completely lost control.</p> <p>"No." I was panting now. It felt like my lungs were about to collapse from the sheer intensity of what I was feeling. I felt his body press up, and his cock was right in front of me. My knees were about to be ripped off, and I knew I was going to get ripped, even though no one was around to see. "No!" I kept saying this, but he didn't stop me. Instead, he started to kiss my ear, and then my neck.</p> <p>"No?" He whispered. "Don't say it." I couldn't respond. I was just so horny, even though my body wanted this so badly. My pussy was burning, my heart was pounding. I didn't want him to stop, for real. My pussy was aching. I was so crazy with desire.</p> <p>"No, touch me..." I was starting to get scared. "I know you want to..."
