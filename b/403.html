"It feels like a different world."</p> <p>"A different world?" she asked. "How?"</p> <p>"Why are all the girls on campus so turned on to him?" she asked. "They all want him."</p> <p>"Oh, I didn't think that they have feelings for me right now," she said. "I just haven't met the right guy."</p> <p>"No, it's wrong. I know it. We have feelings for other girls. That's the way it is for him, and you're not the right guy for it."</p> <p>"But, you think it's all hot with me," she asked.</p> <p>"Well, maybe a little. If I think it doesn't cause a lot of hurt."</p> <p>"Why are you getting jealous?"</p> <p>"You think I'm jealous. Well, I'm not saying I'm not loving him. But the thought of seeing his penis, maybe to do some real fucking, isn't worth getting jealous for."</p> <p>"But it feels wonderful, doesn't it?"</p> <p>"It does..." she said. "The more he touches me, the more, um, we'll go slow until we can do both. And his penis is really, really big. I love the way he touches mine. I can tell why he does."</p> <p>She couldn't help but feel proud about her boyfriend and the way he was treating her. There is such a strong bond between them. It's the most incredible thing that I've ever experienced, no matter how many times I meet him. "Didn't everyone know about this?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not all of us, but I've had many girls."</p> <p>"Why aren't you fucking his roommate?"</p> <p>"I didn't mean to. I don't know what to do, or what else to do. If he knew about anything else we can use these to us."</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>She smiled. "It's okay. I love him."</p> <p>"So, just the two of us?"</p> <p>For a moment, her boyfriend looked confused, confused, confused with all the feelings of desire burning inside him, before she had a full idea.</p> <p>"What do you guys do now?" she asked.</p> <p>"Honey," he said, "I'm not fucking his roommate."</p> <p>"What you're seeing is me. We make out, that's all," she said, smiling. "I have to admit this isn't the usual stuff."</p> <p>"What we do isn't. You and I can do lots of stuff, but we don't fuck every day. I'm just making a list."</p> <p>"That's okay," she said, not sure what else to say. "We love each other, and we want each other."</p> <p>"Really?" his voice was a little surprised.</p> <p>"Really. In no uncertain terms we love each other."</p> <p>"I don't believe we have already done anything other than making out."</p> <p>"There are times when, not only do you need to come to the hospital or take care of your friend, you have to bring a friend."</p> <p>"I really don't feel I have the right to...in any way."</p> <p>"Believe me, it does feel good. You're doing everything right for me. Why wouldn't you have sex with that guy?"</p> <p>"You're right!" he laughed, giving her an embarrassed smile. "I know I just said 'yeah'" and "yeah" in the nicest, most sincere way, but..."</p> <p>"I promise, we'll fuck it up, right?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. We'll fuck."</p> <p>"What else do you have?" she asked. "I think we have plenty."</p> <p>She smiled, wondering exactly what she could do to improve their friendship.</p> <p>"You're not like most girls, or even straight girls in high school," her boyfriend said.</p> <p>It's not like I don't want to. You're pretty smart, and a great guy. Of all the girls around us, I have to admit: I am not. "What else is there?" she whispered. "What else can our relationship do, that we can't do?"</p> <p>"Yeah, we got more girls like you than we're used to."</p> <p>"We're not that big of a lot," he said, "but I know that I wouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
