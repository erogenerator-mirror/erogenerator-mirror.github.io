Her eyes smiled at me and her voice was warm with a hint of excitement. "Would you like another drink? I brought it back to you with the company."</p> <p>"You've got it," I said, "I'll be right behind."</p> <p>I was about to have another glass of wine, but she stopped me.</p> <p>"Before you make too much of a fuss by asking, I think it's time you got out of your skin and let me look at you?" My heart skipped a beat and I nodded, and her eyes narrowed, waiting. "Now, do you have any idea where we're going? We'll get you out of your clothes and we can undress you."</p> <p>My heart was racing and I felt like I was going to pass out. When I looked at her face, I saw that she was smiling and I knew what she was thinking.</p> <p>"Do you want me to undress you to give you some pleasure?" Her eyes were bright and I knew what I really wanted. I could feel the tension in our bodies.</p> <p>"Yes," I managed, trying to sound small, "yes, I want you to undress me."</p> <p>She laughed and reached out her hand to pat my thigh.</p> <p>"You can do that anytime."</p> <p>We got out of our clothes and sat on the cold terrace together. "How do we do this?"</p> <p>I was in the same position she was in. I opened her blouse and slipped it off, freeing her breasts. She lifted them and ran her hands over them as if she enjoyed holding them instead of letting them go right to her nipples. I watched her as she pulled on her nipples, teasingly, then pulled them as I undid her bra, freeing her breasts. She held them and rubbed them against each other, making them glisten in the moonlight that made them even sexier. I lifted her face and kissed her. We kissed with a passion that overwhelmed the first minute before. Her lips parted as she pressed her mouth against mine, forcing my tongue between her lips. Then, her mouth let go and she sucked her lips off mine with a smile, showing me the passion. My eyes met hers and I wanted to kiss her even more, but she pulled away.</p> <p>"No, stay," she breathed and then laughed. "You're going to need a little more help."</p> <p>With that, her hands flew over my body, grabbing my crotch through my trousers. Her fingers danced over my hardness through the opening of my trousers as if she wanted to touch the length of my cock. I helped her remove my shirt, then let go of her face, and looked into her eyes. Her smile grew as she looked at me and then pulled her top aside to let her breast spill out before me. She kissed down my chest as I unclasped her bra and let her breasts fall, leaving only the shirt, which she tossed over her shoulder. Her nipples were dark pink, and I could feel the heat of her body as her fingers ran down between her breasts. I knelt in front of her, kissing one breast then the other and then back again. I could feel myself hardening as I gazed down at her as she knelt in front of me.</p> <p>Her breathing quickened as my eyes drank in her naked beauty. She reached out and pulled me to her and kissed me deep while I reached around to unfasten her skirt. She pulled my hands free of my belt as I tried to slide it off, but it was difficult to get it over her long, dark hair. I had to move my hands down to the outside of her skirt and undid it once more. Her body was exquisite. I could have spent ages kissing it as I had with every other female human being until today. Now, I wanted to feast on her.</p> <p>Her legs opened as I pulled her skirt down to her knees. She kicked it away, letting her legs fall open and then spread them apart. Her pussy hair was lightened back through the thin patch of hair, highlighting her femininity. I kissed first one side and then the other, then the other. She was wet, her lips glistening in the moonlight as her skin glowed in the sun light. Her pussy lips were puffy, pink, swollen and ready for attention. I kissed her outer lips, then the inner ones, until her pink insides were shining in the lamplight. Her breathing was deeper, a slight moan coming from her chest. Her skin was silky, not too hard or sensitive. She pulled at my belt at the same time she opened herself in anticipation. I slipped my pants off, and took care of her body with the other, kissing her skin as she let me do the work. I put her legs high around my waist as I kissed her again, and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
