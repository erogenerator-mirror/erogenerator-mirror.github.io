The first time's the best. You probably won't even be having one after the first one."</p> <p>"I will. I'll do anything but your daughter."</p> <p>"What? She'll always hate me for that."</p> <p>"I know she will."</p> <p>She turned serious and waited. She knew it wasn't a good idea to be talking about their son. The baby must be a mess already.</p> <p>"Is it?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He looked at his mother. She sighed and looked at him.</p> <p>"When I was little I thought I loved you and would be okay with it but...I was just...wondering."</p> <p>"And that was all you were good for?"</p> <p>"What?" He laughed.</p> <p>"When you were a baby. I thought...maybe you would think with me, you're an emotional cripple. But...the next morning..."</p> <p>"That was over eight years ago. That must be impossible."</p> <p>He laughed again and got up.</p> <p>"I'm going to go get some coffee."</p> <p>***************************************</p> <p>"I need to call work tomorrow and get some work done on this."</p> <p>He had barely got her back up and into the car before she was screaming and clawing at him.</p> <p>"No, you have to work tomorrow. I'm going home."</p> <p>He was still laughing and she had tears in her eyes. He had taken her in the back of the SUV to get her to let him take a shower. She had tried to run him off but he stopped her and held her.</p> <p>"Don't try to run me off...I'll give you the ride home if you want."</p> <p>She had laughed.</p> <p>"That isn't fair. It's my father's home."</p> <p>"So I can drive you back here?" He laughed.</p> <p>"What did not come to pass when we first got together?"</p> <p>"What would you have?" He said gently.</p> <p>"That and all your questions."</p> <p>He laughed and she had grabbed him around the waist and kissed him. It brought tears to her eyes. For a mother it was almost sweet.</p> <p>"No you won't get away with this."</p> <p>"Oh, no I won't," And they kissed again. She knew she would enjoy it.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>When it was time for her to arrive home on Sunday, she spent most of Friday and Saturday at the office. She knew it was important, but she liked to be around him.</p> <p>At eight in the afternoon, David came to her door. She opened it and he saw her at her desk. He knew right in her eyes that he would never see her again. But when he looked closer she could see her face flush with red. He gave her a quick hug and then he looked away.</p> <p>"Please, you look like you were a long time." Her voice went down to just above a whisper.</p> <p>"You made me so happy, David."</p> <p>"I knew I would. Are you sure you don't want to be in the house until you get a new job?"</p> <p>"No, of course I want to be with you. I really do."</p> <p>"Then tell me about it." She sat down as he moved around her desk.</p> <p>"Okay, tell me what you did to get me started."</p> <p>"I had to get the little girl pregnant so I could have daddy's baby any day of the week. I guess I can't say how much that helped."</p> <p>"It helped. What did you have to think about?"</p> <p>"I have no idea."</p> <p>"Maybe you could show me."</p> <p>He stood up and pulled his T-shirt off and threw it into the laundry hamper.</p> <p>"I haven't had anything to do since yesterday. Do you want to be with anyone you want or have daddy's baby? I know that won't be necessary, so don't ask."</p> <p>"I want to be with you," His eyes had a sad expression. He went over to the coffee table and pulled out a chair before leaning over and taking her hand in his.</p> <p>"Okay, you know we can start the water and you can have me while it's still hot," He said and kissed her hand before sitting back.</p> <p>"Would I be able to get away with this?"</p> <p>"I'll see if I can find a job at all."</p> <p>"Okay, that would be nice.
