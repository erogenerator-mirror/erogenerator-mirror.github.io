If you can't do it by the time you hit the beach in the afternoon, you won't be able to eat until after you finish."</p> <p>"I'd have you here by the time the sun comes back." She finished making some more margaritas and sat in front of him. Jason just smiled and gave her a questioning look, making her ask:</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, my boyfriend doesn't love me very much. He's probably in love with his ex-wife, or someone else. I think there's that."</p> <p>"Oh." That was a bit much. Jason noticed that she had a rather dreary expression on her face.</p> <p>"Well, if you don't want to come, take some condoms with you, or get something else, or whatever."</p> <p>"Oh, okay, I guess I'll keep that in mind."</p> <p>"Good. Let me get myself put some food in some food. I was thinking you could get some chicken and eggs if that's okay with you."</p> <p>"What's the usual, hot stuff for breakfast?"</p> <p>"I've heard of it, but never really tried."</p> <p>They ate and talked about school and what they wanted to do. Just as the sun came up, and Jason called the beach house, Kate opened her arms for him and they fell into each other's arms. They kissed and rubbed each others cheeks. The kiss left Jason feeling dizzy and his heart was beating a mile a minute. Kate looked up and saw his lips were still sealed. She kissed them back, then leaned back on the couch and sat up.</p> <p>"I want to ask something about you and Jason. He didn't seem very excited last night, but this morning, I got really weirded out. It felt like we were really close in that we were in each others arms, and I was feeling really lonely, and it's hard to feel like that in your arms when you haven't been anywhere but in me for a long time." She leaned forward and began kissing him again. "It's hard for me to go the long route in life. I've been with couples. Sometimes I know, sometimes I really don't. It is really kind of weird for me. I really wanted to come here with you, but I didn't really feel really comfortable with this whole situation. I really don't care if he was still around. I just want to do something. Do you know what I want?"</p> <p>"I do."</p> <p>"I want to try anything with you. Anytime. Any time. I want Jason to get as good of a kiss on me as I want for himself if that's okay with you, too." She got up and went to Jason. She sat beside him and they pulled on each other's shirts.</p> <p>"I do want an open mouth, and I want to give you a tongue bath. You don't have to go down on me."</p> <p>"I will, and I will try to do whatever I can to make you happy, and keep you happy. I want to kiss you a lot while we're eating breakfast."</p> <p>"You can do everything?"</p> <p>"I'm really good at that. I don't think I can try with something that big. You'll have to make sure Jason, and I trust you, that there are no hard feelings between us, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Jason's not that big. He got in a lot of trouble in high school, and I wasn't too surprised. A little longer and it would be really good for me to have a man to love. If I had gone to college I could still have a steady boyfriend, but I don't know if Jason would want that. He'd be so angry. I know he's probably upset about being separated, but he still wouldn't have a steady boyfriend, would he? I don't know if I can do that."</p> <p>"I'll do what you want. You know me better than I know myself. I've already had a boy over for dinner last night, so I think you get your whole experience ahead of time."</p> <p>"Really? Wow. My boyfriend said I'll have more."</p> <p>"Oh, I get it. I get to be the one that decides. He said I can kiss you." Kate had a serious face on.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Just to get me to be able to do that," he said. "That was a nice kiss you gave me last night, and you're not making any changes to my diet, and I'm pretty sure I want to do the same thing, too. That's all." Then he looked a bit embarrassed.</p> <p>"So that'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
