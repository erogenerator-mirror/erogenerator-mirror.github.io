Are you feeling okay?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I should tell you that I'm a bit shaken by what happened and I've been having some sort of emotional breakdown and I need to go to bed" she said as she walked to my bedside table and opened a small sealed package. "This is what happened."</p> <p>She handed me the small tape measure.</p> <p>"I've had to cut your head off too. You will not be able to come and see me if you don't wish that. Besides, I didn't even leave you alone until you called and it's not like I'll be there waiting for you to pick up anyhow." I said as I checked my cut.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it Doctor. I've been having trouble sleeping and you are right..." she trailed off as she looked at me again.</p> <p>I sat up and moved into the bed with her. She wrapped her soft arms around me and started to fall asleep. I wrapped an arm around her as we laid next to each other kissing tenderly.</p> <p>"It was so wonderful to have a young man take care of me." She whispered.</p> <p>"I felt the same way myself. I hope you are really okay now. I've been having nightmares about seeing you. I'm sorry that I'm not more manly and that I should have used drugs like so many people..." I started telling her.</p> <p>"The only way I can think of to help would be to say that you need to come to bed with me. I want to fall asleep on your chest and you should be exhausted and if you do come to bed I want you to stay with me..." she ended the sentence by rolling over onto her back.</p> <p>She pulled the sheets up but the covers were wet and a light sheen of sweat was on both of us. She smiled at me.</p> <p>"I just wanted to say...I'm sorry, you are the most amazing man for not knowing..." she said softly.</p> <p>"You're so right. I've been in a state of mental turmoil because of you and I haven't tried to talk with anyone since you and I talked, so don't be concerned now," I said as I wrapped my arms around her.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around me and pulled me close.</p> <p>"I think we ought to just sleep next to each other...together," she said with a smile.</p> <p>I had always had a thing about sleeping next to someone, and I really did. We spooned together as we fell asleep into each other's arms. It felt so romantic and so good and somehow comforting at the same time. It was a night I would not soon forget.</p> <p>My parents went to work tomorrow. My sister and I stayed a little late to catch up. My mother was worried and worried about me. She had called the doctor the day after Christmas. I was scared because now I knew that she had done something horrible to me and probably would know how to deal with it.</p> <p>It was too soon after that, but at the same moment knowing something was happening and needing this feeling of closeness with someone and me only made it worse.</p> <p>That morning was the first day that I would actually be home. I was to go home on Monday and be at a meeting with my college professor. I didn't want to go, but I had to. I had been hoping for a chance to be with a person who made me feel safe and who didn't ask me to come and I just couldn't keep coming.</p> <p>I got home at 8 pm and went straight to my house. My mom didn't know I was home either, she had called the dean and the whole thing was already in play.</p> <p>I sat back down, wondering what would happen if I didn't let her know it was going to happen right away. I still wanted to see her, but I didn't say anything.</p> <p>The day passed more slowly than I wanted or needed. At 9 pm she came over to me, dropped into my lap, and put her arms around my neck.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I am such a pain." she whispered.</p> <p>"It's okay. Maybe you would really like to come home again?" I said with as much sincerity I could muster.</p> <p>"That's not all of it. I was just so excited that I couldn't wait until Tuesday..." she said as she gently kissed my neck.</p> <p>"Are you sure your going home tomorrow?" I asked.</p> <p>She smiled, "Yes, tomorrow," as she put her face down on my chest.</p> <p>I was so happy. I would miss her. I missed my sister, who would probably be coming to college at the end of my junior year. I would miss my friend, who would probably just be a freshman and a free agent atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
