I'm going to have a hard enough time explaining to you who is controlling me while I'm in this position." She stood with her legs slightly spread out before settling back. "So I'll just come out and tell you the whole truth."</p> <p>She paused, but only nodded "I think I can see from those two cameras."</p> <p>"Yeah I think you can," I assured her, "but I must insist that we move on."</p> <p>"I'm up for that," she smiled, "I just need some more time."</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed me deeply, her hands running along my body as she responded. We kissed passionately for the longest time before she finally broke the kiss and looked into my eyes before looking back into mine and adding "I think it's time to move on."</p> <p>She stood without moving but she smiled and asked me "So did you like that?"</p> <p>I had, and even though I had felt her leg move with my hand it was only a thin piece of cloth. As she stood I was surprised to see a small amount of softness. It had the appearance of a very soft, well-formed, and very large clit. My eyes began to roam, looking over her body, at her face and what her hands were doing underneath the cloth. I couldn't help but focus on the way her breasts pressed against me.</p> <p>"So? I said it didn't make me nervous," I said smiling back.</p> <p>"You do, do you?" Her smile grew even brighter. "I liked that you told me that you want me to be in charge while I'm in the middle of doing this."</p> <p>"I love hearing what you're capable of doing and the other parts of our relationship. You've brought me this close and I haven't felt anything yet."</p> <p>"Good, because I think we're both ready to learn. I still want the same thing I had originally."</p> <p>I wasn't looking at her face, but instead looked at the small bit of cloth covering one of my breasts. I was very curious about what could happen next. I was also more then a little shocked to see this and also a little frightened at seeing that.</p> <p>She stepped in close, resting her chin on my chin as our lips met. I let out a soft moan as our tongues slid about with each other. She pulled back quickly with a little smile. Releasing me and pulling me close, she leaned in, placing one cheek on my neck as she put her hands around my body and hugged me tightly. "Thank God, we really did that," she said as she hugged me.</p> <p>"Anytime, Anywhere," I smiled back. I looked deep into her eyes as we kissed. "My god, I knew you didn't think I was going to stop."</p> <p>She laughed as she pulled on my cheek. "I wasn't complaining or anything, and I'm glad you were. It was so beautiful out there."</p> <p>"We'll get to it." She then bent down and kissed her way down my body, stopping when she got to the end of my legs. I almost jumped when I felt the cloth against my skin and the kiss on my leg just before she finished my inner thigh.</p> <p>"Oh that's nice," I said as she leaned in and gave me a soft lick from the heel to the other. We kissed for a good 10 minutes after that. "Are you going to do anything?"</p> <p>"I was just thinking about everything at that point."</p> <p>"Me too." I kissed her again before reaching over to her bag and retrieving a second pair of panties. "I think we should start with the shower."</p> <p>We both moved to the shower, still naked, but both looking forward to the other doing things I knew were fun and exciting. It didn't take long before the water began to turn hot. The warm water felt good as it flowed over me until our bodies were covered in the same steam they'd created. As we moved together, our lips moved as the water felt good. We kissed and touched under the shower, each of us exploring every part of the other's body we could reach while our hands and bodies moved on their own.</p> <p>I found her breast with one hand as my other went to her ass just as my lips and tongue made contact with her clit. She let out a soft moan as my tongue explored her sensitive spot, while my hands rubbed up and down her thighs. The water was heating up. It felt different, even though I could hear the steam rising. I felt as though I was in some kind of trance. It was an almost magical experience. Her clit seemed harder. I couldn't understand the feeling. We kissed a little more and turned a littleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
