I should take a break, do some work on the new parts of my life, and maybe live a quiet life.</p> <p>I take my cell phone out of my pocket, and hit the button to shut the phone off.</p> <p>I have been on the computer, working on building up a new life for myself, and it has all been perfect so far.</p> <p>I close my eyes for a few more seconds, and start walking toward the bedroom. As I approach the bedroom, I find a note on the computer:</p> <p>"I am sorry for making you wait! - M.I.L.</p> <p>I have been thinking about you all day, and here you are, my housewife, on your way back to me!"</p> <p>I open the bedroom door, and find this note sitting on the computer. A picture of a young man, who looks very handsome in a t-shirt, pants, and a pair of boxers, is standing on the bed.</p> <p>It reads "Teddy bears"</p> <p>I open the letter, and see that it is from M.L. in the area.</p> <p>"Teddy bears," I say, and then, as I turn and walk over to the bed, "what's wrong?"</p> <p>"Nothing, Teddy, " she says,</p> <p>"What happened?"</p> <p>"Nothing like that," she says, "nothing you didn't do that made you a bear."</p> <p>I open my eyes in shock, and say, "That's impossible! What just happened? Why aren't you in the bathroom?"</p> <p>"My bathroom has a mirror over it, so you can see into my bedroom, and I want to show it to you as much as I can," she says.</p> <p>My eyes still wide, I say, "But why did you bring me here?"</p> <p>"You have to admit, you don't even look at the guy in the video. He's just here!"</p> <p>"But Teddy, we had a...a relationship, and it ended like this...what if he was with someone else?"</p> <p>I am shocked, and still shaking. As I look away, the words register, and I see how she is talking, so I start to laugh.</p> <p>"What's so funny!"</p> <p>"We have...relationship," she says, "we live separately...a little."</p> <p>"But if you were with him..."</p> <p>"No. That's no way to live!"</p> <p>"I guess it doesn't have to," I say.</p> <p>"Then we can talk about how you feel about this," she says, "as long as you understand that you are really my friend. That I am a friend, not just a housewife."</p> <p>"But..." I begin to question myself.</p> <p>"But Teddy, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you something really important and right away," she said.</p> <p>"And how...do I know you're not a cheater?" I ask.</p> <p>"Not a cheater," she adds, "I'm only asking 'what happens in this life,'" she says with a smile that she is starting to get.</p> <p>"Okay," I say, "but what about marriage?"</p> <p>"I think it's best," she responds, "at this point in time, if the situation isn't right, we can try again?"</p> <p>"Sure," I say, "if you think it's right..."</p> <p>"Good," she says with a smile, "I thought I was the one for you, in more ways than one..."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Why not? It looks like you have done it before."</p> <p>"Are you really proposing that I don't?" I ask.</p> <p>"No, and I didn't come all this way for sex with Teddy," she replies.</p> <p>"And I won't ask...you don't have to..." I look away, and start to think that I am being stupid.</p> <p>"No," she says with a smile, "there's a lot I want to know about you. So, don't just say 'no,'" she says, and then, after a pause, just stands up on her toes, and gives me a peck on the lips.</p> <p>I look away as best I can, but she can tell it's not going to be easy.</p> <p>"I guess I am not going to be cheating here," I say.</p> <p>She just holds me for a couple of seconds, as if she wants to say something.</p> <p>"Maybe...maybe," she says, "I am trying toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
