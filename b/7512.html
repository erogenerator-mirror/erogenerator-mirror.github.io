We have only been married two weeks and I haven't thought about what we might go up to today. I'm sorry for being a bitch tonight and just looking at you, I can really tell you like how I look, and being married makes me feel so naughty. I was just thinking about the things we would do together when we got back from our honeymoon. We can go to your room right now, take a shower together and I will take your clothes off and put some music on before we go to bed. You can put your underwear on before you start feeling naked and then we can go down to bed for some serious sex. I am hoping you won't mind me having your wife naked while you have to listen to music on the radio? We'll just have to get some toys from the night table and we can just have fun right here in the bedroom."</p> <p>She was going to say no right then and there, but instead she said, "I don't know, maybe if I had some lube or something you wouldn't ask me."</p> <p>"Well, I'm always in control, I won't ask you to do something you don't want to do because I'll probably just grab your arm and steer you into your bedroom." But with that she started laughing and before she finished I was laughing too.</p> <p>"So you're okay with this, why do you need something else in your room while you are with me?" I asked. She didn't answer right away.</p> <p>"Do you want it naked, naked in front of me?" I finally asked her. She smiled and answered, "Oh yeah, I guess I do."</p> <p>"Would you do it when you were dancing with me in the club?" I asked her.</p> <p>"It's always been a turn on." She said with a big grin on her face.</p> <p>She started with the first move, "So you like that, do you?"</p> <p>"Of course I do" she answered.</p> <p>"And you do want to have your way with me, don't you? That's such a turn on isn't it?" I asked</p> <p>"Yes, it is." She answered.</p> <p>At this point, it was getting harder to keep from making love to her right now. But she was determined. So she moved in between my legs with her back to me and the position was to get back onto my lap so she could have complete control over the whole situation. She was pushing me back so hard against my knee it was almost causing me to lose control. I put my hands under her arms and she immediately leaned back towards me. My hands caressed her breasts and then started to unbutton her dress before removing it entirely. I then started to remove her bra while she kissed me. I then unzipped the back of her dress and she pulled it away from her and off her arms to reveal her breasts. At this point, I noticed she was wearing pink lacy garter belt with a strap. Her nipples were standing straight up and it was a sight I'll never forget. Her hands grabbed my cock (which had started to stiffen and get harder) and she started to jerk me off while moving her hips in and out in an almost steady motion, while kissing me. At least I thought so, at that point I didn't really care what happened. But after some time, she was pulling it harder and moaning, so I started to match her movements so she could move her hips in and out a little faster. And it was not long before my cock was fully erect and her nipples were standing straight out which were clearly making me harder than I wanted to be.</p> <p>She then stood up and took off her panties and the rest of her clothes, all while looking me in the eyes with her legs spread slightly. "Come here," she panted</p> <p>And I did. She took the vibrator that I had taken from the dresser earlier in case we wanted to get a few moments together before we went up to my room and put it inside me. "How long will it take you for your cock to become fully erect?" she asked me.</p> <p>"A while, maybe I'll fuck my wife first, then you can take a while."</p> <p>"Sure we can, but I don't know about that."</p> <p>"I've been dreaming about it all night long. Just go slowly."</p> <p>She placed the vibrator against my crotch, which felt strange without her panties. But I figured that I could do that for both of us, so I slid my shorts down and she helped my cock out and then started to stroke it. The vibrator was going in and out and in a circular motion at the same time.</p> <p>"That feels so good."
