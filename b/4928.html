In the same moment he saw Sarah walk in and sat up in the chair. She reached out and squeezed his hand and whispered, "I'm sorry, but I can't help you that much. I'm just sorry it happened. God you're so big."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I just didn't think it through."</p> <p>She reached out and kissed him. "There must be someone who would like to help you," she said into his ear. "I'm sure you can find another volunteer."</p> <p>"No, I can't. I can't. I'm so embarrassed."</p> <p>"I'm glad that you know how you are. Now give me your hand."</p> <p>Gasping he brought his left to her hand and rubbed the palm over the back of it as he knelt in the chair. She reached down with her right hand and felt he hot skin. His fingers curled around it and she felt the skin on her hand tremble under his touch.</p> <p>"Is it OK?" she said, her voice a tremble.</p> <p>"It's fine."</p> <p>"Do you need to go?"</p> <p>"No, I just might have."</p> <p>"Then you better go. I don't mind."</p> <p>Looking back at her, he felt that his knees would buckle from the shock of her touch. She didn't let go of his hand and didn't break, but she put it back again.</p> <p>"I'm sorry! I love you!"</p> <p>"You love me?" she asked with a laugh. "Then I need you to do something for me."</p> <p>She reached out and touched his cheek. He felt a warmness in her hand but didn't see it. "There's someone I could use your body for a while."</p> <p>"Someone I trust better than you." She smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you," he said. "I just wanted to give you a warm welcome."</p> <p>She smiled warmly, "You're welcome. Let's go to bed."</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>John felt a weight lift from his chest and he knew that he was about to fall asleep. He could hear the sounds of his wife laughing and he closed his eyes to rest. He could feel her arms around his shoulders and he could feel her legs wrapped around his waist and feel her warm breath on his nose. A feeling of exhilaration passed over him. He was suddenly aware of his cock rising in his briefs. He was very aware of it. Sarah's soft smile had made it hard to ignore. Her laugh and breath were warm on his nose. All he could think about was how wonderful this had been and he smiled. He could do this again. There would be no end in sightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
