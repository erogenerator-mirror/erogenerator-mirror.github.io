I tried to think of a good question, but couldn't seem to get the words out. I had to ask if I could, no! But not wanting to be the cause of that, I just went with my instinct. When we were back in the bedroom, I had to do everything with him that I remembered and it turned into a wild orgasm. It was fantastic! Afterwards, we fell asleep in each other's arms, completely spent and not thinking of anything. After a few moments thinking a little more in terms of what I'd learned, I realized, it's probably best if we never discuss it again, and I'm not looking to get married right now.</p> <p>After I got back home, in the evening, I could tell my dad was getting a little restless. He was saying a lot about what had happened the other night, and that was upsetting him. We all knew that he'd had his eyes closed, and that he was a little out of it. I guess he hadn't noticed that I had started feeling guilty about what we'd done the other night. I'm sure that he didn't realize that he wasn't going to tell anyone.</p> <p>"Mom, what's the matter with you, baby? Is that it? Is it that you feel guilty about how you acted?" My dad's voice raised. I felt a little embarrassed for thinking that about my big brother, but it felt so good that I couldn't help it.</p> <p>"It's nothing, honey," I tried to explain. "It's just that..." I stopped. My mom and dad shook me off. I was a little embarrassed, but didn't want them to notice that. But I was afraid to tell about it.</p> <p>"Go to sleep, sweetheart," my dad said quietly, and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>I had an epiphany. I could now be honest about all of what had happened. Dad, and I can't say that for one bit. I'm proud of the way we've been carrying on, and my mom knows, too. That's pretty much all that's left from it.</p> <p>I think Dad has always found me attractive and in demand. He didn't put it quite like that, I think. He didn't think that I liked it, either, but that I was getting horny and wanted a lot."</p> <p>"I wish your mother could see that look on your face," my dad said, leaning over in the chair. "I'd like to talk to you about that. I can't see how you can explain about how you made me feel like that."</p> <p>"I think you should talk to her about that," I told him. "I'm sure she'd love to see it, too."</p> <p>I think Dad's mood improved at the news, because he looked relieved. "You're right, Mom," he said. "I mean it. Let me get to bed, too."</p> <p>I put Dad down and we stood for a moment. It felt good to do it. Dad kissed my cheek, then my jawline, and then again kissed my lips. It seemed a very intimate gesture. "Do you want a shower," he asked?</p> <p>"No, that would be nice," I replied. "It's a little tender tonight."</p> <p>After a long moment, we got dressed and went upstairs. We had no idea what to wear. I had a simple white blouse and my shorts, while Dad had on the blue tank and sweatshirt. We headed for the den and laid down on our sides of the couch. Dad put his arm around me and cuddled me as he kissed my cheek, then my eyelids, then my lips. I felt his other hand reach up and rub my breasts lightly. I moaned and pressed my breasts into his hand and he caressed my breasts a little.</p> <p>I started moving my hips a little in an absent minded direction. I think his hand came to rest between my legs. He caressed my labia, then teased my clitoris, and then slid another finger inside me. I felt a tingle of excitement. My breathing started coming in short gasps and I closed my eyes and tilted my head so I could look into his face. As he did everything in my direction, I reached up my hands and touched his face. My breathing increased until it was coming in deep gasps. I could feel his cock against my leg and I started stroking it slowly, feeling it through his body, too.</p> <p>I heard his breathing deepen. The sound of skin on skin caused my own nipples to harden. He ran two fingers back and forth over my labia and then moved his fingers in little circles, spreading my moisture over his hand. He was making me feel so good.</p> <p>I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
