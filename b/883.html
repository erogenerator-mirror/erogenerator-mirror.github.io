It's getting hotter," I tell myself. "So close and hot." I can't really see. I can only feel the walls getting hotter. "I must be sweating. And hot..."</p> <p>We are at the cabin now. The wind is moving from behind us. The cabin must be on it's last legs. This sounds weird. Just me and the cabin, the cabin I know, and the cabin I'm trying to sleep in with my boyfriend just a few feet from us. "It's getting hot," is all it is.</p> <p>His head on my thigh, he whispers, "It's hot," he whispers.</p> <p>"It's fucking hot," I hear him say.</p> <p>"Hush," I hear him say. "If we weren't naked you wouldn't hear us."</p> <p>He puts his hand on my waist. "Shh..." and he grabs my ass with his big fat hand. I feel it, so warm and hard, with his hard-on and now on mine and our thighs. His hand is so large and so much it makes me squirm around with that excitement. I start to squirm all over his hand.</p> <p>"How do you feel, honey? How did you feel?" he asks.</p> <p>"Oh...oh! Oh..."</p> <p>We are both shaking from the excitement of it. He has his mouth on mine, his face pressed against my neck and his big hand on me, his lips on my throat and my bare breasts. "Oh, mom...oh...oh..."</p> <p>I feel like I want my boyfriend to have me and touch me and kiss me and suck me and fuck me and fuck and suck me.</p> <p>And he does, and I feel so sexy. So aroused, so aroused for him. What I hadn't considered is how much he would want to make me say this or feel me so he could fuck me. But the excitement made it all seem so real. A sexy, desirable, sexy young mother wanting her son to fuck her and make me have sex with him. His face, his body. Your face. Your own mother on the bed. He makes me want to want this too.</p> <p>"I'm on the bed, mom...on the bed with you. I'm lying on my back. I'm touching you. And you are touching me too," he says.</p> <p>My body is tense and hot. My mouth is dry, my vagina is moist. I feel so hot...so aroused...so excited. The wind has started to pick the tempo again.</p> <p>"Take off your underwear," he says. "I want to make love with you, mom."</p> <p>I know what he wants. He wants to show me that we can have sex with it. He wants us to be alone together. But as soon as he has seen me naked he wants to do it and make love with me too. Right where I want it to happen.</p> <p>I let him take my underwear off. His hard-on is a heady heat in my belly. I love the feel of his body. The touch of his hard-on, the hardness, the power and of his masculinity.</p> <p>"Hush, Mom." His hard-on is against me. I feel how smooth and warm it is. I love it. It's warm against my naked body so soft and wet. His hand is between my legs. I can feel his big, callused hands between my thighs. His hands are warm and strong and I let it happen. I want to feel him inside of me. I want him to feel my naked body. To slide me. I want to feel his hardness inside of me and fill me with his thickness. To be in me with my own son. He has opened me up to myself, he has my naked womanhood filled with his hard cock, his hands and his cock.</p> <p>I can see him, see he is holding my naked body. My heart is beating fast and wild. My stomach is tight. I could feel it. My vagina throbbing. I felt him. I wanted to feel him inside of me. Make love to him. I could feel him.</p> <p>"Shhh, Mom," he says again.</p> <p>I feel my body quivering in waves, my breasts hard and my whole body is trembling. "I want you, Mom," he whispers.</p> <p>I don't know where he is so quiet, even in the warm air. But there is something strange about that.</p> <p>He's looking at me, his face so close to mine. "Look at me for a moment," he says. "When I want you to feel my body for yourself, you can look at my body, mom. Don't look at me, just look at my body." The words so come out of him, so right.
