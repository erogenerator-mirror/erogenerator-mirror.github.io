I believe I might go on with our meeting but I don't think so with you so busy." I spoke, "I'm not ready to start anything yet. It's important that you finish your training at least once before you go back to being your own boss." I had waited for my voice to come back.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to start something right away." he asked quietly. "I was hoping I would last longer once I started." he added. He took a deep breath and stepped back. "What can I do for you, my dear? I'll talk to you in a couple of weeks and see if I could get you back on track with your training." he said.

He thanked me, and I got a kiss on the cheek that he had not been expecting, and we went to bed.</p> <p>The next day I got a note on my answering machine, so I quickly programmed it. I was sitting in the living room drinking a glass of wine, and reading the messages. "It's very nice to finally meet a real man." I started to type, but stopped and looked at the phone, before going to write a reply. I typed in, and waited for the message to come. When it did, I had to hit enter to see what was on the message.
