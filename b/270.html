I could feel the tingling in my pussy begin to spread over, to my stomach down to my crotch. This was not going to be the first time I did this, but I knew it was going to be far from the first time I did it like this. The towel came to just above my nipples, I stood in front of John in only my small underwear, and he could see the outline of my hard nipples. I smiled as I saw him blush as he smiled back. I slowly walked across the bathroom to open the door. John reached over me and helped me out. "Hmmmm...that's a nice towel and a nice little landing strip on each side of the tub. I could watch that for forever."</p> <p>"And you can watch all the time," I continued, "But you can't see too much of her in there." I gave a quick glance at his bulge. He must have felt the same way. He grabbed that towel and wrapped it around me and helped me turn the shower on. He stepped into the shower and adjusted the position of the stream of water. I turned around and he held his hands out from the stream, allowing it to hit my face and neck, covering me completely.</p> <p>"Oh!" I said, "I couldn't see your hands."</p> <p>I was enjoying the feeling of having him in the shower with me covered in water and watching him. I turned around and looked at him and smiled. "If you can't see it, you look in my mirror," I said. I turned a bit more so I could see the mirror from my angle better. He had pulled back the shower curtain and stepped in. I stepped on the tiled floor in front of him and lowered myself down over his waist. When I was about two inches above his bulge I moved my body and placed my hands behind the back of the shower curtain, allowing John to step into the shower. His hard cock was nestled between the cheeks of my ass and pushed between them.</p> <p>John stepped into the shower and sat on his knees. His strong hands began working on my body. His fingers found my nipples, he gently kneaded the softness of my breasts as he kissed the back of my neck and ear. He slowly let his cock sink against my ass and I felt his hard dick rubbing into the crack between my cheeks. I was so turned on that my pussy began wetting down there. He pulled his cock from my ass and held it up between my legs. He bent and ran his tongue over my wet and swollen lips and slowly began to kiss them. When he reached up and started massaging the swollen flesh with his hands it felt so good. We were locked in our embrace of passion and pleasure. His body was pressed against me and his cock was pressed lightly into my ass.</p> <p>"Mmmm..." I mumbled when he slid his tongue into my mouth. His hands had moved up and had grasped my waist. I leaned further forward and wrapped my legs around his body. Our mouths parted and I moaned while we kissed. It was so hot and heavy; my nipples were rock hard and my pussy was soaking it.</p> <p>John pulled back and got a towel and quickly finished drying off and then began to dress. He stepped in front of me and gave me little kisses and a good hard swat on my round ass. He smiled. "Honey, it has been a pleasure meeting you."</p> <p>"Me too," I said. "I hope we still have time to see each other around your place."</p> <p>I got out the first of my clothes and put it on slowly, thinking that it would be a long night.</p> <p>John did the rest of the arrangements, and I put on a black lacy bra and a nice pair of white thigh-high stockings, and then a light pink lace top, which was not exactly comfortable with the straps that had so tightly bound my body. I wore my pink panties and my lacy bra. The white was soft and fluffy.</p> <p>The night had finally arrived and we had to leave very quickly. John paid the money he had arranged and we got out of the cab. As we turned towards my front, my hand reached out and felt his cock. Oh, the hard lump was already beginning to throb. He gave me a slow smile as we began the short walk home. My panties were soaked so I could feel the wetness of my crotch against the cloth of my panties between my legs. My pussy lips were engorged andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
