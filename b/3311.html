I closed my eyes. My body was shaking and quivering. I was shaking with need. Her head was on my chest. It didn't make any difference to her what was there. She was still on her back. Her lips were close to my ear. I felt her breath on my ears and I felt myself squirming and quaking. I could be still, could still do that. My hands were on her sides and I was pressed against her. I had never felt such an intimate, but still so sexy.</p> <p>My cock was rigidly hard, I thought aching, begging to be released. The sight of her naked, so voluptuous, so voluptuous, looking up at me with so much beauty, and her body in all it's sensual contours, so sexy, so lovely, so irresistible, made my balls ache.</p> <p>I had to be, to have her. I wanted it, I wanted her. I was going to do it, I was going to fuck the shit out of her and I knew it. Her name was Christina, or Christina, whoever she was, she just got fucked for money and she was as horny as hell too. I wanted it and I wanted it now, right there in bed with her, with every fiber of me. I had no conscience at all.</p> <p>I wanted, needed it desperately. I was going to do it and I wanted Christina. She was everything I was not. I did not care how much I thought, or how many years in the future or the fact that I felt, and just how much I liked sex and it. The fact that it was happening again; I didn't care. I wanted to touch her. I wanted to press my cock into her and be inside her all night long and never stop. I couldn't think of any way to find out. I didn't care about anything other than making her come.</p> <p>Her face was near mine and she was so gorgeous. Her mouth was next to my ear and I could smell her. How did she do it? She was so pretty, and that made me want to kiss her and lick her. She could be in my arms, pressed against I can't remember but, or, she wanted to press a little closer and I wanted to push my cock into her. She was pressing up against my body and her tits were still pressed against the bed. I had her, naked, naked with me in full view of all of those people who come to our house and don't get a hard-on for each other before, just a second ago, but, now with these people, I wanted to be there.</p> <p>My hands, they were shaking. I could see the outline of the sheet beneath her. I had to have her. She was making me crazy. I needed her.</p> <p>I felt her hair on my face. I loved what she made me feel and I loved the smell, the texture, the taste of her, of the way she smelled, even the thought of her hair, her perfume, of her skin so alive and all over my body, made my cock ache and throb.</p> <p>I was in love with her. I was not sure how else to start, but I had to. I needed to. "Christina," I whispered.</p> <p>"Oh honey," she murmured, "I'm not done."</p> <p>I couldn't believe what she said. She's done it, she wanted it. I didn't know what to say to that, what I wanted to say.</p> <p>"I love it," she said, "it's so nice."</p> <p>I could not believe my ears. God, she said yes. I should have been insulted.</p> <p>"I'm not done," she said.</p> <p>She was right, of course. I was in love with her, too, more than I ever thought I had, even more than I expected. I wanted to say it, but didn't.</p> <p>"Christina?" I begged.</p> <p>"I'm ready for you, baby, I'm ready for you."</p> <p>I was, too, I was so ready. "God, I can't believe it," I gasped, "I have to, I need to, I need to."</p> <p>"It's okay, baby," she said calmly. "Let's just say it, okay? It means everything. I'm yours, okay?"</p> <p>"Yes," I breathed back. I meant it. I had to do that. I had to fuck her. I had to do her. But, was I supposed to? I couldn't do that. I wasn't, I couldn't fuck her. I didn't feel like I was either doing it to her or to anyone else. It was okay, sweet.
