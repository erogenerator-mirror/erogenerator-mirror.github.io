A tiny part of her mind was screaming, "How?" But she couldn't. Her body was on fire, and she desperately wanted it.</p> <p>He was in between her legs, pressing his hard cock against her pussy.</p> <p>"Wait," she said, "I don't know how much of this is for you to take. And I don't care. Just lie there and I'll tell you one of the things that is for you."</p> <p>When he laid down after a while, she rolled over on her back and opened her legs as wide as she could. She held on to them for a few seconds until he stood up and moved forward. He positioned himself on top of her and slid his cock inside her. Her pussy wrapped itself around him, but no movement.</p> <p>He leaned forward and pulled back after a few moments.</p> <p>"Where do you want me to start?"</p> <p>"I want you in me, all of you at once."</p> <p>He slowly slid into her. At first he just had to move, but when she wrapped that tightness around him, he felt it start to open up, and it felt wonderful for him to plunge in in this wild state of passion that he wanted to get right there. He thrust forward, harder.</p> <p>"Harder, faster," she croaked. "You have to do it! Faster, now!"</p> <p>As he thrust into her, she wrapped her legs around him, and they both held onto each other for support. A few strokes into her pussy and he could feel the tension, so he started to pound in and out. They had their first real physical contact, and he was already close to cumming as well.</p> <p>"That's right," she moaned. "Harder."</p> <p>And she grabbed his backside and tried to take him deeper into her. He thrust harder and faster, and within a few moments he could feel himself getting close.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum," he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Now." She reached behind her on the other side and took hold of his balls and squeezed.</p> <p>He exploded right in her pussy as he started to cum into her. It didn't stop there. In fact, it came more rapidly as his cum emptied deep into her. She clutched him and pulled him on with all her might.</p> <p>They stayed in that position for several minutes, but finally he pulled out of her pussy and they collapsed over onto the bed.</p> <p>"Wow," he said "that was some of the best sex I've ever had".</p> <p>She smiled. "I think that makes me one of the best cums that's ever happened to me."</p> <p>"No kidding."</p> <p>They didn't say a word to each other for a long minute. They were both breathing heavily. And they were still covered in sweat.</p> <p>"You're a good fuckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
