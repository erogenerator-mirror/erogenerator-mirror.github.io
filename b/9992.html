I'm sure."</p> <p>"Yes we did," I answered. "And I'm sure you enjoyed it too. As a matter of fact, did you make it in there with me."</p> <p>"Yes, that is quite a compliment." She was still feeling guilty about the past. "You are a very pretty man, you know."</p> <p>"Thank you for saying that, and that is what the night will be worth," I replied.</p> <p>"I am sure," she agreed.</p> <p>She kissed me cheekily, then looked around the room. "I don't think we should go in there, Jack. You have already gotten me all worked up. There's nothing to be thankful about."</p> <p>"That's true. I want to. I want to do everything for you, and to make you feel that I have."</p> <p>"That's right. I was ready to do anything for you."</p> <p>"You and I just didn't do any of that for a while," I assured her. "You're doing a fantastic job showing me that it's you that I'm interested in."</p> <p>"No, sweetheart, not again," she giggled. "You have a lot of nerve flaunting yourself to me."</p> <p>"I'm glad we've come to this agreement. Now, do you have some condoms in your bag?"</p> <p>"Here." And there, on the table, I found a packet.</p> <p>"Did you use one last time?" she asked, a bit hesitantly.</p> <p>"It's not necessary. There's no need. We have a few last-minute things to accomplish."</p> <p>"Well I wouldn't want to take advantage of you. If you feel like you're going to be damaged tonight, we can take things a little further."</p> <p>"Would that be such a bad thing? I'm sure you wouldn't mind. I promise not to go too far. I am a virgin and I know I'm not good-looking or any such thing."</p> <p>"Oh, sweetheart, sweetheart. That sounds good, too," I smiled, and she kissed me again.</p> <p>"I'm just afraid that it might be kind of a turn on for you. You're married. I have no way of knowing whether or not you might want me."</p> <p>"You won't know until you try." And I would try. "Anyway, the condoms are in there, sweetheart. I won't get into any trouble there."</p> <p>I picked up a pair and handed them to her. "Don't worry about them," I assured her. "Just put them in the top right hand pocket."</p> <p>In the meantime, Carla had picked out a bottle of suntan lotion, and she liberally applied it to my backside. Then she handed me another pair of boxers.</p> <p>"Here, put these on." And she handed me a set of her own panties which she stuffed in my right hand. "Oh, these might be a little bit small, but these are a real treat," she said. She then lifted one of the panties up and pulled it up toward her. "Would you like to see me use them tonight?" she asked.</p> <p>"That would be great."</p> <p>"We have to have more than that, though," she said, and she pulled them up a bit higher. I could sense that she was putting a lot of lotion into the crotch area of the panties as she did so.</p> <p>"Okay," I managed.</p> <p>"Good, now we can start your show." And she took off the rest of her clothes while I got undressed. When we got into the bathroom, she took me into the bathroom's shower. I saw that the other end was directly over the toilet. And I could see Carla smiling as she looked herself up in the mirror. She had on one of the skimpiest little bikinis I have ever seen in my life. It was just snug against her body, but it was snug around her, revealing her body quite a bit. And once again, the bottom of her crotch was on display, while the front hem of the bikini had ridden up quite a bit. She looked a bit like an American spy, and I couldn't help noticing that despite her beauty, she did have a wonderful body, which was quite nice. And as much as I wanted to see that bikini, I couldn't see I as getting any attention. So she stepped in front of me as I was showering, and began to kiss me as she was doing. "Do you like what you see?" she asked. "It's nice to have a man at homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
