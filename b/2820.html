But now that we're here, what I'm thinking is, I am getting a bit nervous."</p> <p>"Don't worry!"</p> <p>"But, maybe... something has changed for me."</p> <p>"What? You don't want me to go to my room, and to my parents?"</p> <p>"No! But maybe we should try something."</p> <p>"What do you mean? I've been in my room before. Are we going to try to talk about it together, or, is there a better one just around here?"</p> <p>His expression changed then. "Let them think what they want, John. We were supposed to give them a show for Christmas and New Year's... what they want, they can't have. We agreed not to show them that the show for Christmas and New Year's we have. But you, I don't want to be seen looking at your underwear. If you want to go in your underwear on your way to your parents, just do it. I'd really appreciate it if you would do it for me."</p> <p>John looked at her without understanding, then remembered what he had planned with Mavin. And did not see or care about how she would feel. He also saw in Mavin what he had just suggested, she was going to have to go in her underwear and go to her parents. A strange thought came to him, "But if we go in her underwear... maybe we'll not see what she has on under there."</p> <p>"What do you mean? I'm going to look at her underwear, you're not going to look in her underwear!"</p> <p>"But it's just a small bit right now. I'll just put my hand on her thigh, to keep it from moving."</p> <p>"But, if we go in her underwear and she gets nervous or something..."</p> <p>"I don't mind!"</p> <p>John got up and walked over to where Mavin was sitting. "Hey Mavin, what's going on?"</p> <p>"It's not that!"</p> <p>"Not how it started, is it? I'm the one standing here. Besides, you are the one that's nervous."</p> <p>Mavin stood up. "Not really. But..."</p> <p>"Come on, just do it..."</p> <p>Mavin got up and walked towards her. "But you feel nervous?"</p> <p>"Yes, I did. I'm going to do it."</p> <p>Mavin turned and walked over to the bed, pulled back the covers and then stood next to her.</p> <p>John looked at her. "Well, go for it, I don't have you sleeping on your knees on me."</p> <p>Mavin took her position on it. "Okay."</p> <p>John climbed into bed. He lay on his side and put his leg over her leg, taking one of her hands. "Here, this will help," he said. He put one of his hands under her chin, so it was up, and lifted her head. "Here, I'll put my arm around you." John lifted her head up and then placed his hand on her cheek. "There, just relax honey. I'll take care of everything. I'll hold you if you want."</p> <p>Mavin relaxed and felt her heart beating rapidly. She felt her heart racing, felt like she was flying around. "Can I be comfortable with you?"</p> <p>John chuckled, "Just relax, relax. There's nothing else I care about. Just relax, honey."</p> <p>Mavin put his arm around her shoulders, so their chest pushed together. John stroked her hair, her cheek, her neck. She felt him slowly moving her hair away from her neck. It had a thin, light, sexy texture on it. Just to feel. Her skin felt hot. Her pulse quickened. She felt his fingers run through her hair, and up and down her neck under her hair.</p> <p>John's hand went under her neck, and up over her hairline. He put his hand on her cheek, and then over her lips. Mavin felt his warmth around her, moving toward her lips. "Mavin, I don't want to go in there, I just want to hold you." John's voice was warm in her ear as he said it.</p> <p>Mavin put her hand on his thigh, and he moved his leg out, causing his crotch to rub along her leg as he moved his hand up her neck. He ran his fingers up and down her cheek, and along her neck, around her jaw line. His hands went over her shoulders, down her arms and back up, and then went down to her breasts. He cupped his hand on her breast and then ran his hands all the way to her nipples.</p> <p>Mavin felt his hands rubbing up and down along her breasts. His thumb felt like a finger as it ranâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
