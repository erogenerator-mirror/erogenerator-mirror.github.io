She nodded.</p> <p>"You're fucking him? How do you do that?"</p> <p>"Fucking." Her voice quivered. "It's so dirty... You're a dirty girl. I can't stop touching myself when I'm tied up. I can't even touch myself to please you, because I'm aching. Oh, God."</p> <p>"Is this the first time I've ever had sex with a girl?"</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful. You can tell by the way men react if you want to fuck them. They're all ready for it. I can only imagine the men in your village have seen everything they've been waiting for. Can we?"</p> <p>"Fuck me," she whispered. "Please."</p> <p>She felt very vulnerable under his hand as she opened her eyes to look up at him. She knew what she had to do. She had to do to him everything she was ever capable of doing to him: giving his cock the pleasure it craved. How could she possibly give this man the love she'd waited to experience for years? She was a slut. She was anything but a slut. He was going to do whatever he wanted with her. What else could she do?</p> <p>"Say it."</p> <p>"I want you," she said, "I like having you in me. I'm going to be anything you want me too," she emphasized. "You can just fuck me any way you want, anytime you want. Just fuck me."</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>"I am completely in control. I'm going to get fucked. And I'm going to have my way. I'm going to give the men what they want. I'm going to give them a nice show and a show they'll never forget."</p> <p>"Oh, God."</p> <p>With that last word, Sarah went over to the edge of the pool and lay down on her back. He pulled his robe apart, then tied it away. He grabbed his erection and shoved it into her pussy. She squealed and said, "Fuck, yes." He fucked her for only a minute before he reached under her and grabbed her nipples. He twisted them and she said, "Don't hurt them," but the more he twisted them the more intense the feeling got inside her body. She didn't care. She had never felt so alive before. Her body was on fire. She loved it.</p> <p>It took him only seconds to cum. His thrusting became more purposeful. He thrust deep into her, held his cock in her a very long time. Then he pulled it out and watched as her face turned a bright red. She looked around before saying quietly, "No, let me go."</p> <p>He didn't let her go. He wrapped his arm around her and pushed her down over her back. "On your knees," he said. He said it so hard it hurt. When she was on her knees, he leaned into her. He kissed her. She turned her head and said one word. "Yes."</p> <p>When he was done, he said, "You're not going to regret this." And he walked out of the cabin. "I'm very disappointed in you." And she thought about him. Maybe he'd done what she wanted, as they had a chance of doing last evening and this morning. But he had no such chance of ever having sex with her, that is, until he had to have the sex of his heart. That thought wasn't lost on her.</p> <p>"Don't ever forget about me," she said. "You'll see that you're not the only one who wants to fuck. And I want this to be a good time to be with you as well."</p> <p>Sarah thought about it more and more. It was so unfair to feel like she'd only had sex with a man once. She thought to herself, "What would my husband think if he knew he had made love to a woman he cared about?" She said it again without thinking.</p> <p>Then she remembered. That's not a nice thing to say to a man. They should be talking about a matter of fact thing, like why you're a little old for them. But it took her mind away from herself.</p> <p>She realized she was still tied up. He wouldn't be able to resist her. They could get caught again. She didn't know what her husband would do next.</p> <p>Sarah thought she had been in trouble in the past, but never thought about sex with someone likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
