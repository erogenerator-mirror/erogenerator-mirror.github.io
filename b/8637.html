He grinned back at her. He hadn't expected her to play along so fast.</p> <p>She felt his eyes scanning her, she felt his eyes moving from her lips to her eyes, her cheeks, forehead, nose. His eyes moved so fast that she almost felt dizzy with the energy of it. She turned her head to meet his gaze. She found herself looking him up and down. She felt her body reacting to his gaze and her mind reeled from its intense lightening. It made her dizzy.</p> <p>"I like this," she said as it registered with him that everything was a blur. "You look like you're in a dream after a tough day...you look so nice." He looked at her as if he could read her thoughts. "I never imagined anyone looking so incredibly strong and strong in all his years," she admitted.</p> <p>His eyes were so intense that she felt light headed. He didn't blink but instead concentrated on her with his eyes. Their intensity grew until it felt almost like he could read through the light of her eyes. She felt his gaze lift her gaze from his and stare into hers. Then his hand was on the small of her neck. It moved up the side of her neck. She heard a small yelp escape her lips and she shivered slightly. He seemed to read this reaction more than her body.</p> <p>He moved his hand up her neck to her ear. "Don't worry." He whispered, "we have plenty to take care of tonight." He pulled her earlobe into his mouth. He gently sucked on it. The pain and pleasure she got from the tenderness of it took away from the experience of having been used as a toy. All that he could feel from the tenderness of it was a tingly feeling.</p> <p>"Mmmm." She could feel the pleasure that he was giving her. Her body felt good. He had to wonder about every nook and cranny in her body. "Mmmm...yes...yes..." She tried to speak but the words could come at a great expense. He had found a new passion and she enjoyed it. His fingers felt so warm against her skin. He felt her head rest against his chest. It was an experience to hear her breathing and the soft noises of a woman enjoying her pleasure.</p> <p>"Mmm...good," she managed to force the words out before all pain and misery could be heard. She tried to sit upright but her eyes held the world around her. The world had shifted. Her body was becoming a thing of its own. She had a new way of feeling pleasure she wanted to feel. "I'm not sure I can talk, I'm getting faint."</p> <p>He put a finger to his lip and kissed it. "I'm in a dream, my beautiful woman." He kissed her cheek and kissed her forehead. "You look so much like you do in the dream. It was so sexy in there watching you." He ran his fingers across her lips through the light from the moonlight. With his tongue now touching hers, he gently explored her mouth. She felt herself responding. A moment after he pulled away from her she felt her body respond. She felt her heart begin to beat faster, her nipples become harder and her clit begin to throb.</p> <p>"This is so exciting..." She whispered as his hand touched her breast. "My body feels so good," she confessed in a breathy whisper. His hand touched her breast again but this time it was a different kind of sensation. His fingers moved along her chest. First one hand then the other. His fingers moved around one nipple at a time. This time her gasp was more than the faintest moan that she could manage. Her chest was rising and falling faster. His fingers moved from one breast to the other sending a current flowing through her body. She began to feel a heat between her legs. He took no more notice than when he had touched her. Her hands went back to her breasts.</p> <p>She pulled the blanket off of the head rest, exposing him to the gentle light of the moon. She ran her hands along his chest and watched as his skin grew hot and tingly with blood. She began to unbutton his shirt, sliding it off his shoulders and over his arms. She began to unbutton his shirt as he ran the fingers of his hand down her stomach. "Mmm my eyes have never been opened so fast while having a dream," she breathed. Both hands went to the button of his shorts. With one slow move he pushed the shorts and shorts down his body until they fell around his ankles.</p> <p>He smiled down at her as he ran his hands across her body. "You're so beautiful." He said looking down at her. "Your eyes open so much, so much," he said as he ran his finger tip all along the sides of her face. He kissed her gently. One finger moved back and forth across herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
