I wasn't sure how much more of this this could go on.</p> <p>"We sure can do that. I will be over in a little bit and we can start it up. Are you up for that?"</p> <p>"I can't wait, I can't wait, I'm so horny already!"</p> <p>"Me too, it'll have to do with some new experiences to have fun, though I have a feeling you're going to be doing a lot of things."</p> <p>"Just remember if you get pregnant or get old and we've just finished a long-term relationship we don't have anything to do tonight. Just be your own man if you want to make love to her until she gives you permission, you can be the ultimate man for her. We can wait until we see where she goes with it," I promised.</p> <p>"Hmmm, maybe we should just go back to the restaurant and talk. When is that going to be?"</p> <p>"Well I've told her all about the threesome so I think that's up to you. I'm sure you won't get mad if she does get your son's wife pregnant. It's probably just one more possibility but I have a feeling it'll be something amazing."</p> <p>"You have no idea!"</p> <p>Heather was the same way and although I didn't fully believe it, I would have bet my life if the opportunity was presented to me right about now. I couldn't think of any better way to start off a threesome and I didn't know how to do it without risking taking his mother's unborn child and having it fall in our hands. So I agreed with him.</p> <p>We went back to the restaurant and headed into the parking lot. I had only gotten there about a block before the valet brought me in. This was his chance and I knew Heather wouldn't object. Her dress was still on.</p> <p>There was a small park next to the restaurant and Heather parked the car in front. The valet got out and opened his door. He got out of the car. Heather opened her door and walked around the car so he could get on with her. Then she stepped out and put her arms around his neck and gave him a big kiss.</p> <p>"Honey are you sure you want to do this? Are we going to have our baby?"</p> <p>I was still at a lost for words.</p> <p>"I don't know if this means life to you or maybe the couple. I just know we will go through with it and if it doesn't ruin our life then we can stop now. It's just to be sure."</p> <p>Heather broke our eye contact. She kissed him again but this time her lips were just a little bit shorter than before. She gave me an odd look this time.</p> <p>"Are you sure you won't get mad if I give you permission to have me with Mike and his friend at the same time?"</p> <p>I was still in shock from our meeting and Heather's proposal of what went on in our bedroom.</p> <p>"Baby you said you were so turned on. What can I do?" I asked.</p> <p>Heather and Mike were in the driver's seat of the SUV. She had moved the car into a more romantic setting so that we could play our love games with the possibility of a threesome.</p> <p>We went to the restaurant and sat down in one of the booths. I was trying not to look at Heather's face, which had to be one of the better ones on this vehicle.</p> <p>"This is our second time here. The other is the last place a husband and wife likes to be with strangers."</p> <p>A couple of glasses of wine had a pleasant and fruity flavor to it. I watched Heather looking out the window and when she spoke the next few words, I almost believed the rest of the conversation would be the same. She looked at me and gave me a sexy smile.</p> <p>"Baby, we'd been here almost two hours and I really have to go or you'll miss some class. Would it be okay if we went back to my place so we can take a shower together and then you can take me to bed."</p> <p>"Do you want to wait a little longer?"</p> <p>"That's okay. I don't usually like showering with a guy. It feels so sexy when they wash each other's backs."</p> <p>"Honey there is nothing hotter than washing a girl's behind. So you really don't mind if we go ahead?" That statement was more direct and it did seem as if Heather wanted to continueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
