With her face buried in the pillow, her ass in the air and her pussy completely on display, it was all she could think of. All she could do is wait for the inevitable and give herself to whatever it was.</p> <p>But the moment passed.</p> <p>Liz opened her eyes and saw a cock protruding from the pillow. It was long, but at least not as long as her own. She had only dreamed of a penis and had only fantasized about it being the object of her desire during the last couple of months. It was hard, but it was not too bad. It really could have been an inch or so longer than she realized and if it was thick, it might be very nice too.</p> <p>She had always been afraid it would split her when she reached puberty so the fear remained. On the other hand it was thick and was certainly not that big. It didn't seem to make her nervous at all. It just sort of seemed to enjoy the thought of being able to get herself fucked in this position. And the idea of a cock in there for her to try out for herself excited her greatly as much as it did being able to get herself fucked.</p> <p>"Good girl" he growled at her. "I promise we'll take our time."</p> <p>Liz looked up at the man in the black leather. She could not believe her eyes. She couldn't believe the words they were saying aloud but she couldn't believe that she was nodding her head and agreeing with whatever he wanted. Her husband was no longer watching her. She was kneeling with her ass in the air, her head bowed and her eyes to the floor waiting to be used by someone else.</p> <p>"That's a good girl," was all he said.</p> <p>He reached up and grabbed a fistful of her hair, forcing her to look at his face. He was staring at her from behind her.</p> <p>"What are you, Liz?" he hissed in her ear. "What do you think you're doing?"</p> <p>Liz looked back up at him. She knew she had to get his cock in her mouth, she knew she had to suck its cock. She was willing to do anything to get the job done. If she could just get her mouth on him just once more, she would get her mouth on him and, by doing so, she might get his come into her. Maybe she would be able to get it in her mouth before he came in her. It might be worth it though. At the very least, it might just be better than waiting any longer for a good fuck.</p> <p>"Suck my cock," she said, her pussy throbbing against her panties. "Come on, suck it."</p> <p>"That's my girl," he said, his voice stern as his thumb gently rolled the back of her neck. He leaned in and sucked her earlobe hard, his head turning from side to side slightly as he did so.</p> <p>"Take it slut," he growled, his voice loud in the silence of the room. He squeezed the small of her back, her body arching backward against his hand which was kneading her hair.</p> <p>"What do you want?" he growled, lifting his voice to her lips to make her reply. "You want to suck my dick."</p> <p>Liz could see the look in his eyes. He had lost control, his face turning from furious to a mask of lust.</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "Yes I want to."</p> <p>"I said, suck my cock. Suck it till I come in your mouth", his voice echoed behind her and Liz thought momentarily that he might make her do the exact thing she had to do just once and then she was going to take him. But she would not.</p> <p>There was no need for that.</p> <p>For once she was ready for it, because she had to suck his cock. Yes, it was going to be painful, but that would have to be for his pleasure rather than hers. There was more to it. She felt a hot pressure at her pussy as she leaned forward. No, that isn't right. It shouldn't be, but it did.</p> <p>"Oh my god" he moaned in surprise. "Oh my god. Just fuck me. Make me come."</p> <p>Liz couldn't speak, but she was not having any trouble expressing her consent. She was excited beyond belief. She felt dizzy with desire and fear. She was excited beyond belief. She wanted to suck his dick. She wanted to taste his come in her mouth.</p> <p>She opened her mouth, letting it fall open, and wrapped her lips around theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
