I didn't expect anything else, not at all, but then I had no idea I might have been ready even for this. I hadn't even been aware before, and I never would, that we were friends, and that we would be together, like lovers, the night we did it ourselves, just the two of us for Christmas. There was just no way of being anything else. I guess I could take that promise to heart.</p> <p>We set the champagne glasses on a bed of ice, grabbed glasses and went outside and I sat down beside him. He wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. It didn't take much coaxing and a long, soft kiss to get us both so excited. I had never felt as aroused as I certainly did after I had had a glass of champagne with his mother. I loved it, even thought I might be making that up.</p> <p>I broke the kiss and sat there, watching his blue eyes as he watched my eyes as I looked at the water that had drained down the drain. I had my doubts about whether or not he would want it anymore, but then I saw why he'd given me that glass and I wasn't having any doubts.</p> <p>He lifted his glass and took a sip of the chilled brandy. I reached over, gently taking his glass from him.</p> <p>"So I guess I better get back to the kitchen," I chuckled, and took a sip and added a little wiggle. He was such a sweet guy. And we both felt pretty good about sharing the wine, too. I didn't usually do that.</p> <p>We finished the wine, and put our glasses back on the table. We kissed softly, each of us a little embarrassed in so doing it, but we were happy again. I was glad to have it, and I knew I would be able to be more like us now.</p> <p>He reached down and pulled off my shoes. I lifted my foot so he could remove my sock. He kissed my ankle and slowly worked his way up to my calf. I wasn't wearing shoes. I was a bit uneasy about that, since the light summer dress would really get my legs covered, but when he moved up my calf and down over my thigh it didn't seem like too much of a problem. I was looking forward to tomorrow.</p> <p>He moved up to take my hand and kiss the tips of my fingers. The last thing I wanted to do was put on just any of my shoes, so we finished our drinks and just stared at each other. I couldn't believe my eyes.</p> <p>"You okay?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh, absolutely," I smiled, and ran my finger through his thick dark hair, and down his jaw to the point where he was looking down at me. "Go on. There's nothing wrong with having a little sexual experience."</p> <p>"You're right. The whole experience is sex, right?" He nodded. "Come on, give me a kiss, I need to kiss you again before I leave tonight."</p> <p>"I know," I said, and kissed his lips. I had never kissed him so passionately before.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said. He returned the kiss and I could tell he was feeling it too. He pulled back just slightly and looked into my eyes. Something in them, like an inner smile, which I could tell was a bit of both, but he held his tongue out at me like a snake.</p> <p>"You're very welcome," he chuckled, and kissed me again. This time we didn't kiss like teenagers, but rather held the other with lips and tongues dancing in each other's mouth. It was a sweet kiss, and my hands went to his face and I caressed his stubbly chin, kissed his lips. Before we knew it we were in each other's arms, and he was kissing me like a mad man.</p> <p>This kiss was more urgent, more loving, and I liked that. I hadn't thought I could feel so strongly, so passionately, but now I knew that I felt the same way. It wasn't the physical feelings, but the feelings I was feeling with it. I loved this kiss, too, and in turn, I loved the way he kissed me back, the way he kissed me the way he really knew I liked it, like we were a pair of teenagers again. I think that's what made it so much more special than some of the other times we had spent together.</p> <p>He pulled away from the kiss and looked into my eyes again.</p> <p>"You don't have to leave your wife, do you?"</p> <p>"Nah. I'm not going to marry anyone. What about your son?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not going to marry the guy," he grinned. "I was in a committed relationship before I married youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
