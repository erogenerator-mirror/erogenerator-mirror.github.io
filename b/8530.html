A voice echoed from the depths of the room like a hammer. "I think we need to go again, or this will be an ugly ordeal!"</p> <p>Hank's eyes flashed at that and his mouth twisted onto the edge of his own. "What do you mean, by that?" He said, in an offhand manner. "I saw the pictures of the girls again yesterday!"</p> <p>The man's teeth bit into the arm of his robe and his hips began to thrust, his hands going into his robe's sleeve to pull it tighter around his body. He looked down at the man's eyes, noting the way they grew dark with desire. He was already hard as granite.</p> <p>"Oh God! Yes," the man moaned. "I knew you would be beautiful! I thought I would have you the night I met you, but you are just as hot as ever!"</p> <p>"You...you...got...me," he stammered, blushing with embarrassment at the memory.</p> <p>The man stood up and his hips rose away until he was standing between the table legs. The man bent his knees, and pushed his hips forward, his hardness now hard, pointed through his robe and into the man's body. He gasped at the pleasure as it spread up through him. The man raised both his hands to where they reached the man's shoulders, and held him to him. Suddenly, his hips thrust back and forth and suddenly, the man knew he was going to cum. The second thrust brought another moan and with a groan and deep groan the man's hips jerked, and he began to spurt his load, into the stranger's body which convulsed around him as the man's hips thrust again and again as wave after wave of pleasure washed over him.</p> <p>When the man finally came, he held the man close, kissing the lips and neck. The man's arms went loose and he dropped the robe as he collapsed against Hank, his chest heaving and his heart beating so hard it was his neck. As the man's breathing began to slow, he felt his own orgasm begin. He groaned and gasped as it rushed through him to come to a conclusion where he had nothing to hold on to. His legs shook and he was nearly falling off the table, but he clutched the man tight and didn't let go.</p> <p>The man's erection had subsided, and Hank was just lying in the man's arms, his own penis soft and semi-erect but still hard.</p> <p>"Mmmm...that was nice," the man said, running a fingertip up and down his cheek and around the lips. "That was beautiful..."</p> <p>The man moved back, his cock slipping from the man's body and leaving soft skin behind. He leaned over and kissed the man's hand, then slowly turned and looked into the eyes of the man who was still panting as his hardness slowly returned to it's softness.</p> <p>"Thank you," the man whispered. "That was like nothing before, but I...I'm not sure I can describe the feeling of pleasure you're giving me. I haven't had an orgasm like that for a long time, and...I don't think I can..."</p> <p>Hank, suddenly aware he was naked, pulled his pants and shirt off and began to get dressedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
