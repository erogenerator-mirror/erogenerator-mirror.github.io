"What?" she said.</p> <p>"Great."</p> <p>"And you, what?"</p> <p>"Oh it was fantastic."</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>"I've never done anything like that before," she said.</p> <p>"And you're not just doing it out of gratitude," he said.</p> <p>"I know. I just have my head down."</p> <p>He laughed at her comment and then looked at the clock.</p> <p>"How much does it cost us?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well, my dad used to come and go as he was sick," she said.</p> <p>"And you still can't see the rest of the world, right?"</p> <p>As they left the gym, he noticed the clock next to the door. He frowned. It was getting late.</p> <p>"Are you going to get your car?" she asked.</p> <p>She saw his frown. "I don't know. It's my workout," she said as she pulled the door shut behind her.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"Come on, we're going home."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, walking with her.</p> <p>"I want all the people in my family to have a good time."</p> <p>"And me too."</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>"You're home," she said.</p> <p>He stopped walking into her door. "So, you want to go up to your condo tonight?"</p> <p>"Not if I can be honest," she said. "I'm not ready at all for it to happen yet but, yeah, okay. I'm going to."</p> <p>"I'll pick you up around seven."</p> <p>"How?" she asked, her voice flat.</p> <p>"The place is just around the corner. I'll pick you up, okay?"</p> <p>"I understand that, but I don't understand why you want to stop there," she said while closing her door.</p> <p>He laughed. "What I have to explain to you then is very interesting."</p> <p>"Okay," she said while she walked down the stairs.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>"So when do you want to meet?" she said.</p> <p>"Soon."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll be at your place all weekend, but I'll be by myself tonight. Have a good time."</p> <p>As she sat at the table, she thought about what an incredible guy he was. He was smart, funny and funny even though he had none of those qualities. She wanted him, he really wanted her and he also saw her in a million different ways. She laughed to herself as she recalled the moment when she saw him smile and say he liked it when she looked at him.</p> <p>She felt herself get wet as she thought about what it would be like to be with him.</p> <p>He came to her at 6:00 PM and took her hand in his. "I want you to really want to be with me, baby."</p> <p>"I need to be with you," she said as she smiled.</p> <p>"Good. Take off your clothes, put your robe on, and wait," he said as he pulled her to him for a kiss.</p> <p>He was wearing black boxers and they hugged and she felt his bulging muscles pressed up against her butt. She leaned back against him, smiling at him. She got a little dizzy and felt him move around quickly. He came up and she wrapped herself around him and kissed him passionately. He pulled his hands down her back and squeezed her butt.</p> <p>He broke the kiss and asked her to get on the bed. She got the sheets off the bed and he moved one to the side of the bed then went to the window to see if he could tell if she was okay. She watched him as she pulled her robe off one button at a time. He pulled the robe off and tossed it at her and tossed it away. She was naked underneath her robe. As he watched her, he felt a throbbing and getting hard.</p> <p>She smiled at him.</p> <p>"Go to the bathroom and turn on the shower."</p> <p>As he walked to the bathroom, she slid the robe off and walked down the hall. When she came back into the bedroom, she dropped the robe and put it on the bed.
