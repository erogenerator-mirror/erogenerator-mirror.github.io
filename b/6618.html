I had to think of something. At the same time, I also liked thinking about other people. As soon as I could, I went to bed that night, but I had to wait.</p> <p>I was getting hotter and hotter at night and my thoughts were constantly about her. I thought of what I'd like to do to her, and what I'd do even more. I just couldn't help myself. I began masturbating, picturing her. She would be dressed in that sheer, skimpy nightie, but I'd never see her. Not in person anyway. I couldn't do it to her. I couldn't do it to anyone, let her know I had feelings for her. She would laugh and I'd tell her she had no idea.</p> <p>But there was something else. Something more intense.</p> <p>I thought back to all the times she'd flashed her boobs to me. I thought of her looking down my dress, and she could have seen that. That is, I thought she was checking out my breasts. I was imagining her standing before me with her hands on my tits, squeezing them. It was kind of exciting because every time she passed by my room, her hands would be all over me, but when she left, she would be walking right to her room to do it again.</p> <p>Now, maybe I was too much of a perv.</p> <p>I kept picturing her and her big breasts as she walked down the hallway after getting out of classes. She'd take off her panties and spread her legs, and I'd get to kiss her pussy, while rubbing myself.</p> <p>And finally she got out of class that afternoon. She wasn't a little girl anymore. She was a woman in her thirties, and she got to be the best looking woman in town if that's who you wanted. I was glad she had that in her.</p> <p>But we really only had one day together...maybe it wouldn't be enough. But what did I really have to do to get her to do something else? I knew it had to be on Monday. It had to be in the middle of the week.</p> <p>It was the middle of the week and we were talking for a bit, then she told me she hadn't had any sex for a month!</p> <p>I took back a lot of it. It was my fault. I should just blame her for it. I should have warned her. She'd said she was ready to be with me, didn't she? She could have been with anyone just because of my work or other circumstances. No, it was my fault and I would blame her.</p> <p>A week passed. I was just about out of ideas, and she said she couldn't work Monday. That would be too late. I had to think through the situation. What the hell was I going to say? And why, in the middle of the night, would she be waiting for me in her room?</p> <p>The next day, I got up to write her a note. It read:</p> <p>Dear Diary,</p> <p>Thank you for such a wonderful sexual evening, I hope you are as horny as I am!</p> <p>I have done one more thing for you.</p> <p>I wish you all the good times,</p> <p>Elle</p> <p>I knew I looked good, but all I could think about was what was on that note.</p> <p>We did that for a while. The day came and it was a beautiful afternoon. I sat in that office, listening to my kids playing in the sandbox under a shade tree. I think that's why she never came by. She did want to think about my husband.</p> <p>The afternoon passed smoothly. I was getting more nervous and excited by day thinking about what was to happen the next day. And I still couldn't believe she wasn't actually having sex for a month!</p> <p>For the rest of the day I just couldn't believe it. I got so turned on because of her flirty conversation. I had no idea what she thought of that. She was just telling me what to expect. I know I was nervous and scared, but I just couldn't get it out of my head.</p> <p>At one point, I had to come up in front of her desk because my legs shook. I took every chance to get my hand down my panties.</p> <p>A couple of days passed by and I was getting into a rhythm. When I knew she was getting ready to leave, I would put my hand inside of my panties and just rub my clit, thinking about what I would do to her.</p> <p>A couple of mornings later, I saw that she was walking out of the office and I could swear I could see her nipples standing at full attention through herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
