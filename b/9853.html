He asked her.</p> <p>"Nay I didn't. And she didn't know."</p> <p>"What did she tell you?"</p> <p>"Nothing! How old are you?"</p> <p>"Sixteen."</p> <p>"You're a great kid."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"I just wanted to know what you saw."</p> <p>"Don't be too hard on yourself, kid." He said.</p> <p>"I saw it!"</p> <p>"Ain't no, kid! But your mother saw too! I'm sorry, kid."</p> <p>She gave him a kiss on the cheek and walked away. He sat there for a while thinking about what he had seen and why it bothered him. Finally, he got up and picked up some paper from the counter, threw it back, and started to walk out.</p> <p>"Wait!" He called.</p> <p>He stopped and looked and looked but he couldn't see anything. He walked out the door and tried to talk to her but she waved him on. He ran out and ran in the other direction. He looked back for a little while to see her sitting at her desk, with her head down, just staring at the computer screen. Finally, he walked up to her desk to apologize to her and she turned and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Where were you again, boy? How long was I out?"</p> <p>"Just a few minutes," he said.</p> <p>"Where were you?" She was still sitting there like she was in the bathroom.</p> <p>"Just a few minutes."</p> <p>"What was you saying?" The questions came in as one long question, as if she had just had a bad day or something.</p> <p>"You don't remember me?"</p> <p>"No, don't ask, please ask."</p> <p>"Come with me." He walked off of her desk and she walked in the office to get some papers. A minute later, she came out with a folder. She said something in her mind, then put the folder down and looked it over again, only to see her face.</p> <p>"What?" She looked at him for a long time and then told him the truth.</p> <p>"He saw me!" he exclaimed. "He saw you!"</p> <p>She was looking at him and she smiled and then looked back at the computer screen. "Why?" She asked.</p> <p>"Because I'm a dumb idiot."</p> <p>"And you're a dumb idiot who gets off on being told what to do!"</p> <p>"No!" He shouted. "I don't want to believe you!" He said and slapped himself.</p> <p>Then he looked at her and asked if she was okay. He then looked at her as he said it, "I'm sorry, you're a dumb idiot. That's not fair. I wanted to give you a kiss on the cheek, so if you would like to, you could kiss my cheek."</p> <p>"No." She said, standing up.</p> <p>"Of course you can! I've kissed your cheek many times before. But not like this! It would be so wrong of me, but it turns you on. You want to kiss my cheek."</p> <p>"No! You can't kiss my cheek!" she insisted.</p> <p>"Then you don't want me to kiss my cheeks, so you'll just have to kiss my lips for a while."</p> <p>"No, I can't! I'm just not allowed!" She said and went to walk away.</p> <p>"I'm not letting go!"</p> <p>"Can't you kiss it, just like you kissed my lips?"</p> <p>"I just can't," he explained and then he looked at her and asked if he could kiss her lips.</p> <p>In a split second, she thought she caught fire. She felt a little silly, but she couldn't stop it. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth and then closed it and kissed the skin of his mouth, his lips, his lips. That was probably a good kiss, he told her. She closed her eyes again and felt her heart rate quicken. She felt a chill in the air, which she guessed to be the temperature in the office. Finally, she felt the warmth rush through her, and she felt the pressure of desire build. Finally, she pulled down and kissed the inside part of his lips. She felt his tongue dart out and touch her inner lip. She felt him pull back and the kiss ended.</p> <p>"You made me want to kiss you," she said. "Kiss your lips."</p> <p>She felt his arms go around her and then he held her back, forcing her to feel his lips on hers. That was an amazing kiss. He pulled away first and then he was on his knees kissing her face and then moved the hands off her body and moved her arms up.
