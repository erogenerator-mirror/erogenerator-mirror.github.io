It's better to take everything from you than to feel it being stolen from us, and you have to give me something to cling on to so we can live comfortably."</p> <p>He nodded and held me closely, "I'll get rid of it, I promise."</p> <p>"You're right," I nodded, "Thank you for everything. You had to give me everything I thought I could ever want or need."</p> <p>He held me closer to him, and I could feel a trickle of warm milk on his body and his cock, "Thank you," he said.</p> <p>I held him tight and kissed him softly. "I'll see that I was wrong." I kissed him again.</p> <p>He grinned at me as he pulled off his clothes. "Come to the bedroom, its time for me to be inside you."</p> <p>I nodded and walked to his bedroom. I laid on the bed with my head on the pillow and waited for him to come and get me, and I heard the bed creak as he got in the bed beside me. Within seconds he was hard and sliding inside me making me cum. I moaned his name and pushed back at him, "Don't stop, please don't, don't stop." He started moving slowly. "Baby, will you marry me?"</p> <p>I nodded and he grabbed a hold of my hand and started to slide in and out again, "Please, yes, honey... just like that," I squeezed my legs tight around his body, my arms and shoulders wrapped around him.</p> <p>"What did you say to me?" he moaned, and I nodded.</p> <p>"Oh, I'll marry you, I love you," I cried.</p> <p>"And I love you, too," he said, sliding faster. I could feel him start to thrust harder and faster, I was moaning uncontrollably, and he grabbed my wrists and pulled them away from my body, and we both reached for the other to join us, "Don't stop, honey, please don't stop." He cried and thrust a few more times before he thrust back hard and came. I came right after him and then again around him. I could feel my pussy spasm and squeeze around him. My own body was trembling.</p> <p>He was panting and he rolled over next to me. I snuggled against him, and he stroked my hair and his shoulder, and I held his face and kissed it. I smiled and kissed his mouth, the tip of his nose, and he hugged me tight.</p> <p>"Did you love me?" he asked.</p> <p>I nodded. "Yes, and I don't ever hate you for what you did to me," I said, and he grinned and hugged me more. He caressed me once more as he started to fall asleep, and I slept.</p> <p>I woke up and was getting up when I felt something inside me move, "Baby," I moaned, and I felt him press against my back for a moment; then I felt him press against me and pull me in and press his cock tight against me again. He held my hands over my head with his to stop my movement but the sensation felt heavenly as I felt the end of his shaft slide along the inside of my slit. "Fuck me," I moaned.</p> <p>"Fuck me," he echoed me. "My cock and your pussy belong to me now," he answered as he pushed deep, and I felt myself stretch to fit around him. It was heaven feeling the warmth of him inside as I was filled. "You're so tight, baby," he groaned after awhile, "I'm going to be in the mood when we do it again."</p> <p>I heard him moan my name again; and he pulled out, I thought I would come again, but I was too sore and couldn't. My pussy had just been full of his cum for a lifetime and if he still wanted me I didn't care. He was gentle, yet he knew what he liked too, and he knew to let her have her way with me before you get all upset.</p> <p>He was moving easily inside of her and he was holding himself up on his elbows. She moaned as he moved inside of her. "Your pussy's so fucking tight, baby," he groaned. "I love filling you up," he whispered in my ear. He lifted up and dropped me on the bed.</p> <p>He kissed my shoulder as he moved inside me again. "I'm your husband, baby," he whispered. "Your pussy's yours; you're mine, baby. Take me, please take me," he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
