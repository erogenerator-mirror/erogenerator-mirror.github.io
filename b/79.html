That's really nice. Just keep going."</p> <p>I slid one of my fingers inside her and felt her clench it. There was no response - she was still asleep. I slowly withdrew my finger and then gently pushed it back into her, then out and back in again. I worked it back and forth. When she opened her eyes, I saw that she was squirming and breathing hard. I started to move my hips in a more familiar way and she responded.</p> <p>"Ohh...that feels nice. Ohh, your finger feels nice."</p> <p>I increased the pace, working my finger faster as I felt her hips starting to move, and then suddenly stopped. When I looked back at her face, her face was peaceful. She opened her eyes and looked at me again...and then we kissed again. Her lips were soft and warm, and the kiss she gave me was like I've never felt.</p> <p>I slid my hand from her body and began lightly stroking her breast again, and I was rewarded by a deep sigh of gratitude - she had to have felt my erection, even more than usual, because it felt like a steel bar on my body. I squeezed her breast a little harder and felt it tighten a little when I felt her nipple twitch. I started to massage and pinch it and I heard a little moan.</p> <p>"I want to taste you", I breathed, and she raised her face towards my face. I bent my head towards it and as she opened her mouth for a kiss, I flicked her tongue delicately over it. When she did it for me, I pressed my mouth firmly to hers. I felt her body shudder as she drew closer to me. I held her tight as I brought my lips close to her lips - when I did, she drew me against her mouth and I felt her tongue press against my lips. I opened my mouth, letting her tongue slip past her lips, but when I closed my mouth and slid my tongue, she moaned and opened her mouth, opening her mouth and letting me enter - and then it opened again, sliding over my tongue and into her mouth. I pushed my tongue further into her mouth and felt her tongue press against mine. She was really enjoying herself; I felt so good when she liked that.</p> <p>When my tongue touched hers, she moved even closer and I was now pressing my erection against her body. My hand slipped lower - I felt her belly, her breasts, her nipples. She felt my cock and reached her hand down to grab it. I felt it, too, and she squeezed my cock, not too tightly and I felt her smile as she looked at it.</p> <p>We kissed again, more urgently - I felt her hand move closer to my cock and she touched at it again. I had another thought - I turned my head back, my mouth still on hers, and slipped my fingers around the rim of her pussy. Her eyes were closed and she was moving her hips towards me, but I felt her hand grab my shaft again, so I just pushed it against her bottom, just a little, and she opened her eyes.</p> <p>We kissed again. I could feel that she knew what I was doing now; she just touched it and I went with it. I pressed my tongue to hers and heard the liquid of hers gush onto mine as we kissed; then I slipped my tongue in her mouth and it went into hers; my hand held her breast and all of a sudden, our tongues were in each others mouths. I held her as she held my hands to her breasts, not just her nipples, but also her stomach. Her body was warm and I could feel her breasts against mine. I was ready to carry on, but she wasn't ready to let me stop and we kissed some more.</p> <p>She had her hand under the hair of my head now, gently but firmly stroking my hair and her kisses were softer. She was moaning - almost as if she was enjoying it as much as I was. I slipped my hand down and cupped her bottom in my hand, feeling her leg lift slightly, and lifted from the lounge. This time, she didn't stop me and I slid it down, pressing my palm against her pussy and feeling her legs part just a little bit. I slid my finger down between her legs, up between hers, pressing against her entrance. She was dripping; she really was wet.</p> <p>"I want to feel you here," I told her and she lifted herself just a little to let me in her body, then held on to my cock. I felt her hand grasp at the tip and pull on it, just a little bit as she felt the hardness and moved her hand further around me.</p> <p>It felt nice and warm, so soft. She kissed me again and took my cock in her hand again.</p> <p>"I want to taste you".</p> <p>We kissed again and parted ourselves for anotherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
