He had a smile on his face which I quickly caught on. He had never seen a guy get off on a cocksucking, and was enjoying it. When he got down on all fours his face had gotten even more turned on by what he'd been thinking about. He could see my wet pussy and smiled. He had never seen a woman do that just as obviously. I was a little embarrassed that I was letting him know what I was. I'd gone through a lot after having my husband fuck one of my girlfriends for the first time for over three weeks now.</p> <p>He turned to look at me. He was grinning from ear to ear. He leaned forward and put his hand near my face. He looked me in the eyes and said "I want to taste you!". I looked back at him and got a big smile as he slid his tongue inside me and licked all around my pussy. After a few minutes of licking and fingering he moved to get in front of me.</p> <p>Once his tongue found mine he started moving his head from side to side as he started eating me. He moved back to my clit and started rubbing it with his thumb. When he reached down to rub my nipples he stopped and pulled his head up and said "Oh my God." He got on his knees in front of me and started kissing me again. I was really enjoying it. I pulled away from him briefly as he continued kissing down my body. He quickly looked and noticed the bulge he'd gotten when he looked down at me last night. "Oh no, you're not that," he said "Just go slow!" I leaned into the couch with my legs spread and leaned into him. He kissed me and then slid down to my clit. He slowly licked the hood before sticking his tongue inside me. He kept licking and sucking until I was about to cum and he knew where to go. He moved his head down and started licking my clit again.</p> <p>I could feel the orgasm build as it was building inside me. My pussy started to tighten. I threw my head back and screamed "Oh my God." He held onto me and slowed down as I tried to enjoy it. He pulled off my clit and kissed up my stomach while I came. I saw a smile on his face as I caught my breath.</p> <p>He pulled off his shorts and underwear and I saw him naked. His cock was pointing straight at me. He started pushing into my pussy and slowly thrust it in and out. He took his cock out of my pussy and started rubbing a finger over my clit. I started coming again but felt like he was getting better. He slowly started moving his cock in and out, in and out. This took over a minute and his cock filled me completely. Finally he could go no more and he did the same with his cock in and out. He was going harder and faster every time. He didn't hold back and came again. He pulled out and climbed onto my face and I was quickly licking his cum off his balls and in my mouth. It was the most erotic thing I'd ever experience. It was all over my face and neck, neck and hair. He climbed off me and sat down at the edge of the couch again, his cock was dripping and I could see it getting hard again. I got up and looked at it. It was a little smaller than I remember.</p> <p>I got on my knees and took a big glob of cum right on my tits. I massaged them with the gooey sperm and watched it ooze out. I went back to my pussy and rubbed the cum into my tits. I then got off the couch and got on my back again and spread my legs apart. My legs were high in the air as I started rubbing my clit. He crawled down my legs and got up on his knees between them. He leaned forward and slowly slid his cock inside me. The angle made it hard to be straight, but I was going over the edge again and soon he was slamming into me with everything he had. I could feel his balls hitting my ass. He looked at me.</p> <p>I saw his face contort in a deep expression of pleasure and desire. His head went back and my pussy squeezed down on the hard cock inside me. He thrust up and out faster and faster. Just as I was getting so close to my orgasm he started to shake. He was cumming in me. He groaned and I felt the warm flood of his cum flood inside me. He collapsed on me and we held each other. We kissed and rested a minute.</p> <p>We cleaned ourselves up, took a shower, and went to bed. He woke up and spooned behind me. It brought back the memories of his first blow job of the night before. We'd been fucking for a week, and he was still on his best behavior.
