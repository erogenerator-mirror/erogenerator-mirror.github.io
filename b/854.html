I shrugged, "I kind of like being on your site."</p> <p>"Yeh." She said, looking me over again. "You do? You like looking at me? I know I do. Now move your arms..."</p> <p>I stood up and removed my jacket, still staring at her. My breasts had swollen with milk due to my excitement, my nipples were hard and pointing down, which made her smile even more. "I'm a big girl. And..." I took a deep breath. "And now I have to...well, I've wanted to see you for a long time. When you came. How you're doing? Did you like what you saw?"</p> <p>She smiled, as if she were pleased with herself, "Well... I liked it... actually I did."</p> <p>"And what about you, you know. How's your..."</p> <p>"Well, I have a boyfriend." She grinned. "I got his number, last night, and he's been fucking my sister for some time. I haven't been with anyone for a long time."</p> <p>"You're kidding, right? You're kidding about what his number looked like?"</p> <p>She shook her head with a shrug of the shoulders. "Well, I guess I'm getting there."</p> <p>"Well, you could do that to me any time." My voice turned more serious. "Anyway, since this has got to be your secret website and you've got to make it my secret site, I guess you'd better go ahead."</p> <p>"Is... am I going to have to... say something about this?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"If I did it, you'd really go to hell!"</p> <p>"I don't care! It's a big deal, don't you think?"</p> <p>She shook her head. "No!" She sighed, "I don't know if I want to share my secrets with anyone. This whole thing is kinda crazy, and I'm not a lesbian. Just because I made a friend in college, it's really a big deal. I mean, I've gotta think about what he said before I tell him. I mean... I mean, I'm not that kind of girl."</p> <p>"I don't mind sharing your secrets. I know he would have told you." I smiled. "Let's just say in the long term it's going to be a lot easier for him to fuck his sister."</p> <p>She paused with that last comment, looked me in the eye. "And I'm not so sure I can trust him again."</p> <p>"Look, we haven't even got to the details that are on my secret website, right?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She leaned closer, kissed my cheek. "It'll work out for you, if that'll make you feel better."</p> <p>I was surprised to hear her say that, I had wondered if she was serious about that. I'd thought that she'd just have been a bit on the strict side, although in this scenario, she'd never been a problem and I knew that she wouldn't be. This way, I just knew that she was going to take the fun out of it and I wouldn't have to make any of the moves. I smiled a little as I realized I'd been trying to push things too far.</p> <p>"What?" She looked at me funny. "What's up?"</p> <p>"I want to show you, too. I mean I can't promise anything if you don't trust me, though," I was surprised that I didn't want to do that.</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean, I thought you like being a little wilder."</p> <p>"I like sex, too, you know. I'm not so wild with it anymore. I'm getting older." She took a step towards the bathroom in the dark. "I think that you should come with me."</p> <p>"Me, how do I get there?" She took another step into the bathroom, "I just told you, I'm not sure I don't trust you."</p> <p>I stood in the darkness and watched her get in, she turned the shower on, adjusted the knobs a little, then opened the curtain and stepped into the spray. I had to admit it was a nice shower and I started to get that feeling back in my mind. I stepped out of the shower and started to dry myself off and went to the bed, sitting down on the bed.</p> <p>My eyes were drawn over the body of the girl that I'd thought I had seen a long time ago. I tried to remember her pictures, and then the face of the girl that I had thought I saw in the magazines. I couldn't believe how I was reacting to all the things that I saw of her todayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
