And I will do what it says."</p> <p>"Can you be present for a full investigation?"</p> <p>"I would have thought that the police would only need evidence from me to make a verdict." There was a pause, "And I would never want to do that." She looked towards John with a serious look, "There is nothing to prevent me, any judge, prosecution, and lawyers from having a full report of this."</p> <p>"And that you are to report in Court with the evidence."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm already there, but not before we get to all the detail for the case. And I have just the thing on my agenda. I'll do some things first and go to the lawyer, we'll go out for coffee afterwards. You know... get some work done in the workshop.</p> <p>"I can be there when you are ready. And please, use the safe word."</p> <p>"Yes, Ma'am, of course I can use anything you tell me to. Oh, I just need to speak with the lawyer again before I go out this afternoon."</p> <p>A few minutes later they were at the front gate. There was not a hint of hesitation in her movements or any doubt of anything being said by her. So he knew she was going to do just what she was told to do. He also suspected she would have already told the lawyer that.</p> <p>That afternoon at the shop, she was almost done when the door opened while he was working. She gave him a curt nod, a knowing smile, and went to the shop entrance. He had not been aware that the door had been closed. When she came back he turned it slightly so she could see that the shop was not even open. He had an idea of what had happened, but he had no immediate inkling what the reason would be.</p> <p>"You have that look." He started, "That's from a woman who likes it and thinks you'll appreciate it." A bit of an odd look. "A lot of people like it; I know. But she can't help thinking it's about time you were with a woman who will give them a proper report when you're home." He looked to Jane, "Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>Her face was serious, "Yes, I am." Her eyes were almost pleading. He knew in the last couple of years, she would take the decision and be open; even offering herself to be his. He was not sure how she would react to being with another woman. But he knew she had a thing for women, and he knew that some she might not like and some he might enjoy. There was something he also knew, and wanted to get his hands on. He knew she would do whatever it took to win her over. That made it so much more exciting, as he thought of it.</p> <p>They started up the walk from the shop in silence. He got the shop door opened while she kept looking at the sign, "We have been invited from the back. We'd like to go to the back at three thirty. And to find a suitable place, when we are ready. Please be sure to bring in your keys. It should be fine." They went through the store, each trying to decide what to wear: a pair of jeans or shorts with long sleeves and a button down shirt that would get her skirt pulled up around her shoulders. Finally, Jane came back with her keys and, again, with a curt nod, gave them to him.</p> <p>"I'll bring you down to three thirty to have a look around before the evening is over" He looked straight at her, "You might find your clothing a bit strange." He felt a little uncomfortable. "And it will be a rather pleasant evening if you are prepared to take advantage of it?"</p> <p>For the next hour they walked back to the back of the shop, which was the one they had to wait for at home. They had been back almost five hours when the front door suddenly opened and Jane came bursting in. "John, you can go home." He nodded. He had never been back home before.</p> <p>"So how am I doing?" John reached over, "Do you remember when you asked for me to find a shop here before we left?"</p> <p>She had taken a deep breath. "And you did."</p> <p>"Well, I've been in here for a while now."</p> <p>"Well, come on."</p> <p>"Let me ask you a question. I really wish I could go to the shop."</p> <p>"I'm not sure you should, but I know how your work is. We'll both have a good laugh." There was a pause, "But I can see the answer there is."</p> <p>"You haven't got to say anything." He looked around for a momentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
