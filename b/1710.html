She was nervous. "I...I am so sorry..." She broke out sobs, and sat down in front of him, crying her eyes out. "I was so nervous. I was about to tell him. It never came. It never happened."</p> <p>"Ohhhh, ohhhhh," He whispered quietly as she cried and shuddered, his head falling on her shoulder, "Shhhhhh," he his deep, his strong voice trembling, his hands kneading at her arms until she began to relax, sitting up to stroke his hands.</p> <p>"We have work tonight. We have work tomorrow, we have friends tonight..."</p> <p>He squeezed her in his arms. "We have lots of time tomorrow. I'm taking you home."</p> <p>"You have friends..." she asked softly. "What about them?"</p> <p>"Oh my," he answered, his voice cracking. "I'm going to bed...I'm coming up to my room again..." he said, smiling. "I'll be back in just a bit." He pulled her to him, hugging her as they kissed passionately.</p> <p>"Oh, my, I'm so nervous. I'm so embarrassed..."</p> <p>"Don't be. It's okay," he whispered, stroking her hair as he gently nibbled on her ear and neck. "It's okay." He put a gentle hand on her back, caressing her gently. "Now let me get you off to bed," he said, and stood. "Please go ahead..." he whispered as he helped her off her feet, and pulled her top up over her head, his hand brushing the fabric as he passed her.</p> <p>She pulled the hem of her skirt up over her hips, as she kicked her flip-flop to the other end of the table. He stood there looking at the smooth black fabric, the way the color reflected off the heat that it made, as he undid his slacks to slide off his boxers, and stood in front of her as she slid her skirt up around her waist. He kissed her as she slid the skirt down, his hand sliding into her waist as she stepped towards him to take off his socks. Her hands slipped inside his boxers and over his growing member, feeling it throb against her fingertips.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, I could just come over here and fuck you right here on this table. It's so hot in here, you are so fucking horny..." he murmured, caressing her hips, running his fingers through the short hair that had fallen over her breasts to play with her nipples, before sliding her panties down, then turning her around. Pushing her back against the table he kissed her passionately, as his hands slid up and cupped her boobs, teasing the nipples underneath. Her legs parted to let him explore her moist folds.</p> <p>"I'm going to be sooo hot, inside this table...I'm going to be soo fucking sooo hard for you..." He whispered, his hard shaft sliding against her hip again. He slid his other hand from her waist to her ass, squeezing it firmly so he could feel the smoothness through his fingers. He pressed against her, feeling her hips quiver against him. She was breathing hard, and her hands slid to the front of his pants, gently slipping into the front to stroke his length, her fingers sliding inside.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, you're so big." She breathed, leaning back farther, feeling the cool night air on her hot flesh. "Oh, I'm soooooo hot for you." She moaned, feeling his hardness press against her. She pushed back against him, feeling the pressure against her, his hardness pushing against her as they held each other.</p> <p>"You are so hot...I can't believe how hard you are." He teased, kissing her gently on the cheek and neck, feeling for more than her hand stroking him, his lips leaving hers as he cupped her cheeks.</p> <p>She pulled her hand from inside his pants and began unbuttoning him, her fingers sliding easily on his silky smooth skin.</p> <p>"Take off your pants." His voice was raspy, "Let me see what it's like for you to touch yourself with your hand." His voice was hoarse as he pulled off his shirt, and moved to lean on the table as she pulled down his pants. Reaching inside his boxers he felt himself swelling, a bead of precum now forming at the tip.</p> <p>She pulled off her own pants, sliding over the back of his calves. Her breasts were perfect, her skin flawless, as her nipples were swollen hard, almost to bursting point. He took in her entire vision, taking in every detail as she leaned to him. He began pulling at her breasts and licking at her nipples, his hands cupping them, pulling and squeezing.
