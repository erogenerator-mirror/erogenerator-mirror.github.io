She still wanted him, but she knew for sure that it would be impossible. She would just have to keep hoping. Finally realizing how her relationship with Jack was going to proceed, she got up and went looking for Jack. She saw some guy in a car pulling a car onto the driveway from his yard. She ran over to where he was.</p> <p>"Mr. Sanders," she greeted him.</p> <p>He had his head turned away when he heard her say that and turned.</p> <p>"Yeah, what's going on?" he questioned her.</p> <p>"Oh, nothing. I just forgot to tell you that if you ever want me to stop by the house, I'm on my way." She said walking over toward him.</p> <p>When the door closed, he turned back to look at her. He felt his stomach drop a bit. He knew what he had to do. He had to let her go. He could feel the warmth of his emotions seeping through his veins. He didn't have the feeling that he was ready for it now. He had to give in and let her go. He looked down and saw that his pants were very loose on him.</p> <p>He shook his head, wondering why he did that. He knew that this situation was not right, but at that point he really didn't have any choice. He was going to have to let her go. He had to do what he had to do, or he would never make her feel the things that these feelings had been for him. He knew that he had to be strong for this woman. It had to be right for him too. He did his best to not let this situation go that far. He put his hands over his face and looked up at her. He was not sure where to look. It wasn't worth it to just let her go, but as long as he let her go then he had to let her walk.</p> <p>She walked over to him and they embraced. After what seemed like hours, but turned into about 10 minutes with just as many stares from everyone around them. Finally, she broke the silence. "Mr. Sanders." She said with a smile. "I really did not mean to cause you anymore pain for asking me out like that...that it wasn't a good idea."</p> <p>"It happens all the time." He said. "If you ever need me, just let me know. Anything else that I can do for you, just let me know."</p> <p>As he stepped towards her, she gave him a hug. "See you then." He said.</p> <p>He watched as her hands stroked his cheek a couple times to get his attention. "See you then." He called to her before turning and walking away.</p> <p>He thought for a second then walked back to where he had left her and grabbed her hands. He pulled her arms away from her and forced his eyes to meet hers. "I would like to see you again." He said.</p> <p>"I wouldn't be able to go back there." She protested.</p> <p>"I know." He said. "If anyone else would, I would go with you."</p> <p>"That's wonderful!" She said. It was almost like seeing him again and her whole body went limp at the thought.</p> <p>"I'm serious." He said. "I would like to see you again." He said taking her hand to pull away from him.</p> <p>He watched as her eyes went wide when he pulled her hand away from her. "I-I want you right now!" she said without hesitation.</p> <p>He let go of her hand and watched as she let her hands slide down to her feet and walked out of the front door.</p> <p>When he heard the front door close again, he turned to face the beautiful and naked woman on the couch, the one he'd been telling everybody that he loved over and over again. He just turned and walked to the couch, which was right where he stood. He sat down in the nearest chair and pulled up his shirt off. He then got off the couch and started to undress himself. He could feel the sweat on his forehead and was about to tell her that he was sorry when the door opened out of nowhere, as he heard some shouting.</p> <p>Jack quickly ran over to the door, grabbed his bag and dashed out of the door. As he got to the door, it flung across the floor as it slammed into his head with a loud crash.</p> <p>"Is everything alright?" He heard Jack's voice say. He turned and saw Jack standing in there.</p> <p>"I hope everything is okay, but I need to ask this question and I need to clear it with you first." He had been waiting for this moment.</p> <p>"Sure." Jack said. "But when I got to the front door, this wasn't where I thought you were goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
