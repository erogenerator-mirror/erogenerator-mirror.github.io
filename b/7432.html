Her body had a small tan line from her previous exposure to the sun, and a tiny mole above her vagina.</p> <p>"I want to take you home with me. But, we can't do it right. It's too beautiful."</p> <p>"Ok," he said. Then "let's go!" he said and kissed her again. They got dressed, kissed one another goodbye, then drove over to his apartment. When they got inside, they immediately started kissing again. He had her on the couch, kissing her neck, her breasts, her stomach, then he had his hand up her skirt kissing her legs. He stopped kissing her, but kept his fingers up her cunt.</p> <p>"Hurry up and turn to face me."</p> <p>She obeyed with a smile, and he took his hand, put it over her mouth, and inserted his finger. She let it do any other action.</p> <p>"My turn."</p> <p>She was already sitting on the couch, legs spread, fingers under her skirt, fingers inside her vagina, as he put a condom on and mounted her. She took his hard cock, took it all the way inside, and started riding him. He had to stand on the couch. They fucked each other until both were weak.</p> <p>When they got to his bedroom, they were both exhausted. After a short nap, he got up to get a few glasses of wine. After having some rest, he turned on the television. She was lying asleep. They went for dinner.</p> <p>"I have to run, maybe later?"</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I promised my husband... He wants to fuck me, but I can't cheat a husband if he is sleeping. What I need is for you to come with me... And..." He kissed her...</p> <p>"Ok. I don't know what to do. We can just watch some TV and go to your bed. This time we can do it again, ok."</p> <p>The rest of the night were silent. Then she got up and he woke her with a kiss. She put on underwear and went to the living room. When they sat down, he said, "Your husband left me this night before I left for London."</p> <p>"I see. Why do we have to keep this in the dark."</p> <p>"I don't know. I have never thought about you and this... But I did it, right? He didn't just come out to bed, so I'm willing to share him again."</p> <p>"He did? Well, don't you think I should?"</p> <p>"You might be a bit too conservative for marriage, aren't you?"</p> <p>She didn't know whether to laugh, shock, or be upset. He had never said these things to her, and he was trying to make her feel comfortable. They sat at the table and drank more wine. When he had finished his second glass she ordered dinner for seven, making it two-thirds full.</p> <p>"So, do you think our marriage will survive?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm sure that we will survive. But, if we stay married, then I've got to find a way to get back to you. I told him I couldn't do it. I still love him. Then he will want you back. You will be a bit different."</p> <p>"Did he... Did he tell you, that you were a virgin?"</p> <p>"No. He made no mention about it. He just told me that it was not easy for you when people find out you are going to be with a man... and..."</p> <p>He kissed her. She wanted to resist for a second. This man was different than anyone she had ever known. Yet, she thought he felt the same about her now. She wondered if she could ever face him again. But then he told her:</p> <p>"I'm a bit drunk, so no, we will go to your bed. I'm not a sad man. I would really like to be with you tonight if we had this night to ourselves."</p> <p>And she felt him getting hard once again before they left the room. What he said was clear. She was still not sure if she could trust him, but she was willing to try. They had never done anything like that yet, and they had been friends for almost as long as her. She felt no sense of shame at all, though she was quite sure there was more they would like to do. She had never met him once, yet she was confident that he and he alone would make a good couple.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>She told him she was on her way to her husband's room as he slept in his wife's bedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
