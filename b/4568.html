My hand strode up to her right shoulder and down her arm and stopped just below her elbow. "I'm sorry, what is this about?" I asked.</p> <p>"I've missed you, John. I've just been having some trouble keeping my hands to myself."</p> <p>"Well, let's get you out of these clothes so I can get a grip." I smiled, and pushed a button on the wall. She laughed. "That little stunt on the way here might just teach me a thing or two about being a good little pet."</p> <p>She leaned on me, pressing against me. She was feeling me up. Her small tits and ass were pressed into my chest.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she murmured, in the same breath, "You do this on purpose?"</p> <p>"Well no one really knows how to do it," I told her. "Now take off your clothes and I'll get started."</p> <p>She paused. "But I'm not exactly on my best behavior."</p> <p>I reached up and slipped a finger into her hairless lips. "No, I mean, don't worry. You've got it pretty good." I pulled her head down to my lap and stroked her hair. I started kissing her neck and collarbones before moving down to her chest. She looked up at me, eyes wide with anticipation, and then I began to move my lips across her chest. I kissed one breast, then the other, before nuzzling my nose in the little cleavage my fingers could reach.</p> <p>She was looking down at me and licking her lips, then taking off her shirt, pushing it up over her torso. She threw that away on the couch and I kissed my way across her belly as I pushed her jeans and panties down along with her jeans. She stepped out of her pants, and I kissed the insides of her thighs, moving around to kiss along her ankles. She moved to lift herself up, then lowered herself on me.</p> <p>"Mmm baby," she began to work her hips up and down, "it feels soooooo good to have all of these fingers in my pussy!"</p> <p>I kissed up to her lips, sucking on her lower lip. I slipped a finger into her and she made little moaning sounds as I did it. She reached down with her free hand and stroked my cock, then slid it out of the opening of my boxers. She took it into her hand, running it up and down her slit, then slid it up into her, slowly.</p> <p>"This might be good for us both," she said.</p> <p>"For sure," I answered, still fingering her.</p> <p>We looked at each other and then started kissing again. She slid her fingers out and pressed against my cock as I slipped my fingers back into her, and we fucked each other. She leaned over and took the tip of it into her mouth, licking it and sucking on it while stroking me back and forth. I was moving my hips up to meet her, thrusting my dick against her fist as she licked, kissed, and stroked me.</p> <p>We both loved the feeling of our skin sliding against each other's. "Fuck!" she said. "I need something in there! Let's change positions." I pushed her back and sat her up on the sofa, standing a few steps back. She quickly lifted her legs and spread them, opening herself for me. I knelt between her legs and took position between them. I positioned myself, pressing my cock against her sopping sex. I took a moment to look at her, then slid into her. We both moaned and kissed as our bodies rubbed against each other. I pulled out and slammed into her.</p> <p>"Oh God, oh God, fuck me, FUCK MEEE!" I was pumping a few strokes in and out of her before I came. She was so wet that her juices flowed down my shaft. When I finished, she pushed me over onto my back. A few moments later, she was on top and riding me, kissing me as she did so, then dropping one of her tits to my mouth.</p> <p>"Let's try something new," she said, sliding off her leg and kneeling on the floor. She reached down between her legs and stroked me. "Now I'm ready," she said, getting back into position. I watched as her hand worked her pussy, a smile on her face. I was in heaven, and so was she. We rocked back and forth, her eyes on me, her hand on me. I looked down at her, and at the sight of myself fucking my girlfriend'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
