I watched fascinated as her body, while not being a match to mine, was revealed. The only problem was that the black thong she was wearing was made of shiny black latex. This meant the thong covered almost all of her pussy. The third one was as black as the first, the one that matched, on the other hand, was a piece of paper with a picture in it. I held my breath. I couldn't believe it, this was actually happening.</p> <p>"What was that?" I asked.</p> <p>"That was one of the videos," she said.</p> <p>"What video" I asked.</p> <p>"It was a very hot video." She smiled.</p> <p>"The video was for Mr. James. I hope you enjoyed it. I've always been a fan of yours." She giggled.</p> <p>I tried to hide the shock that I was actually hearing, but to my shock, despite my best efforts, my cock started to get hard and was straining in my pants.</p> <p>"I'm not sure you do that kind of thing." I said, shaking my head no.</p> <p>"You're only like 3 feet tall and you're only 5'2" yourself," she said smugly. "But at least you have something to prove."</p> <p>"But...what would you be willing to do in return?" I asked.</p> <p>"Whatever you want," she said.</p> <p>"I've been wanting to do this all day," I said.</p> <p>"And I'm only like 6 feet," she added, as if that was my fault.</p> <p>"I have too," I said.</p> <p>"You'll see," she said.</p> <p>"What are the stakes of this?" I asked.</p> <p>"To show off for me," she said, the smile on her face growing.</p> <p>"That could be interesting," I said.</p> <p>"I could do anything I want to you," she said, and I immediately agreed, not expecting to hear any of it, but she did, and as for me, as I expected, I was totally amazed that we could be anything but the best of a wife and mother. We both turned to each other and just stood there in the dark, as if in awe.</p> <p>"We can't do that, it would just look really...tempting," she said, grinning.</p> <p>"Why not?" I said, trying to figure out what to do, but still trying to figure out what she was going to ask.</p> <p>"If we don't stop, we might get caught," she said, shaking her head.</p> <p>"Well," I said. "That depends on how far we get with this."</p> <p>"I guess that would depend very much on how far we keep it from both of us," she said, not looking away from me, her green eyes flashing, before she started to walk toward the door.</p> <p>"Wait," I said.</p> <p>"But how?" she asked, a little annoyed.</p> <p>"Let me get this right," I said, getting up from the couch. "We're married. So, if we were going to have sex, that would be something you can't have. Besides, it's not like you're even in here watching us. You can't even walk around with those clothes on, you're dressed and undressed like a human being. And besides, we know you wouldn't be doing anything that would cause an issue would it? But what were we saying here, it would seem. We've got to stop. No one will walk in on us doing something we are not intending to do."</p> <p>"Of course I'll stop," she said.</p> <p>"But we still won't," I said, shrugging.</p> <p>"Of course we will," she said, and she seemed to relax as I put my hands on her waist and pulled her close to me. It felt strange, and I couldn't explain it. I kissed her deeply and passionately, feeling that she really was a woman now. My hands slid down to her ass and she immediately pulled away, not that I was going to stop them.</p> <p>While we kissing, she began to rub her hands over my chest and down to my cock, as she slowly began to unbutton my shirt. When she was done, she pulled me toward the stairs, which I happily helped her out of.</p> <p>She followed a little later, but that wasn't where we got the rest of the evening. She got into bed and immediately wrapped herself around me, feeling me harden even more. Her pussy pressed lightly to the tip of my cock as she went, and without missing a beat, she began to suck my cock. She didn't just suck me. She started her oral work with enthusiasm.
