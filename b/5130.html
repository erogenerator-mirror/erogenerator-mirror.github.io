So?" he asked, holding up a slender hand.</p> <p>She looked down and nodded. "Just a question."</p> <p>"Ask away."</p> <p>She shook her head and he took her hand, placing it on her arm. He started walking as a small smile crept over his face. This was the first she had ever been with a man and she liked it. The way he moved, the way he held her, the feel of his hands on her bare flesh was intoxicating. He took her down the stairs to his bedroom where he sat down on the bed and looked at her.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to be with a woman?" he asked, as he ran his hand over her arm, over her flat stomach and down to her breast.</p> <p>She turned her head and rested it on his shoulder, sighing against his skin.</p> <p>"I'm sure." His voice was soft, almost seductive, almost as though he wasn't sure what to do.</p> <p>She turned her head away, pulling the blankets up slightly. He kissed the back of her ear and rubbed her breast, feeling her hard nipple through the flimsy cloth. The lightness of his touch on her body was all she needed with him and she bit her lip.</p> <p>"Do you want to..." he started.</p> <p>"I want to," she said, and with that he kissed her neck.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and allowed the light of the candles to light up his body with their tiny incandescence. He took the sheet off of her and put it down on the bed, turning it over so that all that could be seen was his body laying half across her. The sheet fell down her bare legs and she could feel his muscular body pressing against her.</p> <p>"Touch me," she whispered, her body wanting.</p> <p>He ran his hand over the curve of her breast and her nipple, taking it between his thumb and forefinger. Her skin was electric with a tingling that made her body quiver. She felt him shift, and she turned her face towards him, opening her mouth and putting her tongue on her lips. She felt a slight tingle of arousal, the feeling of being taken into his arms, of his hardness pressing on her.</p> <p>He pulled the covers off of the bed leaving them lying on the floor. He climbed over her, her body sliding up towards him, and their lips met. A gentle, tender kiss that left her breathless and her stomach quivered. Their mouths parted but their mouths still connected.</p> <p>Neither of them said a word.</p> <p>He pulled his hands away and placed them on her hips, slowly pulling them down until her legs were up and her thighs around his waist. His left hand slid down her stomach and over her mound, his finger lightly pressing against her.</p> <p>"Are you cold?" he asked, and she nodded shyly.</p> <p>She felt warm hands pulling her panties down and exposing her naked and glistening sex. Slowly he pulled her panties off and tossed them to the side. He pressed himself against her and rubbed himself against her, causing her body to convulse against his hard penis.</p> <p>His lips left hers and kissed down her neck and her earlobe. He pressed his forehead against hers and he could smell the scent of her arousal on her skin. He took her right nipple into his mouth, licking the soft flesh as it hardened between his lips. His hand on her left breast stroked it, pulling at the flesh as his lips continued down her body.</p> <p>Her mouth opened to receive his tongue and he licked it along the length of her. His hands were on her stomach, working their way upwards to her breasts, sliding in around her ribs. He squeezed her breasts together and tugged at her nipples, causing her to moan in response.</p> <p>He kissed her stomach, moving upwards as his hands slid over her thighs, slowly creeping closer to the base of her belly. He brushed his fingers over the top half, teasing her until she closed her eyes and moaned.</p> <p>He looked down at her, noticing that she had parted her legs. He pushed her thighs back towards her stomach and kissed over the insides of her thighs. He could smell that intoxicating sex and his stomach clenched with the desire to taste it. He looked up at her face and grinned at her, loving the sight of her with nothing, a woman willing to submit to his lust so easily.</p> <p>His hands reached around her body and she let him slide his hands under her. Her hands were pulling him closer, grinding against him as his thick cock began to pulse against her hip. He bent down and kissed along her leg. She opened her eyes and he brought a hand to kiss her cheek.</p> <p>"You need to tell meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
