I think the three of us could have some fun!"</p> <p>Everyone had laughed at the suggestion of going to dinner with them, and everyone knew the three of them would be joining them shortly to pick up the other couple. They had no idea why they had asked them if they wanted to go, but they were eager to see how it went.</p> <p>"You girls want to join us in our little fun?" one of the guys asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" Amy blurted out, "But I'd like some first."</p> <p>They grabbed my bags and I followed the other couple into the lobby where Amy quickly brought the food in. Amy quickly made room for us and all the people started to come and eat, which made me and the guys even more nervous. A very familiar group of people walked over to us and we all went off to take our seats.</p> <p>"Well now, it's just about time!!" Amy spoke up as we sat down. "So, tell us more about yourself! You really do have quite the portfolio!"</p> <p>"Well, actually, my friend here likes me!" I said, grinning at Amy.</p> <p>"So," someone behind Amy said. I looked briefly and saw that the woman who introduced herself as Sarah, was a sophomore at the University I'd been told she lived in. She'd invited me to go with her as she knew that I would still be in town, and Sarah and her would definitely have fun together! "Well, Sarah, what do you like to drink?" I asked.</p> <p>"Jack," she replied. I gave her a bottle of Malbec and she opened up the glass for me, then filled Sarah in about the life she'd been living up to before getting thrown out.</p> <p>The group of people continued to cheer the conversation as they ate a few bites of food and chatted about different people on the campus and various parts of their lives. When they had finished, Sarah asked, "So, Amy, are you in the process of getting your degree?!"</p> <p>"Oh, yes and no!" Amy replied, looking around, then turned and kissed me passionately. "I love my life, but my friends, and I just love to surprise them sometimes!"</p> <p>"So, Amy," Sarah said, "is there anything you wouldn't tell us that would make your life so interesting to you?"</p> <p>Amy looked at me, "I'd do anything in order to have an opportunity like today!"</p> <p>"Well, let me get this straight..." Sarah said, picking up Sarah's cell phone. "My roommate, is on her way back here to pick up her guy. Do you guys want to meet them there?"</p> <p>Sarah took the phone and placed it on the table. Then she looked to Amy, "Well, I guess that we could meet you there in an hour... and I'll make that appointment to pick up another couple! See you then!"</p> <p>Sarah and I watched Sarah walk off and then back through the lobby and down the stairs that lead out to the back entrance. I watched in surprise as this beautiful young couple that I'd been wondering about for some time, with whom I'd been attracted in a public setting, actually had planned to meet a couple. It was just an opportunity to meet and let some people know that I'm dating a female major league athlete. They were clearly looking forward to it and my mind was on the possibility of a few drinks and some fun with them at the party at their place the following week.</p> <p>Sarah had already started picking up our food as we headed out the door. As Sarah got to the end of the row of tables, the two guys sitting nearby were still standing.</p> <p>"That's my girl!" one of the guys said, giving Sarah a quick hug, "You look fantastic!"</p> <p>She looked at him and said, "Oh, thank you..." then turned to me and whispered, "You look pretty incredible too, too" with a smile on her face.</p> <p>I smiled and said, "Thank you for making me feel so happy, and for the fun you have had. I really enjoyed meeting you both!"</p> <p>Sarah blushed a little but the two guys smiled and held their hands out to shake theirs. So, here we were, all of us, with just a few minutes onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
