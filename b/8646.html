But, I really wish I wasn't such a prude." She smiled nervously and looked away.</p> <p>"I guess your not, but there is much less time for modesty than if you were a prude. Do you need to get off of your hands and knees so they can see? My room is over there," I pointed to the door.</p> <p>"No thank you," she said timidly as she got up and slipped her feet to the carpet leaving her barefoot. "Do you like being with her?" I asked.</p> <p>"God yes," she said. After thinking for almost a minute, she added, "I'd love to just be her. I just hope that's what the other is thinking, when she looks at you."</p> <p>I laughed to myself. I knew what her other reaction would be.</p> <p>I was sitting on a chair in the living room and she sat down on the edge of the sofa. I looked down at her and I smiled to myself. She appeared to be an interesting young woman. She wore her long tousled brown hair loose and hanging down around her face. It was short and quite wiry. It was almost comically beautiful.</p> <p>"Is it your dress?" I said to her, as I stood up.</p> <p>"Well, it certainly comes down a fair bit, but it fits," she said.</p> <p>"What do you wear under it?"</p> <p>"This," she giggled.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind," I said. "I mean the dress. I think that would be okay."</p> <p>She laughed, which I'm sure she heard in my tone.</p> <p>"It feels nice," she said to me as she looked at me. "It looks really nice on you. But, I mean what if someone sees me wearing it?"</p> <p>"I don't know, but it looks kind of strange that way," I said.</p> <p>She sat back down and I sat down next to her.</p> <p>"Thank you for understanding," I said.</p> <p>"It's alright," she said. "You look really nice."</p> <p>"Thank you," I replied.</p> <p>We sat like that for a few minutes, as she asked me what I meant by the other person's name. I told her that it was my cousin, Lisa, and that I'd liked her a lot. "Lisa, is that you?"</p> <p>"That's me," she laughed. "I've known her since she was six years old. That's her first name. She's one of those girls. She always wanted to be called Tommie,"</p> <p>"That's kind of cute," I said smiling at her.</p> <p>"Do you want to hang out with me some time?" she said.</p> <p>"Sure, I would love to."</p> <p>"Good," she smiled. "Then, you should come over whenever. You're going to get plenty of privacy. "</p> <p>"Okay, well, thanks again. I'm staying with Mom," I said and looked at her.</p> <p>"Are you going to be too lonely now that she's gone?" she laughed.</p> <p>I nodded. "I guess, but I'm sure she'll come back."</p> <p>After we had coffee and talked about our day, I said, "I guess we should take a break for awhile."</p> <p>"Really?" she said with a surprised look. She had seen me do it as soon as we were alone.</p> <p>I smiled to myself and replied, "I guess it's no trouble at all," and gave her a hug.</p> <p>"But," she asked looking up at me.</p> <p>"But of course," I answered. "It's nice to meet someone who means so much to her."</p> <p>She smiled. "I'm glad you liked me as much as I liked you."</p> <p>"I don't know what anybody else liked," I said. "That's kind of the same thing I like doing."</p> <p>"What? Why is it nice for you to meet anyone who likes you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," I said and smiled. "I guess what you don't know is that I love you."</p> <p>"Well," she smiled, "if you don't mind."</p> <p>"No, not at all," I smiled. "And I'm glad to see you again."</p> <p>"I really am," she said. "I really am."</p> <p>"So why are you sitting down?" I asked as I stood up.</p> <p>"I'm thinking of having you stay with me," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
