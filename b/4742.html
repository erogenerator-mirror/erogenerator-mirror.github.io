I could feel her tongue probing my mouth. Our tongues locked as the first waves of passion engulfed me. The passion of the moment lasted longer than either of us had anticipated or expected. We were both consumed by the passion and the lust of our lovemaking, although we were both in a different world. When her lips parted, the aroma of her perfume filled my nose. I pushed her away, leaned over her and we resumed our kissing. She parted her lips and my tongue slid into her mouth. I tasted her mouth and I felt her tongue dance with mine.</p> <p>My arms slipped around her and I cupped one of her breasts in one of my hands. She squirmed against me, as I squeezed her breast through her negligee. As her nipples hardened, the swollen nubs made a little nippling sound.</p> <p>Our bodies were joined, and we both had great difficulty in maintaining control. The excitement of the moment was overpowering.</p> <p>I released her nipple and I dropped to my knees to take one of her legs in my arms. I lifted it over my shoulder and began to work it's weight from side to side. As I gently caressed her pussy lips, I could feel her breathing deepen. I began with a light brushing over her clit and lips. As I stroked her pussy lips, she began to move, sliding her hips in rhythm to my caresses. I stopped briefly to kiss and lick the tip of her erect clit, then I repeated my movements with the sensitive button. When I gently blew on it, she stiffened and her body spasmed against me.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes, I'm there," she moaned, as she began her orgasm. The waves of her spasms shook, shook and shook her. It was a wonderful sensation I had not experienced in several years, and I have to say, I had never experienced it like this before. This time, her orgasm seemed longer. She shook with her orgasm, and her breath was coming in short, sharp gasps.</p> <p>"Wow, I think I've never been this way, I've never been so excited. Are you okay?" she asked, breathlessly. A drop of her wine fell on the pillow, and then the smell of her perfume was there.</p> <p>"I'm fine," I said sheepishly. "I never realized how much stronger the orgasm is." I slid back on my knees and looked down at her naked body. As I looked up she smiled at me and her eyes sparkled. Her naked breasts were slightly upturned, her nipples hard. I caressed one of her breasts gently with one hand as I kissed her. I reached my lips to her nipple and took it between my lips. She moaned, and I pulled on it with my lips. My hand moved to the other breast and I took it between my fingers. She gasped. And her eyes opened as her nipples responded to me even more.</p> <p>I moved up her body and then sat on the edge of the bed to remove my robe. I was nude, and my erection stood proudly as it pointed toward the ceiling. She turned on her side and faced me while she reached for him. I stood up and moved into her arms. She held me as her tongue touched my lips. I was aware that I had dropped about half of her negligee, and knew she was exposed for me to look at.</p> <p>She pulled away to move to the bed. She slowly climbed off me, then sat where she was, her legs spread. She was so beautiful. Her pussy was beautiful, so pink, wet, red, and swollen. The lips of her labia were spread, her clit, her vagina, the slit below, and her breasts, which were large and full, but were beautiful, also, full and hard to feel and touch, as if I had no idea their size. Her nipples and clitoris were pointed as she moved forward and lay on her back. And as I looked, my cock stood straight up again, throbbing, and hard.</p> <p>My own cock was a mere inch above her. I felt I could touch her. I took my cock gently by the base. I touched her outer lips a few times as the drop of liquid touched her clit. She smiled.</p> <p>"I want you," she said. "May I?" she asked. She reached a hand out and moved the head of my cock over one of her nipples, then took the head in her mouth, licked it, and sucked it. As I began to slide slowly over her nipple I moved the head on her other. I was amazed at how soft and warm her flesh was. It responded to my touch.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me, Jack," she pleaded.</p> <p>And so I began. I lifted her hips high and slid my cock down across herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
