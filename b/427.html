She felt him move behind her and her hands slipped naturally around his waist to caress his skin. When she thought she could trust his hands anywhere she squeezed his arms tightly to keep him there. "No need to be formal," she whispered. "I feel very comfortable with you and I'm just as comfortable with what you're doing to me." She didn't think she'd ever been so relaxed and comfortable in her life. She didn't know where some things went from here. This was her own private moment and she wanted to share it with the man she'd just met.</p> <p>"I thought we'd be done there long ago. If you'd like you can get on your knees," he said. She did so, but he took his right knee between hers. He was on his knees beside her as he pulled her knees apart and she felt his hardness pressing against her thigh.</p> <p>"What, what should I do next?" she asked, but when his hands came to rest at the tops of her thighs she could already tell there was no way he'd be able to stop from going up her inside thigh. She wondered how he was doing with such an intimate dance, and decided she needed to be taken very, very carefully.</p> <p>"You can have me, but I can't have you just lying there." Her knees parted and he took hold of the top of her dress. She felt the cool air on her bare thighs and let out a little gasp when his fingers gently pulled the fabric from between her legs. He was taking everything in, and not only looking at her. "Please, don't," she murmured. But he didn't move. She could tell by the way he leaned down he was pleased with his progress. She felt him gently unzip the little zipper and she lifted onto her elbows to help him as she took her knees and pulled the fabric from around her waist. It was clear he hadn't been planning to remove everything but some of her stockings, which she could always pull up as he wanted.</p> <p>He leaned in closer while he took himself out of its confinement. "Do you want me inside you?" he whispered. "Just tell me okay?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes, god, yes," she whispered in a voice loud enough to go up an octave higher than normal. His hands slid up to hold her hips as he took one of her stocking clad legs and raised it up to his mouth. She saw just how excited she was by the feel of his warm breath against her thigh. His lips and teeth grazed the fabric against her skin to tease and draw it between them. When she raised her left leg he let it glide between them. "Oh god yes, yes. Now take it," she moaned as he sucked and licked her to her second orgasm.</p> <p>She wasn't as loud as she'd been as she sat there and let him make love to her. This was going to make it harder for her to concentrate on her own emotions. She wasn't sure her head was going to fit into her rear view mirror but she was sure she could see his hands, her legs, her breasts. She'd never been so turned on in her life and it had her breathing hard. Her pussy was so wet and needy. She wasn't sure she could even call it her vagina or even if she liked that word. She couldn't even remember her being so turned on that day. There was just something about the way he was touching her. His kisses where oh so soft and sexy to her. Her fingers touched herself while he brought her to orgasm.</p> <p>He moved his face over to hers and she felt the warmth of him, the warmth of his breath on her neck. "I don't think we'll be going out again like this, not when we're together," he whispered, his voice hoarse at his words. His hands slid down her sides and she couldn't help but wonder if he'd left any clothes on.</p> <p>"No, come here and have me," she murmured and he quickly shifted onto his back. She sat on him and saw the look of satisfaction on his face. Her arms folded over his body and her lips found his. He was hard again as she slid down him to ride his hardness. She felt his hands at some level guiding her hips as they moved. Her body was so aroused and wet that by the time she reached her release she could feel him on the verge. She couldn't tell how or why. He was so good to her. She kissed him in anticipation as he drove harder, wanting his release to be as much as possible. When she felt it coming she held him hard as it rocked her world. "God, yes, don't stop," she cried. "I'll cum."</p> <p>She fellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
