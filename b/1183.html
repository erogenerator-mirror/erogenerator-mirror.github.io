After some time we had her sitting down opposite me.</p> <p>I said:</p> <p>"It is the greatest joy for a man to dance with a lovely woman."</p> <p>I took her in my arms and we began kissing passionately. And when we finished, I said:</p> <p>"Your very attractive. You will have my heart, my soul, my love."</p> <p>She responded:</p> <p>"You make me a fine lover. I could not be happier. But there is one thing you must know."</p> <p>I replied:</p> <p>"What is that?"</p> <p>"The main component of anything lovers share. Love will grow within us."</p> <p>"What does love have to do with anything?"</p> <p>She kissed me again and said:</p> <p>"We have both been taught that love cannot work without love to have success."</p> <p>"You are a very smart woman. It is more natural for the soul to trust."</p> <p>I replied:</p> <p>"There is also love that can work with other love."</p> <p>She held my penis in her hands and replied:</p> <p>"No, there is not such a thing."</p> <p>"Yes, there are, love, and sex."</p> <p>She said:</p> <p>"Yes you are right."</p> <p>"It is the one thing that is impossible to do without love."</p> <p>I answered her and said:</p> <p>"I will teach you love. That must not be difficult."</p> <p>"The first thing you must learn should be patience."</p> <p>"As you said about yourself."</p> <p>"I am also a very smart man."</p> <p>"I will teach you."</p> <p>I took her in my arms and we kissed, a deep passionate kiss.</p> <p>After some more time, I took care of her so her breasts fell on my chest as I reached my arms around her to hold her.</p> <p>And I was aware of her passion:</p> <p>"You are such a beautiful woman." I said.</p> <p>-</p> <p>I was not expecting such a proposal. Thereafter I asked her:</p> <p>"Would it be okay if I make love to you?"</p> <p>She replied:</p> <p>"Of course, you have nothing to do with me."</p> <p>"I was feeling as if it was all coming together today."</p> <p>"Yes. I was thinking it will be our life's work to make you happy."</p> <p>"I am happy with it." She replied, as she lifted her head on my shoulder and kissed me.</p> <p>I said:</p> <p>"Do you like it, sweet?"</p> <p>"I love it. I always want more of it." She replied.</p> <p>And I gently removed her panties in one motion.</p> <p>She said:</p> <p>"Please put it in me. You will not hurt me."</p> <p>"Would you really feel like that? I will not hurt."</p> <p>"Please put it in me."</p> <p>I said: "Is this a man thing?"</p> <p>"No silly, I am a woman. I have a lovely woman. You must love and love her."</p> <p>I took my penis in my hand and gently inserted half of it. And I kept my head in her neck as our kissing continued.</p> <p>It was lovely. I was also very excited. It was as if I was being taken to the height of passion in a very short time.</p> <p>She said:</p> <p>"When you are ready, you have to come to me."</p> <p>I felt very aroused by talking about sex. It was very exciting.</p> <p>I whispered to her:</p> <p>"Just a minute."</p> <p>I took out the bottle of lube and told her to lube it.</p> <p>She returned with a lube of some sort, lubricated it on her fingers, and began massaging it on my penis.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and enjoyed her hand on my penis, as if it was a lover and I could have this most erotic time ever.</p> <p>When I had sufficiently discharged my load, she brought it up to my mouth. I accepted it gratefully.</p> <p>As if she was pleased with the act, a part of my erection disappeared.</p> <p>She said: "Your penis is still very excited."</p> <p>"But I think I will come in a few seconds."</p> <p>"Would you like to give me a massage."</p> <p>I could not refuse.</p> <p>I laid her down on her back and lay on top of her, rubbing my hand all over her body and legs. Her fingers touched my penis and started working on it. I moved on her body to rub her left arm and her shoulder. I had to go some and also hold her left hand, which held my penis, to keep it awayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
