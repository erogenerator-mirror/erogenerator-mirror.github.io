The weather was really warm and we were just beginning to warm up when Ann started to rub the lotion on me. We started the day off with some small talk about the day and how things happened at work. Once more I noticed that I had been getting a little sunburned and had to go the other way around so that's what I did. Ann went and got the lotion, we had been walking along the beach for a few minutes when her hand went down between my legs and started to rub the sun block on my back. For a moment I think she was rubbing lotion all over my back but she didn't stop. It didn't seem to really matter because I'm not sure I had much to say. I mean after what I had seen earlier I started to think I might like it and she didn't seem too put out by that.</p> <p>The more she played around the more I felt like my body was going to react or react more to her than it was to me. As she rubbed the lotion on my back it was starting to make things hard on me. I mean while I know I am a young guy I don't think I can get over myself when I am in the sun...it's kind of like looking at a cat. But I don't think I would have ever seen the cat before now.</p> <p>Ann came back to our camp and we went upstairs to change and relax. When we came down we saw everyone else out on the beach having lunch. When Ann joined me I noticed she had removed her bikini top so all were looking at her tits. Ann also noticed the looks and kept smiling at me. I guess it didn't bother her at all that I kept staring. I felt bad for taking the chance that my wife would do something that I didn't like to happen.</p> <p>"Hey Bill," Ann said as we stood up to go see if we could meet anyone that might have seen her do that, "Do you like what you see?"</p> <p>I looked at my beautiful wife and asked "So do you mean it?"</p> <p>"Well, I suppose it depends on what you mean." Ann started to unbutton the blouse she was wearing. I stopped her as her shirt dropped exposing her breasts to everyone.</p> <p>"Well," I asked her.</p> <p>Ann looked in the direction of the others and saw that I was looking at her breasts and smiled. "Bill," she said as she slipped the shirt off and let it fall to the beach floor, "Would you like to join me in a little swim? " Ann said handing me the beach towel that was just laying on the sand. Ann then turned to me and said, "Are you going to join me?"</p> <p>"Sure," I said with a big smile which turned into a big yawn, "I'll do the honors."</p> <p>Ann looked up and down the beach and said, "That's a shame! Maybe we should be going back to the house."</p> <p>"Well, you go for it," I said as I got down off my chair and walked out of the camp. I went home, but I wasn't really comfortable with Ann being nude around other people and she wasn't as much in the mood as I thought she was. I still didn't want to do anything to upset her so I just went out.</p> <p>Ann was sitting in her room as I got there. Looking at her I could feel that something was going on between us...something that would never end.</p> <p>"Would you like to go out on a nude beach with me Ann?," I said with a grin on my face.</p> <p>"Actually, I need to get some sun tan."</p> <p>I took a little while to go to the backyard where it was sunny but still warm. I was pretty close to the backdoor so I started to walk down to the water. Ann gave me a wave and then turned and started swimming toward the beach. When we were close to the water I told her, "Ann, stop in front of the water. Don't go in the water, just swim back to your room."</p> <p>Ann looked at me for a minute and then started running back to the door. After a couple minutes I had to hold her up as she ran towards the door. We got in the pool and Ann grabbed the bottom of my suit and quickly took it off. She then went to the side of the pool away from the other people. When I saw her back up at the bottom of the pool I saw her ass sway as she walked away. Her bottoms fell to the ground and when she sat down I noticed my wife had her skirt almost up to her waist and my wife was bare bottomed out swimming. I looked around to see that a number of people were in the water and a couple had their bottoms in the waterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
