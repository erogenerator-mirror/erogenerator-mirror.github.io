Then he was off in the hallway to help her get dressed. When he closed the door to her room her heart thudded away and she felt as though she wanted it to be different. It didn't even look like she was going to be dressing. She stepped into her room and saw her reflection in the mirror. Her hair and neck were a mess with sweat and dried tears. Her face hadn't been that tender, but then she didn't let on that she'd been crying.</p> <p>"Hey, it's good to see you," Alex said, coming with a washcloth to dab at the tears. She wiped her eyes and looked up at him. "What's this 'fucking asshole' idea you had about getting dressed and showing me how much a slut you really are?"</p> <p>"Well," she said with a small laugh, "I didn't say anything about what kind of slut I was. I wasn't really trying to hide anything. I was just being a little flaky."</p> <p>"I don't know what you were trying to tell me," Alex said, a nervous edge to his voice. "Just a little flaky? You can have any woman you want."</p> <p>"I'm not going into any more details. We just finished dinner. That's all I know so I'll let you get back to it later." She was about to leave when she stopped herself. She was scared, she knew. He was going to say he got a good look at her body, at least his own, but if it embarrassed him then he didn't have to go to the trouble. He would just have her in for a quick fuck and probably a good time too. "I just don't think I am ready to be a woman."</p> <p>"You're not ready? I thought you were ready for the world to stop calling you a slut."</p> <p>"Oh. No. I really am ready. It's just that...it's been so long and I just...I don't think I'm ready yet."</p> <p>"It's too early for that," he said quickly. "I'll go back in and fix you something else. Let's get going." He pulled her through the hall and out the door and into her car. He opened the door for her and she climbed in, the look on her face still funny. "You know if you want me to get dressed then you have to do it yourself. After all this is your first night here." He gave her a light kiss and she turned around to see if her hair was all messed and dry. It looked like it had come off the woman who had her clothes off all night. She quickly grabbed the dress and started to slip it on.</p> <p>"I'm going back to bed," she said. "Stay up and get cleaned up."</p> <p>"Goodnight and goodnight," he replied as he headed back upstairs.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Julie looked more and more like a young school teacher, with a boy's face and a lot of braces on. She could feel her skin prickle in the small area above her lips, but it took three more orgasms to convince her it was just a dream. She was just glad it was going to end soon.</p> <p>As Julie lay in her bed that night, she couldn't help thinking that she hadn't had sex in a long time. It hadn't been as bad as she had hoped. She had come to realize a woman was just a little bit less sensitive than a man and she had learned to hold her tongue. It wasn't the best course of sexual intercourse, but it wasn't bad either.</p> <p>Julie had been with about one person in her past, one guy who made her have orgasms and one guy that she thought very, very much liked it. If the guy knew what she liked, he probably didn't get much action. There was nothing like having his mouth on your pussy or something else. If you loved it, then you wanted it.</p> <p>She had found herself going between men, letting them take her on all kinds of things. It was the first time she had cheated on her husband. He had been a very good man, but she hadn't really wanted to cheat on him. He hadn't turned her on like she wanted, she had thought, but maybe that was just how women felt. She remembered the first time she had cheated on her husband with another man, how it felt good to have a cock in your pussy. She had never done anything with another woman but she had been faithful to her husband for the last ten years. She had never had an affair with a guy other than her husband.</p> <p>Suddenly, she got nervous. She couldn't believe she had done it with another man.
