"But if he's got a little on me, it'll be just an experience for him, not anything much. But, after a while you'll understand."</p> <p>As I spoke I felt a twinge between my legs where my cock had grown erect.</p> <p>"Maybe he can make it hurt a little," she said. She reached into her bedside table and took a vibrator with a dildo.</p> <p>"Oh, and one thing," she said, "there's something I need to do with this." She took the toy out of her drawer and turned on the toy to full power again. "I think he's going to be in me now," she said, reaching under her nightshirt and pulling her breasts free. "He is."</p> <p>We both went to get on the bed and she lay down with her back towards me and guided me between her legs by my cock.</p> <p>"This is nice," she sighed, "just like my vagina, just nicer." She slid her body back onto my hips and pulled me slowly forward so that my cock pressed against her labia.</p> <p>As soon as I was inside her she held me. We just held each other, our legs locked together, our arms wrapped tightly around each other. My mind started racing in my head. This was so wrong, but the excitement of the moment and the knowledge of my wife's lover...she was willing and able to do this to her.</p> <p>She turned toward me and slid her lips on to my shoulder. My cock slid against her entrance. She paused.</p> <p>"Ready?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied and moved the tip up to meet her.</p> <p>She was already wet, so she slid easily against me, letting me slide in. I closed my eyes, enjoying the feeling of her warm, slippery insides.</p> <p>Her voice reached my ears as she spoke.</p> <p>"Just like that," she said. "I want to be like him."</p> <p>We kissed, again for the first time in a long time, not caring who saw or heard us. It felt so right.</p> <p>I moved up on my knees against her.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhhh yeeeeeeeesssssssssss!"</p> <p>"What is it?" she asked, and I didn't answer.</p> <p>"He's really going in and out real nice and slow," she said, "really sliding right, really deep."</p> <p>My mind went into overdrive thinking about that.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," I moaned softly. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>"I love you so very much."</p> <p>With that, she lifted her body off of me.</p> <p>"I think this will hurt a bit."</p> <p>She took my head in her hands and pushed down. I gasped.</p> <p>"Oh, it's okay. Please. Let it all in."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, a little shocked at myself, but very excited.</p> <p>I felt her slide my shaft out a little bit, then slide her bottom back inside.</p> <p>"Oh, that's amazing. Can you feel how far he has gone in?"</p> <p>I felt her body quiver slightly as her muscles squeezed my head.</p> <p>I smiled as I whispered, "You're just going to have to do that more often than you know."</p> <p>It didn't last long, and her body began quivering slightly. I knew she wouldn't last much longer. I pushed, feeling her pull her bottom right out so I could still see my cock.</p> <p>"Oh, that's good," she moaned quietly. "Oh, it feels so good."</p> <p>She paused again, allowing me to slide up into her without an interruption. She squeezed my butt with her right hand as she worked it in and out. Now it slid with a soft, slow steady rhythm. Her eyes watched me intently.</p> <p>"That feels so nice," she breathed.</p> <p>She continued to let me slowly move in and out of her.</p> <p>"Oh, you love it don't you," she said. She took a nipple between her fingers and pulled it up and down, twisting slightly.</p> <p>I felt her move her hips against me and she moaned again. It felt so good.</p> <p>"I love you," she said.</p> <p>It was the momentary feeling of being in an unknown place where no feeling of love will ever return.</p> <p>"I never wanted you for anything," she said.</p> <p>"We'll have to find the right guy," I said quietly</p> <p>I continued to move in and out of her, not makingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
