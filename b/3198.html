I could tell she was very impressed with my mouth while her tongue started to explore my mouth. I slid my finger across her clit and she was still holding my cock with one hand. I moved my kisses across her neck to a nipple as my index finger slid over it to touch the opening of her love hole. She was wet as I started to slide my index finger into her ass hole. Her breathing started to quicken and she started to lift her body upward. My hand found her clit again and I started to finger fuck her with two fingers. I could feel how tight she was as her pussy slowly opened up to accept my fingers. I could feel her breathing increase as she started to moan. I slowly started to speed up, building a rhythm and I could tell she was close.</p> <p>"God, I am getting close," she gasped.</p> <p>I slowly withdrew my fingers and turned her around to face me as I positioned myself above her, putting one arm around her shoulders, the other holding her breast up and the tip of my cock near her lips. It didn't take long for both of us to moan in unison as I sank my cock into her with one stroke. She took it in with one hand and started to lick and suck it again. We started to fuck each other as we kept going at each other. I felt her hand move down between our bodies and started to rub my balls with one hand while she played with my nipples with the other. Our hips started to buck with the intensity of the experience. I reached back and pushed her hair so that it came to the top of her chest. I could see a look of pure bliss on her face before her eyes rolled back into her head. I started to fuck her harder as our mouths locked together in a passionate embrace. It was getting harder as well. She started to kiss my chin and neck from which I followed. She opened my mouth with hers and we kissed her way toward my lips.</p> <p>Our tongues intertwined with each other and it took every ounce of control for us to hold off. I could feel her leg moving up and down my butt as we were locked in such a tight embrace. Neither one of us spoke when she finally broke the kiss and I saw her eyes cloud with passion. I slowly started to thrust her back into me and her legs started to go up and down my thighs as I felt my own orgasm begin. We let our arms fall away as we lay together on the bed. We kissed in the end of the day. We both smiled in anticipation.</p> <p>I turned her out of bed and grabbed her hand. I led her over to the shower bench. She looked so hot as I watched her bend forward to step into the cold water. We shared a smile as we looked back at the other as we lathered each other up. I washed hers thoroughly and she ran her hands over mine as we kissed. I rubbed my soapy hands around her body and it was such an erotic experience. I moved up so I could feel her breasts. I started to play with her nipples as my hands were all over her. We washed each other and enjoyed the feeling of our bodies as we caressed each other. We finished off, dried off and stepped into the bedroom to sit in the bed for a little time. I gently rubbed her legs and then her body. She lay back and I started to move slowly up the inside of her thigh. I slipped my thumbs from under her bottom to the outside of her outer lips, which were spread wide open. I kissed the very tip of her clit and she said "God that felt good" and started to rub it. I just waited until she was moaning with desire and slid my tongue over her nub. She grabbed my hair as I started to lick her. I felt her legs tense around my head, pushing me deeper and then relax as I felt her cum. I knew she was ready to cum in time as I felt my own orgasm start. My cum seemed to pump in and out of her until she grabbed my hair and pushed my face onto her pussy, forcing my tongue as far in as it would go. She moaned her release in my ear as she began to buck and writhe on the bed. When she settled down I moved up and kissed her as she ran her hands on my hair and body as I licked her pussy clean.</p> <p>After the shower we got into bed and we kissed and started to play with each other. We lay side by side and enjoyed it for a bit as we could each feel a hand on our bodies.</p> <p>"This looks like fun," she said as I turned myself on, got out of the bed and then moved up beside her and lay down after we both climbed on. We got into the sixty-nine position and started to lick each others cunt. We were both so happy that ourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
