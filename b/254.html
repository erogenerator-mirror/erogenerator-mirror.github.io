We walked down the path past the main street, it was almost empty except for the street light that was turned on, as was ours. We were at the end of a long grass-covered path in the middle of the woods, the shadows behind us hid the path from view.</p> <p>I noticed that it was now very dark and the trail was almost straight ahead. It was only a couple of hundred yards and I knew I couldn’t see the car until it stopped. My wife was the center of my attention. There would be an end to that thought, but it was something that I couldn’t get out of my mind. Suddenly I thought of that night we had in high school, the girl in the school uniform sitting in the front corner of the classroom as the janitor sat across her. I couldn’t stop myself but something else crept into my mind’s eye as I watched her move, that night, as she sat in the front corner, listening to the guys go at each other, listening to the principal and teacher. As I watched she started to unbutton her blouse then slid it off her shoulders. The sight of her beautiful breasts almost exploded with color and energy, she stood up and faced me but didn’t come all the way to me. She had her arms on her stomach and started looking around, then looked at me in the face. Her eyes pleaded with me for me to give her something to remember time later, which I was not willing to do, I just kneed out and got in front of her. She quickly removed her skirt and I could see that she was now in just her panties and when her hands were out she stood there in front of me in nothing but her bra and her bra was white. The way her bra looked on her she looked damn good in it.</p> <p>I was sitting in a chair in our dark room, in the dark. I took hold of each of her arms and pushed them against the back of the chair. I wanted to be close enough to feel her skin, to smell her, to touch her. It’s just too much to be wearing. She was now facing my chest and her head had dropped down and was looking around. She had her hands on her stomach and her hair hanging down to the front of her shoulders with a slight buzz of hair above her shoulders. I reached up and pulled her bra down over a breast, she lifted her head to reach for it but I pushed her hand behind her neck and let it go. I was looking right into her eyes as I gently pushed her against the chair and said, “What’s this?” Then I leaned in and licked just one of her nipples with the tip of my tongue.</p> <p>She froze, her legs began to give way, she was going to start to cry. I ran my nails down the middle of her back then let my thumbs trace the curves of her back sides. Her legs and arms shook and I felt her start to breathe quickly. I kept the other breast and her breast, I held it against me as I kissed her. She started to struggle and cry, but I held firm.</p> <p>As I kissed her she was sobbing and crying and now I had no control over her body. I lifted my face and kissed the top half of her head and neck then reached around her and undid her bra. I lifted up her arms and pulled it off so I could run my hands down her back and feel those gorgeous globes of hers. Her breasts were so firm that as I squeezed them she moaned and my hand found it’s way to her pussy. Her juices were flowing and I could easily feel what was inside of her. I kept squeezing and massaging her with my hands as my mouth worked on her neck and the other side of her neck. I ran my tongue over her collar bone and kissed my way up to her lips where I gently sucked and kissed her earlobes and earlobes. I felt her start to tremble and I felt a flood of wetness around my cock. I pressed in with her hips and kept working on her. I felt her hands go to my face and hold onto it, as I kissed her. Her breath was coming in short breaths and I sucked her tongue into my mouth. Her head tilted to the side and she sucked her own lips into her mouth and rolled them. Her hand went up to my cheek, it brushed my lips, I ran my tongue across them.</p> <p>I pulled of her mouth and her jaw relaxed, she leaned on me and we kissed again. I wanted us to be more passionate, to make love, but I didn’t know how I felt about that. We were kissing and it only seemed to make our love more intense even as a couple. I could feel my—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
