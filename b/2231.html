"Don't worry," he said softly, his lips brushing her soft hair. "You'll see." She relaxed into his arms. She moved to kneel up on the couch and wrapped herself around his arms as he lay down on the couch. He pulled her closer to him as he kissed her forehead, kissing down her cheek, trailing his tongue lightly into her eyes, and up her neck to her mouth. She turned her head to kiss his lips and he pressed them to hers.</p> <p>"Good night," he whispered to her.</p> <p>"Good nights, Jason," the voice said from the darkness. She turned her head slightly and was greeted by the sight of what she had come to come with, the bed. He kissed her temple with a smile.</p> <p>"Good night, lover," she whispered.</p> <p>Jason closed her eyes and was already lost in himself when the sound of running feet reached his ears. He was about to ask her to get up when he ran his hand over her. She sighed and turned to him. He watched as her hand rested on his chest and he held her tight. She kissed him quickly and he responded. He held her close.</p> <p>"Let's fuck," she said.</p> <p>"Okay," he smiled. He pulled her onto her back and kissed her forehead.</p> <p>"And for you, sweet darling," she said, her lips brushing his as his fingers reached under her shirt and found a nipple. She was naked beneath it and she was wet for him. His hands ran over her soft globes and she wrapped around him.</p> <p>He pushed her down so she was lying on the bed and pushed her onto her back. He leaned over her allowing her to look up at him. His lips brushed her as his hands slowly moved up and down her belly. He slowly dragged his hand across her stomach.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she moaned in anticipation.</p> <p>Her pussy felt hot and moist as he slid a finger slowly into her as his other leg came up and over her hip. He felt her move on his hand. It was time to move on top of her. He kissed his way up her face as his hands moved to her breasts as his hips shifted. He kissed her lips then ran his tongue slowly across and down her neck.</p> <p>"Oh." She purred. He ran his tongue slowly down her lips. She opened her mouth and he felt her tongue meet him. He could taste her. She tasted delicious.</p> <p>His mouth moved down her neck to her breasts where his hands took them in his hands and lifted them up. She was right there. He teased her breasts with his mouth. He looked up.</p> <p>"I want to taste you." He said looking down over her body.</p> <p>"Do what?" she asked.</p> <p>"Play with yourself. I want to watch you."</p> <p>"Play with me what?"</p> <p>"Play with it." He smiled as he moved to between her thighs.</p> <p>"But Jason, I want more than that. Please." She begged.</p> <p>"You're sweet. But there's something else I need to do. Would you really do that for me?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Okay, then lay back and enjoy," he said as he pushed her legs apart. "I want to see you come for me."</p> <p>He bent forward and looked into her eyes. She nodded. He leaned down and brought his mouth down to kiss her. She tasted so good. Her body felt as if it had been freshly mown.</p> <p>He moved on top of her, kissing her lips, her throat with his tongue, and her breasts with his hands. He lowered himself down, kissing her stomach, stomach, and thighs. He could feel how hot her cunt was. He gently slid down her belly with his tongue, teasing her skin until he hit her pussy. His tongue licked her pussy lips as he licked her lips, teasing her clit. He heard her moan as his tongue traced her, up and down.</p> <p>He gently inserted one finger into her as his tongue continued to tease her. His fingers moved around her opening. He felt how wet she was, how hot she must be as he teased her with his fingers. He moved his mouth down. Her hole opened under his tongue. He felt her body tremble as his tongue touched her hole. He teased her, moving his tongue around her hole, making her tremble. Then he took his tongue into her as his fingers entered her, pressing against him, her pussy clenching him. He felt herself relax, surrender. He loved it. He loved how she tasted, how she moved, how tight she was. He loved her.</p> <p>He moved back up and kissed her again, tasting her sweetness there.
