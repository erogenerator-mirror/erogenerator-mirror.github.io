I was just thinking that you might like me?" said Mary gently, looking at him, not sure if she'd heard him correctly.</p> <p>"Oh you know very well what I meant," said the man, "But I have to know that what you want can never change what's happened between us." He smiled again, taking her hand and placing it in his own. "You should be proud of what you've got. We're so lucky to find ourselves in a city like this."</p> <p>Mary couldn't take anymore of his company, she was exhausted and she had little in the way of cash. "Please," she said in a small voice, "I'm begging you. I need it."</p> <p>The man, who had been watching the group intently for a good few minutes, grinned again. "Just a little incentive," he said in a deep voice.</p> <p>Mary shook her head. She couldn't think the words that fast. There was something in the tone in her voice that surprised her. Surely he was joking, but her body had already betrayed her. She was sure that she would find out soon enough. What she had to do next was simple.</p> <p>The man took her in his arms again. "You will." he said, his face pressed against her neck. He felt her body relax and her heart start to beat faster. This was it. Mary had finally made her come out, she would enjoy it. She couldn't see it from his eyes, but he knew it was a chance.</p> <p>Mary lifted her arm. He followed it with his hand so that it came up in a slight arc under his palm. Mary looked up at him, feeling nervous and nervous. He moved closer to her and she felt his breath on her neck. She felt his hands move up towards her breasts and then lower again. Mary leaned up against the doorframe and he began to squeeze them gently, squeezing them and rubbing them gently with his palms. The feeling of his cold hands against her skin was incredible.</p> <p>Mary felt an urge to open herself up and accept his touch. Her pussy was already soaked and she could feel its heat seeping into her panties. She was sure that the man that she was in love with was only moments away and probably she would be getting fucked by her very own man. She was sure that he had fucked his wife and that her husband would be a little disappointed if he found out.</p> <p>In Mary's mind her rational mind was telling her to stop this or that and just let him take her. She wouldn't do this and she knew her husband would kill her if she did. She knew her marriage was over at the least if she went to him tonight. Mary could only imagine how her life would be if she did nothing at all tonight and it would be over, but at the same time she had already decided it would not be a bad night even though she didn't care in the least for the man to fuck her.</p> <p>Mary let a sigh of relief escape her lips and was rewarded with a firm squeeze of her breasts, pressing them firmly against her bra. Her nipples responded immediately and she felt a tingle of pleasure between her legs.</p> <p>"There will be no rushing," said the man. Mary could only stand there looking up at him. "There is this one thing in this whole world that is very important. You don't have to ask my permission. You don't have to tell me."</p> <p>Mary could only stare to him and nod in response. Mary knew that even though she was sure of her marriage she would have him. She loved the fear that she felt to take something that she just couldn't do to her husband, but she knew that Mary was right and that everything she did was for her. She would never say it, but she was sure that the man that her eyes were looking for would love anything she said to him. Mary could feel tears forming and could only hope that the man that she held in her arms, would hold her until she cried for him to love her as much as he loved himself. No one could tell her how much she hated being married. They would never find out the truth behind her tears.</p> <p>"You have to be right," she said. "I can never ask someone else for anything else. It's very hard to do in life. Your help is more than enough. You have to make this happen."</p> <p>"I'm sure that," said the man, but more of an expression of shock on his face. "I'm so sorry."</p> <p>Mary knew that she had to let him in. Her shoulders were trembling and her heart rate was racing. "Thank you! Thank you!" she said as she stood up again and walked out.</p> <p>Mary could feel the room closing in on her and knew that it would not be long beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
