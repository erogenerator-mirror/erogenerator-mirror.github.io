I looked up and saw her looking at the clock.</p> <p>I felt dizzy with anticipation. I waited.</p> <p>Finally, about 10 minutes passed and I began to feel like I had been shot. And then I heard the bedroom door open and close. Her eyes met mine again, my cock throbbed and throbbed in anticipation of what she might do. Her eyes seemed to read my mind.</p> <p>I pulled my cock out of my shorts and stared at it wondering what was about to occur.</p> <p>She looked down and could already see my bulge in my shorts. She stared for a couple of seconds more before saying, "Looks like someone else has decided to do his own thing. My hand is still in it, but she is going to take care of that."</p> <p>It wasn't exactly the first time I had heard her say that phrase. On many nights I had been in the bed with my wife listening to the sounds of her pleasure. It seemed so natural to her to have to take charge, yet at the same time erotic as a bit of a dare. It was an intriguing way of communicating what was going on in our marriage.</p> <p>After seeing what I saw she had no problem seeing what I was doing, in fact her breathing became more rapid. As hard as I was to watch, my cock responded, it was hard as a rock, and even more so on that last night with her having sex with my wife. I began to move my hand slowly up and down my cock.</p> <p>"My turn," I told her.</p> <p>She was obviously thinking about what to do, as she pulled her shirt up and put it on the chair. I could see her bra strap falling off on her shoulder, revealing her breast. I had forgotten my wife's breasts until they were exposed to me. She reached up and unclasped her bra. I could just see her nipple as it poked the fabric of her bra. It was dark but I could clearly see it through the material. I could see the outline of her dark areola as her nipple poked against the fabric and her breasts. She pushed her hands into the soft material of her bra strap, letting the material rest on her arm and hold it in place.</p> <p>She looked like a woman ready to play with fire.</p> <p>I waited a few seconds and then I moved over to her and sat on the bed, not wanting to waste yet another chance to see her breasts. She looked me in the eye and gave me the most sly grin I have ever seen from her.</p> <p>She moved toward me, pulling my hand from my cock as she did so.</p> <p>I moved my hand up to caress the top of her breast. I touched her nipple with my thumb, she let out a gasp and I found myself thinking that I should make her a woman. I touched a breast on her breasts, feeling how soft they were, and how hot it felt to have someone playing with them. I moved across her chest and lightly ran my fingers over her nipple. Once I touched it it hardened and I could see the moisture on it. I slowly pinched it and she gasped again. I moved my hand back down her breast toward her pussy. I could feel it wet and her bush was soft to touch. I moved my hand back down to her stomach to where her stomach muscles and belly button met her navel.</p> <p>"Is this seat cushioned to give the best access?" I asked her.</p> <p>She moved toward me and said, "I'm sure you will like it," as she sat me down the bed. She knelt down in front of me, pulled my shorts and underwear out and opened the zipper. Her mouth covered the head of my cock and she sucked it into her mouth as she sucked and pulled it with the same rhythm she had me suck hers. I leaned back to let her get a good rhythm going, to enjoy the sensation. I felt myself start to climax.</p> <p>I had no control, I pulled and twisted her nipple with my fingernails, sending more of her toward me that I expected. Then she released it only to push it back into her mouth again. She moved her hand down to her pussy, again stroking herself in her panties.</p> <p>Her pussy lips parted and my fingers came to rest on her mound. I knew what she wanted and I began to rub her swollen clit, slowly and deliberately. She began to move her hips with my movements.</p> <p>"Keep going," I told her, "and don't stop."</p> <p>We continued to touch each other, she was now really turning me on, and it was getting harder andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
