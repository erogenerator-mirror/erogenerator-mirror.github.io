I guess most guys are naturally, instinctively attracted to a woman; which, I agree to you on that score, is fine. To be honest, there is something about this man-girl thing that feels weird. When you see a real girl there's a rush of sexual adrenaline that you can feel all over your body. You want to have a big orgasm, every time! You need to masturbate hard! I don't just mean that as a compliment, or even if you really are horny. That's how I feel.</p> <p>I'm a bisexual female, you see. I love to get turned on. I've always had a thing about anal. I can feel her tongue going deep inside me, too. And while it doesn't feel totally unpleasant, I don't really feel that I like it either. What's not to love?</p> <p>I've always enjoyed getting my cunt eaten; to be honest with you, it's never even come close to being sexually pleasurable. At first, it was so intense that it hurt to breathe. Then, after a while it became tolerable and I began to really enjoy it, too. There wasn't as much of a chance of getting a second wind as there was with the first time. I know, I know, that's probably one of the biggest misconceptions a bisexual male could imagine, but my body doesn't think much about anything except what I'm feeling in that moment. If you think about it, having a hot woman eat your cunt is one thing, but having a girl eat your ass is another.</p> <p>After that moment, there was just an abundance of things to love about it. From the very first moment I saw my lover, I started having thoughts of having a guy. I mean, really, how could I want to have sex in a relationship with a guy who could be so considerate, let alone a man I could love? But when it happened the girl's turn to go was always the next one. If this were the same as what I did with girls, I would go for it. But not a year out of high school before I met my partner and ended up marrying her. And the whole thing only made sense when I was so young.</p> <p>After all, I am technically a woman. I'm not like the guy or guy in school who I dated, although that's a definite difference. It was a pretty hot relationship and I got so turned on by it that, with time, it became almost therapeutic for me, even if we weren't together. That's when I got this thought that I would really do it with some sort of partner, with him or against him, but with me as the one who was going the whole thing, which was not a question of commitment.</p> <p>I'm sure that by now, you've probably figured it out. You've seen what I did with guys for real, I guess. Sure, in our history when I was with girls, we never really had sex, at least not as much. But, I'm no whore (in my experience), so, you'd never call it something you do. I never said it was that way, but when I did, it really got my motor running.</p> <p>And that's what I did with that guy. He and I just sort of got to know each other a little, and I sort of drifted away from the real world and into the physical experience, too. I guess you'd think that from watching a porn movie on our couch in the dark, it would have made us a little closer. But that's really not how I was acting at that point. And, it is for the both of us to figure out what it feels like to be with someone without commitment.</p> <p>So, when he brought me home for the weekend, he asked me to go shopping for clothes. And you know what, before you ask, my answer? I said I wanted to be a better date than ever before and I wanted to have sex with him. And it was the perfect thing to do in my current condition.</p> <p>It seems to me, I have been married to a girl, for almost two years. She went away for the holidays, and then a year later I had the nerve to even think about seeing him. Then I went to work, and he did the same. I really hoped this weekend would change my life.</p> <p>Anyway, back to my story. I am a man, you see, which means it would be really awkward to be with someone who has just committed to someone else. And then to have someone do that for you is certainly no less awkward. In some ways, it would be easier for me to do this, as I wouldn't be responsible for our relationship. It would probably be better if he wasn't in my shoes.</p> <p>I am an engineerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
