Oh! Oh! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh."</p> <p>"That was beautiful, baby. Now just enjoy your climax, because I want to see you cum as hard as possible and hold it."</p> <p>"Oh God! Oh God! Oh fuck! Fuck! Oh fucking God!" She continued to let the waves of pleasure wash over her body and it slowly became a continuous series of waves rising from her core and converging to build. She couldn't believe that she was cumming so hard and long. When the last wave subsided, she looked up and saw him looking at her smiling.</p> <p>"Wow." She said. "That was incredible. Thank you."</p> <p>"You're very welcome. You are truly a woman of incredible promise," he said. "As I'm sure you can attest to, we still have a great sex life, don't we?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" she said.</p> <p>"I'll bet we have more sex than we think. If the answer is 'yes," I'll bet we're even," he said again.</p> <p>A few minutes later, she looked over toward me. "I'm really happy, Michael," she said, "that you didn't do anything," she added with a smile. "We'd better get going, now."</p> <p>I was completely and completely dumbfounded, still amazed that she could let me suck her tits in public. Now she had my consent, it was just too much to imagine.</p> <p>"You're just too easy," I said.</p> <p>"You are," she said. "Very easy. And the best part would be when we get back to the party if you're agreeable."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Absolutely, very definitely."</p> <p>"Are you going to come back tonight?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I'd rather not," she said.</p> <p>I was taken aback a bit. What would we have next? We were just friends in a weird situation, and our last sex was a one-time thing, and I wasn't sure if she felt the same way. "Maybe we can try again the next time. Maybe it's already been a while," I reasoned.</p> <p>"Maybe that's the way," she said, then got up and went to the ladies room, leaving me to stare at her ass in the dress.</p> <p>As I was waiting for her in the main hall, I watched her take one last look in the mirror and smile. She'd lost a little weight since I last saw her, mostly on the back of her shoulders.</p> <p>On one hand I'd just had such a powerful cum the past two nights, but the real question was, did I have the balls to say 'No', no matter what she said? She smiled and let the thought hang in the air.</p> <p>I watched her walk away, with my cock in my hand under the table. Her ass was a little jiggly and I could see her long blonde hair hanging down over her shoulders. Was this a real or a dream come true? I couldn't have been happierâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
