He said, and went back to his seat with a smile.</p> <p>Diane pulled up, looking for the door. No one was there, and it had taken her a minute to calm down. She pulled out of the parking lot and to my condo, stopping only at the security gate.</p> <p>"Are you still there honey?</p> <p>"Where are you baby? How did you sleep?" I asked, standing as she started to open the door. I walked her out to my door with a soft smile, and sat her on the couch. There was a long glass of wine beside it, where I knew she was going to sip it.</p> <p>"Mmm... I slept like a log." She said, raising herself on the couch and sipping her wine. She laid her head back to see how she looked, and took off her robe to reveal just a tiny thong.</p> <p>"Well goody! This should do." She said with a wicked grin. I walked around the couch again, pulling her to me. I turned her around to kiss her, and moved her to the back of the couch. I laid her down and got her in position to take the rest of her clothes off. She lifted her legs up with her hands to help me. I dropped to my knees and began to lick her pussy. It was so soft and smooth, and had a slightly salty taste, but still very nice. My tongue was exploring her, and I could feel her body beginning to get wet. I continued to lick and then kiss her until she began to groan and twitch. I had her on the edge of a massive orgasm, until it exploded through her and she began to mewl uncontrollably. We both stopped breathing for a minute, and I lifted my head and pulled her to me. She smiled at me and closed her eyes to savor the feeling.</p> <p>"Now baby? I need to find some place to stay." I said, running my tongue along her lips.</p> <p>"Where do you want to sleep? We can change in the room...." I said, licking her again as I spoke.</p> <p>"I want to sleep with you." She moaned, and pulled me to her.</p> <p>"No, no, you can sleep here, if you want...." I said.</p> <p>"I want you." she said, kissing me again.</p> <p>I laid down on the couch, and pulled Diane on top of me. Her lips moved in a long kiss and I felt her tongue darting between my lips. I wrapped my arms round her waist, and held her close while we kissed. Her nipples were hard as little pebbles, and I could tell her pussy was getting wet. Her lips moved slowly to my neck, and started licking the spot where I had been asleep.</p> <p>"Yes... more." I whispered to her. She did so, and licked me hard right there on the couch. It didn't take long, and I was beginning to feel the familiar stirring in my legs, so I rolled her over on her back and slid my still-soft cock inside her.</p> <p>"Yeah... god, that's good." She moaned. I could feel her body move faster, and she began to groan even louder. Her fingers were working her nipples, pinching them and pulling on them. The smell of her was so intoxicating, it had me ready to come again quickly.</p> <p>"Oh god... I'm going to cum!!!" she moaned, and came with a shout. She was shaking with her own release, squeezing me tightly with her pussy muscles; her hot juices were running down my shaft and pooling in my pubic hair. I moved my arms, and raised her to her feet, then picked her up and carried her to the bed. As we laid back on the bed, both breathing lightly, I asked,</p> <p>"Is this how you imagined it would be?" I said, and pushed her down to her knees.</p> <p>"It would have been a lot...." I said as my cock was now hard again, and I pulled her up to my lap.</p> <p>"Baby... I want to feel that thing inside me.... fuck my pussy now." She said, and moved between my legs. "Fuck me..." I asked, and she climbed on top of me, moving the head across her pussy lips. "Please baby, fuck me." she said, and I guided myself to her. I felt her move down slowly on my shaft, until it was fully buried inside her. It was the most blissful feeling we had both experienced, and with each of her thrusts I would look into her eyes. I could see what she was trying to do to me, and knew she was trying to make my feelings with me better, making me feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
