It was long, so thick, and a deep dark shade of pink. She took her time, making it shine, and stroked him for awhile, then looked up at him when she was finally satisfied.</p> <p>"Hang on," she said. "I'll get on my knees."</p> <p>She knelt down, and took his cock once again in her hands. His head was swollen, and aching with wanting, and she took the long slender shaft in her hand and put it in her mouth.</p> <p>"Mmm . . . yesss," she sighed as she sucked it clean. "So smooth."</p> <p>"You like it, don't you?" she said, rubbing his cock against her nose.</p> <p>"Like nothing's been good . . ." he replied.</p> <p>She leaned down and took his balls in his free hand, massaging each with her tongue before she took the swollen head of his cock in her mouth. She took it in, sucking at him as she rubbed his balls, stroking him with her hand. With each suck, she bobbed her head on him, and in her mouth, but her mouth was wet and warm. She felt him begin to move on her face, and she used her hand to pump his cock.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," he gasped. "Suck me . . . suck me . . . harder . . . yeah . . . suck me . . . harder . . ."</p> <p>He pushed his hips forward and slid his dick into her willing throat, and she took it all the way, her nose in his pubic hair and her hands cupping his balls with one hand, squeezing hard. She moved a hand to his ass and rubbed his hole with one finger, then two.</p> <p>"God, yeah. Take it in you hand and stroke it . . ." he gasped.</p> <p>She obliged him, stroking him as she looked up at him with her blue eyes, which were glazed and gleaming with love. His face was a picture, a mixture of sweat & lust. His cock was thick, swollen, and aching for her. He was a wild beast, and she loved him. She reached up to take hold of his balls, stroking the swollen skin with her fingers.</p> <p>They kissed for a moment, but he could feel her soft lips and the tip of her tongue touching his cock as he began to move again.</p> <p>He lay next to her for a moment, caressing her hair. His fingers were lightly brushing down her cheek, toward her mouth. She sucked softly on his finger, and then opened her lips, letting him move his fingertip away just enough that she could take a little more of him.</p> <p>"Let me know what you think," he murmured. "I love you, too, Jenny."</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said. "I love you too."</p> <p>His fingers were now in her, cupping her cheek and kissing her throat in the hollow of her throat. "I love you . . . every night . . ." he murmured.</p> <p>"I love you too," she murmured.</p> <p>He slid one of his fingers down to her nipple. He found it erect and taut, his thumb feeling and caressing it as he teased it with his fingers.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she whispered. "Fuck me, baby . . ."</p> <p>He knelt up, his long cock in her hand. It was wet with her saliva, and he slid down a bit so that his cock slid over her nipple very slowly, sliding up and down before he entered her and back down again. It was long and slow, like sliding back-and-forth on a smooth, smooth, slippery surface. He was as hard as he'd ever been, but he wanted her so badly, so often . . .</p> <p>His cock was throbbing now, and he slid off her. Jenny was lying with her legs spread wide apart and her hand between her legs, stroking and caressing herself as she watched him. For a moment she didn't know what to do.</p> <p>"Just do what he suggested," she thought. "It will make him hot and want to screw you so bad he'll shoot his cum down your throat and knock you up."</p> <p>"If he did do this," she thought, "how would he feel about what I know he's already doing?"</p> <p>With a little more than a second's hesitation, Jenny turned her body toward him, opening herself to him. Her hand came up to caress his face as he looked down at her, her eyes full of love, and her hips rising to meet him.</p> <p>"I'm hot for you, babyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
