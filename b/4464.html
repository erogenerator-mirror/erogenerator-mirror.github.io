This would blow up."</p> <p>"I know, I know," she said looking away from me so I didn't see her face.</p> <p>"But I don't have to go, you know that."</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, I know. But I need some time..."</p> <p>"Okay," I said trying to sound upbeat but not knowing what this would do.</p> <p>"Look, you probably think it's stupid to think of me the way that I am and I understand," she said again in a very low, serious voice, "but...I just...I needed to know if..."</p> <p>"Look, let me explain. We're friends and I'll tell you if there's anything you need to know. Okay?" I said as I got up as a good natured smile and walked back to the living room with her hand going to my shoulders.</p> <p>"I love you and I really, really know what that is and I'm trying to think of a way to give you a warning," I said as I gave her a kiss.</p> <p>"Good," she said. "Let's go back to your place."</p> <p>"Sure," I said. "What are you waiting for?"</p> <p>"Well, I've been thinking about what to wear and what to put on. So, I'm putting on this..."</p> <p>The blouse she was wearing fit tight but not as tight as the one I was wearing and she wore heels that came up high on her feet and put her hair up and brushed it back as we drove to her place. I could see that she had on a pair of black satin panties with matching skirt and a black leather jacket and matching jacket as we got out of the car for her front door. I kissed her again as I reached for the laces at the bottom of the jacket.</p> <p>"Here," I said kissing her cheek. "You just put this on and come inside."</p> <p>I put the blouse on. It was short enough that it fit just snugly, and the collar cut off in back and showed off more cleavage than was quite enough. The bottom was a tight black dress-style top and I pulled the zipper up and fastened it up below her waist. As we pulled out of her neighborhood, we reached a point where it would have been impossible for us to drive without holding back the music and making a fool of ourselves. We were just getting into her living room when she said, "You know, I just feel like..."</p> <p>"You're a little slut, aren't you?" I interrupted.</p> <p>"That's what I mean," she said a little hurt.</p> <p>"No," I said. "It's really hard for you to understand."</p> <p>"But I think I know what it is," she said. "You know, it's just that I had no idea that a sexy slut like you would want to go out in a hot tub together."</p> <p>"Well, I guess that I can just imagine," I said with a laugh and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I guess so," she said as she embraced me. "You know, I've loved you for so long and now that we're here...I want to show you my appreciation."</p> <p>"I'll get your jacket, you get your coat," I said. I handed her the jacket as I held her jacket out for her.</p> <p>We got into her front door and I closed it behind us to put it on. Her jacket fit just like the way I wanted it--tight, lacy and revealing. Underneath, we were covered by a very light, black satin blouse that highlighted our cleavage, but not before turning our heads towards one another and smiling at each other's eyes. We walked into the living room and turned towards the staircase, and she turned down the stairs to the first.</p> <p>Just as we were stepping the first step into her home, I could hear the sound of the shower come on in the back of the house. As we entered the bedroom, her words of appreciation became a series of moans, and she was taking every opportunity to touch myself as she turned the lights off and kissed me as she undid my blouse. "Please," she said.</p> <p>"Please how?" I said.
