She decided that maybe he was as uncomfortable here as he was at home.</p> <p>The first few strokes were good, not the best, but the best she felt and still felt about him. She'd felt these kind of feelings before from an older man, especially one as big as the man she saw when he wasn't paying attention to the way everyone around him was looking at him. That was his father.</p> <p>At first she worried what he thought about it, why would he think it. But as she learned on many past occasions he was a very bright young man with a strong personality. After all, he'd never be the type to cause trouble around her. She wondered if one of the guards around her was ever having an affair, no matter where it came from. Did he just want some sex from a young woman? She was pretty sure that there was something in his eyes that told her there would be. She really doubted it. But then one of the guards walked by suddenly and he looked up from her ass and saw her look at him with a puzzled look on his face. He was suddenly even bigger than she'd realized, and even more frightening.</p> <p>"She's looking at me,"</p> <p>"No, I'm the one who said it," one of the guards said to the other. "Why don't you come in and we'll get a little closer to the little lady for you? I promise you will like it here with us."</p> <p>He looked at her face for a few minutes and then quickly got up and followed them. He looked at her and then walked up to her and held out his hand.</p> <p>"You're my girlfriend," he said.</p> <p>"We're not. You can't do this."</p> <p>He looked at her and then back at her and smiled again. He looked at her and then looked at her again and got a look of puzzlement.</p> <p>"I'm not going anywhere. Go stand over there," He said softly.</p> <p>She walked towards him and stood there looking at him. It was an odd feeling for her to stand there looking at him with nothing on with her eyes, but she followed his lead anyway.</p> <p>He took her face and then his arms and turned her towards the wall and then he slowly walked his hands down her arms and up her sides. He looked down at her breasts and she did a double take. He could see her nipples were hard and pushing to get out through the thin material of her blouse. He looked up to see that she was looking at his crotch and could see a slight bulging, but not quite so small, outline in his slacks.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable," he said in an embarrassed tone.</p> <p>"No. I-I didn't. I'm really flattered. I'd really like to feel your hands on them," she replied as a small smile crossed her lips. "What do you think?"</p> <p>"Well I like it from here, but I could do with the opportunity to check out your crotch, if I could just move it a little, but you have to go back up there right now."</p> <p>He took off his jacket and hung it on the wall behind her, then reached over her hip towards her and pulled her waist down until he could go between her legs. He looked up as he looked over her and then over at her face again. She saw that he was still looking at her eyes. She looked down at herself to see if it was as bad a situation as she thought it would be. But all of a sudden, as if reading her thoughts, he brought his hand up to her right breast and slowly rubbed his hand against her nipple.</p> <p>"Is this so bad? I could kiss and feel it."</p> <p>"Is this all you want?" he asked.</p> <p>"Only if you do to me as well."</p> <p>"I think that would be great. Come inside," he said and then turned and walked back towards the door.</p> <p>He quickly locked up and turned around.</p> <p>"Oh, there you are. I like you in your panties, and I like your breasts in your bra; especially in here. Do you think I could get them off? I'd just have to check the pockets and the bottom drawer. I'm sure that's it," he said.</p> <p>"I think so," she said, "I don't think that'll take much effort. It really does feel good to have these undies there."</p> <p>She walked across the room and pulled his pants down. She could just make out the bulge of his penis and she looked down as she held the crotch aside. She touched gentlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
