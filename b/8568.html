Not seeing the world like you did when you were younger,” he said. “Now I can’t find a reason not to do it, but if it really helps get me out of this funk you can look on it as a positive distraction. I mean, why not? The kids are just fine. I’m a man and can’t imagine my life without mommy. They’ll come along eventually. Just give me a chance.”</p> <p>“Do you love her?” she asked quietly.</p> <p>“Yes. We’ve been together a long time. Our marriage is strong.”</p> <p>“Do you love her now,” she asked, as she moved to press the pillow to him.</p> <p>“I think I love her in a different way. We have a lot of the same family. She has the same friends that I do. We’ve always been so close, but we don’t know if the same feelings will develop when you go out alone or when we meet new people. Even now, maybe I’m coming down with a virus.</p> <p>“Would you really like to be with a woman,” she asked.</p> <p>“I would like that too, but I’ve been thinking about you all this time. Would you be interested? If you do, please leave well alone so we can start over. We can talk again and do this again,” he said.</p> <p>They rested in each other’s arms, looking deeply into each other’s eyes, until his breathing began to return to normal. Their lips met, softly. As they parted and she felt his hand trace the soft hair on her arm.</p> <p>“Well,” she said, with a smile, “that was something I wanted to do. If you want to do the same, I’ll be happy to go out once in a while.”</p> <p>“No matter how crazy I feel, if you really want to come out, I won’t force it on you. If you think you’ll be comfortable with that, I’ll understand,” he replied.</p> <p>The smile she was giving him was reassuring that she was not going to force it on him. It did give her a sense of confidence.</p> <p>“Thank you,” she said as she moved to kiss his lips. “I’d like to go out with you again. I think a lot about why we can be so close. The next time you’re out here, if you don’t mind my asking, about you. If you are free in the morning when mommy wakes up, would you think we could do this again before dinner? I still love you so much I don’T want dinner for us. And if you want to go out, I’ll still be okay. Is that okay with you?”</p> <p>“Yes! Thank you so much.” Then he felt more reassured, as the words had a meaning to him.</p> <p>They rested some more while their breathing returned to normal. He felt she was so good to him, which is how I feel. He knew he loved her more than his own life had ever been. He did not know, or even realized at that point, just before she kissed him, that his feelings for her had grown stronger. He just felt that there was something more to her that they couldn’t quite explain, but was sure had been made in her eyes of herself. And he knew that if there ever was a time when it was better than he could ever possibly remember, that he would just need to go out with her and keep in touch with her.</p> <p>With a nod he broke off the kiss, and pulled open his mouth to share some more kisses with her. At that point, he felt his cock stirring, and wondered what the big deal had been about it. It felt very wrong to feel anything sexual with a woman his mother as opposed to the very sexy mom he loved. But, he felt that he should be a bit more honest with himself. He knew that even though he loved her, he didn’t have a relationship with her. They had never been anything other than lovers. Neither of them had ever had an affair, never considered such an activity. And even though that made them both happy, it felt different—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
