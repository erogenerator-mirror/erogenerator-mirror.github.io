You know, I've known this guy for at least a year and a half or so. He's always had a thing for you in the past, but I kind of assumed it was just friendship, like we're all friends. Is it true or are you just trying to be sexy?</p> <p>Bella: Sorry dude. It's just a joke man. I have never had a guy try to flirt with me though. It's not a big deal. It's kind of fun. So, um, can I ask you something?</p> <p>Alex was shocked, surprised and intrigued and he looked down at his phone. He couldn't believe what he was reading:</p> <p>Bella: Well, I was just checking on you and I was thinking maybe we could do something else.</p> <p>Alex couldn't believe what he was reading. He had never been very attracted to other girls. He just never had the guts to do it. That was the kind of thing that wasn't really happening at all. He looked back up and noticed that she had gone off the bed and was staring out at the sea before settling back to watch a movie on her laptop. Alex, that was such a weird day. He had just gotten the most amazing and erotic thing he had ever read and he could do nothing but sit there thinking about it. But then he noticed that she had turned and was looking at him intently for a few moments then turned back and started walking up the stairs to the bedroom.</p> <p>Alex: You're up there, girl. You want to do something sexy for him?</p> <p>Bella: Yeah and yes, I mean, I think you know, I mean, it's kinda kinky, I guess. But, I might be a little weird, too, don't you think?</p> <p>Alex: Right with me. I was wondering if you're a dyke. That would be a very weird topic. If you're not, I guess we could just do it at home. I don't do it alone though.</p> <p>Bella: Oh no you don't, it's alright. I love you and it's okay. You're just so big and you have a really good body. I promise if you like, I won't be too worried about it. I love you and I think it would be alright.</p> <p>Alex: Well, I've always sort of known you're different. Maybe it's not so strange with the way you look, the way you smell and you can even come, you know, just to me. You're so pretty and you have a nice little tittie. That's great.</p> <p>Bella: And, thank you so very much for being my roommate. And, you're such a great guy, and, you've done this before. I'm happy for you Alex. I've never done anything like this before. I'm just kind of new to it. You can tell me. You'd be really cool to hang with someone new who likes to flirt. It's just like we've been friends and it's great.</p> <p>Alex was stunned and shook his head as he felt himself go rock hard in the chair. He couldn't believe that this was actually happening. He would feel awkward having something like that to pass up. Not that his current girlfriend ever said that. Alex felt a lot better after a while, which was probably because, he had had sex. He felt better because of what was happening. He felt much better for it. But then he saw her smiling at him and realized suddenly that he was still talking on his phone and not a picture.</p> <p>A few minutes later, he noticed that it was getting dark, so he decided to just turn it off and let it fall asleep. He just sat there, looking at the night sky as he had this crazy thought that he just wanted to be with someone and then he felt a light bulb go on in his head but he couldn't quite make a good decision. Finally, he said "Damn," and walked upstairs to his bedroom. He took a shower to clean his body up and put his dress on before going downstairs. He went to the door and peeked in and saw a girl that he didn't know and he felt like his heart stopped and stopped.</p> <p>He put his clothes on and walked to the front door to make a knock. When it was opened and she stuck her head in, she looked over at him and shook her head but her eyes were bright and she gave him a huge smile, which he couldn't take back. He got inside the room and closed the door behind him and he could barely make out her in a dark room with two other guys inside.</p> <p>She looked around and he saw they weren't in the bedroom anymore so he walked into the livingroom to see what was upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
