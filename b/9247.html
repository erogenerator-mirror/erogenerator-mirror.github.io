He could feel as much breast flesh as his hands and cock did. He tried to lean down and lick her nipple to get it hard again as she ground against him to get him to lick her there. There was enough light for him to see the swollen head of his cock and she felt his tongue press against her nipple. Her legs squeezed together as she felt him sucking on her now, his other hand pulling up her shirt, squeezing and pulling at her nipples which were now hard and pointy and sticking up at him. She heard the slurping sound his penis made as she pulled at his tongue, forcing more and more of it into her mouth.</p> <p>He pushed his hips up slightly then, pulling himself from between her legs, his cock glistening, glistening with her juices. He pushed his head against her lips again and she felt the throbbing of his prick against her clit. She was still holding on to his head, her hands gripping at it with a fury as her hips rose to meet his, their tongues thrusting into each other as they began to fuck each other with their tongue. She pushed her mouth against his and sucked him back inside as he pulled out, pressing himself against her body as he began to rub at her back and breasts with one hand. His other hand pushed in a line down and slipped between her legs to feel her clit, stroking it as he felt her body tense and her insides tense and tighten around his stiff rod. His fingers pressed hard against her and her body tensed as his cock throbbed hard within her and she knew he was about to come. His hands cupped her ass, holding her still and his face against her as his semen pumped into her, his hips pumping and his hands squeezing and pulling at each spurt. She felt herself gush in response and knew that they had to stop and she would be able to breathe. She kept his face against her as he pushed his hips back and forth, pressing the head of his penis against the folds of her vagina lips as he pumped his cum into her, his hands still squeezing and pressing at her ass.</p> <p>As he slowed, he pushed himself back a little, lifting her shirt away and his lips from her breast. She felt the cool drops of sperm dripping down onto her skin as he pressed his own, feeling its sticky heat. He looked up at her as if there was some unknown meaning behind them and she kissed him. His arms fell back to his sides and he lay back, his face next to hers. He kissed her for what seemed like forever as she stroked his hair and kissed him, her tongue dancing across his lips as she tasted herself and him. He was a man; a lover and even a lover and she knew with a little certainty that she would never be a lover of him but had been since he left her. She felt his erection and moved as she lowered herself onto it - the soft feeling of her vagina on his cock and lips and as she sank down onto him, the wonderful warmth of him surrounding her as she held him against her and kissed him. She felt his kiss as he kissed her, as he held her and as his hands pushed at her back.</p> <p>As his kiss ended she felt him move slightly. He pressed himself into her, just slightly, just enough to feel the pulsing in both of them that had begun to build. He kept moving up and back, pulling and pushing on her body, trying to get all the way up over her. He felt her muscles squeeze his cock as she tightened her lips. She felt as though she were going to climax again, just on the first thrust into her, the first thrust into her body and even that seemed to be the most amazing orgasm she had ever had. Her body responded quickly, her hips thrusting up to meet him and she heard him groan against her.</p> <p>Their bodies moved over one another as she kept on moving up off of him and then off of the bed. They had done this several times and it seemed that in each time, the same feelings were there. As he felt himself stiffen against her, she felt herself tighten around him and then she began to come with him, her body twitching and jerking on top of him as he groaned against her lips again. The sounds they made - his groan - were music to her ears as she felt herself contract around him and she felt herself relax again, sliding along and onto him even as the pleasure of it hit inside her. He leaned down as she collapsed ontop of him and held her tightly while she felt her orgasm continuing to wash down into her as she kissed him again, her kiss full and passionate.</p> <p>He felt her relax for a second and lay up on his elbow, leaning against her so that he could kiss her again. He held on to her as she sat upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
