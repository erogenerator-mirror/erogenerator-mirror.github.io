I spotted all sorts of things. This was what I'd been waiting for.</p> <p>"Come inside, and take off your clothes.</p> <p>I wanted to fuck you right here, as we'd been lying in bed.</p> <p>But I was too embarrassed. "Why?" I thought out loud. I don't want to fuck you."</p> <p>"Why not? So we'll have a little fun?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she said, "we have more. Why are you so shy?" She asked with a teasing smile. "If I didn't know better, I'd say you're the one with a virgin."</p> <p>I took a step toward her. "I've had lots of guys."</p> <p>"Then you've got it."</p> <p>She moved toward me, and kissed me, her face almost close to mine. "Would you go for it?" she asked teasingly. "You don't have to, if you don't want to."</p> <p>"No!" I said sternly.</p> <p>"I said go. Now. Go."</p> <p>Her eyes showed that she really meant it. And then I went, in all my nakedness. She came to me, and we kissed again. She was as eager and eager as before. She put one hand over my bare, naked breast when she saw where my hand was already covering my pussy. She wanted to see. We kissed and touched, and stroked. Her hands were already on my pussy now, and I wanted her fingers to join mine inside my pussy.</p> <p>I didn't tell her that she was making me so anxious. "My turn now," she said. I got on the bed, with my bare legs on the other side. I lay back with my legs apart, spreading my knees so my pussy was just about open. I moved my hands to her shoulder for balance. She moved closer to me, and started kissing my bare pussy. She kissed my pussy lips, then her mouth found the entrance to my vagina and started licking. I was surprised by her taste. I really hadn't had much taste before, and now, as she licked me, it was more than the taste of my pussy juices.</p> <p>I felt like I could cum. Her tongue was driving me crazy, and I was moving my hips to meet her every thrust. Our kissing and her tongue were turning me on. Suddenly, she stopped moving. "Oh, god," I moaned at the loss of her tongue.</p> <p>I was disappointed when she put her mouth on me again, but also kind of excited by the loss. I wasn't ready for that, but her face and her tongue had me wanting more. She came up my body, licking the skin of my thighs, making me shudder with delight. I ran my hands over my own breasts, kneading them, pulling on my nipples until they were hard as rocks.</p> <p>I knew that the last thing I wanted was all her tongue. My legs were spread as wide as they could go. When she had my bare pussy exposed, I felt her fingers at my pussy lips, playing around. And now they were playing with my hole, touching my hole, probing. And she was teasing me with her fingers, slowly and tentatively. My body was alive with pleasure and fear, but even that felt good.</p> <p>"Put the end of your finger inside me," I begged. "Please!"</p> <p>She started slowly, moving her finger around in me, and then slowly, a little harder. My pussy was wet, and she was moving her finger in me, in the same way as she had my finger there before. She kept it up until I was pushing my hips up, trying to keep it in me and touch me. It went into me nicely, and her finger went deeper. I moved my hips as she made her finger move and caress my pussy walls.</p> <p>I loved the way her finger felt inside me. My pussy was alive with passion, with anticipation. I was close to cumming. I tried to put my hand over mine, but I couldn't move. The pleasure I was getting was too much, and I wanted more. She was moving her finger in and out of me, very slowly, just as she had before. I could feel them touching my pussy walls. I could feel them stroking me, and I had a great orgasm. The way that her finger was moving inside me made me cum as hard as anything I'd ever had.</p> <p>"You really are wet," she said when my body had finished coming down from its high. She kept her finger inside me. "You sure are, aren't you. You really feel like you're having fun!"</p> <p>"I did!" I was surprised that she was calling me that.</p> <p>"What have you been talking about? Didn't you call me â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
