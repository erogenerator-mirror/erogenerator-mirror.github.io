"So," I said, "what do you think? Is it a big step?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, and kissed me on the back of my neck. "I think. More to your liking it depends on the people involved." He was looking in my eyes and I knew that was a mistake. I opened my mouth to say something, but as if I was about to say something else, he placed his hand over mine and silenced me. "It's not about the people involved," he said.</p> <p>"You don't know my name," I said, and he nodded slowly. "Are you interested in working with me?" I had already made my choice, and the thought of the whole situation actually appealed to me. I looked down at my hands and started to reach for my shirt. "No," I said, "I'm still not sure about this."</p> <p>He looked at me with a quizzical look on his face, "what?" I said, as I started to fumbling with the buttons on my shirt. "Do you want to be naked with me?" I did as he said, and watched as he slid his own pants down, leaving him in his boxers. He lifted his legs off the chair and sat down on the floor and stared at me with those big green eyes. "No, do you want to be naked with me," he said.</p> <p>I couldn't help blushing. "Yes," I said. "I will," I turned away and leaned over the arm of the chair. I undid the zip at the back my dress and let it fall to the floor. I was standing next to the couch looking at him with my ass facing him. His eyes grew wide as my eyes met mine. One of his hands slowly moved up my thighs and I looked back at him. "Come with me," he said. I turned, walked over to him, and stood up next to him. He reached up and pulled me to his lap and kissed me again, not gently this time, but with a very deep passion. When his lips touched mine it was as if he was trying to devour me. The feeling of his hands touching me while he looked deeply into my eyes made me tingle. I opened one of my hands to touch his and he pulled it away from his face and looked at me. When he looked back at me, he said, "I didn't think you would like the idea of being naked with me."</p> <p>"I just couldn't," I said. "I'm really not a girl that likes to be naked in front of others."</p> <p>"Me neither. Your body is beautiful and it makes me want to do things to you that I never do." I turned to him and put one hand on his thigh. "Let's get this coat off of you and sit on the couch. It's time for our first lesson."</p> <p>We sat on the couch and I took his shirt and laid there for a minute, not saying anything. I could see he was thinking about what I had just said and knew that what I had just said was going to happen. I thought back to when I had been naked. Back to watching him undress me in the mirror and doing things to me and I had gotten to be really turned on. And while part of my mind still was telling me that just going through the motions had the potential to make his sex life with me extremely special; even after doing things I had never imagined doing to others sexually in terms of my own, but that thought was dashed back to the point and I felt myself trembling, trying to keep the excitement I felt off of my body.</p> <p>"How do you like it so far," I said, "and will you let me do things to you that I already know how to do?" "You want me to do things to you that you'd never do to me?" I asked. "Well, I do," he said, "but I also have something to tell you about how it is. I am very, very excited about being naked with you." I felt myself blush and he reached out toward me to stop me from moving. "Here," he said, "let me run a comb through my hair." He ran the comb through his hair and his eyes seemed to be staring at my nakedness in the mirror, "I love it when people stare at and think about me like that." I could feel my face heating up again and started to feel a tingling between my legs. "This is so exciting," he said. "If you don't mind me saying so, do you want me to finish this hair when you're done? Or did you want to do it while you're down here?" I didn't want to say no to what he had said, but it was kind of hard to say no to his hot, dirty talkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
