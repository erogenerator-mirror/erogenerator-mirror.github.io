He asked as he pulled the car into the garage.</p> <p>"Maybe it was because of my job." She shrugged, "If I drove it all on my own it would always be on my own, but no, we can make that happen, and if you're really lucky, I may even let you see the world."</p> <p>They were sitting on the front stoop at the garage in the garage of their house by now. Tom had to take a deep breath in order to control his excitement.</p> <p>"I'll let you go and I'll lock up, lock the doors and lock up. I'll see you later. I promise."</p> <p>She smiled and winked. She walked quietly upstairs to her room and shut the door. She took a long deep breath before she turned back to him.</p> <p>"When you got back, let me go put on some pants."</p> <p>Tom took her hand and led her into the living room. He watched her slowly bend over to put on the pants. When she turned back, he stared. She had put a nice pair of panties on, and her legs were lovely looking. As she bent over to adjust her own skirt, Tom pulled the thong back up on her legs. Then, he ran his fingers through the crack of her ass and he was immediately rewarded with a wonderful view of her pussy, the panties sticking to it. He didn't think she would be into the whole thing, but she sure looked like she was. He watched her face as she pulled on the pantyhose and pulled the blouse down over her hips to the floor. He could only imagine, just one of the things he'd enjoyed.</p> <p>"Let me go get a shirt that comes up well." he said.</p> <p>"Sure, that's fine if you're going to stay for the meal." He smiled as he went up the stairs to the master bedroom and made himself comfortable on the bed.</p> <p>He was already up to his second half when he heard the door open and a voice call his name as she came down the stairs. "Come over here."</p> <p>She stopped in the doorway and sat on the bed, looking around the room. "I was worried that you couldn't wait until next weekend." She smiled.</p> <p>Tom sat up to his feet and took her hands. "I'm very happy that you went through with the plan with me. Did you tell anyone else about it, about us fucking?"</p> <p>"No, not really, but this doesn't sound like much of a party either." She took his hands and kissed the palms. "I've been looking forward to tonight."</p> <p>"The dinner party then." He laughed. She laughed too. "Well...this evening sounds like fun..."</p> <p>"Sounds like fun to me too." She took his hand and looked into his eyes. "I do promise to try to make it at least as fun as you're making it, and maybe even MORE fun. Come back and we can share the rest of the evening."</p> <p>She got off the bed and went into her suitcase to pick out a couple of outfits she might fit him. He walked her back to the bedroom, put on his own clothes in record time and headed to the kitchen where she had the water on in case she was hungry. He came back and grabbed a bottle of wine and poured them both glasses. By the time she was done and had poured each of them, he was feeling pretty tipsy.</p> <p>"You are quite the romantic."</p> <p>"You're not so bad yourself. And, I bet you're looking forward to it."</p> <p>"I certainly am. Where do you think we're going?"</p> <p>"You know the place that's right over to the right and out back. The pool is nice and secluded."</p> <p>"Mmm, sounds fun. This is a great place. I have to do this for myself too if my life revolves around staying here. But, no time like the present."</p> <p>Tom followed her out to her car. "If they have the pool, I might still want to stay."</p> <p>She opened the door, leaned in and kissed him. "I'll be back in two days. If we get too crazy, call me, but let me know the time, OK?" She leaned against his shoulder and they walked back to her car. "I love you, Tom. Just promise me that you'll call sometime and we'll have a fun time together."</p> <p>When she was in the car, she smiled at him. "I really like that. I love you, and I would love for you to call."</p> <p>"I really do love you, Janice."</p> <p>"I love you, also. I wish we could spend as much time together as we did before you called."</p> <p>"I know you do." heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
