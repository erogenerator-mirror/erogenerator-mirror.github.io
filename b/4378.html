She knew she had a better chance of managing to win him over. They had agreed to become an exclusive and exclusive couple, but she was going to be his wife anyway. She enjoyed being a free spirit for herself and, although she preferred being alone and in control of her desires, she felt good when his cock was in her mouth or, rather, in her pussy. She loved being his woman.</p> <p>He was having problems keeping his erection away. The only thing that seemed to deter him was the constant feeling of a hard cock pressing against his thigh and, as it was now, his cock rubbing against the front of his pants whenever he made the most of his opportunity.</p> <p>"Take off your panties," he said gruffly. "I'm going to find a better position for you."</p> <p>She looked at him and slowly pulled the panties down her legs. He made the occasional approving noise as she lowered the panties onto her feet, but then he was up to his knees as ordered. He pulled the chair back towards him and knelt beside it with a hand behind his back so that he could rest his head on the cushions. Leaning over he kissed her with urgency to get her more than slightly aroused. She enjoyed his lips and his tongue probing her as she pressed into him with her own. She knew if she had not been so turned on she would have been on fire by now, but she had promised she wouldn't come and she wasn't going to wait. She had promised it earlier. She wanted her lover to stay that way from now on, to take her over the edge and then fuck her hard. No way she was going to let that bastard come home to her.</p> <p>Miguel pulled her closer and kissed her more urgently. He pulled his mouth away and looked at her. "I'm sorry. That was totally unacceptable. You said otherwise." She looked down at his cock and the bulge in his pants. "I wouldn't ask for that. Please don't make me beg."</p> <p>Then she got up and hurriedly went to the door and closed it. Then she was gone again.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I had no idea it was just a quickie," he said.</p> <p>"You don't have sex with me then," she accused him. "I like sex better when I have a man around. You're already in love with me. I'm married now and the man is my husband."</p> <p>"That wasn't the point. I thought you felt something for me that you don't. Well, I guess I'm sorry," he said.</p> <p>"That's ok. I can wait till you're inside me. I guess I'll call you next time. It's been so long."</p> <p>"You don't call? Well, I hope I can persuade you. I've wanted to do it for a long time but never you being with a man, although you haven't taken the time to make up for it?"</p> <p>"It's just that I wouldn't want to lose you."</p> <p>"I think it's very sweet of you to share yourself with me and so I guess you should," she replied with a laugh. "It doesn't mean I'll keep doing it. And if you have anything left it would be nice if we could get together again. It's been so long since we're together and I still love you."</p> <p>She reached for his tie and pulled him up on to her. "If this is a one time thing and I'm not going to make it a permanent thing I'll try to not make it a permanent thing. When you've had your fill of being my sex slave I've made it up to you." Then she moved his hands to the belt of her robe. "I've even put some clothes on before we've been together so you'll be looking good in the robe." She looked at him. "So, you like it a bit of a change, don't you?"</p> <p>He looked at her confused. She'd never expected to see him in his uniform. But that was the way it would go. It wasn't like they just got up and did sex together and never did it again, but the time had come for him to try it but as she'd said, he had to have some patience. But then she was the one who was supposed to be the master of this affair. So it wasn't like the guys her husband knew. He would have to be the guest and keep her on her own. "I just thought.... you might want to..."</p> <p>She smiled. "Well, I'm sure I could persuade you," she said as she sat down again. "You can try it. You can make love to me while I'm in the robe and I'm sure you won't mind. In fact, you've got toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
