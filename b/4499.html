Your mistress is the mistress."</p> <p>"Yes, master. I will serve you in any way you wish."</p> <p>"And I will use whores, too. My slaves will service me. So many of them. You think you can be just such a master?"</p> <p>"As you wish."</p> <p>The next two weeks passed quickly. I would be working at the local brothel a lot. I kept a watch in the distance. It was a few hours later when I was about to meet a client at the brothel. I stopped to buy a drink. My name was on the line to him. I thought, "What's a guy to do?"</p> <p>We met at a pub when I was a young child. He was tall and handsome. He introduced himself as Tom, short for "John, but more often, Ron" the only name to get. He had dark hair that was combed back and was cut short. His eyes were big and his expression seemed a bit disarming. He was also about fifty years old. He was smiling.</p> <p>"Hello, John. Please forgive me, but I haven't seen you here before, but I knew you would be a nice companion tonight."</p> <p>"Hello, Tom. Thank you for coming to my humble abode."</p> <p>We chatted for a while and then he asked why I was in the bar. When I told him no, he took the bar sign for me and asked me to sign the register. He then left. I was surprised. He seemed to be expecting me to be his new slave.</p> <p>He asked me if I would like a drink or a cigarette. So I went to the bar. Tom was a good looking man. He was also a man I couldn't stand without a cigarette or a cigarette. I found the bar and ordered an expensive drink. By the time I finished sipping my drink the bartender was back. He poured the drink into a brand brandy flake. I took the flake, put in a drink and went back to the bar. My second drink was just about finished. The man at the bar seemed almost nonchalant. He said nothing about my visit but asked me a lot of questions about my life. My first guess was because of my previous master. He seemed to have a little accent from my previous encounter.</p> <p>The second drink was just a small but strong brandy. I was hoping it was a drink of some kind. When I finished the brandy drink, I told all of my questions. The man kept flicking his cigarette at me. I couldn't tell if he was looking at me or my glass. I kept a close eye on him. In the back of my mind I kept hoping that the flake would fall far from my lips.</p> <p>I finished the second drink. I felt quite relaxed, but I also felt a little drunk. I left the bar. The man who was flicking for me was waiting outside with my drink. I went back to the bar. I sat down on a stool. My drink was about two inches from my lips, which were still red.</p> <p>I felt as if I was going to puke.</p> <p>"Hello, John."</p> <p>"Hello, Tom," I answered.</p> <p>"Please meet my little slave. I heard your little 'talk'. I've heard it a lot."</p> <p>"Yes, sir."</p> <p>"My name is Sam."</p> <p>"I don't believe this. No man in his right mind would put his foot down like that. It's true. You can be just such a pretty slave. My slave is a lucky one."</p> <p>That was enough to send me over the edge. I just sat there in my seat as if I was suddenly out of my mind. All of a sudden, Tom appeared with two fresh bottles of brandy. I was surprised when the man at the bar started pouring a brandy. He said something but I couldn't make out what it was. He offered me a drink to sip when he finished my glass. I did not want to be a burden.</p> <p>I was still stoned and was still surprised when I drank the brandy. I didn't want Tom's brandy to fall on my head, but it didn't seem to matter. My mind was spinning at the thought of drinking so much. My mind started to float away. It was like I was being transported back to the point where I first met Tom. I really don't remember what happened after that.</p> <p>Later, I finally fell asleep. What happened was not in the world of my dreams or my imagination. My dream felt like a different world. I was a different person.</p> <p>On a cloudy Saturday in late October, an acquaintance of mine asked me toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
