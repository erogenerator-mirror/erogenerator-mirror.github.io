"Are you okay?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm fine," I replied, but only for a second before he walked up to me and reached down for my dress.</p> <p>"If we go to bed you won't be wearing any," I told him, meaning it.</p> <p>He hesitated, but gave in, "Yeah, I think we'd better, I love it. We'll just go."</p> <p>"Okay," I nodded. We went to his bedroom, and I had the light turned off when I closed the door, when we pulled up to his door.</p> <p>"What are..." he started to say, but stopped himself at the sound of his voice.</p> <p>"Are you ready? You haven't left, have you?" I asked, putting down the dress off the bathroom counter that I was carrying. I could see her reflection in the mirror.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, reaching for the dress. "Let me put this on."</p> <p>I found that I couldn't get it on fast enough, and after I tried, couldn't, it was too much to just take off the dress and put it back on again. I did and we went in his room to dress.</p> <p>"I'm going to put this on, too," she said, with her arms folded above her head.</p> <p>"Okay," I said and then, again, puttered along behind her into my room.</p> <p>I donned my boxer briefs and put on my pants. As I'd hoped, David was sitting quietly, drinking what could only be called coffee, the mug, which I'd taken in the toilet. I wasn't sure what to do. Was he going to say something? Was she going to go back in? Was she going to leave? I was already beginning to get worried that David would just take it. I was even more worried when she reached down and grabbed the hem of her dress.</p> <p>"David," I said. "I can't."</p> <p>"That's because you can't."</p> <p>She reached out, and held me for long moments. The warmth of my arms was spreading quickly to her arms. Then she lowered the gown, holding me in her arms. With a sudden movement, she lifted me to her and, without a word, we fell on the bed together.</p> <p>"I never did this before," she told me one night, as she pulled me down to kiss me, my own mouth. With her arms wrapped around me, she held me as the kisses got more passionate.</p> <p>I held her the rest of the time until we had to go out. She left a note, when to stay. I had never met her before and even though I knew it was just a chance encounter, it had been a moment that I felt the last few months.</p> <p>"Where will you be?" I asked, as she pulled up short.</p> <p>"That's easy," she said, holding me tight and pulling my head down. "I want you in me, tonight."</p> <p>My erection didn't last long. But it did, when she kissed me. I was on my back and her on top. My hands were moving on her. We kissed some more, and then I found the nipple and rubbed it with my thumb. Then I let my head fall back and closed my eyes.</p> <p>When she kissed me again, I opened my eyes and looked down on her. I saw that she was smiling at me.</p> <p>"I didn't wear this for this reason, this was a gift for me," she told me. "And thank you for it, I really do want you. Now, can I go again?" she asked, lifting herself up so her mouth could find mine.</p> <p>"You're my first," she said, with a kiss and a smile.</p> <p>I was too tired to be mad, so I asked. "Do you want to be alone? Or with someone else?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she said, giving up. "I want to keep you."</p> <p>"Okay, do it with a friend. In other words, no, you can't go with anyone else," I told her, even though I was excited thinking of her having sex with someone else.</p> <p>As she moved to get up, she didn't say anything, instead she pulled me on my back, spread my legs in the air, grabbed my shaft, and lowered herself onto me. She started out slowly and I got to feel the heat of her, the moisture and the wetness of her as we were joined together.</p> <p>With more urgency, she got her hips down, and we started to screw that way, slowly at first, then more quickly, making noises and sighing as we moved together. My hands found her breastsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
