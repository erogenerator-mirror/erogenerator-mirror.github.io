I asked. "How will you be able to work on the house?" The thought of moving it out of the way was all that was bothering me. My mother worked at a bakery.</p> <p>"I don't know, Jack, I just..." she leaned forward and gave him a smoky look. "Maybe we can work on the house before we have to take off... But, if that doesn't work out-" I watched as she nodded at him. "But... maybe, we will." She hugged him, and he wrapped his arms around her.</p> <p>********</p> <p>It was getting to be a little routine for Jack. He felt so much like his father. Now that he had been accepted at this bar, he hadn't felt like the only single male in the bar. It was just that his father was still in his late fifties. Jack was always making plans with his friends. But, as he watched the time tick on the clock, his father seemed to leave Jack with something that was more than a passing interest in him, and his plans for the future. He was also his father's favorite father. He thought it was cute, and he knew that. He thought it was hot, and it seemed as though the boys were just not interested.</p> <p>After three weeks of this life, Jack decided to just relax and see what happened when he looked back. What they do to each other is called seduction. Jack was used to it. He had sex with two women before, but never a man. He would have to let his father know the change that was going on with his father now.</p> <p>After a few weeks of watching him, he came across a picture of him, and of his father. It was a snapshot that he had taken when his mother had passed away. His father was older than his. His father had worked as a cashier at a restaurant. They had been happy as mother and son for over ten years. Their little home sat next to a lovely property. Jack had seen pictures of it many times. It had a full view of the garden, back deck and the back yard. On the left side of the house Jack had seen the house, and on the right side he had seen the driveway and street. Jack had been drawn to it. At a different time of the day he wouldn't have noticed that his father had gone through the front door or the back door. He knew it was the property, but now he was wondering how much it would mean.</p> <p>Jack had always gotten an interest in his son. If ever something was said to him, it sure as hell was nothing more than the last few weeks. He had met and talked with Mary, and his father had told him. He had felt almost like his mother. Jack had felt like his mother had walked on to Jack in some way that never really made sense to him. Perhaps it was his father, and somehow, it was because of him alone, but he knew it didn't matter if anyone could get to him or not.</p> <p>When the doorbell rang, Jack thought he was going to get up and run, but he just sat there in his chair, and waited for something to happen. What Jack didn't know of his son was how much Jack loved her. Mary was older than he, and her hair was longer, but had a lighter brown color that was always worn back. Jack's mother had been the first to give Jack her ring. Now, Jack had a picture of his mother standing next to him, and he was wondering if it had been him.</p> <p>His father came up and stood in front of Jack's chair. Jack thought he should run, and then Jack thought he should run to Jack and hug him. Before Jack could even say anything, his father wrapped his arms around him.</p> <p>"I want to give you something important," his father said in a quiet, warm voice.</p> <p>"You won't tell anyone," Jack said. "Not even mom."</p> <p>"No, Jack I won't. I won't." Jack's hand was a blur, and his father didn't miss a thing.</p> <p>"You can't," Jack whispered. "If you don't, I won't. I will tell you no, and you'll have to let me go, but I won't."</p> <p>Mary sat down beside Jack, and as she did, she leaned forward and kissed him on the lips. Jack, who didn't know about kissing or anything else, simply wrapped his arms around his father. The kiss started out with the feel of his father's warm hands on his bare back, and it lasted for long, soft kisses and light caresses. Jack knew he shouldn't be kissing his father, but he couldn't help himself from returning his father's kiss. After Jack was done, he let out a soft cry, and his father pulled him to himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
