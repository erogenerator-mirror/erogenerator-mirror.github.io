Maybe just a little too long. And, maybe, that wasn't all that, was it?</p> <p>To tell the truth, I didn't pay much attention to what they were saying and I didn't want to give anything away so I said, "That's OK, honey. It's all good."</p> <p>He responded with more enthusiasm than usual and I tried to keep my head where it was as I watched my wife's eyes grow more and more excited with each new word she spoke.</p> <p>"God she's so fucking sexy, Tom. I can't wait any more!" she almost whispered then reached to pull her blouse away from her breasts and out of her skirt...</p> <p>I was surprised at what my face said...and then what it didn't. But then I remembered I was right in my wife's mind. And the look of astonishment in her eyes gave me strength, too. "Wow, do you recognize that look? Wow, did you see those breasts?"</p> <p>"I did...but, now that you mention it, I'm not sure I did."</p> <p>I felt myself turning crimson as much as I was embarrassed. "No, honey." I didn't want it to come off as 'weird'. I didn't want it to come off that way around her as she said it. But...I was not sure I wanted to find out about that...</p> <p>Linda just watched me with her arms in the air as if she didn't really have time to react to my statement. Finally she smiled and said, "Oh, good. I never knew..." Before she could finish she said, "Well, Tom."</p> <p>He looked at her and saw exactly what she was asking.</p> <p>"Is he hard?"</p> <p>"God yes. It's obvious he loves to watch his wife get fucked."</p> <p>He couldn't seem to move as though he had a brain in his skull. "She's an amazing woman."</p> <p>"...but she's also an exhibitionist...and a slut," I thought.</p> <p>That made a lot of sense to me because...</p> <p>Tom started to look around the room more...but then she said, "No, baby, it's not the 'lifestyle' or the 'dressing', but the 'dressing' part of it. I want him to watch with me."</p> <p>"Honey," I asked, "is a show really worth watching?"</p> <p>They both stared at me as the question came.</p> <p>"Well, why not?"</p> <p>"Because I want to give him something to watch." It took me a while to grasp what she was saying because it was suddenly like I had been caught making a mistake.</p> <p>They both looked startled and looked at me for a second then turned and faced each other and both burst out laughing.</p> <p>"I didn't mean you'd laugh," Tom said as he stared at me.</p> <p>"You don't have to be an old man to do that now," Linda laughed as she turned and headed out the room in a flash. At the door she looked back and stopped, paused, and then said, "Tom, where did you get that 'we need to talk' look?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I stammered. That was one of the most unusual questions I'd had in years.</p> <p>"Oh, sweetie, I'm serious. It means that I want to watch a lot of porn and I want you to watch it with me so that I can tell you."</p> <p>"But I was, too, I mean I'm not sure I would want that kind of...you know...sex...in front of you?"</p> <p>"Oh, no silly. It doesn't really matter to me what you think I'm doing, just do it. No one would ever know. Okay?" She was looking at me nervously and then looked back over her shoulder at her husband. He was still laughing and holding my hand lightly. "Come on. You're not finished yet. What more do you want?"</p> <p>"Well, you know that I...I never..."</p> <p>Linda had moved closer to me on the way out of my sight, "Come on, honey, it's time to put those clothes on."</p> <p>Without even being asked, I stood and started to pull my shirt and pants back on. She laughed and then said, "No, not on our honeymoon."</p> <p>Before I knew it, they were both out of the room and walking toward the door. When they came back I pulled my wife close to me and started to kiss her. They seemed to melt into each other and I could feel our bodies.
