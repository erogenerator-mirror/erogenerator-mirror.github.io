I had just slid my pants back on when she pulled up.</p> <p>"Is there anything you want in the wash?"</p> <p>"No, I'll take it in the bedroom and get the soap."</p> <p>When we got into bed she was already hard again. She went to her knees and took me in her mouth, but soon I was stroking her hair. She knew exactly what to do and soon I was moaning and groaning as my cock throbbed and spit the soap in her mouth.</p> <p>"Is this what you wanted?" she asked before sucking me back to hardness. "Your cock, in my mouth," she ordered. She took me back in her mouth and sucked until I was close as I exploded.</p> <p>"You sure you're okay?"</p> <p>"I think I had too much. It wasn't like you said."</p> <p>"Let me know if you want to take a pill."</p> <p>"I would really like that," she said, and we had sex again that night.</p> <p>As the days past, the night I'd come home early and found the woman I'd always dreamed of sucking me off had passed out in bed. She hadn't come to. Her voice was quiet. I think she had been watching some TV. I just didn't know what to do. I hadn't meant to come all over my fingers like that.</p> <p>"I thought you were home already," I heard her say. "I was about to turn in. You okay?" I didn't want her to see me touch myself again, but she wasn't in her room watching a movie or watching the porn videos; we just stayed up all night doing what we wanted.</p> <p>"It's okay. I've wanted to do this for years, but never thought I'd enjoy it."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>"I was just thinking. You still are, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said after a pause.</p> <p>"So you didn't think I would come in and you'd change your mind?"</p> <p>"Of course I did. I loved it. I didn't know you liked to do that."</p> <p>"I love it, too. I guess I'd just been waiting for your response. I can't believe anything came up I told you I thought you were home earlier. That was your first week at work. It might have taken a dozen calls to get you to ask me out."</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"Why do you think, at first, the thing was to tell me you liked it?"</p> <p>"Because you're right, I do like it. I can't say that I've never liked it, too."</p> <p>"But you're right," she agreed.</p> <p>"So we can't do much?" I asked.</p> <p>"I wouldn't worry," she said, and we kissed. "Besides, you might really want to do it again now that you're home."</p> <p>"Just to see if I can still keep up with you," I told her. She got up and we showered together, and we kissed a lot. At one point she rubbed her hard cock against mine and said "Can we?" and went back into the bedroom.</p> <p>I got in the shower, and we dried off until I was hard again. We had made love again before, and she couldn't resist taking me in her mouth.</p> <p>"You've always wanted to do this," she said as she came to my head and put me in her mouth again. "But nothing could ever bring it into the bedroom where it should have been."</p> <p>"That's okay, because I don't want to think about it anymore."</p> <p>"Good," she said before pulling back off and stroking me again. Her hand got me as hard as she always could.</p> <p>"Will you do it again?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know. I could never find the courage for the whole thing."</p> <p>"I'll never find the courage."</p> <p>We both laughed a little.</p> <p>"Come on," she said when we were through.</p> <p>"Are you leaving?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Good," she said, and her hand went to her mouth, leaving me alone in the shower with her. As I took my place in the tub, she took my hand to bring me into the shower a little closer. I was still hard, and we didn't have to be shy about it. Our hands lingered on each other, but nothing else. My cock slid in and out of her mouth, and she swallowed me a little bit.
