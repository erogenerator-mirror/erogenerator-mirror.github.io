Was the steward a good man?" I asked, watching him get a cup of coffee.</p> <p>"It was okay, so I guess it was a good flight." He said, still leaning over his desk.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes it was. Was your friend there? Did he give you a ride?"</p> <p>"No. I'm fine. I guess it's the long distance flight." He said, looking at his watch. "I just have to call him and see what he says. Can you give him the number?" His phone had started buzzing.</p> <p>I got up, still smiling and went to work but I felt his hand on my shoulder before I could say anything.</p> <p>"What is that feel? It's nice." He said, touching lightly.</p> <p>I felt the hand press my shoulder and turned towards him.</p> <p>"It's nice." He said, putting his hand on my neck and smiling. "This is nice."</p> <p>I reached forward and pulled him down for a kiss. His lips pressed on mine, his tongue slipped in and found my lips. I opened my mouth, my tongue slipped out and swirled into his mouth. His hand found its way to my hip and pulled me close to him. He pulled an ear up and whispered, and I just nodded.</p> <p>"Is he home?" He whispered. I was sure I heard him call my name as he was pulling me away from the desk. His kiss had me shaking. When he let me go he pulled me tight against him and turned me towards home. He opened the door and was going in.</p> <p>"Can we get out of here? I want to know if that man is still here." He said, looking out as I got out of the car.</p> <p>"Let him come inside. This is his place. I'll just drive him back to his hotel." I said trying to convince him.</p> <p>"No. Let him sit in his car. He doesn't own a car, and he doesn't drive his own. He doesn't do anything except drive." Jim said as we walked into the house.</p> <p>When we got back to the room, I let my shirt drop to the floor, leaving my breasts exposed.</p> <p>"Now what?" He asked.</p> <p>"I want him, now." I said. He led me by my hand into the bedroom.</p> <p>"I thought maybe we'd shower together and go to the motel." He said.</p> <p>"No, no. That would be cheating." I countered. "And I didn't think we could keep this from you. So let's see." I said, opening the door.</p> <p>I walked past him and took off my clothes. I sat down on the bed and pulled him on the bed with me, pulling him with me. I let my hand slide up his thigh; my other hand held his neck. I let his hand roam over my breasts. He let it slide up underneath my shirt. He caressed my breasts through my bra. They were already very swollen and swollen, I could feel them quivering. He dropped a lick over my nipple and it rose up to meet him. He let his hand slide past the cups of my bra and cup to my breasts. He let his hand slide back down over my belly and let it continue down and down over my panties. He slid his finger over my hot wet slit. I lifted my hips, he lifted out of that chair and let his finger explore me. He put his finger in my mouth and told me I was as aroused as I was. He knew he wasn't the only one excited, because soon I realized that just the sight of him was too much. I looked at him and said,</p> <p>"If you want to go further, you'll have to use a condom." I teased.</p> <p>"Yes. Just tell him."</p> <p>"Don't forget about your condoms. When he comes home, he'll know it and then he'll get to fuck you again."</p> <p>"I want that too." I said, taking his finger and rolling it around in my mouth, sucking on it and then kissing it. I knew he liked that. I could feel his cock begin to swell against my leg.</p> <p>"I was going to ask when so we could stop before his car starts to go." I said.</p> <p>"That would be great." He agreed.</p> <p>We began to kiss again. My hands on his head, he kissed and licked my breasts, sucking on my nipples. His hips were grinding into mine. I slid his shirt and I slid my hands up over his chest, down his body until I could cup his hard cock. I felt his fingers in my hair, pressing my face to his and let his tongue slip in between my lips. I let my tongue swirl against his.
