Our lips were just touching as I slowly let her head rest on the cushion before leaning down and sliding myself inside. The tightness enveloping me felt amazing. It felt as if she could feel every vein through me. I stopped for a moment just to savor the sensation of her around me. Then I began to move slowly in and out. The feeling was absolutely incredible.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes I became quite turned on as she was pushing away from me. I sat there on her for moment as she enjoyed herself. I leaned forward and kissed her and then began moving in more deeply with each stroke. After a few seconds I pulled all the way out and then slammed myself back in as we began to make out again. I felt totally and completely in love with her.</p> <p>It wasn't enough to let her go, though. I took her hips in my hands and started moving faster on top of her. I leaned back and she lifted herself up so I'd enter her again and we continued to make out again. I leaned over and began kissing her neck and then worked down her body to kiss her. I began to run my tongue around her breasts before moving back to her nipples. I alternated up the strokes between kissing and licking as she moaned in pleasure. After a couple of minutes I brought my hand down to work on her clit. The feeling was incredible. After a minute or so I rolled her over, I was kneeling over her, still in our kiss, with our bodies locked together. I began moving, slow and steady, in and out. I moved my hands down to her ass and began to squeeze and play with the smooth flesh. She made slight whimpering noises as she arched her back a bit, to give me more room to move into her.</p> <p>When she was ready for me to really start to pound her I lowered myself back down and began to rub her pussy. It felt as amazing as I had imagined. It was still wet from my earlier thrust and it felt amazing. I was still trying to decide where I wanted to go. I had only been pounding her for a minute or so, now it was time to turn the tables on us. She seemed to be feeling the same way. We stayed that way for a long while before she began to get into her rhythm. I pulled out, she turned over and I entered her from the back. We had made love before but never this intensely. All this had made us the most compatible, loved the most intimate, and wanted to spend as well as want. I loved making love with her. We both had so much love and affection for each other that we couldn't imagine life without it. I loved that I was able to do this with her.</p> <p>We were both very aware that as we approached our climaxes the pace would increase as well. But we wouldn't stop there. We continued to try to make each other come. After a few minutes of this beautiful feeling I was about about ready to come myself. So we got down on top of each other then I reached down and pulled her down on top of me. I knew that she was more than ready. I kissed her to let her know it and then I guided her down on my cock. The feeling was incredible. Her pussy was so wet that the head of my cock was now inside slowly as her inner walls stretched to allow me in. It felt as if our bodies were being joined by our souls. The sensation of being inside her was even more intense and my hips began to move to meet hers. I wasn't the only one moaning a bit as it was very sensual and pleasurable.</p> <p>She knew that I wanted her to cum again too. Our movements began to become more urgent. We moved together faster and our kiss became a feverish, deep kiss. She moved both of her hands down to her pussy grabbing all of the juices she had leaked onto me that day. She moved one of her hands to her breasts and was caressing her nipples. The sensation of her fingers was the most amazing, intimate feeling ever. The way she was moving caused my cock to move faster in her love tunnel. I was moaning for us both to keep going as long as we could. I knew that I was really getting closer to an orgasm. If this was an orgasm we would both enjoy too. I felt myself start to grow as my cock became even harder and longer inside of her. Our moans, our touches, and the incredible feelings we shared were pushing us towards our release together. She was moving harder and harder. It felt as if we were moving at the pace as we had been for the last hour or so.</p> <p>I couldn't believe what I was feeling. Our bodies were now moving together harder and faster. The pleasure was like nothing I had ever felt. I was lost in the moment and completely in love with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
