"John, how would you have felt if I had come in here and said you were gone for some strange reason? Did you ever wonder why it was you didn't come home at that time of night for me?" I said it to shock him but I didn't care as I saw what he looked like with his short auburn hair sticking to the back of his head and his light blue eye shadow, his black jeans with little blue and white polka dots and his dark blue shirt looked better than jeans.</p> <p>He wasn't even aware of the time so I asked him if he would like an early shower. He said he would as I got up to open the fridge and the wine I always loved was in the bottom drawer. I wanted him back and if I still had him I would not get drunk enough.</p> <p>I poured him a glass and he told that he would love a glass of water. I looked him over and got down on my knees and as I took one to his feet I kissed the insides of his thighs just under the material of his denim shorts. That made his cock grow hard against my mouth as I slowly unbuttoned and removed them, his cock almost falling out of his shorts. He sat back down when he saw me strip off my clothes in the front of my bedroom and I knelt on the floor between his legs. I could see the outline of his cock pushing outward from his shorts so I opened his shorts and his cock sprang out, it was rock hard, thick, long and hard. I ran my fingers up the outside of it and kissed my way down his cock until I was at the base and then, with my lips, I softly kissed the tip of his shaft.</p> <p>He had his eyes closed in ecstasy as I kissed and licked his balls and then moved up to tease his cock with my tongue tip. I felt that it was getting close and knowing that as soon as I put it in my mouth I would have to pull his legs farther open to make him come. He was moaning now and I knew, he wanted me to suck harder, I needed to make him explode. And I knew he loved to suck and when he was on the edge I kept rubbing just the tip into my mouth and kept sucking the tip as I slowly slid down the whole length of his cock, his entire cock disappearing in my throat. My hands worked the base of his cock as he got harder by the second. It felt like a velvet glove was sliding up and down his cock, I wanted to swallow every last drop of his juice but he couldn't stop me. I could feel how hard he was and knew I had to have it. But then I stopped moving my mouth up and down on his cock as he felt the end of the finger that wasn't on his balls slip into his ass. He groaned as he felt the finger slowly stroke his prostate as I kept sucking his cock, then suddenly, the finger was gone from his ass and he had to ask if I didn't want him in my mouth. "No, I want to taste you," I said as I licked up the tip and slowly took his cock in my mouth so he could see.</p> <p>He watched as I got him prepped for my mouth and then, I took the head of his cock and ran my tongue down the underside of his shaft until his cock was completely in my mouth. I was still sucking his cock so it didn't take long for him to have his cum filling my mouth as I pulled all of it out and swallowed it all. And as he felt me sucking him dry again, the moment he left my mouth and slid back down the full length of my body I wanted his cum in my body.</p> <p>He slowly rolled off of me and I lay on my back as he took me in his arms and slowly moved on top of me, rubbing both our bodies as their naked chests rubbed against each other, I could feel the heat of their naked skin on my body. We kissed, slowly as our bodies pressed against each other, he could feel my tits pressing into his chest and could feel my tongue lick the tip of his lips and then push itself into his mouth. It was not a kiss but more like a quick little thrust with his cock in my pussy. That was my lover and soon I would be his love slave.</p> <p>He started riding my body, first sliding the full length of his cock in my pussy, and then sliding all the way down so I could feel it go deeper in my pussy then he could in my mouth. I could see that his cock was sliding in and out of my pussy. It felt like a glove was squeezing my pussy, it lookedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
