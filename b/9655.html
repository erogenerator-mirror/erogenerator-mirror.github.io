But I needed to be told.</p> <p>“You know what I’m thinking; it would probably be better for everyone.”</p> <p>We shared an embarrassed laugh and then she told me to get over there and start stroking. I was more than ready for the hand job she gave me. To my surprise, she started to massage my stomach at the same time.</p> <p>“Oh, do that now—you’ve reached the end of my belt.”</p> <p>And I did. I slid farther and farther down. I rubbed hard now on the fabric of her panties. They were soaked as well. I could really feel her bare skin pressing against my hand. It wasn’t long before I started to feel the soft underside.</p> <p>“Oh you got it bad? You like to massage my clothes?”</p> <p>“Mmm, yes I really do.”</p> <p>She must have guessed I liked that and started to rub faster. The combination of sensations made me feel like a kid in a candy store waiting for the return of candy and suddenly I remembered something.</p> <p>“You do it for me; I could feel it last night with my fingers.”</p> <p>“Oh yes; you can do it.”</p> <p>“I’m sorry now; I’m not used to receiving hands.”</p> <p>“I’m not sorry. You are a beautiful young lady, and I’m very close to you. But I love my hands on you. Do you have to stop before they feel so good?”</p> <p>“Oh, I’ve never done it before.”</p> <p>“We could both do it, and then, maybe, just hold off until you can really feel me. My hand is good. Does it feel good?”</p> <p>“Yes—oh I’m really getting excited and I don’t mean just with my eyes and hands. I want it all.”</p> <p>“I’m almost there too.”</p> <p>“Oh good—I need you in me now.”</p> <p>It took a great effort to keep from screaming so loudly, but she managed it. We held each other tight. A few minutes later she told me to roll over to face her. I did just that, rolling over on top of her. As our naked flesh pressed together she began to feel warm. Not like I did. The warmth and wetness felt good.</p> <p>I could feel her breasts against my chest. I could also feel her body heat as it pressed against me. At the same time I could feel her breathing on my neck. Our mouths met in a long passionate kiss. I could smell that musky fragrance of passion in her breath.</p> <p>Now that we were both so turned on; we both needed it so much, I could taste her. I pressed my body into hers. I could feel the heat of their passion. And then the soft skin of her cheek against mine, she turned her head for me to suck on her lips. And then they parted and our tongues could play with each other. But it was more than just our tongues touching. Soon, we were making love in a different style of passion—kissing was all good, but kissing, when it seemed like something more. Our kisses began to get into sync, and our kisses became more frenzied.</p> <p>This kind of kissing could not last long. I was in that trance of desire to feel her. That, and feel her body on mine. But it was not to be. She said we could stop if felt uncomfortable—she said just to enjoy it.</p> <p>We rolled onto our side. We were still in her arms, but the passion inside me had completely ebbed. We lay back and smiled, just looking at each other.</p> <p>“Is there something else I should do to you.”</p> <p>“Yes.”</p> <p>“Can we do it again?”</p> <p>“Yes. If you put your mouth on my pussy, you’ll do it right.”</p> <p>“Okay.”</p> <p>She smiled, and got up to get something to eat for dinner.</p> <p>I heard the sound of her going around the house, and then she was back on her back on the bed. She was lying with her legs spread wide. The skirt fell on the floor. Her legs were open and I could see the pinkness of her pussy lips, and the moisture of her sex. I thought she would take off my clothes and take me to paradise.</p> <p>And that was exactly what I was about to.
