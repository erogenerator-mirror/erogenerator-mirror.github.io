Oh, sorry, I've been out here for a while looking for, um..." she trailed off uncertainly.</p> <p>"It's my place," I replied.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think I meant..."</p> <p>"Well, I should, anyway. Please." I felt her face blushing slightly.</p> <p>I had no idea why, I thought. I'd had a couple of girlfriends in my high school - girls who'd been in close relationships - who'd dated men who wouldn't get their dicks sucked on them. I think that was true of a lot of the people in my class, but as of today, I found the concept of having a girlfriend fascinating and the thought of having such a relationship with her very, very interesting.</p> <p>As I pulled a blanket out and some towels out of the bathroom, she followed me, and they joined me, standing in the tub together. I let go of the towel that had been hanging down between them. They both sat on the blankets and looked away from me for a moment, and then the two girls went to the opposite sides of the tub facing me.</p> <p>I had never been close to so many girls at one time - but the image of the three of them, standing side by side, as they looked at me, the sight, the smell of their sex, with a very active pussy was just something that I had wanted to do for a while, and here it was, with their naked bodies, in the tub. A minute ago, I was so self-afflicted, being in the school playground, having my ass burned, and then a friend had helped my parents get me through a horrible, long ordeal, in the back room. Now, I just stood, watching them, and trying to look the other way without looking like I was really interested in what they were doing. I really wanted to get closer to them, if I could just go somewhere and be with them, but the idea of leaving my room for a while was making me hungry again, and getting out of the swim room was just not going to happen.</p> <p>"So..." I said tentatively. "I have to ask something of you here, and you have to answer it without looking like you're interested in doing anything. Is that fair?"</p> <p>They both nodded, the redheads looking away and the redheads looking back at me. I could feel my heart beat and swell as it started to jump, and I knew my penis was sticking hard against my swimsuit and was throbbing in anticipation.</p> <p>"I'm not interested in getting anywhere with you, either," I said. "It's for the best to let you know who I am and what I'm doing."</p> <p>"Oh, that's nice." She nodded. "I'll take that as a compliment."</p> <p>"You're kidding?" I said, incredulously.</p> <p>"No, seriously, actually."</p> <p>"But, I'm pretty sure I'm not interested in any of you girls." And as they both started to look me up and down again, I said, "But I think I could use a friend... here."</p> <p>I reached behind myself and slipped my suit off, then started soaping up the backs of my own thighs. The redheads started to back away further, but I stopped them and put a hand to the back of their heads. "Wait, I don't want to get you mixed up, just in case you want to just, uh..."</p> <p>"Just go with it, if you want to." They all started to back away, but then they looked back at me again. "It's my turn," I said, leaning forward and taking one of them gently by the hand.</p> <p>"You're... you're... you're just going to kiss it, right?" she asked, nervously.</p> <p>"That's fine." I took her hand and they moved their heads, and her friend moved with me and stood in front of me. She smiled, her face almost in line with mine, and I bent my head closer to hers. I kissed her and it was amazing. It really wasn't an awkward kiss. It wasn't, as I would expect, a lot of tongue and lips. It was definitely not a quick kiss, and as our mouths separated, my penis was starting to swell more firmly than I had expected.</p> <p>"Mm, uhh..." She started to turn to look at me, but then stopped. "Wait... stop," she said. "It's not so important."</p> <p>"Uh, sure." I was still sort of holding it in, so I just stood, smiling at her, and she smiled back.</p> <p>I stepped back and looked again at their facesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
