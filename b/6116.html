I'm not like you. I'm more of a friend of yours." She put her hands on mine and squeezed my hands again.</p> <p>"Well, of course I'll tease you back," I joked, "But it doesn't really mean that, does it?"</p> <p>"Well, it sort of means that I shouldn't have brought my cell phone home from school. I guess we should call the police after all."</p> <p>"You still aren't going to do that?"</p> <p>"No, what kind of teasing games are you playing?" She pushed me back off of her and then stood up, "I thought you meant that just with me."</p> <p>"We'll see. I'd love to tell them. But I'm going to put on a show for you, I promise. I just wanted to see how my friends would react. Then I had this idea that maybe this time you could tease me back. Would you like to try?"</p> <p>She reached up and gave me a hug. "Just one last, wild one. Now go get me my cell phone, and be sure to bring it home so I can keep it."</p> <p>"Ok, I'll try," I said as I walked away.</p> <p>I pulled onto my street and made my way to my place as I was walking through the house. I closed my car door and looked around to see if I could find my cellphone. I didn't see it, so I drove past it and then took my things from the car and started on my way to the door.</p> <p>As I was pulling out of the driveway, Linda stopped me. "Hey, baby." She was standing in my doorway, hands on her hips. She had a look on her face of disgust. She looked up at me and shook her head at me.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I asked her as I moved toward her.</p> <p>"Nothing," she told me, "I just wanted to make out with you. You were always so nice, and now I know that someone just wanted to have sex with you. I just don't want you to do anything stupid."</p> <p>I hesitated for a minute, "I'm not going to hurt you, Honey. I just feel that you needed help. I'm not going to lie to you."</p> <p>"Do you think I'm stupid?" she asked me as her eyes grew warm. The thought that I might hurt her didn't bother me, so I decided to try.</p> <p>"Yeah, you really ought to see this guy, one of the guys from your class who lives down the street. He seemed to be just looking over my books in my library when you knocked at the door. He told me that he really likes you, and I told him to let you in."</p> <p>As I spoke, I walked over and reached over the kitchen table and turned on the light. As I was doing this, I reached up to Linda's face and caressed her cheek. It was a soft touch that I found that I had grown to love. I turned her face toward me and kissed her cheek, gently, then kissed her mouth as I ran my tongue up her chin to her neck.</p> <p>"That's so nice," she said as I gently kneeded her breasts in my hands.</p> <p>I pulled on her nipples gently with my fingers as I kissed her neck and then moved away, "Let's have a drink, then dinner."</p> <p>"I'm just going to sit there while you get dinner ready," she said as she stepped toward the master bedroom.</p> <p>"Come with," I said as I helped her onto the bed.</p> <p>As she lay back, the robe rose up over her. I put the robe on the floor then undressed. I sat in front of her on the bed and looked down at her. Her face was still flushed and her chest was heaving as she looked at me with a look I had never seen before. I wondered if she saw what I was seeing. She looked so vulnerable.</p> <p>I put my hands on her sides and rubbed the front area of her body. I had to stop before she became too excited. "Honey, I'm going to have a little dinner," I said as I moved my hands to the front of her legs. I pulled down the sheet and saw that she had removed the sheet in some effort to keep it from opening up, which was a good thing. She was lying there naked under the sheet. Her breasts stood high on her chest and jiggled as I ran my hands all over themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
