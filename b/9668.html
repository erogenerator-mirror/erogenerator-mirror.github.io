She got up, threw on a pajama robe, and went to the mirror to check herself out. She turned all the way around to just stare at her reflection. Her black hair was up in a loose ponytail that cascaded down onto her shoulders. Her green eyes were still as blue as the mountains, with just a bit of that same iris that she had seen yesterday. "Now where were we?" She said, slipping back into her nightgown. She got herself off into the hamper while getting ready to cook the next day.</p> <p>After she put her head in the oven and began to prepare the salad, she was about to have an early lunch to deal with and wondered if she could get someone to take her to the mall for shopping. Then she noticed her phone, but then, she didn't even know who it was. She grabbed the phone and just looked at her current phone. "Damn."</p> <p>She had been in her room for nearly ten hours. She had to have at least one, if not two people, in there. One minute she was on her computer at the local mall. The next minute, she was at a large mall with a sectioned off food court. One moment she is standing right before the food court, and next moment, she is walking out of the food court on her way to the food court. She quickly looked around for someone.</p> <p>The next few minutes were pure hell. What the hell was she going to do? But then as if she couldn't find anyone, she got there. And she found someone to give her advice. She took her lunch to the food stand in the middle of the shopping center. One moment she was looking at two men. Then she was going to run to her car. She picked up a pack of panties and put them on. She walked to the parking lot where a black limousine waited. She took the limousine and pulled out.</p> <p>Once in the limo she got her head around the fact that she would have to run in that state and be in this car in all of it. She just wished it would go faster. She was at her house in twenty five minutes.</p> <p>She had just taken a bite out of her sandwich when she heard the muffled sounds of her computer. She looked at the clock and saw she had almost a full day ahead of the shopping spree and decided to pick up a couple new magazines today. She smiled at herself and went back to her computer.</p> <p>She got up at eleven and headed to the grocery store. She bought everything within reasonable reach of the cashier. Her mind was not focused enough to register. She pulled out a bag, packed it up and headed for home. She got her bags in the car and was out of the car at a quarter after one o'clock. She was in the driveway, going up the stairs to her bedroom when the doorbell rang.</p> <p>She was not shocked. She knew that it would be someone from the mall or even someone from the office. She was used to dealing with the most important people in her life and it was her neighbor's son. She got out of the car and was about to answer the door when she saw it. She smiled to herself. "Hello?" she said, almost out of breath.</p> <p>"Oh, hello!" answered the voice behind the door. She stepped aside because it took her a while but when she opened the door there was a woman standing there. "Yes, I was wondering if I could get in for a few minutes," she said, looking directly at her face.</p> <p>"Uh...sure."</p> <p>"Can?...can I get in please?...please, let me in?...please"</p> <p>"Oh...sure, of course."</p> <p>There was a few minutes of silence while she tried not to think about what might happen next. The moment passed.</p> <p>"You'll be in here a long time..." The voice started.</p> <p>"Uh...ok..." she said while taking one last look at the woman who stood behind the woman.</p> <p>"So, I figured you two might want to come in and get into some more privacy. I'll just tell her we want to talk and I want to talk to someone."</p> <p>"Well...ok then." she said as she took the coat off her arms and walked into the front room.</p> <p>"So I guess we've crossed that line. No harm, no foul. What's the problem?...what's wrong?" asked the male voice.</p> <p>"Well, let me fill you in. We have a woman...a very beautiful woman. We decided the best way to approach the situation was to wait until after she had her own little talk with you before making any decisions."</p> <p>"The last you know is right after she met you. You're marriedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
