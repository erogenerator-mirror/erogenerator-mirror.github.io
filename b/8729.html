He had a big bed and was using the bedspread to wipe the last of his cum that had already been shed on the sheets.</p> <p>"We'll take a break and have some fun, shall we?" he said. "After all, you are such a hot little toy and this might not be so bad. Come lay down on my bed and let me show you what I'm going to do..."</p> <p>As she lay naked on her bed, he got into bed beside her. They cuddled and kissed for a long time, then he slowly climbed on top of her. He took her hand and led it to the tip of his cock. She felt his wet cock against her thumb and it became hard as steel. She put both of her legs around his waist and they began kissing again. He guided his cock to her opening and the tip entered her. It slid in with little resistance.</p> <p>"It's okay." He said. "No pain." He started to fuck slowly and they continued to kiss each other. He reached down and began to rub his fingers over her nipples. He could feel her getting more excited by the second. She began to writhe under him. He felt that he was getting closer. He picked up his tempo and began to move faster, more quickly with each stroke. He could feel she was getting close. He picked up the pace and felt her pussy muscles tighten over his cock as he thrust faster.</p> <p>"Oh yessm! Oh yessm!" He could feel the cum rising in his balls.</p> <p>He increased the pace and felt her pussy tighten around his cock while his cock began to spasm. He held still for a moment and then pulled his cock out and aimed it at her belly button before shooting a load all over her belly. He continued to rub his cum all over her belly, thighs and pussy.</p> <p>They laid there and kissed again then he got up to remove the covers from her bed. Then took the vibrator and began fucking her slowly. She felt pleasure as she lay there, her hands caressing his back and backside. Then she felt his cock being pulled back into the wall for a moment while he slid it slowly towards her opening. Then it slid deep inside her.</p> <p>"Let's do this again one time!" he said.</p> <p>"I think I'd like that." She said as she opened her lips and slowly took his cock in. He began fucking her harder.</p> <p>"God you feel so good in my hand!" He exclaimed and continued his thrusts. "Oh God you feel good!"</p> <p>He was moving so fast that she was afraid that the head of it was going to slide off her pussy but he continued to give them a rest. She began to feel the waves of pleasure starting and felt herself rising to another orgasm.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around his waist and began to move her pussy against his cock and felt him begin to thrust faster and harder while he began to spurt more cum inside her. They rolled to the side and kissed and held each other.</p> <p>At the time of this happening, Bill was the one sleeping in their bed. He awoke several times each morning to think of the evening, and to have that erotic image of his beautiful bride, naked and ready to be fucked, filling his mind for a long time. He got up to go to the bathroom and his hand brushed over the head of his cock. He had another go at it when he heard a bang. This time he went to the window to see who it was. His eyes met the reflection in that large mirror and saw himself on his back on his own bed. As he looked at himself, he saw his naked, sexy wife, who was also naked and on that bed waiting for his big cock to take her. He was shocked at how much he had enjoyed it.</p> <p>He got dressed and went to work. He did not think he would have a hard on until the next day, but he was surprised by what happened instead. He realized that his cock had actually grown, and not long after, it actually became harder.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh my God!" He said to himself, as he opened up his pants to the point of pain. He pulled the covers back over it and went home, and began to think about how he had been able to get his cock hard again without getting caught. He had never cheated on his wife. She had always been the one to initiate it. She had always seemed to be so very open. He really didn't know why she was asking him to fuck her again after so many years. She had never seemed as happy as she was. She had always said that she didn't want to feel guilty about it.</p> <p>It didn't seem that way to Bill. He had never been able to get a hard on like he was now.
