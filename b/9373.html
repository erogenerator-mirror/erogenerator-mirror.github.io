We both said at the same time with a kiss.</p> <p>I wasn't really ready for a second one from a guy but as it happened, I didn't mind. I enjoyed each kiss. The guy kissed me first, first on my left and then on my right.</p> <p>The kisses were short and he only took the chance to give me a little bite here, a little nibble there and I was liking it, so after a moment the other man did the same. He just took the chance to give the attention he was giving to me and for the next 15 or so minutes nothing else happened.</p> <p>He then turned to me and kissed me lightly on my lips.</p> <p>"Are you ready to get off?". he asked, and I nodded, and I was happy that he was being truthful with me. I thought about lying; I think I did.</p> <p>As he kissed me again, I took his hand and raised it towards my lips. I looked at him; I was enjoying the kiss. I was happy so much that the first man's hand was on my crotch and that it was moving on the crotch of my jeans, and I liked him doing it on me.</p> <p>There were just two or three kisses before he removed my hand, removed his hand as though he were putting it on some sort of a medical or medical experiment, and put it on my shirt.</p> <p>Our clothes were gone and they were all over the room. We made our way to a chair and we sat in it, he kissing me again, and I kissing him and kissing him, then we were kissing again and I kept on kissing him. We were touching each other again, but it didn't take long before we were touching each other again and again.</p> <p>He was sitting in the chair, but the other man was straddling him and riding him in a position of mutual satisfaction.</p> <p>The guy's hand slid around my breast, and from underneath my shirt he was massaging my other breast. It felt very good to me, but I also felt like it was being too sensual, like some sort of sexual experience. While our kissing continued, our hands still were playing with each other and he was making no move towards getting us off.</p> <p>I was enjoying it too and as my hands were moving everywhere, I was feeling really good. I was getting close, so when the other guy touched me just once I almost came there and then. I put my hand over the other guy's and kissed it, and as I kissed him it took a while to reach mine and his and that was it. Both of us then opened our fingers and we were kissing each other on both nipples, kissing each other there at the same time. He put his hand on my crotch as we kissed. He was doing it on me as though we were trying to make a connection. I was feeling really nice.</p> <p>We continued kissing from there, still kissing, and when he got his fingers in between my thighs I thought it would be too much to take but he kept on kissing my lips until I was on the brink. He then put his fingers into my pussy just as his other hand was inside mine and I had my first orgasm as a result, which made me feel that I had to have more.</p> <p>He then sat up and said, "Let's see what else we have to offer here: some more orgasms!"</p> <p>"Sounds great" I said, "I could really get fucked by someone else."</p> <p>We kissed again and the two men were now rubbing each other's thighs and I could feel they are wet also.</p> <p>Now they were both on the bed on their backs. They were looking towards each other, kissing and rubbing each other's breasts with long strokes of hands.</p> <p>They were lying side by side, and they didn't have much to cover. It was a gorgeous bed: one with just two and no bed covers for my head. Both were naked.</p> <p>The other man went on a 69 and as he got between them, I felt his hand on my breasts and one of them rubbed my pussy for a while. I was getting aroused also and he was just rubbing me. I saw how it felt, and I like it too, and he kept on doing my breasts.</p> <p>They took off the clothes of the other and he looked at my pussy, took off his own clothes and joined me on the bed and as he got closer to me, I put them on my head.</p> <p>"Suck my breasts" I said. I like to do this when I do this with my hands. We did that the first time.</p> <p>I then bent at the waist on all fours and gave the other man aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
