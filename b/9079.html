I hurried back to my office to change my clothing and get the stuff I needed.</p> <p>My mind was spinning and I was in a constant state of arousal. My pussy was a swamp, the smell in the office was a dead give-away that I was aroused. In the middle of the office I saw a stack of bills and the sight would send straight back into my pussy. I picked it up and put the stack away carefully, and then proceeded to return to my office with my clothing.</p> <p>I looked back over the pile of paperwork on my desk and it was obvious that someone had just taken the whole of them. Just that thought alone brought up several more thoughts and I was in a state of shock from what the other day had wrought in me. I hurried to the elevators and hurried to the elevator as quickly as I could.</p> <p>The elevator took my feet with me as I slipped out of the elevator with my eyes wide, my palms glistening. I sat down next to the cashier, who asked with a wry smile</p> <p>"Did that happen?" as I handed him a few dollars.</p> <p>"No, not at all," I said, my face turning to meet his gaze and we exchanged a quick grin.</p> <p>He took a paper out of his bag and handed it to me. "Here, I bought you another one."</p> <p>I looked down for a moment and said, "I'm sorry, I didn't realize that was you. Here, take your money, you can cover this with anything you would like, just ask."</p> <p>He looked at me for a moment, then he quickly slipped out of the elevator and across to my office where a stack of bills was waiting for me in my hands. He quickly slipped it into his pocket and handed my money back to the cashier. And then he disappeared. As he walked away from me, he turned and looked with a look that said he had seen me, and wanted to know just what I had seen.</p> <p>After all, it's been awhile, and my pussy still gushing with excitement, and I thought that had just happened. So I stood up and hurried to my office and got a pen, a pencil and paper and quickly finished the final checks in the deposit box that I had to close at the end of the day.</p> <p>After giving all the statements and depositions, which were now closed as well as finalised, I checked out the rest of the day's work for the first time in a long time. I also finished on time and it was already 8 o'clock, so I was going to be late for work. I was in turmoil and was very excited. I just couldn't let the evening take away from the excitement of what had just happened, especially when I could now feel my pussy tingling and making that tingle that I had seen in my mind's eye.</p> <p>I had a quick shower, a quick brush with myself and headed out to the parking lot... no, the main building... the first floor of the main building. As I walked out to let myself in I could see the building was nearly empty so there was no need to rush. As I entered the lobby a woman sat at a desk and watched me as I passed by and then she raised her head, waved and moved on.</p> <p>After an hour of waiting I walked back to the elevators as quickly as I could and slipped off the elevator and found a parking space behind the next building. In an instant I grabbed the box that was still sitting in front of me, stuffed it into my suitcase and then stood there for a few moments before opening the door.</p> <p>I looked at the door in my hand and sighed. Just how far did this go? So far? I could easily have put up with him for months and never let him in to the office again for fear there would be more people that I never expected. I sighed again as I turned the light on in my case and then pushed my suitcase shut and locked the door. I had to admit, I had been a bit of a surprise to him. But for now I just hoped that he didn't start anything else.</p> <p>While still staring at the door for several long moments I heard him walk across to the elevator. After he had opened the elevator door and stepped away I looked up to see a pretty redhead on his way home. I smiled to myself. We could certainly get together sometime. I wondered though if I were able to get away with this. For now at least I was going to enjoy that thought for the evening and leave it with him.</p> <p>The elevator doors opened and I stepped out with a sigh of relief and then quickly opened the door for him along with the rest of my thingsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
