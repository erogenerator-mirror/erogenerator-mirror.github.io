She made me wear things like jeans and a button up shirt and when I asked her what she was wearing, she laughed and told me to go buy herself one. After a few months I started to take her to a few dinners at local bars in the hopes that I could seduce her, although I wasn't ready for that yet. One night she invited me over to her house for a drink and after a few drinks we were both tipsy and horny. Then she dropped a bomb on me.</p> <p>When we were alone and she told me that her ex was cheating on her, I couldn't believe it or what she'd done but when she talked it seemed like I was finally seeing her for who she really is. With her sitting next to me on the couch, she started to unbuckle my pants and undid my belt and zipper.</p> <p>"My son's right upstairs!" she said, "We've been talking and now it sounds like you're finally getting laid." She slid her hand under my boxers and squeezed my cock.</p> <p>"I knew you were excited." she said, "But how did you know about him?"</p> <p>"You and you. We talked about him a lot..."</p> <p>"And then we talked about other guys, right? Anyway, we thought we had the perfect combination and decided it was really kind of fun."</p> <p>"Yeah, I get it now." I said.</p> <p>"You know I can't go on like this." she said.</p> <p>"I don't either." I confessed.</p> <p>"Why?" she demanded.</p> <p>"Because I don't want to take up your time. I mean, if you're going to be honest with me..."</p> <p>"I'm not. And I don't want to put you in danger either."</p> <p>"So are you going to tell anyone who knows him?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not if I tell him." I assured her.</p> <p>"So, when you're with him, then why would it be better for me to be with him without knowing his name?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, there's no danger of that. I'm just wondering how far you'll go with him." I said, "You're a married woman who has been for a while."</p> <p>"So?" she asked.</p> <p>I pulled the bottom of my tank top over my head and tossed the top on the floor but kept the top on. She followed suit so that she could see what I had. We were both breathing heavy with excitement but all we could think about was him.</p> <p>"We're alone." I said, "And maybe we shouldn't."</p> <p>For a while we just sat there staring at each other. I reached behind me and started undoing my bra. Once it hit the floor I lifted it off my shoulders and let it fall to the floor. My small breasts stood right in front of his face and he started to eat them out as much as he could. It was a lot easier than we could have imagined. The way his cock started throbbing in the first second of his mouth started to subside as his tongue started to work around the areola. He gently sucked on my nipples and I held both of his head gently. After a few minutes I looked at her and saw that she had her eyes closed but was still watching us intently. I reached over and lifted her left over to him and let his cock slide along my lips.</p> <p>"I love you," he said to me between kisses, "And I just can't wait to be with you again."</p> <p>"So you're ok with us being together?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Oh yes. That sounds exciting." she said.</p> <p>"So we should meet him."</p> <p>"We should get together now so I can introduce you to the guy." she insisted.</p> <p>"You're serious."</p> <p>"I'm just teasing right now isn't I?" she said.</p> <p>"Yeah," I agreed, "But I'm game if it comes to that."</p> <p>"So now you want to know what we're meeting?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>"He's my son, a year younger than your son."</p> <p>"And he's a friend of mine." I said.</p> <p>I could see her smile as I said that and was just about to put a stop to it when she said, "Are you having second thoughts?" and I pulled her to me and kissed her. When we kissed I could feel the throb of his cock. In the heat of the night with all the excitement, I'm afraid that I was in danger of him exploding right thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
