I was starting to feel so self conscious about what I was doing, and for a moment, I had forgotten about it. But now, everything is really starting to feel sexy, just because it's happened," he admitted, running a hand down her cheek. She grinned, but it didn't go unnoticed.</p> <p>"So, is there anything you want to confess to?" he asked, as he drew her hands away from his crotch and slid them over to his hips.</p> <p>"I'm actually pretty open-minded on that part, Mike. I might just like your thing better..." she said, trying to sound convincing.</p> <p>The thought of her saying no was really sexy, and the feel of her hands rubbing over his stiff cock through the jeans she was wearing made their conversation turn a little more flirtatious. The kiss was only as innocent as a lot of the other day, and her fingers began to stroke his hard cock through the denim, but she seemed to be getting lost in the moment, as he felt his penis jump and respond to her.</p> <p>"So, what do ya want out of my deal?" she asked, a little breathlessly.</p> <p>"You got it, you have a deal," he said. "I mean, we're both hot, and what more could we possibly want? What we could get out of our deal if we just let us do each other? Are you willing to give it to me?"</p> <p>In a way, he was, but he wouldn't be agreeing to a deal if he was afraid of losing it. It would be more fun to play the game in a way she could like and take control, if it meant giving herself over to his touch. She smiled at that, almost shyly again.</p> <p>"All right," she responded, her eyes going slightly to the side.</p> <p>"Yes, and I think," he said as he dropped his zipper and let his cock spring out, "that sounds like a good deal to me." His voice carried the sound of approval from her lips as they both stared at his cock, still slick and semi-hard, now standing out at attention.</p> <p>She pulled her skirt off as she leaned in, pulling out her feet and stepping out of her black panty hose. As she was bending down to pull them off, Mike saw the soft, pink lips between her legs, spreading and opening. He stood up and dropped his boxers and began to take off his shirt.</p> <p>They moved closer, their bodies brushing together as she let him undo the button on her blouse and push it up her arms. She reached behind and grabbed his dick with her hand, then ran her hands over his strong chest.</p> <p>"God, you're so hard," she breathed into his ear, "so fucking hard," she said.</p> <p>"I think I'm gonna like this," he said, bending down to kiss her. He reached around and rubbed his hard cock against her crotch as they stood there in one another's arms kissing and feeling each other up. His fingers found her nipples, squeezing gently as he bent her head forward and took one in his mouth. She moaned as his mouth took some of her weight as he pressed his tongue hard into her mouth. She wrapped her arms around his neck and leaned back up against him, her legs on either side of his as she pushed him against the wall. His right leg went around her hips as she bent over and ran her hands up and down his back as his lips moved down her neck and he began to lick and suck each of her nipples. She began to pant as he began to suck on each one, then he trailed lips down to her belly and began to kiss and nibble on her belly while her legs came up around his hips and he began to rub all the way along her pussy slit until his fingers slipped along her lips and he slipped one, then two fingers inside her, pressing their way inside her. She moaned and writhed under him as he fucked her with his fingers, spreading her lips wide with his thumb and running it up and down her slit until her juices were flowing freely.</p> <p>"Oh, Mike, yesssss," she cried out as he slid his fingers in a little deeper, causing her pussy to tighten around his fingers. He began to fuck her faster, his fingers rubbing her with a quick brush against her clit with each movement, his thumb rubbing it faster and faster, and he could feel her pussy start to quiver as she pushed up and rubbed against his hand. He moved his other hand from her and placed them over the one he had in back, and her right leg fell over his, the heels of her shoe touching his legs on the other inside his. She grabbed his head and turned him on his back, her leg coming up over his hip and holding him in place as she leaned over with her mouth on his, kissing him hardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
