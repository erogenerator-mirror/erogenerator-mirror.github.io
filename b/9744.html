"It makes me want to do it again." He laughed. 'Awww.' He sounded disappointed. "I'm sure I could get off. I'd be tempted to try again after tonight."</p> <p>"No, I have to do this myself, no holds barred. I need to help you out of your clothes, and I can do this," He said, stepping in front of me. "Let's go inside. "</p> <p>The light wasn't on in the bedroom in the rest rooms, however, so I knew that we couldn't be seen with the door closed fully open. So I did myself up and led him to the stairs. I didn't have the strength to keep him from putting the key out in the hallway by taking my own. We went up the stairs to the master bedroom, and he was right in front of the door and he pushed the button for the third one. We entered the room and I was very nervous. My God, was he doing this to me? I wondered at first but the image of him wearing this outfit came as a bit of a shock to me. But there was nothing I could do to stop it, so I put out my arms and embraced him while I pulled his head down into a deep and passionate embrace. He groaned while he kissed me.</p> <p>It didn't take long before I had his hard cock deeply inside of me. He started slowly at first as I was already too eager, but soon he was going in and out more quickly, and I was really enjoying myself. The sound of him going in and out of me quickly got me hornier all the time, and I came almost right away as he started fucking me faster. He was fucking me real good, and the feel of him inside of me was almost driving me crazy right now. I couldn't believe how good it was to feel him inside me.</p> <p>I started shaking and I stopped trying to think about the idea of leaving him alone. Instead I just started moving my hips up and down. "Yesss! That's it! Oh yeah, baby. Ride me! Fuck me! Yes! Fuck me hard!" I was lost to the pleasure and was just enjoying the feel of fullness and the friction of his dick as it plunged into me.</p> <p>When he felt I was really close, he pulled out and pulled me up onto the bed on my back. I reached between us and grabbed his hard dick and started stroking it while I watched him as he got off of me. Then I moved a hand between us while I continued to jerk him off. The feeling was just as intense as the fucking was, the feeling of his hot cum shooting across my fingers while I jerked him for the same rhythm he was jacking himself.</p> <p>I had a second climax when he came for the first time too, and after that one I was so ready for it. I came on his dick hard while I squeezed hard on his balls. As he slid his cock out of me I lay there motionless for a moment while he caught his breath. Then he slowly climbed on top of me, getting on his knees on either side of me. He was still rock hard, which was saying something.</p> <p>He kissed me again on the lips and started slowly kissing his way down my body. All the time he got to feel my cock getting hard again. When he reached it he started fucking it again, and I just let him do it. He knew what to do and I told him how good he did it. When he was ready he put it in me without stopping. It wasn't as much as I had hoped, I guess.</p> <p>We didn't move after that, since we were both trying to catch our breaths and just hold each other. After a while he asked: "Is that really the way sex is supposed to be? Is that what you want to hear?" I just nodded.</p> <p>Then he stood up and said, "Well, is this the new position you like best? Is giving you a good fucking feel like you used to? Am I right?" I couldn't answer and I just felt like I couldn't even respond. He looked me deep in the eyes again and said: "Come into my arms." I followed him over to the bed and he sat down, leaning over me with his cock pressing against me. I was so happy that this was working. It felt wonderful. It felt wonderful being in his large body. And we knew how to feel every inch of each other. We didn't have to feel so secure with each other, though, just the way we liked it. Or so I thought. I don't think we will be doing it anymore.</p> <p>He moved his hips until my dick was inside of him again and he pulled up on my legs and they wrapped around him so that my dick was inside of him. He continued going in and out with me right thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
