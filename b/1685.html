He wondered how the first time they'd made love - with a strange man - he'd known the truth.</p> <p>"I've never..." she trailed off.</p> <p>He kissed her lips softly, his hand sliding towards the front of her robe, brushing her breasts and then back down her sides as he did so.</p> <p>"When?" he asked.</p> <p>"Whenever I've ever wanted. You're the only one, it's your pleasure."</p> <p>He looked into her eyes, as he always did, and kissed her lips once more.</p> <p>"You've always had me dreaming of you," he whispered in her ear. "I've fantasized about you ever since I was a teenager."</p> <p>"Me too," she smiled.</p> <p>He slid the robe off her body with a fluidity she'd never experienced before. Then he began taking her clothes off as well, one item at a time, his eyes drinking over her body from the soft curves of her breasts and the curve of her hips, her long legs, all the way down to her feet. He began to get a full erection, having nothing better to do with it. When he'd finished he looked down at her and smiled. Her breasts were soft, just enough to make any man hard. He took his hands and touched her again, his fingertips slowly tracing back and forth over her soft skin, his hands moving on the silky skin of her breasts.</p> <p>"You're so...." he moaned, "I never thought anyone would...."</p> <p>"We can try," she whispered, "you know you can't touch me everywhere..... but I want you, too."</p> <p>She stepped towards him, her arms going to his chest and she pulled him to her. The kiss was long and passionate, exploring hands and lips, hearts beating as one. When it stopped he felt her hands move to his back and start rubbing it. When he didn't stop her he moved his fingers to her front and began touching each of her lips through the cloth of her robe.</p> <p>She moaned, her mouth opening as he slid one finger into her.</p> <p>"You taste so good," he whispered in her ear, "so wet."</p> <p>"I love how you taste," she whispered, her hand reaching higher, sliding down his cheek and down one side of his jaw, back to his neck. She'd spent much of her youth in bed, her lips caressing him, her tongue lightly tracing his neck and down to his collarbone; one hand lightly rubbing at his nipple through the material of the robe.</p> <p>"I need, I need to...." he breathed, "you've always been pretty sexy." he finished as he slid his finger from her slit, which was slick with excitement, the juices of her desire all over his hand. He kissed her, and she moaned as she tasted herself on his lips. He pulled his robe completely off his body. They lay on the floor for a while, both watching each other's eyes as he undressed, she admiring his body with her eyes. The excitement was palpable.</p> <p>"I've never done..."</p> <p>"Just do it," he said, "or this has to stop."</p> <p>"Oh, you're not on the pill..." she smirked.</p> <p>His finger slid into her as he kissed her, and he moved it slowly in and out of her, feeling the moisture that made him harden, and wanting more of her.</p> <p>She pulled him on top of her, her knees up and spread wide apart. He slipped inside her without much thought, taking his time to let her get use to him. When he finally did come into her, she wrapped her legs around him, holding as much of him inside her as she could, and he just held on to her as he came on her. A few times there too, but mostly he just sat still inside her.</p> <p>Then he got up on his knees, leaning back and reaching to her for something. He moved over her and looked down. It was something he'd always wanted to do as he watched her look at him with passion. When her eyes looked at him he knew she was getting turned on again, he was so hard. They looked at each other for a moment, and then he just said, "I never thought...."</p> <p>She laughed and said, "Never mind.... now I'm curious."</p> <p>He laughed and kissed her again, pulling her legs apart and getting on top of her. He reached down and moved his finger to the pouting pussy lips of her mouth, sliding into hers as he rubbed.</p> <p>"It's been a long time," he smiled, "I'll have to keep it a surprise for you tomorrow."</p> <p>He slid insideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
