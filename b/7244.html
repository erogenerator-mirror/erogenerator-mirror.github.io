Slowly, he took me, my cunt stretching around his girth, over and over, taking me as fully as it would stretch for him inside me. I couldn't speak. My mouth was silent. It felt magnificent. My breasts were still heaving with passion as my body shuddered with delight. He made love to me for a while, his hand on my tummy, then on my breasts, my chest. He lifted me up out of my chair slightly, his cock still in me, keeping himself buried in my. I felt the wet stickiness. I'd never felt such urgency as with this man. He was holding me again, almost in the right position. He began his fucking in earnest now, his hands grasping at my shoulders and hips. Our kisses became more urgent, my face beginning to turn red where he continued to pump himself up into me with every stroke. I kissed his mouth. He sucked first my lower lip and then the other one in turn. He'd lain across me with his hands on my tummy and I'd fallen into him, he and I connected as only human beings could be.</p> <p>"So good," he groaned in my ear. "So fucking good."</p> <p>He was whispering to me. And I loved doing it to him as much as to myself. The only difference between this passionate intimacy of our minds and our lives was our awareness of the other as a person. That wasn't necessarily wrong or forbidden to us, but we could never allow ourselves our own lives to be like ours with just that knowledge.</p> <p>I felt myself suddenly go very warm within me and he immediately slowed again, taking his cock out of me. I sat there in post cum bliss, totally still as if for an endless time, his legs and body going limp on either side of me. I felt him on top of me and I lifted my head slowly to look down, to see his cock coming out of me and coming to me again. The sight of him, his expression of love and devotion, his eyes glazing with pleasure, caused me to climax again.</p> <p>He kissed my face again, the side of my face, then my lips and my chin. He was whispering to me again, loving me, "Mum, Mum!" I felt his body move, his cock once again leaving me. And as he had done, his hands rested across the front of me and began to move slowly down my body towards me, his hands sliding over the backs of my thighs again, then he came to rest on my buttocks, just shy of my pussy. I knew that he'd gone over to my thighs once again to help spread my knees. He kissed me softly. His hands slid over my buttocks. He spread my legs a bit. Then his thumb slid down my crack, the opening of my bum, then his fingers slid back up across that opening in front. I moaned a bit as he did it, I could feel his thumb pressing against, oh, my anus. Then he'd slid his finger straight into me – he'd just done the same thing to himself.</p> <p>Then he slid his cock back up my passage once more, his hips now rocking up against me. He was slowly fucking me now, moving in and out with his cock in me. He kissed me again. I kissed him, my arms around his neck as he kissed me. Then my tongue reached out, tracing his lips from the top of his throat, my chin. I felt his weight pressing me as his other hand came round to hold both of my breasts in his free hand. His face was just a foot or so from me and I'd never felt so happy. His fingers were inside me, his thumb circling against the base of my clitoris while his cock rubbed against the outside of me. He was just like a machine.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, my Baby," I moaned. He must have heard and read the words. He was doing things to me with his cock. He lifted my breast to my mouth, his lips and tongue working on them. One hand was on the back of my neck, holding me while the other was moving all round, squeezing my breasts a little. He was talking to me softly again.</p> <p>"Yes." I was whispering that. "Mum you're fucking me."</p> <p>"Yes I am."</p> <p>"Oh, God!"</p> <p>And his thrusts got faster and harder as his body got tense. Then he was moving his hands up and down my legs, up my back, and down, his fingers digging into my flesh. It was as if God had given his own body entirely to me to give me this wonderful moment. His whole body shook and he pressed me down onto—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
