"But I have a meeting I have to go to that's tomorrow."</p> <p>"Ok...how about today? It's just a matter of time until I get home," Sarah's mom replied. "I'll get my car, and be right there."</p> <p>"Ok...I'll see you on Monday," I said as I turned my car around to start walking down the street, and headed for the door.</p> <p>I felt like a little boy playing basketball.</p> <p>When I walked to my car, I leaned into the passenger side and just took a breath. My nerves were on end as I started the car out of the driveway.</p> <p>My thoughts of the weekend were quickly turning from my nervousness, to something else. And soon I felt my cheeks grow red, as I leaned down to start the car.</p> <p>The next day was Monday.</p> <p>I met Sarah's mom, who had no idea that I was going in and out of the area, just like I told her I planned to meet up with her at her house to pick her up from work.</p> <p>"Hi, John...I really am going to see Sarah tomorrow. She asked if I would mind if she came with us for the weekend."</p> <p>"Oh, she told me all about it," Sarah answered as the two started off towards her door. "I hope you are ok with this all..."</p> <p>"I'll be fine," I answered as I opened the door and helped Sarah out of the car. "I just want to see all the beautiful women that I've noticed on here lately."</p> <p>"John! Do don't make me nervous!" Sarah pleaded. "I can drive around with you all weekend...but please don't take anything at home...don't try to take you in for the weekend. Let's just grab dinner while we can and go get some food. You can pick up some ice cream in the refrigerator or you can take the truck out to a truck stop, we can go take it out for a drive. And just tell me what room you want in the house. I'll drive first."</p> <p>"That's fine," I answered, my heart starting to race.</p> <p>When we got to Sarah's house, I could tell there were several things going on, but the least I can do is make certain that she does and never ask again.</p> <p>As we got outside, Sarah looked over her shoulder and smiled. Turning to me, she smiled and said, "We're going to make you dinner so you can cook for both of us. And I want you to wear a t-shirt."</p> <p>"Yeah," I answered. "I look terrible wearing that. It's kind of a work t-shirt."</p> <p>"Let's get a bottle of wine...and some cheese and crackers," Sarah said as she grabbed a couple of our dishes out of the refrigerator. "It's been a long time since I made any type of lunch for myself...and it's not just for me...because I've been working a half life on my own..."</p> <p>"What's the big deal?" I asked as I followed her upstairs to her room.</p> <p>"Nothing really," she explained. "You can do anything you want...anything at all."</p> <p>"What do you need me to do?" I asked, pulling out the couch in her living room.</p> <p>"You can go up and sit down for a bit," she said, as she handed me the bottle of wine from the kitchen. "You've been a wonderful cook and I'm just making it for you."</p> <p>"This should be interesting," I thought to myself as I sat down on the couch. "I've been working a half life on my own."</p> <p>As I set the glass down on the coffee table, I glanced down the hallway and noticed that Sarah's room was next to mine.</p> <p>"Looks like you have company," I answered as I sat on the couch next to her.</p> <p>"My sister is coming for dinner the other day, I decided to rent a car while they're gone and I thought that it might be a good time to get someone on the road to get some of that stuff off their mind..."</p> <p>"I'm really glad to hear that...and what you're sure about is why you're doing your cooking for yourself. And you know...I really can't believe she's coming to stay the night," I said, as my heart sank at the thought. "She probably thinks it's really you that I'm taking care of."</p> <p>"Just because it's obvious that you're trying to keep me out of your life, doesn't mean you can't try," Sarah said, pulling me closer. "I was thinking of inviting you up the next morningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
