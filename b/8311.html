Kelly teased.</p> <p>"Why don't you go upstairs?"</p> <p>"No, I want to make the most of it. He is mine today. It is way too early to even think about getting dressed."</p> <p>When I opened the door I just about exploded with excitement. My best friend's brother had just fucked me! The door was almost completely dark.</p> <p>"Hey, you are a virgin! What the fuck did you do that for?" Kelly asked, almost making an example of what she was thinking.</p> <p>"Just what I did for practice," I said, trying to look innocent and innocent.</p> <p>Kelly got up from the sofa and walked towards me. She reached out and caressed my neck with her hand. It was not an overtly sexual touch. It was a light touch, but not so much that I would not be willing to do anything more than touch. Kelly looked down at my chest, as if her experience might be showing.</p> <p>She looked at me for a minute and said, "I see you're still turned on from how good he sucked on your tits earlier"</p> <p>I blushed a little. "Oh, don't be embarrassed. I enjoyed that. I really enjoyed it too. I haven't had that experience in a long time." I said, still looking down at my chest and trying to hide my erection.</p> <p>Kelly reached out with both hands and ran her fingers through my hair. "I'm going to get more used to the feel of cum inside me. It will feel better too."</p> <p>It felt great. And I liked it very, very much. Kelly gently pushed me back against the couch cushion. She leaned down and slowly let her lips close around the head of my penis. It felt so good. She was kissing down the side of my shaft with just the tip in her mouth. I let out a very soft moan. Kelly looked up and smiled.</p> <p>"Do you want to cum?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I want to. Oh, yeah!" I replied.</p> <p>Kelly reached up and cupped my balls with her delicate hands. "Are you ready?" she asked as she released my engorged dick and leaned down to softly kiss the end of it.</p> <p>"Yeah, please."</p> <p>With that we both paused and looked at each other for a few seconds. We shared a long, deep look. And with that intense gaze, we both knew that our relationship had just begun. My hand went into her hair as she lowered her mouth slowly. It was incredible. I couldn't take it any more. My body was shaking as I started to cum. And I couldn't take it anymore. It shot so far into Kelly that she had to push me back as my cum was spurting into her mouth. I looked down and saw that I had cum in her mouth. I was embarrassed as well as happy that our new relationship could finally take place.</p> <p>We both started laughing again. "We did that, too! I thought... you really liked it!"</p> <p>"Well, so did... Me!"</p> <p>Kelly just smiled and leaned over to kiss me. It was a romantic way of opening our relationship. It felt intimate and fun. And I felt that feeling with her for the first time in a long while. It almost drove me wild. I didn't want it to stop. I wanted to continue but I also had to keep the promise we had made up. And I had to do it. The next time I made love to her I didn't want it to just be a quick, passionate love making session. I wanted to start with a slow build to the moment and see what happens. I felt that I had promised that we would stay in contact and I didn't want to lose our relationship. I couldn't tell Kelly that I truly wanted to keep it, that we could be together and do this again.</p> <p>"Do you love me?" I asked as I looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"Of course. I love you. I've never felt this way about anyone in my life." We both smiled and broke out into laugh again. We hugged each other tightly. It is impossible to describe the feelings and emotions of two people when we are in this special moment together. There is no feeling more intense than that moment and we couldn't have stopped. I felt that way too and we kept kissing each others' lips, necks, back, and shoulders.</p> <p>When we were almost done kissing, Kelly broke away and looked at me and said, "There is something else I've never done," she stated, looking down at the floor.</p> <p>"What's that?" I asked innocently.</p> <p>"I have always wanted to do this." She replied, looking into my eyes.
