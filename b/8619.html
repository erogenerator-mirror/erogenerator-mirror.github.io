I said softly and leaned over and softly rubbed her cheek. I couldn't have felt better, and for the first time in my life I could have felt better about myself.</p> <p>"You're doing such a good job of keeping me company I can't even tell you how much I appreciate it." She said softly.</p> <p>I held her close, resting my head on her shoulder, enjoying the fact that she was my sister. I gently nuzzled her neck trying to soothe the pain I was feeling. She sighed happily and pulled her eyes away when she noticed my eyes were still shut.</p> <p>"Do you know why we were doing this?" she asked me. "When we were going to hang out with you were not going to spend your first day with us."</p> <p>"It was for being here with you." I said grinning. "It was more than just hanging out together."</p> <p>"We were always going to hang out with you." She said grinning. "We've been friends since sixth grade. And I remember when two of us were going to hang out together for the first time."</p> <p>"I remember." I said and squeezed her hand.</p> <p>"And we would always make sure if you were home or in bed by doing something special with your girlfriend."</p> <p>"You've known that long." I told her. "I don't want you to think I'm the only one who's crazy about you."</p> <p>She snuggled closer and smiled. "You think?"</p> <p>"Of course," I answered. "You are the only reason we were doing this."</p> <p>"I guess we could both agree with you there but you weren't even going to be with me."</p> <p>"True," I said. "But as I think about what happened last night, I can't argue with that."</p> <p>"Maybe not but I still can't believe what happened." She whispered.</p> <p>"I'm glad we made it." I told her before I gently kissed her neck.</p> <p>"Is there anything else you want to tell me?" she asked me.</p> <p>I reached over and patted her cheek and then ran my fingers down her neck, across her collar bones and over her shoulder.</p> <p>"I'm not going to make love to you." I told her. "It wouldn't be right."</p> <p>"I know!" she exclaimed. "But it's true."</p> <p>I held her tight as we both caught our breath.</p> <p>"But it's your fault." she said to me as we pulled free, staring at each other.</p> <p>"Why? Are you just a girl that's always wanted to spend a few months with you?"</p> <p>"Yes! But I didn't sleep with her!" she said. "I just wanted to kiss her. It was so easy to do. I remember. We went on holiday together a year ago. It was the only time we ever thought about having a serious affair."</p> <p>I knew what was coming so I stood waiting and she continued. "I'm sure you knew why I wanted to kiss you before we got married. You knew I was thinking about you without your being there and I didn't have to worry about you getting turned on by that."</p> <p>"I guess," I said wondering just what she meant. "But what was I thinking getting turned on by the idea of kissing my sister?" Then I smiled, and asked, "And why was I thinking about kissing you instead? What was I thinking when I was in that car while driving home from school."</p> <p>I felt the words hit me, and I felt them come out of my mouth slowly and gently. There was the soft feeling of my sister's warm body in my arms and that thought brought on a small tingling feeling just below the surface.</p> <p>"That wasn't my idea..." I said softly. "That was going to happen when we met."</p> <p>"I know," she answered and she placed her hand on my leg and felt where she had been sitting. "That was how I saw the point of the trip if you ask me. And how I was going to do it to you. I was just so happy to hear from you but I couldn't be happy I told you that I had to spend a couple seconds of time with you before I thought of you and decided to change my mind."</p> <p>"So, you're not just saying that to get me to go on a date with you." I asked. "And yet I don't care."</p> <p>"I know I'm not being too forward." She answered. "But, my heart's not full yet. So, I'd really rather kiss you before we went on a date."</p> <p>"I was hoping we could spend the day together." I told her seriouslyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
