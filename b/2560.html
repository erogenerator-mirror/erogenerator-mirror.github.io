She sighed. "You had not yet arrived. You have had all your friends but had not been to their apartments. It is almost impossible to find one here."</p> <p>"A girl's home in the middle of winter. It is winter," I said flatly. "And you were here when you left. You were in my bedroom." They paused. "What's the meaning of this? Has all this been a dream?"</p> <p>"No," she whispered. "It is just that you had not arrived." Another pause. "I did have a lot for you."</p> <p>"I was not always awake," I told her. "And now I have some and more, to be sure." I pulled off my shirt, sat on the bed and kissed her one more time. "We are in the middle of another adventure, which I hope will be memorable."</p> <p>We kissed again. I caressed her belly, gently. She sighed contentedly. Slowly and carefully, I rolled her body over so we could get a little more comfortable. Her breasts were full and lovely. I kissed them. "There's nothing to worry about with these at home," I told her. "They have always been special. You should have them with your hands."</p> <p>"Now it's really happening," she said breathily. "It's real happening. They won't let me sleep with just anybody."</p> <p>I laughed, as I reached behind her and unhooked her bra. She pushed her breasts into my hand.</p> <p>"You have so much energy to spare," I told her, as I slid the straps down and off her shoulders. I cupped these lovely mounds and squeezed. "And you are full ripe breasts. They are perfect." I sucked one of her nipples gently into my mouth.</p> <p>She sighed. "This is wonderful." I massaged them like ripe fruit. I felt her shudder.</p> <p>"Do you want to suck them?" I asked.</p> <p>She shook her head as if to say no. I felt my cock harden in response. Her lips parted. I took the erect nipple in between my lips. Slowly at first, then with more pressure, I was licking and sucking on it. We continued for an eternity, until we were moaning together as I felt her hands moving up and down on the bed. Her fingers played with my hair and she gasped into my ear as she came.</p> <p>"Did I do you good for me?" I asked her.</p> <p>"You can do me any day. Now let's get you dressed again and get you out of here," she said, her eyes sparkling.</p> <p>We quickly dressed, and I drove her over to the office. She was very happy to be there. She was also very excited to have friends in the middle of winter as we had. A friend of mine, a girl about her own age who I had a big crush on, was here with me.</p> <p>It turned out that the office manager did not live nearby and he was working another shift. He came in to ask her if she wanted any lunch or snacks. She said that she and her brother had had a good time. He took her out to his car and they drove off in the cool evening air.</p> <p>"I like these weather," she said, as she reached under the car. "It is the first time that I have been taken out to lunch all dressed up. It is like a new start. Did you enjoy? You can't imagine. It is wonderful!"</p> <p>"The evening is very interesting," I said, as we walked back to the car. She looked at my face and, as if reading my thoughts, said: "I cannot imagine. We are very lucky though. I was thinking of you the same way. A very handsome prince would have to be special."</p> <p>"I was thinking of the same thing myself," I said. "You would be a prince if you got to be with me, no matter where we are."</p> <p>We went back to my apartment and we returned to my bed with her on one side and I on the other. I pulled her to me. My cock lay along her thigh, as I pulled the skirt up, and her body responded. She put her hands on my chest to stop me.</p> <p>"This is very nice," she said. She wrapped her legs around my waist as I felt the weight of her ass. She pulled her mouth to my neck. She kissed and suckled on my neck. My hands worked their way up and down her body without being asked, caressing her ass cheeks. She began to moan with each stroke she gave me, pressing her pelvis onto mine.</p> <p>"You are a beautiful bride," I told her. "I like being with you."</p> <p>"I'm a virgin," she said, smiling.
