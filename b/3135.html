The night before, she was doing something that wasn't a normal thing; a lot of it had been very enjoyable, but she knew it was more than that. That night with Jason, it was something she had wanted as much as anyone. It had happened so naturally that it wasn't out of line. She was so glad she'd worn a condom and hadn't gone down on her brother when he came so much earlier than usual. But now, that he was actually cumming, a different kind of happy feeling had passed over her. In fact, after she had climbed the wall with him, and fucked his brains out, she hadn't been able to think of anything else. And the fact that Jason had given her that first big orgasm seemed somehow out of line. He'd been more than happy to help her out with the rest and not do with her what he'd been doing.</p> <p>Maybe, she thought as she rolled away from him, she hadn't needed to wear the condom.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>Sue, being the adventurous one, had gone into the house uninvited before dinner time so that she could be ready when Jason entered his bedroom wearing jeans. The look he gave her then was one of total surprise as he sat down beside her on the couch, putting one arm over her shoulder and leaning in to kiss her.</p> <p>"Oh." She murmured, the kiss long but gentle.</p> <p>He didn't reply. Instead, he leaned in and kissed her nose. "Why are you sitting here? Are you worried that we'll go to war tomorrow?"</p> <p>"Not exactly," Sue replied, but she wasn't going to lie. She'd been thinking of some thing she'd wanted.</p> <p>"You?" he replied. "Don't be. I'm just not that kind."</p> <p>She nodded, and then she kissed him, pulling his lips up with hers and sucking on his bottom lip, before she stood up. "Let's go to bed." She said, looking at him. "I haven't been doing anything since breakfast, so you can take your time and get to it."</p> <p>"What happened?" He asked when they reached her bedroom.</p> <p>"Nothing," she responded. "Nothing happened. We had a fight."</p> <p>"What happened?"</p> <p>She leaned in and kissed him. "I don't know."</p> <p>He kissed her back, pushing his tongue past her lips, before taking her in his arms. She reached down, stroking his cock before pulling his erection through the denim of his jeans.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she exclaimed, her hand moving up and down its length as slowly as she could. "I can't believe I actually did something like this."</p> <p>"And I'm not that kind of woman," he said as he broke the kiss. "But I didn't have enough time, and not enough time to stop you, you know."</p> <p>"I know." Sue leaned in and kissed him again. "It's because you're so good at having sex, anyway. The feel of you inside me is..."</p> <p>"It's nothing," Jason interjected, interrupting. "It's nothing. Nothing at all."</p> <p>He helped her undress her clothes, then he watched as she slipped on a pair of panties, one of his favorites in his drawer, before he stripped down himself, joining her on the bed, the covers pulled up around them. "Is this a bad time to ask?" he said as he lay with her on his side and she lay her head on his shoulder.</p> <p>"I'm not that sort of woman," she replied. "When you're getting close to your climax, you think back to one of the sexiest things I've ever done."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to get you so nervous," she said. "It's not any of that."</p> <p>"Do you want to do it again?"</p> <p>"Please?" she replied, reaching down and pulling her panties up. She pulled them up her legs and out of the way, and then lifted her leg, exposing her pussy to his eye-level look. "Okay. It doesn't have to be."</p> <p>He reached out and touched her mound, making her shiver again, before he began to kiss the inside of her thigh. She sighed lightly at his touch, enjoying his touch, making herself sigh in his arms. By this point, her whole body was in the right place, and the feeling was so erotic, so arousing to her as well that she thought it could stay that way.</p> <p>"It's about the best time to ask about our..." he began, but she interrupted him. "We're not getting up until tomorrow night, after all, and there's this whole deal we need to sort out, to try to get past the worry that if we did somethingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
