I said while getting up.</p> <p>She said, "You can get this dance... if you want..."</p> <p>I looked at her and said, "You wanna get dancing?"</p> <p>I didn't know if she was just teasing or if she was really serious. She got up and I took her out onto the dance floor for the last half hour. After about a half an hour, she gave me a sly smile and said, "You should've gotten me drunk."</p> <p>"I couldn't get you drunk enough," I said and put my finger under her chin to raise her face to mine. Our lips met in a crushing kiss that had left my own body shaking. We stood there for another few seconds, savoring the feel of our lips and breathing in each others aroma and then she stood up. Without breaking the kiss, she walked over to her purse and pulled out a bunch of bills and one set.</p> <p>"I don't have to spend half a penny of these on a cab fare, I'll have to pay on your car," she said. She handed me the money and asked me to go to her desk and change my driver's license. While I was getting a change, she grabbed my right hand and put a couple bills in my hand. With a wicked grin, she said, "I need you to do this right... now!" And she pulled out a piece of paper. I turned red because I still hadn't moved my hands.</p> <p>She said, "This is what your next payment is." As she handed me a five dollar bill, I started to get a little nervous but after a moment she took me in her eyes and said, "There's a little something extra for your trouble but it's all in good faith. You've done a great job... for the girls, at least."</p> <p>"Well, thank you," I stammered as I put the money in her hand without thinking.</p> <p>She leaned in closer and whispered, "Now that we've gotten that far; you better not say any more about this now." After we left the bar, she pushed me out into the hallway and said, "Now I have to go to my apartment and change my driver's license... I need to be sure there's no mistaking you. I'll be waiting in the office waiting for you... if you need me," she said softly and then turned and left with a knowing smile on her lips.</p> <p>I walked down the hall to my bedroom and was on the cusp of being overwhelmed... I had no idea just how far I could go. I threw on my robe and went into the bathroom. I was still getting ready to shower when my cell phone rang. I answered it and saw that she wasn't on the phone. "Hello. It's Megan, it's Tom."</p> <p>As I stepped into the shower, I could tell Megan was a little worried. "I'm so sorry that I don't know what to say," she said after me.</p> <p>I could feel her staring at me. I guess I could've held on longer if I had something to say to her. "Megan wants to know if you're feeling any better!" She started.</p> <p>I said, "I think I can do that. Is there a problem?"</p> <p>Her tone was not the least bit worried. "Nothing. I'm happy to hear that you're feeling better. Would you care to join me tomorrow and go over what happened today?" I could almost feel her smile just from her reply.</p> <p>At that, I closed the shower and started to get dressed. I hadn't had a lot of chances to shower and I decided to make breakfast for us before it was too late. Not wanting to ruin her dream, I put on my clean clothes and walked out to make my morning coffee. While mixing it, I saw Megan walking out of the bathroom. She was wearing a bathrobe. She gave a knowing smile and then smiled at me when she turned and caught me staring at her. When I finished mixing the coffee, I put it in the machine and started it all set, so as to not attract any undue attention. I grabbed my coat and headed back to the office.</p> <p>"I hope you're not going to hang around long with that boy with you," she said with a giggle. She turned to walk up the steps to her apartment and I turned at her and gave her a hug. Megan took off her robe and looked at me. "I was starting to wonder if you would want to go in to work as well," she said.</p> <p>"I'm not sure about... that, but I have to be sure now," I said, letting her know I couldn't say much. She reached over and gave me a warm hug too. "Thanks for dinner and the dance," I said.</p> <p>Megan smiled and said, "Your welcomeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
