I understand. I'm not into the bondage kind of stuff."</p> <p>He nodded, "I'd prefer it that way."</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed her. At first she was shy and unsure. But, as he continued, she felt less and less. He was becoming a very passionate lover.</p> <p>She slid around to his cock. She took him into her mouth and began to suck. His head felt as though it was moving with the movements of a small cock inside of her. She began to suck, her lips and teeth rubbing against the skin of his shaft as she moved back and forth. She could feel her body beginning to betray her as her hands began to play with his tight balls. He let out a moan of his own as she continued her work.</p> <p>She could feel the pressure building in her stomach and the first tremors of his orgasm began to build in her. She wanted to feel him explode, to taste his salty, salty, sweet sperm. But, he stopped touching her and instead went off to one side of the tub. She tried to get up, but he held her firmly in his arms. She turned and kissed his lips. Their tongues danced as lustful thoughts of him filled their minds. He kissed her harder, exploring the contours of her mouth. His hands began to explore her body and she responded accordingly by reaching to him. He rolled her over so he could access her chest. His hands cupped her breasts and traced circles around her nipples. She could feel his cock sliding between her lips as she teased him. She reached up and began to play with his nipples, but he held her down on him. He began to kiss her again. She felt his hands reach up to her breasts and begin to tease them.</p> <p>She was no longer a virgin, but as he began to caress her breasts and suck her nipples, she began to moan into his mouth. He began to kiss down her stomach towards her waiting sex. He kissed up her leg, up to her mound. She could feel his fingers enter her and rub her wet lips. He was still playing with her nipples as he kissed her thigh and began to lick her inner thighs. She felt him move up towards him and his tongue, licking her outer pussy lips. She began to moan more and began to move her hips as his tongue explored and teased her clit. Feeling him suck her clit into his mouth, the pleasure sent her over the edge. She let out a long groan into his mouth as she began to cum.</p> <p>He stopped licking her and looked at her with an evil grin. He pulled her into his arms and kissed her softly, his tongue tracing her lips. He could feel her shuddering with another orgasm. He held her as they floated on the floor of the water.</p> <p>"I... I should go," she said, realizing she needed to get up and compose herself.</p> <p>"I want to stay," he said, a grin in his eyes.</p> <p>She felt so warm and feminine. Her naked body felt so good wrapped in a warm, soft blanket. He put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her softly on her lips. She held him even closer, her head leaning on his shoulder. He felt her small breasts press against his chest, so soft and supple. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her body to his. She could feel his cock press against her ass.</p> <p>She began to kiss down his neck. She could feel his body heat as she slowly kissed it. He closed his eyes again as she began to kiss his chest. He held her body against him tightly and slowly. She could feel his cock pressing against her body. She knew she had to get back out of here and get his attention. She began to kiss up his side, her lips starting to caress his chest. She stopped and started to lower and kiss the tip of his cock. He gasped and held her still. She took his cock in her mouth and slowly licked it up and down. She took his entire cock with her mouth and sucked on it gently. She was getting him very close to the edge. He watched her as she sucked on his cock. He could feel her tongue flicking around the head and her warm lips pulling at his skin as she sucked his cock. She took his cock into her mouth and took it from her mouth. Slowly she began to rock her head back and forth. He could feel the tip of her tongue against his cock as she continued to rock her head back and forth. She looked up at him again as she continued to slowly rock her head back and forth. As he watched her, she could tell he was on the verge of exploding. He reached down with his hand and began to gently stroke her hair as she continued to rock her head backwards and forthâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
