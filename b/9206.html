A bead of sweat dripped down his forehead. He leaned slightly against the wall and he slowly ran one hand through his hair. He looked straight ahead, as if afraid he would disappear in his sleep. He didn't even notice when the hand that wasn't moving, moved his arm again, just held it in place as he drifted off, unaware of how to react to the movement.</p> <p>The sound of birds sang and she looked up, startled from her dream. The image and sight of her body came completely into her mind. There in the back of her mind was the sound of her voice and his hand. A strange thrill shot through her. She felt the warmth of his fingertips and then his skin. She felt everything that had changed between her dreams and that of others. Her breath was quickening. She found herself looking at his body and, as if from a dream, she imagined moving his hand further down.</p> <p>Was he touching her? Her eyes shifted to the bathroom vanity mirror. Her cheeks burned red and she was afraid that she would wet her lips. She closed her eyes and imagined that it was Brian's hands that were touching her. The memory of him caressing her made her tingle with desire which had disappeared in the space between her legs. She shuddered as she imagined his lips covering hers and his tongue parting her lips. It was the most erotic thing that she had ever felt in her entire life. She took a breath at her own touch. She felt her fingers sliding down over her stomach to caress her mound. She was wet and ready for him. Her fingers found their way inside her panties which were moist with her juices. Their eyes stared intently into each others as they slid their hands along their bodies over and over again, moving over their faces.</p> <p>Her finger teased her clit. She felt her pussy heat as she rubbed up and down slowly over her moist lips. She couldn't believe that she let her body betray her. She looked up to see his silhouette enter the bathroom through the mirror. She closed her eyes again, thinking that it seemed like forever but seemed like a lifetime was gone in which it didn't feel like.</p> <p>She felt his hands on her shoulders. He gently eased her backwards until she fell onto the bathroom floor. She shivered as her skirt slid around her waist and rested just above her hips. She felt his breath on her bare flesh and suddenly the scent of a man lingered. She didn't know when he had gone to bed, when she woke up and found this to be a dream. Her hands reached up to him, to take hold of his arms until she felt him tremble.</p> <p>She didn't even notice when his hands dropped to her shoulders. She heard the rustling of clothes.</p> <p>"Do you think you could handle another one of this," she thought.</p> <p>He pulled open the door to the bathroom and washes the face with the soft smooth wash clothes. She wondered what it looked like. It seemed like she had never seen anything as beautiful and as erotic before, except perhaps the images of Brian and this vision she imagined.</p> <p>"I thought I should get that. It makes me feel warm all the time," he said as he gently lifted her face to look into her eyes.</p> <p>He was holding her shoulders gently and his skin was cool against her sensitive flesh. He pressed himself against her back as he held her face in his hands and kissed her gently on the lips. Their lips met and held it for a moment before parting. She wondered if he would take her mind off her and feel that connection any longer that day, just to feel the touch again. She felt the urge to wrap her arms around his body, to hold onto him. He pressed himself against her and felt the strength of his hands move over her soft shoulders as he held her face. She felt him leaning against her. She felt as if they might go into each other's arms on it's own. She could feel his body against the backs of her own. His hand moved down over her back to her ass. Her eyes closed for a moment. He felt the heat of her cheek in his hand, and it turned her on. He felt the warmth of her body against her own. He pushed the wet cheeks of her ass apart as she felt him slide between them. He cupped her ass and pulled her body back into his even more. He pushed her hips forward as his erection slid against her skin. It felt like he was pressing her into the shower. He felt his cock pressing right into her, and the warmth of his breath in her face as she felt his hands move onto her back and slide down her sides. He moved his lips to one side of her ear and breathed into her as he kissed her earlobe. The wetness of his mouth felt like fire in her ear.</p> <p>She didn't open her eyes.
