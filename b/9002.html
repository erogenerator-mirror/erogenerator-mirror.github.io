"What's left of my old stuff and who knows what others have on?"</p> <p>"I think you're going to want to meet someone."</p> <p>"Yeah, that would be great," and I thought for just a second how nice this job was, I could have her. Maybe I could get into her pants before I went anywhere else.</p> <p>My wife was wearing a very revealing dress, one that covered little anyway. She was wearing a high-neck of pearls and was wearing a matching set of gold and rose colors. Her nipples were poking out in a big, red, hard as marbles. I could see right through the dress. She had on a sheer, light colored, black silk robe. She'd removed the robe completely and was sitting in a chair across the room. She had a smile and twinkle in her eye and her eyes told a whole story. And she had the right attitude to flatter at it. She had on a tight, low-cut dress that was showing off an impressive amount of cleavage.</p> <p>She looked to be around 50, and from the front there was nothing left to the imagination. She had blonde hair and very tan skin. She had a perfect figure, although I would certainly give her the go-ahead to put things a little more into the next phase of her sexual experience.</p> <p>She was talking to the guy at the desk, and this time I think she did the speaking. "Are you sure you want to go all in, you're not paying?" she asked him.</p> <p>The salesman was giving her what appeared to be $30 for a two hour stay. She smiled and told him, "We're very happy with the merchandise, so to speak."</p> <p>The salesman smiled and told us it was very nice. He handed her a small, plain, black wad of cash.</p> <p>"What's this?" she asked.</p> <p>The man said, "The owner says a discount for all parts is the minimum, for a two hour visit. Plus some extras like the lingerie for sure. I know it's not that much for me, but for you, it's certainly enough." She looked at him and smiled as she handed him a small envelope full of $20.</p> <p>She told him, "I think we'll both enjoy the next three hours with you; we both have our own little adventure in store for us."</p> <p>She pulled up a chair with what I would guess was the price for the room. Her dress had a little trouble keeping up. I wasn't disappointed. I was sure she was looking to get more money and could use the money. She smiled at me; her eyes went from the small purse of cash to my cock. She pulled out a $20 and said, "Here's the cash for you and our room. The deal is: $20 for one hour and $25 for two hours. Then you do nothing for a second or an hour and they'll let you in again. I am going to pay the cashier $70 for two hours and $25 for two. I'll put $20 for the room if you do anything for us."</p> <p>I said, "If that's how you want to go...?"</p> <p>"And if you don't get it, fine, we'll do it!"</p> <p>We had been to a few times for her to model. She had a very nice ass and her tits were a nice, if not a little on the small side. She was very businesslike and very professional. I felt like a little kid at Christmas.</p> <p>She just said, "Thank you, I'll check you out to make sure everything's okay. Now how about some coffee?"</p> <p>She took the bag and got us each a cup. She opened the bag and handed me her mug, and told me to get my own. I did, and was pleasantly surprised when she didn't tell me where we were going. She picked up the bag and started walking across the room. I followed. She led me off down an alley. She stopped again just outside the door and told me to get up front. Once there, she opened the back door and I stepped inside. The lights were out and the door was open, so it was very dim. I could see that it was a bed in the room. She put the bag on the hook next to a small coffee table and turned on the lights. There was a small fire in the fireplace, and there were two low-lamps on each side of the room.</p> <p>She closed the door with a soft click, and turned the lights off. She turned the room a bit and took a set of pictures on the back wall. I followed her to a small bedroom that had its own bath.</p> <p>She turned onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
