I mean I wasn't just happy because of my boyfriend and the thought of being able to see him again. I was also hoping that his idea of love was something that the two of us would be able to handle. I mean I really got an idea about him after what they told me - and now he was starting to talk in my ears as well. I was happy with that. The more it got, the more I loved it.</p> <p>I couldn't believe how much I needed my boyfriend and I couldn't wait. The last thing I needed to be was to get pregnant and be without Chris. I knew that I just needed to be with Chris as he was. My thoughts continued on how I felt about him and if I felt the same way about him. It didn't matter that he was my ex. We'd just been friends, and he still felt the same way about me. He always had a thing for me. It was obvious.</p> <p>Just as I was getting my thoughts into gear, he came out of the break room and came into my room. I smiled at him and shook my head - not because I was angry with him, but because I just wasn't happy with him. Now here he was coming to me. He was still mad at me though, so I decided to put him at ease. I took my phone and texted Chris the directions on my phone while I put my clothes on. My plan was for him to hurry home by himself, so he didn't see me going back into his bedroom. And he won't know what he's missing out on with me.</p> <p>As soon as I left the room he looked over at me and started apologizing. "What's wrong?!" I asked. "What's wrong?!? What's wrong?!" I asked again.</p> <p>"You're mad because you're not going to give me this." He said as he took the phone and started speaking some more.</p> <p>"What would I give you? Just because you're being stubborn?!?!" I asked him. "It's a girl's night in! What's wrong? Do you want someone to come over and fuck you at midnight?!? You wouldn't want them to be fucking us?!?!"</p> <p>I laughed in his face. "You're a bastard. Don't be mean to me." I said as I walked over to him. Even though I felt that I was being unfair to him, I was still flattered that he wanted me. "I really wish he'd come over. I wish he'd want to see you." I told him as I put kisses on his forehead.</p> <p>"Whoa! Calm down. Calm down, babe. There's nothing you can do. It's all your fault. If you hate me then don't think too much of yourself and if you hate me then you shouldn't fight over me with anyone!" He told me as he wrapped his arms around me and then began kissing me. I couldn't get enough of him. His kisses and hugs combined with him holding me and his hands exploring my body made me feel like my life was being turned inside out. With his dick in his hand I could feel myself getting wet. My pussy was throbbing. I knew that I wouldn't last long. I started to feel a little naughty as I started moving on his lap feeling his cock.</p> <p>"Mmmm! Fuck!" I cried out as he began pushing me back into the couch. He was a strong man. He knew how to push me right to the edge of the floor to get to the top. He was so hard and I could feel his dick pushing into me as he laid me down onto the back of the couch. He began pulling me up by my head towards him. So I leaned onto the couch so he could take me in. I looked up at him and smiled.</p> <p>It felt amazing to be in his arms. I could feel my tits touching his chest. They were so firm and perfect and I felt his dick pushing into me. We kissed for a long time. I was so relaxed and happy to be giving myself to this man. He was holding me in his arms as we kissed. I could feel myself getting wetter. My pussy was so on fire. My heart was pounding and I could feel my tits pushing up against his strong chest. It sent a thrill through my body.</p> <p>"Do you like it this way?" I asked him as we continued kissing. "Ohh. You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this." I said in his ear.</p> <p>"You think?" He asked me as he pulled my bra away from my body and started playing with my nipples. "I don't give a damn, babe. I want you." He said to me as he unbuttonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
