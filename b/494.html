"I'm afraid I have made a mistake."</p> <p>"What? You want me to do what I did with your body?"</p> <p>Somewhat reluctantly, she let go of his cock, turned her head and kissed him on the lips. They kissed deeply. For a brief moment, they both were confused by the intensity of the moment.</p> <p>She smiled, then pulled away and stood up.</p> <p>"Come over here then."</p> <p>He stood and walked over, his cock standing proud out of his stomach. She smiled, then took it into her mouth sucking slowly. His head fell back slightly as his gaze closed on her, and in response, he raised his arms into the air, hands up above his head. She smiled at him and gave a little wiggle of her hips so that his cock was in between her lips. The effect was electric. His cock slid easily and smoothly in and out between her lips. "Mmm."</p> <p>She ran her tongue softly along the underside.</p> <p>"How do you like that?" she asked.</p> <p>"I like it very, very much."</p> <p>She looked up at him. "Really?"</p> <p>He nodded, and she looked down in turn, seeing the look of intense happiness on his face. She continued her ministrations; running her tongue over the head, licking away every drop of precum which had been produced. As she became more adventurous, she also became aware of the way that he tasted on her tongue. His cock felt good in her mouth. She sucked hard on it, her cheeks flexing as she sucked it deep down her throat. When she released it, she was able to let it fall from her mouth.</p> <p>With a final, "Mmm," she kissed and sucked her way to him, where she lowered herself onto his throbbing member. He held her there; he could feel her breath on his dick. She ran her arms to his sides and began to move her hips, working him into her. He groaned softly as her hot pussy slid up and down his member, enjoying the feeling of her lips gripping it and massaging it. He felt her tits bouncing heavily under her and then felt a tight knotting on his head that he hadn't felt in ages.</p> <p>"Baby?"</p> <p>"Hmm?" she said, eyes half-closed as she continued to move her hips. "Mmm."</p> <p>Suddenly, she stiffened for a second before he felt his balls contracting. "Fuck! Yeah!" He thrust up into her, feeling his cock being squeezed between her legs. He didn't care if he came from the feel of her wet pussy on his cock. All he cared for was having his thick cock pushed into her. He let go of her tits and began thrusting up into her, his hips jerking rapidly as his cock continued to throb inside of her.</p> <p>She began a series of high-pitched cries of orgasm, "No, don't cum inside me! Don't ... I'm ... I ..." she couldn't finish her sentence and continued to move against him, her orgasm continuing to surge by her own. Her pussy clenched around his cock, but it was only the afterglow of their lovemaking and not the pressure from his own orgasm that felt good. He was not sure if he wanted to climax right as the afterglow washed over him.</p> <p>When he came inside of her, he felt her pussy contract against him even tighter. His cock jerked and throbbed powerfully between them, pushing him over the brink into climax.</p> <p>For a split second, his brain and senses were in a fog, his cock spurting out its load inside of her. He cried out in ecstasy, falling into her bed. She fell on top of him, hugging him tightly. They held each other for a long time, neither of them quite sure they wanted to move on. Neither spoke; neither said anything. Gradually, the feelings subsided.</p> <p>"That was amazing," she said. She slid down and rested her head on his chest. "I have dreamed about that moment for years, I guess."</p> <p>"Oh, baby!" he said. "That was an incredible experience."</p> <p>"Are you sure about me?" she asked. "I'd love some more of that."</p> <p>He chuckled. "Well," he said, "I'm sure."</p> <p>"Good." She leaned up and kissed him. His cock slowly returned to its flaccid state.</p> <p>"What about your husband?" he asked her.</p> <p>"He'd think he'd gone too far if I talked to him. Besides, you've got your eye on him." She laughed. "Anyway, when we did that I could feel what it was like to be with someoneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
