Mary exclaimed. "I mean, I really do not think that it is fair that all these people go along with this. They really wouldn't be here if all this was happening!"</p> <p>"But your husband is there, Mary, I thought you wanted the best for him."</p> <p>"I really, really do!" she said smiling. "He really loves being here, especially for me,"</p> <p>"So, what should I do?" he asked, "just go have a good time?"</p> <p>"But, Mary, there's so many people here who are just as upset as you!"</p> <p>"So what, it isn't really fair to all of them? But I think we all have to agree that it is our duty to let others make their choice."</p> <p>"And that is the thing here, Mary. The way we deal with things here here is that we treat it as if we are sharing an equal partnership," he said. "You are a part of these, you will be with us all the time. And it isn't easy just because so many of us are so very close."</p> <p>With that, he reached out and took hold of her hand and pulled her to her feet. She felt his lips press against hers in greeting, but they were so close, the whole room swirled with the sound of their bodies. His arms tightened around her, holding tightly to the softness of her skin. She could feel his arousal pressed up against her, and it was enough to send electric charge through her into his body where he was throbbing and pulsing against her. She put her hands upon his shoulders, and pushed her hips up slightly to him. He kissed her gently, and her body arched upwards in response to his advances, grinding herself against him as well. She could feel every rib he could reach, and she ached like a kitten to be held.</p> <p>He reached down to her ankles. He gently lifted them to his hips, and they were just a touch below his waist line, but it seemed so easy to her as he helped her step out of them. Her feet were the only thing holding her up against the cold metal. He lifted her feet to his shoulders, and lowered her so that her calves and feet were resting against his chest before lowering her lower body back down in the grass. He lifted her legs, but she was not quite under him yet.</p> <p>"Not like that," she said, "I'm a bit cold."</p> <p>"It's ok, Mary," he said as he moved around to gently take her ankles and bring her feet up to his chest. He gently laid her legs across his shoulders.</p> <p>He sat on the edge of the pond with his legs straight out in the middle. He moved one leg forward until her knee was pressing against his thigh. He reached under them, and he pulled her so that she was lying against his crotch, his erection pressing against her pussy lips. He held her in place with only his thigh, but he wanted to hold her there and not let her go.</p> <p>"Well, it looks as if we have decided to start here," he said slowly.</p> <p>"Yes!" she replied.</p> <p>"We should leave now. We still have some things to discuss before we decide."</p> <p>"I agree. You are right, this is not quite fair to everyone here, but we did enjoy ourselves a lot, I think we can forgive you guys," Mary whispered.</p> <p>"What sort of things did you enjoy?" he asked her, his excitement rising.</p> <p>"I enjoyed having sex with some of you, as well as your friends."</p> <p>"So, then, what sort of things did they enjoy?"</p> <p>"Oh, they did have fun with some of the other women that we invited back over to their cabin today for that party."</p> <p>"I see."</p> <p>"But do you have anything to say about that?" he asked, suddenly feeling angry with her. He was worried that maybe she had taken things too far. He would have to find out why this all happened.</p> <p>"No, I don't think I did that," she said. "I just thought that maybe they were just a bit too much a distance. Besides, I enjoyed having sex with some of them."</p> <p>"Yes, Mary, but I told you that I do not have anything to say about that," he answered her.</p> <p>"Oh, I see. And what are you implying about this, you are just doing it to see if you can get away with doing something else?"</p> <p>"My pleasure," she said. "But how can I be your friend?"</p> <p>"That's not really what I have in mind, Mary. I have no intention of getting around to doing you with your body, in my mind, you are just making the decisionsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
