I say playfully holding my throbbing meat while I continue to push deeper into her ass.</p> <p>Slowly I continue to push deeper and deeper into her tight rectum taking a few seconds more in. She moans as I fill her bowels with my cock. Slowly I pull it out and I push it back into her asshole. I can easily feel my pubic hair tickling her naked back. I'm completely buried inside her warm anal hole.</p> <p>"Does my ass feel good?" I ask her.</p> <p>"Mmmmmhmmm," she reply as she begins to gently jerk her ass back onto me. I can't believe what this means for our relationship...my wife is now going to be the ass slut I've been fantasizing about for years. I can't wait to see what happens nextâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
