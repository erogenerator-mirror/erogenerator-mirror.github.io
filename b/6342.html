Even if there wasn't, she would have been upset to see that there was. It was only when she was home and not in her own apartment.</p> <p>There were two things she had learned in her time, as their relationship had grown in her memory. One, women were the most important things in the world. There was always someone else and no one else for them to care about.</p> <p>There was also the second thing. She couldn't let go without knowing what it meant. She loved her husband; he was her heart. She missed being with him. She missed having him close.</p> <p>Now the question was, as they sat on the bed, did they want to be with each other? They looked at each other for a minute, then got up to get dressed. On the way out they passed a couple of the women that had passed by.</p> <p>"Well, did you find it awkward that we were married?" she asked.</p> <p>They smiled and kissed each other's cheek again. "We'll talk a little later about that, but for now, I think it's about time for coffee." He picked up his coffee and sat it on the counter.</p> <p>They exchanged a look that told each other that they knew something had to be said. They looked back out into the living room; the man didn't even notice that the girl was in the kitchen. He had just about gotten used to how she looked when she came out of the kitchen.</p> <p>It was time to say hello. "Well, good morning."</p> <p>He said hi as they sat on the couch.</p> <p>She smiled as she sat there, her face flushed. "Good morning," she said lightly, smiling broadly. "How was your day, Mr. McBride?"</p> <p>He smiled and smiled back as they shared her cup of coffee. When he sat it on the coffee table, they both held their cups, and the look on a smile on his face told her everything.</p> <p>He leaned in and took a sip of coffee. "Yes, we had a rough day today."</p> <p>"I'm glad." She had trouble taking his silence for a statement.</p> <p>"We'll get through it together won't we?" he suggested.</p> <p>"Yes," and she grinned when she saw there was almost no point.</p> <p>He sipped his coffee as the look on his face was priceless.</p> <p>"I was really worried about how it was going to go between then and now, Mr. McBride."</p> <p>She gave him a wry smile. "I'm glad you're here, and don't worry about that," she told him.</p> <p>"I was thinking," he said as he pointed towards the couch. "I was thinking maybe we would have both enjoyed it."</p> <p>She sat down on his right as she spoke. "Now, I'm just glad I wasn't the one at fault."</p> <p>She smiled and touched his arm. "I know you weren't," she said. "I'm glad you're here too."</p> <p>He leaned in and placed a kiss on her lips. She returned his motion, and within moments she knew that he was going to kiss her. She wasn't sure if he had been aware of their previous conversation, but there was definitely an underlying tension between them. She felt a rush of sexual excitement when his lips touched hers, and she felt her body go weak. It must have all been an erotic haze going on because the next moment they were making out.</p> <p>The next thing she knew, she had his shorts around his waist. It was time to go. She sat up while he got up and dressed. It was good that he was back in his own room.</p> <p>He left by the curb, without saying a word, and then he was gone.</p> <p>In the car, when she got home, she realized that he was going to do the same thing that she was going to do. She couldn't tell him who she was doing it with, so she just let him go and go. She was glad that she had told him about it. He didn't know that, and she thought she could do the same for him. That would be the most romantic thing that had ever happened to her.</p> <p>She went back into the kitchen where she found an ice cream and a bowl, and then she had a salad and some ham. It was too late, because she felt something warm and wet down there between her legs. Oh, what delight. She wondered if he was going to join her. The possibilities were endless.</p> <p>She was halfway through her last glass when her phone beeped. "Hello, your mom, can I speak with you for a moment?" the guy's voice came through on the other line.
