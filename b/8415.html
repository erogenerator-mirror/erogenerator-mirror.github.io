I replied.</p> <p>"And you've got a nice ass." He finished with as he cupped both my butt cheeks in his hands and said. "And you know, I kind of like your pussy."</p> <p>I knew he was right. I had a pretty small pussy but what a cock! He got up on his knees kneeling between my legs and put his hands on my shoulders pushing me back. I let him do it for a few minutes.</p> <p>"See you got that cock of yours!" he yelled at me.</p> <p>He quickly jumped on the bed and leaned over to kiss me.</p> <p>"Now tell me what a whore wife you are and what a slut you are!"</p> <p>"A slut!" I exclaimed in a small voice.</p> <p>"Not quite, a married whore. And a cock sucking whore at that."</p> <p>"You mean someone is a cock sucker and a dirty slut?" I asked him.</p> <p>"I'm not asking it. I'm just calling it out loud. A slut, a married whore and a filthy slut."</p> <p>"A dirty slut?" I asked him trying to laugh.</p> <p>"A dirty slut, and a dirty slut!" He insisted again.</p> <p>"Well what's a slut?" he asked me, as he kissed me again.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid, cum sucking slut!"</p> <p>"Now who's a stupid, stupid slut?" he asked me again.</p> <p>I just gave in and went with it.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid whore!" he said to me.</p> <p>"Say it! Say it!" he demanded me.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid whore!"</p> <p>"I have a stupid, stupid whore!"</p> <p>"Say it again! What is a whore?" he demanded me again.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid whore!"</p> <p>"Well say it!" he yelled at me again.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid whore!" I said again.</p> <p>"Say it!" he repeated more forcefully.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid whore!" I told him and again kissed him.</p> <p>"Say that again," he ordered me.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid whore!" I said again and again kissed him.</p> <p>"Say it again!" he demanded me again.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid whore!" I yelled at him.</p> <p>"Oh and don't think for long. I'm getting hard again if you get me hard again." He replied.</p> <p>I still couldn't believe it. "What?"</p> <p>"Now say it!" he repeated.</p> <p>"A stupid, stupid whore!" I screamed at that point.</p> <p>"Say something!" he commanded me again.</p> <p>He grabbed my nipples and began to twist them in his fingers. And when they were about to come on, he stopped.</p> <p>"No, not in front of me! It hurts me too much." I pleaded.</p> <p>"Now say something!" he shouted.</p> <p>"Okay, okay," I agreed and then said. "My nipples are so hard!"</p> <p>"Really? Well it feels good," he remarked to me.</p> <p>"It doesn't hurt," I assured him and then said, "but they are sore."</p> <p>"So do they ever get better?" He asked me.</p> <p>"Not when I wear these skimpy clothing," I told him and then said. "I'm always a bit sore. Like, it's a girl's pussy. But then all I can think about is a cock."</p> <p>"Yeah. I guess so. Now come here, get your mouth to do it." He ordered me again. He grabbed my nipples again and pulled them a little harder than before. And then let go and slapped me one time.</p> <p>"That's it! You really like that!" he said.</p> <p>"I know. I like it a lot. Can I go again?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Why not?" he was looking me in the eyes now. "You really want more than one more chance?"</p> <p>"Oh yes!" I insisted and then had to look at him for a few minutes.</p> <p>Just when I was about to say something else, he looked at his watch and told me to come back.</p> <p>"We have to go!" he said.</p> <p>"Okay."
