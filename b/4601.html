How could he live without this woman? "I want you," he said softly.</p> <p>"Hmmm, can you wait until we're somewhere else? Like this?"</p> <p>And she pulled him down on top of her again and kissed him passionately as he slid his tongue into her throat.</p> <p>It took him a half-second to answer her. "So long," he said as they kissed. He slid his hands up her body and found those hard peaks that he'd been so entranced with, and found them still wanting more. He found their lips again and she ground her cunt against his cock as he explored. He wanted to taste her until they were both ready to erupt at least one more time.</p> <p>"And you're ready for me?" he asked as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him as it happened again. "Do you want me? Is this as romantic as it sounds?</p> <p>She gave her body to him again as she raised her hips to move him between her legs. This time he slid inside her and stopped. He felt his heart racing, and she knew it was coming down to stop.</p> <p>They lay for several minutes, still connected, letting their bodies come to a peace that neither was going to come apart anytime soon. She slowly lifted her legs and felt him again, so close.</p> <p>"Don't stop," she said, breathing heavier. "You're making me feel so good...so fucking good in a way...you were amazing," she said in a whisper, moving her hands on his chest to pull him closer and close to her.</p> <p>Her hands drifted to his neck as he kissed her, and her legs wrapped around him and she could wait no longer. He pulled her hips closer to him as she kissed him and he pulled hers tightly to his. He could feel her climax as she ground her hips against him.</p> <p>"You've made me so fucking crazy and I want more," she murmured hoarsely.</p> <p>"I want that more, baby," he said as he lowered his mouth to hers as his cock slid into her.</p> <p>He drove himself deep into his little slut in a series of hard thrusts until they were both climaxing, but she was holding him back and still.</p> <p>He kissed her again as the sensations started to build in his body, and then slowly began to rise again. Then he would be back again in just a short while, she told him. And she would make sure of that as they talked about what had happened and how things would go.</p> <p>He loved this game, and it wasn't over until he could no longer control all of his reactions.</p> <p>The first time he came in her while she called for him to come. He thought that as many times as his head spun he would end up with two heads.</p> <p>And now he had not, at least not by a long shot. She had him so close. He kissed her once more as that first orgasm washed over him, and his body quivered with the emotion of losing one of his best friends, and him.</p> <p>And she smiled contentedly at that.</p> <p>She held up his head to her breast as he kissed her neck, his mouth moving from one to the other.
