"Now you need to give me my space so we can be together."</p> <p>She smiled her understanding that there would be no problems and she took a deep breath. She held the collar between her breasts and looked at the tag. She looked around and noticed that it was only her that had not heard it.</p> <p>"Hello," she said softly.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>"Hello, beautiful," Jai said as he stepped into the house one hand on his hip and the other on the floor and looked out his window into the backyard.</p> <p>Katrina was standing just inside the door and turned to look out at him. He turned to see her leaning over a kitchen counter and was looking out his window as she finished applying sultry lipstick to her cheek. She had removed her shoes and was standing in the doorway of his home dressed in a light robe and holding a fork in her right hand. She could see he was standing there waiting and he saw her eyes widen in surprise when she stepped out her front door.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I know I have said I want to do something with you, Jai, but I am still a few strokes ahead of you and I need you."</p> <p>"Oh, don't try to take me for granted. Are you sure you are ready?" he asked. He was not.</p> <p>"Of COURSE I am," she answered. She saw him nod his head and she smiled as she moved into the dining room. She set the plate that was in front of her.</p> <p>A minute passed before she came inside. She sat down at the dining room table and motioned for him to place the plate in front of her.</p> <p>"Jai, are you alright?"</p> <p>"I sure am very much ok," he said.</p> <p>"Thank you. I am about to put my plate in front of me."</p> <p>Jai looked at her. There was a light sheen of sweat that had been on her forehead since the afternoon. She was breathing hard as she looked at him. He waited to hear her answer.</p> <p>"Is something the matter?" he asked looking into her eyes.</p> <p>"No," she said.</p> <p>"I think it must be," he said and moved his glass back to him.</p> <p>She held out her hand to Jai as he watched. She was nervous. His glass had barely touched her hand before she realized he felt her hand.</p> <p>"Jai?"</p> <p>"Yes, beautiful?"</p> <p>"Let me," she answered. She stood up and walked toward him. She pushed him toward the kitchen as she said, "I am here, Jai, my hands free and on my plate."</p> <p>"My plate?" he repeated nervously.</p> <p>"Your plate, Jai," she said with a smile on her face as she leaned forward over the table.</p> <p>Jai's stomach dropped when he realized that she was about to put her fork in front for him. He moved his plate to the far side of the table and got up with his eyes cast down towards the plate. The table top was far worse than he could have imagined but he was not complaining.</p> <p>"I'm almost done," he said and looked at her with confusion. She looked at him as her fork reached the corner of her mouth.</p> <p>"Just a second," she said with a smile. She turned and walked to the cabinet again as he watched her leave. He thought she was looking at him, but he didn't turn around to face her as she walked away.</p> <p>He began his work and noticed the clock, "Damn," he said to himself as he wiped down the counters.</p> <p>Katrina walked back into the house and put her glasses on the counter. She looked around and saw him taking his plate to the sink and taking a big sip of his soda.</p> <p>"I have a couple of minutes," she said and walked toward the stairs and he followed.</p> <p>"I am sorry, sweetie, but it seems like it's going to be another hour, and I am just barely able to finish."</p> <p>"It wasn't that hard on your stomach, Jai," she said smiling up at him as she turned up the light. "But you have to finish your plate before you eat it."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said and moved toward her. He leaned his head against hers as she leaned back against him. She put her hand out and cupped his right nipple, pulling it out to meet her lips.</p> <p>"I love you," she said as she kissed him.</p> <p>"I love you, too," he replied.
