"You stay the entire time, or I tell others what you are doing, okay?"</p> <p>I nodded and he took all the cash he had and left. I started to go see him as I went out the door. I didn't want to go to the door anyway, so I took out my credit card and left it on the counter. As I opened the door to leave, it fell right to the floor, scattering the money I had left on the floor. I was completely stunned, and the look on the face of the cashier was priceless.</p> <p>She was shocked to her knees, a mixture of surprise and confusion, but as she turned around the stunned expression on her face slowly faded to confusion and embarrassment. She sat there, her legs shaking as she looked me up and down, her cheeks still wet and red from the flush on her cheeks. After a minute, she sat down hard in her chair and her hand shook, her eyes were closed and her face was a deathly pink. After a few more seconds like that, she cleared her head and stood up. She looked at me for a minute, and then looked down at her hands again trying to get some purchase for them to hold onto.</p> <p>"I'll be in the lobby," she said. "We have a deal. This is the first night ever with no pay, and then we will be done."</p> <p>She got a strange look on her face. "What?" she said. The look was like a slap in the face, and I was sure I had hit it.</p> <p>"It's an agreement," she said. She looked at me, her face a mask of horror.</p> <p>I just started to smile a little, relieved. She got a strange look on her face too, and as she got some cash, she handed it to me. I counted out the tip and thanked her. We walked out the door and I walked her to the car. I told her I'd pay her another dollar for the time the driver stayed on the road. We were home in an hour.</p> <p>I had her in our tub, and she got in first. I told her to put the towel down and I picked up the dirty towels, and cleaned her up quickly. She lay back in the tub with her eyes closed and started to drift off to sleep about twenty minutes later. I was surprised at the change in her personality. She was usually just a little wilder this time. We never did anything on the house, and after a few days, she would be a wreck, and I did things to her she didn't even think of. She kept coming home with her hands in her lap, giving me a look that said, "Just don't say you're sorry for it."</p> <p>Finally I just got out of the tub and asked her to come to bed with me, so we could go to sleep in each other's arms. I took off my shorts and laid down next to her, pulling her against me, so we could both sleep. We got our bearings back and I asked what she had said about the night before. We both laughed, and I said it was only about the sex.</p> <p>"We can't do it again," I said. When I said that, she started crying, but I said it. When she stopped crying, she started apologizing again, but even though it wasn't true, it was kind of cute. She told me how she had thought all these years she was alone, and that her friends had been going out with her friends all the time. She admitted that some of the guys had been hitting on her. If we were still like that I would not have had to make her tell people.</p> <p>I was confused. We kissed. We kissed some more. We kissed some more. We kissed some more. We just melted together in each other's arms.</p> <p>Our talk finally came to a head, about two months later, right after we did the thing. She was a little drunk, but we were good and it didn't bother her much. She just thought it was the best thing she had ever done and was going to keep seeing me as long as she could.</p> <p>I couldn't help but laugh, and ask her how she knew to do it. She told me that we had been talking on the phone a couple of weeks, that we had a plan to do it. She said it was almost a month before we could even do it, and that if we could, that maybe she and I could come over for a little bit and then I could. We were talking about whether or not it would be good to do it again, and she actually blushed a little.</p> <p>I had to laugh again too, and asked her why she had said it. She had no answer for me, so I asked.</p> <p>"I mean, it just sounded like a perfect way to start," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
