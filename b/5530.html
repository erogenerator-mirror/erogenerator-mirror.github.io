I'm glad you came over here to see who your neighbors are, that's all."</p> <p>"Thank you. Yes, I think that everyone here is nice, and I'm glad you've come and seen someone else. Do you guys like your hair?"</p> <p>"It's pretty blond. It's not easy to find someone as pretty as you," Jock said.</p> <p>"Yes, it's very beautiful. I like getting it done. You see, you've given me a great memory and I'm really looking forward to starting thinking of you as my new friend and partner."</p> <p>He smiled at her. "Well, then I guess I would really love to have you join me and your mother at the next party."</p> <p>She smiled back. "Oh yes, I'm hoping that your mother will too."</p> <p>The group went, and soon began to meet new friends. Many of them were not exactly friends with each other, and most of them were just new. Their conversations were light though.</p> <p>Jock was getting pretty friendly with a few of them, so he invited Jock and Kelli around to have some fun with. Eventually, they left them alone.</p> <p>Before long, the group began to be mingling, drinking, and dancing together. Each time he brought some friend, he would introduce himself or just say that his name and that he enjoyed his time with them. Jock had a few of his own, too, and they found something good to drink. But mostly, the dancing and drinking was held behind a closed door.</p> <p>Eventually, the bar was closing. As they started to leave, they saw that there were a few couples there. They knew who they wanted, and Jock and Kelli decided they would invite each of them to come by their house.</p> <p>They were escorted by three other couples that they knew from the party, and a young couple. They didn't know a lot of them, just a couple that had just joined them. The two young couples came toward Jock and Kelli, just about to greet their hosts when the younger couple stopped at some tables outside the door. They exchanged a brief, but friendly, handshaking and then walked toward the door.</p> <p>"Hi," Jock said as Kelli leaned in and gave him a quick hug. "You've already told me all about you and your mother."</p> <p>"We didn't know each other," Kelli said. She looked at Jock and then walked over to each couple. "That wasn't a suggestion or suggestion," she said with a smile as she reached one of the couples. "I thought a girl's first time would be with two men, after what you've just done to me."</p> <p>The two men were both smiling. "Hi, I'm Chris and this is Greg," Greg said.</p> <p>Kelli leaned in and gave them both a little hug. "Hi, I'm Kelli and this is my friend, Jock."</p> <p>When they got to Kelli, they leaned in for a real good kiss, before leaning away again. And then back again as if their hearts were about to pound. And Jock's heart started to pound.</p> <p>"Hi, Kelli," Chris said. "We thought you'd like to come and see if your mother or your friend really has a boyfriend like you do. If you don't, just say hello, and we'll let Jock and Greg know."</p> <p>"I've just never really been a real blonde girl," she said.</p> <p>"Well, you're sure not going to find out, unless you want to," Greg said. "Now, please come in and sit down."</p> <p>Kelli took her first sip of wine, then sat down with them. They looked at her, with interest and then smiled.</p> <p>After a brief pause, her eyes twinkled with amusement. "Well, I'm not going to say that I'm a very pretty girl, not that I'm a lot of fun to be with, or that I'm very sweet," she said, before taking a sip of her wine. "I just prefer having sex with guys," she said. "But, even though I would prefer it with you, it would probably be too forward for me to do anything with a guy."</p> <p>Kelli looked back at him with a look of surprise when he reached out and squeezed her hand.</p> <p>"How much do you like my hair and my breasts?" She asked, a little more brightly than she had meant.</p> <p>"I like your hair, and I really like your boobs too," Chris said.</p> <p>"Well thank you, dear," Kelli said, as she reached out and took Chris in her hand. She leaned in and gave him a very long, lingering kiss. The kiss became more urgent as she leaned back, thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
