I was sucking them hard, and she didn't care, as long as I had her attention now. Then her back arched and she gasped for air again. "Oh My God!!!" she exclaimed, "Oh God, that feels soooo good. Do it harder, baby." I did, and she took my head between her hands and urged me to take my time, knowing that I was enjoying it just as much with her body as she was with mine.</p> <p>My mouth worked its way down the side of her face to her neck and ears. I could now feel the tension and heat rising from her body as my lips teased her ears and her neck. My hands continued to work their way over her body, rubbing from her breasts to her hips, then up her sides until I moved to the hem of her skirt. I slid it up her, reveling in the sensation of her skin against my skin. Then I moved to the other side, and then back down to her thigh. By now, her hips were moving in time with my efforts, and she was moaning constantly. Finally, I pulled back, and my hands moved up to her breasts, my fingers pinching her nipples hard, as I continued to suck on her.</p> <p>She could feel herself about to come, and she moved her hands to my head, pulling me into her. "Oh yes, baby, do it," she said between breaths. She leaned her head back, and started to moan more loudly. She closed her eyes and held still as I sucked her into the back of my mouth and let the heat spread throughout her body. "Oh God, you're so delicious!" she cried out as she climaxed with my finger still rubbing circles around her clit.</p> <p>I stopped my ministrations and looked into her eyes. "God, you are so sexy, sweetheart," I said. "I can't believe that we're doing this again!" I was so turned on at this point that I almost didn't want to be left out, but I wasn't going to start just yet.</p> <p>"You need to come down on me, baby. Let me feel your hot juices in my mouth." Her mouth moved down and her long, pink tongue lapped across my shoulder and down to my chest. She kissed me there and then licked both of her hands and nipples, causing me to shiver and groan. We kissed briefly, then moved further down.</p> <p>"I need you to move, sweetheart," she said with a wicked smile. She rolled off me, and I sat up to take her in my arms. "Roll over," she demanded, and I complied, turning over onto my back. I gazed up at her from between her legs, watching them move up and down as her body moved back and forth. "You've got a beautiful body," I said, watching the way her breasts moved. I leaned in and took her left nipple into my mouth, sucking on it and rolling it around in my tongue. I moved over to the right nipple, flicking the tip with my tongue. Then I moved to the right one, my mouth sucking on both, moving from one until I was satisfied that they were good and hard. I could feel the tautness of her waist against my lower belly and felt the hard ridge around her lower belly.</p> <p>"Do you know what you would like, baby?" she asked with a smile. I knew where to start. "Roll over, sweetheart," I replied. She scooted back so she could lie on her back with her legs spread. I climbed up between her legs and slowly made my way up her body. My mouth moved from her breasts down to her stomach and then down to her hips and thighs, moving from bottom to top again. She spread her legs wider and pulled them up so she could feel the edge of the mattress as my hot mouth began to move toward each. I teased her, licking her clit several times, then moved up to her vagina, which I pushed into the air against the side of the mattress.</p> <p>"Honey..." I said between licks. "I wish I'd known this before. Let's do something special for Christmas."</p> <p>Her hips lifted to meet my mouth as I pressed myself to her. "Mmmmm... what's that?" she asked, looking back through her legs at the ceiling. "I know you'll like it," she said, smiling, "and I know we'll both get something in return, though, honey."</p> <p>I just grinned and continued to kiss her legs as I pushed my tongue in and out, rubbing it across her clit. "You taste good, honey," I added between licks. "God, you taste good." I moved my mouth back up to her mouth and kissed her again.
