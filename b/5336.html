She asked, smiling coyly as our eyes met. "Because I was hoping he would show up after you left." I grinned back at her.</p> <p>"And if I did?" She asked with a smile as she started to pull up her shirt over her head, tossing it carelessly to the floor.</p> <p>"Then it would be the dressiest thing you ever did." I said with a smile. Her eyes widened as she looked down at my bulge for a second, then she smiled, and unbuttoned her shorts and slid them down her legs. "No panties for you either," I told her, watching her face. She nodded. "I need to get into the tub first."</p> <p>We both quickly hopped into the tub and got into it, as soon as we were in, I heard some people laughing and saying some interesting things. I couldn't keep my eyes off her. "How long were you here?" I asked, noticing her looking at me with a coy smile as she leaned toward the tub. I stood behind her, my arms around her waist, and she leaned back, spreading her legs so I could start to rub her back with one hand as I slid the other up her leg. Her hand moved slightly underneath the water as the cool water hit her skin and her breath caught in her throat.</p> <p>"A little more than a half hour," she sighed. "There's more to come."</p> <p>I pulled my hands down low and she reached around back, cupping her breasts in each hand. "Your breasts look so cute when they're soft, I can't wait to take that soft body and fuck you in front of everyone."</p> <p>"Do you really think so?" She asked me, reaching down to touch herself, lifting her shirt and exposing her breasts again. "I don't mind if they do." I reached up to grab her breasts at first, but then she put both hands on my shoulders and gently squeezed, then held them up.</p> <p>"Maybe I can get you that off." I teased, reaching down to cup one breast, but she held it, squeezing again, pinching slightly. The tip of my finger was covered in her moisture as I slid the finger inside her, looking up into her eyes as I did. Then she leaned forward toward me, her mouth open against mine again, as we started to rub our chests together again.</p> <p>We spent a lot of time in the tub, playing in the water and kissing each other, as she stroked my cock through my shorts. She pulled her shirt off and tossed that in, before leaning in further and sucking my nipple into her mouth and biting down gently.</p> <p>"Oh god," I moaned as she pulled her mouth away. "Oh yes." I reached to stroke her again. She grabbed my hand and led me toward her body, sliding the middle finger of it into her cunt. She moaned as she felt my finger push it deep inside her, the sensation of her fingers in a different direction as my thumb found a small bump at the top of her thigh. "Oh god," she moaned. "Touch me." She pushed me against the side of the tub and moved down a bit, licking the head of my cock with her tongue.</p> <p>I felt my hardness pushing against the opening of her throat. She slowly took me all the way in as I ran my hand through her hair. Her tongue, soft and wet, moving over my cock, making me moan and beg her to take me all the way in. She licked her lips wet, and slowly pushed her top back in place, leaning back a bit and raising her hips just a bit. Looking up at her slightly to the side as she looked around the water was enough for her to make out the outline of my cock pressing against her stomach, a slight adjustment at the head to make it slide deeper into her. Leaning one elbow on the tub behind her head, she reached down with the other hand, cupping the bottom of her breasts with just the thin, white lace of her bra.</p> <p>"You want to play with my breasts?" She asked me, leaning forward, kissing my neck. "You want to go slow?" She asked as she pushed my head back and kissed me as her breasts came to rest against my chest. I raised my hips a bit, pushing my cock deeper into her throat, as if she could sense I had a foot on the side of her, not just the bottom but that much lower.</p> <p>I had her lean her body forward against the side of her tub, letting me do her from behind, as I reached down to put my hand on her shoulders. She moved forward a bit and I started to slide my cock in and out of her slowly. Her lips touched my thigh and I felt her tongue on just the tip of my cockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
