"That's all I could think of. Thank you."</p> <p>"It was my pleasure too, Mark. I just don't know what I'd do without you." She squeezed both of his hands into her lap, and then rested her head on his forearm.</p> <p>"I suppose that can change," he nodded sagely. "You just sit down with your legs spread, and I'll make sure I see your pussy, if you like."</p> <p>"You really do like a shaved one, don't you," she whispered, moving her head to look up for some sign she could tell that he really appreciated her words. "I know that you like my lips on yours, though. I see how red your cock is. I'm glad I shaved just a little, though." She smiled, letting her head drop again.</p> <p>"That's very nice. How far is it?" he asked, a bit concerned by her question.</p> <p>It was time for him to ask. "It's at least as far as I can go, even as far as I'd like."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>With that, she leaned forward and pulled her skirt down, then stepped into his lap. He placed his hands on her shapely thighs, and helped her move so that both men could get a good feel of her body. He leaned forward and ran his lips up to her cleft, teasing. Then he used the tip of his tongue to run up her slit, and over her clit. She was dripping wet, and he used his fingers to spread her cunt lips, then brought his fingers up to her hole. She pushed herself forward against his mouth, and he found her pussy with his middle finger, moving it in circles until she pulled it loose. Using his tongue, he brought the digit up her slit, and slowly licked and sucked at her hole. She was so hot, he felt his own cock growing stiff as his lips slid up and down her slit. He found his tongue sliding up the length of her love-button, and he felt her jerk each time it made contact. He was going to make her cum. If he teased her this long, she might lose it.</p> <p>Mark moved his mouth upward, until his lips had reached the top of her mound. Her pussy was moist and eager to be tasted as he pressed his tongue hard against her clit. She made the familiar sound of "yes" as she came, and he moved his hand away, leaving her hot, wet pussy lips to be opened and fucked. He ran his mouth and tongue up and down her slit again, making little circles with his tongue. His lips and tongue moved faster and harder, until they slipped between her lips and darted in and out of her pussy. He moved his middle finger up to her pussy, and slid it into her. He was amazed. She wanted all of him in her. She was so wet. He heard her moaning.</p> <p>"You have such a soft pussy, Mark," he murmured, moving his finger out of her, so that she could feel his finger as it began moving into her cunt. "It's so nice and warm." She moved her hips forward some more, taking his finger further into her. "It's so nice and pink. You're so horny."</p> <p>"I can't do it, Mark."</p> <p>"Please?" he said, "Please let me lick your juice off your cock. Please, yes."</p> <p>Her response was to turn and push her ass back against him. She felt his finger thrusting in and out of her, and suddenly she was cumming. She made a loud sound as she came, and her pussy clamped over all his fingers. She pulled his mouth to hers, and kissed him with all her might. He could still feel her lips pressing against his mouth, and he found himself sucking his lips as she kissed him. He had never felt a woman as happy to be with someone else. Never had he felt so desired and beautiful. He kissed down her neck, where her hair had gotten wet, and she sighed as he kissed over the smooth line of the top of her breast. She felt so beautiful and feminine.</p> <p>He couldn't say a thing about how she looked to him. But that didn't bother her, either. He wondered if there was a special attraction between him and someone else. Or, if there was just something to like about a woman with a bit of a heart between her legs. He kissed his lip, and she did the same.</p> <p>"Mark, I think there can be more than a little something," she said, looking at his face. "I saw the way you looked at me that afternoon and I wanted to do something about it."</p> <p>"You'd liked to kiss meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
