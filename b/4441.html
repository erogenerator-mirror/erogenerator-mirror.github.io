Heather had never felt an orgasm with so much pain before. As he was cumming, his legs and stomach were a little weak and he fell to the floor. He reached up and caught hold of Heather just as he shot again. He could see his legs shaking a little as they spasmed around and he had one hand still holding on to Heathers waist as he pumped his load into her pussy.</p> <p>After they had both cum, they looked at each other. They slowly opened their eyes and looked at each other's fingers still holding onto her body. Heather felt a little relief she would not have a problem getting up but at the same time, was shocked at the intensity of the feelings she just got.</p> <p>Heather looked down at his hand still holding it on her hip. He was smiling at her and she could not help but smile back. She looked over at the clock and saw it was almost 5:30. She quickly looked over to the other bedside table and noticed the vibrator sticking upright in the center of the bed. She wondered what was in it. She could just picture his cock inside her pussy and she was in for a hard ride.</p> <p>Heather looked back towards her bed, it was now about 4 and a half feet away. There were several others lying around, but there was no door on the next one so Heather looked at it. She looked back and saw he was sitting at the bed and he was talking to one of the woman who had arrived. She looked back towards a door on his part and saw that it was open and he was talking to one of the women, who was lying on her side facing him. She looked back at him.</p> <p>Heather then looked at his hand holding the vibrator still, and she saw the other woman laying on her side. Heather could also see that she sat on top of another woman and had an incredibly large cock in her hand. Heather was surprised at what she was seeing. She looked back and saw the door open again and close so there was no one in the room watching them.</p> <p>Heather then looked back towards his hand. He was looking at a man, he was sitting on the other bed, fully clothed lying on his back. Heather felt a little embarrassed and wondered what in the world he was doing here. He looked up and looked at them and then back at Heather.</p> <p>Heather saw that he was looking back and he was smiling at her. She knew that she had to let his cock out if he was going to try and fuck her while she was in bondage. Heather felt her face flush and she felt a little better.</p> <p>"That is the woman I left for you," he said. "I saw your name on the phone when you were in the other room. I hope you don't mind, but I left it behind in the bedroom, so I think, unless you were expecting more later tonight, I am going to fuck you anyway I need to. Why don't you lay down and I can get back to it."</p> <p>Heather looked at the woman on the other bed. She had a very large, long cock. It looked to be about an inch and a half thick. Heather could see a large tattoo on it. It looked like a rose in color. It was a nice, dark green color. The head of the cock looked as if it was coming out of a small girl, like a rose.</p> <p>Heather watched in a daze as he got back up on his elbow. "If you don't mind sharing the bed with her, I think you better do the same. Besides, I think she would be just as hot if she were fucking you." The man smiled at Heather and then looked at the other woman. She looked back and saw her still rubbing the huge cock up and down between her legs, she could see it clearly now. She looked back at Heather. "Come on," the man said. He turned around and then got back on his arms. "Take your clothes off and get back to bed," he said.</p> <p>Heather looked a little uncomfortable standing there naked. But she quickly pulled her sweat pants up again. She did not bother to pull her bra or cover her breasts all she could do was step up towards Heather. They both stood there in about 2 feet of air. As she looked at his big cock, he said, "Come on, now. I want you to just climb inside." He smiled at Heather. "No," Heather said. "Leave it alone. I will be along at 10:30."</p> <p>As Heather opened her door and stepped out onto her porch she saw that the other woman had already crawled back into the bed and was now lying on her back on the carpet. She looked at Heather and could tell she was looking at her tits and not his cock.
