I can't even imagine how horny you've made me."</p> <p>We had an evening before we met, so we had some time to ourselves. She took us to bed, then we went to bed.</p> <p>"We had a wonderful time," she whispered while kissing me. Her soft lips felt so good against mine. It had been a while since we had had sex, and it felt wonderful. I felt her tongue slide against mine. I could taste her pussy on both of us.</p> <p>"I can't believe how lucky I am," she said, "how hot you are, and how sexy and so soft and good."</p> <p>I just looked at her. I didn't want sex with that hot body of hers, but there it was, a look on her face that turned that. It made my dick start to grow.</p> <p>"Now we can take care of the problem."</p> <p>With my dick already rock hard, she knelt down on the edge of the bed and looked up at me.</p> <p>"If your dick's gonna grow any bigger, you have to have a little more experience."</p> <p>She reached out and took my dick in her hand. It almost seemed as if it had a mind of it's own. She ran her fingers lightly over the head and then slid them up and down. Then she took my dick in her mouth. She wasn't sucking it too fast at first, but I could tell she really liked it, and I knew she wanted to do it again.</p> <p>She went slow, and when I was almost an inch from coming, she stopped there, then she slid two of her fingers down my shaft and started to move her head up and down. After a few minutes of that, she slid a third finger down my shaft and held it steady for her as she moved her lips to the head so that she could kiss his head every so often with her warm wet lips.</p> <p>After a few minutes, she slid her mouth down onto my dick and held it with her lips, and then took it out of her mouth. She leaned back on the bed and said,</p> <p>"I can't take this. I need to fuck, so do it and let's do it."</p> <p>While I was still hard, I moved over her on the bed and pushed her knees apart to lie between them. I pushed the head of my dick against her pussy, then let my dick slide in a little farther. As I pushed into her, my body was pushed hard against hers. It's a strange feeling when you press hard against her pussy with a hard dick. But we had done it a lot of times, and soon I had the whole of my cock in her.</p> <p>We both cried out at the feeling. She held me in there while I felt her pussy tighten around me. Soon I started to fuck her in earnest, sliding my cock in and then letting it go the same way. She was so slick that my dick slipped in and out of her in long soft strokes. I don't know how long we fucked, but soon we began to kiss and caress each other. After all, we had just got home from a date, so we really felt like we were going to be fucking long, slow and dirty again.</p> <p>She got a little wild, lifting on her toes to put her arms around my neck and kiss me. I started to fuck her faster and harder, feeling my cock moving with her hips. As she was getting wilder, I picked up the pace. She responded with an equal force.</p> <p>"Do me, Paul, do me hard and deep, make me come."</p> <p>It was then I realized that she was talking to me in a very erotic way as she made that request, but it wasn't really in a sexual way at all. She wanted it hard and fast, and we were both getting the treatment. I was still driving my cock in and out of her as hard and as fast as I could, and I wondered why I hadn't done that earlier. I couldn't believe my ears. She started to moan and wail, and she was bucking against me as she got louder. Her body was getting rammed hard by my cock.</p> <p>Then the dam about to burst broke. She started to orgasm almost at the same time. I could feel her pussy grabbing and squeezing my dick as she had before.</p> <p>"Are you all right?" I asked as my own orgasm started to build.</p> <p>"Yes, Oh Yes," she moaned. "Oh yes, fill me up."</p> <p>I could feel my juices starting to flow, and it didn't bother me that I was coming to end up on top of her. She had moved her arms around me and was pulling me into her even tighter and pushing off the bed to meet me as hard as she could.
