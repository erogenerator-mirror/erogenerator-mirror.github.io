You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen." He gave me his hand and I stood again. "Besides, I really appreciate it, since you're wearing the most wonderful outfit, my dear." He wrapped his arms around me, pressing himself to me, crushing his lips against mine, his hands gently holding me to his body. "Are you sure you can let go of your inhibition today?" The words were barely out of his mouth without a reply.</p> <p>I looked up at his strong, muscular body, the way he made me feel as I stood there against his chest. I didn't want to let go. I didn't want to let go. I needed to release, to feel the power he had and to know that he felt the same for me. My hands slid down his back, gripping the satin fabric of his suit, rubbing against him, feeling the strong strength against me.</p> <p>I tilted his chin up, allowing my fingers to unbutton his shirt. As soon as the buttons were open, he unbuttoned me, sliding his arms around me. His hands went to the sides of my breasts, sliding his palms from underneath them, over my nipples. The palms on my breasts touched a wave of pleasure, and I shuddered.</p> <p>I wanted to feel his kisses there, explore me and make me want him. With his lips pressing against mine, I lifted my legs and he moved them over his lap, pushing his boxers down. We were naked, just as both needed to be. I stepped out of both our clothes, pulling him toward the bed, dropping to my knees before him, unzipping his pants and dropping them to the floor.</p> <p>"You know you're beautiful," I whispered in his ear, licking it. I wanted to feel him beneath me, against me. "And so much more." I took the head of his thick, hard cock in my hand, stroking it. He moaned and grabbed my head, pushing against me. I wrapped my lips around the head, lapping the pre-come from the hole, tasting him.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful." He kissed me before removing his boxers. I ran my tongue around the head of his cock, sucking lightly, pulling. He moaned and his back arched. He held me there with one hand, stroking my hair, as I slowly took the head in my mouth, sliding my tongue over him. His hands went to my hips, holding me to him.</p> <p>I felt him swell slightly as I sucked him, taking the head into my mouth. I cupped them, pressing them against him. I slid my hands, palms against the hard surface of his body. He groaned, and when I sucked him some more, he put both hands on my head, feeling how wet I was.</p> <p>Slowly I took most of him into my mouth. He pushed against me with his hands and I slipped my tongue over my bottom lip in small circles. I wanted to lick him. I wanted to feel him in my mouth. I loved my man. As my mouth went down faster, faster, feeling him move, pushing against me. I moved my tongue over him, taking his entire length in me. I loved the feel of his cock in my mouth. I wanted his body to want me, need me. I wanted his taste in my mouth, to feel his skin on my tongue and cheeks.</p> <p>"Mmm...." His voiced said, and I looked up at him with my eyes and felt his cock swell and throb between my lips. I pulled my mouth away, and he placed his hands at the back of my head, encouraging me.</p> <p>He pulled me forward a little until my lips touched his hardness. I opened wide, taking him into my hot mouth, massaging his shaft with my tongue, tasting him, wanting him again. I pushed him back again, but again he pulled away.</p> <p>"No...I want you right where I want you." His voice was almost a whisper, and I leaned back, my breasts pushing against him, the nipples hard in the cool air. I took him back in my hand, and licked him as I took him in my mouth again. The warmth of his body was all I want. I moved my head back and forth, feeling the length and thickness of him between my lips. His hands were resting on the outside of my thighs, pressing my pussy tightly against him. His head was back against the pillow, his eyes staring at me, his body tensed against me.</p> <p>He began to move his hips, pushing himself into me, feeling himself pushing in and out of me. His hands kept moving against me, sliding to my chest, holding me tightly to myself. He moved up again, his cock so close to my mouth, my tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
