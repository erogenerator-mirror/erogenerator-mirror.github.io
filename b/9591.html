You really make my day."</p> <p>She kissed me softly and said, "I know you can kiss and do that to my body, and that's why I've been on the couch, looking at the clock, and wishing I could go back to sleep again. Would you like to have a little fun, too?"</p> <p>I hesitated. The time was a little late, but I could feel my penis twitching. I quickly agreed, then decided to wait.</p> <p>With a sigh, I kissed Melissa's neck and nibbled her shoulder blade, then moved to her lower, rib cage, kissing her belly button, going lower, moving in a circle, over the top of her right breast. She lifted her legs, and I kissed and licked her stomach, finally reaching her navel. I kissed and licked all around it, then went lower, circling it, kissing and licking on it.</p> <p>Melissa moaned and pushed her hips into my face wanting more. So I went lower, gently flicking my tongue over and around her clitoris, and she groaned and ground her crotch against my face. Then she gasped and tensed, and climaxed for the second time tonight.</p> <p>As her climax subsided, she kissed my lips softly and said, "Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Mm-hmm," was my answer. Then I stood up. Melissa held out a hand and helped me to my feet, and we headed to the couch where we could enjoy a little more. Then I began to remove my shirt.</p> <p>Melissa smiled at me and said, "I never go this fast when getting undressed, you'll see." I undressed quickly and stood, and then Melissa, topless, pulled out the couch and sat down with knees up.</p> <p>I moved in and kissed her, and kissed her neck and worked my way up her body. She turned her head and we gave in to each other for a bit, as if to say we had a special night.</p> <p>I lay down and she crawled between my legs and I spread them for her. She took the head of my penis in her mouth and sucked hard. As she did this, she wrapped her hand around it and jacked me off with her hand, not all the way. In the dim light, she looked up at me as she pumped me to life from head to base.</p> <p>"So, what do you want to do, Mr. James?" she asked, her eyes sparkling when she said that.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you," I said seriously, and kissed her.</p> <p>She kissed me back and said, "That sounds awfully romantic to me—and more romantic to us both."</p> <p>"Mmm," I agreed. "How about an afternoon of love-making?"</p> <p>She sat up and pulled me down to her, taking my prick in both hands and stroking with long, fast strokes. My eyes rolled back into my head, and I reached down with both hands to cup and fondle her breasts. Her nipples were hard and erect, and they felt terrific in my palms. She kissed me, and I tasted my pre cum on her mouth. We moved our hands together, and she slid her hand down my body to find my cock.</p> <p>"Here I come," she said with a gasp. "And you're the first."</p> <p>She took my cock in her hand, and guided it into her wet slit, and I sank in deeply. Her head tipped back and her arms went around me, and her legs came up with mine. She fucked me for about twenty seconds, then said sharply, "Enough!" and began to moan.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, harder!" Melissa moaned as her first orgasm shot through her body with a force her body had never felt before. When I started to shoot, she said, "Not yet!" and I got a wicked grin.</p> <p>"What?" I asked hesitantly.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me now!" Melissa said, and I pulled out of her, and then went to my knees, my cock still very erect.</p> <p>"Here," she said, pulling me toward her, turning around, and sitting up quickly. "In bed."</p> <p>I walked into the bedroom and got on the bed. Then I knelt down in front of her on her knees, and leaned forward to give her pussy a nice, wet kiss. Then I lay down beside her. She reached out with both hands and grasped my cock in both her hands, and began giving me a sexy, slow, long kiss. She wrapped her arms around my neck, and said, "That's it, Mr. James.
