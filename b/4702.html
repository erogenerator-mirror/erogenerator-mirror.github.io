I was so nervous and excited.</p> <p>The first couple minutes I just had to sit at the desk and masturbate, though I couldn't.</p> <p>Once in the men's room there were a few men and a woman. There was an older guy in the corner that I had only met a few minutes ago, but he seemed to be about 30. He was well built, obviously a big tipper. He had no idea I work at the office. He gave me a look of disgust that I would probably never see again, but in a good way.</p> <p>By the fifth session I was really getting into it as I played with my now throbbing clit. I had been having these thoughts about a few men for at least the last two years but had never actually been actually with a real real man. I had always thought some real man would make my fantasies real. I tried to stop myself though and not to put on a dirty show or put my hand into my panties, but I was afraid of getting too excited. I was worried about getting any unwanted attention, so I just went right to work.</p> <p>Finally after the third minute or so of the masturbation session, I started feeling the pressure build up inside of me. When the fifth and fifth minute were up, I had to give in again. I wasn't sure what I wanted because I felt like I was just going to explode. I went to the restroom and locked the door and grabbed a warm washcloth. I wrapped it around my wet naked body. I started rubbing my throbbing clit as the water from the faucet dripped off of it. I slid my fingers down and into my wetness as I rubbed it with the washcloth. I was really in to it now. I had just given in to a need. I hadn't realized the need. I rubbed my clit and came again and then again and I felt myself start to shake. I wasn't close to getting off however. I had wanted to fuck. I felt my insides clench and then a sudden wave of something inside of me, pushing me to go over another level. It didn't feel anything like the first wave, but it sure wasn't like the first. It felt just right. It felt like my insides and inner labia were holding on to me, holding onto something inside it in the middle.</p> <p>When I started to come down from the orgasm, I thought about making it a one-time thing, just to tease myself, but I didn't want this feeling to happen anymore. It felt good to have it done by a real man and I was determined to please myself and feel it. I slid the washcloth off and felt wet and pungent as I wiped myself off.</p> <p>I finished washing the washcloth, put it on the sink and went over to the counter, but I didn't bother to bring the washcloth to my face. I turned on the shower and started to work. Within a minute I could hear the water start to run. The sound of it made my skin start to tingle and then my whole body start to tingle.</p> <p>'That's it, go on, give me a hand on the clit. Cum for me." I heard another voice say. I looked at the bathroom mirror and gave it a quick glance before pulling my hand from between my legs. I was still trying to get my emotions under control, so instead of masturbating in a stall I turned on the shower at my own stall and slid my panties down. I then put my shirt on my panties and wrapped them up in the dirty white fabric.</p> <p>I took my panties and washed them, then wrapped them in a black and purple towel just before the door opened. I almost didn't make an attempt to close the door.</p> <p>"Hello, Mrs. Thompson. Good to see you." The guy said and it was obvious that it was a nice looking guy. He had a nice tan looking skin tone, but his was obviously more hair. He wore a light blue t-shirt and I couldn't see his pants. His hair was brown and straight and his hair was neatly cut. He was dressed in a long brown skirt and a tight gray sweater. I could make out he was wearing a black leather vest and black leather pants.</p> <p>"Hello, I'm Joe, and this is Jessica." Jessica said as she gave Joe a quick hug.</p> <p>I shook Joe's hand and gave my husband a smile, "Hello, Joe. I'm not Jessica."</p> <p>"Hey, I'm Jessica, I'm sorry I didn't realize that I was your partner. Nice to see you again." He replied and he gave me a kiss on the cheek, but not as friendly as before.</p> <p>This time I feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
