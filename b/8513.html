He slipped his tongue inside her mouth and gently caressed the inside of her mouth with it, before breaking the kiss and standing.</p> <p>“Where are you going now?” She murmured.</p> <p>“I’m going to take a shower.” He said.</p> <p>A few minutes later she was standing under the shower head watching the door. A naked man with a smile on his face was leaning against the door with something in his hand. She was stunned and she started to turn around. With his back to her he closed the shower door. With his back against the door and his hands, he grabbed a bar of soap and began to lather up her body with it. As he licked his lips then he squeezed in between her legs and rubbed his hard member against the outside of her pussy.</p> <p>Her body reacted instantly and she quickly reached between him and the shower head. He quickly turned her over so that his cock was up against her ass and with her arms around his neck, she kissed him deeply, her tongue quickly searching for his throat then she let him kiss his way down her body, over her stomach to her bald patch and she took his cock in her hand and guided the tip towards her waiting and wet hole.</p> <p>She reached down, taking his hand and brought his hand to her waiting pussy and took his fingers down between her lips and rubbed her juice all over his fingers. She could feel her legs begin to quiver as she was slowly rocking herself towards orgasm. She could feel the tension in her body building and she knew that she had to have him inside her.</p> <p>“Oh God, oh God, Please." She gasped. He didn’t wait. He pulled out his fingers from between her lips and slid the head of his cock into her waiting lips, stretching her wide. She held still for a moment just feeling the throbbing head and then she let herself go, taking him one last time into her mouth, feeling the heat of his throbbing member deep in her throat.</p> <p>He took her by the shoulders gently and she turned him around to face the wall and leaned over to kiss him. Her face and her lips felt so warm and soft that she didn’t stop to think. She brought her hand and her fingertips to his shoulder and then slid it down his chest until her hand was resting on his hard cock, as he stood against the wall. There was no other word for it than hers.</p> <p>She pressed her lips against his and they began to lick and kiss each other, her hands still on his hard cock. She could feel his manhood swelling inside her and a slow but steady throbbing as he neared orgasm, just as he was about to cum. With one last thrust with his cock deep inside her as she heard him grunt and then explode into her, she came, her legs shaking as she was still sucking him with all the passion she had and holding her arms tight to his shoulders, he felt her pussy contracting in his arms which felt as though it was trying to wrap and pull him even deeper inside her.</p> <p>He finally pulled himself from her mouth as he kissed her.</p> <p>“I think he enjoyed that very much.” She said as she slid her head down to kiss him. “I think he came inside me when I came, and it was absolutely beautiful, thank you, I love you.”</p> <p>As she said this, she reached for his hands and brought them up to her breasts, and began to rub her nipples as if she were still dancing. He cupped them and then started to rub them, feeling as the blood continued to flow back into them, but her body was still quivering and she felt like some sexual animal in heat. So was she.</p> <p>He rolled her to her back and rolled over on top of her, their combined juices and sweat mingling on her back as he was on his knees now, and leaning forward, he began to kiss her belly as his hips moved slowly up and down between her spread legs, the tip of his cock coming just at the point where her wet cunt lips were. He kissed her belly over and over, working his way down until he could kiss the insides of her thighs, each one to each side of her pussy. She opened her legs to him, wanting him to get there more than she wanted any time in the whole time they were together, all while she felt—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
