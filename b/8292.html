God, I just love this. I just just need to show you that I love you and just go for it, okay, Hannah?"</p> <p>"Hannah, I'm not so sure of anything yet, but I won't be a prune in bed because I can't let you feel me up. It's just this: I know that this is going to be wonderful together. I love it from you and I know that I will be very happy, trust me. But, you can never know...you have to trust me enough to not let it happen."</p> <p>She kissed the top of my head and we lay together on the bed in our favorite position, her head next to my shoulder. "How did things go with your mom and with the two of you?"</p> <p>I thought for a moment, "Let me go on, Hannah, first things first, I think the main thing between them is that you feel the same as I do. Mom was right when she described that you love to please, to be kissed."</p> <p>I thought back on my mom's words to do better and I remembered what I had said at the barbecue the other day. "I am very lucky to be the man of your dreams. I think I like you much more now."</p> <p>She smiled at me and added, "And, I think you are in love with me. Your mom has told me so many times that you feel the same. I love you so much and don't care where we're going to take the day, because I don't care if I walk home on crutches or whatever." I looked up at her face and saw that her eyes were still sparkling brightly.</p> <p>"And, I love you just as much as you love me. I love making love to you too. It is a wonderful feeling I have never had before in my life." I reached up and stroked her cheek as we looked into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"But, I guess this isn't enough. Do you have anyone you need to get out before we have to find the car again?"</p> <p>"Well, not really, but..."</p> <p>I interrupted her thoughts. "Hannah, have you ever gone to the mall with one of your friends?</p> <p>"No, not really. But, I like to look good. Have you? I mean, you look really great in your little dress; that looks great on you. Do you have any friends that you would like to spend time with?"</p> <p>"No, nothing like that. My friends are mostly just good friends. They are not going to be very happy when I get old."</p> <p>"Well, I am going to have to get you something to wear tonight and if your friend looks good in it, why don't you take a look in a shop?"</p> <p>"I think that's probably about it."</p> <p>"I think it's time that you got out of those dress. I know you're not going to be able to stand up for yourself dressed like that."</p> <p>"Well, it's not about this."</p> <p>"What? Why not?" I was thinking of a song to tell her that I would rather go out of my way not to have that kind of effect on her.</p> <p>"You said you wanted to go on a date, Hannah. You're not making that up. You made that up for the time we were both gone to college."</p> <p>"But, why don't we just go dancing or something?"</p> <p>"No. But you'd better get out of those clothes. That's all."</p> <p>"There are no choices with this. I just need to wear something to keep you from wanting to go to the next restaurant. I am going to have to walk in the mall for a bit, but as soon as I get there, I'm taking those shoes off." She was really getting excited and I had no doubts that I was going to see her in the short time that we were here.</p> <p>"I'll go with you and let you choose," I said as we packed our bags around me.</p> <p>She gave me a warm smile and kissed my ear as she packed. "Hannah, I wouldn't do that. Don't you remember? I just want you to get comfortable."</p> <p>"That's okay, Hannah. I just want you to remember that it's not that. It's that you can start all over, no one will ever be that way to you if you try to be a little more adventurous. I just don't like to be the one to take your clothes off, especially not in this place."</p> <p>With that comment, my mom started doing some more walking in front of the boutique and I found myself becoming aware about the weight of what I was feeling asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
