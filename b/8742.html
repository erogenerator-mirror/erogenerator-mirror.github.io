"I think he's upset." she said to the group of four. "What's going on?"</p> <p>"We'll get to that in a while." said Matt as he came over and started to put the plates on the table. After he finished the plate, he reached down to adjust his pants.</p> <p>"Why don't you just stay awhile Matt? I'm sure he wants to make you happy."</p> <p>"No, I think he's afraid to leave me."</p> <p>The rest of the team quickly turned and started the drive in silence.</p> <p>It was getting dark. Everyone was in the bathroom when Jen came out. She couldn't help but notice the other girls were looking at her. She wondered if she still had any underwear on.</p> <p>"What's going on with you guys?" she asked suddenly.</p> <p>Everybody in the room just stared at her.</p> <p>Jen couldn't believe what she just did. She had never had sex before. Her friend had seduced her that night. She had enjoyed it! She had loved it but now felt awkward. She wondered what it had felt like as well.</p> <p>She suddenly felt nervous as Matt walked towards her.</p> <p>"Are you ok?" he asked.</p> <p>"You know you can't do that."</p> <p>"No I don't. Look, I'll tell you what happened in the office. I'm sorry I lied to you earlier."</p> <p>"You can't say that Matt." Jen said as she turned to look at him. "Just go away."</p> <p>"Hey, Jen, I'm not saying that's what happened. I swear I didn't mean anything. I really enjoyed it."</p> <p>"It was fun."</p> <p>"You did say that but you said it for myself. I'm not telling you again. I can't believe how stupid I can be."</p> <p>Jen began to feel uncomfortable. "I understand Matt. I think you just need to get a grip."</p> <p>"Fine. Go away."</p> <p>Jen began to walk towards her car which was parked on the other side of the building.</p> <p>"I'm going to my car. Be here in fifteen minutes from now."</p> <p>That's all Jen had with no rest for her. Jen and Mark decided to make the decision in the morning. There were few things on her mind tonight that bothered her anymore.</p> <p>She walked back into her apartment to the front door. She went into her living room and made the coffee she had already made. She heard Matt outside of his back bedroom. He was getting dressed when she came out from the living room.</p> <p>"You're up early?" he asked as he finished his first cup of coffee.</p> <p>"Yes, and I'm so excited about tonight."</p> <p>With that she walked into his bedroom.</p> <p>"Wow, you had sex right in front of me!"</p> <p>"I didn't want to, " Jen said nervously. " I was doing it while you were talking to your friend."</p> <p>"Oh right. I didn't mean to embarrass you by doing it in front of you."</p> <p>He turned and looked deeply into her eyes before he walked passed her to turn around.</p> <p>"No, no you didn't. It was fun...I just wanted to make sure you knew what was going on around here." he said as he began to walk back towards the bedroom.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Oh yes. I wasn't going to lie about that. I'm so nervous about this. I just don't do it."</p> <p>Mark had sat down while making his coffee. He was trying to keep his nervousness from showing as best as he could.</p> <p>He suddenly reached into his side of the room and turned off his light.</p> <p>"Just come in Matt, ok? I promise I won't make you uncomfortable."</p> <p>"Alright. Come on in."</p> <p>With him in the doorway she slowly looked him up and down.</p> <p>"What about you?" she asked as she reached out to touch the side of his face.</p> <p>"Oh. It's alright. It's just a little weird with you."</p> <p>Jen moved her hand to his right cheek and stopped.</p> <p>"Just a little strange. I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable."</p> <p>"It's fine. You just have to watch what you do when I'm around. Go away."</p> <p>He just smiled back at her and turned around to face her. He leaned forward so she could see his face.</p> <p>"It will be ok. It will actually be ok. I'm just afraid that if things go wrong he'll hurt you if I don't do what I want to doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
