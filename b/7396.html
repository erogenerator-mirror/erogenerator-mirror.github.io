I asked, "I-I just."</p> <p>"I thought we were both going to say something," he said. "I guess that is why I asked you here. My name is Richard."</p> <p>"And yours?" I asked, reaching out and placing a hand on his bare shoulder.</p> <p>He glanced over at the door as though looking for some hint of why he was there, and I saw him grin and giggle. He turned back to me and continued, "My name and yours are Samantha."</p> <p>"I don't know who you're talking to Sam, or you, but I'm surprised it took you until yesterday," I said.</p> <p>"I'm not your type," he replied. "I'm Sam, Samantha."</p> <p>"Well, I thought I told you to leave me alone if you tried to do anything to me," I said. "Please don't call me Samantha or any of your family names, because what would you call me."</p> <p>Instead he looked at me with his eyes twinkling. "It doesn't have to be this way," he chuckled, then added, "you can have any girl in the neighborhood. You can have everything you want and all your friends have it," and with that he turned and walked out of our house.</p> <p>I followed him, still shaking from my own realization that he knew who I was. I started to say to him again, but he held up his hand.</p> <p>"Look," he said. "It isn't all bad, but it might not be what you think."</p> <p>I turned back to look at him. "Look," he whispered. "You have to promise me. If you have to stop having friends, go with them, because I don't care and you will still love me when you finish university. I don't want anything you might have been with because of me."</p> <p>I stared at him. I couldn't believe what he just said. I turned back to the front door and ran into our house. Once outside, I wrapped my arms around myself as though I wasn't still shaking from my own rejection. Then I closed my eyes and let out a heavy sigh. I looked down at my hands that were still trembling from my own tears. "That wasn't nice," I cried. "I should have said something."</p> <p>I opened and closed my eyes, feeling a bit better as the tears that had built and were now drying on my cheeks. I knew I should try and get out of here, but what could I do? Besides, I could feel my body starting to shake again, so I took the chance to walk over to the couch and throw my arms around myself. I could feel my hands trembling a little, and then I felt weak with excitement that I could finally feel my body finally responding to Jack.</p> <p>I started crying again as I walked over to him. His arms went around me and his hand went to my waist. He held me for a long while, feeling me tremble. Then he let his hands slide off me and I collapsed onto the couch next to him. He let one of his hands slip from my waist as we stared at each other and smiled. In a few moments, I started to say something, but couldn't seem to say much. He broke the silence, and started to caress my face.</p> <p>"Why did you tell me that?" he said.</p> <p>"Because you asked me to and I did." I said with a smile.</p> <p>"That wasn't good enough for me," he replied.</p> <p>"Then we might just have to wait our turn to tell each other what the next twenty-three hours might bring..."</p> <p>"Is that what you were saying?" he asked. He paused for a moment, and then said, "Yes." The look on his face was priceless. He turned and ran out of the house, slamming the front door on its hinges before he got to the gate that led back into the neighborhood. I stood there in the darkness as tears streamed down my face. It wasn't until I heard him and felt his hand pressing gently against mine that I realized he was pulling me out the door. I started to shout something but was cut short by his strong arms carrying me onto our back porch, and then we dropped me down into the passenger seat. He put his lips to my ear and gently said, "I didn't ask you to be my friend. I asked you to leave me alone, because you had every right to be here right now." He had lowered his voice, and I could hear the anger in it now. "I could have said anything as my friend. I still would have said no, but here I was saying yes. There is a price to pay, I'm sure." We reached his house, and he shut the door, then pulled me to him and kissed me.</p> <p>"Youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
