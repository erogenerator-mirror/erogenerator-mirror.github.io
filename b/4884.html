He's not going to let that happen if you can keep him," he whispered.</p> <p>"Are you OK? Are you in pain?" he asked cautiously.</p> <p>Her heart almost stopped. "No," she said finally.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said as he tried to reach out and touch her. "That was unexpected."</p> <p>She sighed and leaned against his shoulder, pressing herself against him with a contented smile.</p> <p>"No, it's no," he said, his smile never fading. "I'm not hurting you or hurting you."</p> <p>She looked over his shoulders at his hands. The way they had been touching her, she doubted that he was going to let her loose so soon. She had known they would, they would make love soon, and she was ready.</p> <p>"You aren't hurt," he said, looking back to her. "You need this to keep going."</p> <p>She nodded and smiled a shy smile. She was about to ask for and deserve what he had to offer, but before she could get the words out, he kissed the top of her crown, sending an electric shock straight to her body. It sent a jolt to her head and went straight up to her brain. She moaned. He had kissed her, but then suddenly she had been kissing him back. Her lips were on fire. He was gentle, but his lips were demanding. They were gentle but firm, and when he found a way to kiss her, her passion ignited and she couldn't stay in that position.</p> <p>She pulled her lips away from his lips. She didn't want to be kissed. She knew she would make him regret it if she let him kiss her. She wanted to feel his kiss.</p> <p>He let her look at him for a few seconds. A smile crossed his face at her reaction. "Don't try to convince me," he said softly. "Just come in and join me."</p> <p>"I'm not sure," she said, her voice trailing off.</p> <p>"I believe this is all your choice is that," he said, his voice deep and melodious. His hands were wrapped gently around her body and he was softly stroking her skin. She closed her eyes and shivered as she felt him press against her. Her eyes fluttered open and she looked at him. For a moment, the image of their lovemaking filled her mind, then she watched him press his lips to hers.</p> <p>Their kiss quickly grew passionate, and it spurred her to want more. He pulled away and looked deeply into her eyes. "You are beautiful," he whispered.</p> <p>It took her a few moments to regain her breath after her kiss. She knew she shouldn't, and she wanted nothing more than to feel him inside her.</p> <p>She smiled at the memory of how sexy she felt against her. She hadn't believed she could feel him so close to her, but somehow this image was making her want to have him again. She knew he wanted it as much as she did. She looked at her hands and saw that he had already taken off his pants and he had his shirt off. She didn't care how beautiful he was, she just ached to see him.</p> <p>It took a little doing for her to get herself together again so she could join with him. She was aware of the wetness between her legs as she watched him strip as he stood over her. She didn't care as she saw his large, fully aroused cock spring out from the darkness. He was not as long as Aaron, but he was thicker, and his skin was darker, almost black. He reached down with one hand, taking hold of the base of his cock and brought it to her lips. "I've always wanted to do this," he said.</p> <p>Her mouth watered at his words. He couldn't be serious, but she didn't care. She loved the way he looked. She loved the way he looked at her, the way he kissed her.</p> <p>She kissed the tip of his cock gently, her lips brushing with the small touch of her tongue. She opened her mouth and tasted him as his skin met her tongue. Then she felt it slowly moving against her tongue, his warm blood running down her throat. She felt the soft lips of her mouth caressing his shaft, her own tongue caressing him as her body ached for more. It was almost too much, she realized, and her hips shifted of their own volition.</p> <p>He pulled her close to him, his body leaning back in his chair as he put his hands on the back of her head. "I've wanted to do this for a while," he whispered. "You were just right."</p> <p>She could feel him flex as his thighs flexed under her, his fingers grasping her hair and guiding her mouth onto him.
