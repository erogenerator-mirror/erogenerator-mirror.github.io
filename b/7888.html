I followed her into the bathroom, where she started to unbutton her dress. I admired her bare shoulders as she lowered the straps off her perfect tits. She looked like she could pass for a twenty-three year old girl. In my opinion, there's no better way to make a lady than to watch her naked body, I thought. Her breasts were small, but there was a lot of padding that showed off them. She turned and faced me, giving me an unimpeded peek of her ass. It really was a perfect set of cheeks. I was sure I'd never see it covered up and probably wouldn't until I got to fuck it with my tongue.</p> <p>"Are you wearing something under your dress?" she asked rhetorically. I smiled down and nodded my head.</p> <p>"I thought so... I'm in your house," I answered. She smiled at me.</p> <p>"Really?" she asked rhetorically. "I'm here with the house!" She had a bit of a pout on her lips, which I took to mean, "I feel bad." She paused a moment.</p> <p>"Do you know my house is right across the street but close to the airport? We drive by it often," she asked in her sexy voice. I raised my eyebrows at her, waiting for my reaction. Her expression changed as she studied me for what seemed like a long time. I noticed her look had a curious and quizzical way to it. She continued by smiling and looking at me. It was a small nod of my head.</p> <p>"Good, it's just right where it is," she told me, "Now do you want to see this dress on?" I didn't think I'd last more than 25 minutes or so, but it wasn't like it was over my back. The dress was a dark maroon, with one of those little blue buttons in the back. I'm sure she thought I looked sexy as hell and maybe, just maybe, I was too! But then I thought about how good I felt that night because I'd made sure her mother was still up at the house... but now I was worried for her safety because it's that she was with me instead of her mother that night and I wasn't safe. I shook my head.</p> <p>"Fine," I whispered and sat down on her sofa.</p> <p>"It's okay to just look, Michael," she said quietly. I sat on the carpet in front of her and she was looking at me with big eyes, but I could tell she was trying to figure it out. "You look really great tonight," she told me quietly. I felt a bit uncomfortable just talking about it, but I didn't say anything to ease her fear. But then I realized she'd always assumed that I was just looking at her, but now she just looked down. I had seen the same fear and confusion often happen to her in her relationships and I guess that made up for it.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" she asked, but in a soft, almost loving voice. Her eyes were pleading. I couldn't tell just by looking at her eyes that I was in control. She took it all in stride and she was doing a very nice job of it. She was looking at me with her hands clasped together as if begging a lot.</p> <p>"It seems I can see you very well right now, you're right here," I said as I reached up and placed both my hands on her shoulders. I leaned in close and asked her to turn her back to me. My hands slid down her arms until I came to rest on her bare breasts. "Mmm," she softly moaned in frustration. My hands lifted her T-shirt up over her small tits and off her body. I looked her over for several seconds, checking to see how she was reacting to my touching my body. She was still in a state of disbelief, but she knew she couldn't refuse me anything.</p> <p>I reached around and undid the zipper on her skirt. I pulled the zipper down and then pulled the skirt down as slowly as I could. She stepped out of it and it clung wetly against her body, which was even sexier than I had pictured it to be, but to be honest, I was just admiring her in the same way it had made me. I had imagined that I could take in the beauty of her, especially the way her skin looked like it did when she was aroused, but I didn't know just why I was looking at her in that way; it would've been like my attraction of her was going to cause me harm. But now I knew just how wrong it was.</p> <p>"Would you like to see my hair?" I asked as I turned her on the sofa and lifted her legs to sit them up. Her legs were still shaking in protest and I was glad to haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
