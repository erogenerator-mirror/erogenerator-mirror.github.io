I muttered to myself in an attempt to calm myself.</p> <p>"Why do you think I brought this up, Greg? I told you I loved you. What did you expect me to do?" She was sitting back resting against the headboard of the bed. Her fingers were on her lap and her voice still had its soft tone.</p> <p>"You should... you should have..." I said to myself.</p> <p>"Get a hold on yourself, John," she chuckled and began to undo the knot in the belt of my shirt. "It's obvious. You had the foresight to bring up this discussion with me this morning."</p> <p>"So much for... so little...," I choked out as all the emotion that I had felt from the previous days returned to my eyes.</p> <p>"It's not much for an innocent conversation, John," she chuckled, "that you're concerned with my motives." She pulled my shirt away from me and pulled it off over my head as I stood there feeling every inch of his exposed flesh that I had yet to face.</p> <p>I took a step back from her after pulling the towel from the floor with the towel still in place. Taking a deep breath, I stepped forward and she quickly wrapped a long piece of her robe around my shoulders before standing up and placing the knot behind my neck.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry, John," she murmured in between kisses as she put a finger to my lips. "I don't want... to... ruin our chance to spend time together. I have to think about your relationship back home." Her body language made it clear that she didn't want a repeat of last night.</p> <p>"I... I... I don't need to think about it," I finally answered, putting on some semblance of gentleness and a smile.</p> <p>The thought of what this was about brought back a feeling of uneasiness over the previous day. I felt like I had lost my best man, as a result of what had happened so suddenly. I don't know if she felt the same way.</p> <p>"It's not like us," I said weakly, "it's still like us, you know."</p> <p>"I know, John," she sighed, "I know." As she kissed the tip of my nose, she moved back to sit upon the bed. I followed behind her as she put her arm around my waist.</p> <p>"Maybe if you were honest and committed to me a little longer, you could forgive me," she whispered to me. I nodded in the affirmative, feeling her hand slide down my chest and across the bulge that had formed in my pants.</p> <p>"If you really can forgive me, you can spend the rest of the day and evening with me," she promised in a serious tone. "And if I don't feel like doing this, then I'm willing to sleep with you tomorrow night. You are the love of my heart and I know I'll always love this man from now on."</p> <p>"Oh, I'll be so thankful," I laughed, "But you haven't said a word. I haven't said a word in... all week."</p> <p>"Good," she chuckled, "because I did say that. I don't know. I haven't said a single word. I didn't mean... I mean.." She smiled again and placed a kiss upon my forehead and kissed the top of my head when she spoke.</p> <p>"John, do you still want to go to that hotel with us tonight?" I asked, surprised.</p> <p>"Of course I do," she replied, "I had a good time with you last night, and I really want to do it again." I couldn't help taking a moment to take in her appearance: her long, curly hair covered in a slight down past her shoulders. She had made her way through the halls, her legs slightly parted as she walked and her body looking inviting.</p> <p>"Do you still want me to take you shopping tomorrow?" I asked, hoping for more convincing.</p> <p>"No," she answered. "It's your decision, John. It's been far too long, and I love you." I smiled and took her hand. "Come on, let's go."</p> <p>"Let's go to this hotel?" I joked, wondering if I would get a repeat of last night.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered after a minute or so of thought. "You go with me."</p> <p>"Sure," I laughed, "Let's go."</p> <p>As we climbed the stairs, I couldn't help the way I felt when I saw the beautiful woman standing on the porch. I knew from the look on her face that she felt the same way. I could not help but feel an unfamiliar longing to go the same way with this beautiful young lady again.</p> <p>Entering the large suiteâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
