I don't think she is a natural blond. They're from an Irish village, I take it."</p> <p>"I like blond hair. But I think she might be the one. The two of us can run a little better. And I'd love a taste of what you have to offer."</p> <p>Pete grinned again, "Well let's be on our way. It's late. We can go back to mine tomorrow afternoon. I think they'll be back by then."</p> <p>Jenny grinned back, "I want to go again tomorrow after work. But we don't have anything else planned for tomorrow."</p> <p>That afternoon was not so simple. Pete found some of her hair and some of his friend's locks hanging on a strand that he had picked up at the nail store. He had a full, long-sleeved white shirt on that he was very careful to wear. He had no bra under it, but there was one that fit him tightly. On this day he had no more than a pair of khaki short-shorts on under it. As he went into the office he tried the bathroom door. There was no lock. Pete knew that there wasn't one in back with him. It was a small, neat, neat kitchenette; there were just two people working there. He went into the bedroom to change and got dressed. He got two large glasses of ice water and drank them in one go. He didn't really want to be around a bunch of women who wanted to gossip so he thought that there was something important to do. But, at that moment there was an attractive woman with two of him that was also a woman. Both had short, ash blonde hair. Both were slightly built and both had good looking and friendly smiles on their faces; Pete couldn't tell who they were except for what they smiled at him and their breasts pressed against his arm. So, they were both nice people.</p> <p>The girls were a lot like Jenny and Pete in that they both had similar hairstyles and clothes. They also had very healthy, healthy, and attractive smiles on their faces and expressions. The only similarity was that if they were both nude they were the same. Although, both of them had only the one hair, they also had long blonde hair. Pete didn't think most of the other women at the party were blond.</p> <p>He walked into the office and got a glass of ice water. He took a sip and held it out for both of them to drink. "Okay, girls. What's going on?"</p> <p>They both smiled. "We are going to go to her house. There are a few things we need to take care of together before we leave home this summer."</p> <p>He was right that things were going to be good for Pete. Things were going to be good for Jenny and his friend Pete. He didn't like it when other people were looking at him. And, he didn't know exactly when the other night that he and Jenny had spent on their deck was the first time he had gone for a while. The more he tried to forget it the more he remembered how her hair had been hanging around her waist. He remembered how she had been naked.</p> <p>"So. Well we should go."</p> <p>"Okay," said Jenny. "We go tomorrow night. It's not much, but it will be okay."</p> <p>Pete smiled broadly, "Okay."</p> <p>The two of them got dressed and went to see Jenny's house. They both entered the backyard where, just as planned, the pool was beginning to fill. Both of them felt that they had better take the other one in. Jenny looked very nice, but there was something else that was different.</p> <p>"Do you know about the other one?"</p> <p>Mandy smiled at both the girls and started to go into the swimming hole. She stopped and turned around, "Yes, I know about your two friends."</p> <p>"Do you also like my friend?" the other girl asked.</p> <p>"We are friends." replied Jenny.</p> <p>Mandy turned around and said, "Mandy! Is that your husband, Pete? I don't think we need to see you in the nude."</p> <p>Mandy looked down and said, "But, he's coming around the other day. I might have to come with him. And, if we get caught in the pool, he'll think he's out of the country. I'm not sure I want to be in the other house."</p> <p>"I know. Look, Jenny and I are going for a swim. Is there anything that you want to talk about?"</p> <p>This time, as Mandy's face turned a little red, she looked at Pete and asked, "Is it going to be all right with Pete if I see him naked?"</p> <p>"Of course it is," replied Pete.</p> <p>"It's notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
