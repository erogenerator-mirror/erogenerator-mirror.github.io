I told him.</p> <p>He smiled at me and reached his hand out to give me a hug. It seemed like an eternity, but eventually I pulled away, realizing I was shaking. I stood there motionless with my hands over my face. "I want to tell you more about my family, but I don't think I have the time." I decided to cut his sentence short, so I took a deep breath and finished, "Well, it's been quite awhile since my last visit. I'll take it from here. I am looking forward to talking to you about this. How about dinner Monday night? I know you'll love it, but I just got some things that were on my mind." He gave me a soft kiss on the lips and said, "I'll pick you up from your car around six, but we can get some dinner somewhere after that. I was planning to get some more wine, but tonight was supposed to be for you." He gave me another kiss and said, "I'll see you Monday."</p> <p>I watched him walk away and couldn't help but smile. 'Oh, she does look stunning at night' I thought, 'And I can't wait to hear about it again. I couldn't wait to get in her car or get to bed.'</p> <p>I got to the restaurant the following Monday at seven sharp! And to say I was exhausted at five would be a great understatement. I had a nice dinner, a quiet evening dancing after dinner and a good night sleep after a particularly exciting day. By the following morning I was feeling a little better and ready for the next adventure.</p> <p>He dropped me off at six, but I kept my eyes closed and gave him his good morning kiss several times. By the time I got into my car I still hadn't closed my eyes and by chance it was still dark when I arrived. The restaurant was on the other side of town and as I sat next to an attractive woman, she looked up, startled, then smiled and said, "Morning. I'm so glad you're here today."</p> <p>I just smiled back and let the opportunity pass me by. My mind was reeling from what seemed like days of being away from my family for a couple of hours, but had just been a few minutes since I had made my appearance a week ago. She took off her coat and casually took it off. I watched her for a moment, wondering just what made her look so sexy. Finally she looked at me and asked what I did tonight. I was surprised and just shook my head.</p> <p>"I am here for dinner." I answered, trying to think of something to suggest. I wondered if she would ask me if I wanted something. I did not know what she thought I should ask for, but I did feel I should talk.</p> <p>"We just had a wonderful dinner, so I hope it had anything to do with you and I." I hesitated while trying to think of what could possibly be a reasonable topic.</p> <p>"I know we have, but I don't like to bring up things like that." She replied. "As for how to make us late, I won't tell you that." She added.</p> <p>"Okay." I agreed. I was hoping it was just that. My thoughts were scattered and I had a sinking feeling that I had just blown a possible chance to spend time alone with her.</p> <p>When she had sat back for a few minutes she leaned over and asked if I had any more to drink or didn't want anything else to drink. "Yes, why not?" was her response. "I think you should finish that up and go home." She suggested. "But I have so much to tell you I need to take my mind off of the situation."</p> <p>"Okay." I said as I took her hand and started to drive.</p> <p>As she drove away she reached over a moment later and pulled me toward her. Then she looked into my eyes and said, "I'm sorry I've let it go too far tonight. I love you too much to be that bad." After a second she said, "I want you to tell me exactly how you feel about me."</p> <p>We had just finished making some small talk when we turned into Ann's driveway. I put my hand up to shield my eyes, but she reached over and touched my hand with hers. "You're right, I feel much worse about this than I had to admit." She said. "My family won't be home for a week and so I think I'll just pick up everything I bought today, and then go home. I won't be a stranger for a while." She added.</p> <p>I opened the car door for her and followed her inside.
