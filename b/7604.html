I'm not your type, you know, you may not be interested in a girl that wears make-up or something."</p> <p>"I don't know any one in the room who'd rather not be my type."</p> <p>"So no one can see that you have a thing for blondes, you know."</p> <p>I looked over at him. And for some reason I felt...inadequate. Maybe I was thinking hard and thinking right, but he didn't seem any higher than me. I thought of my friends. I think I'm not really interested in dating girls, but sometimes I just like being around the opposite sex. The things I've heard about blondes and blondes' notches that make up for things I didn't know were just silly and stupid. But he was the only person I had I could have. I didn't know what to do. It was just that the way I acted, I didn't know what to do. I wanted some attention myself, it was kind of hard with work and all, so I let myself get into a habit.</p> <p>"I guess I do..."</p> <p>I started to open my mouth.</p> <p>"C'mon, you'll like this."</p> <p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out something.</p> <p>"Uh oh."</p> <p>"I know what you're thinking."</p> <p>He dropped something over to me and I looked him in the eye. And then he put it in his ear.</p> <p>"I want you to...taste it."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"Taste it..."</p> <p>He pressed it to my lips, just as he had in my room, but this time, it was in my mouth. I tried to lick it, but it tasted a little...I'd always tried to imagine it to be more like what I imagined in my last class. I remembered what blondes really taste like...a little cream to make things easier. I tried to think of a reason to keep it on my tongue, but it was gone again. I couldn't remember what it was. It still smelled like that, more than me. It was still not that appealing, especially if I was wearing a long dress, but I could remember the feel of it against my skin.</p> <p>I was a little taken aback, then, and then a little scared too. I was still a little taken aback. I was nervous, but I was also excited. I wondered how it would feel, to do it in front of him...in person.</p> <p>"Don't," I said, just barely. "I didn't...that is what I wanted."</p> <p>He had a thoughtful look on his face. I wondered if any of this was all that it wanted. All of this had happened in dreams, with a bit of a chance, but it wasn't really happening. What kind of girl do you think I would be? All those girls seemed like what I knew, and who I had known. I just wanted to do that. That's all I could get out.</p> <p>"Now, if you want to..."</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed me, his lips pressing against mine. I felt myself opening up, wanting that kiss, but I didn't want to do it right then. The taste, the feel, it was too sweet, too...</p> <p>"Mmm." I tried not to think about being a silly girl who just liked to think she was someone else. I tried not to think about wanting everything to be right because maybe I had that feeling from just before. Maybe I just wanted to please a friend. Maybe I only wanted to please myself, that I thought it was right, maybe I just thought it was kind of good that the friend I was interested in was someone who wasn't really interested in me, no less into me as a kind of person.</p> <p>I think I'd still wanted it from a boy's point of view. He put his mouth on mine, and I felt him part my lips and press them against mine. He held the kiss, just like I'd done with him. What kind of girl was I? What kind of girl would I be to even consider that? I was not the girl he was interested in. This guy was different somehow. Why were I interested in him? Was it something I had to do for me the first time? But I was excited, all excited and all excited for this man. And to be honest, I kind of liked the idea of being a girl. Especially having a guy who I wanted to be with, that being someone who had a thing for someone whose boyfriends she was interested in. It was a weird feeling to own up to everything about me. But now that I'd given so much to the idea, it might not be so weird. I could just be as pretty as the guy I thought about and fantasize about and itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
