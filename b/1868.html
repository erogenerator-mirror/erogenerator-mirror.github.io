After checking in at the Hilton, I went straight to bed. The first thing I did was to start thinking about what had just happened while I slept. I had gone back and forth between not knowing or believing what happened last night and wanting to know more about it. Finally on Thursday I sat down at my computer and started reading over the history. My only complaint was that I was too upset to concentrate on the search results because the answers to those questions were so different from the answers posted on the Internet. There was the one that took my virginity and the one I told my parents that I was a virgin.</p> <p>The next week I had no idea if any of my family could get me out of there and I did not tell them. It was also only a weekend and I was supposed to come to work on Friday to pick up the car and so I was not getting a chance to say goodbye before leaving. I didn't get a chance to find out what had happened during the weekend either until Friday afternoon when Dad said in a loud voice.</p> <p>"Dad, I'm so sorry but I gotta go find a place to stay tonight, you know, for two more nights. I'm sorry."</p> <p></p> <p>The next day was a blur. I spent all day looking at sites on Yahoo to see what was out there with people from outside of the city who had come up with what we wanted. My cell was ringing at 5 in the afternoon when I got up to get something to drink. Finally at a light out of my sister's car I went out. I walked around the corner to an open-air bar and saw that it was not even closed. I walked back in to the bar and sat in the chair that I had brought along.</p> <p></p> <p>"Daddy? What's taking you so long?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I just forgot about lunch and then was not home when you called. I just didn't know when you'd be home."</p> <p></p> <p>I took a long pull on the drink. "What time did you talk to your father?" I asked.</p> <p></p> <p>"I was just getting it out of the way after he left. But please, don't make a mistake about this. I'm so sorry. I will get him back to work in the morning."</p> <p></p> <p>"I'll drive you back." I grabbed my stuff and went to the kitchen. I grabbed my keys and was just taking them out when I saw him. He was sitting at the table with his back to us. He had on a pair of boxers and was wiping his eyes with a towel.</p> <p>"What are you doing home?" I asked. He looked up from his paper work. He had a confused look on his face.</p> <p>"I thought I got to go with you to work today. My sister is out back and I thought I'd take her out after lunch and we could enjoy some company. That way you won't have to be home when she gets back."</p> <p></p> <p>"Well then, I'll just have to take you home." I reached out and gave him a hug and a kiss on his cheek. Before I knew it I was walking toward my car. He saw me coming and looked up at me. He waved at me as I got in my car. As I was leaving he turned and smiled at me. I knew that my parents would get suspicious once I left their place and went to work. I was going to start my time in the morning as well. Maybe I would come home after I got back from lunch a month ago.</p> <p>I guess I should have called and told my sister about what I had done. I couldn't blame her for wondering what it would be like to be home alone with me all the time because she had been home all day. I thought about it a lot thinking of the things we had done during the day. "Maybe now my sister can come home after a couple of hours, then she can get rid of her hangover."</p> <p></p> <p>I could not find the phone. I got a second hand cell phone and went to the car to call my sister. She was not home all day and was supposed to meet me at home but I didn't call her up; I was still thinking. I was looking forward to seeing her in a few minutes.</p> <p>I waited till she got out of work and was waiting for her. She had told me everything that happened last night, how she had sucked my cock and how she used my cum to lube herself so that when I came inside of her she would enjoy it. She admitted that she liked it even though she didn't like it. We were going to fuck on the day that dad came home from work because he did not want to stay up too late, knowing I would be alone with my mom. She asked me to call after aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
