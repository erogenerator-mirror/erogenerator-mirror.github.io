It was a good day."</p> <p>"Well, it's been wonderful and we've all got a lot of energy and good will later, so let's just enjoy ourselves for the time being," I said and kissed her.</p> <p>"But you are home, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yep. But you'll have to just relax a few more times to keep from being turned into one of my students." I laughed.</p> <p>"Do you need a ride back? I can get a cab to the airport."</p> <p>"You know, I would like that. Let's enjoy ourselves and have a good time anyway."</p> <p>She looked at me a little funny but accepted my offer. A cab was just around the corner and I called an Uber for one of my many stops on the way so she could get a cab for another cab. As we started to get in, she said, "Wait...are you sure we can't be more than three or four weeks apart?"</p> <p>"No, not at all. That's perfect. Just enjoy yourself." I kissed her and got a taxi, paying for it.</p> <p>"We're going to be so good friends," she said with a small smile on her face.</p> <p>We got back into her house and she said, "I can't wait to tell my friends they're friends. You just have to tell me everything. They have no idea I'm a lesbian now." With that she kissed me and grabbed the clothes she'd brought and started dressing.</p> <p>I was watching the TV remote and as she started dressing, I took her in my arms and gave her a deep warm kiss. "I need your help on getting some of the things you did for me out."</p> <p>"Thanks, Mr. Evans," she said with a sexy look in her face. "If I had something to do, I'd be working a job already." I kissed her again and said, "You have no idea how wonderful it is to be able to work together in the kitchen with my wife and my sexy new friend. We love you both very much."</p> <p>She looked at me and said, "I know you love me, but I don't want a new one. I'm so excited for you to get back together."</p> <p>"The more the better," I said and kissed her again.</p> <p>I pulled on her tiaram and her pajamas and as I closed the door behind me they seemed to melt into each other. We kissed again, our hands all over each other and even my dick, which went rock hard and made a tent in my pants. I didn't know if I should touch her or hold her but decided to take this as my chance to see what her naked body felt like against my own. I kissed her again and as I got on my knees in front of her, she let out a little sigh and started to kiss my ear. I started to kiss and licked her lower back down to the small of her back and she started to moan. Her arms went around my head as she kissed my neck and slowly moved down to her shoulders. I slowly worked my way down to her beautiful breasts. They were a large, soft and pink mounds of pleasure. I kissed her nipples and then began to make my way to them. I lightly kissed her breasts and licked her nipples when I reached them.</p> <p>She was already moaning louder now and I felt her body tense up as her first orgasm was approaching. I kissed and licked my way down to her stomach and kissed her belly button. I loved it when her body tensed up and she would beg me to stop. She was panting and her hair was in the air, covering her face. Slowly, I moved down to her thighs and kissed the inside of her thighs, just to the inside of her thighs, and finally kissed her there.</p> <p>"I need you now," she said. "Lick me please."</p> <p>I moved up to her clit and began to suck on it, first in my mouth and working it. She grabbed the back of my head and pulled me up. "I need you now," she said. "Lick my pussy."</p> <p>I lay down between her legs, my dick pointing directly at her entrance. She reached down and took a hold of it, giving it a couple of strokes. She pulled it against her inner thighs and rubbed it around her swollen clit area. "I'm ready," she said.</p> <p>I moved my hips down to her entrance and slowly eased my dick into her.
