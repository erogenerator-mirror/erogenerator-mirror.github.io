I'm trying to be sexy, but you just turn me on so much,"</p> <p>"Well the more you turn me on, the more time I have to myself," And she giggled and blushed again as I leaned and kissed her neck, just below her jaw line. She moaned and opened her mouth for me to slip more, and I slid my tongue in and out of her mouth and made her squirm with delight. We kissed for a while in a blissful frenzy until she broke off and said:</p> <p>"Let's go to my room,"</p> <p>And she turned and ran through the kitchen and I followed. We entered her room, and I closed the door and took my jacket off and then undid my tie and unzipped my shirt; as I was pulling my socks off and I kicked off my shoes and socks. I put my shirt on and went to the closet and pulled out a pair of trousers. But the first couple of buttons didn't fly, so I went to the top of the closet and tried to unbutton my shirt and undid it. But as we neared the middle of the closet, she grabbed my shoulders and said:</p> <p>"Just do it,"</p> <p>And I slowly worked the top button, and with a quick pop, she yanked my shirt completely off and threw it and my pants on the chair. I took off my shirt and shoes, and then I lay my clothes on an armchair. I looked at her and noticed that her eyes were slightly glazed with lust, and she was staring hard at my bulging cock.</p> <p>"Why don't we just take off our clothes," I said to her, and she went ahead. And I followed her topless and nakedness up the steps and toward her bed.</p> <p>When I got to the edge of the bed, she stopped at her side, just staring up at me as she slowly peeled off her shoes and socks. She dropped the straps of her bra and lay on the bed.</p> <p>I started to strip off my clothes but she didn't notice until I dropped my shorts and panties, and lay on the bed facing her. "Now let's see why don't you," and she reached up, undid the string of her bikini panties and pulled her top down and off. She lay on her back, in the nude, and she looked at me:</p> <p>"It was kind of unfair, but maybe I can find a way back," and she reached out her hand, then looked directly at my cock that strained upwards at her.</p> <p>"You're a man; you should get over your lack of control," and I stood there completely nude and in her gaze, and she stroked my cock, and said:</p> <p>"Well, maybe I'll have to find a way," and she lay back down on the bed. I couldn't resist her nakedness:</p> <p>"You're mine," she said and spread her legs and gave me a perfect view of her hot pussy.</p> <p>I stood up and went to her but she stopped me saying:</p> <p>"No, I want you to do it; I am your man." Before I could object, she had my cock in her mouth and started to suck me off. Just as I had told her before, it only took a few inches inside her mouth for her to be able to deep throat me. I didn't warn her because she quickly pulled my foreskin back, and she took a huge gulp of cum right down her throat.</p> <p>"I never would have thought that it would be this good," and she licked my cock-head; I could still taste the salty salty tang of her lips.</p> <p>"How could it be any different to another guy's?" she asked, and I could tell that she was talking to me, talking about another man, not another guy; but if someone could take a hold of my cock and hold it, could a whole new world be open to all kinds of possibilities. Maybe just a guy could fuck her: if Amy wanted to take over my life!</p> <p>"No, it's okay because the man would fuck someone else, not me," I said and took hold of her hand and helped her out of her bikini panty and bra.</p> <p>I lay down on the bed and pulled her close and she leaned up and French kissed me. After we broke the kiss and looked into each other's eyes, I said:</p> <p>"I think we will have a lot of fun together," and she reached down and pulled my shirt off and helped me to lie flat on the bed.</p> <p>She lay down on my other side, and we faced each other, and we kissed and rubbed each other all over.
