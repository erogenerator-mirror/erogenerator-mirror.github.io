He could feel the softness of her skin. Her breathing coming quicker and more shallow.</p> <p>He smiled at the sight of her. He took her hand and placed it on his thigh. She felt light on her own skin. He slowly traced circles around her breasts, down over her stomach to the place between her legs. She leaned her head back against the front of the sofa as she started taking it farther. As much as he could, he pulled his pants down and pushed her legs apart. She gasped as he touched his cock. Running the head up her slit, he felt how wet it had become. He slowly ran the head up and down her slit, teasing her. He put the head up to her opening and pushed in. Her legs gave out as he slowly entered her. He leaned forward and kissed her, gently at first but with increasing passion as she moaned and wiggled. He slid in to the hilt, she moaned and pulled at his hair as he began to thrust into her.</p> <p>"FUUUUUCK," she screamed as he started thrusting in and out.</p> <p>"I can't believe it," she said.</p> <p>He laughed. "Just fucking love it. Your pussy feels so amazing."</p> <p>He leaned down and took her face in his hands and kissed her once. "Are you ready?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'll show you," she replied, grabbing his hips and helping him thrust harder against her.</p> <p>She bit her lip to stifle a scream as he continued thrusting into her.</p> <p>He leaned back, and grabbed her around the waist before he quickly spun her backwards and flipped her around. He entered her again with more enthusiasm, this time he had to break away from her and take control of the ride.</p> <p>"Where the fuck did you learn how to fuck?" he asked.</p> <p>"In my head."</p> <p>"Shit, you know. I could get you killed," he said in a slightly rough tone.</p> <p>She laughed and smiled. "But it's more fun. With more control," she said. "I love your kisses."</p> <p>The words were all that he needed. Their tongues played in each others mouths, he grabbed a handful of her hair at the back and pulled. She broke off the kiss, and looked into his eyes and smiled as she pulled him into her. Their lips broke for a second at him, before she slowly pushed him away until she was lying next to him.</p> <p>She took his hand and placed it gently on her breast, running her thumb along the edge of her shirt. He took his hand off her breast, and slowly touched her nipple. He smiled at her expression, and started moving his hand. He felt her leg twitch as he touched her again. His other hand moved toward her pussy. He began rubbing her clit, slowly at first, building her up.</p> <p>"I love your taste," she moaned. "I'm so horny, I need it..."</p> <p>He moved his hand down to the entrance to her pussy, and let his finger play over her clit. He knew she was ready. She moaned as she felt him slowly push inside.</p> <p>His finger found its mark as he pushed inside. He felt it move up towards her asshole. He moved his finger around, making his way deeper. She began moving her hips back, and he continued to move inside. Her legs bent against his shoulder as his fingers pushed deeper and faster. She could feel herself about to cum, and the idea that someone might hear was so good.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she cried as she felt herself cum hard all over his fingers. He continued to slowly thrust inside, as her pussy continued to spasm. She came for quite a while, but he managed to fuck her until he couldn't stand it any longer. He moved off of her, taking his thumb and placing it in his mouth. He smiled as he tasted her.</p> <p>"Mmmm," he said as he let his thumb out.</p> <p>He got off of her and lay next to her on the sofa and smiled at her. She smiled back at him. "You know, that's not the sexiest sex position I've ever felt," she sighed, "but hey, I'm hot, so, let's do it like this." She turned to face him.</p> <p>"Like this?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," he replied, "but if we start fucking each other and I don't cum, you'll never know when you get it."</p> <p>She sat up, smiled at him and turned to face him. "So," she said. "We'll always love you."</p> <p>"I already love you," he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
