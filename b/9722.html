I was thinking about the night before and when I remembered the first time, there was no turning back now. Her hands went back up to her breasts and rubbed her nipples; I was mesmerized. I wanted nothing more than to taste both her pussy and her breasts.</p> <p>I stopped as I heard her moan and looked over at her. She had her legs open as wide as I could ever have been on my own bed. Her eyes were closed as she played with her tits and nipples with her left hand. "I feel so good, my love, so very good. Ohhhhh, that feels good! Yes, that's it.....that's it, yes......ohhhh. " She was crying out. Her hands were still busy on her tits and her hips were pumping wildly.</p> <p>"Let's do a 69." I said with a smile.</p> <p>She laughed with joy and said, "Sure, what would you like?"</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm. I like that just that way. It's good to feel the cum inside when you put it in my mouth."</p> <p>"Let me show you, Baby." She answered. "You are so beautiful and this sounds so good." she said to me as she kissed me again. "We must do it now before we get too carried away with lust, and I don't want you to be disappointed." she said as she walked around to the foot of the bed. She spread my legs up a little more and took my cock in her hand. I watched as the head of my cock rubbed up and down her pussy and she moaned when it parted her lips.</p> <p>"Ohhhh....yes! Don't stop....put it in!" she said with joy. "Come on, it's not that bad," as she opened her mouth and took my cockhead inside. It slipped inside easily and slid all the way in. She looked up at me and then looked into my eyes as she licked my cock head again and again. I reached down and spread her pussy lips with my fingertip and ran it up to her clit. She moaned and then opened her mouth wide. I moved closer to her and placed the head of my cock at her opening. She took most of it inside her and felt so wonderful as it went deeper. I held it for a few more moments then pulled it out. Her eyes were closed as she felt each inch of my cock head as it spread her lips apart.</p> <p>"Oh, yes.....yes.......mmmmmm....that's it......do it again, make me feel so good" she was saying.</p> <p>She placed my cock back between her legs and guided it back into her pussy. I started pumping it in a gentle rhythm and she started moaning louder. Our bodies were in another world now and I thought of things I had wanted to do for as long as I could remember and things would never be the same again. "Aaaaaaah!!!!!!" I started to yell as my first orgasm took over me and I spurted my cum into her pussy. She took every jolt of sperm I had to offer as I pumped and pounded my cock inside her. I did not move so I could cum and so she felt so good I could barely move. I felt like I just shot three gallons of cum up inside her pussy. It was so sexy and so erotic to touch another body. I slowly pulled my cock from her body and she moved up beside me with a smile on her face. She took a hand and moved it to my dick and started massaging my cock with her hand.</p> <p>"You have that look of excitement in your eyes when you cum. I can tell you are very excited. I am too." she cooed.</p> <p>I lay there in post-orgasmic bliss. We had become too far along this path and we had taken what we could to the limit. We were both excited by what we had done. It was all about us now; what was at stake. We had both felt the same feelings of excitement as we fucked each other and we both felt so free.</p> <p>When I felt her warm body next to me, I reached over and turned off the bed. We were both laying there, with our arms around each other’s necks. I reached for her hand and she took it and we kissed for the very first time. I held her hand as we both felt the pleasure and the excitement we both felt. After a very short time, I broke off the kiss and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"We have to, Baby. I love you very, very much." I said as I gave her a sexy smile.</p> <p>"I know, I love you very much, but I'm really beginning to feel the joy that I feel with you. It's strange and wonderful, but I feel really relaxed." she replied breathlessly—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
