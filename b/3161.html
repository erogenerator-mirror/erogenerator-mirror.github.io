Finally, he spoke to me, and it made the situation somehow worse.</p> <p>"What's wrong, sweetheart?"</p> <p>I tried to look at him through my glasses but my eyes were downcast, just an ordinary face-face that looked like her mother... but the way his eyes had gone so wide a moment ago made it almost too perfect.</p> <p></p> <p>I sighed and sat up straight. "I, uh... I just really, really don't want to do this."</p> <p>He got up and walked to me, kneeling on the ground beside me, his chin on the carpeted floor. "Shh." He stroked my chin. "There's nothing to be worried about. It's okay." He knelt between my legs and began massaging my cock with his hands, which gave me such a hard-on that I could feel myself begin leaking. I could feel a wetness gathering in the skin over my testicles as he rubbed my cock. He was making my dick so hard I could almost feel it through my pants. I pushed my fingers into my mouth, trying to muffle the moan that I was becoming desperately trying to hold back.</p> <p>Mesmerized by what his hands were doing to my dick, I began to arch my back and buck my hips trying to get as much of that hardness inside me as I could. Even his fingers felt good as they touched me. The warm wetness that was forming in my shaft, even through my clothes, was starting to make me feel as if I were going to explode.</p> <p>"You like that?" That sounded odd. "You like what he's doing to your cock?" he asked. "What else?" I could only nod. "You like being a guy's cock slut, don't you? You like him playing with your cock, don't you? I can tell. You like that hard big dick, don't you?"</p> <p>It got a lump in my throat. "Y, yes... I do. I.. " I bit my lip.</p> <p>"Oh yeah?" his finger found my straining member. "Yeah. That's it. That's how you're doing it, right? That's how you're pleasing a man with your cock. You like him playing with your dick, don't you? You like how his fingers feel as they stroke your penis? Or you like the way his big thick cock feels, don't you? Yeah? You like having his big thick cock stroking you. You like being a cock slut, don't you? Tell me when you like it too, baby. Tell me right in your ear or show me when you want the things I'm talking about. Do you like it when he's doing these things to you, don't you? Say it, tell me for real. Tell me how much you want to do it. How much you like what he's doing to you."</p> <p>I wanted to tell him, to tell him it all, to tell him all of this. But, my hands were frozen and I couldn't speak. My mouth was dry and my throat was dry and my vision blurred.</p> <p>He stood up and slid his pants down, his hard cock jutting out from his body, pointing right at me. I could see the shadow of his cock head, a clear clear droplet of pre-cum that glistened on the tip of his cock. It looked so good and I wished that I could take him in my mouth but a part of me felt scared and betrayed.</p> <p>He approached me, his cock straddled right in front of me, its skin hot on my chest. He slid an arm around my neck, pulled me towards him and began to kiss me. His hands on my neck, my cheeks and lips, his cock pressing into my crotch and he groaned in my ear. "I think I know just the thing," he whispered, "I think you're my new whore wife. My new cock slut." His words were low and rough and I could feel myself melting into him, sinking into his warm embrace. "I know you've been getting a lot of pussy, baby," he hissed, "but I think it's time I give you what you've been waiting for."</p> <p>He kissed me, his lips hard and fierce, his tongue penetrating into my mouth. His hand wrapped itself around the bare flesh of my chest and began to pull me towards him as his lips moved up my neck. My breath was coming short and fast, his hot mouth on my neck. He pushed further, sliding between me and the edge of the bed. "You're too beautiful to be married to a man like me." His hand slid down my chest, over my stomach, cupped my cock through my underwear, rubbing me as he spoke.
