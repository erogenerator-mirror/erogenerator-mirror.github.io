"I was born here, so I've been the only one here, even though it's just a bit of a dump house."</p> <p>"I'm pretty sure there's a woman here who'll love your company and you'll love fucking her."</p> <p>Hazel grinned. "Well don't stop and stop now, your wife is in her own way of thinking."</p> <p>John laughed and shook his head. "Not me to believe something as good as that. It's almost a miracle you could get laid by anything other than a dumb blonde and a drunk. The woman can be the biggest and most persuasive when she wants to take you on a night trip, and it shows, that she's got a good reason to believe."</p> <p>"She did," Hazel winked at him. "Maybe you're right."</p> <p>John laughed again. "I'll just say that when my lady wants to put on a show," he said and kissed her on the cheek. Then he walked her to the showerhead, turning the control to a full blast.</p> <p>"You like it?"</p> <p>"Do you like the show?" John asked.</p> <p>"Hell yeah."</p> <p>"Want to go again?"</p> <p>"No, I don't, I'm busy, that's all you get," Hazel laughed, but she didn't fight him, so he grabbed her hand and placed it on the hot pulsing water. "I can't just sit here, get hard ons and get hard ons," she laughed. The first blow from John's hand had her laughing harder. He didn't push his cock into her but was content to let her work on him.</p> <p>"You're so hard," Hazel said as she massaged him through his shorts.</p> <p>"You sure have."</p> <p>"That's because I just love it when you get hard ons and I can't get as much as you do. I can't cum in our house, not just any time of the day."</p> <p>John's erection had subsided, making his shorts tent out and Hazel's hand feel so hot and so soft to the touch. "Let's go to bed," he said, and took off his shorts and shirt. Then he lay on the floor. Hazel kneeled beside him and took his hardness into her hand, while he lay on top of her. She felt him swell and become harder as he hardened inside of her.</p> <p>Hazel started to slowly pump her hand up and down on his cock, and as John lay on top of her, she let him rest as she massaged his balls.</p> <p>John closed his eyes and lay perfectly still, letting her caress his cock. A few moments later, Hazel stood back and removed his shorts and tank top, kissing him before standing and letting the water turn on. Then she started to kiss him, and as they kissed and groped each other, Hazel turned the water off. They lay on the floor, and John started to kiss the inside of her thighs. A few more kisses along the way, and then he started to lick her labia and then started to gently push his tongue into her. After only a few minutes, he stopped and stood to kiss her again. "I love the way you taste," he whispered in her ear, as he moved his lips to taste Hazel's. He kissed her hard, sucking her tongue, and then moving further down, taking her clit into his mouth and sucking on it while he inserted two fingers into her.</p> <p>"That's what you like," he whispered in her ear as he fucked her with his fingers while kissing her. "You want me to fuck you with my cock, don't you?"</p> <p>Hazel moaned and nodded her head. "Let me suck your cock, John, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Then let me swallow you dry," she said and moved between his legs, licking him from his balls to the tip of his cock.</p> <p>"I do."</p> <p>"Good." John opened his eyes and watched as Hazel devoured his cock. His eyes were closed as she sucked his cock, her mouth slowly stroking up and down his length, her tongue licking the sensitive underside of his cock. It got his breath coming out quicker, which made Hazel want to pleasure him so much. When he opened his eyes again, she had removed her skirt and her panties, revealing her neatly trimmed bush around her pussy.</p> <p>With her panties aside, John put his hand on her stomach and looked at her, as she worked him.
