"Can you be a dear?"</p> <p>"Sure," he responded.</p> <p>"Thank you. That's nice." Then she turned, walked over to the bar and ordered drinks for all.</p> <p>"Thanks for coming today," she said. "It was a pleasure meeting you." She looked over at her husband again. "Honey, what can I get you to drink?"</p> <p>"I'm a little short. You're looking good," he said. And they both laughed, again.</p> <p>"Maybe another martini would be nice."</p> <p>"You're not very good with those. You're just a little nervous. Let me buy you a drink."</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"What's it to you, honey?" she said, looking as if she were going to ask, but then paused.</p> <p>"I just don't know. My first time having a drink with you? I just didn't know what to do."</p> <p>"I know. You didn't even know that I had one either."</p> <p>"Sorry. I'm just a little nervous." He watched her. Could it be that she had a different interest in him than he did in her? A long pause, then: "Would you like to go out on the town?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Maybe, if I'm more comfortable," she replied. She was still watching the TV while sipping on her martini. Her husband watched her out of the corner of his eye.</p> <p>"It will seem strange. If you do, why not? They aren't exactly local bars." He couldn't see who she was looking at, at all. Maybe he had been staring at her. Then he thought that she was just looking out of the side of her eyes, but she kept smiling. She finished her martini, took another sip, and looked back at the TV again - but her eyes were still on the TV. She put her arm over her chest, and put her drink down. "It's really nice, and I can tell you that I like that." She took another drink, and then stood up. "Let's go." With one hand she began to gather up her handbag, with the other she walked away from the booth and put it where she had left it on the chair. She was still looking directly at the television.</p> <p>"Honey, take the drinks back to your wife." His eyes followed her.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Honey, if I put down a dime on the table beside you when you're out on the town, don't ask the bartender."</p> <p>"Okay." She picked up the money in her palm. She took a big sip of her martini, and then looked at him as she did it.</p> <p>"Please, take one for yourself."</p> <p>"Sure. I don't have much to drink. I only have a very nice vodka martini." Then she looked back at him, held out her hand. "Oh, that's nice."</p> <p>"No, really," he said. They both held their own. "It's the same brand."</p> <p>"Well, I thought you liked it a little more than that."</p> <p>"I liked it a lot more than that."</p> <p>"I thought so," she said. "How much more?"</p> <p>"What do you like?"</p> <p>"More expensive."</p> <p>"I'm glad that's the case. I wasn't really sure how to do a good, honest-to-God drink."</p> <p>"That's not what I was driving," he said. "I was just wondering if you could put something on it to be a bit nicer."</p> <p>"I could put something on it. If you don't mind." He walked over to the bar and poured her a couple of martinis.</p> <p>"No, thank you. I appreciate your concern and your concern. I just...well...well...I really don't know what to make of it."</p> <p>"Here's something," he said. Then he came over and handed her and a couple of dollars to her husband for her and his martini, both of which she handed to him. "Thanks." She sat down on the same chair. "That was very nice of you to do that."</p> <p>"Thank you," she said. "I really enjoyed our conversation."</p> <p>"Hmmm. You did?"</p> <p>"I think I may have made quite a bit of a show of it."</p> <p>"Oh," he said. "We don't have to do that again."</p> <p>She laughed. "Sure, it's nice to have someone around the place. You always make a great bartender." She leaned forward so her martini was sticking out of her mouth.
