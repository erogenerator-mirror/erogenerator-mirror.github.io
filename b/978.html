The two of you were together all by yourself.</p> <p>Well, I'm going to go out and get a drink, while I still have some other people to watch for a bit.</p> <p>"Don't forget to take care of the girls!" I whispered to you when you came back.</p> <p>"Will do," were the only words you spoke, but I could not see what you were thinking. I am not a jealous person – at least not to begin with.</p> <p>So, I went out with you. Just like this whole night.</p> <p>The night went by in a daze, as we talked, we talked, we talked, all the way to closing time. When we got to the bar, she came over and said "My name is Samantha, nice to meet you." She gave you a hug and gave you a tight hug that would have melted chocolate. As I approached, I could not believe how beautiful you were. You seemed the type to wear a whole lot of make-up.</p> <p>As we left your little party, I asked "Where did you get to?"</p> <p>"In a few minutes I saw you talking to her in the elevator."</p> <p>I went back to the crowd of people to get her another drink before I left she went to a friend to give her a kiss. I think she kind of wanted to be kissed. It was sweet, but just as I had been thinking about that kissing kiss, I started feeling aroused. I can't say how I felt, but the situation was exciting me.</p> <p>Just as we got to the bar, she kissed me again, like in the elevator.</p> <p>I told you about your kiss a little later. When you left, I did you a favor, for what I had planned.</p> <p>When you left, I wanted you to get out of your clothes.</p> <p>I was in the middle of taking a shower at the end of the day.</p> <p>Sally had told me you would be taking her to your hotel, so we had our time to ourselves.</p> <p>"What time is it?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Around one-ish."</p> <p>I went down to the end of your bed, stripped in no time and waited for you to come back. I then asked her if she would like to come to my room. She said her husband was out of town for a whole weekend, and would probably be gone by the time she got back.</p> <p>We then went to her hotel, got in bed, started kissing, and having some of the most intense sex we had ever had. While we were fucking, you were still in your robe, as I tried not to put on any clothes, I could not imagine I could get a hard-on seeing you in a wet robe.</p> <p>I just went crazy in bed, you were so beautiful, her kisses were so gentle, you could be naked, and we could kiss like we have never been kissed before - or have never done before, and still are.</p> <p>I had never felt like that before.</p> <p>She had left me a note to call her from the airport. She said you would be in her room for a few more hours, and she wanted to be alone with you, so come to her door, please.</p> <p>I waited for you to get back to your room, and I wanted you to take off your robe as slowly and as seductively as you could.</p> <p>As your friend was sitting, you could almost see me in the mirror in the bathroom. So, you did it, right on the bed. I knew what was coming, but you had no idea.</p> <p>And, I saw you in the hallway in just your robe. I can't get enough of you with that robe on.</p> <p>Your friend came to your door slowly, you came to her door slowly. I could hear you whisper as I had.</p> <p>"I am taking you to her room".</p> <p>I was trying hard not to, but I couldn't. I could tell it was very hot. You are one hot woman, and I cannot believe your sex.</p> <p>As you got closer and closer, I saw your friend come quietly into her room. She was sitting on her bed, her robe still on. You could see the look of lust on her face and the look of lust on yours. She has this look about her that says she has wanted to be with you as long as you and she will keep it a secret.</p> <p>Your friend went to get a pen and paper and she had it ready. It looked like a phone order form, and it said -</p> <p>"She will come to my room at one am. She will be waiting in my room as you wait for her."</p> <p>You could only hear the sound of your friend coming to your door and taking your key to get in.</p> <p>After just saying—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
