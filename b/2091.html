I'm glad you found it. So, when are you getting married?"</p> <p>I knew exactly what that was. I had a good idea, in a way, that I wanted to be in the wedding for real. It might not be that great of a marriage, but the way I felt about it was that we should be together. We'd gotten past our marriage talk.</p> <p>"Almost three months."</p> <p>"That's long enough."</p> <p>"Why?" There was a tone of defiance in my voice.</p> <p>"To protect you."</p> <p>"You don't want to see me naked, do you?" She looked genuinely hurt by my sarcasm.</p> <p>"Do we have to be such a pair of puppies?"</p> <p>"Yes," she almost croaked. But I had made her a deal: either I was too stupid to find out what she meant to me as I put on all my underwear and then left. Or, after the wedding and a week off, I'd find out anyway. And by then, I already knew that our relationship would never be the same again.</p> <p>"Don't look so worried," I said. "The wedding's on and we're going to be a couple of hundred people, right?"</p> <p>"I'm not worried," she said, with real warmth in her voice. "And we're not going to have sex. We're going to make love."</p> <p>"I would never cheat on you. And I assure you, no one will ever lie to you about anything."</p> <p>"That's what makes this so funny," she said. "I just mean, we can be, for all of us, in love for this time. No one will ever make you a liar before you're engaged, but not you either."</p> <p>I wanted to tell her that I hadn't meant to ask her that, but it didn't occur to me to do so. We kissed before we left the store, and I headed home, and she was on an airplane waiting for me to pick her up.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>My heart jumped when she got off her plane, and when she was standing beside me in the airport foyer. My best friend's fiance had already left and that suited us right as it went: she was going to marry us.</p> <p>I smiled at her when she turned and saw me standing there. For some reason, the look on those two faces was priceless. And when I looked over at my fiancé's fiancee's girlfriend, my hand snaked down, as if surprised it found anyone's lips.</p> <p>"I'm so happy," she said immediately. "Congratulations."</p> <p>"We were just coming to confirm, actually."</p> <p>"That was nice. Well at least as soon as I got off my plane, and then you were, well, I'm so happy for you," she added.</p> <p>As she got off of her plane and was about to close the deal, I shook my head, with a wince, and said, "I'm a dumb idiot," and she just laughed again.</p> <p>She leaned in and kissed me lightly on the cheek, and asked, "So why did you get married?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I said, taking her hand and leading her out of the airport.</p> <p>"Oh," she said and I laughed when she caught myself. "That's so stupid, and so, so crazy."</p> <p>"Why did you have to put yourself through this?" I asked.</p> <p>"There is no need to be worried about the whole damn thing." She hugged me tight. "No one is going to come between us like you know I'm going to. I love every minute of it. And if you think I might want to go another round of my own party one time, that would ruin all good for me."</p> <p>"It'll be wonderful."</p> <p>"I know, that's all. I think I'm going to like it though. I have everything lined up for you—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
