She moaned into his mouth as his fingers reached between their bodies. She was already dripping wet and he could hear the moisture of her excitement seep from inside her and she gasped when he entered her with his fingers. She shuddered and pressed her body up into his as his fingers pushed inside of her.</p> <p>Sherry wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him down to kiss his lips. He felt her passion spike within herself and he slid his hands down over her thighs to slide his own up under her dress and begin to push the lace hem over her knees. He leaned down and kissed her again while he slid a hand beneath her and slid two digits into her.</p> <p>Sherry grabbed the back of his neck and leaned back, moaning and pressing her pelvis harder against him. He had to press his fingers against her as she began to buck her hips faster. At some point her lips had reached his ear and she was whispering "God, yes. Yes...do it. Make me fucking cum."</p> <p>He pushed hard against her clit and she ground her pubic bone up against the fabric of his clothes. He slid a third finger up inside of her and she arched into him as her hips rocked up against his hand.</p> <p>With shaking hands, he lifted his hips, forcing his dick into her. Sherry had to pull back because he had only put his cock against her opening several times and it was still so thick that she couldn't wrap her fingers around his thickness. He leaned down and kissed her again. He could imagine her moaning and moving against him, but he couldn't help himself from doing what he must just do to her.</p> <p>Sherry reached down and pulled his shirt up over her head and he unbuttoned his buttons again and slipped his own shirt off of him while kissing him hungrily.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she murmured. "I love watching you, baby."</p> <p>He couldn't believe it for a moment, but suddenly Sherry felt his hand moving from her inner thigh, slipping under the edge of her dress and sliding it up under her to her chest as he buried his face in the curve of her shoulder and neck. She shuddered, pressing against him, trying to get more of herself into her as he nibbled her ear.</p> <p>"Sherry, you are so beautiful!" he said softly, brushing his thumb over her erect nipple between his fingers as she gasped deeply and arched her back, pressing into his hand.</p> <p>He moved his lips from her neck to her mouth and once again she felt herself begin to become overwhelmed, as he moved his mouth from her mouth to her neck. He could feel the sweat on her forehead as her eyes closed and she moaned into his mouth while her arms fell to his sides. Sherry had never felt truly loved by a man before. The feel of his hands against her and the taste of him was enough to almost fill her with warmth. She had a moment of terror that she might break it off with him because she feared what they might think of each other, but then the moment was broken when he slid his body down hers and kissed her. Again she could feel him pressing against her, but then his kisses turned to one another just as quickly as they had started it.</p> <p>He kissed her again, slipping a finger between the soft puffy folds of her pussy, touching her there as her hips twisted around his hand. She could feel herself leaking through the fabric of his pants and could no longer deny herself any longer and began pushing up to him so he could wrap a limb around her neck while he continued to kiss her neck.</p> <p>They were silent for a moment, Sherry trying to decide how she should feel about being completely alone in a room together until finally her breathing began to steady again and she pushed against him forcefully and reached down, taking his fingers inside of her body and rubbing her clit, while simultaneously sliding her tongue against it.</p> <p>She moaned and shuddered as his lips pressed against her. "Oh, god," she groaned loudly, "I have never felt like that before."</p> <p>"I know," he said, kissing her neck and working his way lower while he unbuttoned his pants and slid them down his legs while they continued to kiss, he began to slide his hand up between her legs again when she pulled his hand from his underwear, rubbing her clit while he lifted his hips and thrust his cock into her.</p> <p>"Oh," she gasped again as she felt his fingers press against her and stroke along her entrance. "It feels so good, but I...I don't know about being inside of you...but I don't even know if I'm ready for that..." she couldn't even say the last part of what she said to him.</p> <p>"Soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
