I think that's one day we're going to have to think about this, don't you," she said.</p> <p>It may seem sort of crazy, but right now, I couldn't even find anything to argue with. So I let her do the talking.</p> <p>"That means that I'm going to take off work tomorrow," I said. "If that means that I'm going to do anything with you and you won't have to sleep with me, then that means that I can have you naked and having sex. Or even just on a bed," I concluded.</p> <p>"What, am I supposed to sleep with you? You're not going to take up what has to be someplace, are you?" she asked. "How am I supposed to sleep that long without seeing you naked?"</p> <p>"Well, you're naked too don't you?" I offered.</p> <p>"No," she said again. "But..."</p> <p>She stopped speaking, and then leaned down and kissed me as we kissed. Her tongue in my mouth, mine in hers, and I was overwhelmed with emotion.</p> <p>"I have a surprise for you," she murmured, her hand on my hip caressing. "In fact, I have some clothes you can wear, if you want to."</p> <p>And she left the room without so much as removing the bedding or removing her robe.</p> <p>As soon as we were alone, she was stripping off her cloths. She lay on her back naked while I stripped the rest of my clothes off. She seemed pleased with her body, of course, and as I lay beside her, touching her, kissing her, running my fingers through her hair, I felt like if she'd do anything to show it.</p> <p>For a moment I stood there in my boxer shorts.</p> <p>"Just stay right where you are, baby," she said. "Just breathe."</p> <p>I was nervous that I'd be getting a blowjob because I really hadn't liked that or that was just an expression. If I felt nervous or ashamed, then just leave it for later. I couldn't help being a little uncertain even though she wanted it.</p> <p>I was sitting up now when she began pushing me back and laying atop me. Her breasts were soft and hot, with a big hard nipple pressing into my chest.</p> <p>"I just wish you could see," she moaned.</p> <p>"How?" I asked.</p> <p>"I wish you could just see me," she said. "Oh, it's just, you know, just so beautiful, like that."</p> <p>"Do you like me?" I asked. "Like I'm beautiful, like I'm..."</p> <p>For long seconds, she seemed to be lost in the sensations of my body. Finally she said,</p> <p>"I like your mouth and you, but I've never sucked a cock before, have I?"</p> <p>"No, baby, I guess not," I said. "You're not supposed to expect it from a new lover."</p> <p>She started giggling and saying things I didn't understand, but I was suddenly very nervous again.</p> <p>"You do kiss and you love doing it," she said. "Or should I say you do lick and then suck me?"</p> <p>"Um, no," I said. "That's just not allowed."</p> <p>"No, of course not!" she said. "You're not supposed to do it, especially not without permission, right?"</p> <p>"You said something about oral sex, right?" I smiled.</p> <p>"Yes, I did," she said. "We can practice some." She went over to the nightstand on the other side of the bed. She took out a strap on and lay on her stomach.</p> <p>"Let's use your mouth," she said. "I want to lick and suck and take a big load out, right now."</p> <p>We'd already been practicing on her face and tits, and I was already a little uncertain as to what she was going to do. I watched as she turned over her shoulder, lifting her ass in the air.</p> <p>"Use your tongue to lick me," she murmured, and I saw her luscious lips and pink tongue sliding across the head, which seemed just bigger and bigger, and then disappear as she pushed her head back. One long, smooth lick across my tongue, then a little deeper into her mouth, then down again.</p> <p>"That's it, Baby. Like that," she said. "I love it. Do that again. God, you're so beautiful."</p> <p>And it wasn't quite enough to stop her. She took me into her mouth once more.
