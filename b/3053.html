"I don't want me to change my mind, and it's just an excuse for what happened last weekend. Well, with it being a holiday weekend."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I can definitely see why you are so into it. There's no other way we can go, though it'll still be fun."</p> <p>"I can't wait."</p> <p>I kissed her good-bye.</p> <p>She was right. The day had just dragged on. The next day was Thursday, and I woke to one of the most beautiful sights I'd ever seen. It was as I looked through the window, I was sure there was a naked man waiting for me, at the moment, for the sight of his penis, and perhaps its twin as well.</p> <p>I found my hand up the sheets, and could feel the wetness that had already begun to moisten. The sight of his body was very hot, and my own penis was straining against the thin material of my pajamas.</p> <p>"Mmmm... yes, it is," I heard him groan.</p> <p>He'd pulled the sheet even closer to himself as he approached, and I could see that his penis was now fully erect. He pulled it to his left hip, and put his hands on my own. I wasn't sure if I was feeling jealous or excited; in fact, I hoped this was not jealousy. Not wanting to seem too desperate, I put my hand gently on his.</p> <p>His fingers encircled my own, and he gently pulled on my right index finger.</p> <p>I was mesmerized, watching the way my own hand explored the young mans body. Even as young as I was (and just a few months older than him himself), I could picture him as every female I had ever had, or as every woman I had loved.</p> <p>As soon as I touched him, I could feel that familiar tension building. He was responding eagerly.</p> <p>"I'm going to suck that," he said between breaths.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, sweetie, I'm going to have the same fun," I replied excitedly. "I'm going to taste your sweet spunk, and swallow your hot, sticky cum."</p> <p>"Mmmm," he said, as he began to rub his penis and his other hand slowly pumped me. The fact that I could see, and enjoy, every little movement caused a little tingling sensation right where his hand stroked me, and I had to shift a little to try to keep from cumming right then.</p> <p>"Oh, God, you feel so good," he began whispering in my ear, as his hand pumped me harder.</p> <p>"Cum in my mouth," I heard him say. "I want to taste you."</p> <p>I could not say why I encouraged him, as I never could, but I did, and quickly, he pulled away from me.</p> <p>I watched as he looked down at me, and saw that we had an erotic conversation going on.</p> <p>"So, babe," he said, "have you ever been with a woman, before?"</p> <p>"No," I replied, and then I giggled. "Not just anyone!"</p> <p>"Then let me have first go, and then you can have the second go."</p> <p>I was not sure how to take this. It was so exciting, and so dangerous, so exciting, and so dangerous.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>With a nod of his head, he quickly took off my pajama bottoms. I had to be ready after all. I could not wait for his hand to slide into me.</p> <p>I felt the hot tip of his large erection enter me, and heard him moan as he thrust in, slowly, steadily.</p> <p>For some reason, I felt that there was no turning back now. I felt like a young girl, being penetrated by her first true penis.</p> <p>There was no doubt in my mind that we were both going to enjoy this. That night was the first time I'd had a real dick in my body. I've always enjoyed my sex, and never had had a man in my body. Now, with someone's penis, it was the real thing.</p> <p>We were moving together slowly, and for a couple of minutes we just lay there. I could feel what had been a few minutes before beginning to rise as he seemed to move slowly, as if adjusting something in his body, as I'd done to him the night before.</p> <p>Then, to my surprise, I was about to cum, and I began to push myself onto and into him.
