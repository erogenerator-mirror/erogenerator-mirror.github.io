It wasn't unusual for him to be at his desk by then, looking up at the clock and starting his usual monologue about his business. He had never felt this way before, his secretary had never been able to put it down to the lack of communication between him and his business end. She could be on some damned deadline, as usual, and the only thing she could get out of this was that it was important to get a contract on the matter, and his work was more important to him than some damn paper clip he could have shoved in his back.</p> <p>He felt like she had to be giving him the impression that she had not just given him a handjob; that she was giving him a blowjob as well. He glanced over at the clock and thought about how badly she had come. This was probably a good thing in his book as she had almost made him cum for the third time in the space of an hour.</p> <p>It also helped to take his mind away from the distraction of his office for a moment, after all, if he had not made such an issue of it when he came in he might have been able to concentrate instead of obsessing about the details of her session.</p> <p>"What is it about that clock?" he asked quietly.</p> <p>"Oh, well for one thing it's not the clock, but the other things," she replied, "This clock, it's been on my mind a bit, as you know. Last weekend, after my phone conversation with Julia, I was sitting in the break room and I had that terrible time with my phone."</p> <p>"Ah, yeah..." he said, "So, you've been busy all weekend. I'm not sure, how do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, well, you might say that I was just thinking about you. In the break room," she paused, "well," she shrugged, "you know, you just might be better prepared than her."</p> <p>At a more normal speed, he said, "You know, I'll take that as a yes."</p> <p>"Well, do what you have to, I'm not gonna tell you anything. Just make me do all that again or you'll tell Julia she can and have the whole thing."</p> <p>"What exactly does Julia want? Is there something wrong here or is she just having an out-and-out tantrum? It's quite clear she's not really all that bothered by you after all."</p> <p>He looked a bit surprised that this was really going this way. He had expected this as one of those things where she asked him for advice when she had a bad day at work, or even a day-on-to-call-it-back kind of session. He also wondered if she wanted a session with him before she got her phone call. He decided against asking, that he didn't really care how long it would take.</p> <p>"I don't know, I guess I'm just a bit surprised I don't hear anything from you."</p> <p>"Don't be too sure, it's pretty standard," she responded, "You probably haven't heard from me again. Are you sure everything is okay? I really think you might still have trouble keeping an eye on her if you didn't," she paused for a few moments before continuing once more, "I'm sure you have a lot to think about, but we will have to see later about that."</p> <p>"You're right, okay," he agreed, "I guess I won't get off the ledge too easily."</p> <p>He looked at her, unsure what she was even hinting at. She was right. He really was having trouble keeping up with her, or that she was making progress in getting him off the ledge. In all of these other ways it was obvious that he already knew he was not really ready to be on his own on this issue.</p> <p>"I'll just keep going on it, maybe it won't do you any good, if you are sure you don't start to worry about me," he said hopefully.</p> <p>"Hey, don't worry, you'll get to hear something later," she stated, "If we continue with just you and me, I will come over to your desk and you can work with me some."</p> <p>That sounded okay, he thought to himself, but it would take some time to work out all of this. So what would be the point. It was very important to keep her on his mind again, but she just might want to let go of her worries, once he had calmed her down aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
