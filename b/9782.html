"That was one of the most wonderful blowjobs I have ever had. I can get that feeling every time," I said as I started to run my hands up and down my boyfriend's body. "I've always had an idea if I was to let you do this to me, but, I really don't know if you have the chance to experience that yet," I said with a little giggle.</p> <p>"Yeah, me too," I said, "I'm sure you've had a few before, don't you remember last summer and this summer? I would love to do that to you," I asked him, giving him a look.</p> <p>"Me too. You wouldn't believe the number of times I cum," he said reaching over to me, giving me a firm hug.</p> <p>"You did that so many times!" I said holding his hand even tighter. "And if I really, really like the way that feels, we could get into my bed," I said giving him a look.</p> <p>"Really? I didn't know we were going to do that," he said back. "I think I'd rather do this with you than with some stranger, so I'll just have to ask," he said kissing me.</p> <p>"Well, we better get to it," I said, kissing him again, moving a hand toward his lap.</p> <p>"But, what about your car?" he asked back.</p> <p>"Don't get started!" I said laughing. "What's the matter with you?" I asked again, pulling on his hand a little more tightly.</p> <p>"Oh, well...." he said looking a little uncomfortable. "I just...uh, we need to take care of all that," he said with a little laugh. "We don't have time tonight...."</p> <p>"That's okay. You said you need to take care of yourself and well, you're a young couple now. What makes you think I need to take my underwear off?"</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean," he said back. "I'm, uh, kinda worn out from work," he said quickly. I pulled his hand around so that it was in my lap, my finger right on the spot. "Now, I'm sorry," he said looking me in the eye. "I was kind of hoping for something better to come out of the bedroom. I'm sorry if I made you do that."</p> <p>"Don't be!" I said. "But you'll have to do something for me. I don't mind you taking your underwear off after all," I said with a laugh. "I think it's probably best that we do it after an orgasm," I said, looking him up and down. "Do you mind if I rub you a little?"</p> <p>"Not at all," he said sounding a little unsure about it. "Just put your hand on my side and rub it as you go into it," I said with a smile. I felt him lean backward so that I could get comfortable with it. He didn't resist at all. "Mmmmmmpphhhhaaaa..." he groaned, moving a little. "So, do you like to go to the bathroom, too?" he asked as I started to rub the front of his thighs in slow circles.</p> <p>"Yes," I said just as he turned his head away. "And you're not too much of an idiot, too." He looked as if he already could see my hands as they moved around his thigh. "Here do it," I said reaching out to him, my breasts pressing firmly against his chest. "Just hold it for a minute or two," I said as I started to rub his arm.</p> <p>When I thought he was really starting to squirm a bit, I turned more toward him and looked toward the stairs. "I don't see any clothes yet," I said, looking up at him as we both stared. I wasn't sure if I should let go, but then I turned back a bit to him. "Come on, lets go upstairs and you can pick out something to wear," I said as I reached out and started shaking his hand. "If you'll let me go back to my room," I said and then led him back down the hallway. Before I got to my room he was already inside. When I got back to my bed there wasn't much, just the door in the hall and two side room chairs.</p> <p>But, I couldn't help it. I started to lay a couple pictures on the bed as he leaned forward, his arms up on them so he could hold them as he kissed each one. "So, do you think that you'd be OK wearing a shirt and boxers," I asked?
