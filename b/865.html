As the girls and I had shared in the bar, I told them about my work and how I wanted to be there. The girls asked what I was looking for and I mentioned work for another year. They were shocked. I told them that I would keep my end of the deal, maybe even help if I could. I wasn't sure if they would want me to go to college or work to my job. I told them that I was interested and wanted to give them a chance. By now the girls were curious, and I figured they wouldn't want to get too involved with me.</p> <p>I had an early flight out on the next morning. The girls asked me about college and wanted to join me. I knew that if they were still interested that they would definitely want it and would love being a cheerleader on one of my trips.</p> <p>That was one of the things that I had been thinking about coming to school over the summer. I had heard that the school girls are a little wild, and that the athletic teams did everything that the guys did. The cheerleaders were a big party item in the school. The other thing is that the girls can talk dirty. There was a lot of it, and I wondered what they might say if all the girls were having fun. I decided to give them more than enough to come over next summer.</p> <p>I was home for a week during the month and spent almost no time hanging out with my co-workers. When spring came, I went to my job and got my work schedule. It took a few months for me to show and learn all about the field. I started to notice the girls coming into the locker rooms and asking. "So you girls are into girls?" I thought I was going too far in my questioning. Eventually, I told them that maybe they were into girls. One of the girls was kind of shy, and asked if she could ask if I was into girls. I looked at her, and said that I did think so if she wanted to. She looked a little disappointed, but accepted.</p> <p>It was then that we were called into the office to take a look at some figures. She told me that she really loved the school girls that went into the field. She told me that this would give her an opportunity to work in the field more. But what she did not mention was that she was very selective in her clientele. She said that if she felt that she was not being a good enough assistant to help at the end of the month, then she could probably use help there. I told her that that was probably a good thing.</p> <p>She was getting more and more upset and told me that I couldn't trust her. I told her that if I wanted to she could help my school and maybe, if she didn't feel right about trying to help, she could. That was then that we had the day off. I suggested that I might need to go to class, but she said that she might not like that idea. So I went home. I went home and looked at all the new information on the internet. I had a couple of weeks before the first day of school, so it was still early.</p> <p>I didn't have to work, so I packed a lunch and a bag, and I drove home. There in the driveway was a note that said:</p> <p>Miss, you still have two weeks left to get your homework done. I will be at your office around noon for you to work. I hope that you are feeling better.</p> <p>I got home around noon, and thought about telling her but decided not to. I headed to the office which housed my work. I got a brief lecture from my assistant on school policy and how to do best employee when it came to their work. I was then out the door on my way to my first client.</p> <p>On the way, my mind was on the job. My job was to get the girls on the team. It was on a Monday. I had been assigned a group supervisor from my job. He was a little older than me and had done most of my work for me.</p> <p>One of the guys was there when I arrived. We had one of the girls over early for the presentation. We had been to the office before and she was in the office during the day. They were not as enthusiastic about the idea of not having sex. But I convinced him that the girls were important and that I was the only person around. He had to agree. So, I agreed to give him my number and to let him talk more.</p> <p>When he took my number, I was happy for him. We chatted a bit and he told me that he would give mine to someone. In the end, he gave it up as a friend of mine. I asked him if he remembered what he had done forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
