Don't ever do anything to me so hard in my life you hurt me in a way and I'll be back down the aisle." I held you close as I pulled you off the bar stool and onto the floor. "Come on." I said as I took your hands and pulled you to the back of the bar. "Where's your car?" I asked as I looked back at you from across the room.</p> <p>"This way," you replied as you followed me out into the dimly lit parking lot. I leaned in front of you and put my lips to yours. I began kissing you passionately as my hands massaged your ass cheeks. I felt your hard cock pressed against my stomach and I could feel your hands caressing my breasts as our kiss ended. I broke the embrace and stepped back, turning slightly.</p> <p>"I can't believe this," I said as I pointed to the empty spot on the floor where I'd left our drinks, "I can't believe this! Jesus this place is unbelievable!"</p> <p>I looked over at you, "What? This place is crazy," I said jokingly. You nodded your head and smiled.</p> <p>"It must have had something to do with it." I said as I reached down took your cock inside of my own hand. You looked down at me and saw me smiling at you.</p> <p>We sat and drank our drinks. As we finished our second drink, I pulled you closer to me until your cock was inches from my own face. I gave you a seductive grin. You stood and walked to the restroom with me as I followed.</p> <p>The restroom was a small one that was painted white with light gray walls. It had about four stalls between it and the stalls. You walked by me as I opened the door and leaned against it, "What do you want to do," I asked quietly. "I want to go outside to the moon," you replied, "that's a fantasy come true."</p> <p>I took you by the hand and led you in to the foyer of the hotel. I opened the door to the lounge and turned to see a small group with a drink in their hands. You saw the moonlight shining on the floor and felt your heart rate increase as you followed me.</p> <p>We walked into the dimly lit room and as I looked up at you, you smiled, "I'm not sure I believe this," I answered. I leaned down and kissed you softly. You responded and our lips met, our breath coming out in loud moans. Our lips moved against each others, our tongues began a dance together. I moved my hands from your ass up your thighs and grabbed your hard cock. It pulsated in my hands, which sent shivers through your body. I began grinding my hips into yours causing your cock to move up against my pussy. You reached around me and began running your fingers through my hair as I began to move faster against you. We came up for air in the dim light. I looked at you and laughed nervously, "I didn't get out of my uniform did I?" I asked playfully.</p> <p>"No, I left this," you answered, pointing back to the light.</p> <p>"You have to leave the jacket out of place." I said as I turned you down the hall to our room. I opened the door and I saw you lay on the bed with a smile on your face. I smiled at you and sat down next to you on the bed. We kissed, our tongues dancing furiously. I moved back, removing my own jacket, exposing my tits to you and your eyes. I ran my hand up from my tits and down my flat stomach, over my pussy lips and into it. Running my fingers up and down my lips. I was wet with desire. I moved to your cock and slowly pushed myself down on you. You gasped and pulled my breast to you. I began to rock back and forth on your cock. Your hands gripped my hips tight as I continued to rock back and forth. I looked up at you, "I think I get the picture." I said as I began sucking you faster, my pussy taking the full 8 inches of your thick cock. I was amazed how long you kept this up. I began to bounce on your cock again, my tits bouncing, swaying on my chest. I leaned back so that just your head touched, my cunt just above your cock.</p> <p>I looked up at you as I began to moan softly. "Baby, can I?" I whispered playfully.</p> <p>Your head was against the softness of my tits, my hand playing with them.</p> <p>"Yes" you replied softly. "Yes, baby, whatever you want." I said as I continued to bounce on your cock.
