I think that means his big fat cock has a mind of its own, as soon as you come in."</p> <p>"Is that right?" I said, as the lube was already dribbling down her chin.</p> <p>"Yeah it is."</p> <p>I was kneeling on the bed, between her legs, just looking at her, and it would seem that she had just taken charge of the whole situation. Her face, her body language, her tone, her eyes...</p> <p>"Is this real... you want to see me... I bet you can't believe it... or you'd like for me to be a little older and more experienced..."</p> <p>I could not resist, nor could I resist the opportunity to push inside of her when I felt that familiar sensation of her vaginal muscles tightening, relaxing, and releasing...</p> <p>"I'll let you look... if you want... I hope that you are interested in my cock, don't you?"</p> <p>"I... I was just thinking that... that you'd get off on seeing me... and that, if I could suck it, I would want to do it."</p> <p>There was an almost sexual desperation there that I liked... but I had never been in control this time... or this position. I was being assertive, not letting up now.</p> <p>I reached between her legs and started to stroke her pussy, getting it wet with her juices.</p> <p>Her body responded to me, and she seemed to like a bit of control. I pushed her legs apart and started to kiss her inner thighs, slowly moving closer to her cunt. I started to kiss her outer lips, and her body responded accordingly, her pussy getting wet enough to make her wet enough that in anticipation, I started to kiss her inner thighs. She looked down at me, and with a smile, said "oh..."</p> <p>I moved my head near her cunt, and she reached down and grabbed my hair in her hand and said "suck me, John."</p> <p>I reached out with both hands and wrapped my fingers around the base of her cunt lips, feeling the warm wetness as she spread herself wider. I pressed my mouth against her, and pushed my tongue into her, making her pussy moisten, as the inner labia sucked me in.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels good..." she sighed as I flicked my tongue in and out of her vagina, and her breathing quickened, in sync with the waves of sexual anticipation that were sweeping through her body. I licked up to the end of her pussy lips as if in a dream, then started licking her clit as she kept her head back and moaned out.</p> <p>"Yeah, suck me! Suck my cock! Make room!"</p> <p>Her body started to shudder with excitement as she moaned "yes" over and over on the bed.</p> <p>I was very aroused by what her body had to show me, and I had been in control of myself for a few days. I couldn't see her face, not even her body... but it was exciting to hear her moaning like that. I slid my fingers into her snatch and started finger fucking her, as my other hand was still strumming her clit.</p> <p>"You ready to come?" I asked, as she started to shake uncontrollably.</p> <p>"Don't... stop...... I... I... Oh... I... I'm.... Going... to... Oh..." her orgasm was long and powerful and she moaned again, a little louder than she had before, "ohmyGod...!"</p> <p>I smiled as I felt her orgasm start at her pussy, and then continue as she let out a little scream as her fingers stopped massaging her clit, the wave came on and as we heard her moan and we heard her screaming "Oh... Oh...!"</p> <p>In that final moment of the intense climax she stopped her own moaning and made a "I love you" motion... while my body could not hold up and I had to move to move my face and tongue to help her to come down.</p> <p>When it seemed that she had enough, she sat up, and pulled me down on top of her, my hardness still hard inside her. "That... was... so... fucking hot".</p> <p>"You weren't wrong. I'm glad that you're thinking about me, the way you feel when you feel me inside you, and it makes you feel a more sensitive place."</p> <p>"No, that was the best sex I've ever had, and I think that's what it feels like when you're with me. I think I can see why you like me."</p> <p>"Well, I like youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
