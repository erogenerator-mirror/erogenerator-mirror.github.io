And I was certain I was the only one. I loved her.</p> <p>But then I was not alone, she had been mine.</p> <p>Suddenly it all began.</p> <p>It started like an explosion.</p> <p>We were both on our knees in a flash of white light, my face buried right between her breasts, my arms wrapped around her waist. And I was in love and aroused beyond anything I had ever felt before.</p> <p>I was kissing her breasts, licking her nipples. It was like the climax from the fire.</p> <p>She whispered, "Oh, David. Yes. Yes, it is true. I love you."</p> <p>My hips were still in the darkness and she pressed herself tight and rubbed herself down hard on my raging penis, sliding it up and down. Then she took it in her soft, hot and wet mouth, her silky, warm hand pumping it. She was as beautiful as ever, and a thousand years older. Oh, God! I wanted all of her!</p> <p>We both came for a long time. And finally, I was not done. But I wanted her to finish first, too. So the only way I was able to finish had to be with her pussy.</p> <p>I took care to lick her nipples. But I was too impatient, and the orgasm came more quickly if it didn't start quickly enough. But she stopped me to turn over on our sides. Then she knelt between my legs and lifted her head to my balls and she took them gently in her mouth. I had a powerful orgasm in my balls, and she had a good orgasm again. My first one of many.</p> <p>We didn't talk about it. We just talked of being together again.</p> <p>And I wanted more. I knew I wanted more than her as well as it had me.</p> <p>She smiled at me then, and went on with her "making love" with me. We were both feeling fulfilled, and I knew that it must have been more than her having the experience and also the release I had given her.</p> <p>Chapter 4:</p> <p>I couldn't believe that I could be with a woman. Who could make love to her like that? I had known for a long time I would fall in love with one of my girlfriends, but nothing like this! And it was so different from any other date; it was beautiful just as our sex life had been, I would say.</p> <p>But I wanted to know her body so I would make love to her and not try to fuck a hole in her body. My experience in sex with women had taught me that there is nothing wrong with having your own body to feel. I loved her body for all it was worth. I did not have to tell her I loved her. We did love each other, and we wanted to make the best connection possible.</p> <p>But it meant a lot to be with her that first day we were together at the beach in her new apartment. It was the first time we made love on our bed, and it was the first time I had done it with her.</p> <p>It might sound like I was a bad boyfriend for making love to her, but it was the first time I had ever made love to a woman: I needed to feel loved and desired and then to be loved.</p> <p>And even though she was my girlfriend, I didn't have a love for her.</p> <p>But I wanted to, needed to feel loved from another woman. That was what had made me the best man I ever had. I wanted to make love to her with her in her mind and in her body, because my penis could not satisfy her. I wanted to fuck her, but the truth was, I felt guilty about liking her that way.</p> <p>But I could not bear to admit it.</p> <p>I kissed her forehead, she turned to me, and said, "David, I want to be your girlfriend. After making love to you, I want to become intimate with you."</p> <p>My heart broke. And with that, I hugged her like I would have hugged her if you had kissed my lips first.</p> <p>"I am always in love with you, darling," we said and then I kissed her lips again. She then put her arms around my neck. We continued to kiss, and kiss, and kiss until the sun is up and I had to take a shower. Then we took off our clothes.</p> <p>We took a shower together, while she kept caressing her breasts. And I was loving it.</p> <p>She took one of the shampoo bottles and washed her hair.
