Go down the stairs and stand across from him. If you go under the stairs, he'll hit you and you'll end up in the guest room."</p> <p>"But he's not in mine. What if it comes to light? I can see through the slats the night light has on it. Besides you can't tell him that I'm not in bed with you."</p> <p>"Fine."</p> <p>"Fine? I'm not making an excuse if I get caught red handed. Now go."</p> <p>I opened the door to my bedroom and the master bedroom. I walked in and saw that there was a light on in his old room. I took a glance from the night stand and found that it wasn't locked. I could see him sleeping peacefully. He was sleeping nude with a pillow under his right arm. When his eyes opened I quickly undressed and went to bed.</p> <p>I don't remember much as I slept. I remember going back to my day of college and then a week after that I went back to work and a second semester I was in my home life until I met Jim. He and I got to know each other pretty well. In that first semester, I had met him in his dorm and we had had a night cap on our first date, so I hadn't really been aware of what he was like in bed. We dated for a while and it worked out and we got engaged. We didn't go another month before I got a call from him in a different area that he was out of town for a week.</p> <p>I had to wait a week before I did anything with him. We were a lot different then. Jim had to work in my building at night and I could tell that he had a lot of things to say. I told him that I thought it would be fun working with him and that we could start a conversation that wouldn't get to the sexual stuff. Jim gave me a big smile and said that it was only work that made me feel that way.</p> <p>A month later Jim called me at my home and we spoke on the phone for about a half hour. It had been a long time since I'd seen Jim and since a few months before about three month's ago. While we talked I started to wonder if he was in real trouble. I was thinking about what my next move would be if he ever found out I was taking a week to be with him. He asked if I were doing the same thing as he was and I was going to tell him that I was. I thought about it for a week.</p> <p>I thought that at the same time that he had been trying to find out how I was doing, I was going to let him do what he wanted with me. I knew that he would figure out what the problem when he did come up to me on the phone for a minute. He had always kept to his word that he had found a girlfriend a long time ago. The next day I got a call from him.</p> <p>"Liz, could I talk to you for about two minutes."</p> <p>"Sure, Jim. What would you like to do today?"</p> <p>"I'd like to try to find out more about you then go in to work tomorrow."</p> <p>"Yeah, whatever you want to do. I can stay up until the end of the day and we can look at the office stuff then go back to where we left off. Are there any other plans?"</p> <p>"No. Just the one thing I'd like to do. I've never done everything with another dude. It's just not something as exciting as watching a guy have sex. So how can we do it?"</p> <p>I could already hear that Jim was getting very heated with me. My mind was just starting to run around the edges, but my pussy was already getting moist. I just had to make sure that Jim would be more than a little suspicious if I told him. He already knew how I felt; if he found out I was having sex with another guy, he's a fool and is going to get mad about it. It would mean a lot to me. I told Jim that I couldn't stay home, but that if it would help any, I would take a long lunch and hang out with Jim so that he would know if I wanted to go out and get something to eat. Jim and I had always been on the lookout for the kind of fun that Jim could and didn't want to have to do that with another guy. After work I would see Jim and I could go out for lunch and have a picnic on the beach and catch up on each and every thing that happened. After work I would have to get home then back to work.</p> <p>Jim wanted to have some fun in the sack, so he started to talk dirty and talk about what he'd like toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
