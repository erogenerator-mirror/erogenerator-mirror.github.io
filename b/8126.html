He took me in his arms, and hugged me to him and his body. It was an embrace that was so loving at first, and I realized that he too was feeling just the same for me. I looked into his eyes again, and felt that I had to do something soon.</p> <p>"Cyrus, I have to go." I said, and started to get back my clothes. I pulled them out of the bedroom and put them on then rushed out the door to the door, my heart racing. I had to do something, but I had to do this now. I was going to make this wonderful husband my wife that I had grown to love as his. I made my way to the pool, and lay face down under the hot water for a few minutes, then sat in the chairs as well. It felt so good to be back in his arms. I took a sip from my soda then set the glass down. I laid my head back down on his chest and kissed the top of his warm hairy chest. I loved being with him, he was so masculine and strong, and it felt really good to just be around him like this. I could hardly move at first, but then I fell to rest on his body and just relaxed.</p> <p>I kissed his cheek, looking up at him as I did, my heart racing a little. "Cyrus, I want you too. Will you marry me?" I almost whispered, the words coming out so fast. He smiled as he replied, and we both knew we wanted to do this before the night was done or when it was over. I was shocked, I had no idea this was really going to happen. It turned out to be a very good time, we made love for about 2 hours, making me get sore and start to wonder what exactly was going to happen tonight.</p> <p>It was late when my alarm went off at 4. I looked at the clock on the desk. It said 3 am, so it meant I wouldn't be waking up till just before 9. At 9.00, I was up and putting on a robe and I checked the clock. It said 3. I decided I wanted to go to bed. I slipped into bed beside him. I turned on the light, and looked deep into his beautiful eyes as my arm was over his face. "Cyrus, please go to sleep now... It's been a very wonderful night." I whispered to him as I slowly drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>"Cyrus, please go to sleep. You can stay here forever." I said as I slipped out of bed. I made my way to my room, and put on a long cotton night gown and went back to bed. I closed my eyes and drifted back to sleep.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I heard the water run, and then I heard him moving around the house. I could hear him rustling around, looking for something. It must have been a bath or something. I was having a great time. I took my robe off and laid out in the sunlight. I heard the sound of the splashes of water on the floor as he came into the room, and then he was on me in a flash. I got my first good look at the new man before the day was done. He must have been about 6'2" in height. He was about 6" taller but that was still about 6" and I couldn't really tell. He was in jeans and a button front top shirt. He had on boots, and was barefoot. His boots didn't look very clean to me.</p> <p>"Cyrus, I'm sorry... I was just... It's been a hard night..." was all I could get out in between our kisses.</p> <p>"I know, I need you to do me." He whispered as he broke our kiss and looked down at me. I just looked up at him with a smile. He then looked down and slowly put his arms under my shirt. He pulled my panties off and began to work up the leg and inside my thigh and up my body. I reached over with both arms and raised the robe off of him. My arms came up around his neck, and he pulled me against his body. When they got there I felt him begin to work himself down my legs. His hands made their way around to my panties and slid them off. He pulled them off and moved back up onto me. I moaned as he put his arms around me and pulled me against his warm body.</p> <p>He raised up slightly so I could move my legs so it felt like we were touching. He rubbed him hard against me as he continued his work up, finally reaching my pussy. He rubbed the outside of me until I could feel myself starting to get very moist. He looked up at me, with a smile. "I could do this all night." He saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
