It won't be long before you get the hang of it!"</p> <p>With that she got off the bed and went into the bathroom to get the lubricant I always lube. She came back to me and stood behind me. "Honey I've been dreaming about us fucking for months. I've been hoping we'd finally get to fuck again!"</p> <p>"But...but I don't think I can do it."</p> <p>"Well you can do it, but for whatever reason we'll never do it. I'll never be able to do it again, we have to make up for it!"</p> <p>She pressed her body against mine and kissed me passionately.</p> <p>"I wish this would just take care of you!"</p> <p>In her hand she held out a tube of lubricant and coated me. She pushed between my thighs and spread my ass cheeks. A moment of hesitation passed over me then I felt her spit on her hand.</p> <p>She pushed a couple of inches inside my tight hole followed by a second, then a third. I felt her fingers working the lubricant around inside me. Soon my ass relaxed around her fingers and she began a slow rhythm.</p> <p>"Does that hurt?"</p> <p>I nodded and groaned in reply. It really did feel good, and I was beginning to like the attention.</p> <p>"It's a lot of fun having you stretch me! Now you can get it all out!"</p> <p>The fingers and hands were working themselves in and out of my ass as I took everything she put in my body. I felt her soft hand on my cock working the lube inside me. Then I felt it start to move slowly but quickly. I began moving against her hand as I felt the fingers working inside my body go faster and deeper, until I felt the end of the finger going into my cunt.</p> <p>"Oh baby! You're so slick!" she said as the fingers got a quick rhythm together and pumped against each other.</p> <p>As the fingers continued in my body my breath came out in ragged gasps at the pleasure she was giving me. I began rubbing wildly against her hand and could feel my body tightening up. She increased her strokes and the fingers continued in and out of my body. I could feel my hole stretching to accommodate her, the finger going wild on my pussy walls.</p> <p>"Ohhh... ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!" I said as a powerful orgasm hit me. My body jerked and pulsed as I could no longer keep feeling anything except that incredible release.</p> <p>After taking a few deep breaths she stopped moving and turned me around to face her. "I've wanted to watch for so long!" she said then kissed me slowly and deeply.</p> <p>We parted from our post-coital kiss and stood for a moment looking each other in the eye. "You're perfect!" she said in a whisper. Then she knelt beside the bed, still holding one of my arms and legs as she continued to work her fingers and hand in and out of my body. "That's the best feeling in the world!"</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>It took about a half hour to reach the hotel. I was exhausted just sitting there. We made small talk as usual and were both pretty tipsy, but the sexual tension was still strong even from the night before. She didn't seem to notice I had come into the room when she kissed me softly on the mouth. She was so sexy in her sexy nighty, the straps across her shoulders pulled up and tight over her beautiful tits. I felt so safe and protected in her arms.</p> <p>We stood before the bed then got into the bed on end. She lay down next to me on her back. I moved to her side where I was lying and ran the tip of my cock up and down her legs. She opened her legs for me to get close to her slit. I took the tip of my cock just out of her opening and started slowly rubbing her wet lips. I could feel the tightness of her cunt and the wetness. My cock got larger and larger in the confines of her pussy while her legs spread even further. I was still a bit unsure of what to do, but the feeling was so good.</p> <p>When it slipped inside her she moaned her pleasure. "This is so good! I know it's not my first time, but it feels SO good!"</p> <p>I started fucking her with long strokes and just kept working my cock in and out of her hot pussy. Her body started to respond and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
