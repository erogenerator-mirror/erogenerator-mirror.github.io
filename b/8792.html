Everyone, even the three most junior-year graduate students, sat in the bar-resting area and the four couples sat around their bar. A couple of the men were chatting together at the bar, while the other two couples were having cocktails. The women were all wearing the obligatory, slutty-cut cocktail dresses, while the men were wearing dress-and-tie cocktail dresses; a few of the gentlemen's dresses were in the same shape.</p> <p>"You all look hot," said the hostess, "and I'm sure you all thought I was having a margarita. Is it okay if you guys pour it on for us?"</p> <p>The four husbands, including the men drinking cocktails and the guy in the red dress, stood, nervously.</p> <p>The hostess went on: "Don't worry," she said, "we won't have a heart attack or get shot by you. We're taking care of you. I can't believe how sexy we found you tonight!"</p> <p>Then she looked at the six women: the men, obviously enjoying their drinks, had gotten really tipsy.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she continued confidently. "Our men are having a good time. You're all our friends: we'll all be having fun and we'll all love dancing and horsing around with you."</p> <p>The seven men were all feeling the effects (slightly) as the women did.</p> <p>"Okay, then," said the hostess, "I'm going to tell everybody that everybody in the bar got really tipsy. That means we'll all have our own margarita. So, first things first, let's try this experiment that you guys got me for you guys."</p> <p>She said this with a little grin.</p> <p>The eight men stood up and walked around the front of the bar and looked back at the people to their right.</p> <p>The men were all in their fifties or sixties. The men all had blonde hair. The women wore suits with a variety of skirts. The men were all wearing their suits. The wives had on dresses with very stylish and short outfits that included a high-necked dress jacket, button-up slacks and high heels.</p> <p>The wives were all wearing dresses at their husbands's discretion.</p> <p>"Well?" said a voice from a voice in the back behind the bar: "We'll all join us in a dance, so you all can get a quick look at this sexy show you guys got for us tonight. I guess what you're thinking is, no, you really shouldn't do that, I'm a married woman, you're all friends and we all like making you happy."</p> <p>At that moment, an older couple came up from around the corner of the bar carrying on a conversation. The husband stood next to the wife. The wife was wearing a tight skirt and a tight sweater.</p> <p>The husband looked closely at the wife. She was smiling at him and her bright blue eyes twinkled as she looked him up and down. She looked like a young girl. Her long, dark hair fell to the top of her shoulder blades. She wore black lipstick on her lips and bright red lipstick on her cheeks. She had short brown hair that was tied side-by-side in a ponytail.</p> <p>And of course, she had an unbuttoned white blouse on, which buttoned slightly enough so that her large breasts were thrust out from underneath it. The husband's eyes were glinting as he gazed at the young woman's breasts: it looked more real than a young woman's tits.</p> <p>He felt that familiar twinge of arousal in the cock that was straining against his pants with his arousal. And now the wife was in front of him with a man she'd just met half a dozen minutes ago who she'd just met half an hour ago. He looked longingly at the lovely married woman. He could almost picture her breasts swelling with each breath from him.</p> <p>He felt his hard penis pressing against his pants.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're not a married man, my dear husband?" said a deep, male voice from behind the bar. "I mean, that's right, I want to make you happy. Why don't you stand up and let us get a better look at your wives," he continued, "and then you can help us get all of our wives ready to dance in our company. That is, if you can come with us."</p> <p>The old man turned his way and said, "I don't think that is a good idea," and quickly turned back to the young couple. The young couple followed him back to the bar.</p> <p>One by one the men stood.</p> <p>One by one, the men all stood with the wife.</p> <p>The wife smiled at her husband over the man's glasses.
