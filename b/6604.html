I was so close to another climax I could feel my muscles convulsing around his cock as I cried out in pure abandon. He suddenly stopped and lifted me off him and carried me by the hand into the bedroom. I slumped forward onto the bed spent and totally exhausted. He lay back and stared at me, still hard and breathing hard, his hands still holding and holding me.</p> <p>I rolled to the side and lay on the bed. He had collapsed beside me and as my breathing returned to normal he leaned over and kissed me.</p> <p>"Thank you, John," he said, "I needed this. If anything comes up I'll call you."</p> <p>"Oh, my God, that was wonderful," I said as he got up the energy to get us both a cold beer, which he drank with a big grin on his face, "I've definitely heard of this."</p> <p>"You're absolutely right, lover," he said, "I had no idea you had that in you."</p> <p>He sat up and went to the refrigerator and got another beer and came back with the paper towels. Placing a towel around his waist and sitting next to me wiped my pussy, still half-asleep, and he handed me one and I drank. As I started to slide down off the bed my eyes opened suddenly, it was the first time I had ever come in a room with anyone. I was still drunk and shocked at first but before I knew it I was pulling the towel back and looking at it.</p> <p>"Well, looks like we're both getting a little tipsy," I said, "How much?"</p> <p>"Depends on what you want," he murmured as he lifted my face for a light peck.</p> <p>His hand slid over me and under the towel and found its way between my legs. I could hardly move, almost as if I had an electric shock. His tongue probed my mouth briefly before it moved up to my ear and he was speaking again, "This is how I like to start."</p> <p>"I know," I managed to murmur "You really enjoy this."</p> <p>"It was absolutely wonderful and I'd like to do it again too. After our little chat. You've given me a whole new experience."</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed me there, my whole body feeling the warmth of his naked body pressing against mine. I turned my face to meet him and we kissed and he ran his hand from nipple to nipple, feeling the bumps with his fingers, taking turns to rub each one in turn as we kissed. Our tongues played and I felt his cock stiffen slightly against me as it rubbed up and down against my leg. I reached for him with my hand and found it too hard for him to support his weight, with a slight twitch it jerked into life more strongly.</p> <p>He moved slowly back down and kissed and licked my belly and breasts and I felt myself responding. I could feel myself getting wet and my breathing quicken and feel the heat rising in me, aching to rub myself. He kissed down over my belly and as he got to the top, I spread my thighs, waiting his head between them and he moved his head back and looked up at me.</p> <p>"I'm not sure about this," he whispered.</p> <p>"Don't worry," I replied as he gently rubbed his head between my legs and slowly pushed it into me. A gasp came from me as his head penetrated me and just then his beard tickled my lips and the hair around them tickled my clit and I moaned in bliss. It was fantastic.</p> <p>He moved his tongue and it found and tickled my clitoris and I exploded. In less than ten minutes another orgasm hit me. He continued to lick gently up and down my slit and his fingers probed me gently as I quivered in delight. His beard tickled me some more as he licked my lips.</p> <p>"I need to go," I gasped," now."</p> <p>We separated and he took a towel and wiped himself down. He handed me the towel and I wiped myself down. He leaned over and kissed my forehead, the top of my hair and then stood waiting for me to do the same. There was no rush. He took the hair tie from the top of my head and gave me the hair tie. I'd never really tied my hair. I'd had the other girls do this but never had they done it this way.</p> <p>"You're lovely," he said, "That was fantastic."</p> <p>"Come with me," he said, "I need to lie down for a few minutes."</p> <p>I looked a little puzzled. "Lie down with meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
