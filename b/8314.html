He lifted his arms to pull her down onto him as he pumped into her.</p> <p>"Oh God ... ohhh ..."</p> <p>"Oh Baby ..."</p> <p>"Fuck ... me, fuck me, fuck Me, fuck Me, fuck me ..."</p> <p>"I ... I ... I ... ahhhhhhhhhhhh ..."</p> <p>"Fuck ... me ... I want it ... ahhhhhhh ..."</p> <p>Her legs closed around his waist as they bucked over and over.</p> <p>"Uh... ahhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn ..."</p> <p>All of his energy seemed concentrated in his cock as it was slowly pumped in and out of her pussy. The bed was creaking with her movements.</p> <p>His hands caressed her back, she leaned back to rub her breasts against his chest and he kissed the top of her throat as he fucked her with increasing speed, his eyes closed as he felt her body respond to the erotic feelings. For several minutes, he pumped her, feeling the walls of her pussy squeezing the sensitive flesh of his prick, a constant pleasure in his loins. He began to groan as he thrust in even harder, feeling the walls of her pussy contract as they gripped the length of his cock. As the pace of his hips started to quicken, he could feel the walls of her pussy moving within her, grasping and massaging her flesh as he slammed his hips forward each time they were fully seated inside her. Suddenly, he felt his face being jerked forward by his orgasm. Their mouths met, their tongues caressed each other, their mouths were locked together, as he pumped his cock into her, over and over, feeling his penis pump jet after jet of his cum into her pussy. He pushed into her hard, watching his cock as it disappeared into her, then slowly came out to the tip, followed by the last three jets before finally sliding back in.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ..."</p> <p>As he was finishing, he looked down at her and asked softly, "Are you Ok?"</p> <p>"Are you kidding? That was fantastic," she murmured, her legs still on either side of him. "That was amazing."</p> <p>They kissed and she pulled the covers over them. Then, they were silent and it dawned on them that they were about to make love in the arms of another woman. As if his mind hadn't already, his hands, fingers and his cock were busy with this woman in the arms of another man.</p> <p>As she pulled the covers over them, they looked at each other and smiled. Then suddenly, she got up and headed for the window.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>"My God!" his sister exclaimed as she entered to the kitchen. She watched as he pulled up his pants and sat at the stove cooking a hamburger.</p> <p>"I'm surprised he has such a thing about hamburgers," she said, watching as his back turned slightly at the waist.</p> <p>"That it's you two," Marie said.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's a big deal. He doesn't know much about it."</p> <p>"He does," Marie said with a smile. "He's been with women before."</p> <p>"What's the matter?" she said. "I can't believe there are so many of us who go out in the woods to see a movie on a winter's day like that. And what about us?"</p> <p>"I get it," he explained. "That we, what we really do, is just to live a normal person life. Nothing romantic and all that. You never have to worry about what or why. But, I bet there's a couple of things you don't know. Like what's in a coffee cup, or what the weather feels like."</p> <p>"I've never heard of anyone named Mrs. C." she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"Oh?" he asked, with a laugh. "That's what my mom taught me."</p> <p>"You just wait!" Marie said with a laugh.</p> <p>He turned to her and said, "It's really niceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
