"Hello? It's Emily. I thought I'd come by to say goodbye if it were you."</p> <p>"Hello. How are you? My name is Ryan." She replied and turned to leave the room.</p> <p>Emily was a cute little girl from a distant past. She had brown eyes that were deep and expressive, which she was always looking at me as the world around her. Her hair was naturally straight and brown, like she had when she was a teenager. She had bright brown eyes that always were staring at me. It took her a few seconds to make her way into my flat. When she entered and closed the door behind her, her eyes widened. She had auburn tresses that were pulled into a neat ponytail. I could see the pink of her eyes as the two met in the middle of my house. Her body seemed to be in a state of semi-comas. She had a small but very well-formed figure, which she was still dressed in.</p> <p>"Thank you for the phone call from the agency," she said as she held out her hand. She looked very pleased with herself. "It wasn't difficult at all to get a hold of you. Just have to keep in touch." She said as she took my hand and led me up the stairs. "Do you need my car?"</p> <p>"No. This is okay. I like driving." I lied, knowing that what I had to do was difficult. "Let's go through for an interview and I will run this around all the details." I told her while she unlocked and opened all the doors.</p> <p>The last interview session was just one day, and the second was a couple of days away. The fourth was the big day. Her company had just come over for a very eventful session. It was going to be like a wedding reception. I could hardly control myself as I drove my car, to see how my new employers were handling this interview, which was quite an unusual event in itself. I parked my car on a side street and followed her down the street.</p> <p>"Let's get more details first, shall we?" As we reached the side of the university house, she told me about the phone calls, all of which had ended with her. "That phone call on Valentine's Day is still ringing in my mind. Do you really want to go through with this interview?" she asked as she led me over to a coffee shop. "Yeah. That's good for me to know there is money in it," I told her. She smiled and nodded. "But I can't promise a free driver, because I like to keep in touch with my clients. But I can always call you if you want to come over. But I want you to keep in touch with me as well, so you shouldn't run out of the office."</p> <p>She made me a coffee and offered to fix some sandwiches for me. "Thanks. That's kind of the way it used to be. It's been a lot of work just getting one, but I'm glad to see it's finally over."</p> <p>"That means I won't have to keep you for my girlfriend." That had the feeling of false confidence in it.</p> <p>"That just means that I will probably have to make excuses to keep you by myself." She said. She was a very confident woman.</p> <p>We sat for some sandwiches, and I explained my decision that they were a gift to me. "I had hoped to get my girlfriend and my house in order. So I decided to get the deal done." I told her. "I told the agency I thought of you as a good choice. In a manner of speaking it is my hope that you will be my girlfriend too." For a brief moment, at that point, I realized that it seemed that someone who couldn't resist me would want to meet me.</p> <p>"That's very considerate of you. I had hoped I would have you as my girl. But now it's not quite what I need." Emily took my hand and gently squeezed. "Why don't we have a chat?" She said and led me over to the kitchen table. "How long will I have to wait before the interview, if I wait?"</p> <p>"Just a few more days. There is no rush." I reassured her.</p> <p>"That is so great! I just hope the interview lasts very well." She said, while she turned on the stove and began preparing some lunch. But she did stop long enough to ask me something.</p> <p>"So, what is your name?" She asked as she stood in front of me and pulled me in for a hug. After a few seconds of their embrace, it became clear to me that she had changed. Her face was a little more red and her hair was now in a neat ponytail from the front of the coffee shop. She had aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
