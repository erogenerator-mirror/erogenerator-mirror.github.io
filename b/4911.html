I had not dressed in a long night shirt, just in a t-shirt. "Just be a good little girl and get the door ready", I said as I pulled them into my closet. I then went back down stairs and sat behind my desk by my bed. As I had done for my life, I turned on my computer so it was as if the screen was never left open. As I started it up I started to type my password. I clicked for the first time. "Open up". It took a few seconds to type the command but it was clear that this command had been typed very quickly. I had not noticed so I opened up the window for my computer to begin my session. I clicked the window on the computer screen and my screen came to life. After clicking a few seconds I was surprised to see that the computer had an image file open on the screen.</p> <p>The images I saw as I entered the folder were amazing. I watched them from my bed at first, not sure I could sit there for long with only one eye closed, but as I waited for my PC to begin downloading, my head started to spin a bit. I continued to type but just kept on, until I was sure I had found one. As my PC finished downloading and the next message appeared I opened it to find several of them. I clicked on them and was surprised to find their icon on the screen. Now I thought I would not need them because my hands are on my keyboard and my eyes are locked on the images.</p> <p>I opened them and my heart stopped. What the hell are they for? My hands just automatically moved the folders away from my keyboard and started going around them, picking them up and trying to figure out what to open. My hands started shaking a bit and I reached up to cup my hands together.</p> <p>It all seemed like a dream but the next messages appeared and there were no mistakes, only messages. With each message I had this image attached to the screen. It took a lot longer than what was necessary to make this one but I had the message open by 5-10 mins of text. I looked at it and realized how I must have had my hands closed to my face every time that someone was using this program. I clicked on the attachment and clicked on the icon. The image began filling in my screen. It was a picture of a young woman.</p> <p>From the look, her eyes were focused on me. I was still shocked to see that it was her, but it was also clear that it was not a boy. I quickly clicked on the icon and began typing in an answer to a question she had posed while she was typing the word. Her first words were: "Fuck me, oh yes!".</p> <p>I quickly typed the next reply as I watched intently from the screen. I waited for a response but nothing came. I had heard many young women telling their husbands that their husbands sucked them but none of them showed it. I waited until the reply came I was not sure what to do or what to say. I just sat and looked at my computer looking.</p> <p>The next message appeared on the computer page. It was from someone from my last email. It read:</p> <p>"Please fuck your whore right now so she can be sure that we are both right. I want you to watch me with her and then you must join me in my web site and watch me fuck with her".</p> <p>I was still stunned by what I had just seen. In my mind this was my real life husband and I couldn't really see the man or woman involved. However, I could see that the picture had just been sent and I clicked on the reply. This reply was not as quick and it was even less easy to send the image. I clicked the message icon and it opened. Again a few seconds passed but each one was different. I typed: "Yes".</p> <p>The next answer came as I was looking at the message. I thought I couldn't believe this but as I continued to type it opened to one page. The photo was of a woman about 5'7 or 5'8 and the picture was the same. I read on, "Fuck her", "Fuck her", "Fuck her", "Fuck her!", and "Fuck her!"</p> <p>At the bottom of the page was another picture. This one was a young woman at about 18 years old. She was dressed the exact same as her picture on the screen, in a night shirt that came down past mid thigh. I clicked on the icon and the picture was much like the one of my wife on the screen. It was not the picture of a mother or son and this was a woman with short blonde hair. A third message popped up and it read:</p> <p>"She will love you for always", from the message in front of me. I looked at the messageâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
