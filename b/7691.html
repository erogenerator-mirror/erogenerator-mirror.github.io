"The why's, the why's and the why's I can never fully explain and for now I don't want to make all this sound like a chore."</p> <p>"Because," I smiled, putting the bottle down beside his face on the bed, "of course I don't think that's going to sound very complicated either."</p> <p>"Now let's get this out of the way in one piece," I smirked as I lay down at right angles to his body and got his pants undone.</p> <p>"I think I've covered everything that's really going on, if you could all just agree to help us get it," I said as I started to undress him. "But, all the details I have to work from."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>I could hear the rumble of laughter from his room when he got home early from his job that evening, and when I entered his den I was stunned to see him sitting at the table with a drink in his left hand. He saw my first move, grabbed his laptop from downstairs and quickly left before I saw him pick it up.</p> <p>"Whoa!" he gasped when I entered the living room.</p> <p>"Hi, Tony," I smiled. It was the same look he had at the moment when he walked up to me in his bedroom when he was trying to seduce me. "I'm sorry if I'm making you nervous or offended," I said as I went in, handed him the drink. I sat on a couch where I could watch the football game and he didn't look at me as he sipped it.</p> <p>"I just thought you should know that this is the only way," he said as he finished up on his drink. "It all started about a week ago, so this is your chance to take over on our part of the estate. I know we'll never stay in the city or even come back for a couple of years."</p> <p>"Do you really think that's the best idea ever?" I teased as I got up, sat down next to him.</p> <p>"You have no idea how much I've been waiting for you to do that," he replied as he leaned back into me as I sat on him and started to kiss him. Our hands explored each other's bodies as we ground our hips together.</p> <p>He was feeling me everywhere, down here again as our tongues met and danced with each other. His hands were everywhere on me, stroking the smooth skin as he held me tightly. Our kissing slowed down, and he took a deep breath before he looked up at me.</p> <p>"This is your chance," he said as he looked back down at me. "I really want to make love to you. I don't know why."</p> <p>I was in love again that day. I just hoped that there wouldn't be any more bad dreams I would dream of. I don't know what the hell I meant when I said, "Let's take it upstairs," for one of our bedroom's bedrooms. It seems our bedrooms were the only ones that were not going to be used. He was probably going to need a new one, I'd find out tomorrow.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Chapter 8</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The following events are a result of my imagination created by my husband's imagination. Although the names have not been changed to protect our identities or any of the other persons involved, it will remain a fantasy of mine, and any other fantasy I've created will come trueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
