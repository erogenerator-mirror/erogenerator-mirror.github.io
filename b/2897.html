I'll miss you later," she said before leaving and leaving my room.</p> <p>It was late morning before I was able to sleep. Mom was at work but I had a quick shower to make up for it. I spent half of my time trying to concentrate on my work. I did my best but just couldn't stop looking at Mom, remembering her. The sight of her, the feeling of her bare legs, the smell of her perfume, the softness of her skin. It was so erotic to me but I wasn't able to do anything about it. Mom got home around 12:30. I told her I was going to bed and went to bed myself. I awoke an hour later, still in the middle of the night, feeling a slight tingling in my nether regions. As I opened my eyes I saw Mom in the hall. I went right up to her. My heart was pounding, I was feeling kind of flushed.</p> <p>"Good morning, Mom," came from my mouth.</p> <p>"Morning, Sweetie. Did you sleep good?" she asked, taking a step forward.</p> <p>"I do Mom, but I'm exhausted," I told her.</p> <p>"We'll see about that," she replied as she reached out and took my hand.</p> <p>Mom led me to her room. She closed the door behind us and I fell asleep quickly.</p> <p>I woke as late as I was going to get Mom to shower and brush her teeth. I had to wait for a minute or so before I got out of bed. As I walked down the hallway I was surprised at how much I was looking forward to seeing her shower before we got there. A part of me was hoping Mom hadn't seen me in bed, I'm sure she might have heard me in the shower. It was then that I realized that it really wasn't what it looked like.</p> <p>"C'mon in," I thought, "if they didn't have a hot woman to show me, and I could, well, do more than show you," I said while I followed my sister into her bathroom.</p> <p>Mom took the shower nozzle from the hose holder with the door open only a couple of inches. She closed the door tightly. There was something about the way she seemed so certain of herself and her sexual interest to me. I wasn't able to think of anything else and my mind was racing. What Mom wanted from me was really out of control but what she wanted was a man to love her. I saw she was doing her best to keep it to herself. I knew it wasn't the same thing though. In fact, I think it was a lot more exciting. It's really that simple. Mom was hot, I was attracted to her and maybe I might have been in love with her but it wasn't really love. In some way I felt jealous as hell. I really wanted it to be more than that but it wasn't love.</p> <p>Mom stepped out of the shower. Her face was still flushed and the nipples on her small, firm breasts felt like little erasers being pinched together. She was soaping her body and I wanted to kiss her face, breasts or back.</p> <p>"I had a shower while you slept," I said and I walked toward her, as she started rinsing her body, I reached the bottom of her body between her legs. Her eyes opened wide and she looked straight ahead at the water.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, Dear."</p> <p>"Mom," was the only words my Mom said while she finished moving some shampoo into her hand and started washing herself.</p> <p>"Will you take me for a shave?"</p> <p>"Yes what are you talking about? You can't take that thing off again." To make a long story short I did take it off.</p> <p>"Oh, no, Dear. That's all it is and everything else. I just shave around my legs." She moved to her bed and looked at herself in the mirror again.</p> <p>"Okay," she said as she got up from the bed.</p> <p>"I guess you're right," I replied, "I could never take that thing off. How many people do you think was shaving down there? You're a fine old woman."</p> <p>As my sister and I walked toward her bathroom door I took her in my arms and kissed her, my tongue probing deep into her warm, wet mouth. I felt her hand run through my hair, pulling on my hair. As we kissed, my hands slid over her, running down her soft skin and grabbing her ass as I pulled her tight against me. My lips were so incredibly sensitive to hers and as we kissed I felt her hands slide down my back and grasp a firm ass cheek in each hand.</p> <p>"Come on, Lover, join me in the shower."</p> <p>"Are you really sure that is all you want from now onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
