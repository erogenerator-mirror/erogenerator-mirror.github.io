It's your turn."</p> <p>I took my pants off, and my now erect penis stood out. I could also feel the wetness coming from it.</p> <p>"I see why women don't like to masturbate when they're alone.</p> <p>"Oh!" I moaned.</p> <p>She put her hands under my balls, with one hand, and ran them down my shaft and over my balls. She grabbed me and jerked me with her fingers and ran them down the side to my ass, and I moaned. She looked a little scared as well, and didn't move a muscle. She stroked me a few times, then let go of me and I sat down on the couch. She spread her legs, I leaned down, and started licking her. She didn't taste as good as she smells; I could get used to that.</p> <p>"You're so sweet!" I said in between licks. I looked up at her.</p> <p>"Hmmm. I haven't been with a boy in a long time."</p> <p>"A long time? Your a long time?" I asked, my tongue teasing out and licking her nipples.</p> <p>"Hmmm. I guess so."</p> <p>I worked her breasts in my hands, and could taste the little blood that was coming from them and it was starting to get me ready for some really good pussy.</p> <p>"What should I get you?" I asked, as I moved the fabric over to her stomach and pulled it down over her crotch.</p> <p>"I think you can have all you want now, honey."</p> <p>I moved up her thighs and she spread her legs enough to get me to sit between them on the floor. We were both still wet, but I could feel her pussy lips and her juices. I started by licking around her lips, and I could hear her breathe shallow. It felt nice, especially when I had the chance to lick her clit, and she didn't seem to mind it. I licked and nibbled her lips and moved around her clit a few times, and she started to get wetter and wetter. I moved up, and could see my red dick, and it was sticking straight up. I took it and rubbed it up and down and around her pussy lips.</p> <p>"I want to put it in you."</p> <p>"What? I thought you said you wanted me now."</p> <p>"Mmmmhmm."</p> <p>She took my dick and rubbed it up and down and back, looking at it. All she wanted was the dick inside her. I moved up with her pussy, and I pushed it forward until it was in, but slowly. My dick felt small as it went in.</p> <p>"Oh.Oh."</p> <p>"Mmm. Yeah."</p> <p>My dick was getting thicker, and I could be a little impatient with what was out of the way. I started moving slowly back and forth, pushing it a little at a time. Her lips felt wonderful in my mouth. It wasn't as tight as before, but it had a lot of difference as it got bigger. I reached for her clit.</p> <p>"Oh. Yeah."</p> <p>"Mmm."</p> <p>"Do you like that?" I said, as I played with her clit with my finger as I still pumped my dick.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Are you ready to go yet?" I said in between licks.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. I'm not sure yet."</p> <p>"Then we're in for real." I said as I pushed my dick back in, all the way. It wasn't as big now as before. She was kind of tight, with a little extra around the bottom. Her pussy was a little wetter this time, and I knew there was probably some lubrication there as well. But, she didn't seem to mind. There was another surprise waiting for us in the future (I think)â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
