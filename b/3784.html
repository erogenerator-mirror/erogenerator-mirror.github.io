His head was reeling and he started shaking. He ran into the hallway and into the bathroom. She stood in front of the toilet for a moment. As she looked at him, she felt an immediate, warm tingle in her pussy. Then, she quickly lifted her skirt, lifted her bottom and spread her legs. The water was starting to run, her pussy was soaking. She looked at her body and smiled. "Well, don't just stand there," she said with a grin as she looked at both men.</p> <p>She got in the shower. She put on a pair of underwear and stepped out. She pulled out her makeup and reapplied the lipstick on her full lips. The boys were taking turns kissing her cheeks as she looked at their cocks. She wanted them. She leaned into them as they put their arms around her. She opened her legs and they pressed towards her pussy, forcing their cocks to their stomachs between her legs. They turned to stare at her as she bent forward to pick up their towels.</p> <p>"Here you go," she said smiling. "It might save me a trip to the ladies."</p> <p>"Sure," they said, as they dried themselves off and looked at her naked body.</p> <p>"Honey, have you ever been with another man before?"</p> <p>"Just once, but, no."</p> <p>"Never with a man?"</p> <p>"No, I haven't." She turned and smiled. There was another smile.</p> <p>"Honey, do me a big favor," she said with a sly smile. She turned and bent against the wall next to where everyone had a view of her body. "Would you like to have sex with someone?"</p> <p>They laughed as their eyes feasted on her boobs. "Yes," they said.</p> <p>"Well, it's time to pay the guys your little price," she said, as she moved in close and started rubbing the front side of his swim trunks. She felt his cock growing against her belly, and reached into the top. When it was hard, she pulled it out and stroked it, pulling a large bead of pre cum onto her fingers. He moaned a little as she did so. She put both hands on his cock, pulling it toward her. She leaned forward, putting her boobs in the water, and licked the pre-cum from his cock with her open mouth. She slid her tongue against the head of his cock. He leaned forward and reached around her back, slipping his other hand onto her pussy. He rubbed her clit over and over. He leaned in, kissing her, as his other hand went to the back of her thighs. She didn't object as he kissed her back, pushing his cock further and further into her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, this feels good!" he said as his cock filled her pussy. She started to move with him with each push, and after a few minutes, they were both moaning deeply. She started to moan louder as he thrust forward, pulling almost all of it out before sinking them all back into her. She moved her hands up to his hips, feeling the fullness her clit sent through it to its pleasure center. She pulled him in for more. She rubbed her clit with her fingers, feeling it respond to his thrusts by pushing back. Then she felt it build.</p> <p>"I'm coming!" he said, as his hips started to buck. She felt the warm, wet fluid splash against her asshole. She was sure he came too. He kept thrusting into her and her orgasm had taken over. She lay her head against his shoulder and listened to the sounds of them kissing. He had pulled out and was lying next to her. She lay her head back against his thigh with her hand moving toward her pussy. He hadn't removed the top from her body, and she started to tease his cock with her hand. As her hand moved to his shaft, his fingers found hers at her pussy and he moved her off to the side, placing her against the wall. He rolled her to her back. He took her hands and placed one hand on her pussy. The other hand pushed her legs farther back and opened for him. She spread her legs wide for him, feeling his fingers stroke her pussy and move, searching. She pushed herself back against him, letting him feel the moistness inside. It wasn't long before they were both panting. She pushed herself up, feeling his cock push into her as her legs slid up over his shoulders.</p> <p>They moved to the bed. She sat up, then sat in his lap. She wrapped her legs around his waist, trying to pull more of his cock into her. She knew he could feel the wetness she had in her.
