I asked. "I've got a lot on my mind."</p> <p>"That's just great," she said cheerily, "We need to talk about this." She kissed me and we parted with a hug and a kiss goodbye.</p> <p>The next morning, I got out of the plane at LAX and waited anxiously for my flight to pick up. I didn't get a chance last night before the plane was in the air and flew to Los Angeles where we met up with the other family members. I met Mark and he was with us too. We drove over to the airport to pick up the luggage and then found a quiet spot for the rest of our visit, watching a movie on the big screen television, talking and laughing over the last week.</p> <p>Mark said, "I've got to warn you this will be a hard visit." I laughed as if just thinking about the trip would help me understand his situation. He really is my best friend and I'm pretty sure he knew what I was thinking.</p> <p>It was about ten when the other family members started joining us. It was a nice evening, a good movie of a classic sitcom with some good food and drinks. We even had a good dinner. We were still talking, just enjoying each others laughter and looking out the window. We really could only make out an hour and a half in a movie, the rest of the time we were in a little nap or just making out in the back seat of my car.</p> <p>Finally, the family from out on the freeway said their goodbyes and we all piled into my car and headed home. I didn't know about Mark and Lenny, but I was pretty sure about the other. It was clear that we would make up and be back on the other side of the country, hopefully as long as we didn't have children and I didn't want to change the situation by getting in serious trouble with my ex-fiancée at any point.</p> <p>*</p> <p>thanks for reading this story, I hope this is still of interest to you so if you enjoyed the story tellers just let me know, I would love the feedback—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
