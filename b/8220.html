The heat and friction of the metal against my clit and G-spot brought me closer to an orgasm then I had been waiting for. The vibrations of the shaft, the cool metal of the vibrator and the sight of my breasts swaying with each thrust made me cum so hard my entire body shuddered and tightened.</p> <p>This time, he didn't pull it out. Instead, he pushed it back in. In and out. Long, slow strokes that made my cunt tighten every time, causing me to gasp and groan and writhe.</p> <p>His hand was still on my breast, his hand on my clit, and his other hand busy toying with his cock, but he didn't touch me. He was fucking me with the toys. I could feel the vibration of his cock on his hand inside me each time he plunged it in, and each withdrawal of that big, hot cock.</p> <p>I could hear the slaps and the moans of the two men on a continuous cycle that was beginning to get me close to another orgasm, but never having been with another woman, I didn't know how much longer I could cum from this alone.</p> <p>"Ohh..." I groaned; "Ohhh..."</p> <p>"Oh, fuck..." John sighed. "I'm going to come."</p> <p>The toy continued its hard-on thrusting into me, filling my cunt as deep as it would go, as fast as I could. My hips were bucking violently. I could feel the vibrators deep inside me. My pussy tightened and the dildos began to rotate inside me in different patterns. The motion was not as long, the vibration more intense, as the vibrations from the toy continued.</p> <p>Just as I was about about to come, my legs jerked and I felt the waves of my passion.</p> <p>"OH! OH! OH GOD!"</p> <p>I felt the thick wet head of John's cock jerk and spasm inside me at the last moment as his hot cum coated me. I could feel the contractions inside me ripple and ripple, and I moaned. Not wanting to hurt myself on my own, I moved my hands to the vibrator and tried to push it out again but the stimulation and friction brought me back again.</p> <p>We lay there for a long, long moment, John's hand stroking my side as I stroked his cock as he slowly came down. My hips slowly began to pump his cock. Just the titty fuck on my boob was making me cum again and again.</p> <p>"That was nice..." John said. "Very nice." He smiled at me.</p> <p>He kissed me.</p> <p>"I guess we're done."</p> <p>"Oh, that was just too good..."</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>At the end of Chapter 3, I thought that would be the end of me and John and it was quite for both of us, but that is just the end of it.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed Chapter 3.
