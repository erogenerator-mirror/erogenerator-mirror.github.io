The guys on the team were all guys, they all looked as though they could handle me by myself. They all had a bunch of questions, but seemed to be good at their job and got to the point of the conversation without trying too hard.</p> <p>While we were having our drinks and sipping our drinks, the guys asked if we were girls. It was a nice gesture and we all knew that we were all lesbians and had asked several, but there was much more.</p> <p>I looked at both my friends and they gave me this look that I had never seen before, knowing that they had come as far as to ask. I also didn't know what to do. I asked where we all lived and a man asked me to walk with him so we could look around. Both my girlfriends wanted to go to the same college, but had no car.</p> <p>My friends then asked if we knew of a place for a dance. One of my girlfriends was willing but I told them that it would be all right if they went.</p> <p>They gave me that look again and then walked with the man along and I followed them into the club. I then watched as they walked down the long hallway and into a dark corner. I could hear the music filling the entire place as the man in the corner with me was moving with his partner. By this time, we were both dancing a bit closer to each other. We looked around the room.</p> <p>The guy across from me was looking at me and had a smile on his face and I looked over at him. He too was smiling but I couldn't place it.</p> <p>We started talking and laughing and when we finished, we moved on to more comfortable places. We had some more drinks and left all the guys looking over at us.</p> <p>After one more drink we were all walking around the room naked and there was a little more light shining from the window. All the guys in the room were standing around dancing with my girls and the girls were walking around on the pole so many times.</p> <p>The guys were watching our girls and occasionally rubbing their hands over our bodies. I turned around and looked to see one guys head turn and he smiled. We both knew why but were unsure if it was just a manly feeling.</p> <p>It was getting close to midnight and I had told my friends I was going to go to bed. I was going to go wake my boyfriend up so his girlfriend could go to bed with me. I said that if they wanted me to go to bed, they could call their friends at home and I would sleep with them. They would not mind me being with my friend just as long that it wasn't with me. We both agreed we didn't want to do anything that would not do anything for us but I was excited. I was also hoping to watch my friend fuck another guy.</p> <p>My friend said he would go and join us if we wouldn't mind. I agreed with him and he went and joined his girlfriend.</p> <p>My friend said that she was still going to be on her knees and sucking her boyfriend's cock, just like the boys were going to let her do.</p> <p>With that, they went into the bedroom. My friend turned around and kissed me and said that he and his girlfriends would be right back. My friend looked to my boyfriend and said I should do the same so we could fuck together and that the night was only about us and we didn't have to do anything.</p> <p>My friend looked at my girlfriend and nodded at me to come join them while she went and got ready in the other room.</p> <p>It had been a long time since I had been fucked by a guy and a girl. Even I never thought I would go through with that, but on my way down to the bed, I came to an even more fantastic turn on.</p> <p>On the first night, my boyfriend and I had a long night of sex and it sure felt good to me. We fell asleep just like the night before and woke up a little while later. We were both exhausted and felt as though we had been drinking too much.</p> <p>My girlfriend and my friend got back to bed and I fell to sleep with my girlfriend on the small bed. I think my girlfriend was too tired to get out of bed and go to sleep. After all that sex and the sex with the guys, she was tired and just couldn't go to bed.</p> <p>While I was asleep, I looked at the guy across from me and his girlfriend was there, with her on all fours with her boyfriend between her legs eating her pussy. Her boyfriend seemed to be sleeping between her legs too much to get up. He was still between her legs as well.</p> <p>She started grinding on the guy eating out of her pussy. One of her boyfriendsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
