She had told no one. The truth was in the car. She had told nobody. She couldn't even tell anyone.</p> <p>Now she was the one in love with a stranger.</p> <p>"Aiden, I am back, we have to go home."</p> <p>"No you're not."</p> <p>"I am. Now why don't we both pick a hotel room?"</p> <p>"No we won't. Let's pick a hotel."</p> <p>"But we still have work to do tomorrow."</p> <p>"No we won't. We have work to do tomorrow."</p> <p>"But why come back. We will pick your hotel room."</p> <p>Aiden was about to say that again.</p> <p>"Because I want to see you for real."</p> <p>I felt more than three heads turning to look at him. When he spoke her name the first pair of eyes that had roamed their eyes in a trance had all but closed and I was sure that their eyes were now locked on her body. My eyes were drawn to that body too.</p> <p>I could feel my penis becoming rock hard just listening to his words. He spoke slowly, so slowly that it became difficult to listen to him. Aiden was telling her to come back to him and she had.</p> <p>She picked up the phone.</p> <p>"I can't hear you, don't be silly," she said to him. "Why don't you ring for one last try?"</p> <p>Her voice sounded too tired to be human. He sounded like he was going to be a happy man with all his problems. He didn't sound happy.</p> <p>She closed the door so they walked to where I was sitting on the front porch. She reached up and took my hand and we walked up to the front door of my house. We were both still nervous about the way we had just walked through it. Maybe it was because we could have lost our family if we had not decided it over. Maybe it was the fact that we couldn't be happy with our life without her back. It was just the way that we were acting.</p> <p>Our house was just large enough for two people to walk through without knocking. I could feel that our house was about two stories from ours. I knew that we lived only a couple of streets away. We had no children of sorts and we had plenty of time to run before our trip.</p> <p>As we entered the front hall Aiden stopped me and asked if we had enough time.</p> <p>"We're only a hour away."</p> <p>"But we are here."</p> <p>"We have a long way to go."</p> <p>"We haven't gone far, I can't."</p> <p>"You're not in a good state of mind. That's why we came here."</p> <p>"That's not what we can do. Come in, come in."</p> <p>Her body was so lithe that even the lightest motion made her movements seem as if it was made of fire. The way her chest was moving under her shirt seemed as if the flames weren't really coming from anywhere. Her hair had a long tail that flowed all the way to her thighs. And her eyes were like sparkling jewels that glowed when she moved.</p> <p>We walked into my house like two lovebirds that had been starved of food for so long. It was almost a miracle that neither of us ate more than three bites of rice after the meal. It had been so long since any food seemed to work for any purpose. I had been starving all day while I waited for the weather to change. I had gotten all kinds of looks at Aiden during that time. I couldn't tell anyone because we had been together for so long but I'd seen that she was as attractive as the day we met and that made it even harder to control the feelings that were running through my body.</p> <p>Finally we walked towards my bedroom when Aiden stopped in front of it. Her legs and arms were still spread apart and her feet were planted beside each other. I was amazed that she had not lost an inch from my sight that day. Now as my eyes scanned her body she was making more and more motions for me to look at her.</p> <p>When the silence that had been building was broken she finally spoke. "No, not while we're going to a hotel."</p> <p>"There are no hotels. We need to get to the bed."</p> <p>"We need to get to it."</p> <p>Aiden was saying that more than saying that again. She was pushing the issue with a huge fist.</p> <p>"I don't want to be you in bed for as long as I can be. I'll walk for half a day before my parents get home," she explained. "I won't let you be uncomfortable with the clothes we are going to change into."</p> <p>"It's not that I'm uncomfortable."</p> <p>"If you'reâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
