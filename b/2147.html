The thought of the night, having been so close from the beginning, had her already building up to a massive orgasm. "Oh God, oh god, oh God.... OH GOD YES.....!"</p> <p>"OH GOOOD......!" she yelped, "Oh yes, oh yes, yes!"</p> <p>"GIVE IT TO ME!" she cried. "Pound me....."</p> <p>"Ugghh." she screamed as loud as she dared. "Fuck me....Oh God, my tits....fuck me."</p> <p>She began to feel herself on the edge. "GOD...OH DAMMIT....OH YES....GOOOODDDD."</p> <p>"DO IT!" she yelled into the phone. "DO IT!"</p> <p>She felt the wave rush through her. Like fire. Every fiber of her body seemed to be focused in that spot where ecstasy would be overwhelming. Her eyes flew open, and her mouth hung open in an "oh" as her orgasm crashed into her. She held the phone down against her nipple as she felt the throbbing inside her pulse. Then her body was still, barely aware.</p> <p>In the background Sam was trying to get a hold of herself.</p> <p>"No it's OK." she said. "I don't like to talk to her."</p> <p>"Well, there's no harm in talking to her." said a deep voice.</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"She just really wants you and wants you now."</p> <p>"Oh, well, you can just go home."</p> <p>"Well, we can just finish our coffee."</p> <p>"Okay. Go home."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"So...did you enjoy what happened last night?"</p> <p>"No, I just needed to say it. I'm not sure how I feel about it."</p> <p>"Oh, so you enjoyed it?"</p> <p>"Oh yes. I didn't enjoy it at all."</p> <p>"I just don't want you to be uncomfortable. I want to be the only one knowing just how awesome it is to have your body and mind go to places that you don't like going."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"And we'd better watch that TV or something and get back here before you see how it goes."</p> <p>"Okay. I guess we better go."</p> <p>"You stay and watch and I'll walk you home." he said.</p> <p>"Oh, ok," she said.</p> <p>She took a quick shower and went to bed early and slept wonderfully. She had no regrets about what happened between the two of them. She knew that she would have had to be embarrassed again and would want to go back to the apartment to repeat the night even if no one else noticed. That was the reason that she went to the bathroom after her shower.</p> <p>She slept wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
