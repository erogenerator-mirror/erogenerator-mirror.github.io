I said with a smile.</p> <p>"It's okay, Bill," she said, as we heard the door open.</p> <p>In seconds, there was a man in the doorway, but it was all for me. My wife was still dressed and waiting, and we had a beautiful evening just around the corner. "Would you like to come in?" she asked as we walked through.</p> <p>"Of course!" I said. "Would you like to share? I'd love to give you a nice warm bed, so that we can do all of the things we were talking about earlier. I'll make sure that it's fine with you."</p> <p>We walked in and I took our jackets off, hung it up, and we took a seat on the edge and talked more about the evening. I tried to get her to tell me more about the club, but that just made her nervous and a little embarrassed.</p> <p>We spent a few minutes drinking, and then she took the lead in our conversation. I told her about the evening, especially the strip play where we saw the couple. It seemed strange and exciting at the same time when we talked about their experience. She looked around our table and, seeing that we were talking for the first time, asked, "are your friends coming with us?"</p> <p>"Not really," I replied without raising my eyes, as she quickly sat down.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "Just let me know what you think."</p> <p>I got up and walked the few steps to her and reached out and kissed her on the cheek and then slid my arm around her waist. She leaned into me and I whispered in her ear. "My wife has a really great way of saying that it helps our sex life!"</p> <p>There was a long moment of silence, and I looked at her and smiled. "If my wife wants to say it, then I'll kiss it," she said.</p> <p>We walked to the front of the club and sat down in our chairs, one seat on the edge. I took a sip of my drink, and we chatted for several minutes. After awhile, I suggested the couples, and she agreed, and I got up to get us a couple of drinks while the music started.</p> <p>She sat quietly until the music started, and then turned and faced me. There were no words, just hands, and it was only a couple of minutes and then her hand slid down to my crotch. I sat still for a few seconds, thinking that maybe she was feeling the hardness of my cock, as I was.</p> <p>She got up, took a sip of her drink, then turned to me. "Bill, what are you going to do with me?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," I replied. "I can't really say that I had a choice, but I'm not going to force you to have sex with me either, and I don't think that I would be doing that either."</p> <p>We laughed and the music started, and she said, "It seems that you have a lot in mind."</p> <p>"Oh, I think I will," I said. "I'll even tell you that we'll be wearing dresses, so that's all that we are wearing if the other one isn't wearing it, but I can't tell if they're that way."</p> <p>She smiled again, and said, "And how would you do that?"</p> <p>"I'll show you, if they're that way" I replied. "Just leave them be; I don't want to seem mean to my wife."</p> <p>She leaned forward, and I lifted her chin to look into her eyes.</p> <p>"Would you like to go somewhere else?" I asked.</p> <p>"I guess it might be nice," she responded. "I'm not sure that I want to go to that club with four hard cocks looking for me. It may just be too much for me."</p> <p>"Well, I'm okay with that. I'm not going to force you to do anything that you don't want to, and I'm not really worried about you doing anything for me either," I said. "But I really don't think that I should expect you to be as comfortable as you are, if that's what you want."</p> <p>"Thank you for your trust, Bill," she said. "It means so much to me to know that I can trust you there. I don't really want to think that I've been pressured into doing any of these things, and I think that if it makes you feel good that you could just do that or whatever you want to."</p> <p>"And Bill, I want toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
