"My god. I didn't know what to do. I guess I just wanted you to feel the same way."</p> <p>I pushed open our door and we entered her room. I pulled her into my arms and started kissing her neck. She pushed my arms off of her shoulders, and we fell onto the bed on our sides. She reached around and cupped my pussy and held on. I stroked her back as she caressed my breasts. I leaned toward her and let my lips touch her skin as she kissed her way down my body. When she reached my pussy, she ran her tongue across my lips.</p> <p>We kissed and sucked each other's tongue. I ran my hands between her legs and squeezed her pussy lips through the fabric of the thong. I could feel my heart rate increasing as she continued to lick and suck on my pussy. It was driving me crazy, and my eyes were shut. It felt so wonderful to kiss and touch her like this. I slid back into her and let my body go, moving my pelvis up and down. She took her tongue away from my pussy and took my nipple between her lips. It was so sensitive and she rubbed it back and forth. I was moaning and writhing under her as she nibbled and flicked my nipples.</p> <p>I felt her hips starting to grind into mine and knew it was time to make the most of our moment. I kissed her neck and she kissed down to my neck. She let her tongue run across my collarbone and it sent a jolt straight to my pussy. She slowly moved toward the waistband of the panties and pulled them off. I lifted my hips and let them fall to the bed.</p> <p>She looked up at me with that sexy smile on her face, and slowly slid her fingers up my legs to just above my knees. I felt the touch of her fingers on my pussy lips and spread my lips as she slowly slid them across my pussy. She took each side of my lips and slid her fingertips up and down.</p> <p>"Oh baby, are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes, I am. Put it in you."</p> <p>At those words, my breath hitched in my throat. I wanted to feel this moment with her right here. I wanted to feel everything, I wanted to taste her, hold her, eat her. I wanted to feel her body, feel her breath and hands, taste her.</p> <p>"I'm yours," she said as she kissed me. She pulled away from my pussy, kissed the lips, and ran her tongue up to my clit. "I want you, right now, right here," she said as she let the tip of her tongue touch my hole again and press into me. I spread my legs wider to give her more room for her tongue to stroke my insides.</p> <p>I felt the warm mouth close around my clit, as she swirled her tongue around it, sending electric shivers all the way up my body. I could feel her lips open and start sucking on it, and her tongue moved in and out between her lips. I felt like I was going to explode at any second.</p> <p>The warmth of her mouth on my clit sent me over the edge. I couldn't take it anymore. I needed to feel her touch all of me, and to be held tightly in her arms. She slid her index finger in and out of my pussy and I could feel her finger against my ass. That made me even more excited, and I started humping her mouth. I could feel it getting wetter, making it even wetter. I kept humping her finger, feeling it penetrate me every time I looked down and saw she pushing it in and out of me.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, that's my girl, oh yeah, just like that." I started whimpering and screaming as she stroked her finger deep inside me. I was about to cum, and I had a fever to get through. She knew how much I was going to love her tongue. She pressed her finger against me and slowly increased the pace. I started cumming and she kept it going, moving the finger in and out and licking my clit. I was so hot and wet I think cum was running down her throat as her tongue pushed all the way up inside.</p> <p>Finally she pulled it out and I was breathless. "Honey, I've never ever cum from eating pussy," she said as she gently kissed me. My body was trembling and my knees were weak. "But I want you to feel as good as I feel."</p> <p>She smiled and crawled up my body, straddling my stomach. She took her finger and rubbed it over my lips, letting it run inside of me and then out again. "Mmmmm. There's always next time for that," she said as she kissed my lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
