"I haven't gotten any work done in quite awhile. I need to do some things in the meantime."</p> <p>She was right; I was a bit embarrassed to have her thinking I had a hard-on. It's hard to imagine someone's face looking down while you're sitting there having sex with your own sister.</p> <p>She led me to the bathroom. Apparently, my job is not going to be up to par.</p> <p>There is no problem with this situation, she said as she set about putting the shower on and the water hot. If you're interested?</p> <p>And to be honest, I was. That's why I was standing there like a fool. The water felt good and it felt real when I got up to go for another drink and when I got out and dried my face, (that's what she called it.) I felt the tingle of the water from my face on my cock and for a time the sensation of the tingle had made my penis come alive almost immediately.</p> <p>She was back in a minute or more. She took the showerhead and started the water running. This time, there were more parts of the showerhead to wash. As it came to an end I could see that I had been mistaken. All the water had washed away it's natural effects. So, I was standing there with my back to her in the shower with my hands and just waiting to get out of the shower. It seemed that she was in the bathroom with me. This was a first and I was not going to be a stranger. She was already taking off her clothes. She had on the black bikini panties.</p> <p>"How does it feel to be standing naked out on the porch in front of me?" she asked.</p> <p>"It feels very nice," was all that came out of my mouth. I thought I heard her say a couple of times that she wanted to do more that just to get it out of my mind but I couldn't help getting embarrassed with her reaction. I felt a flutter in my loins at the thought of it but I said nothing.</p> <p>"You sure know how to feel," she said as she moved around where I was standing, leaning against the bathroom wall and holding up the shampoo so that she could get rid of it.</p> <p>"What do you say?" she asked, letting go of the bottle to pick up the shampoo.</p> <p>"Sure," I answered, and then I said she could.</p> <p>She began washing my hair and she got a nice washcloth and washed my scalp. She then had me start on her panties, which she proceeded to do from above, and as I did with the shampoo she washed it all over my body. When she was done with my hair she stood back, got out the soap and had me wash her body, which in turn she did.</p> <p>"So how is it?" she asked.</p> <p>"It feels good," I stammered and she looked over at me and smiled.</p> <p>"Do you think you could do that to me," she said, reaching out to help myself. I reached all the way out towards her and just held onto her as I finished washing her. I hadn't expected to be asked for it at all but even after a moment or two, the touch of her in my arms made me feel more at ease.</p> <p>"This is going to be good," I said in my best girlfriend's voice.</p> <p>"Yeah," I heard her say, "It would be just perfect in here."</p> <p>With her back to me, she reached right down between her legs and began stroking her pussy. It was warm and wet as I thought my dick would be as hard as wood and she didn't seem to notice or care that I had become erect.</p> <p>And so did she as she reached out to grasp my cock.</p> <p>"Is this going to be a special night for me and the rest of us?" she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"It's just going to be my first time with a girl," I told her, as if saying it could be wrong but I hadn't thought it far.</p> <p>"Yeah, you can have the pleasure of making love to me later," she said, "but right now I just have been waiting for this for a week." It was true. She was going to have her first date with me. That's when I thought, "If he is good to me, then I might just as well take him with me." It had happened before. But I was not thinking of anything now. I was looking for more ways to make her get laid. I just hadn't the heart to do it. She reached up and began to stroke my cock and as she did, her lips parted slightlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
