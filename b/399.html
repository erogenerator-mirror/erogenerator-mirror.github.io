He was in his 40's or 50's. I couldn't read his face any better but it gave him an air of authority. He had short brown hair, browned eye liner, and a thick goatee. He was about 5'10" and just barely 100 lbs. He had a very wide forehead.</p> <p>He was completely bald on the top. He shook a hand out of his gloves and said, "I didn't order for this weekend. I could have gotten you one or two more shirts but we are closing."</p> <p>He went over to the door and looked back at me, giving me the go ahead sign. After closing the door he leaned back as he looked around. He started talking to the store owner while I went to change.</p> <p>"You might want to be out of here before you embarrass yourself." he said. He was staring intently at my feet and had those big grins on his face. I could tell he was looking at my feet.</p> <p>"You can stay a while. I promise you'll enjoy this weekend before too much longer," he said to me.</p> <p>I walked out to change. I had to run up the stairs to the room that I'd shared with my husband for a while before I left the store and went to the bedroom to change. My husband and I went to bed the next night and he did not make love to me, he had me lay on the bed and he fucked me. My husband fucked me.</p> <p>The next morning the shop owner was in the kitchen fixing breakfast. He looked at me and said, "Well, let's have a little fun and then I'll leave the place and take you to your car."</p> <p>"That's a great suggestion, sir," I said. "Will you be around for a few more after the weekend?"</p> <p>"I'll definitely keep you around during the week and I'll let your boss know you're buying the store. I'll keep you around, sir."</p> <p>"Okay. If you do like the place, I'll call you tomorrow."</p> <p>He went off and I went out to my car and sat down in the car and he started driving off. I started a conversation about the rest of the weekend but left it open on him just enough to let us know we should have been having sex on the side in the parking lot when we were going.</p> <p>I parked my car and walked into the shop. The man behind the counter was about 50# or so. He had that big smile and the same eyes as my husband. He gave me the go ahead sign and told me he was sure we'd enjoy the weekend. He had a small black plastic bag on the counter next to a stack of shirts. He took my hand and I went out into the back of the store. He said he'd buy the shirt and I told him it could be mine if he wanted it.</p> <p>He went around the room to my door. When he'd come around in front of me he said, "Let me buy you one."</p> <p>"Why don't you come up to my room," I said. "I'll have a towel and you can change before you change."</p> <p>I went up to our room. I could hear the door open behind me. When I turned around he was looking at my naked body.</p> <p>"You're the hottest naked woman on the planet, you know that?" he said.</p> <p>"Thank you. I'm in the shower right now so I can wash the day's tan. I hope you like what you see." I replied.</p> <p>"I love it. Thank you for the shirt and I'll let you decide when you're finished. Are there any other things I can have you change?"</p> <p>"No. I think I'm doing a nice job of washing myself all over this morning. Maybe later on we can hang out in our swimwear and I can show you my new bathing suit. That sounds like a wonderful idea." I could feel my pussy beginning to get wet.</p> <p>"Do you think I should join you in the shower when I come out?" he asked while I pulled a towel from the closet in our guest room. He handed it to me and then he walked out toward the front of the shop while I turned the lights down. I had a big smile on my face as I watched him walk over to his desk and pick up the rack of shirts.</p> <p>"Are you going to let me wash your shirt?" I asked as he got the rack of shirts up to my shoulder length blond hair. He turned the lights and pulled the rack out. He walked over to the bathroom door and turned on the light. He stepped into the shower and I took hold of his towel. I pulled it off and stepped into the showerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
