I'm sure we'll have to wait for all the people we leave here in the morning. I only have one, because I'm working on one for my office."</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>The waiter was back to his task with a smile of approval.</p> <p>A small part of the crowd that I'd never been able to see was now disappearing, and the place was getting busy, as people began filing in. It was obvious that none of the crowd would see my dress at all, so the restaurant was really only a part of the downtown area of the city.</p> <p>I was starting to feel a little nervous now, but when I heard voices on the street outside the hotel, I realized for the first time that the place was actually full. I could only guess who the other occupants of the restaurant were, and as they began to leave the restaurant when I finally saw them, the crowd faded out as though it had never happened.</p> <p>As I stood in front of the full-length cathedral, all I could see was a single image, clearly one of those pictures of the two women dancing on the dance floor. It had been very, very long, and the image seemed to turn in my mind, like a very, very erotic film.</p> <p>I was also sure that someone might be looking over my shoulder, and I suddenly had the feeling that I was staring directly into my own heart.</p> <p>"Oh, God, oh, God," I whispered in disbelief as I heard him shout.</p> <p>I was so nervous that I felt like I'd peed my pants, and he was staring right at me as he made an announcement.</p> <p>"I really didn't see you," he said into my hair, as he pulled my hair back off my neck, "I was just leaving the hotel."</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt my body tense in shock.</p> <p>"You were dancing in the hotel," he added, trying to calm me, "I saw you."</p> <p>I looked around, noticing that people were still moving toward the hotel on the street, which could only mean that they had noticed me as well. There seemed to be an awful lot of people, and my body, and even my soul, felt like it might explode.</p> <p>"Oh, God, you're a hottie!" I heard Jake say, and I saw the color drain from his face in his eyes.</p> <p>He moved my hair to the side and quickly took my hand. I looked up at him, and found that I liked this stranger. His face was almost as cute as he was beautiful; there seemed to be a way the hair would go past his eyes, so that it would seem like he was being all of a man, his face and neck alluring from the light in the room, like a snake.</p> <p>He turned back to me, and saw that there was a smile on my face; he moved his way over to one of the bar tables, and sat down; he leaned closer to me to whisper in my ear, "And you," and I felt that I had no power, but in a way, he had power over me.</p> <p>I felt so humiliated to have him see me as some kind of hottie, and he seemed to like it that way; he looked at me as if he was appraising me, and as I glanced over at him, I saw that I was a hottie to him. I felt like a school girl at one of her proms again, but at the same time felt as if for the first time, he was appraising me.</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed me on the cheek, and said, "I'll be right back."</p> <p>Once he left, I looked again at the beautiful stranger before me, and found that he'd had quite a bit of success talking me into coming to the hotel. He seemed to be enjoying himself, he was giving me the impression that he was looking forward to the adventure of being "one of the many women in the room."</p> <p>I couldn't keep my mind on anything else, other than the intense arousal between my legs, and then after a couple of minutes I began to get excited. He was definitely turning me on, and the way he was looking at me as if he were sizing me up, as if he were sizing up everything I'd got to my age, and I hadn't yet been properly measured for his age.</p> <p>"You must have had a good time at the club tonight," he said to me as he turned toward the door, "I hope you enjoyed your time here."</p> <p>I couldn't even reply. What was he thinking? That I liked it here, and that he liked me? I wasn't sure I liked him, and I began toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
