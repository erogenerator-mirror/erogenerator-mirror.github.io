Do you feel all right, you know, like we were just fucking in the bathroom?" She blushed fiercely, and I saw her cheeks getting redder as she asked this question. I just kept stroking her body with my arm, and she kept quiet. It was obvious that this was what the older lady had to do.</p> <p>"Can we go now? We can use my cell this time, you have my voicemail." I said with a smile, and she looked relieved. But, at the last second I pulled my arm away and she began to struggle. "It's ok, you can trust me."</p> <p>"That's my girl," I said, and I held her tightly. "Relax, I won't hurt you. We can fix this, at least not before they show up." I leaned down to kiss her again, and kissed her hard. She returned my kiss passionately, and then let me pull her to a standing position. "What is your place? Where's your cell, can I call you when?"</p> <p>"We can't go outside, at least no more than right now," I told her, and she nodded and hugged me again. She ran her hands through my hair and moaned as I squeezed her ass, and kissed her mouth.</p> <p>She grabbed her cell from her purse as she led me to the lobby and I quickly locked up the car and ran out to the car. She had already gotten my jacket and was pulling off her sweat pants. "Here, this'll do nicely, huh?" I nodded, and she stepped into my embrace.</p> <p>She had a small cock that she was stroking. "Can I kiss it?" I smiled, knowing it was going to be a surprise. Her cheeks were flushed and her mouth was slightly open and slightly moist. She looked at me with that expectant look. I put my hands under her ass, and pulled her into me, and gave a soft kiss for her, pressing my pelvis against hers. I was surprised at how turned on in my own skin I felt, but at the same time, I was a little relieved. She started to run her hands over my chest and arms, and I moved my hands up to cup her breasts. "This should help some things. " I cooed as I caressed her in time with the kiss.</p> <p>"No..." She breathed out as I moved one hand up to her neck and gently drew her down to kiss her again. I broke the kiss this time, and stepped out of the car. "Here's what I want to do..." I put a finger on her lips again. "Let me help you with something else, though."</p> <p>"You're so sweet," I said, pulling her close as I led her outside. The parking lot was only a few hundred metres away. I got her key into the door, unlocked it and let her inside. She was standing in the middle of the parking lot again, and I quickly took the opportunity to unzip her suit jacket and get them off of her. I could tell that she didn't have as much of a breast as she had before, but I was amazed that she didn't have a bra on under it. "Here, let me just get these off, and then we can get started."</p> <p>"Now, hold on one more," I said, and I got her shoes off on her feet. She stepped out of them, and I put the suit she was wearing under her coat, which she had loosened up after getting home early. I pulled her to me and kissed her deep, but we both stopped to kiss around the outside of her lips. She was obviously enjoying this. I stepped back and grabbed her hips as she stepped out of them, and then slid it down. I loved watching her smooth skin with only her little black lace panties on. She had nice sized breasts and, in my opinion, they weren't too bad. Her nipples were small, too, probably because of her bra, and I could see the outline of some freckles that had stuck a few months ago, and it was definitely noticeable when they went up and out.</p> <p>I stood back away from her, watching her as she took her time picking her way around the parking lot, and I just grinned. It showed no signs of going down the stairs, and she was obviously enjoying herself. After about twenty seconds I took my finger and wiped it along her stomach and down the outside of her leg, then held her close to me again and whispered into her ear, "Don't say anything."</p> <p>She looked disappointed at my teasing, but quickly returned to where I was standing. She was looking around the parking lot, and I took advantage of it and placed my hand on her left hipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
