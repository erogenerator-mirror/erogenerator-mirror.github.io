The collar pulled tight across his shoulders. A large bruise was showing on his upper left cheek. His white beard was inked all over his face. He had that kind of look that always came over him at times when someone hurt him physically. It didn't matter, but when she was near him, he'd be reminded again.</p> <p>When she was near him, his eyes would be the hardest to look at. Even when she was at home with him, they were often as bright as his eyes. Sometimes, he'd see himself staring into her eyes and think to himself,</p> <p>"I'm going to take that shirt off, I'll take that shirt off."</p> <p>One thing he never said to her as she'd walked out the door, ever, was never again, "But aren't you going to take it off?" But if he'd taken it off first, he'd have stopped and thought about the pain and bruises on her body, and he definitely hadn't.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>She wanted to reach out and hug him?</p> <p>"Sure." He'd run his hands down her backside. He'd cup her bottom cheeks, squeeze them between his fingers. Those soft globes were heaven. He'd always been proud of them. Her skin was rich and taut. But her cheeks always seemed bruised when he took them away, and on those days, they were a bit swollen.</p> <p>"So, will you take it off?"</p> <p>"Well...I mean, I wouldn't mind, I mean, if you're sure, okay?"</p> <p>"I'm gonna have to leave it on, so I won't feel bad. What about you?"</p> <p>She felt bad thinking of him naked with her shirt off. She saw herself in a mirror the night she tried to get him into bed. He'd tried to give and take what she gave him, but that was a new kind of pleasure for her. She felt better when he tried. He'd given her to those other girls in school, and they'd never thought they were good enough. If she'd have done anything to hurt that guy anyway, she'd have taken it easy, but he didn't try, and anyway, he'd never done a thing for her.</p> <p>She smiled and pulled the shirt off. She watched herself in it and admired the way the lacey little bra she was wearing outlined her cleavage nicely.</p> <p>Her eyes never left the sight of herself in the mirror. She'd always felt that he was staring. She'd told him, "I'm a bit of an exhibitionist." But he'd never really looked, never really noticed.</p> <p>It had been years, since she'd last gotten fucked, and it had been like her sex life hadn't been that long. Her life, she'd been doing all the other things her parents told her, and now, it was one of those things?</p> <p>"Do you wanna go on a date with me tonight?"</p> <p>That hadn't been necessary. She wanted him to know that, like everyone else, there was a chance for a little adventure when he'd get home from work on Friday. She decided against it. That night was too important, not to the future. She didn't let her mind wander back to school, and her grades were never good. But they were important to her, wasn't they? She still couldn't shake the fact that he was going to make love to her again. After all they'd had in a long time, not as a girlfriend, but to lovers. No, she had to tell him, he was hers, and that would have to wait while he got over his shyness.</p> <p>"Well, um, sorry about that."</p> <p>It was all she could offer him. He was her new boyfriend, and she, had a bad day. "Don't worry, I'll take good care of this one." She winked at him, as she dropped on her hands and knees in the dirt.</p> <p>He watched her as she crawled across the sand. He was glad they had enough food down on the ground to have a decent meal now. He was going to eat that.</p> <p>"But how have we got here anyways? Are you sure you're not just going to ask me that?"</p> <p>As usual, that was just the answer he came across. She had the body of a queen. He saw now where the night's passion had gone. He watched her hands stroke as she crawled across the water. Her hair fanned out around her like a sheet. His stomach did it's thing.</p> <p>She never stopped, never stopped. He was looking at her, his eyes full of animalistic lust. He never stopped touching her as she crawled across the beach.
