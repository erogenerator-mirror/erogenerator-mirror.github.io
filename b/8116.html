Maybe I'll call you tomorrow?"</p> <p>"I can't,"</p> <p>Oh God, I thought, this is how it's going to go, it's going to go to far. That's what she did, what she said, this was all her doing for a joke, she was actually doing it. The thought of it was making me crazy. I could see it in my minds eye that I had to have her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No, no, now don't say it," she started laughing, "Don't worry; I'll make sure everything is clean. I got some things I need to do, can you help me?"</p> <p>This was her plan, I was going to see what if she came back with all that stuff, and I decided to stop myself from giving her a chance to stop her plan. That way I wouldn't have to think about it, and she would know I had stopped. She was still smiling in it, just as I was, and then she had a look on her face which I had never seen before. I guess all those times I had said I loved her and when she had said I loved her, she had meant it. She stood there with a sad look on her face while I just sat there with my heart beating so loud that it was really starting to ache inside my pants. She looked like a child in the eyes, and she looked so happy.</p> <p>"It's all right, you just have to take it easy," she said. "It'll be better now,"</p> <p>"I can't wait that long, can you give me some time to finish it?"</p> <p>"No, I need to have some time in the morning," she said, turning back to go get more clothes. I couldn't believe what she was suggesting to me. I couldn't. I couldn't even find the courage to ask her again. What the hell had happened?</p> <p>"Can you give me more time, I'll give you all the time," I said.</p> <p>"Thanks, but I can't. No, I promise, it's just so strange," she said.</p> <p>"No, please don't go," I said, trying to put a brave face on it. And it didn't help. She did that thing, what kind of a weirdo is I. That's what it is. She was the one who was just making me do this.</p> <p>"Please?" she asked, and that's all I could think of. But when I did, she was so happy that I felt like I owed her something.</p> <p>"I promise it," I said to her.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said, then she kissed me, "I've missed you," she said, "I know you're busy."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, and I looked at her face where I realized that she was looking at me. I looked at my watch, time went by. "Let's get back home," I said to her.</p> <p>We walked back to the bedroom and she began kissing me as we were in the shower. She felt so good, I could have just taken her right then and there and I would have stopped her. But instead I just watched as she looked back up at me with a sad expression. What could I do? I kissed her, and my tongue darted in and out of her mouth. We were both moaning, and suddenly she took me in her arms, holding me. I couldn't move, she was all over me, and I didn't have any more to do to hold her in my arms. As she held me, I could feel my heart beating wildly in my chest, she kissed back, and I felt the love flowing through me. I was in heaven, not knowing what the hell was going on, then I felt my hand being taken from my body and replaced with hers. I was the one who had just fallen, taken, and given into the unknown. I opened my eyes and saw that she was holding me. I took her in my arms and we kissed, then we were being taken off somewhere by our hands. When we got up, we looked at the time on the wall, and I didn't know what to do, she started kissing me, then I did it, but all I wanted was to be in her as close to her as we could be, kissing her while I still held on to her.</p> <p>I wasn't so sure I could do something like thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
