I said. Before she could say anything, I slapped her across the face with my open hand.</p> <p>"Ouch. Stop." She said. She was having trouble standing in my living room. "It is just not comfortable for you to sit on my lap."</p> <p>I was trying to think of something to say. Why was this happening? It was my house after all. She could ask for an apology from me but I could not accept. I wanted her to see that I would do everything to protect her.</p> <p>"I am going to put a coat on. That is all." She said while turning and walking into my bedroom to pull the long coat off.</p> <p>I grabbed it from her and she tried to take it off. I pulled on the straps that held it all in place. Her hands went to them.</p> <p>"No... Don't." I said. "We don't need it. I own it. But I don't want you to go back to standing in my living room."</p> <p>She started to protest but I slapped her hands away.</p> <p>"Go sit on the couch." I said. "Just relax for a second."</p> <p>I sat down and walked to the side of the couch where she sat. I handed her the coat off me and gave her a kiss.</p> <p>"I do have to tell you my mother used to hang out at the house with me." I said. "She gave me a tour around the house."</p> <p>"She also used to spend all her nights at the house with my grandmother." I said. "I think you should have your bed turned into a guest room."</p> <p>"But of course, it is more comfortable than the couch." She said.</p> <p>"Yes but there is always my bed." I said. "But if a guest uses the guest room, it is just a guest room. We would need more space. The only thing I want to do is to do what the guest uses the master bedroom."</p> <p>"I understand." She said. "And yes, I might have slept on the couch, if I were a guest."</p> <p>"I don't care." I said. "What I want is a guest, with me. And now that the guest, if she wants it, she would have to sleep in the big bed."</p> <p>"You are joking?" she laughed. "But you are right."</p> <p>"You don't see what I am talking about." I laughed. "I own all the common areas of the guestroom that have to be in the master bedroom."</p> <p>She started to protest again but I caught some of her defiance before she did so. That was the main reason I wanted to keep the guest bedroom.</p> <p>"Then don't complain anymore, please." She said.</p> <p>"I am not complaining now." I said. "I need to say something to you right now. Are you okay?"</p> <p>"I... No, not at all." She said.</p> <p>"Good, because I have everything I need right now to get to work. I also want to talk to you about tonight." I said. "Do you think you could come with me and go sit on your bed for a while?"</p> <p>"I will try." She said.</p> <p>"Oh, it is important if you are coming with me right now." I said.</p> <p>"Okay." She said. I sat down on my living room sofa and sat down beside her. I leaned across her and wrapped my arms around her.</p> <p>"You will need this for a while." I said. "If you are ever cold, don't be cold."</p> <p>"I will try not to be cold." She said. A few tears ran down her cheeks. I leaned over and held one in my left hand.</p> <p>"You are right that I already know that you are cold but if you get cold, do not try to comfort yourself. If you are really cold, just say sorry." I said.</p> <p>"I am sorry." she whispered.</p> <p>"You need to know that you are welcome to come with me anytime." I said. "When you come from here, just call and let me know."</p> <p>"Thank you. I will do that. I really have to get going." She said.</p> <p>"Oh no. Your going to spend a lot of time there." I said. "If you can't handle the cold and the tears, I want you to come back tomorrow."</p> <p>"Okay." She said.</p> <p>I pulled her into me and kissed her. I rubbed the side of her face with my hand. "You are going to have a lot to live with on this trip. We just have to get to know each other. Now let's get out of here soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
