He pressed his hand down to her pelvis on her pubis. Her body squirmed as it responded with an agonised quiver, her breath caught as it continued to moan. He lowered his head to her neck, kissing as his lips and teeth caressed her flesh. He felt his own body shudder as she came under his, his tongue dancing as he kissed and licked her neck, tasting her skin as it warmed his own.</p> <p>She shuddered and bucked beneath him, and her hands fisted together to hold his head more fully against her. She held on to his head tightly, and her grip on him seemed to become painful when his fingers slid deeper inside her.</p> <p>When he slid his fingers out from under her and she felt the air being taken from her, she looked over at him with panic in her eyes.</p> <p>"What am I, Aiden?" she asked as she held him tight to her.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," he said softly as his head lowered to nuzzle against her neck.</p> <p>"Hm. I didn't mean..." she murmured, then broke off looking at him. "I'll always be beautiful in my eyes..."</p> <p>He kissed her gently for a while, just to reassure her as she gazed up at him with tears forming in her eyes. But then he felt the tug of her hand under his chin, and her fingers curled around his neck. He nodded gently.</p> <p>"And, Aiden, you're beautiful too," he murmured, his hand dropping to his side. "I love you."</p> <p>She leaned forward so that her lips covered the side of his nose and they stayed there, her tongue lolling across his lips as she gazed down into his eyes. She saw his expression and licked her lips, feeling her own lips quivering in pleasure at her touch. This was how he always knew she was beautiful. He wanted to hear her praise him. The thought made her whole body tingle, and her heart beat.</p> <p>"Kiss me again," she whispered. To her surprise, he didn't stop her, but he pressed his lips against hers with the same intensity she saw before.</p> <p>Aiden was still a little shy about kissing another human, but since his sister never allowed him to even see her, he felt more confident. This was a whole new experience for him, to know people who weren't even half way, and he felt more certain of himself. As the kiss ended, Aiden watched as she looked so content before, and he realized there would be days of that, too. Then he turned and looked at her. She was still blushing, and they were kissing, not just the lips, but the whole body. Aiden had never known anything like what his sister would do. The kiss was intense. It seemed all over for her, the way her hands were pressing down on his as he pressed himself against her, the way her hand gently caressed his face as he pressed against her was exquisite. He could almost feel her heart beating against his own, and his own heart was beating too, but it seemed she didn't mind.</p> <p>They both broke apart, and he turned to look at her as his hands ran along her sides. "Are you going to kiss me again?" she asked.</p> <p>He shook his head, and she smiled. "We can do this the old fashioned way if you want to." Aiden nodded, and then he watched as she stood up and walked over to her bed.</p> <p>"Hang on," he murmured and turned to look down at her.</p> <p>When he looked back up again, she was sitting up on her bed, and she smiled at him. He couldn't help but smile back, and then he was leaning down to kiss her again.</p> <p>The kiss began as they had at night in every other way. Their tongues danced, the taste of her skin was salty and earthy, and their bodies pressed together in the heat of their passion. The feel of his skin against hers, her soft and warm hands touching his body as they kissed, was something that he longed for. His eyes closed as her touch was so soft.</p> <p>Her body felt so firm beneath his, as he continued to watch her. His fingers fidgeting where they brushed over her skin, then, finally, he reached out and gently cupped her breast in his hand.</p> <p>She shivered and moaned as his fingers made contact between her breasts. Aiden let his fingers drift lower again, his fingers gently cupping and squeezing her flesh. He closed his eyes as she moaned and writhed beneath him, and he felt his own body react to her movement.</p> <p>If thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
