His hand was still over hers as the kiss broke, and she turned her hand to him and pressed her fingers to his lips as they moved closer to the window.</p> <p>"Thank you sweetie," she whispered softly as they turned to open a cab door. "We'll go straight to your house."</p> <p>She watched as the driver's door opened and turned and walked away. She felt his hands slide around her waist as he stepped aside for her to pass the driver for the cab. He was still breathing heavily as she closed the door and stepped out, still breathing harder as she walked toward the front door of his house, taking the keys with her.</p> <p>Once inside the house, she followed the driver, turning and closing the door behind them as they climbed up the stairs to the third floor. Once inside, she kicked off her shoes and started unbuttoning her blouse as the man took a step back and watched her silently. "That's one fine woman you've got there, sweetheart," he said to her, his lips moving closer to hers, then she felt his arms come around her, pulling her back to him and resting his hands on her shoulders. His lips were against hers, and she could taste his breath, too. She wrapped her arms around his neck in return, pressing her body against him as she kissed him slowly, then more forcefully, her breasts against his hard, muscular chest.</p> <p>A soft moan escaped her lips as she pushed herself against him, his large hands cupping her breasts as he kissed her. A thrill ran through her as his hands rubbed over her body, slowly moving to unhook her bra, then sliding it off her shoulders as he slowly slid it up to her shoulders. She didn't have to tell him to remove it, as he did. Her large breasts spilled against his chest, and he began to rub the bra over them as his mouth went back and forth across her hard pink nipples, sucking them into his mouth.</p> <p>Her skin was so soft, her back was slightly curved as his hands cupped her ass, lifting her to him as he bent his knees, pushing her up against the wall from behind. She closed her eyes as he kissed her as his hands kneaded her soft flesh, and when he finally broke the kiss to look at her, she had tears in her eyes.</p> <p>There was a small smile on his face as he reached down to cup one of her breasts, feeling the nipple harden. Her stomach tensed as he did so, and he let his tongue tease it before moving to her neck. She could feel his tongue moving down as he unbuttoned her blouse, then pulled it apart. When she opened her eyes to see him in front of her, she saw his expression as he took in her body, but not the lust that went with it. She took his hands and placed them on her breasts, and heard him moan at the size of them and how he kneaded them gently.</p> <p>She felt his other hand caress her face as he kissed her softly again, and she could feel his hands moving down to her backside. Her body shivered as his fingers played over her, his fingers moving upward to cup the small of her back, then lifting his hands to slowly move to the small of her stomach.</p> <p>She wanted to tell him again how incredibly she was feeling about him, but that would be admitting that part of her was in love with him, but she also knew how much she loved him too. He had taken her, and that was enough, she told herself. He was not perfect, and she wasn't perfect. But, she just knew that she was feeling exactly the same way that she felt about him.</p> <p>As the door opened and they moved inside, they turned to look at the living room. It had a large, ornately decorated fireplace, and a lovely little black and white rug down right in the middle. The sofa was comfortable to sit, and was a size size taller than the couch, but was at least a foot taller than the coffee table they shared. They both looked around the room, and she saw a fireplace in one corner, the fireplace in the other.</p> <p>"I want to take a shower," he said softly as they turned and walked over toward the bathroom. When they got to the bathroom, he closed the door softly, knowing that he wouldn't be able to leave after the shower had finished. She followed him into the bathroom, where she started the shower, and they both stood for a moment in the shower.</p> <p>They kissed on the cheek as the water streamed over them, as his hands stroked over her body, his fingers making light circles on her nipples, feeling them harden under his touchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
