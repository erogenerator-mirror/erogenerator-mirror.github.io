Her hands moved toward his face. He smiled, kissed her, stroked the side of her face while she kissed him back. He felt her hand slowly move toward his cock. She was right, of course. He was going to be on display in his best swimsuit in his life. She could see him starting to nod in agreement. "Well, come on," she giggled, "Time to change the sheets."</p> <p>They turned and ran toward the hallway. He closed his eyes and she reached down and grabbed the bottom of his swimsuit and, with one smooth hand, flipped it up, while she grabbed his dick. He looked down, watching as she jerked him in her soft hands. Her thumb and index finger pressed on the head, then she rubbed it against her cheeks like she did with Mikey. "Come on," she said softly, her voice a little scratchy. He looked up at her. "This is all you," she said, still jerking him. "Come to me." She looked back over her shoulder. "I think we'll stop," she said as she slowly backed out of the bathroom.</p> <p>Dee quickly changed into her swimsuit. It was a little snugger, but still a little skimpy. Her butt was big and round, the bottoms of her cheeks hanging lower. Dee held two wet towels in each of her hands, "Wear the wet one," she said. He hesitated about ten seconds before he did as she asked, "I thought we were going to stop," she said, as she handed him the towels, "this will do for now." He took each one, wrapped the towel around his waist and they headed to her. As they neared her bedroom, Dee took off her clothes and got into bed.</p> <p>As they lay in bed, Dee leaned back and said, "You're a lucky man." He was already looking at her, "I should leave," he protested. "Just because I'm a little on the skinny side." She smiled at her own little joke. She kissed him softly. "Come to me," she said. He rolled towards her. He kissed her again as she spread her legs for him. At that moment, she felt him rubbing the head of his cock along the sides of her pussy lips. She rubbed the head of his cock along her lips again, feeling them part. He teased the end of his cock with the end of his, then pushed it along the inside of her lips, feeling the wetness. She groaned in pleasure as she felt it slide past her lips and slowly slid into her.</p> <p>"I bet you didn't think we stopped," he teased, "that we wouldn't do this, did you?"</p> <p>"Oh god," she replied, "I thought...this was going to be so much more than it is."</p> <p>Dee pushed into her and felt his cock sliding slowly into her, "Tell me you're ready."</p> <p>"I'm all ready," she said, pulling him toward her. She felt the pressure of his body against hers and she felt him slide deep inside her.</p> <p>She pushed her hips up to meet him, pulling away just slightly. "It won't stop now," she said, "you're going to have to push, push, push." She felt his weight pressing against her, as he fucked her. A sudden jerk and she felt the weight press back, his cock sliding in and out of her with each stroke. "Oh god, what have I done?" she thought. She squeezed her muscles as she started to move on top of him, trying to bring each stroke deep inside her.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt his cock jerk and spasm inside her. "Oh god," she said softly, grinding her hips hard against his. His cum was thick and sticky against her lips and her clit. He had been deep inside her. She felt his hands on her belly. She could feel the softness of his hands there, but there were other areas that were different. She felt his cock slide out of her as he rolled off of her onto his back. She felt him pull her up and roll her on top of him. He was lying on his back with his arm draped around her waist. She smiled down at him as he kissed her lightly. "I think I've made your choice," she said. Dee reached down and grabbed her swimsuit. She had it in her hands with the towel between them.</p> <p>"No," he said, as he pulled her body near his. "You stay."</p> <p>She smiled, "I guess that makes it all the more fun."</p> <p>"No," he said, "I don't want to leave." She smiled at him. "I want to stay," she replied, moving between him.
