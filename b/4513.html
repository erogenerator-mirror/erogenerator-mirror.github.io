I nodded and she sucked hard on one of my nipples. "Say my name again," she demanded. I nodded again and she slipped her tongue back into my pussy.</p> <p>She sucked me dry of all those delicious juices and then I felt it once again. I opened the condom and slid it out. She stood up next to me and put it on. "How many?" she asked. I said ten. She smiled at me.</p> <p>I could feel a little trickle of warm come running down my leg as she stood there. "Six," I said, and she put her fingers to my lips. "All yours, big boy."</p> <p>She stepped toward me and I felt one of her hands grab the back of my head to guide me between her legs. She was so tight! And, she smelled so good! "I hope this is a first for you, sweetie," She cooed as she slid me into her. I was still rock hard all right, but I was surprised by how easily it slid into her. "Well?" she asked, again. "Are you sure?" she asked as she rocked her hips slowly back and forth. "Don't think you're ever going to be a boy," she teased, "because you'll be a woman."</p> <p>"I think you're right," I replied, as she began a steady, rhythmic motion. "I'm just so hot!"</p> <p>"This is why I wanted the condoms to go with this outfit, too," she suggested. I took a big swallow of my beer and handed the bottle to her, who took it without protest. "You're going to want this to work," she insisted and then she grabbed my hand and led me into the bedroom. My jaw was practically hanging open as I followed her the entire way. As we got to the bedroom, I noticed a large box at the foot of the bed. I took it out and saw that the top was a little more roomy than the other bedroom except for a queen size bed. "It looks even bigger," I said.</p> <p>"I know," she smirked. She pushed me down onto the bed and then lay on top of me, pushing me into the bed with her knees and spreading my thighs apart. "Now, let's give this little piece of meat a really long ride!" She said as she slid her cunt up and down over me. "Do you have another one on?" she asked. "Uh huh,"I replied.</p> <p>"I like to eat," she said, sliding her lips down to the base of my shaft and swirling her tongue around the sensitive part right underneath my cock head. "Do you like this?" she asked. "That's just a little tongue action," she said as she ran her tongue over me again and again. "Tell me, sweetie, do you think you're ready?"</p> <p>"Uh, I think I'm ready, but, I don't know. I've never..." I stammered, "I've never...."</p> <p>"I thought I told you," she said and took my penis in her other hand and stroked up and down with her thumb as she licked and sucked me. "Tell me," was all she said as she sucked me in and kept stroking me. "Say 'I'm ready'. Tell me what you want me to do to you!"</p> <p>"I want you to eat me!" I answered as she pulled her lips back and kissed me, her tongue moving rapidly over mine. "I want to feel you inside me, please," I begged.</p> <p>She pulled off of me and climbed onto the bed. "On your hands and knees," she said. She moved between my legs and slid the tip of my erection slowly into her wet opening. She looked at me as her eyes were focused on my own. "Do you want this?" She asked. "Uh huh," I answered, and then she started to rock back and forth. "Oh God," She let out a long sigh as she moved down the full length of my shaft, inch by sensual inch. "I'm sorry!" she said.</p> <p>"Don't be," I cried, as I felt her tongue encircle my sensitive head. She sucked hard and slid down faster, and then she backed off. "Do you want my tongue on you," she asked. "I want you there!" was her reply. She went to work on me again, lifting her ass off my lap. She lifted my head up as she slid my cock into her again. "Do you want me inside you, inside me?" She asked. "I want you to be mine," I answered. "I want to be inside you," I was saying, and she nodded. "Then I want the bed to be set up right."</p> <p>She put a pillow under my head soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
