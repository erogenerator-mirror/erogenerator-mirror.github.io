I love that business."</p> <p>"Okay," I whispered. I really wanted her to return the favor, but I was concerned about the other customers in the world. I asked her to be with me and she assured me that it would be okay. With a smile, she walked over to the closet and pulled off her blouse and pulled off her skirt. She wasn't wearing panties so I wasn't surprised she had no panty when she walked over. Without taking my eyes off her I kissed her thigh as she started to undo my pants. When the pants were off I pulled her to me and she kissed me passionately right there in the closet. I felt her tongue slip into my mouth and the passion building in the room.</p> <p>Finally she pulled back and said, "Take off the rest of your clothes and get in the shower. I haven't had time to change because we still have the conference call. It's a long time until we have that kind of conference." She stood there looking at me in the mirror, thinking for several minutes, then she walked over to the tub and looked at her reflection. "I like what I'm wearing! That's so hot."</p> <p>"Good. I like the way you think!" I was still naked, my cock was already hard and I was aching between my legs. A few more seconds and I would be naked too.</p> <p>She took a step closer and ran her hand down my chest and over my dick. "You're a very big man, and I like that. I like being with big guys. But I'm a married woman!"</p> <p>"Honey, you don't have the power! I'm just a man with a wife and family." Without knowing why, my cock lurched, aching for her attention.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not a married woman. I'm just a customer who likes beautiful women. That's all. I just wanted to know if everything was okay."</p> <p>I thought about going over to her but I was so overcome with the sexual tension in the room that I wanted to do it again. It would be wrong to touch her. There would be no way of knowing how it had happened. After our first visit, we hadn't made love. I wanted her so badly but didn't know what to do.</p> <p>"Don't do it. Please. I'm not a bad looking woman and if it was wrong, I didn't want to do anything to you. Please!"</p> <p>"Honey, you're very beautiful and I can do anything that turns you on."</p> <p>Even though it bothered me because of what she'd said, I was in a state of despair. Why would she say that? I knew she was right, so I just wanted to please her. Then the thought struck me. My wife is in our home office, getting ready for clients and my job was a part time sales consultant. She was a beautiful woman with a great figure for her age but she wasn't a model. She had to get a good job or lose her job.</p> <p>My mind wasn't on anything but thinking about how she had helped me. I hadn't been with another woman in almost a decade. Why would she want me anyway? When I got there I couldn't take my eyes off her. She had a great body and I wouldn't mind the attention she was giving me. She told me how much she liked to play with herself and that she preferred to touch her self. She also got a nice looking cock in her hand and I wondered if that meant it was too much of a stretch, or was she just playing with herself to see what she could do to please me.</p> <p>She knew I was looking at her but it wasn't as if we were strangers. This was very rare for both of us so neither was concerned about our intimacy. After that first visit we had very little in common. She always made me feel sexy. We talked about work and how she wasn't allowed to talk about anything personal. We made love every day just to feel each other's eyes on the outside of our clothes. Then again we were both married or our spouses were in a relationship. I'd tell her I had an affair or that she didn't want to hear about me cheating or that we were having sex and I'd end up getting divorced. My wife didn't understand but at the end of the day and in the next week, she was very happy.</p> <p>Once we were married I went over to the company and made my pitch. I was willing to give it a try and we agreed to see what happened. She accepted it all the way across the company. She even let my boss talk her into letting the company have sex with me. The first two weeks were just about a week apart and it really didn't matter that I was with another womanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
