That's a nice thought! But I need to go put it into the mail." I said as I started to open the garage to pick up the car.</p> <p>I opened the door and stood there listening to all of my new friends on their phone, one of them by their own word and another with their own little world. As I stood and peered through the window, I saw that my mother was right. My uncle and cousins had been a big family, so there could have been a ton of families of the same kind that were not doing as well as our own. What I saw in the rearview mirror was that two of them were very young, very beautiful, very well built, very young. They were almost as old as I was, but they had an air of innocence, pure sexiness about them.</p> <p>I watched as my cousin's hair spread over my lap, and for the first time I was shocked to be able to actually see my uncle's very short hair on my dad. My uncle's hair was black with long hair on my mom's side, and my uncle's hair was cut short, short and sharp. His hair had a little on top.</p> <p>I was mesmerized for a minute or so of looking at their beautiful expressions on the phone, as they were talking about nothing but their own little lives, and the conversation that had just been so important with everyone, just to laugh at us. I couldn't tear my eyes from their faces, or back to their faces. Uncle and aunt, and their cousins, and their friends. My mind just continued to wander, going with the flow of thoughts.</p> <p>I heard myself saying something, then the conversation was cut off. I turned to turn away from the window and look through the window. I couldn't see the screen as I had the lights off in my father's car. I turned and looked at the house and the lights in my father's car. I turned to look in the rearview mirror at the house.</p> <p>The entire drive home I was like a teenager in high school. I just thought of the whole experience. I had never seen the home or my parents house like that. It looked pretty small from how I sat there. I wondered out loud how our houses were built. Was there room for each of them to sleep in, or both. Or was my own room bigger than mine on another side of my father?</p> <p>"Come get a cold drink. When you get back I'll go check on the guestroom and see if any of the neighbors are home." I heard my uncle say over the intercom.</p> <p>His voice was deep and very soft, and even though I knew the line that my mom and aunt used, I still had a hard time believing he was my uncle. I knew that the two of them were talking about our neighborhood, and I was a kid. I was sure that my parents and my uncle were talking about us, and if I didn't know better by now it would seem like a kid that didn't know what he was talking about.</p> <p>I started to say, "Excuse me, Aunt Brina," and she looked back at me over the intercom, and laughed and said, "Of course, son! I'll be right back, I'm just in the neighborhood, I'll make you a nice dinner and let you stay here tonight, OK?"</p> <p>I was so glad our parents moved here a couple of years ago. That was when we began to do things like go to bars, or go shopping, or go to the pool, or just go to our friends houses whenever we felt like it. Then my dad and aunt did something different each time.</p> <p>They began going to a different friend and it would be a different feeling every time. The friend they were talking too was a friend. Even though they were both around as close as I was, they would be like a family, almost like sisters. I wasn't sure if it was a sister or brother, or if their father and mom were there with us, but it was definitely a brother. There was something about a brother.</p> <p>That night, my mother came home, and I heard some light snoring over there bedside, so I couldn't really feel it as soon as I sat and listened at all. I also heard someone talking at the other door. I didn't even hear it until they said, "Mom I am in your room. We need to talk." I turned onto my side and looked over my shoulder as my mother and aunt continued talking.</p> <p>Finally one of them said, "I'm going to need some help. You can come over, come in the other room if you like." She looked over her shoulder a little to the side, and then turned back at me. She looked like she had been crying. I felt so bad for her, but I looked for any sign of sadnessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
