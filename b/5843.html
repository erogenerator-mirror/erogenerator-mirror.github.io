I thought you were supposed to be a model." She smiled when she saw the look on his face. "That was your first gig when you played for that 'Titan' band in Miami."</p> <p>"Oh, I got to be the best I could be," he told her with a smile."</p> <p>'Titan, what did he mean?"</p> <p>"He was singing at me, not as a microphone." He didn't sound all that amused anymore. "At the house. It's my first gig. I got some bad vibes from some of the women at the house. When I walked in that room, the whole room was filled with women and kids playing at the same time." He winked at her for effect. "It sounded like you were having one hell of a time getting ready for it."</p> <p>An evil thought crossed her mind. "Where are you from?"</p> <p>"I'm from Miami. I'm originally from Atlanta. That's what I went to school at. But what's your story, by any chance are you having sex with other guys in the theater?"</p> <p>"I don't know, probably if that's where I'm from," she said with a shrug with a pout. "What about you?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure," he lied. It seemed like his mind was still in a sexual daze. "I guess I did go to school with just three different girls though, like last year and then this year.</p> <p>"I really liked that period," she laughed. They both got up and headed to the back of the room where a room was set up in the back of the room.</p> <p>"Let me get this straight," he told her. "You're eighteen, and I'm nineteen, and I never saw any of the girls at school without their panties.</p> <p>"Well, I have to tell you one word. There hasn't been a boy at my high school who hasn't had a little fun in the back seat of his car. It was one of the worst summers of my life."</p> <p>"That's true," she agreed. She didn't want him to get uncomfortable. "So how did you get into porn, or what sort of movies," she asked him.</p> <p>"Well, I had gotten into porn. In the summer, I went to parties and got drunk when I was nineteen. I got home an hour later and I got caught. I got arrested and I'm not sure what, if any of the girls at school caught me," he explained. He turned to look at her, and saw a puzzled look on her face.</p> <p>"Were you in there when the drugs got mixed in?" She asked with a frown.</p> <p>"No, but it looked like that. After the drugs got mixed, my body had a feeling of going crazy. I went to my bedroom and hid in the closet, and masturbated to my own orgasm." He paused to let her digest her reaction. His mind was running wild. He had to know if she had any real feelings for him, but that his plan was so ingenious; in fact, he thought it was.</p> <p>"What happens next?" she asked.</p> <p>"You'll see," he told her. "The only thing left is to find out for yourself. I'm willing to let you try some of the other things you know and that you'll like more."</p> <p>As he told her the rest of the story, she couldn't believe she was hearing this. Maybe it was the alcohol. Or maybe it was because of the weed she thought it was. She was thinking back to all the other times she had been alone in bed and fantasized about it. She had gotten to experience more of those things than she knew she should, before going to college.</p> <p>"Do you like to watch porn?" he asked her gently. "I know a place you can go if you want to."</p> <p>"I really like it. It's actually pretty fun to watch." She didn't know what to think of his idea. She loved porn and always had masturbated to it. Now it seemed ridiculous that she would do anything with him. She thought about if he were interested in her, as the first time with the two guys was a few months ago. She was ready to learn how to please herself.</p> <p>"You'll think you're the world's biggest pervert, if you weren't so eager to get laid," he told her.</p> <p>"What?" she laughed. "No, it's not that."</p> <p>"Well, I like it when your first time is something you really enjoy, isn't it?" he asked her.</p> <p>"I think it's a really nice kind of perversionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
