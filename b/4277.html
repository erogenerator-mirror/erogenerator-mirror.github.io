I stood there in front of her while I reached out to grab her hand, I pulled her in until I found her lips with mine and kissed her again.</p> <p>"This is nice." I looked into her eyes as I took off my jacket and hung it on the chair before taking her hand again and moving her closer. I wanted to touch her. I needed to. So I gently took her hands and placed them around my neck as my hands slid over her back. I leaned in slowly and kissed her again, moving my mouth down over her ear and finally to her lips. I leaned back slightly and looked into her eyes as we made out. She looked so beautiful. I kissed the tip of her nose and then slowly kissed back up to her lips. I closed my eyes and felt a tingling rush of excitement from the light kisses. My heart was beating so fast just because I was doing this to her.</p> <p>When I finally broke off the kiss I smiled at her. "I know you want to touch me."</p> <p>She just grinned and grabbed me and pulled me against her in a quick hug and turned my face up to meet her own. Our mouths were just inches apart and it was still a bit of a shock when we finally kissed again. After making out for a while she pulled away a bit and looked at me.</p> <p>"Let me get dressed and go to the bathroom."</p> <p>"No," I said, "go home and stay there tonight." I held her hand and tried to smile as I pulled up my pants.</p> <p>"I just want to go talk to you for a little bit." I could feel my heart beat really loud now and I knew she was worried. I let her go before I started feeling bad myself. I wasn't sure how I would survive if she saw the way I reacted to her touching me. I had always wanted me to feel like I had. I could feel tears forming in my eyes. I wanted to just walk away.</p> <p>"Don't," she said, "don't even walk away from me. You'll never see me the rest of the way home."</p> <p>"I don't know," I said. "I think I need to get back to the apartment and get some clothes on and run."</p> <p>"That's good. That's the only way I can go through this."</p> <p>"You're not leaving until you come back and make love to me."</p> <p>"I'm not leaving except to tell you that we can't." she said. We were both a bit shocked but it didn't stop us from just going back to her and talking. After some time we were able to get naked and then kiss again as we lay on our sides. I kept my eyes closed and just enjoyed the feeling of her skin against mine as our kisses continued. I kept my back arched and felt her breasts pressing into my back as I kissed her. I kept kissing her and finally got up, not stopping the kisses even as we stood and looked at each other. She grabbed my hands and put them on her breasts, letting me feel how soft and smooth they were.</p> <p>"I don't see anything wrong with what you've got."</p> <p>"I know. I just wish you could make love to me." I lifted her and pushed her back down on to the bed, then moved up and kissed her again. I could see her lips glistening with a drop of her cum as I continued. I moved down her body and took her nipple into my mouth and gently nibbled on it as I kissed down her stomach. I couldn't wait to taste her again.</p> <p>My tongue trailed down her stomach towards her pussy. I stopped right before I touched it, waiting for her approval. When I touched her she let out an incredible sigh. Her pussy was so smooth and soft.</p> <p>I brought my mouth back up and slowly ran my tongue along her slit. I took her legs and slowly ran my tongue over her labia, making sure to go deep into her pussy. I moved away from her clit and licked back down to her vagina. After just a few seconds of sliding my tongue in and out I pushed my tongue deeply into her cunt and tasted the mix of her juices and my saliva. I looked up and saw her looking over at me with a lust in her eyes that just made me want to please her more.</p> <p>I continued my exploration and slowly brought my hand into contact with her clitoris. The contact was extremely erotic. With my tongue still out, I started moving down until I was just touching her pussy with my tongue. I moved up between her legs again only this time I didn't have to tease with my tongue as I plunged my tongue into her againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
