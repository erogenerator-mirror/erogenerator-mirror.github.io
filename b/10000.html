That seemed to ease the uneasiness that had been the first thing on his mind since they had left the party.</p> <p>"When does the time to say goodbye end?"</p> <p>"Soon at least."</p> <p>"I'm pretty excited about being here."</p> <p>"Yes, you are."</p> <p>She wanted to ask him a question that never came; but she could think of nothing else to ask him, particularly since she wasn't sure if she would be able to respond.</p> <p>"When will you be back in the city?"</p> <p>"Well, I still have a year to go until I start my year."</p> <p>"A year?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"That means that you are not working now."</p> <p>"I'm certainly not," he said, "but I can see that you are doing a great job at work."</p> <p>"I'm trying," she said, "but with your help I can't work at all."</p> <p>"I understand. Why don't you leave work early tomorrow and come back here. I'll give you a call when you get back to your car."</p> <p>"Are you trying with something?"</p> <p>"No, I just want to see you," he said, laughing as he did it.</p> <p>When she asked him where he was staying that evening he laughed again.</p> <p>"Are you going to tell me about work?" she asked, taking his hand and looking into his eyes while holding his hand for a while.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he said, "but I thought we could finish this off before you go home."</p> <p>"I'm happy for you," she said as he bent and kissed her. "I love you. I'll stay."</p> <p>"No, you stay," he said, breaking the kiss, "I have some things I need to tell you."</p> <p>"Yes, we'll both go." He took her by the hand and led her to the door. Once they stepped out and he closed the door his mouth was on her body again. She put her hand on his crotch but he backed her up against the wall and slipped his tongue down her throat a bit. She could feel him hard and ready to go and wanted to go and touch him.</p> <p>"Are you really serious about me not telling anyone about my work?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, you can come back anytime you need to be and I'll do anything for you."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 14</p> <p>"Did you have second thoughts at the time?"</p> <p>"No," she said, "I never did anything except kiss and feel you."</p> <p>"Hmmm. I have just one more question."</p> <p>"What?" as she looked at him in shock.</p> <p>"Did you love him?" he asked after he said that.</p> <p>"I didn't love him," she said.</p> <p>"Yes you did love him. Did he love you?" he asked.</p> <p>"No," she said, "I wasn't sure. I had trouble thinking," she said, "like I haven't thought of a man since college. But now that I am going away on my own I'm really happy.</p> <p>"And do you love him?" he asked as he slipped the robe off her shoulders and let it drop to the floor.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "It's just different when I think of him and not him."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"When he's away, with you, other men, I love it when they do it, but it's different when they're with you."</p> <p>He smiled at her. "Do you have to answer?"</p> <p>"No, I just want to love him once more and that was about all I could think about with you."</p> <p>She was in his arms again. She felt him slip the robe off her shoulders. She could see his cock as if it would burst right in front of her face. At the same time she could feel her own heat. She knew that she was very aroused.
