He then began to kiss her neck and then began to run his tongue around it.</p> <p>"Oh, yes..."</p> <p>After a few moments more of running his tongue around her neck, he began to nibble on it and she knew he was in no hurry to come to her.</p> <p>He then grabbed another condom and ripped open the package and rolled it down his cock.</p> <p>The look on her face surprised her completely. He watched as she saw he cock in his hand and then smiled.</p> <p>As he laid her on the bed on her stomach, he started to kiss and lick her neck, sliding his tongue slowly along her skin and making her moan from time to time.</p> <p>He made one final swipe at her shoulders and she felt his hand slide down her body, sliding over her flat belly and then onto her hips.</p> <p>He slid a finger into her wet hole and she felt his eyes move over her body, focusing on her breasts.</p> <p>"You are wet...I didn't know it would be this wet..."</p> <p>As he removed the condom off of him, he smiled at her as he slid it down and then down onto his cock and she felt it slide into her wetness, he took the latex and began to tease her breast, before he slid it into her mouth and she licked it greedily and watched as it glistened in the dim light.</p> <p>He slid it out and then slid it into her again.</p> <p>He slid the tip of his cock into her dripping hole, and as she felt the hardness, she began to move back toward him, but he would not allow it.</p> <p>"Please...please...fuck me..."</p> <p>She could hear something being said, but what she could not make out.</p> <p>"Are you wet?" he asked her.</p> <p>"For you," she said, letting her words hang in the air between them between their thrusts.</p> <p>She was now on her back, which was just like he had asked her to do. He leaned over her and whispered in her ear,</p> <p>"Are you ready? I want you to be ready..."</p> <p>She nodded her head, letting her head drop as he slid down from her neck, and then to her stomach again. He slid down again, and again she felt him slide across her abdomen, but he did not move, but just let her wait for her own pleasure.</p> <p>He moved from behind her again, leaning down and placing his hands on either side of her face. He kissed her, gently pushing his tongue into her mouth and then into her mouth.</p> <p>He moved forward on his knees until he was kneeling between her legs. He put one knee between hers and with the other he began to push his hard cock into her wet hole, feeling her lips wrap around it.</p> <p>She could feel the length of his cock inside of her, and she could feel his hands grasping at her hips...she couldn't control it.</p> <p>He moved her hands from his face and used them to rub her tits while he began to slide his cock in and out of her pussy, as she reached under herself and felt his swollen balls.</p> <p>"You are really wet," he said as he thrust faster and deeper into her pussy, which she heard was starting to make it harder to breathe.</p> <p>She was starting to feel the wetness in her pussy increase as she started to moan, feeling her pussy clench around his cock each time he thrust into her again.</p> <p>Her moans grew in intensity as he pulled her body against him. Her tits were rubbing against his chest as she began to push her body back toward him.</p> <p>She reached down and began to rub her clit as his cock continued to slide quickly in and out of her.</p> <p>"Yes, yes...fuck yes..."</p> <p>He continued to thrust into her, and was soon groaning as he felt himself begin to cum.</p> <p>"Yes, yes..." she heard him say between moans.</p> <p>He slid his entire cock out of her and she could feel his load spilling out of her and onto the bed.</p> <p>He kissed her head and then, without removing his cock from her pussy, began to crawl up her body, as she laid there in exhaustion.</p> <p>He kissed her forehead and neck and then ran his hand down her body and to her ass as he began to gently squeeze her ass cheeks and pulled back to her breasts.</p> <p>She could feel his cock against her body, she moaned again. She was still moaning as he kissed her neck and kissed her there. She could feel tears welling up inside her as he began to slide back toward her in slow, steady strokes.</p> <p>She began to shake and shake harder and harder as she felt her orgasm begin to explodeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
