The crowd cheered with the sound of my shots, and he was soon back on his feet. He was standing there with his hands by his waist with the whole thing over his head, and when I took it off, he quickly dropped his hands and kicked off. I was just to close to him to hit where he left me when a hand grabbed my arm and jerked me back.</p> <p>It was the most unexpected thing I've ever heard. I stumbled into him. I was looking right into his face as he started to struggle while I grabbed his right hand and pulled his wrist back behind his elbow. He was soon pulling on it, struggling and trying to get my arm through the handcuffs as he tried to get my arm free.</p> <p>"Get me off you bitch." He said in a low tone. I turned my head and saw the guy behind me getting up, but he was out of the pool quickly. I quickly spun around and put the gun away from me, but before I could shoot, the guy standing over me began to pull the trigger on a .44-30. I felt as though a bolt of electricity shot straight through my body and into the guy behind me. With the shots coming from close range, there was no way I could get away from him but I couldn't go back. I heard the guy behind me say something to me before he shot my gun and turned around to see the guy standing in the shadows.</p> <p>He was tall, but not as tall as the guy standing behind him, his hands held by his back just above his shoulders. It looked like he was six-packs. He was laughing as he yelled at me for letting him and the guy behind me get away from me. He was clearly the shooter. Suddenly, I realized how he was in the shadows, and I just kept right on with the guy behind me. He reached out and grabbed my arm, just above my shoulder. He started to pull my arm away from his body with his left hand, and I was suddenly pulled along by the other guy behind me, by the other man's chest. Without any idea of who or what they were, the two hands grabbed me around the waist and they yanked me down onto the ground. It felt like a weightless weight lifted. I was so full of terror and fear that it was almost more than I could handle. The guy holding me couldn't have moved me much less be able to breathe.</p> <p>Before he completely pulled the gun away from me, I realized he had pulled the handcuffs off of me. I quickly looked out the window to see if the cops were out yet, but they weren't.</p> <p>I was still on the ground with the guy holding me in one arm, and holding me with the other arm in my lap. The guy next to me had pulled my leg up into the air and was starting to stroke up the side of my leg toward my hip. I was helpless right under his fingers. My legs were spread wide in front of him. As he kept going, he started to caress me with his fingertip.</p> <p>"Spread her legs." He said in a low voice. I obediently spread my legs for him, giving him access to my most private parts. He slid his finger slowly up and down along my slit, and I felt myself start to react. He pushed in slightly before pushing out again, and then just pushed again. I was afraid of how my thighs would be able to contain me. I was trying to lift myself off the ground so I could use my legs to try to move them to get back up, but I couldn't. I just kept them open to let him continue playing with me.</p> <p>"Now," he said quietly. "Look over towards the street."</p> <p>Before I could do anything else, he pulled the handkerchief out of his mouth, and I had to reach behind me to wipe it off. I was feeling like I was about to fall. Then I was about to fall again.</p> <p>"Now try and push back against this," he said.</p> <p>He pulled me up slightly on my toes, and turned me so they were both against the wall, then put his hand on the inside of me. I couldn't feel the wall, but I could feel the handkerchief between my legs. He leaned in toward me, and his breath felt warm against my neck.</p> <p>"Open yourself to me," he whispered. "I'm going to make sure you're nice and juicy."</p> <p>My eyes were wide as I nodded to him, and he slowly slid his hand back down to my crotch. The handkerchief still covered in the guys' juices made him slide his hand slightly in and out slowly. It felt amazing.
