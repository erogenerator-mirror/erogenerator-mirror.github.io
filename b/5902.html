"Just feel I need some help."</p> <p>"Okay, I can help."</p> <p>A minute later, he was standing beside the table. He handed him a glass of water. He said something about how his sister and her brother had gotten sick or something, then left, and took the glass back to her.</p> <p>"I think I need to go," he said as he stepped back outside. "I'll see if the doctor can do some quick tests this afternoon."</p> <p>"Well, it looks like it's safe now. Just be careful and don't do anything to injure or kill them," she urged him. Then she turned to see what was wrong. His friend, Jake, had been watching him closely. He was sitting on the front porch in front of them. He wasn't smiling. When she saw him, she looked back and got it.</p> <p>"No." She said, walking slowly away. Then she turned her hand to see if he liked her and saw that he had a worried look on his face. His friend was standing in her way. She felt a cold chill go up her spine and it went through her body like it was happening to her. She walked back to the table to sit down. She looked at Jake briefly and then back to the guy on the front patio. She didn't look at him, but there were tears running down her cheeks. She was worried that it was some kind of mistake and that Jake took everything too far.</p> <p>She looked at Jake. He was looking at her. She had tears streaking down her cheek and one was dripping down her chin onto her breasts. She was standing there with two broken hands and a large welt on her right cheek. He reached out and wiped it away then smiled at her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. Why are you crying?" she asked.</p> <p>"Why do you think I'm here?" he asked.</p> <p>"Jake told me."</p> <p>"Yeah, he did," he said, then took a step toward her. "I can't go by myself with you like this."</p> <p>"You think so?"</p> <p>"I do. Why?" he asked.</p> <p>"Because your parents said they would hate to see me with your sister," she said.</p> <p>"That's what I think." Jake said. "I'm sorry but he won't understand. I'm so sorry he put me in this mess. Don't ever be ashamed."</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "I agree," she told him. He looked at his friend and then walked toward her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he told her. "I thought I was being nice. I really thought that you were going to stop hurting."</p> <p>"I guess," she said. "I'm sorry I have to tell you this, but Jake and I were friends back in college."</p> <p>"So you are a lesbian," he said.</p> <p>"No, I don't want to be," she told him. "Maybe not forever, but I feel that I'll never forgive him or anyone for the way he made me feel...I didn't know we actually touched," she said.</p> <p>"It wasn't anything," he said. "I just wanted to help so I did."</p> <p>"I can't believe how you took over here for me. I love you guys. That's all that matters."</p> <p>"Yeah. I told you we'll never forgive or forget. We'll just be friends," Jake said, not meaning to hurt his sister.</p> <p>"I love you, too." She told him.</p> <p>"I love you to," they said, then Jake walked back inside and closed the door.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry for making you feel that way," he said standing and closing the door.</p> <p>"It's okay. I guess I'll just stay in my room."</p> <p>"I think we should go," she told him.</p> <p>"I should get some sleep," he said as he made his way inside and laid down in the bed. He was exhausted.</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said. "I wish I could say the same."</p> <p>"I'm sorry. That was nice. I'm glad it was a night he was alive too. We're only here a few minutes." The three of them fell asleep while hugging and kissing each other's faces and necks.</p> <p>That's where the next chapter came in. She had a lot to go through, so a lot of reading would be needed as well.
