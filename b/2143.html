Of course, I've gone to pee many times before by myself, but never without a partner.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied.</p> <p>I heard him inhale and his voice seemed to be getting a little harder.</p> <p>"Do you want to try it with me," he asked</p> <p>So, I opened my thighs and stuck my hand in the toilet.</p> <p>"Try what?" he asked as his hand closed over my hand, leaving my legs wide apart. I took one step and his fingers closed around my pussy, he moved so he could push his fingers inside my wetness, it was so tight and hot. He moved his other hand around the back of my knee and held my right leg open, still he moved forward and pushed his finger into my pussy and I felt him moving it up and down. I wanted him to feel me.</p> <p>As though he understood my desire, he slipped his finger in and out several times. I felt like I was in the bathroom of an airport. At first, I felt like I had a belly full of pee in one go. I'm not sure I was ready to go that far and then it was at full speed. I don't understand why. My bladder was full. He moved his finger from inside me and sat up, "How old are you?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm 21," I said.</p> <p>"Twenty years old," he said laughing when I made a face.</p> <p>"But you should be at college," I argued.</p> <p>"Don't play that game with me," he said. I tried to think what he had in mind. There were some things in the way of sex or the way that we might like to be like. I really hadn't thought of getting a job after what he did to me at the airport. He was going to make a porno movie about us. If I could have any job after that, I couldn't give that job to that guy.</p> <p>"I'd like that," he said.</p> <p>As I was thinking I said, "But I have to leave soon, I have a job to do."</p> <p>He laughed. "Good thing we get out of here tomorrow," he said.</p> <p>He put the coffee on the table and sat down where I had left him.</p> <p>"Will you do a movie?" he asked.</p> <p>I said, "Sure," and stood up.</p> <p>He stared at me, "You will do good," he said in his deep voice. Then he took his finger from inside me and put it to his mouth. He sucked it dry and said, "Try to be a good girl," and he turned around and left the roomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
