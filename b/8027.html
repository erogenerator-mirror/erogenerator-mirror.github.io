He said eagerly, "I'm there again!" He finished himself off, taking it gently and squeezing on it firmly.</p> <p>She felt a warm glow as he stroked his cock again, which was now rock solid, but not hard.</p> <p>"I'm a bit sore." She said. "But I still want to be good for you," she replied. They lay on their foreheads, facing each other and stroked together, their chests pressed together.</p> <p>"You're beautiful!" He murmured. "No one has ever made me feel that way." He stroked her breasts, running his hands over them a bit more, then rubbing them a bit. "That feels so wonderful." He whispered. "Especially when I think about you."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"All my friends say this when we're out to ourselves!" he replied. "It's always 'be like old times' - 'I love you' or 'I wanted to talk to you about something.'" His stroked her breasts up, his fingers rubbing her nipples.</p> <p>"You still haven't made it this way with you, have you?" she said, rolling over and kissing him. He responded by pulling her onto his mouth, her nipples taut against him and her back arching as she kissed him. His hand slid down and over her bum and back up, his finger dipping between her cheeks and feeling the flesh there.</p> <p>"I've wanted you so long, Paul," She said. "I've wanted to be near you since we met."</p> <p>"And you had been all along!" He replied, pushing her up a bit and kissing her shoulders and neck. She stroked his face; he was soft all over, kissing her chin a bit, then, when she closed her eyes and smiled at his lips, he'd kiss behind her ear and down to her throat.</p> <p>"I was looking forward to it all right," she said. "Now I want you to make love to me."</p> <p>"I just thought..." He said, looking at her with a bit of a confused expression on his face.</p> <p>"I know," she said. "I want you so much. Please." She had a bit more than eagerness in her voice that he wanted her to say it right now.</p> <p>"Alright, alright," He said, lifting her a little and kissing her breast slowly, then moving down to her navel. "You're all ready - now, all around the world! And I want us to be totally committed at the end."</p> <p>"You're beautiful!" She said quietly again. "I want to be with you all the time!"</p> <p>"Will you make it just as wonderful with me?" He asked. "Or could we both just be committed and stay friends the rest of our lives? I want you to be my friend too!"</p> <p>They kissed again as he slid her back down his body, to lie beside her. They spent all of their spare time kissing and making slow love as they lay there, looking up at the huge stars in the night sky. Her legs were spread out on either side of him. Her arms were wrapped around his head, hers and his around hers. They lay there for long minutes, kissing and stroking, both feeling at peace.</p> <p>"How long has this been?" Paul asked her.</p> <p>"Too long," She said, "my love."</p> <p>"I don't like that part, at least not here." He said.</p> <p>"But with me, this is the best possible part," He replied, kissing her breast again. "I'm very fond of you, darling."</p> <p>"I'm still a virgin! Why is that? I want to be with you." She said. "We've not made love all this time!"</p> <p>"Then why did you want to be with me?" He asked her. "Are you afraid that I might have to marry someone else?" he said.</p> <p>"I'm not worried," She replied, her eyes gazing down, gazing at his cock. "But I am, and I guess I'm just excited by the whole thing."</p> <p>"That's beautiful," He said, kissing her shoulder, neck, and breasts as she stroked his cock.</p> <p>"If we had it, I want to find your penis, Paul. Can you do that for me, please?" She asked him.</p> <p>"Of course I will," He said. "I wouldn't be able to stand it!"</p> <p>"Can you just kiss the head?" She said, taking his dick back into her mouth. "It feels... amazing!"</p> <p>"Will you?" He asked, lifting the head of his cock up and pressing it against her opening. "It's been so long..."
