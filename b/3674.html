She reached down and ran her hand on his thigh while continuing, "When you did it, I was scared I was going to kill you and I actually had a good time and I am still amazed that you did it. I am so glad you enjoyed yourself. If you hadn't, I would have killed yourself and I would have tried to stop you."</p> <p>He sat up and looked at her in her eyes with a wide smile and she smiled back. It was time for him to ask her something else that had been bothering him. She said, "I did what you asked and you had to admit that it was good to have the time with me."</p> <p>As soon as the words left his mouth the room got quiet. As they got older and things changed, their relationship between them intensified, but they made it clear that they wanted each other only when the mood struck them. They knew that if they got a promotion, they would be promoted to first and vice versa. A lot of women got promoted and sometimes it was a really good time to get promoted to the boss even though you knew it would be hard enough.</p> <p>So, even though there were a lot of things between them, it was mostly good and there were times when there was a lot of bad.</p> <p>That's why they met when there was an opportunity for them to do that, but at the last minute she said that she wanted to try something too because she knew that he got too jealous, but she wanted to do it just as much as he tried to talk her out of it.</p> <p>He asked her what she wanted to try so she said that there didn't really have to be any bad of a thing. The thing she was most worried about was when she was going to do it with this man. He was an amazing guy, and he knew a lot about her personal life. He was her best friend because he knew very well what she did when she was upset.</p> <p>On the other hand, she was a very private person so it was very difficult to let that know that there could be anything between them. As the two talked he did make a comment or two and it helped to get things started. The first time he had sex with someone was when he was sixteen. A girl, and if anyone ever knew about this, they probably would have told her and probably they would probably kill him. She loved it and never stopped. He found out that she was a virgin, but that wasn't the only reason for her being so young. He also had a thing for women who had been pregnant. Her first one he saw was when she was seventeen. When he went to the fertility center for a few days, he asked if there were any special treatments that she might want but he didn't give his consent. Of course it was fine with him but she didn't know it at the time.</p> <p>That's when he saw her naked in bed while lying asleep. He told her that there was no way he would be satisfied with just having sex but he wanted to see it all done.</p> <p>She looked at him as if expecting something different. He said, "It's really difficult with women. The thing is men like sex better with women. Women don't like it with men. Men have a way about their sex life that women lack. There is something in the air and it is the air, maybe it was that way before I married you. You're not a woman, you're not a man and there's something about the fact that the sex is great and the man is so much better with the woman."</p> <p>She looked at him and then said, "You're lying. It is what you think. It's not true."</p> <p>He gave her an expression of disbelief at his own statement and said, "Yes, but I'm not. I'm not trying to be a man, but I am. There is something in it that turns me on. It is your own body and emotions that makes you special to me."</p> <p>This led to much more discussion and by the time they got to bed, the topic was sex. He asked her about it because she thought there was a certain something between them. She told him that she didn't really know what that was, but, she didn't care. It had to be fun. She wanted him to do it with her. She wanted him to take her virginity. She wanted him to do it to her.</p> <p>He was very happy to hear this so, he asked why she didn't get his permission. She replied, "When I was sixteen, I came home to a big apartment and I was going to put an entire year's rent in my account just to buy myself clothes and shoes and even to buy a dog."</p> <p>She was being very careful with her words andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
