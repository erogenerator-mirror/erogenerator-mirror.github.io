She turned over and reached out for me.</p> <p>When we came together I lifted her into my arms and carried her as she laid on her back on the bedspread. We laid next to each other, kissing a little, and I held her. "God, what is getting to me?"</p> <p>"Don't feel guilty, just like I did when we were little." As my hand drifted down, her hand came up beside me and gently caressed my cheek. I kissed her, then slowly trailed her lips down to the corners of my mouth and her nose. Our tongues played until she reached out for my cock.</p> <p>"We should probably get dressed. It's late."</p> <p>"Don't do that at the door," she said, giggling at my grin. She reached down to pick up the robe she had worn and we quickly dressed. I slid the chair next to me to allow her to pull it off the bed. Her panties were a little damp from my earlier attentions and she was still naked by the time I was dressed.</p> <p>We walked into the living room and she turned back at me.</p> <p>"This should be good."</p> <p>"I'd call it the best thing I've ever done."</p> <p>"Good." She turned to me and placed her hands on my shoulders.</p> <p>"I'm really a guy. I can't get tired of a good night roll."</p> <p>"You know what I meant."</p> <p>"Why? You're a virgin?"</p> <p>"You mean your first time, or is it?" I laughed. I could feel her nipples hardening in her bra.</p> <p>"I had a boyfriend, and he was kind of clumsy around me."</p> <p>"Like me? Is that right?" She took my hand and pressed it between her breasts to feel their softness.</p> <p>"I don't know," I said, "I've had a few relationships since high school too and never got to as good as I can.</p> <p>"So do you like me?"</p> <p>"I love you all right, but I'm really confused. How am I supposed to know that you haven't been with a girl?"</p> <p>"Well," she said, "it's been a while since I've been with another woman."</p> <p>"So are you still going to tell me, or will you wait until you finish your dinner?"</p> <p>"I don't want to upset your plans," she said. I pulled the robe off her, then handed it to her. I slipped the robe on and we hugged. Then I helped her into it and, sitting on the couch, she leaned against me.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're all right, Sam?" she asked, looking at me.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's just that I'm kind of nervous about it too. I didn't expect things..."</p> <p>"What do you mean about everything?"</p> <p>"I guess things really were different between us. I mean, if I'd known then that I'd have told you, I wouldn't have gone with you. I think part of me knows that this is only going to be a one time thing. It'll be the beginning with me... and then maybe with you, or maybe with him." I stroked her leg as she sat there.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll wait. I'm sure you're all right with what your girlfriend told me, and that's all that matters."</p> <p>"I'm not sure what your girlfriend is saying. Do you want to see me again?"</p> <p>"Not right now. I have to think, I have to figure this out." We both leaned across the couch and kissed. I could feel her hips grinding against me. Then she turned and ran off to the bathroom. I went to the bathroom and got off the toilet. I took a quick look of the evidence of Sam's wetness on the back of the toilet, then put in a washcloth. When I came back to the living room I saw her in the living room, sitting on the couch. She was dressed and looking at a newspaper article I'd picked up yesterday. She looked up to see me standing there and I smiled back.</p> <p>"Don't you want to see me again Sam?"</p> <p>"Yeah, but I'm just going to try and do it to a guy." She smiled and went back to her magazine.</p> <p>"Sam," I said, "I promise I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do. I really want you with me," I turned and hugged her, and we ended up kissing all over each others' faces. "I feel bad for doing this," she said after a little kissing.</p> <p>"I feel very bad, you're the guy I want and I can't promise that I'll stop youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
