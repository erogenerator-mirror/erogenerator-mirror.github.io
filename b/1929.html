I had never been cumming like that before and I couldn't stop myself. I kept yelling out, "Oh, you motherfucker! Oh, oh, OH, OH!"</p> <p>I collapsed on the bed and she crawled over my face, pushing her pussy on my face, while I licked her out.</p> <p>I must have cum for at least ten minutes, until she got off of me and knelt down, leaning over, giving me a very sloppy tongue-lashing. Then we switched places sucking on each other and she leaned back and took several more loads in her mouth before letting up with her mouth.</p> <p>When it was over, she pulled me on top of her and we kissed passionately. I held her to me and we rolled over until she was on her back. In minutes our wet pussies were touching and rubbing as we kissed. Then I pulled off her panties and slid her soaked panties down. When I was naked, I went for her knees and then her ankles. I spread her legs wide and kissed her pussy, spreading her legs wide, and kissing and tonguing her pussy from front to back.</p> <p>Just like her before, she let out a long "mmm" and I felt her body twitching. I spread her legs more, exposing her anus and her beautiful pussy. I looked up into her face again and started taking her cheeks in my hands and spreading them apart as I started to slowly finger her.</p> <p>Soon, I felt the muscles of my stomach working for blood and I knew I was cumming as well. "Oh, God! Yes!" I yelled and held as long as I could to prolong the moment.</p> <p>When I was finished, I rolled off of her and put on her back, our faces turned to each other, and we both kissed. "I love you," I told her, "and I want us to be together as long as we need."</p> <p>"I love you too," she said, "and I love how passionate you can make me feel. That's the same thing as having a baby. I'm ready to have your baby."</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Later that evening, we decided we'd get married. I had decided I liked the way she loved me, but I didn't feel like getting married to you. I knew she loved me; I just didn't feel she loved me, and I knew she didn't feel like that when we were dating.</p> <p>She had no problem with me getting your sperm in her; she just didn't feel like you did. We both loved the sexual fun it gave us. After the last few days we were both thinking about each other. We'd planned it and I still hadn't felt like we were going to get married on our terms or on our terms; I hadn't been going so long without someone.</p> <p>When we made love to each other last night, nothing else in the world can compare to what we experienced. We were both sexually active, but not as good as one another. We both came very hard and she did as well. After I finished, we both said good-bye and went together to go to sleep.</p> <p>When we got to her place, we went to bed and slept with each other.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
