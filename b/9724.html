He had the largest bed in the whole house. There were mirrors on every corner. They stripped each other naked. He felt her legs go around his waist and his hands caress her body in a way he had only dreamed he'd dreamt about. Her tits were as hard as he had ever seen them and he felt his cock grow and harden as her bush of pubic hair grew and the pink lips of her cunt were exposed. He entered her with his long but not as thick as his, but he knew that it would take more to make himself hard than his long cock was long, but he was sure about that right now.</p> <p>He took her on the bed and she guided his cock to her cunt. She took the head of his cock and rubbed it into her pussy. She was ready and she wanted more. With her legs over his shoulders, she raised herself to his cock when it was just as long as it was so thick. She guided him into her depths.</p> <p>His hands went under her. She felt as if she couldn't move anymore. He entered her with a long slow push until he was buried in her. His hands cupped her tits while they were still moving in unison.</p> <p>"I love you Baby Girl" His hands on her ass pulled her to him with ever deep movement of their union.</p> <p>It felt as if she could not move and she felt every drop of his cum as it ran down her leg to her thigh. She pulled up her body to meet his. He felt the warmth of their bodies together. He felt something else about his cock inside her. He wanted to fuck her and let her be in love with him as much as he felt she wanted to be. This was the woman he had been in love with since the days when he first saw her. He wanted her to want him and she wanted him and he wanted to make love to her.</p> <p>When she was on top of him, he felt as if his cock needed more and that his entire body needed it. Her kisses and little cries gave his mind all the pleasure he wanted. He wanted her, that what they were and what they did in bed together. He felt their bodies against each other. He felt their bodies pressed together. Their juices and their sweat mingled with the juices they were generating from the passion of love.</p> <p>He moved on top of her. As he lowered his body, his cock slipped from her body. He watched her body and her cunt before he began to move inside her. It took every muscle and nerve in his body to move the way he wanted to be moving inside her. She was responding in all her own world of desire for him.</p> <p>He could feel her legs and calves against his chest. He moved his hands up and rubbed her tits as he fucked his beautiful, sweet, sexy girlfriend. He moved his hips in a slow rhythm, and then he moved them back into her faster.</p> <p>"Baby Girl" was his name again. He was making her "Baby" feel good. "Baby" was his name. "Yes!"</p> <p>He needed his cock inside her. The love he had felt in the bed since the day he had last seen her was still there. He wanted to fuck it. He wanted to make love to her. He made love to his girlfriend. In that moment, he knew forever and always that when the time came, he would be happy to have taken her as his lover, and be sure to have made love to her.</p> <p>He was fucking his girl. He made love to her. He fucked the day that he was with her. There was no turning back. And if he was the only man on the planet, he would fuck her anytime she wanted him.</p> <p>He was fucking her. He was fucking the day that he had spent the last six months in bed with the man that could finally be hers.</p> <p>"I want you to come with me. Please. I need you baby"</p> <p>"I'm ready"</p> <p>When he was done, he wanted to take his lover. He wanted to be with.</p> <p>He was in love with her.</p> <p>She made sure he was in the place where he wanted to be and with who he wanted to be and in her.</p> <p>"I have never felt this way about anyone in my life. I want you, I want you, I want to be with you. I love you. I want to be with you. I want you to love me"</p> <p>The last of his love for her was his love for himself. The love he felt for her was his joy in being her. It was to be his way to love her. He smiled to himself.</p> <p>"I love you, " he said. It was a statement, not a statement of any thoughtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
