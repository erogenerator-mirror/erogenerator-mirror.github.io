Her breasts were so small they looked like they were going to pop if they weren't still so firm and full and heavy they were still quite pale and still looked pretty cute I said to myself. If I had to guess I would say that she must have had a large amount of makeup on. She looked a bit older and heavier than her body usually and had an even more beautiful and sensual face and a really sexy and exciting look in her eyes. Her lips were thin with just a hint of pink and the eyes really did have that sexy "come fuck me" look that I found so attractive; she could so easily light the way to some pretty gorgeous men if she thought they might be interested in her. It almost seemed more than a little inappropriate to fuck some guys she thought I did not. I could see the lust in her eyes and it made me want to fuck her a lot more.</p> <p>The kiss went on for a long time and she really did start to melt into me and I thought she might actually do something and just say something, but it had been far too long. As we kissed she put one of her hands on my crotch and my cock was getting hard. We finally broke our kiss and she looked down at me with her dark blonde little head in her hand and said, "I have to go and get cleaned up."</p> <p>I took her in my arms and said "I never thought you would take me to the cleaners. I could not stand going back there now"</p> <p>She looked up at me and said "I can't believe you even asked me to clean myself up, because it was after you had done it for me."</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her lips again long and deep as I could. She put her arms around my neck and pulled me down and her lips crushed me and our tongues intertwined. Her hand ran up and down my neck and across my chest and she pressed herself against me tightly and her kiss became much more urgent. The more she kissed me the more intense those lips seemed to be. By the time I felt like I was about to blow in her mouth, she took her hand off my crotch.</p> <p>I looked down at her and she gave me a big smirk and said "that is the last one." I grinned and took those sweet lips back into mine and then kissed her again passionately, our kiss becoming so much more urgent as her hand slipped down and began to stroke and caress my cock through my shorts. She didn't stop her stroking either. It felt fantastic and I put my hands on her head and slowly started to move her more forcefully against me. We broke our kiss again, looked each other in the eye and smiled at each other and then kissed again.</p> <p>We both knew at that point that this kiss was really something special but our kisses were just making each other want to have more and so we broke our embrace and stood and started to walk slowly back to my car.</p> <p>"I have to go and get cleaned up," she said, as if she were trying to put all the effort into getting ready for bed again. Just then a tall, broad shouldered, bald headed stud approached the car and said, "Hi, could I get you a beer again?"</p> <p>I said, "Sure that would be nice." I followed them back and we sat in an empty spot on the side of the house. We talked and laughed for a good minute or so and then I said, "We can talk about that all night."</p> <p>"Sure," she said and I nodded.</p> <p>"So I understand your car, I will drive you home for a surprise."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess that makes it so much better."</p> <p>"It's going to be a lot more fun being the surprise than it first is."</p> <p>A car pulled up on the other side and I walked up to it and got out and opened it as the big stud grabbed his beer like he always did. I noticed him lean over and smile while he said, "I got a message for you from my boss. It was this late and I had no time to come over and do a late lunch."</p> <p>I said to him as I sat down "So there is something I do for my boss"</p> <p>He looked up at me and said "Sure, what's the surprise?"</p> <p>I gave him a big grin and said, "You know the story that I told my wife that I thought was really important."</p> <p>He smiled again as he said back to me "That's fine with me"</p> <p>I reached over and slid into the seat beside him and placed my hand on his thigh and he moved to stand up after he had reached down, but the other driver was still in the street.
