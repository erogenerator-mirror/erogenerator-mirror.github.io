Your new employee is a lovely guy, what can you do for us today?"</p> <p>"My name's Tim, I'm in the IT department with a bunch of techs." He paused to take in the wonderful view of her ass as she walked towards him and said, "But my office is only down the street, I was hoping to see your lovely ass when you got back." "Oh thank you, that would be great," he replied, then looking at his watch and noting the time, said, "I should be home tomorrow." She smiled at him and said, "You know I'm on spring break right?" A short laugh went through his body as he nodded, and she smiled back. After they'd settled in, and had a great meal and had just enough time before the game, they returned to the table with his plate of chips and a couple of beers.</p> <p>When they got back she grabbed her bags and said, "Come on in, we're having a nice night out here." "Oh, I don't know about this," He smiled and looked at her in the eye and said, "It sounds wonderful, I like your company, you're just too perfect." As he put his plate down and she grabbed her stuff as well, she knew that he had no idea she was pregnant by the way he had been staring at her. She smiled at him and said, "It's always good having you around, but I'm not here to talk or cuddle."</p> <p>As soon as they were out of earshot their conversation went back to sports, and soon there was an explosion of words and laughter. They enjoyed their meal when it was over, and then headed home to finish it off at the bar. When they got to his apartment, he kissed her on the cheek saying, "I'd be happy to take you out again tomorrow" and she smiled and said, "Yes, it would be nice to get back here again," and laughed as she added, "I know you'll be here as soon as I get through with this game." He then kissed her quickly on the cheek and grabbed her and pulled her close, "I'm going to make sure every single thing you want is there ready for me whenever I'm here or on the road."</p> <p>"What was that just for?"</p> <p>"Nothing," he smiled, "I just decided that I didn't want that feeling when I came here last night."</p> <p>"I like it when you do that," she said with a giggle.</p> <p>"Do I what?"</p> <p>"Get as close to you as I want," he said. They leaned against each other and smiled. Their kiss was so erotic to say the least. As they kissed, he reached around her and held her ass. He ran his hands up and down her smooth, round ass and said, "I am so thankful that you came to my apartment to tell me that you and Tim are finally making up." He grinned when she laughed and said, "So you're gonna make it up to me?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, you are already all set for the day with your big break."</p> <p>After we finished eating, they sat on the couch together and continued to chat with each other about how they'd been through the break. Both started to lose interest in their conversation, and he smiled and said, "I'm hungry so I guess we'll just order a pizza and some wine. When you're up I'll just leave your phone number on the kitchen counter, will you pick it up ok?" She smiled at him and he nodded and grabbed his keys and wallet and left to get to work.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I'll be ready in a few minutes." They then finished their wine and then headed off to their favorite restaurant. "We'll meet here a few minutes after we eat, I just think we can catch our breath from the excitement and fun of today," she said and smiled. "I'm really glad that you talked me into this, but don't come rushing back, we'll just sit in and enjoy each other's company," she said and looked up smiling and looking into his eyes.</p> <p>"I hope so," he smiled and they laughed together as they reached the restaurant. The restaurant was huge on a day like this, and as they entered the dining room it was filled with everyone. The atmosphere was beautiful, warm and relaxing. The room was filled with people that had just left, all laughing as they sat at tables across from each other. The waiter walked over to greet them as they entered the dining room from the kitchen.
