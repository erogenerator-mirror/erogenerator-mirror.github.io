I looked into his eyes and he smiled. He pulled me to him and gave me a kiss on the lips.</p> <p>"Wow!" he said. "You really were pretty good at that." He took my hand and helped me up into his car as we talked.</p> <p>After Bill left to go back to work I found out that a guy named Jim was paying me a lot of money. He told me he was married but I wasn't interested; I guess he wanted to watch my wife make a movie.</p> <p>Jim told me that his wife was a beautiful young woman and that he watched my wife do the nasty but he always tried to get another customer out of the apartment when the lease was up at first. I just went along with him so he would probably let me watch because of Jim's offer. He said his offer was for $500 each night, $1000 with the door open. He was telling me this was a deal and I really liked him and what he did for a living.</p> <p>What's with all this now?, I thought to myself. I hope the girls at the club were as nice and easy going when we were marriedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
