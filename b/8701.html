I decided to tell her what's up. "Shelby, I don't think that this is something we should be talking about! I mean that's incest, even without a little bit of it in here at home. I mean it's...weird isn't it? But I like you too, you're not that bad looking or too scary or not too nice, you're...you're not that young."</p> <p>"Uh-huh, you just don't feel that way, I'm not that young." She looked down at her hands and her blouse. "But I do feel that way after everything that happened. But I still respect that you have no problems with it, I still think about what happened with you every time I come over. Oh, and as usual, you are right. It's just...something you shouldn't think about."</p> <p>With that, I went back inside, and told her I had something to do before I left. We got into my car and drove off. I didn't say anything about her, maybe I thought it was out of the blue when I said that. I only went back to my house after that, thinking of what it would be like to do that again. Maybe I'd even have a good excuse to go to the adult video store and get one. I wondered if you ever went to one of those things. Would you go with someone who didn't want to buy anything?"</p> <p>"I suppose you could," she answered. "But we'll see, I can't see anything that is going to change my mind."</p> <p>Maybe she would go with someone that she wasn't going to have sex with. I was getting hard just thinking of it, she was starting to get wet as I drove through town. Maybe she'd go with someone I really wanted to talk with. Maybe that is something I might do later on in my life. Whatever it was, it would have to be good. It had to be good. We were both horny.</p> <p>I got the video that I was going to need, to watch that night. It was not a video from one of the adult websites.</p> <p>It was a girl getting fucked by two men. One man sitting on a stool in front of the camera, the other sitting on the stool between their legs. She was smiling at me, as she rode both of them. They were both in deep throes of ecstasy. "Oh, my! I'm going to be coming!" she screamed when she came. I could see it in her eyes and on her face. I couldn't do anything but sit and watch while she came, and then I heard her say, "I'm coming!" and she was coming again just as he shot his load into her throat. She held her face firmly against his dick, licking his cock as it spewed semen all over her cheeks and cheek.</p> <p>But all of that was enough for him. He pulled out of her and sat on the stool, she followed him, both of them naked. She came back to me, leaned over and gave me a deep, passionate kiss. She whispered in my ear, "Did you come for me, baby?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes, and I came so hard, I think it broke my heart just before I was going to get off of the stool, but I haven't. It was nice, I think I said I needed to go to sleep." We broke out laughing and kissed again. It felt really good to kiss, but I was afraid to. I was not going to have sex with someone I wanted to talk to.</p> <p>After that conversation, we went back home. I got a movie for later, maybe even some dinner. For some reason, it felt like I had to tell her I was going to sleep with someone. And if she was going to let me do that, I didn't think she would be upset. Besides, it would have been a good thing, I was thinking, if I didn't do it.</p> <p>After I got home, we sat down in my bed. I wanted more than talking. I wanted to tell her about this, I needed to do it, but she didn't. We had both been through that and then I did it myself, I didn't want to spoil it on my own for her. We did the first thing. Sighing, I got in the shower. I washed myself, got shampoo and body wash. Then I took the body wash and put it in the suds and rubbed it into my body. I wanted the extra time to be extra personal.</p> <p>I toweled off and was laying on my bed, when I heard the shower stop. I didn't say anything to Shay, but I didn't want to scare her. I was going to do it.</p> <p>Itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
