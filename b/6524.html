I groaned, panting. I grabbed the top of his asscheeks, pulling him into me, and fucked him as far into me as I could. He pushed back to meet me as best as he could.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, yeah..." I called out, feeling like I'd run a marathon and I'd just had the best fuck of my life. I felt like I didn't want this to end and I felt as if I would never recover from it all again.</p> <p>I began to pull a little away, trying to stay with his cock and his body. He was getting close, and soon I felt him swell inside me, and he gasped as I felt it start, pushing hard into me, filling me up, making me feel so full.</p> <p>I didn't have a lot of words anymore, but just groaned into the mattress as I felt the spasms ripple through my body. I'd just just experienced another world of pleasure, my pussy clenching around John's cock, holding it like a hand in an earthquake. I was a little bit woozy, but I knew what I was doing was just right to get that effect. My legs were still spasming around their bindings and I was starting to feel a little dizzy.</p> <p>He felt it too, and looked down at me, smiling happily.</p> <p>"Wow, I've had a bit of a rough time these last few days but I still can't believe how good you are." He whispered, looking down at me, his cock still inside me, the spasm running though my body from his cock deep inside me, and making me feel whole again.</p> <p>I didn't bother to reply, instead leaning a little closer to him and giving him an affectionate kiss. I felt a rush, something I'd never felt before in my life, to have a guy kiss me. It was strange. I'd never been kissed after sex, much less blown up with another guy's cum inside me. But this kiss felt different than kissing a man. It was... sensual.</p> <p>He reached around me and took my nipple in his mouth, sucking gently and flicking his tongue on it. His other hand began to stroke my pussy hair, making me twitch slightly.</p> <p>"Oh...." He murmured, letting my nipple go. "You're so beautiful, that was incredible."</p> <p>John began to move inside me, slow and steady. He was stroking my breasts softly, taking care not to make me cum and I was feeling pleasure from his kissing, as he continued rubbing my breast and moving inside me. I kept smiling, enjoying all this.</p> <p>"Hhhrrgg... that feels good, John. Oh, you're so good." I said into his shoulder as he stroked me.</p> <p>He stopped stroking me, making me gasp as another spasm hit.</p> <p>"Oh... you're... insistent." I panted, not really able to speak. "Oh... I don't... need you." I continued weakly.</p> <p>"What do you need?" he asked, looking up at me, his eyes showing me the need that I'd already felt for him.</p> <p>"I want you to be my first." I said. "No... I want to be your first." I added hastily, trying to sound sincere. I saw an idea in his eyes, and I was afraid he might reject me. But he smiled, his face tinged with content and a little twinkles. He didn't mind, he loved seeing me go from being insecure and a little bit shy and submissive to being a lover, a man.</p> <p>"That's a good girl." His eyes say quietly, taking in the words to him. He looked me up and down, loving how I looked in the throes of pleasure.</p> <p>"I'm a virgin, so you'll have to take me," I added cautiously.</p> <p>John grinned. "But that's ok." He paused a pause, feeling excited, enjoying how much he knew how it felt to get a woman to make him hers, how much he trusted her and how much I loved to take care of him. He'd known that long before now, he'd always said that when he had a man. He didn't seem any more shocked than I was that he could make my body feel that good just for a second. Now he'd found an open avenue, opening up the sexual world to him. It wasn't all about whether he'd make me happy or not, but it was always a possibility. I'd let myself feel good about myself once as I'd let the world decide for us. And now, I could feel that kind of happiness again.</p> <p>John slid a finger inside me, curling against my labia and pressing against my opening, making me jumpâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
