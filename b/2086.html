She said after pulling up the dress. "Would you mind taking it home and going to get it tomorrow...?" She said with a smirk.</p> <p>"I don't know if I can do that. I haven't done it since my divorce. I'm going to be alone for a while with my new friend. But I can meet you outside in front of your car. I'm not going to drive anyplace where it's dark tonight."</p> <p>"And you can stay the weekend?" She said, reaching in to untie her pony tail.</p> <p>"Of course not..." She said again with a grin. "How much do you charge for a good time?" She asked, pulling her pony tail free and running her finger down the side of her face. It smelled like mint. She loved the scent of it.</p> <p>"No charge...?" he said with a wide smile, reaching out and grasping her pony tail. He pulled her to him in a tight hug that felt so hot in her wet skin. "Let me do that. I have an idea." He said with a laugh.</p> <p>"And you're going to do anything?" She said with a wide smile. "Well, we'll see."</p> <p>She pulled away from him and ran toward the door then ran back to him as quickly as she'd done before and started undoing the buttons on the front of her dress. He pushed the dress away from her and threw it down his body as she pulled down the zipper. She held his head in her hands as he ran his hands all over her body and finally he had finally freed her breasts from the cups of the bra. He ran his fingers between her breasts and she almost yelped as he found her rock hard nipples pushing her into his hand. When he started to pull the bra off her breasts sprung out at him making him want to do what ever he wanted with them. She moaned as he continued to squeeze her nipples between his fingers. She was leaning against his body just the way she had leaning back against her door. He pulled her legs apart and kissed the inside of her thigh then kissed around and around her wet pussy. He put his mouth on her and ran his tongue around her lips then over her clit making her cry out in pleasure. He continued to fuck her with his tongue making her cum so much that she came once more then rolled on top of him forcing his hard cock deep into her again just as she had done.</p> <p>"Oh fuck...that... is so good..." She said with her head thrown back with her long lashes fluttering.</p> <p>"You like watching me?" He asked as he put her on her knees.</p> <p>"Mmm...yes sir." She replied leaning forward and placing her hands on his legs. She ran her hands up his toned leg and he shivered at the feel of her fingers tracing his legs. She reached the top of his thigh reaching the elastic of his boxers then grabbed his rock hard cock as she knelt next to him on the large bed. Her fingers worked under the elastic until her hand slid around his cock, stroking up and down as one hand continued to work his cock with the other. He was already hard and she could feel the hot flesh pressing into her palm as she held it upright. As she pumped her hand up and down he closed his eyes and moaned. She looked back towards his face and saw him trying to catch his breath. His eyes opened as they returned to hers and she smiled gently as she looked back at his face.</p> <p>"You have a gorgeous cock sir...." she said softly.</p> <p>"Yes I like it too." He answered with a smile.</p> <p>"I love it when you call me Sir." she said with a grin.</p> <p>"I guess that makes me the Sir then?" He asked giving her a little smile.</p> <p>She laughed. "Yes sir." She answered leaning forward again and kissing his inner thigh, then taking his cock again and slipping both hands up and holding the hard flesh inside his boxers. She was looking at his cock and she could see the veins running along the shaft making it look even harder and longer. She looked up at him and he started to moan so she got up. She straddled his thighs then slowly pulled her skirt up to her waist as she slid one hand inside the other and pressed her fingers against his soft pink skin. She was wearing no underwear so she slowly slid her fingers up the outside of his cock then slowly down the middle finding his balls. She teased him for a short time then slid off.</p> <p>"I know just what you would like." She said sliding down his body, kissing his chest and moving down his stomach.
