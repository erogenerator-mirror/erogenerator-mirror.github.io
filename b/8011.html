Fuck Me."</p> <p>I got up between her legs, and pulled the top of her dress open, exposing her breasts as I continued fucking her. She was already moaning as I took in the sight of her nude, aroused body. She was definitely a woman, as I'd seen many times before. Her skin shimmered beneath the light.</p> <p>"Fucking you," I whispered, as she reached down and took hold of my hands and slowly guided them to her breasts, then back to my cock. "I want to see you," I whispered, as I took hold of her hair and brought my mouth down on hers and began to suck on her tongue. My hand went down to the juncture of her legs, and I could feel the heat and moisture there as I slowly massaged her clit with my fingers. She groaned with delight as I pulled her pussy hard against my throbbing dick, and she moaned in pleasure as the tip of my tongue found the hard bud of her clit, and then she moaned again.</p> <p>"Fuck Me!" Her voice sounded muffled by my cock between her legs, but I could feel an orgasm building in the pit of my loins. I pulled her hips back toward me on the bed as I plunged my finger into her pussy, making her cry out and arch her back. With one hand on the back of her neck, I lifted her head up to my mouth for a kiss as I fucked her with my fingers, while using my other hand to rub her clit as I sucked on her lips. She tasted sweet on my lips, and I was tempted to lick more of her, but I kept my mouth locked on hers in a passionate kiss, as she wrapped her legs around me and pulled me against her.</p> <p>"Fuck Me!" she practically shouted from the feel of herself wrapped around me, but that had an effect as I increased the speed and strength of my thrusts inside of her. I reached back, grabbed her by the ankles, and flipped her over so I could continue giving her clit the loving strokes it deserved. She was panting, almost growling, and her body was thrashing between me and the bed as I took her body.</p> <p>"Do it!" she demanded, pulling her head to one side. "Breath in! Do it!"</p> <p>She was now leaning further back as her breathing quickened, and her body bucked against my hips and made a sound of pleasure that sounded like a mixture of pleasure and pain that was as natural to her as it was for me. I could feel her pussy contracting hard around my throbbing erection as I kept my mouth locked on hers, kissing and licking her with all the lust I could muster. She had her hands on my ass as my cock began to piston in and out of her, and I lifted her legs up and wrapped them behind me, lifting my weight on her, pulling her up with me...I could feel the muscles of her thighs spasm as she reached behind me to play with my ass, and as we moved faster and harder with each passing second, she cried out, "More," and pressed herself hard against me.</p> <p>Suddenly, she grabbed my ass even farther, pulling me down on her as she cried out, "Fuck me!" and again I complied, knowing full well that I would be coming first. I was in deep, deep, and long, and as she screamed in satisfaction, I felt myself cum inside of her, filling her to overflowing, and I continued to thrust against her until my shaft had subsided and I finally let myself go.</p> <p>She collapsed atop me and pulled at my fingers, and then rolled herself on her side, with her head near mine. I could see the passion returning and the color returning to her face as we basked in the post-orgasmic glow of my orgasm. She turned toward me and smiled.</p> <p>"I've wanted this for so long," she said. "Let's go find a hotel, where we can fuck while we're here, for real."</p> <p>I wasn't sure if she was aware of this time, of her desire for sex, of how she'd been taking it since the night we'd been in bed. I took in a deep breath as the thought of being with her now again was pushing me.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked. I wasn't certain, but I was hopeful.</p> <p>She smiled, and kissed my cheek. "I've thought about it before. Just think that," she kissed my neck. "I'm as sure as I've ever been that I want to be with you."</p> <p>I nodded and we both lay back, with her leg across my hip. She smiled as she felt safe and satisfied with me, and I smiled back. I had dreamed of this moment too, and I was hoping itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
