We have this room. We could be friends. Or we could be lovers. I'd let you sleep where you'd wake me up if you ever wanted to. And I don't bite!"</p> <p>I didn't even hesitate. I picked her up and gave her a kiss so hard I thought I might break a bone in my right shoulder. "I know that sounds strange, but I want to be with you." I grabbed her and I kissed her so hard it hurt and it made her tongue touch mine, make me feel like we were connected.</p> <p>"Oh my god that was fucking amazing! I've never been so safe in my life!" She ran toward the bed and I followed in a flash. I dropped her. "You're so strong and strong and you make me feel so safe and protected!" I took her in my arms again kissing her. Again, we were lost in the moment, with the taste of her on my lips and tongue still on my cheek and nose. "I love you" she whispered.</p> <p>"I know," I said, giving her a brief hug as we fell asleep.</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>I woke up to her kissing me. I looked around to make sure that this was all a dream. I thought it was the best sleep I'd had in a long time, but it didn't even begin to cover it! Her lips were like butterfly wings, soft and passionate and her mouth was full and inviting. I felt like I'd just run a marathon with these two. I pulled away from the embrace, looking at her, she smiled and I did too. She ran her fingertips over my chest down to my erectness and I could feel every inch of her. She took hold of the belt on my robe, pulling me up against her belly and started to kiss up and down my body all the way down, as she went.</p> <p>I could feel the warmth of her body against me as she pulled me down to the edge of the bed. There were no rules in my life, other than that I would sleep with her tonight. Our kissing started again, but this time, not with the passion that would happen with a passionate man. Her lips moved in and kissed my lips and I could taste the traces of coffee and coffee that had been left behind. Her hands moved to my belt as our tongues explored each other, and my arms reached up to hold down her body to mine. She broke our kiss long enough to unhitch her robe and lift it over her head. We looked into each other's eyes and I couldn't help but feel a tingle course through my heart. The feel of her body against mine was indescribable. Her body was so beautiful, she was so soft in my arms and it was as wonderful as before. Her hips were so wonderfully curved and the scent of her was intoxicating to my nostrils. I kissed her on the neck and down to the line of her throat and I felt my heart pounding. Her hair was a beautiful silky brown that hung in little droplets over her shoulder blades and then down to her front. It had a sheen of her own and I ran my hands over her body to knead the muscles so wonderfully. I pushed up off the covers and ran my tongue over the soft, smooth skin there. Her breathing was almost audible to me as she made tiny little sounds as she sucked my tongue into her mouth.</p> <p>I knew I wouldn't last long inside of her and I didn't want to stop. I wanted just to feel her naked skin against mine. I wanted to hold her tight and kiss her and taste and feel everything that we both felt. But as quickly as it came to an end, it didn't stop. She broke our kiss, looked at me and said, "This should be a surprise! I'll shower and you'll have to join me!" I knew it was and I was only too happy to join her. Her shower with her was incredible. She was amazing. What a difference a shower from sleeping with him. We stood there taking the shower head off the wall and then I joined her under the spray. I had to say that she was an amazing woman. She'd been with a husband who didn't have that kind of relationship with their sex life. He had a wonderful life, he told her, but she had to know that a relationship was something for his own and she had no experience with another woman's body. They had sex all the time, but he never was satisfied with just one or two. He always felt obligated to give her as many orgasms as she gave him. When he wasn't going to do anything more than fuck her, she just had to do everything and he was good at that!</p> <p>We stayed under the water after we toweled off and she stepped out of the shower. She wrapped a towel around herself and thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
