Maybe I can tell you exactly what to do."</p> <p>I smile, "Sure."</p> <p>She turns away and gets up off the bed to get my towel so she can dry my chest. "It's ok, I'll hang on to it."</p> <p>I stand up and look for my pants on the floor, they're still in a heap on the bathroom counter. I grab them and pull them on, I'm hoping to catch her by surprise.</p> <p>"Don't forget to do your hair and make sure you wipe your ass nice and nice."</p> <p>I put my hands on my forehead and groan. I know she noticed, but I can't look at her for more than just a few seconds in case. It hurts too much to face the world, even if that means I'll only see her for a couple hours as my excuse to walk down the hall to my room.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>I walk down the hall and into my bedroom. I hear her humming happily but as much as I'm trying not to make noise, my mind goes blank. She says hello as she hangs up my towel, looks up at me with such love and awe that I can't help myself from dropping my pants again as I walk by her, my dick bouncing in front of me.</p> <p>"So... you got any plans for this evening?" she asks me.</p> <p>"I decided to skip the party tomorrow and be by myself with my friends, but today was so much better than any other..."</p> <p>She looks up and we stare at each other, she's as beautiful as ever, and her eyes are blue, which isn't the golden color her mom gives her.</p> <p>"So... what's the plan?" she asks.</p> <p>"I was thinking that I'd just sit at the table naked, but I don't think a proper dress should do that, especially with my clothes on. I don't know if I should go through with it... not yet anyway. Maybe we should go for something nice... something like we've talked about... I know it sounds crazy... I could still do that, but I think I know that. It's going to hurt if I don't."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure. That'd be great." I say, hoping she thinks that's what I'm asking her to do.</p> <p>"I don't want you to leave the room." she replies.</p> <p>"I don't either, but why not?"</p> <p>"Because it's so nice." she responds.</p> <p>"Well... ok."</p> <p>"And... what else do you think is going to be nice?"</p> <p>"Maybe we can find something fun to do." I reply, then she says: "I just might do that too."</p> <p>"Let me know when." I answer. I walk into my room and grab my books, a few more things. Just then the doorbell rings. I walk back to the bathroom to answer it.</p> <p>"Hey, you're on your way home, right? And..."</p> <p>"...it's ok, I love your accent."</p> <p>"Of course you do."</p> <p>I reach in the bathroom and put the lock on the door, then quickly grab a towel and wrap it around myself. As I put my things in the laundry room, I notice her door is the same as before. I smile at this as I grab a spare set of clothes to throw out with me and head out the door.</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>I'm on the elevator back to my room when I notice the door to the bathroom has already closed when I pull my towel out from underneath it and look. Oh shit. I'm not even in the kitchen, so I'm actually in the shower! I quickly push all my stuff into the laundry room and shut the door, only opening it a crack when I hear the shower stop. I'm actually in a hurry to get out myself, so I close the door and start taking my clothes off myself.</p> <p>I get my last set of clothes out of the closet, I also grabbed my razor and my razor blades, which I quickly put into the laundry bags and placed on the counter to the bottom of the sink. I walk out to the bathroom and grab her new towel, she seems so excited that I just have to hold it when she reaches to me to pick it.</p> <p>"Just don't touch me here, okay?" she says as the towel is placed neatly on the counter. "Let's go..."</p> <p>I don't let go of hers, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
