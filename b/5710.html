"Come closer."</p> <p>She did.</p> <p>The hand pulled her towards the bed and then she felt a tug at the side of her wrist. It tugged her hand forwards and felt the restraints tighten as she got the other hand secured to a chair. Another tug on her ankle.</p> <p>"I think she's ready." he said.</p> <p>He climbed on the bed and stood before her. He removed his shirt.</p> <p>"Show me how much you do love her."</p> <p>She felt him pulling the straps. The hands slowly eased down her legs until they were holding her up by her ankles. Slowly he pulled the gown up the soft flesh of her legs until her body was exposed. She felt hands on her thighs sliding upwards.</p> <p>He moved his fingers under the gown until he reached the mound between her legs. She felt him slide his fingers over the lips. She gasped.</p> <p>"Let me do you." he whispered.</p> <p>He lifted her legs so he could slide both her knees under the edge of the mattress before pulling the gown up her legs until it was covering her body. Slowly he pulled it up until the slit on her pussy was covered from the waist up. She felt herself being lifted slightly off the bed before she felt his mouth begin to kiss it.</p> <p>"Oh." She moaned at the feel of his tongue licking the lips of her pussy. The sensations continued between her legs. She felt herself lifting again as she felt his tongue slide out from between her legs. Her ass lifted off the bed when he took the head of his cock between her legs.</p> <p>"Oh..oh.."</p> <p>He stopped at the base of the head of his cock and began to push in.

"Stop." she whispered.</p> <p>He felt that small movement and felt a surge. She stopped even though she wanted to start again.</p> <p>"I love this." he murmured.</p> <p>She pushed back at him. His cock slid deeper in her body. With every breath his cock made, he continued to sink in until he was resting deep inside her. He kept pushing until they both stopped breathing.</p> <p>"Oh my god." she moaned.</p> <p>He slid his hands forward. He pulled the gown up and off her body. He placed both hands on the sides of her face. She pulled her body up as she moaned. When she started pushing back at him he pulled her back as he slid his hands through her hair and pulled her towards his mouth.</p> <p>She moaned a strangled moan of love and desire when he started licking her clit. Then the feeling of her body began to move as he sucked on her clit. Her hips moving back at his. Her body thrusting back towards his mouth. She knew it wouldn't take more and it wasn't. Just as she thought she couldn't do anything else she felt him thrust deep. As he began filling her body she felt the first spurt of his cum. She shuddered as she felt him pump his cum into her body. Then it was over.</p> <p>He slowly moved his body so he was lying next to her on the bed.</p> <p>"Was I worth the wait?"</p> <p>"You were, just wait." she told himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
