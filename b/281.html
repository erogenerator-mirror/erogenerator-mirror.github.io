I agreed.</p> <p>"I think we can agree to talk about any ideas we have as the day progresses."</p> <p>We looked on the patio and the three of us could now see that the pool and Jacuzzi had been closed and the two men were sitting at the edge of the pool and I'd been listening to what they were saying. They weren't actually talking about much but seemed to be listening to each other's words.</p> <p>I turned to Mary and said, "Mary, do you mind if I give you a little more information? Just to be clear I have no idea what your ideas are on this subject."</p> <p>"Sure, but why don't you come up with a few questions as they are all important to you?"</p> <p>My mind raced as I wondered how I'd be able to describe the conversation as it was and how I would feel in my mind, the subject would be clear and it would feel to me like it was a sexual awakening.</p> <p>"Mary, that is a lot to ask and I'm still a bit hesitant that it might come out wrong but I'm sure it can be put to good use now."</p> <p>Mary laughed and put her hand on my leg and said," You know Mary, if you don't do something it won't change anything you have already done. Do you think this will be as good as you think?"</p> <p>I looked over at Steve and he turned around and said, "No, I guess not. I've thought a lot about this and I can see that we are all in agreement."</p> <p>"Let me try this out," Mary said and lifted my leg, her hand slipped up to caress me a bit as she pulled up my dress, she ran her fingers lightly across my bare pussy and then she touched my nipple. "I think I'm going to love this," she stated and went back to caressing me and I just went along with her little touches, it felt great.</p> <p>The idea seemed to make me hot, but at the same time it was so strange to be so turned on, I wanted the night to go on as we would need to wait and talk to Steve if we decided to be adventurous that night. I wondered how his reaction to it would be, my first thought was that maybe he wouldn't say anything.</p> <p>Steve said, "I've been watching Mary for a long time, and that's probably the most interesting thing about her."</p> <p>"I just wanted to see if you'd consider joining us." I responded.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm sure that would be fun so we'd both like to try it with you." I had already been talking to Mary about wanting to have a threesome with Steve but I was surprised by how much easier it had made it for me. After we were through I had to admit that this had been more exciting than the time with Steve, but if Steve was saying something really hot I knew he was enjoying the conversation.</p> <p>We all just sat and watched the couples for a while. As soon as Mary had Steve's interest level down I had a thought and said it. "Mary, do you think you'd be OK with it if Steve and I had this thing?"</p> <p>"I think so. I think we need to be open with them before we go any further," Mary replied.</p> <p>"Don't you think we should take things a little slow?" I asked.</p> <p>Mary looked me in the eye and then nodded her head and said, "I think Steve and I can handle anything this happens to us. If Steve wasn't so wound up and all of us going forward like this wouldn't feel so terrible."</p> <p>"I agree with you on that," Steve said.</p> <p>Mary smiled and looked at me and then back to her husband and said, "Steve, are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"Of course, let's do it!" I said enthusiastically.</p> <p>"OK, Mary, I'm telling you that Steve and you really should be able to handle this if we would do things this way." Steve and I turned towards my husband. "Steve, take Mike with you, we need to sit on the edge of the chair and watch this go by. We'd better take that up with Mary because Steve will just go back to being a spectator now." Steve took my hand and I slipped to the chair and sat on the edge and spread my legs invitingly.</p> <p>Steve stood by the chair and as his wife sat on the edge of the chair he moved her skirt up to uncover her lovelyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
