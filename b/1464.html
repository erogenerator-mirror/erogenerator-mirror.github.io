"Nothing bad will happen to you. You just have to accept it." I gave her a kiss and then moved back to the middle of the room behind Mike and Jason. They sat in silence and looked over their hands as they talked.</p> <p>Jasmine had a little smile on her face and I thought she was ready to get going. "We do have another surprise for you to discover!" I said.</p> <p>"What's that?" Jason asked.</p> <p>"My parents have a special trip in California the next June."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>Jasmine paused and looked at him. "We have plans in September to go to Vegas and spend a week in California." She looked up at Jason and I.

"I hope you don't mind," she said with a smile. "But we have the entire weekend away and neither one of us are allowed to leave unless I say we want something." She dropped her gaze to Mike and I turned slightly to see her look over at Jason and then back at Jasmine. Jasmine had one hand in her lap and one hand in my lap. She had that grin on her face and she looked over at me with that same look and took a step back.</p> <p>"What?" I asked looking at Jason. "I've been waiting for this weekend."</p> <p>Jasmine slowly stood up and walked to me. She stepped to me. "Come. It's been too long!" She pushed me gently toward the door and closed it shut behind us as Jason backed away taking my hands from my beltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
