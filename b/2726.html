She sounded surprised when she said it and not for that very obvious reason. She was going to feel better about being naked in front of me, if only for a while. And my nipples were as well. She liked that.</p> <p>My first slow stroke of the towel was more like a caress. After only an hour I began to work up her torso, to her breasts, and then back down, where I did manage to get the towel to brush her pubic hair.</p> <p>"That feels nice, Tom." She let go of my cock, and I stepped toward her. A couple of inches had disappeared between her legs, but she didn't try to stop me. I leaned in to kiss her again, and she wrapped her legs around me.</p> <p>"Let me do it more...here." She was very light-skinned, and her skin was just as soft. She reached under herself with her other hand and held my dick against her belly.</p> <p>I worked lower, and felt her hand slide over my thigh a few degrees before she pulled me back into it. I felt her fingers slide back over my head, and then go again, just like my dick had. We were both breathless when she moved my hand up to her breast and said, "Feel for yourself."</p> <p>"Oh!" Now I'd almost forgotten about the nipple, but this was a good time to hold it between my thumb and forefinger. She looked surprised, and smiled in response. When the feel of my finger on her nipple had made her jump, she pulled me back into her and said, "Now?"</p> <p>"Yes, but it's okay now, if you like."</p> <p>"Good. I like it. Like what?" She'd already rolled over on her side, and had lifted her leg to look at me.</p> <p>"Like your pussy. I think I got a lot more in here." And then she went to start again, but stopped at the top of the last line, when all she really wanted was to get the rest. And I could have got another five minutes.</p> <p>She gave my dick another squeeze, and then asked, "You ready for this?"</p> <p>"For what?" She was grinning again.</p> <p>"Now you."</p> <p>"I know...but I don't have one of these things to use." She gave my dick the same treatment before we left the kitchen, though without any underwear on.</p> <p>"What's up with these?"</p> <p>"They're on a dresser drawer." My own, of course! I wondered, briefly, whether this could be done for me. Or even my wife, because what happened to my wife once I went to bed, and what I got this time, I didn't have a clue. But, I guess, that wasn't an important consideration at this point. She did the same thing for me...and then went back to my cock, taking it in again.</p> <p>"Let me feel for myself," she said, looking toward me. Then she gave it another squeeze. "Don't expect any luck," she said. I felt the warm, soft body press on mine in another move, and knew that she'd had a breast in each hand, and her other nipple was also in the same spot. I knew she'd wanted to stroke me, to feel the pressure of my dick in her hand, and to stroke her nipple. But my hand wasn't as big. I was already in trouble as far as being in this position could go, but she'd still gotten it the first time.</p> <p>I pulled my hand back, and she used my dick to slide it up and down her belly, and to cup and feel. I knew when she'd gotten close to her first set of boobs, when the feel alone started to make her shake in nervousness, that I'd be close to finishing.</p> <p>"Oh!" and then she went back to her first stroke. The second stroke. "A little warmer, Tom, but you'll get there."</p> <p>I could picture her breasts. "This is nice. How long have you been here?"</p> <p>"Oh...well, about fifteen minutes. Maybe a few more minutes," she said. "How do you feel?"</p> <p>"I feel kind of funny..."</p> <p>"Not to worry, Tom. It just got warmer, and I'm sure you'll do just fine. You're just going to have to hold out, and not push it away so early."</p> <p>"That you're sure?"</p> <p>"I'm sure. Let's get on with it then."</p> <p>So she turned her backside to me and began to move itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
