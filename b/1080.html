Besides, I don't know. It's kind of complicated right?"</p> <p>"What's more complicated than talking about you and your friends?"</p> <p>I told her that it was complicated, and I had some friends from a previous relationship, but she wasn't even around, and so why change the subject? I took her hand and we went home, and then my parents went to their room and we sat down in their den.</p> <p>"When we were at home for the first time in our relationship, I talked with Mom all the way through, and after that we had tons of time to talk, and we talked most of the day, then Mom got home from work, then Dad."</p> <p>I could tell, not all guys could talk with that body of theirs, "Oh yeah." I said.</p> <p>"That's why we became best friends now. It's just something we both needed and we agreed, so I'm sorry if I embarrassed you..."</p> <p>"No, don't be. It's not a problem."</p> <p>We sat there for a couple of minutes before she started blushing, "Are you sure? That was embarrassing."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. Mom is just a little old for your age. I was 19 when she got pregnant, Dad is older, and a lot more mature..."</p> <p>"You know, you could be a lot older."</p> <p>"I wish. My mom, my dad, is so much older than I am."</p> <p>"It's not bad if you look at her, 'cause he's so cool."</p> <p>I got a big laugh out of that remark, and when I said she had a really great figure, she giggled again, "Oh, I know Dad loves to play tennis."</p> <p>I think that's why I was able to tell my parents something so simple. I knew they would know what it was, 'cause she hadn't even said a word or even had enough wine for her to blush.</p> <p>Mom just looked for a moment, then looked up at me and smiled.</p> <p>We were quiet for a while until Mom said something that she didn't understand. "So what are you going to do?"</p> <p>I decided to do something. I leaned in over and kissed her on the lips, then my lips left hers, and my dick just kind of twitched.</p> <p>"Come in the den, we can talk a bit."</p> <p>"Ok. There is a box of tissues in the back, and I know you have a lot of stuff we need to take care of tomorrow anyways."</p> <p>She smiled, and we went back to getting ready for bed. We were on the brink of making love in a little while, but there was a good chance Mom wasn't going to take care of us. I felt like she would find ways to humiliate me.</p> <p>So with my underwear still on, I went back to my bedroom and got my vibrator. I turned it on low so I could just play around with it. The vibration felt nice when I pushed it in and it felt great when I pushed it out. I knew she would be excited and she was definitely interested. When she didn't say anything, I went back to my house with my vibrator, and I started the vibrator over her body, starting slow and enjoying the vibrations with lots of foreplay. As I was doing that, I decided to do something new.</p> <p>"I'm going to put this in your pussy." I said.</p> <p>She looked at me while I said it. I could see that she was really interested in what I was about to do, and I could also tell that she liked it.</p> <p>"Yeah..."</p> <p>"Yeah, just turn it on, and put it in. I want to hear it vibrate your pussy."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"It's for my girlfriend. It's all for you. And if you feel like you're too anxious to do it, turn it off, and I want to do it for you, ok?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess so."</p> <p>"Turn it off, now. I don't want you to get excited." I was trying to play as cool as I could, but we both knew it would get me in trouble, and if she said something, I'd probably kill her, so I wanted to stay in charge and not do it."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>"Now put it in," I said.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She turned it on and pushed it in, not much, but it felt great to me. At that point, I was about to turn the vibrator off so I could getâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
