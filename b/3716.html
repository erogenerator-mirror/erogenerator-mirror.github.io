She didn't bother to lay on the lounge chair to do the swim. The look on her face told me there was not a drop of water left floating on the beach. That alone tipped me over the edge. She took a deep breath, relaxed and closed her eyes, letting the warm water wash away the salt and sand under her eyes.</p> <p>I walked to the pool and went inside so I could get my water. There was nobody else in the water as I got out to fill it.</p> <p>When I got back, Carol was floating in the water next to me. She had just enough time to remove her bikini top before my rock hard erection was fully engorged inside her soaking wet love canal.</p> <p>"You need to lay on your stomach," I said. "I have to get back in from the beach so we can clean up."</p> <p>Then she sat up, pulled my head to her chest, and we kissed and kissed for several long minutes. Then she pulled my head to her chest and kissed my ear.</p> <p>"You know, now that I think of it, maybe there are more things for us to do before we go back home."</p> <p>"You better put your bikini back on," I cautioned.</p> <p>"I want to take it off as soon as you come back out," she said, grinning. "I want to see you again."</p> <p>I got my bathing suit from the lounge chair and sat it down on the patio table. The day was not very hot, even for Carol. I put on my shorts and a T-shirt and lay back on the lounge chair. She came and picked up her bikini top and took the bikini off. Then the bikini was back on and she put the one she was wearing on over her bikini top. By this time her nipples were very clearly visible as she tossed her bikini top to me. Then she did something unexpected. She leaned over and kissed me. Her nipples pressed hard into my chest as our tongues dueled in the hot kiss. It took a couple of seconds, but everything was right. My erect cock was straining to be released from the confines of my swim shorts. Finally Carol stopped our kiss and pulled the bikini off my head and put it on the ground.</p> <p>"It's still cold," she said, stepping away from me. "Here, let me help you put your shorts on so you don't get cold again."</p> <p>As I started to step out of the pool, she put a chair next to mine as she pulled them on. I pulled them down and she sat. Then our feet went next to the lounge chair as she held her bikini bottom in front of her pussy. I could see moisture on her pussy lips. By this time she had a full smile on her face as she looked over to see my reaction.</p> <p>"Is that better? Is it better because it's the cold water?" she asked, looking directly into my eyes.</p> <p>I was totally speechless, staring her down and seeing her as our eyes locked on each other. I could tell she felt the same way as she leaned forward and kissed me very softly on the lips. Her lips pressed against mine. I could feel the lips pressing against my tongue as her lips opened, allowing my tongue to enter deeply. The kiss began slowly, becoming more passionate with each passing moment. Our tongues began flicking from time to time.</p> <p>Finally Carol broke our kiss to look into my eyes for a reaction. I saw that she had her hands on her breasts and was squeezing them through her bikini top as she gazed out at me. With a devilish smile on her face she got up and walked into the house, leaving me naked in the pool as she went. The sound of laughter from the door to the house came from upstairs as we came in to the family room to find Carol laying on her back, naked, on top of the armchair.</p> <p>"That was terrific. I love you so much!" she exclaimed with a long, deep sigh as she settled down on the other armchair. "You really know how to turn a light bulb on."</p> <p>As the laughter continued, she looked up at me and smiled. "You really don't want us to have sex do you?"</p> <p>I nodded. "No, not really. I think I'll go back to sleep. I'm very excited about tonight, even though it's a little early for me to have my first time."</p> <p>With that she slowly got off the chair and reached over to take my shorts and underwear off. I had on nothing underneath as I took my shoes from the other chair.</p> <p>"Come on," she said as she pulled me quickly to the bedroom. I lay there in the darkness for about a minute as she walked behind me and pulled down my shorts and underwear.
