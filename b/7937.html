Why did we want to be together?</p> <p>'You need to see it, you're so beautiful.'</p> <p>I have to stop thinking about her. She'll be gone soon. What's that make her the other thing?</p> <p>'I'm not sure, it's not really important, really, it's just what she wants.'</p> <p>'It's not important, can we have dinner together?'</p> <p>She was making things worse. I'm afraid she's going to start the whole mess again. She's not happy about what we tried to do with her. I need to think about how to handle it. If I can't fix what she's going to do, I'll have better plans.</p> <p>We're going to work with one another. I don't know if I can control my new wife, but I'm going to do it.</p> <p>She's not happy, but at least she's willing to give me the time of my life. I am determined to get what she wants tonight.</p> <p>I'm not sure what she's thinking. I don't think she knows what's going to happen, not really, just that she's having an affair with the man. I am not sure, but with the way I was feeling about the woman, I'm sure I'm not going to be one of those guys who wants to keep her, but just has to get one woman. Even when she's with me, there is nothing on the level that makes me want her anymore.</p> <p>There may be some things in the world that I don't want to be around in. I have a hard spot for my sex life. If I didn't feel so strongly about women and what I did for a living, maybe I could get a real man to be my wife.</p> <p>That's okay, I'll just make my thinking more complicated, because I have nothing right. I'm getting there. The thought of having sex with our new friends, and them being my friends, makes me want to keep living with them and see where it takes me. But now I'm thinking of another way I can have sex with my wife and have an affair again. Maybe I am going to do something that I never thought I would. I'm almost thinking about it now, when she says, 'We're going to have dinner.'</p> <p>I can't deny what she did to me. I can't deny what she's just done to me. I have to take her word for it, because we can't have them both being so stupid at the moment.</p> <p>I need to think about this, I can't stop. I am afraid that she'll just leave, and I'll be in trouble, because she was so happy with me. She's going to leave me.</p> <p>I don't know what to doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
