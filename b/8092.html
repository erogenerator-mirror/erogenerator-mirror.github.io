"I thought you could say no to me, to my mother. You think your mother can keep it from me? If we're married, we're not in the right position." You put it on the counter, which was in front of the sink.</p> <p>You reached for the washcloth and began lathering the soap, then your face. "You were right on that one. I can see what I'm doing to you. You haven't been sleeping like this for two days."</p> <p>"What else is there?"</p> <p>"I think your mother's been a very good wife."</p> <p>"Momma's a good little housewife."</p> <p>"She's got three great kids. This is my chance at a great life." You stood, holding the washcloth out to me.</p> <p>"Don't ask me to do it. There's lots to do before our anniversary."</p> <p>"When the night is through, don't be surprised. But I don't have to get dressed this soon."</p> <p>You picked up the towel and began to dry off. When you were done, you picked up the washcloth and said, "What did I say?"</p> <p>I took the washcloth from your hand and looked at you. "Just because I can't think of anything else to say, doesn't mean I want to get dressed tonight."</p> <p>"I thought not. You're my little girl and I don't want you to think your mother will behave." Then you turned on your heel and left.</p> <p>I could hear your mother's and your father's laughter just before you closed the door. My heart was racing.</p> <p>"Don't think I'm going to let things go far," I whispered to myself. "I'd like to see if..."</p> <p>A few days after the anniversary party, I bought a new dress and began dressing in it. The dress was very sexy. I had to admit it made my stomach lurch. I pulled into the valet parking and looked around. The parking attendant must have been the driver. I looked back to see that he was giving a thumbs up.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." He stepped back and watched as I drove off, down the street. The valet looked back at me with a grin and I waved him off. I got out of the car and took an ordinary white shirt that was a light summer summer. I looked in the mirror and saw a little smirk on my lips.</p> <p>You arrived just then, wearing a soft white knit sweater.</p> <p>We sat down and began chatting. After a while, a thought occurred to me. "What if you could have a second date with me this evening?" The thought occurred to me, as you were making a light dinner for yourselves. I wondered if I'd make a good meal for myself. For one thing, you didn't have enough money to make your own supper.</p> <p>"Well, since I'm not having a second date, at least that's a reasonable possibility." I smiled up at you.</p> <p>"It would be nice to have another chance to see you."</p> <p>"Really, now that's a bit much for me."</p> <p>"I'll be just right for you," you teased and leaned in to kiss me. I pulled a little back. "Is the table ready, please?" You got up from the table and followed me to my car. "No, that's just not necessary." I smiled at you and kissed you again.</p> <p>Just then, the front door opened and I saw you.</p> <p>"Who the hell is that?"</p> <p>I saw your eyes on my face and knew you could see right through me. I knew your eyes were glancing down my dress. I knew it was the same sight that you'd always looked. I smiled and closed the door.</p> <p>"I'm home, sweetie." You leaned close to me. "I've missed you."</p> <p>I kissed you. "I'm home too." We stood kissing before I turned and walked to the door.</p> <p>"Are you leaving?" You asked. I walked down the hall and walked into your bedroom, where there was another door. Opening the door, I saw that the lights were off and your bed and bath were on. Standing in the middle of the room, my eyes wandered over each of the rooms that you had made their own place in. All of them were beautiful.</p> <p>"I'm home, honey," I said to you from the closet. You turned to see me come into the bathroom and put your arms around my neck. "How did you sleep?" You had been watching me all night as you got dressed.</p> <p>"You're the prettiest girl I've ever seen.
