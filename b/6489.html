She smiled gently. "And I'd like to eat your pussy. Would you like that?" she asked, teasing her fingers across his chin and over his lips. He nodded. Then, taking his hand, he pushed it on the small of her back, leading her towards the bedroom. He helped her on the bed as she lay back and he leaned forward to kiss her tenderly. She responded instantly, her lips parting for him, and she moaned softly. They lay there for long moments, their lips moving slowly. Her breasts began to heave against his fingers as she moved her hips forward, and his hand moved to caress the full softness of her inner thighs.</p> <p>With a deep sigh, she slid to the head of the bed. He slid to the side, pulling her gently so he could kiss her once more.</p> <p>He began to kiss her again, slowly and sensuously. She held her breath as he kissed her, then began to kiss his way down her body, stopping at her breasts for a moment to suckle one. His fingers pulled on the nipple, then began to slide down her belly to play with her pubic-line. He slid his fingers into her wetness, moving to her clit to slide two fingers inside her. He licked her, moving to her clit until he felt it start to engorge. He pressed his body down so that he could continue on his way down, then back up to lick and flick her clitoris. She began to move against his face even as her body writhed in pleasure. Then, as her body became more aroused, she pushed up against his mouth, begging him to eat her until she screamed and came for him. He obliged. Licked her, sucked on her, and as she continued to wriggle in sexual delight, he felt his own body responding to his ministrations. He slid two fingers inside her, then began to stroke himself rhythmically. His tongue moved expertly around her erect clit. He watched her, watching her body as she writhed around on his fingers before him, knowing how she would orgasm.</p> <p>Her face was flushed, her body twisting in pleasure at his touch. His tongue pressed against her, drawing her clit in to press against and against his tongue. She cried out in a throaty moan. As she cried, he inserted two fingers inside her, moving them in and out. As she began to orgasm, his tongue, his fingers, and inside her pussy, his tongue and inside her exploded in another powerful orgasm.</p> <p>As her pleasure passed, he withdrew his fingers and moved to lie alongside her. He kissed her deeply, and moved his hands onto her breasts, rolling her nipples between finger and thumb, then slid between her legs, touching her in more intimate places than her vagina and anus. He slid the finger of his other hand inside her, making her moan. Then, kissing her softly, he began touching her lips with his own tongue, and moving his finger around inside her, he sucked on her clit, and she screamed until she came again.</p> <p>She moved to lie beside him. He was on his back, head on her thigh. His head was bent over her, his eyes closed. She reached down to stroke him lightly.</p> <p>"You are the most beautiful thing I've ever imagined," she said softly, running her fingers over his hair and running her fingernails over his chest. He groaned.</p> <p>"Now, we better get back to what we planned," she cooed, moving over to the bathroom to fix her hair and brush herself.</p> <p>When they got back to bed, they had the most exquisite romantic dinner. He held her close, trying to hold off his own desire, his need for her.</p> <p>"I can't wait to feel you naked next to me," he whispered, hoping her would say yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
