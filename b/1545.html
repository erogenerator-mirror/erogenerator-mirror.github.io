"I'm going to come, too. And I want to make that moment last....," he could barely finish the sentence as a very deep squeal left her body. As the waves of pleasure coursed through her cunt, she lifted off Liam so that she could feel and kiss his face, neck, and chest. "Mmmm... I like you like you can't wait to come inside me." They lay side by side; still tangled together in a blanket before he rolled over and kissed her. "My god this feels incredible. Don't stop," she said as she snuggled close into him and they snuggled deeper into the darkness.</p> <p>Liam drifted off to sleep the next morning, the most peaceful and dreamless dream he'd ever experienced. When he awoke it was like waking up from a dream - a strange, surreal, and incredibly erotic one - one that he never thought he'd ever dream of doing. It took him almost as long to come back to his senses to realize he still had to use the bathroom. When he showered he wondered why he had to sit in the shower for so long until the water was running cold. He found some white briefs that he had never worn before and tried to decide if he should wear them. They were all he could find in the bathroom, but he just couldn't find one to wear - he remembered what was happening and he had to change quickly. He tried not to look at the bulge in his shorts to determine what might be going through his head. He did his best to wear panties that he hadn't worn before, but that he could just leave.</p> <p>When he returned to his apartment in the morning, Liam wasn't so sure that he had the nerve to wear panties, but even if he did he thought he still might be able to think logically about it anyway. He looked through the fridge and, as he suspected, it contained no clothes... if he wore the kind in the past and a nightgown and robe. He put on the white pair of briefs he had been wearing the night before and was surprised to see that the color turned him on even more. "Hey, I thought I looked pretty good last night," he mumbled as he pulled on the terrycloth robe and stepped back into his bathroom. The room had a light mist on it and as he started the shower he looked back at his apartment and the shower. He couldn't go to bed without panties just then as memories of their night of passion began to flood his consciousness. He couldn't wait to have his hands exploring himself and to feel the soft fabric of panties, as his cock grew and became hard. He put the panties on and then slipped them on and started to dry off as he stared into the mirror. He looked good enough to eat and he could hardly wait to see what his body looked like. He slipped his shirt on, got into the bathrobe that he brought and took some toiletries to the bathroom before going to the kitchen to have a quick breakfast. Lying on the counter by the sink was the white teddy and matching robe from the night before. He couldn't resist the temptation. He couldn't wait to get into bed with him, to touch him, to kiss his body and he couldn't wait to feel his soft lips against his own and to feel his tongue slide between his lips. He was in the mood to do just that - to be ready to enjoy things completely.</p> <p>Liam finished his breakfast and got out his shaving equipment to make his shave as he stared at himself in his full-length bathroom mirror. He hadn't really thought much about himself - what would he do if he thought he was attractive enough? What would his reaction be at seeing a man shave his body, his face? How much hair would it make his mouth feel? Would he be able to get as hard as he had the night before if he really shaved his body? He couldn't remember, but it was pretty sure in his mind that it would happen sometime in the next couple of weeks. It didn't matter.</p> <p>He shaved his body, the entire top half of it, leaving it completely bare. He started on the inside of his upper torso. The feeling was electric. Slowly he went further down each leg, enjoying the way a leg felt as he worked his way toward the knee. He moved to the thigh nearest the door, using the one where the robe had dropped to the floor to get the last bit of leg. He didn't seem to notice that he had started on the bottom half of his body. All of one leg he could see was his penis straining through the opening of the robe. He took his timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
