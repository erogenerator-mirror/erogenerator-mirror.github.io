I'm happy that you're such a nice guy. Now, can we go to the bedroom?"</p> <p>The conversation continued for another 15 minutes or so before she said, "That was the last time you were leaving the house. I need to have a talk with my husband before you go. I don't even have a dress to wear in public, and I think that's what he wants to hear."</p> <p>"If your husband would agree to that, please say yes. I am tired of being an all-around dork."</p> <p>"Heavens no, I love him with all my heart. But I will be your good boy and only his good boy."</p> <p>"That leaves the bedroom!"</p> <p>"Good heavens, what's the difference with a blowjob in the master bedroom?</p> <p>I smiled at her and said, "I'm not in too much danger of getting caught. It was a long time ago, I think."</p> <p>"It was an all-night thing that we did. I can still taste the mixture of our juices in my mouth!"</p> <p>"I've never tried a blowjob before, but I'll bet you will be very good. I bet you can come like this very often!"</p> <p>"No way we're doing this without sex! You'll just have to take me at my word!"</p> <p>They were both quiet for a while. She asked me how we were going to go about it. I told her what an awesome experience it was going to be. She smiled, "I'm sure that if we hadn't been together, I would have told you when we got home."</p> <p>"That's a good thing!"</p> <p>She was quiet for a long time. I was starting to get horny because I wasn't used to being talked to like this. Before she started talking again, she turned to face me. I could see she was as uncomfortable as I was, that she was in a sort of daze. It wasn't that she was upset, but this seemed the time spent with each sentence that she was going to get it out of her.</p> <p>"I'm not sure what's going to happen tonight."</p> <p>"Me neither. He can't keep it together with you, you're way too good looking."</p> <p>"This is all just going on in a kind of haze. I'd take that as encouragement."</p> <p>"I'd take it, and it was the right thing to do. But you've been acting funny and you're acting so strange. I don't know if we could still have sex, so we need to decide right now. So you can start by taking advantage of this opportunity."</p> <p>"I'm serious"</p> <p>"OK, let's start at the beginning. We'll start off with our kisses, and you can be my bad boy," and she pulled me down onto the floor with her, and I started licking her left nipple, and soon her right. She got an idea and started to go back to kissing while we worked each other's tongues.</p> <p>"Your tongue feels so good. Are you trying to get me to come?"</p> <p>"Only if you promise to be gentle with me next. I'm not letting you come until you let me come."</p> <p>"If I have to have you to do that, I'll do it."</p> <p>"OK. I'll keep kissing for now, and let you know when you can come." She was starting to breathe heavily and pushing her chest against my mouth. I lifted my head up in case I was going to need to use my hands to put more distance between us.</p> <p>"Marry me."</p> <p>She got a small chuckle, "It's only just starting. Besides, you know how much this means to me."</p> <p>I raised my head again, "It means I want you back in everyway. You're in my bed now."</p> <p>"I am."</p> <p>It felt fantastic to say it. She pushed her hips into me, and then lifted her arms and kissed me once more.</p> <p>"You're going to do everything that I ask you to do, when I say it. If I'm sure you'll come, I'd like to feel your cock again. If I'm sure it'll make you come, I'd like to feel you spurting into my pussy."</p> <p>"Your pussy isn't going to do anything?"</p> <p>"When you say it's not going to."</p> <p>I lifted my legs and held them apart with her arms.
