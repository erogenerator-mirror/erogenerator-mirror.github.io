"And I want to tell you that for now, you just let me take care of your business while you think about that."</p> <p>"I'm here," Bill said.</p> <p>She rolled over on her back and pulled him on top of her. As they kissed, she slid one hand into his swimsuit and squeezed his swollen member. There was no doubt that his erection was a lot bigger than what she had thought it might be. His cock was so wet that it slid easily down her slick crevice. She moaned into his mouth when he sank his fingers into her hot, wet folds. She pulled him back up so she could kiss him again.</p> <p>She broke the kiss. "Let's go down a bit," she said.</p> <p>She slid off the chaise and took off her shoes as she walked back to the pool. She grabbed her towel and stepped into the water. She sat and began drying off.</p> <p>"Would you mind coming with me?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, come on, it'll be fun."</p> <p>A few minutes later his erection returned. Their eyes locked as he approached the chaise. She stopped him, leaned on the end of the chaise, and spread her legs. He stepped up to the edge and stood between them. She held his cock with one hand as she kissed him. She slid the head between her wet lips and let him slide the rest of the way home.</p> <p>Bill closed his eyes and enjoyed the moment. As though they had been here before, this was not going to be awkward or anything. They just wanted to be together again. He put his arms behind his head and leaned back against the softness of the cushion.</p> <p>Her soft lips slid from his mouth to his, their tongues intertwined as they kissed. She pulled away and reached behind herself. He looked up at her.</p> <p>She reached behind her and unclasped her bra. As she drew it down from her shoulders, he saw she was not wearing a bra. Her lovely nipples stood out like small pebbles. She dropped the bra and let her hands fall back to her sides, her breasts thrust forward and inviting.</p> <p>She began rubbing his erection back and forth through his swimsuit material while they kissed. The feeling was both erotic and sensual. She loved what he was doing to her, and she loved to be pleasured. As he lifted himself up off her and stepped out of the water, she reached back and unclasped her thong. He stepped out of the swimsuit before taking a hold of the elastic and pulling it down to her knees.</p> <p>She lifted one of her feet to step out of the water as he stepped out of the water, leaving her legs bare.</p> <p>"Let me," he said.</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her mouth urgently. She began to grind against him as they kissed and fondled each other. He grabbed the sides of her firm breasts and pinched each nipple. She took his hand and put it between her legs. It felt so good, warm, slippery, slippery, wet, and oh so hard in his hand. She could feel the blood surging through his arm muscles making his thumb rub her clitoris.</p> <p>Bill gently pushed her down over the arm of the chaise, then began to pull her legs up and down his own while he held her around the waist with one hand. He was now lying on top of her, his lips still kissing her mouth as his erection rubbed along the bare lips of her pussy.</p> <p>She felt the heat begin to envelope her body. It was like a hot stream. It felt so good, so exciting, so erotic. He began to slide his erection back and forth along her slit, back and forth, as her hands began to fondle his bottom. She spread her legs as far apart as she could. Her body felt it as though it were on fire and wanting to cum. Bill could feel the tension rising, the tension building, the urgency of it.</p> <p>She could feel him pressing against her again and knew what was coming. She pushed against his cock and could feel the heat of her hot sex enveloping his swollen member. She slid her legs off his and threw them around his hips again, as the tension built within her. She knew what was coming but she wanted him to come inside her.</p> <p>This time when it happened, she felt his hard on press into her slit and then her hand against the base of his cock. She was still looking into his eyes when his erection began to pulse and swell. His hips began to rise and fall as he began to get ready to thrust. She could feel his erection growing and she began to feel the building urgency, felt his muscles flexing and releasingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
