It wasn't something we had done in a while; I guess she just felt it a little differently than she usually did, to move to a more comfortable position. I was pretty sore, so she quickly worked herself back up to her regular position. The big dildo was rubbing her clit with every thrust, and she was getting close to coming. I got up and sat down next to her, and started fingering her as I kept talking to her.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, Oh I'm going to cum, I'm going to come, I'm making you cum!" she moaned, and then screamed out one last time.</p> <p>The dildo was still fucking me, and my thumb kept teasing her clit, when I yelled out, "I'm going to come!"</p> <p>I didn't have to say anything; I just felt her pussy gripping me tighter, and I started moaning louder as I lost it. I was grunting with each thrust, and her hand came down more rapidly. I reached up and grabbed her breasts, pinching the nipples roughly, and she started to come again, but before I was done, she started yelling, and her whole body clamped down onto me as she let out a huge, high pitched groan that shook the whole room.</p> <p>When she finally relaxed, she looked at me, and she had a smile on her face that was unmistakably fake. That was definitely a fake.</p> <p>"Wow," I whispered to her. "This was incredible."</p> <p>"You're telling me," she said, and kissed me. "That was just too intense."</p> <p>We spent the next twenty or so minutes talking, all the while fingering each other, and I had a hard time keeping my dick in my pants. We broke at the time, and I turned to go, but she stopped me.</p> <p>"If you're going to keep this up," she said, "it better be worth every time you make me come."</p> <p>I smiled at her, and stood up, still in my pants, and started to walk towards the door. After one more dance with this naked woman while wearing a condom, and I left the room without saying another word, I walked by her and I said "Hi, um, I think you're supposed to come back to my room now, aren't you?"</p> <p>"I'm not going back there unless you have something that you want to say," she answered.</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>She pulled me closer. "You just keep your promise," she said. "I'll show you mine when I'm done."</p> <p>I opened the door for her, and she put one leg over mine, leaving her pussy directly on my hand. I looked down at it, and I could see that it had been soaking wet. She lowered herself onto my hand as she brought her lips up to mine. I could feel the warmth of her tongue on my lips as it probed my mouth. "Thank you," I whispered to her.</p> <p>She kissed me softly, and whispered something back. "You tasted good," she said, and then started to move back towards the house. I stood next to her as she led me through the back of the house to the back door. With the doors shut, I could hear the sounds of us fucking like wild animals.</p> <p>"What about him?" she whispered. "Does he have a condom on?"</p> <p>"He never does," I responded, and before I knew what had happened, I had put my dick back in my pants and started to follow her across the room.</p> <p>She stopped and sat back down onto one of the big king sized beds. She reached over and got out a strap-on and I gasped. "Masturbate for me," she said.</p> <p>I had a hard time finding another position. Finally, I couldn't stop thinking about how her pussy would fit in there. How big and wet was her pussy. And what it would look like when I finally came inside her. All of those thoughts raced through my mind as I leaned over and unzipped my pants. My dick was in plain view, and I was stroking it as I saw her reach over and grab it. She didn't hesitate as she took my dick in her mouth.</p> <p>"Do you want to try that?" she asked, as she rubbed the head of my dick against the outside of her mouth.</p> <p>"God, yeah," I said, as I watched her bobbing my dick up and down on it. If I was going to come already after all this time, I would've been able to.</p> <p>"I think he has a condom on," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
