After showering I turned on the shower and started to shave everything down to my pubic hair but found I didn't have the nerve to do so without thinking.</p> <p>I stepped into the shower and turned the water on, leaving it cold for a few seconds then quickly grabbed the razor I like my body to use for my body so that I can easily shave myself while wetting myself. I slid the sponge around my body, making sure that it got the shaving cream all along and then slowly shaved myself. When I was done I picked up the shaving foam and carefully shaved down until the skin around my pubic area was smooth, so it would not be hard for me to shave my hair off. After my first shave, I moved the razor under the water, starting at the hair near my pussy. I looked at myself in the mirror and noticed that I looked like a young girl, with what was once a very thin upper body, slightly muscular, with little fat on my small frame. When I looked at my own ass and the way it stretched around the waist, the bottom cheeks looked so small compared to the rest of my body. I reached under the water and grabbed a big towel and quickly dried off my skin as much as I could without actually pulling the towel up and wrapping it quickly with a dry towel.</p> <p>After getting dressed, I went out with a smile on my face and sat down with breakfast. I was already feeling very hungry so the food was already taken care of. I dug into my cup of coffee and finished the food in record time.</p> <p>When I was done I went into the house and looked for my car and found it on the garage, with the note from my boss that I was to pick up the car at the bank the next day. When I got home I showered and got dressed, just the way I had worn my clothes when I got into the apartment that my boss had given me. I was wearing the most revealing clothes of my day. I still had on the same outfit this morning. I decided it would be best to not wear panties today until I got home.</p> <p>It was about eight when I met Mike, my boss, for a business meeting that followed work for the rest of the afternoon. It was a pleasant distraction on my day. We finished out the meeting in order to take care of our work, and then met back up at our hotel and checked into one of our hotel rooms. After we finished off our meeting and went to eat our meals, Mike and his wife went and checked out. While they were in the room, I went and picked up a set of keys, and I took them with me to my safe deposit box to get back in time for work. By the time my boss saw me go in and change into my work clothes, Mike was already out of the room.</p> <p>"What's going on?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh nothing," I replied.</p> <p>"You're looking a little too happy to be here," Mike said.</p> <p>"I thought we could get in touch with our customers by email," I suggested.</p> <p>"We could, but there's going to be an important matter that needs to be handled first," Mike said.</p> <p>"Can we talk first?" I asked.</p> <p>"You can come in here," Mike said.</p> <p>"You mean, you want me? You want to talk?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure, but I don't see what we've got here. I'm not that interested," Mike said.</p> <p>"It was good to see you, but I do have an important problem with you," I explained.</p> <p>"I'll give you my word that I won't touch you in anyway," Mike said.</p> <p>"It's not like I have any feelings. It's just that we can't work through this. If we talk first. I guess I could just stay here and give you an answer?" I said.</p> <p>"Just let me go and go home. I don't have that meeting to deal with," Mike said.</p> <p>"Fine," I said.</p> <p>"But, if you want to...," Mike started to say, then trailed off.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," I said, trying to reassure him just as he was.</p> <p>I walked into the room, and took Mike's arm.</p> <p>"I was thinking a lot about this, and I just want to know what will happen," Mike said.</p> <p>I walked into theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
