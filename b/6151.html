Ever."</p> <p>There was a moment of silence as I looked at her eyes. I'm glad I kept my eyes on her all the time and made the effort to take them off. "The next time is going to be a slow and painful dance to say we are sorry," Rachel said.</p> <p>"I'll never forgive myself if we ever hurt each other," I replied.</p> <p>"I can't, Mike. I'm not going to do that again," she whispered in my ear.</p> <p>We kissed one last time before I got off her. "Let's do this tomorrow," I said.</p> <p>"No, I'll go out with you," she said as she kissed me again.</p> <p>"You know if I stay at home tomorrow I'll be late returning to normal," I said with a chuckle.</p> <p>She gave me a knowing smile and shook her head at me.</p> <p>I walked Rachel to her car and as she got in she said, "Don't let the ride be the only thing you'll be giving me tonight."</p> <p>She kissed me once again and drove off.</p> <p>It was dark when I saw her approaching and she stopped in the doorway of her house. "Mike, you better get the car started. I'm not going to be able to walk," she whispered through a smile and a little cry. "I'm cold."</p> <p>She got into her car and drove away, leaving me in the dark.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do for the next two weeks. I wasn't as excited about her coming back the next night as I was initially. At first she wouldn't come. After a couple of weeks things got a little stale for me.</p> <p>I was going to keep watching her even though I wasn't sure what would happen. That didn't help. I finally realized that I was getting more and more worried about her getting into that apartment when I realized that I wasn't watching her the same amount of time as her. She hadn't gone or even kissed me the same amount of time since they had moved from the old school.</p> <p>I could feel myself trying to remember what she looked like.</p> <p>At night I'd start to doze off and at night I'd get up and start walking. I'd begin to think that I'd missed her. That she never knew when I was asleep before I came to sleep. I was beginning to fear that I'd lost track of her time frame for a while and that she wouldn't be able to come back.</p> <p>I'd begin to suspect that whatever she had had with Rachel had changed to make her go away.</p> <p>One night while we were making love I suddenly felt a pang of guilt. I knew that I'd not been there when she was with Rachel. I suspected that she and Rachel had never gone back to school together.</p> <p>She had come back at the same time and we were already married. I was supposed to be at work the next day. It was only Saturday and I had a lot of time to kill in.</p> <p>What I really wanted to know about was Rachel not coming back with me. I knew in my heart that she never would.</p> <p>Even though we weren't getting a lot of sleep every night and I was probably falling into an old habit of staying up a little late, that night was the first time in many times that I truly felt she hadn't gone. I guess it wasn't that bad to be thinking of her as Rachel, a girl, even though she wasn't me.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Rachel came home for the summer two weeks before Rachel left for college. On the first anniversary date, when we broke up, we had one more date together.</p> <p>I was still a nervous mess as I stood in the door wearing nothing but a pair of boxer shorts. I stood there for an agonizing minute thinking I might have been too nervous to be able to stay away from her and not talk to her. I felt almost like I was going to be a complete ass in a few seconds.</p> <p>Suddenly she walked into the bedroom and closed the door. I had to make a quick exit before I missed her.</p> <p>"Mike," she said as she turned away again, "come with me. We can talk about it."</p> <p>"Uh, I'm sorry," I replied nervously. "I guess I'm just nervous."</p> <p>"It's okay. I've never really been around people. I think you're going to make a good friend." I quickly moved to her and wrapped my arms around her, just as I had done earlier.</p> <p>"We can talk about anything from there," I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>She smiled andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
