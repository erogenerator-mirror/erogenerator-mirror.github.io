He reached up to place her hand.</p> <p>"No, I can't," she said, "Not until it's safe."</p> <p>"Don't bother," he said, "I'll show you sometime, and you're going to have to do mine."</p> <p>"You mean if I touch another person?" she said.</p> <p>"You sure you'd want to get away with touching another woman?" he said, "It would be fun!" He stood and opened his wallet.</p> <p>Then he removed the money from his wallet and handed it to her. She picked it up and held it before dropping it in the top of a drawer to one side.</p> <p>"What kind of money does he get you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know." he said, "This is my job."</p> <p>"Yes?" she asked, "You get to do almost anything you want, but what else?"</p> <p>He sat down in the driver's seat, and took out a pen and began to write. She began to scribble on the back of her hand. He tapped her hand, and she picked up a pen. She put the pen in the top drawer and looked inside to see it. He was sitting there looking at her.</p> <p>"OK," she said, "What's your name?"</p> <p>"Robert James," he said, "My driver told me to go with him and go to the mall with him. We'll go to his apartment over there, and he's not going to stop until I'm at the mall. He told me to keep the little key in my purse, and we'll go there," he said, "We should be gone by two."</p> <p>"Well, if you say so," she said.</p> <p>They both started walking and he said "I'm going to buy a couple of presents, so we'll meet up back there in a little bit."</p> <p>"I still don't understand..."</p> <p>"This is not a game, Miss," he said. "You go with Robert, and I go with you, and keep the little key. What kind of clothes do you want to add?"</p> <p>She looked at him questioningly, wondering what kind of clothes he had in mind. "Just shorts and a button-down," she said.</p> <p>Robert was standing by the driver's side of the car now, his eyes fixed on her. "This is going to be more fun. Let me drive while you try on something." Robert then reached into a pocket in the back and pulled out the key. He pushed it into her fingers and she slowly slid it out of her palm. They approached the mall entrance together.</p> <p>"Where do we go first?" she asked.</p> <p>"Right here," he said, indicating his lap. She sat down in his laps and placed him in her lap.</p> <p>"That's where I want to put this," he said, "I'll get him in the car before we go in."</p> <p>Robert got on the highway and made it to a quiet residential area. He pulled up his door, opened the door of the car and got out.</p> <p>"Well," he said, "The mall area looks a bit like ours. It's like the one we are in today."</p> <p>She looked at his crotch with curiosity, still looking at it. She took hers and followed him and got in the seat. She had been wearing a tight, low-cut blouse, and her skirt was down around her knees. His fingers began to stroke her thighs just below her skirt.</p> <p>He looked at the parking lot again, and took her hand away from her lap.</p> <p>"Go ahead," he said, "We'll go in one at the end of the mall." He pulled off the car onto the parking lot and pulled up his pants.</p> <p>Once his pants were fully unzipped he sat in the seat with his back against the door and turned around to pull his shirt off. She watched him do this and when she tried to stand he put his arm around her waist and helped her to stand. She got the key from the top and opened the door to his car, and pulled him to the side and over to her. His lips met hers and he felt her hands moving up from his neck to cup his ass.</p> <p>She kissed him gently and then broke away and put one leg around his waist. Robert had to stop her or he would have gone crazy. Her body felt warm and smooth beneath his as she wrapped his jacket around her body and leaned into him to kiss his mouth. He felt her tongue dancing with his as their tongues dueled.</p> <p>"No," she said, "Whatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
