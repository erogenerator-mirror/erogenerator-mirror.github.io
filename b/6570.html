This time, the kiss was less hurried or passionate, but filled with urgency. When they broke, she said," I love you, too, my sweet husband."</p> <p>"Yes, you are my beautiful, beautiful wife. And, in spite of that, I love you as well."</p> <p>"My darling husband, my dearest friend. I adore you. And, of course, you love me."</p> <p>"Oh, you know that's true. I love you," and he kissed her cheek.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>He made two, then three trips over the next several days, his mind completely re-engined, his heart singing, his soul singing. All his thoughts were the same now. On the first, a woman had stolen his heart. On the second, his daughter had made sure he was never going to hurt himself, to marry, to be with her.</p> <p>The first thing he learned during his six days in Europe was how beautiful and carefree his world really was. His love had always been clear and strong. While he understood that his love for other men was an act to be done with others, so was most of it true. That he would make love with others had always seemed to remain hidden, but in his mind's eye had always been something new and strange, like an exciting thought that would be followed by a feeling of fulfillment that had just seemed like nothing at all.</p> <p>He'd never made love in the back seat of his car. He'd never kissed her hand, on her mouth, in her ear, or anywhere else, not even after they'd fucked at the airport, but it was so rare that he'd ever had a sexual thought in his mind. He hadn't even seen it.</p> <p>Yet, his heart could not be broken. For him, it had always been the same. She'd been a precious thing. She was the most beautiful, caring woman he'd ever known, and her love was enough to make him crazy, too. He'd loved her from the moment he met her. She was his world.</p> <p>When he made his two days with Virginia in Nice, he knew something he didn't expect. He'd missed a time in his whole life to meet a woman, to learn about, to find out what lovemaking with a woman was like.</p> <p>When he and Virginia had been married, he'd had a very open heart, but when Virginia had been his lover she'd looked at him like a father. He'd wondered if she'd finally felt at ease. He'd looked at her and smiled. He'd felt a lot loved. He'd also loved the way that they'd made love. But in that moment, she'd been so different. He just knew he'd never, ever find anything out of the world better. That love for other men had never stopped in his mind. He'd never realized.</p> <p>When he'd gone to the airport, he'd seen his daughter. She was there with her parents. They'd taken their honeymoon. He'd watched her face as they'd walked, when they'd flown, when they'd had breakfast. He'd watched from the window as they talked, even when the plane had landed, then they'd walked, and he'd held her, kissing her lips. Once, after an hour, he'd been so aroused he was convinced Virginia would climax before the plane even touched down, and then they'd kissed, too. He'd watched as Virginia climaxed, the first time he'd even noticed, even though she'd looked over at him.</p> <p>He had kissed her lips afterward, then, the same way she'd kissed him. She was kissing him right in front of everyone at the airport. The moment he'd wanted to do it, he'd found himself staring at her, then at her beautiful face, then at her eyes, and he had fallen, falling into her arms. As he'd been falling into her arms for the last few years, she had been looking into his eyes at the same moment. For that moment, he'd seen the love and desire there, the passion and love it had inspired.</p> <p>The love in his heart couldn't have been hotter than that moment. He kissed Virginia just as he had been planning to, feeling a surge of gratitude he didn't know he'd feel for years even before they'd done it. Virginia felt it as well, and she hadn't seemed so sad.</p> <p>There had never been a single day the way they had been together. Their love had never felt more strong or special, or as intense as it had right now. They'd shared their passion. They'd been sharing love, and it felt like they'd never been in love before. She'd never been so in love before.</p> <p>Evenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
