I really tried, but the strain was too much to endure, and I'm sure you can forgive me," she says.</p> <p>"My sweet. I was really worried about you when I needed to make sure you were okay", she says sweetly.</p> <p>"Me?" Megan whispers, "No, you don't. You didn't break anything."</p> <p>"I'm not."</p> <p>"I never thought about it like that. It was just so sudden. Everything that had just happened. I know it isn't what we wanted..." she says shyly.</p> <p>Gina can't help but chuckle at her comment. Megan is so good at her job, and is so easy to get worked up over. She's also so sweet.</p> <p>"I'm not like that anymore," she whispers.</p> <p>Gina smiles a little. It's always nice when she's concerned about someone just because they have to think she's doing something. She does this for the best, and it just makes her feel special.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The bus goes faster as it leaves. Megan sits beside Gina again; Gina's head on her shoulder with her hand lightly caressing her breast. Megan thinks she feels the warmth in her hand and knows that she is not feeling it, nor that she should be. For the time being at least, she just sits and lets her thoughts wander away.</p> <p>"I'm going to kiss you," Gina says.</p> <p>"Megan?" is her only response.</p> <p>"I know it's wrong, Gina, but it's for sure. Right?" Gina says.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah," Megan replies.</p> <p>Gina leans in and kisses Megan on her lips, her hand slowly caressing her thigh up and down. She kisses her, softly at first, not really wanting to touch her, but knowing Gina wants it. "Now kiss this," Gina says, and Megan kisses Gina's lips. Gina kisses the other lip of Megan's lips, kissing them softly as well. "Come around to the back," Gina whispers, kissing her again.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The bus picks them up; they walk together to the hotel. Gina leads Megan into the bedroom, and it's much faster, and they make love in the bed as a whole. As the bus pulls up to the hotel, she and Megan make love again in the dark, their bodies tangled in another embrace. "Wow," Megan whispers.</p> <p>"Wow," Gina whispers back. "It's amazing."</p> <p>"I want to do that again, if you want," Megan replies.</p> <p>Gina laughs a little. "Megan, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to just do that. And I know I will. And I want to make you cum again." Megan leans in again and kisses Gina. Megan leans in a little tighter and kisses Gina faster. It's a first time kiss, it's not the best, but Gina is so good at everything else. "Mmmm. Do I kiss like this?" Megan whispers into Gina's ear.</p> <p>Gina giggles. "You want to do that?" she whispers to her.</p> <p>"Yeah." Megan smiles. They kiss again, this time harder, their tongues darting in and out of each others mouths as they suck and lick at each others lips. Gina's tongue is moving fast over Megan's, and Megan bites her lip as she feels her lover's tongue inside her teeth and teeth. Megan kisses Gina's neck, moving up and down as Megan's mouth moves to the right one.</p> <p>She finally pulls back and says, "Megan, I have to stop," to Megan. She pulls back and stands up, and says, "Okay, I'll kiss you like this for a full hour, but I think you are ready now." She kisses Megan again. They kiss some more, and move to the couch, and kiss some more.</p> <p>"Hmmm, that's nice," Gina comments. "It could be interesting." She kisses her and then moves her mouth to her ear. She says, "My mouth is already aching; I'm already wishing that we could have been back here and now."</p> <p>"Megan, I think you should put your bra back on," Megan whispers.</p> <p>"I am not wearing my bra," she whispers back.</p> <p>"Okay, go get on the couch," Gina says. "And make it so that you're on top; the way I'm doing it." Megan smiles.</p> <p>"That'd be great, thank you."</p> <p>"Do you want a kiss with us as well?" Gina whispers. Megan and Gina look at each other for a few moments.
