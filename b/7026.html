What does he want?"</p> <p>"He's a little upset." She said.</p> <p>"What is he upset with?"</p> <p>"I don't know, I don't care," she told me.</p> <p>As we were leaving the restaurant, and I saw the security check, I noticed that she kept a look in her eye. When we walked out to the car, she started speaking to me.</p> <p>"I want to thank you for the evening." She said.</p> <p>"I do?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said with a smirk on her face.</p> <p>"I need to go. I'll talk to you tonight," I said leaving the restaurant and turning the corner.</p> <p>When I got home, I went straight to the shower and got off, and when I came out of the bathroom, I saw my mother looking at me with that smirk again.</p> <p>"Get into bed," she said.</p> <p>"I need some sleep," she said trying to get me into bed.</p> <p>"I can't stay up too late," I told her.</p> <p>"I can't," she said.</p> <p>"Me either, Mom, I have to get to work, and I'll see you tomorrow," I told her.</p> <p>"Ok," she said.</p> <p>I watched TV in the bedroom and then went to bed, and as I closed my eyes, I had visions of what I was thinking about in the other room with my mother. It didn't help my problem too much, because the next day when I got home, I found my mother again looking at me with that smirk of hers.</p> <p>The next evening as I was laying in bed watching a movie, I couldn't stop thinking about the day. "MOM! I can't be late for school," I said to myself. I know my face was flushed with excitement, and then I heard a loud doorbell ring.</p> <p>"Mom! I got to go! There is someone at the door," I said to myself.</p> <p>As he opened the door, I saw his face turn red, as he said, "Hello! Mom I'm sorry but I just couldn't leave you alone!"</p> <p>As he shut the bedroom door he stepped inside to say something to Mom, "I was just checking if you were home yet. My Dad said to give you a call and come back tomorrow when he's better. I'm sure Dad won't be in class for a little while."</p> <p>As he was saying he was sorry, I closed my eyes again and felt my pulse start to rise in my neck, to where the thought of my Mom and Brad was making me feel. I quickly put my robe down on the pillow under the cover of the pillows. I put one hand on my right shoulder and used the other to reach down between my legs where I found that I was wet already. As I did this, I started to stroke myself more intently, rubbing the palm of my hand up and down my length, before slipping one to the base, pushing gently, and then more firmly. I kept a steady pace as I was fantasizing about the day with my mother, and I closed my eyes, thinking of how good it would be to have her in my arms and on my lap. I started to slide two fingers inside my pussy as I stroked myself back and forth on my free hand. I couldn't resist bringing my other hand up to my breast, pinching the nipple through the white material I was wearing, imagining that it would feel as good as it did. As my thoughts trailed off, I slowly slipped my fingers inside my lips, rubbing them and feeling the wetness I was now producing.</p> <p>I brought my fingers together and brought them up to my mouth and licked them clean. "Mmmmmm," I thought.</p> <p>I then took my fingers out of my mouth and started to rub both my lips around, taking them in my mouth and sucking them as they slid across my tongue. I was starting to feel hot again, when I started to feel a drop of moisture against my thigh. It must have been her, because when I started to spread my legs wider, I could tell that she could feel it against her thigh.</p> <p>I slipped both my fingers under the waistband of my panties and slid them down. I then pulled them back up and then slid them up my body, sliding them into the crevice of my lower belly.
