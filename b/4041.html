"But we should get something to eat, before I have to go."</p> <p>"Well, don't do anything too strenuous," she smiled as she stood, and he followed her with his hungry eyes.</p> <p>It didn't take long to get the food together, and then they went into the bedroom to put on the clothes they would wear for the night. After pulling off their outer clothing and laying them out on the bed, he took his clothes off and sat naked, looking at them for a long time.</p> <p>"I'm glad that you both are as horny as you are," he said, with a grin.</p> <p>"I am," she smiled.</p> <p>"I can't wait for a good night's sleep," he said, kissing her on the lips.</p> <p>"Me too," she replied.</p> <p>They shared a laugh as he lay down beside her, feeling the warmth of her body on his.</p> <p>"Want me to sleep with you now?" he whispered.</p> <p>"I'd like that," she replied, "but only if you do."</p> <p>"I thought I'd have to wait until we got to the motel. Then I could play with you while I was still hard. I know that my cock feels good as it presses the back of your thigh as you lay there."</p> <p>They fell asleep immediately, but only dreamily, with her hand on his thigh.</p> <p>Chapter Three:</p> <p>He felt the urge, but knew that he was just beginning. The room was a mess, but the covers were pulled down. He slid off her, and she turned to face him. He was kneeling on the floor, with he cock in his hand, and moved to begin licking and sucking on it.</p> <p>When she had his erect cock deep in her mouth, she moved her face up and his head was between his legs.</p> <p>"You feel beautiful," he said. His mouth moved back and forth on her pussy, licking, nibbling her clit, then plunging his tongue into her pussy, pushing her clit deep into his mouth. She was moaning and crying, his cock deep in her throat, sucking her clit hard.</p> <p>When she came down for air, she said, "I want you here. I can see that the bed is a mess." The bed was already a mess, and he could see that some of the sheets had wetness from her juices.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter. I don't care anymore. I want you here."</p> <p>"Can we get in the shower now?" she asked.</p> <p>He lay back beside her and she climbed on top of him, rubbing her clit on his cock. "It'll keep your cum from running down your leg."</p> <p>"Good idea," he said.</p> <p>She lowered herself onto his dick, moving slowly along the shaft to feel her pussy stretched around the big cock. With each push, her lips got more slippery with her juice.</p> <p>"It's been a while," she said. "Does that feel good?"</p> <p>"Much better," he answered, as her pussy clamped down on his dick.</p> <p>"I thought, I don't care if I can use my fingers in it," she answered. "But I want to make you cum again."</p> <p>He slid one finger along her clit as she continued to ride him, using her own juices on him.</p> <p>"I love your tongue in my pussy," she moaned.</p> <p>He began to work her clit with his finger, as she began to rock herself against his hand.</p> <p>"Cum for me again," he urged. "Let me hear you cum for me. Please. Do you want me to cum for you?"</p> <p>She was close. Her cum was boiling in her pussy as she started to tremble in orgasm. He continued to rub her clit and she cried out when his cock exploded inside her.</p> <p>"Oh, God, oh, God, I'm cumming on your cock, cumming, cumming!"</p> <p>Her pussy clenched around him, as she trembled and convulsed as her orgasm hit. He moaned as he continued to stroke her clit, and she went completely still as she felt him fill her pussy with cum.</p> <p>When her tremors had subsided, she rose off his lap and he kissed her softly.</p> <p>"I can taste my cum on your lips," he whispered.</p> <p>She moved toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
