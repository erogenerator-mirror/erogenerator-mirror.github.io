She replied defensively. He wasn't sure why. He reached up and cupped her breasts in his hands, squeezing them gently before massaging them with his thumbs. His cock jumped in her hand even as the wet tip rubbed and caressed her clit.</p> <p>She groaned in pleasure as he rubbed his thumb back and forth, first in her tight slit and then pushing it further into her hole, filling her even as he stretched her beyond what she had ever imagined possible.</p> <p>"You like to have sex?" he asked. She didn't reply, keeping her eyes firmly fixed on his. His cock moved with her eyes, her hands pushing down on the bed as he moved them in a steady rhythm.</p> <p>"Do you think..." he paused, his voice smooth and calm, "That I'm just as good at sex as your mother?" he finished for her.</p> <p>She looked startled.</p> <p>"I don't think we really are at the moment," she quickly said.</p> <p>He grinned.</p> <p>"You're kidding. I know what I'd do to you if I were you," he said.</p> <p>She blushed.</p> <p>"But I might want it as well," she said.</p> <p>He didn't know if she was talking about her own sex life or if she was actually giving him details that she didn't want him to know so he decided to push it harder than she thought.</p> <p>"What do you normally want?" he asked.</p> <p>She took another swallow of wine and looked at him again, glancing at his cock and licking her lips once more.</p> <p>He wanted to tell her about sex life, but decided to ask something personal instead. "I guess I could..." He felt his voice falter. "But do I have to ask..."</p> <p>That was a small step.</p> <p>"What are you, ah, well...." She swallowed, her mouth working.</p> <p>"A sex addict," he said.</p> <p></p> <p>His mouth dropped.</p> <p>It was like a knife through his throat. It was the only thing he wanted to say.</p> <p>"You." He replied, his voice smooth and calm. "Say it... tell me you're a sex addict."</p> <p>What was she going to say? What was he going to tell her?</p> <p>She swallowed. She swallowed another swallow of wine.</p> <p>"It gets hard." she replied softly, her voice still firm. "I like it hard."</p> <p>The thought that maybe she was a sex addict just made him want to laugh. He wanted to laugh as quietly as he wanted to cry.</p> <p>"I like it hard." He repeated, taking another full swallow of his wine. "I like to fuck like any other sexual sex addict."</p> <p>She was silent, not even smiling.</p> <p>He knew it.</p> <p>He took a long drink from the glass and placed it on the end table beside the sofa. He pushed his glasses back and picked up one himself. She was clearly not pleased.</p> <p>"Do you like it hard?"</p> <p>She nodded, still staring out the window.</p> <p>"Do you like my hard cock?" he asked as he stepped over to her and placed the glass in her lap. She nodded, watching her own wine slide down to her thighs.</p> <p>"Do you like to fuck a good cock?" he repeated, placing his lips against her ear.</p> <p>She gasped and shook her head.</p> <p>"How's that for hard?" he said, his voice low and sexy.</p> <p>"Hard" she repeated with a tremble. "But... it's kind of hard not to," she looked back at him as if to demand an answer. "I like it hard", which she did. "Oh God, I don't know if I'd be able to say the truth," she said.</p> <p>He stood back with a wicked grin.</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "You have to. I like it hard - hard," he said, dropping his voice. "But hard I don't mean hard to get hard," he said, running his fingers through his hair. "It's hard to get hard," he added, sliding his hand up to her leg and lightly stroking it before moving it back to her neck.</p> <p>"But I get hard, too," she said.</p> <p>His finger felt her pulse.</p> <p>"How about if you let me take care of that," he offered.</p> <p>She looked at him, her expression still blank.</p> <p>"Yes," she finally said.</p> <p>He noddedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
