She was getting ready to say 'please.' "I don't want you to come on me. Or me," she said, "but I do want you to do it." That didn't surprise me, at all. She didn't say anything else; her tone and the directness with which she was saying and doing it made me very much aroused.</p> <p>"Let's sit up," she said, as she pulled the blindfold, and the blanket, out of my face.</p> <p>"Sit," she said. I felt a sharp tug at my chest and then felt my hands being pulled over the seat.</p> <p>"Lie on your back," she said, "and spread your legs."</p> <p>I got to my knees and lay down. I felt her standing beside me, and the light of the screen coming up through the blinds, giving me a slight sense of her in her nude glory. She knelt over my head and leaned down.</p> <p>"Take me with you," she told me. I heard the softness of her words. She reached out her hand and took my cock, which was almost fully erect. It felt hard and warm, more like an iron bar, and I felt it pressing against her thigh. She leaned down and wrapped her arms around my neck, her lips were now a millimetre from mine. My mind was in a daze.</p> <p>"I want you to come on me," she said, and I think I got it.</p> <p>She got on her knees over my face. Her pussy now inches from my eyes. I lifted my head and looked into her eyes. I could feel a warm hand on my cock, a caressing caressing and stroking it. It wasn't long before I would not last much longer. I moaned softly through the ball gag. This was too much. She felt it too; she must have sensed my pending orgasm because she let a little stream of piss splash over her face. It didn't stop though and it seemed to go on forever.</p> <p>When I lifted my head and came, it seemed like it would never end. I tried to catch my breath but she leaned against me and I could feel her nipples pushing into my back.</p> <p>After it was over, she got up and sat down alongside me.</p> <p>"Don't move," she said. "I don't want to get it dirty on you. I want to let you know why I don't trust you any more."</p> <p>"I trust you," I said. "Do you trust me?"</p> <p>"Of course I do," she said.</p> <p>"I guess you do." I did not mean to say I didn't trust her; I was still afraid of it.</p> <p>"Do you trust me to touch you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course I do," I responded.</p> <p>"Why do you think I'm so wet?" she asked.</p> <p>I hesitated. I had not really told her that I would do anything I would think of as a dare. I hadn't really told her that I wanted to suck her pussy, and that I would love to lick it. I couldn't tell her that the thought was actually repulsive. That my desire to be touched, and for her, to have sex with me, to do those things to me would be for the enjoyment of others, would be for the enjoyment of her. I was so afraid she would reject all of me. I could never expect to be able to be satisfied by anything other than myself, or for the pleasure of others. I would never experience pleasure like I did with Sam; I would never have the desire to have anyone else; I would never ever feel what I did when I was with Sam.</p> <p>"I guess I should've known," I said.</p> <p>"I trust you. That's only the start," she said, putting her hand over mine and the pad of my thumb. I felt it press a little onto her clit. She leaned very close and ran her foot up and down my leg. She looked so desirable. She looked so beautiful.</p> <p>"What else?" she said.</p> <p>"I can't do much else," I suggested.</p> <p>"I'd love to."</p> <p>"Don't."</p> <p>"What else?"</p> <p>"Having my fingers inside you, rubbing your clit."</p> <p>"Like this?" she said.</p> <p>"Yes. Like that."</p> <p>"Just imagine what it could be." Again, it wasn't what I said: in particular the question "Just imagine what it would be" I had been asking before.</p> <p>"Yes. Maybe. You'll just need to find one."</p> <p>"We'll see," she said, and she leaned forward and slipped firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
