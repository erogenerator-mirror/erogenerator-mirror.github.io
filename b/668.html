We broke and we stood there for about five minutes with our arms wrapped around each other and our legs not separated. Finally, we separated and she smiled at me and said, "I have been talking about you every day since you got here. I had a special idea last night."</p> <p>We kissed again and she gently took my face in her hands and brought her lips to mine and placed a slow peck on mine. Her hands were caressing my back again and she moved away slightly, so that she could continue to kiss me when I felt her hands slide around and then gently slid my bathing suit off of me again. I lifted my top up so that she could remove it completely and when she did, she gave me an erotic look.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful when you are totally nude, baby" she exclaimed. She then began to caress my tits again and I placed my hands on her shoulders and she took my breast in her hand and began to lick it very gently. She put her mouth around my nipple and sucked it very gently. Her hands were moving all over my body and I could feel her fingers exploring my navel and the hollow between my thighs and around my lower belly. It was extremely erotic.</p> <p>"This feels so good, baby," she whispered in my ear as she slowly pushed her hand into my body and began to caress my mound. "Oh, you are so hot for me."</p> <p>I raised my arms over my shoulders and placed my hands on her thighs for support as her hand slipped inside my bikini and began to play within my pussy. It felt wonderful and I placed my hands on her thighs, which were very warm from the sun and the fact that she had shaved her legs last week.</p> <p>"It feels wonderful, Mom. I love your touch."</p> <p>"I love kissing you," she exclaimed.</p> <p>She then removed the bathing suit completely off of me and then stood there for another half minute while she looked me up and down. When she reached my nipples again I stopped her. "I want you to let me do that for you, too, Mom."</p> <p>"Okay, baby."</p> <p>She laid me out on the lounger again, kissed her way down from my eyes, kissed my lips lightly, my neck, ears, and finally I made my way down to her breasts. When she had me naked again, she began to play with my pussy again as I spread my legs wider. I ran two of my hands along the inner thighs from her ankles to her inner thighs all the way up to her shaved pussy. I slowly pushed my fingers inside her and began to stroke her very gently. She moved closer to me.</p> <p>She asked, "Do you like my fingers inside you, Mom?"</p> <p>"Oh, baby! Yes, it feels good, but you don't tell me how it feels."</p> <p>"Don't worry, sweetie - you'll find out, soon enough."</p> <p>She got down on her knees and moved between my legs and looked at me. "I want you to look at me," she said as she lowered her face to my pussy once more. I felt as if I was in a trance and looked back at her. "You shouldn't be looking at me like that, do you remember that I told you not to be looking at me like that?"</p> <p>"No, Mom...I didn't mean to be looking at you like that..."</p> <p>"Come on, lover," she said as she leaned forward. I looked at her in her beautiful eyes. Her lips were parted just a fraction to the side and she had her long lashes drawn on and her eyes seemed to be telling me something completely new. She raised her hand to kiss it. She then looked back at me and said, "Look at me, honey."</p> <p>I looked at her with love, as if I was hypnotized by her beauty. Her full lips gently came to mine and I kissed her again as she drew her tongue across my lips. I ran my hands along her cheek and my head fell back as she opened her mouth and we kissed as my tongue pushed past the opening of her lips. Her tongue slid deep into my mouth and I put my arms around her, pulling her close to me. Our kisses continued long this long into the afternoon, as we both seemed to be aware of the other's world.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Mom...this feels so good. I haven't felt this way in ages."</p> <p>I took her hand and brought it to my breast. "Touch me, Mom. I want to feel you." She did as I had done and then I looked at her and saw the love and affection in her eyes again.</p> <p>"I want you to touch me, too," she said again.
