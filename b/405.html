She felt so hot all of a sudden, and I felt incredibly nervous. But what really got me was how excited I was for us. I've always considered myself pretty intelligent, and this was even more so. So many nights I've fantasized about being with her, and to have another woman for the first time, just was enough to make me feel completely open to her. I wanted to feel the passion of a real kiss, or the passion of any other woman. She just looked down at me with a smile, so I smiled back. It didn't take long for me to take charge and undress her as well.</p> <p>We stood back again, facing each other, and held each other for a minute, the only contact we got in between the floor and each other, our bodies pressed tightly, and exploring each other's mouths once again, tongues dancing, stroking, teasing, caressing. Then we broke apart, but not before she pulled me tightly to her again. I wrapped my arms around her back, pulling her firmly to me as her lips slid across my own. I kissed her with all of the passion I couldn't control, feeling her tongue exploring my mouth, tasting me with the tip of hers. Our pace increased again, our hands exploring together as we kissed. Our kisses were becoming more intense, and soon we were grinding our bodies together, feeling the heat between us rise.</p> <p>Her tongue flicked over mine quickly, her hand slid up to the back of my neck, gripping and pulling, pulling against me. I felt the softness of her skin, her arms around me, and I felt her tongue against the back of my throat, her breasts pressing against me.</p> <p>Suddenly, her lips separated from mine, and slowly, tenderly, she kissed me. It was incredible, and I felt like I was floating at sea as her lips caressed my lips, and then her tongue lightly brushed across my lips. She held the kiss there a little longer, before breaking it off again.</p> <p>"No," she whispered in a breathy voice, "not yet."</p> <p>I was relieved she didn't seem upset. It was all so new, being with someone who wasn't scared, and who I loved, and didn't seem like she was doing anything strange.</p> <p>"Nooo, sweetheart, it's not that way. I've always wanted you. I've always wanted you."</p> <p>"Honey, we've been together all this time. You were the one for me before my accident. Besides, I like it a lot more when you kiss me like that." Her hand moved over my stomach like a butterfly, and down, then up, and I felt her fingers trace my bellybutton a little, and she pulled me to her again, still kissing me, but letting my hand move down her back, slipping under her short skirt.</p> <p>"You won't regret it. And besides, if we do this, I've always wanted you."</p> <p>"You mean we could stop?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, yes, I mean we could stop. But you've already teased me a lot."</p> <p>"Well, I haven't teased you, have I?" my little girl toy replied, "And what if I didn't?"</p> <p>"I don't have to stop you," I said, holding her, "and you can take me at anytime you want. Right now, I'm all yours. Just let me hold you for a little bit longer. I mean it would feel so good like this."</p> <p>With a sigh, she reached her hand down to my pants, sliding her fingers lightly around the soft fabric. I felt her little hand pressing down, and then she pulled my hand up to her neck as she slipped her mouth down over my ear again, and whispered, "You'll be my little boy toy all the time, sweetheart."</p> <p>I thought I understood her, and for the first time in my entire life I felt like some kind of goddess. I kissed her ear again, then her neck, then her lips, then all around her sexy neck again, and in little circles around her body, before settling around her face and head again. She'd been a little hesitant, but now I felt that little thrill again, running into her a little deeper every time I went down there.</p> <p>Finally, I moved my lips down from her neck and to the side of her full, wonderful breasts, her hardened nipples pressing against me, rubbing themselves up and down my body just a little. I ran my nails over her chest, feeling the softness of her skin, then down further. And finally, I kissed down her belly, my kisses trailing down to her hips.
