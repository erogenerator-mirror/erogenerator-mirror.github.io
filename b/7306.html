It gets better each day, doesn’t it?" She exclaimed.</p> <p>"Yes I do! It’s wonderful!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"I have a feeling you are going to enjoy what I can do," she said.</p> <p>I was having a hard time hearing what she was saying as I had nothing to do. I didn’t even hear the door open until my cock had risen slightly above my belt. A couple of her fingers had gotten to it and were starting to stroke my shaft. She kept the movements to her hand, making sure she got a lot of good feeling as she did. I looked up briefly to see who was entering the room. It was one of the guys standing next to her.</p> <p>She was talking to him as if they were alone. Her eyes were fixed on my hard on.</p> <p>He stopped and turned to her and smiled, “Hello, my name is Jason. I was looking through here when you came over."</p> <p>She didn’t say a word about what she had been talking about. The two of them stood on either side of her and she was talking as if they had been friends for years.</p> <p>"Hi, Jason, I wanted to talk to you about our agreement. We agreed not to have sex with any of your customers, but some of mine."</p> <p>She smiled again, “Okay, how about I fix it?" She asked.</p> <p>Jason looked her over and said, "Sure if that’s what you want to do."</p> <p>Julie smiled again, “No, you’re not doing anything wrong. This is all between you and me."</p> <p>"That’s okay," said Jason, "I’ll see what I can do for you in the back room, if that’s all right with you."</p> <p>Julie got up from the desk and began to walk to the back.</p> <p>"No, please take your time," she said, "I have a few things to get straight in bed in the bedroom. I’m not going to have anything to do with sex right away."</p> <p>Jason said, "You are right. I’ll go get you what you want too."</p> <p>He began to walk toward the back door, but Julie stopped him. "Let me get you something," she said. She reached to my belt and then unbuckled my pants. She ran her hands over my hard cock and then led me toward the kitchen. We walked past the open door to the dining room and into the kitchen. She had turned a couple of tables in the dining room so she could lean over one table. She bent over slightly as Jason stood over her.</p> <p>"Just what did you have in mind, Jason? I thought I had all the time in the world." She said, as she grabbed my cock and began to stroke it.</p> <p>"I’m going to just stand over you at the end of that table in a chair," I said.</p> <p>She reached and guided me to a standing position on the chair I was in. "I need you to hold me up with your left arm and the chair," she said as she pushed her hips against mine.</p> <p>She grabbed my cock and led me to her cunt. I placed my cock at her opening and slowly slid inside. The two of them moaned as I slowly began to move into her. I leaned over to her and we kissed. She reached out and took my cock in her hand and said, "You like?"</p> <p>"It feels good," I replied.</p> <p>"I do too," she said. I began to move my hips and she started to move her hips, up and then down on my cock. She reached between them to rub her clitoris as I continued to fuck her. I reached around and found her perfect breasts as I continued to move inside her. I lowered my head and took one nipple in my mouth. It was hard and I began to suck on it while pumping my cock into her.</p> <p>When the first orgasm began to well up inside her, she began pushing her hips up against me, holding me inside of her. I could feel her muscles contracting around my cock and knew I wouldn’t be able to hold out at all. Her orgasm intensified and I felt my own. I thrust deep and began thrusting into her as deeply as possible, pressing as hard as I could against her. I came harder than I thought I could.</p> <p>We held together and continued to kiss as I slid my cock a few more inches out of her and into her.</p> <p>We were both panting as we finally relaxed as I began to slide it in and out of her. She began to moan, "Oh wow, that was good. You are a good lover."</p> <p>I began to feel a little guilty as well when all of a sudden I felt—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
