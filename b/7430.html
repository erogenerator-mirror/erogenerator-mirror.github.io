You can be proud of any girl who comes along."</p> <p>"As I'm certainly proud of you, Doctor," I replied.</p> <p>"I also appreciate your compliment, " said Dr. Jones. "I think I'll get into an exercise routine, before I leave today if that's convenient for you."</p> <p>"Oh, that would be wonderful for me," I said smiling. "I'm not sure I can go through with it."</p> <p>"Perhaps I'm not as accommodating, as you think," he said as I finished my drink. "But I can be quite honest if I do want to put that off. I'm sure that if you could do something to help, you'd be a most welcome guest."</p> <p>The rest of the day went by without a lot of discussion. The last thing I wanted to do was go through with it. It was going to be embarrassing. But my mind kept spinning back to Mr. Sanders and my new friends.</p> <p>As the week progressed, I got to know more about him and his new friend Mrs. Adams. She introduced me to her roommate who I had never met before. She was a student of psychology and one of the top graduate students in the school. She was a stunning looking woman with a very pretty face. Her clothes were simple, yet made us very aware of her femininity. She was very well attired and she stood about 5'5". She had a very slender frame that was all woman and it made my heart lurch a little as I looked at her.</p> <p>During that second week of our friendship, I met Mr. Sanders at the gym. I had told him that after our workout the night before, I was going to take the treadmill that Mrs. Adams and my friend Mrs. Adams were exercising in. He wanted to know what I was wearing. I said that I was having the treadmill to myself. He told me to just lay out in the sun and don a t-shirt. I agreed and he left for the gym.</p> <p>It was almost noon when I got back to the gym. I was sitting on the treadmill when the door opened and Mr. Sanders popped his head in. He asked how much I was paying and I told him. I was so distracted that I had left the treadmill on high. I told him I had been out exercising and was getting hot from all that exercise. This he said with a grin. He asked me where I was and I told him that I was just working out. I told him that I was going back to my room and that I was going to get in the shower after my workout. He smiled and walked right past my room to his bedroom. I was feeling very anxious as I waited for him to return and saw him just climbing the stairs. About three minutes after he had entered, I heard the shower start up and I got myself ready to walk out into the gym. After a final touch up and some exercise routines and all the usual workout stuff, I left the gym and went back to my room.</p> <p>During my time there, I got to know more about Mr. Sanders. He was tall. About six foot ten, slender and well-built with dark hair and a rugged look. He reminded me of Dr. Jones and Mrs. Adams, except a little darker. He had a firm ass and large, but not overly huge balls that were hung below. He wore gym shorts and a white t-shirt, showing off his long, muscular legs. It looked like he would fit in. I wasn't sure I could go through with the workout routine but I felt sure that we could go through with it. He was a little shorter than my 6'5" and seemed to tower over me.</p> <p>"I'm having my shower now," I blurted out.</p> <p>He looked over at the door and smiled. He motioned for me to go over to him.</p> <p>"Come on, " he said smiling broadly. "Take off your clothes and let me see you. We can do this right here."</p> <p>I started to unbutton my shirt and let him take off me button by button. He leaned back and took in my body in a close-up. He began to rub his hands up and down my legs and began to work his way up to my panties. He ran his fingers up and down the inside of my thighs and when he got to the top of my panties, he looked over at me as I was watching his fingers.</p> <p>"I want you to feel it, " he said, pointing to where his hands had been rubbing my legs. He ran his hands slowly up my sides and up again over my breasts. He seemed to enjoy my tits and his hands kept returning toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
