"You're like me, Tom. I don't care about anyone else. That's all that matters to me."</p> <p>"So when did you decide against the divorce?" I asked.</p> <p>"Tom, you're not a bad guy any more, are you?" Mary asked.</p> <p>"No, not really," I answered her. "We're just good friends. We don't have sex, do we?"</p> <p>"Of course not," Mary answered with that same smile. "I told you so... and I do mean that." Mary then gave me a quick kiss with her lips and her tongue. "And yes, it's true."</p> <p>"But I never..." I started to say. "I never wanted anyone."</p> <p>"Tom," Mary said as she put one shoe on my foot and the other one on my foot, "I'm not one to hold off from anything I want to."</p> <p>"I never..." I started again. "I don't mean what you think you want to tell me... but I never, ever... meant for anyone to have sex with anyone.... and it wasn't just with you."</p> <p>"Tom," Mary said. "We are not having sex. You're not even on the list of people I know I should be going after. You're just a man. And I know I shouldn't be doing this with you. But I guess I can't really go back and find anything I want to do with you."</p> <p>The way she said it made me feel a little better. I think you should know there is something I like about you. But the reason I couldn't say anything about it was because my mind had been in the situation for way too long. You see, I got pregnant the first time I was with Jason, the way you have done with Tommy. Your son, that's the other reason I'm saying this. But I like that it came out as well, and I like that there is something more."</p> <p>I was still feeling a little embarrassed about the whole situation and said, "But, Mary, I love you."</p> <p>"Thank you, Tom," Mary said. "I love you, too. Can't we have fun and forget these things? Can we just forget where we came from, and where we came from? Maybe, now is the best time for us to just be happy together."</p> <p>"It's a start," I said. "I'm not really happy in a committed relationship either."</p> <p>"How would you feel if I got pregnant again," Mary asked.</p> <p>"I'll be with my child," I said. "Just not in the same bed as you, and then we can just be friends again."</p> <p>"Oh, that sounds good."</p> <p>"I'll just have to work off a little guilt," Mary said. "And if I do anything stupid, then all is lost."</p> <p>Mary then looked down at her fingers crossed in front of her belly, lifted her arms up, and said, "OK, then. What happens now?"</p> <p>"I just hope someone's not going to hate me," I answered. "And if that happens, then I guess we can always forgive each other. Just let it happen."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know..."</p> <p>"Please don't ask anymore," I said. "Don't push me towards anything I might want to do with you. You know I really love you. And if that means you have to give me something that you don't have, then no argument." And I then asked, "So how are things going down there?"</p> <p>"I don't have kids," Mary said. "But you might want to make sure your husband doesn't see your belly or your breasts," she said with a laugh at the end of my statement.</p> <p>"Can't he just sit around watching TV?" I asked. "And he'd probably just get an erection just looking at me?"</p> <p>"What?" Mary replied sounding surprised. "You're not joking!"</p> <p>Mary took a sip of wine next to her plate and looked me right in the eyes, said, "Tommy and I weren't exactly in a hurry to lose our marriage. We just wanted to try and get married and maybe start some new jobs at a local job market. We have had a lot of times where we thought it would be good to start a new life again with our careers."</p> <p>"I see," I said. "Or were you looking for something else?"</p> <p>"No, no, no," Mary answeredâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
