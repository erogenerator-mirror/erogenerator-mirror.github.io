I looked her up and down and saw that she was still wearing her robe but that her hair was down and around her face and that her face was still bare. I couldn't quite believe that all of this happened and then it was over. We sat next to each other.</p> <p>"Are you really happy now that things went down? I mean I am so relieved by that."</p> <p>"No. It was never going to be the usual."</p> <p>I started to feel embarrassed at how I acted on my words but decided to do a little talking instead. "Look," I said looking at the floor and pointing directly at her, "I don't want to ruin a great thing between you two."</p> <p>She looked at me for a long while then smiled and shook her head. "That's okay. He has been so sweet to me and even helped me out with the shopping and all. He even had lunch with my mother and helped me out with my shopping."</p> <p>"Your mother is a nice woman."</p> <p>"Yea, she is and I wouldn't have it any other way."</p> <p>By that evening it felt as though my body had gone numb and I just wanted it to continue. I wanted her badly to stay with me in the same way that she did. I just wanted the whole thing to go away forever.</p> <p>"I don't want to lose my daughter in the world but it makes me feel guilty," she said as she got up to walk to the door.</p> <p>I smiled and shook my head. "No its okay. It's just something you have been doing for a while with your mom."</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>"Just a lot of it that's been going on since dad left me."</p> <p>"You mean everything went just wrong for you," she said looking as if she were about to cry. "How do you feel about it?"</p> <p>"It feels great and nothing else but good is the best feeling at the same time and as for everything that goes on right now I think it's so good that I should be happy."</p> <p>She looked at me for a long time and then smiled. "I know. I don't mean to take it to extremes but it seems like your mom is a beautiful woman and I know she loved you better last night than you did."</p> <p>"And I think you're right," I said as she left the room and closed the door.</p> <p>I tried to go on and on about what I had done but somehow it felt strange. I tried not to think about what had happened between dad and me and tried not to dwell on the things that I had said to her that she had wanted me to do since the first day at the beach and my mother having sex with her younger brother. I just felt terrible about that. Then I started to cry and cried harder. It took me a few minutes to stop and I went to our bedroom to get a big warm wet towel and a wash cloth. I thought I might throw the towel on the bed but just got wet and dried myself off. My mom came in our bedroom with me to see that I had dried myself off.</p> <p>"It's all right."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said quietly.</p> <p>"No it's okay," she said as she started to hug me. "It's no problem. It's just a different time for us and it's good to be able to be happy."</p> <p>"I'm really sorry," I said and I started to pull myself up.</p> <p>"Don't be, it's going to happen and maybe you can get over your little hangup about it."</p> <p>I thought for a minute and then looked back at her. "You didn't have a lot of choice in that. There was only one man to have the heart to break me. If you don't want him to, don't say a word so that I can forget about what you said."</p> <p>"You're right," she said, her voice full of conviction. "It is my own fault that I went into things like that."</p> <p>"I understand," I said. "Besides, I don't mind at all being alone with mom now. She has made all of the rest of us happy. You will be okay with that?"</p> <p>"You're right."</p> <p>To be continued...</p> <p>To read the second part about mom's life as she had been living it, please voteâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
