We need to talk."</p> <p>I'm confused. Should I take it to The Judge? I want to know what has made me think I can't go to The Judge, even after the way he's treated me so harshly.</p> <p>"Fine. But, I know you have to ask questions. We'll try to be good until we arrive. And if you lose it. I don't like this one little lie. Is it true? I hate those things."</p> <p>I stare into your eyes. And then back at your eyes. I start to sob and you stop me by placing a hand over my lips. "Shhhh."</p> <p>You put a finger to my lips and tell me to stay quiet. You have this effect on me. I try to calm down and take your words into account.</p> <p>'Maybe you're right. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe your little joke with me has gotten to me."</p> <p>You take my hands in your own, and start to lead me over the bed. "I know it hurts. Let's just get this over with."</p> <p>"Yes. I've got nothing to lose. We talked about a lot of it, but not a lot. How am I going to get out? I can't take your stupid ideas back. I don't care what other people think. It's a misunderstanding."</p> <p>I start to shake, and you help me down onto the foot of the bed. Just then I hear my cell phone buzzing. You pick it up.</p> <p>"Hello."</p> <p>"Mr. Tisdale, I need you to come pick me up at six on the morning. It's a date. I need to see you."</p> <p>"Please do, Sir."</p> <p>I start to talk to you and you tell me that you understand.</p> <p>"I don't understand. Please I don't give a damned if it's going to work. I don't know what to say."</p> <p>"Then say 'Oh, I'll be so happy to see you. But only 'because you're the person I need to talk to. It might be easier 'cause I'm not the one that wants to wait. I need you to give me that day.' I understand that."</p> <p>I sit on the edge of the bed and look into your eyes. I don't know what to say or do. You start to move in towards me. "I'm not going to take no for an answer. I do believe that it might be possible. So, I have to go get that cell."</p> <p>You leave the room and I start crying my eyes out again. I can't believe this. I really am in love with you and I can't believe that just a fraction over two months ago this all put together makes me so happy.</p> <p>I feel my head swim in tears. I didn't ask for this. I don't know what to say, so I just hold onto this moment.</p> <p>At six, I am in your office waiting for my car to pick me up. I pull the phone out of my pocket and look at the caller id. The name on the phone is yours and I am not going to answer it. I want to know. I know you will not be able to trust me.</p> <p>I decide to go for it. As fast as I can I get up and head to the front door. I knock the door and just in time you open the door. "Good."</p> <p>"May I come in? Can I have a hug?"</p> <p>You come in, and hold me tight against you. I start sobbing again and I feel your tears on my cheeks. I can't help but let my emotions get the better of my. You wrap my arms around me and we both collapse into each other's arms and hold each other. You take my head in your hands and kiss me tenderly. I pull away and go back to my cell phone, where I find a message from John.</p> <p>"Mr. Tisdale, I'm sorry about your misunderstanding. But I have to tell you about the other thing that has been bothering me. The guy from the bar. I know of him."</p> <p>"I know, I just have to go into town and see him. That's all I'd really want is for you to be able to talk to him for me, but I'm not going to do that. Please don't make me do this."</p> <p>"Please don't make me. Please don't do this to me. I want you to know that you truly can't take any of this. I have to tell you right now. We have to talk. Now."</p> <p>"What is he talking about, Mr. Tisdale?"</p> <p>"He's talking about the things we were talking about. And they're not just my friends.
