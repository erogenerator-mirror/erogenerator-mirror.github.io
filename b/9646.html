It's only natural. Come here, baby."</p> <p>She pulled me to her, hugging us both and as we lay back down and held each other. We kissed and we hugged for sometime, and then, finally, she pulled away. She looked back and smiled at me and said "What time is it?"</p> <p>"It's 5:30, beautiful."</p> <p>At 5:45 we got up and headed to bed. We made love again that night, but for the first time that night, she wasn't so much making love to me as she was making love to me. We didn't have the sex of many times that night because I thought that it was all the time that we had alone together, but I didn't know it was all I could manage at that moment. We kissed for several minutes and then, as goodbyes as anything could be, we started making out again.</p> <p>"You know what's going to eat me up when we get back to my place," she giggled.</p> <p>"And, if you want me, you'll get out of those clothes and make love to me, won't you?"</p> <p>She laughed and said "I'll be ready for that very thing, baby."</p> <p>We kissed again and then went into her bedroom to make love once again. This time, neither of us needed any more lubricant to make love, and when we did, we went straight to "69" again. There we both ate each other out until we both came.</p> <p>We dozed off and when we came to, both of us had a full day's sleep before heading to work. We made love that night. She didn't feel much of anything in the morning, but when I do, I can't help but wonder what was going on between us. In between work, we were both in one another's business, but there was something special that we hadn't told the other about, but it wasn't until later that we got back to our respective offices. We kept getting the same type of phone call every other day and just kept bringing each other up when we got back to each other's business and the "phone call" sessions happened again. Not that it had gone on much but it was definitely still something that we were missing out on.</p> <p>I'll never completely understand why I couldn't get used to hearing her moaning and groaning about how it felt, but then again, I don't think I really had much choice for my first weekend home, but I'm sure that I didn't, so the story may not be much different than what happened with me.</p> <p>And now! We're on our way, and I'm having a shower.</p> <p>Love,</p> <p>Lisa.</p> <p>PS Please, feel free to either read the story, but if you think this was as crazy as you think it was, don't wait too long for the sequel. I can't wait to hear what you thinkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
