He replied. "I want you to watch me cum." I didn't understand what he meant until I heard it. I gasped in pleasure and closed my eyes, taking his cock back into my wet mouth. Once I had taken him all the way in, I felt his body begin to tense. He started moving his hips slightly, and I felt his cock get even stiffer. My body had to hold onto his waist for balance. I could feel the muscles in his body start to tense and when he told me he was about to cum, I didn't mind. I started to stroke him even faster, and he groaned with anticipation as he started to cum.</p> <p>"Fuck!" He yelled and I felt him start to shoot into my throat. Instantly, I had an urge to swallow. I quickly pulled back, and looked at him. He smiled and said, "I love you" as he pulled out of my mouth. I sat up, and leaned over to kiss him. We held the kiss for a few moments before he said, "Not one more thing." I rolled off his lap, and lay beside him on the ground.</p> <p>I asked, "So...?"</p> <p>"Let's keep it between you and me," he answered. "If you ever want to go looking for more action, just ask, and I will tell you." He kissed me and said, "I'm going to go get a shower and I'll call you tomorrow." I leaned over to give him a quick peck before he walked out of the woods and out into the rain.</p> <p>I'm sure I was a bit winded when I got home. As I cleaned each and every hair out of my body, I thought about the other day and how he made me do things I had never done before.</p> <p>I came home just as the kids were starting to shower for school and walked directly up the stairs to my bedroom. I was just in time to hear the shower turn off at the bottom and I heard it turn on again. A minute or so later, I heard the door open again and the sounds of water running. I lay there wondering what to do about it. I could hear him talking with my mom so there was no reason why I wasn't at home waiting for him. I wasn't going to be so lucky when they finished their showers.</p> <p>Finally, they finished and left to go to bed. I was surprised that they didn't come to my room at all. When they walked in from school, I was sitting on my bed waiting. When I saw him, we met each other's eyes. He had dark green eyes, and a light brown hair color. I smiled at the way his eyes filled me with color. As we sat in the living room, both of us got up and headed for the kitchen. We had dinner, and he poured us each a glass of wine right before the kids started back from high school. We sat and talked about how much fun the afternoon had been and we shared some stories about the life we had been led. I also told him the reason I didn't think I could go through with it at his house was because I was scared and I didn't want to risk being seen as a slut. He tried to assure me he wasn't a slut, I knew I was, but I knew better.</p> <p>When the kids returned, they stopped in his arms, hugging him tightly. The sound of them having their hugs faded and he looked at me and asked, "So...why were you going through all that, Alex?" He sounded disappointed.</p> <p>"I just want to be sure. I don't have much to go on with." I replied.</p> <p>"Well, if you can be sure. I think you will find some things you'll like." He answered, and without a second look. He ran his hand up my leg, up my thigh, and stopped just after his hand made contact with my pussy. I was shocked and didn't hesitate to do the same for him. Then we both leaned forward, locked our lips with a hungry and passionate kiss. I could taste our first tasting of each other, and I let him have his way with me. We didn't kiss this way until we were both naked.</p> <p>After we were naked, he turned to face me and we were both surprised when he wrapped his strong fingers around my neck. He pulled me down onto the couch and laid down on me. I wrapped my arms around his neck and slowly started to kiss him until we became lost in each other. Our mouths were locked around each other. I felt a need to give myself to him, and without thinking, I reached for his beautiful face and pulled his head over mine. His lips were soft, and I could feel the stubble on his cheeks against my cheek. I could feel his desire and the way his cock pressed up against my thigh was hardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
