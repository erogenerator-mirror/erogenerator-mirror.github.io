He looked into her eyes, saw confusion in them and grinned.</p> <p>"Are you okay? I thought you were crying?"</p> <p>"No," she said softly, "I was just scared."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not. It's just that I never get scared on some people," he said, "it kind of scares you."</p> <p>She nodded to indicate she understood. She hugged him tighter, almost to her breasts, he could feel the swell of her breasts against him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he murmured.</p> <p>"It's not your fault," she said, leaning on him to feel the weight of him.</p> <p>She pushed him down and moved on top of him. Their lips met, and he felt her tongue run across his lips, then his throat, then the inside of his mouth. She pushed him down again, and he felt her breath against his skin, then her lips on his chest. His hands came back up and cupped her face. Her kiss was light, and soft, and she stroked his hair as she pulled away from him. He ran his fingers though her hair and kissed the top of her face.</p> <p>"Sorry," he said, and ran his palms over her breasts and down over her stomach. He didn't feel the skin underneath and he felt her shiver. His hands moved to her stomach, which was smooth and flat, with no sign of the bones in his fingers or muscles in her arms or legs, and her breasts. His fingers flicked past her collar bone and down her spine until he was on the soft skin of her ass, brushing the fabric as he did so.</p> <p>She felt the hard planes of muscles inside of her, he moved down a little to feel her back, and she shivered.</p> <p>"Knees."</p> <p>She did not hesitate. He reached down and pulled her up onto him and felt the tight sheath of her lips around his cock. He felt her tongue run over and around inside as he squeezed her nipple with his hand and she leaned back and began to stroke him with one hand while her lips moved down the side of his chest to the side of his shoulder. Her lips kissed her way down his neck and shoulders until his head fell back, his whole being was focused on her mouth on him. His fingers ran down her back, down to her ass, and then back up to her hips and through the hair above her pussy.</p> <p>He felt her lips and tongue on his nipples and he felt her hand slide down his waist into his ass. "Kiss me," he said, and he felt her kiss him there.</p> <p>She opened her mouth slightly, then pushed her tongue into his mouth. His arms tightened at her waist until her body could barely move. The feeling of her kissing him was wonderful, and the wetness between his teeth made his head spin. "Suck my cock!" he whispered, "I want to be a virgin if you don't stop!"</p> <p>"You're right," she said and lowered her head to kiss him again. "That would be a terrible place to be."</p> <p>He ran his lips down her neck, his fingers sliding along her nipples as he moved his hips to her. She felt the head of his cock brush her lips. "Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"It feels so big, and I'm scared it'll hurt you," she said, as he began to move and she took her breath away.</p> <p>He felt the walls of her pussy and the heat of her pussy walls tighten around him, then loosen and he saw her eyes take on a mischievous expression. "It feels good," she whispered.</p> <p>"You're so tight!" he whispered.</p> <p>She nodded, not moving. "I don't think so."</p> <p>"No, I don't think we have even gotten past the first two minutes."</p> <p>"If I don't move, it's only going to make the pain worse."</p> <p>"You're talking too much," she told him. "I think we should both roll over before we get in the wrong position."</p> <p>He felt the pillows under him as they lay on the mattress, and they began their slow and sensual lovemaking. After a long while, their kissing and fingers and hands made their body respond. The sounds of her moans and his grunts grew more intimate as their hands slid over their bodies. They were so close to the climax where they wanted it, but there was only time for one, and not the next. There would be no more lovemaking to take the edge off for either of them but at least it would come in time.</p> <p>"I'm about to cum," she whispered as she began to move with him.</p> <p>"Yes," he answered, and then he felt her legs goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
