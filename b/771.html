I said to him as he had pulled up beside the car.</p> <p>"No but I was just glad that I have saved your ass and you are welcome to come with us.</p> <p>"Well, you have to stay or your friend will come looking for you."</p> <p>"Really, we need to go." I said smiling.</p> <p>He smiled too and I watched as he went to get into the car he was sitting in the front. My stomach churned as I looked to see how long his friend would be gone. He came back to the car and opened my door for me as I climbed out.</p> <p>"If you need to go you might as well stay and watch that asshole get hurt." He said smiling.</p> <p>"I really don't mind." I said to him.</p> <p>We made it to the bar and I looked around and saw that my friend was gone. He handed over the keys and walked off with me. It was a long way to the club but we made it and entered the area that led to where my friends place was, it didn't take us long before we were out on the dance floor. Most of the people of the club knew that the club was not open to the public but our friends knew and we all talked and chatted about music, sports, and so on.</p> <p>The club was packed and we found a table near to someone's table. We ordered drinks to start with and found a nice place to sit. I was impressed with the band that was playing on the dance floor. I danced with three women that were waiting to be served but didn't pay any attention as he sat down with me. I danced with two black leather clad men and one guy at each side of me. I looked over at my friend and saw him smiling. The two men had to be about ten years younger than me. He was probably wearing a similar outfit to mine in black leathers. He pulled himself from the crowd of men that were dancing with him and pulled my arms out of his reach. I looked over at him and saw a dark handsome man who looked almost like his father. It had to be about age twenty five and had a beard that was probably black as well. He looked at me as though he knew what would happen if he touched me.</p> <p>"I am your friend. If you want to dance I would dance with you." He said to me.</p> <p>"That would be nice. Thanks!"</p> <p>"Are you ready for a drink?" He asked me.</p> <p>"For sure." I said as I sat down. They had a large patio table in front of them as he sat me down. His hands were gently rubbing my stomach and down toward my thighs and I was beginning to feel wet between my legs.</p> <p>"Your friend has to stop at the bar so he can serve you if you feel like you can't dance." I heard him say to me.</p> <p>"Why does it have to have to stop somewhere?" I whispered to him.</p> <p>"Well, I see you enjoyed the dance with him. I would really like for you to dance with me again." He said to me.</p> <p>"I would love to. I am really looking forward to having to do something with him again." I whispered to him.</p> <p>"I think he wants you to." He said to me.</p> <p>"Let me know when you are ready and I will let you know."</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed me deeply as his hands slid under my skirt to my pussy and he gave me a good shimper by his touch.</p> <p>"Let's go." He said as he gave me the key as he stood up. He turned and we smiled at each other. I was pleased that my friend was enjoying what we were doing. He leaned back against the bar with his arms still hooked in my panties so he didn't lose my balance. He leaned forward and kissed me deeply and deeply as I watched his cock growing between his legs. It was standing tall and erect and I could tell that it was going to fuck me very soon. The look on his face would have pleased my ex so much that she wouldn't be able to keep herself from touching it.</p> <p>"I think he will definitely please you."</p> <p>"I think he would do that very well." He said as he took my hand and led me out to the dance floor.</p> <p>"I'm sure he would." I whispered to him as we made our way over to the table. They were the last to arrive so we sat down and the music changed to a much faster tune. I felt very comfortable having him dance with me again.</p> <p>"Please don't be afraid." He whispered to me as he began toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
