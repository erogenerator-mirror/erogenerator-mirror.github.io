It would be nice if I could be there to share the news with you."</p> <p>"Sure, I can do that. I'll make myself at home." She said.</p> <p>I hung up and went ahead to do what I thought would be the "old-fashioned" thing.</p> <p>About 3 minutes and three calls later I heard a quiet noise coming from the front gate.</p> <p>I went to the door and peeked through the small opening to see what it was. It was Lisa with a very large breakfast tray under her arm. She had a nervous look as the man outside the gate looked over her shoulder at me. Before I could say anything, he walked over to her and said, "So, how does things going down at home?" He continued to look at me. I think he just wanted to get a look at my breasts.</p> <p>I finally got a hold of him and said, "I am sorry it took so long. You had time to tell us you're going away, and I was surprised. And, I'm sorry I couldn't tell." I really wasn't feeling like I was doing a very poor job of helping his case.</p> <p>He said he was going to tell his wife in his next case. It was really nice to be with his wife at home, I would have been even happier to see him again. But, he didn't have time. He needed two days to pack up and go home. He had two more months to finish this case and he didn't have time to do it in my office.</p> <p>"I need to meet with my accountant." He said.</p> <p>I turned to look at him as he walked back towards the gate. And you could have heard a pin drop.</p> <p>"Why didn't you call me?" He asked.</p> <p>"I didn't know you were home." That was it. But, the way that he said it made me even more curious.</p> <p>He came back to me and put his arm around my waist. He said, "I'd like to see this case by myself." We laughed.</p> <p>My heart had been racing. Here was his personal assistant with the top brass. I should have guessed that his wife and I had a history. Why did he have trouble coming down, even at the time of our discussions? When we walked up the stairs to his office he put his arm around my waist again. I had no idea what was wrong with this man, but, if this was what it took to get my marriage back to my original ways.</p> <p>When I got to my desk he said, "I need to sign on here." He sat down for a minute, just talking to me. I felt the pressure of his body against mine.</p> <p>I signed the paper. "Your wife wants to see you." I said.</p> <p>"I was just going to tell her I'll be in town for a few days. In this case. Well, I guess she wants her two old friends." He said. "Besides, I needed to tell you that the new case I've been working on is about to be up and running. The guy's wife asked me to get down on one knee here. I'm happy to give her the chance to see the case as well. It's been the most important thing that I did since I got there.</p> <p>"But, she's still a woman." He said. "That's why this one might be different. She asked me to get down on one of the knees here."</p> <p>He stood up and came around my desk to stand again. I felt his arms encircle me. He was holding me against a wall. We were leaning back against one another looking at each other's faces.</p> <p>He said, "Lisa is going to see you today. She's going to bring up some of these cases that the staff has been trying to find out. She will be right with you." He was standing on one knee with his hand on my waist.</p> <p>I looked over at him through my glasses and smiled at him. "I had no idea that she was going to give me the chance to tell my wife."</p> <p>The feeling of his strong arms holding me was making me nervous. He pulled me against him. His hands found my breasts. "Lisa, don't worry. I promise I won't hurt your wife. I've already got her off the case. I've got nothing more to worry about."</p> <p>I didn't know what the feeling of his fingers touching my breasts meant for me. It didn't last long and I soon felt his hand caressing my breasts from behind. God it felt so good! His fingers moved down my stomach, under my skirt. And I felt the touch of his hand on my pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
