Her body shook as she came and he watched her. He could tell she felt his penis move in and she moaned in his arms, her eyes closed as they both rode wave after wave of pleasure. He kept fucking her as her hands played with her breasts and her back arched as she came. He felt himself growing harder again after cumming inside of her and he fucked her as long as he wanted.</p> <p>Dani felt him harden inside, still inside the softness of her. She felt him getting softer, not hard as before but still larger, bigger and more rigid than before. Determined to make sure he stayed that way, she pushed him down on his back and her head moved down his stomach as she pulled his boxers and gown down. Her mouth sucked at his groin, his hardness, his soft skin, her tongue licking and sliding against him as she kissed, licked, and sucked her way down. He moved his legs back more, her head lower, her eyes looking up at him as she took him into her mouth. Her tongue licking and touching him, his muscles tensing and releasing with each thrust against her and he knew he would be cumming soon.</p> <p>She stopped and kissed him gently. She kissed him all over, kissed and licked his face, kissed his mouth, sucked his lips, his chin, her tongue running over them, feeling the soft stubble on his cheek, his lips. She kissed his neck and his chest, his stomach and finally his cock. She kissed him, kissed him and licked, her hot breath across his body as she sucked at him again. His cock throbbed, stiffened and then erupted, shooting his warm sticky semen into her mouth, over her tongue, down her throat and the down her chin. He felt hot and sizzled as it hit her throat. Her face moved up against his stomach as he lay there panting, feeling spent. He kissed her cheek as his penis flinched and hardened in her mouth.</p> <p>Dani reached up from his stomach and her tongue licked up the wet underside of his penis. She pushed his legs back so her face was on his stomach as her hand wrapped around his shaft. Her fingers stroked while she used the wetness to clean her hand and his cock. She looked up at him as his cock went limp. He looked so vulnerable like that, laying there so exposed that she wanted to do it again and again. Her hand made circles over his soft skin as her tongue traced the soft, flat plane and took him into her mouth. He tasted salty, her flavor salty from their bodies and her sex and she took him into her mouth. She worked up and down his length, her lips pulling back as she moved her head from side to side and sucking a little as her fingers worked their magic on him. His body lifted off the bed as his legs parted and hers pushed back at him, his cock standing up out of her mouth with each long stroke. His hands moved to her head as his body went ridged, his cock going up and inside, his head going up as he came down into her as deep as his could go. Her mouth opened and her breath as it came out was warm, thick and heavy on him as she moaned with satisfaction and she continued to lick and suck his cock as he lay there. She was still looking up at him, eyes closed as he lay there on their bed in this hot, erotic position, her mouth sucking at the head of his cock and as her wet tongue glided over him as it moved under the ridge of his skin. It felt to her as though she wanted to do it again, to taste what they had, to have his cum inside her mouth again and again, as his semen filled her up, as her hand moved lightly over and she cleaned her hand as his shaft and his head remained hard. His cock was still hard but it was less and less as his passion built, as those sensations intensified as her mouth worked up and down him.</p> <p>Her body began to tighten, tensing and moving in rhythm with his as her mouth moved up and down him and she pressed against him and slid her hips up at his body again. Her breasts touched his chest as she sucked up and down his shaft. He felt his head, his cock, a little bigger than before, coming to rest in her throat as she pumped up and down. His body shook and his fists held at her sides as she continued to pump her mouth up and down, up and down, as she stroked his face and held his eye gaze as her hand stroked herself into his hand, as her breasts moved and rose and fell as her body trembled and jerked from orgasm, as her vagina squeezed as she came down onto his stomach and chest his softening penis.</p> <p>Their lips were—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
