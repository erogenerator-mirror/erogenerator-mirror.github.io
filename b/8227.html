Rachel was sitting up with her dress hiked up in the front but still half off.</p> <p>"It's the worst kind of bad." She couldn't stop giggling as she sat, her top still hanging on the tip of her nose and her pussy on the edge of her panties which she had left off.</p> <p>"How long is he gone?"</p> <p>"I don't know. Just a couple of nights." She tried to keep her eyes on her husband who was already moving behind her. He bent down and rubbed her ass.</p> <p>He did, and she could feel it. It took her by surprise, but he went a little too far. It was like he was trying to get to know her. She was so far down in the bed that while he was kissing her neck and running his hands along her ass, she could feel her own skin. It felt like it was alive.</p> <p>It got a little bit worse when he ran his fingers down into her crack. It got an idea of something.</p> <p>"Is it nice and smooth?"</p> <p>"Yes. Very smooth?"</p> <p>"Let's test that," he replied.</p> <p>Rachel had to admit it felt nice after just a little touch. His fingers trailed up the cleft of her ass. They got there and explored her crack as he slid one finger up her crack.</p> <p>She thought she knew what he had in mind, but when he pushed up the first time and he slid it around the back of her hole, she felt an intense shock, and she wasn't sure it was from him. His finger slipped in easily, and she felt a weird mix of pleasure and trepidation and embarrassment.</p> <p>Her body betrayed her as it reacted to what was happening and she felt her nipples come into prominence.</p> <p>"It's just a little thing."</p> <p>"Well, there's more, it might help you remember it."</p> <p>Rachel couldn't help herself. She liked what happened. Her husband still hadn't made her come and she really didn't care anymore. She didn't care if he wanted to do it again, she just wanted to have him. He seemed to want it, too.</p> <p>She had to admit that it was good and it felt good. Her husband had a tongue inside her. And that was more exciting than she had expected. Her body had come in contact with his hand. The thrill of it all.</p> <p>As soon as her body settled down, it felt even better, but her mind was again back to sex.</p> <p>"Where do we go from here?" She thought as she slid her bottom up a bit.</p> <p>"We go to the couch," she mumbled, "I'll take the lead."</p> <p>Rachel felt something brush her bare leg as she walked to the couch. She looked down and saw it was a finger, a finger in her ass, probing out toward her pussy. The fingers were like little fingers inside her, just not quite what she was sure they should be. The hand wasn't just fingers, it was something much bigger. And her pussy lips were still open.</p> <p>"I'm still not sure why you did that, but it felt nice," she said after his fingers had pulled out.</p> <p>His hand was back at her crack again as she turned to him, "Are you going to finger me there, too?"</p> <p>He reached around from behind her and rubbed his hand over her clit, "Sure, that's just why you are sitting up." He did. "You are turning me on," He pushed his hand in between her legs and felt around for her little bud. "I think that's what happened last time."</p> <p>"Yes." Rachel sat in the seat with her legs wide apart and her head turned back. There was barely enough room to lay, but she could imagine what could happen and how it could change her mind if she tried. Her husband wanted it even though he was just a little bit surprised that she wanted him that much, but he also wanted her to have her own orgasm. Rachel could feel her own self-exploding. Her husband was pushing his fingertip deeper and deeper until he had to stop.</p> <p>"Oh gawd. Yes please, more," she managed to say as her hand reached down for his erection and wrapped around it. She didn't realize she was doing it, and her body was reacting to what was happening.</p> <p>His free hand reached up to her stomach and cupped hers in reassurance. Her body was responding to what was happening. Her hand worked his as well. His hand moved up and over her breast. If she could lift her body back from him, then his free hand was where she was.</p> <p>"Are you going to finger me thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
