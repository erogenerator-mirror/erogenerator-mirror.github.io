I said to his smiling face.</p> <p>"Around 5," he said walking toward the bathroom.</p> <p>"OK then, I'll be back soon," I said.</p> <p>By the time I walked out of the locker room my cock had hardened more than I could ever remember.</p> <p>"Come to my room for dinner tonight," Tom said.</p> <p>I walked up the steps to the door and found Tom already inside the door.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you Tom... it'd be my pleasure!" I said to him.</p> <p>"Don't say it like that," he said with a sly smile.</p> <p>"OK," I replied.</p> <p>"See you," he said and closed the door.</p> <p>I just stood there in the hallway.</p> <p>"Well, I hope it's better now that I'm single," I said to myself.</p> <p>But just then something else happened inside of me. It was something like the day before when Tom and I shared a shower, and I've never been able to forget it.</p> <p>Then again, in the shower, I was totally unprepared for it. I've never touched myself before, but I think there was an unexpected feeling when I did. It was like nothing that we've ever shared before. I think as I stood under the stream of water the feeling got stronger and stronger.</p> <p>I know now that the feeling was only in the moments since when I had sex with Tom; just like now with him. Just thinking about it made me hard, and it wasn't just because of the feel of soap against my ass. It was because I thought about watching myself, watching as Tom's hard cock was entering me from behind.</p> <p>I was lost in the thought when I heard his bathroom door lock. I couldn't get up quickly enough just to slip out into the hallway, and then I heard him coming through the door. I almost panicked a little as I jumped back to my room. Had I made a mistake of picking up the phone or forgetting something? Or maybe I'd even failed to find the right key, and I probably would have done the same thing had not the key turned up.</p> <p>"Uh... Tom? Are you there?" I called him out in the darkness. I wanted to make sure he was okay; my pussy was soaked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm here. Are you okay?" Tom said.</p> <p>"Yeah... yeah... I'm fine," I answered him. But I didn't feel anything or anything; I tried not to be.</p> <p>"I'll be in the bathroom waiting for you," he said opening the door and returning to the bathroom.</p> <p>I was trying to stay in a trance, and I wanted to turn back and see what was happening inside. I wanted to get up, and I wanted to run and hide.</p> <p>"Where are you?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm in my room. What did you do?" I asked.</p> <p>"I just caught the shower, and I just heard a strange sound... and I think something happened to the shower."</p> <p>He didn't say anything, so I knew it wasn't anything from the shower. In fact, it seemed like both. I was lost in thought again and suddenly the world spun out of control.</p> <p>"Tom... Tom. Are you there?" I answered him in my sweetest voice.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm in the bathroom waiting for you." Tom said with a smile. "I thought you might want to come home," he said.</p> <p>"Why would you think I needed to come home?" I asked him. I could almost hear him thinking about what to say.</p> <p>"I came home to make sure that you were alright," he said again.</p> <p>I wanted to argue with him, to say something and say it again to get into his head. But I could feel the emotions boiling inside of me and I couldn't bring myself to do that.</p> <p>"Tom, I don't want to do this," I said in a soft voice.</p> <p>"Well, I know this looks terrible, but I want you to come with me. It's late and the weather's pretty bad, but I'd really like to go out tonight."</p> <p>"What's the weather like?" I asked him.</p> <p>"It's very pleasant," he said. "There's a tree right up by the gate that looks nice, and the weather isn't badâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
