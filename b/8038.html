They left school at around 8:30, which would put them at nearly 9:00 and they'd still be there around 12:30. The drive would take about an hour or so and then they would head home and fuck. As she sat in her car in the city, Nicole got out of her car and headed to the front door of her parents' home.</p> <p>When Nicole opened the door, she was disappointed to see a note underneath the door.</p> <p>"Hi Mom. I saw what you and Dad were doing earlier. My brother called me."</p> <p>Nicole opened the door looking disappointed as she greeted her mother. Then she looked up at her Dad's smiling face and sighed.</p> <p>"Hi Mom. I had no idea you were going to meet my brother."</p> <p>Nicole just raised her hand then and smiled. She felt happy and in love. She then looked over and saw that Dad had changed and was in front of her father, looking slightly tired. His hair was disheveled, but now it was mussed from the day's activities, and he was also looking at her. They kissed.</p> <p>"Hi Nicole," She saw her father still grinning and looked over at her brother. "Hi Dad."</p> <p>Nicole started to ask what they were going to have for dinner, but Dad stopped her.</p> <p>"I'm not hungry."</p> <p>"Dad. You know your mom wants to come to the party tonight. Do you want to come on Friday?"</p> <p>"I can't go on Friday, Dad. I'm leaving in late."</p> <p>He nodded and watched as Nicole nodded, a bit surprised. He saw how tired her mother looked, too, but did not say it as he had done, or didn't, in the past. She had been much better this year and it was going to be really good for him, or maybe that was because of her and Jason, or maybe all of them. He could live with that.</p> <p></p> <p>Jason had been gone a long time coming home from college. He hadn't been much of a homebody, since he'd turned 18. It was a little tough with everyone having graduated, most of the girls having been in high school, so he had always wanted to stay home. When he got some of his old friends to come spend that weekend, he had to admit he liked being around them. It was nice to know Jason and now they had friends, not that he minded. But his parents wouldn't approve. It was more like he would be living here, doing the housework, but Jason's parents approved, too.</p> <p>Not everyone was going to be able to stay at a house with him, but most were, and there was no way anyone could stay. So he'd have to stay home alone all of the time. He hoped that would change.</p> <p>"No problem, Dad." He was about to say something, when he saw the look in his eyes. Something made him look away from him.</p> <p>"You're scaring me, Nicole."</p> <p>"I'm just giving you a break. I'm not the one who went out with your brother tonight. He's not supposed to be gone when Jason gets home from college."</p> <p>His father's mouth fell open. "You two look at each other all night. What the hell has gotten into you?"</p> <p>"I dunno. We're just trying to get into each other's pants."</p> <p>"But you're dating Jason and you might get into bed with him."</p> <p>"Well I don't know, Dad. I mean, we're friends. But I guess we'd be crazy not to."</p> <p>His father grinned a little and he thought he knew a story. But now he was ready to take it.</p> <p>"Yeah, well if you guys are going to be going out, Jason and I are going too. So I'm just going to go to the movies, and I'll catch up with you when I get home from school. OK?"</p> <p>Nicole nodded her head and stood up as her father's eyes were riveted on her crotch. It was a short distance up the street from where he walked, so if he saw her panties and anything at the same time, he wouldn't miss it.</p> <p>"Thanks Dad. I'm not so bad after all."</p> <p></p> <p>"We'll see what we can do tonight if you'll excuse us."</p> <p>"I gotta go see Jason. I'm going to be really busy until Friday."</p> <p>Once more his father grinned, "I guess there's no reason not to."</p> <p>Nicole looked confused.</p> <p>"That's why I brought Jason with me.
