She blushed slightly and looked away before he could make sense of it all. The tall man's gaze travelled back down to her cleavage; he could not help noticing that she was now wearing a very soft, see-through, see-through nightie. A white lace nightie that was not just sheer, but showed a fair amount of bare white stocking and the garter straps across her thighs. The nightie clung to the curves of her body as though painted to make every inch the perfect shape and form of flesh. Her breasts rested heavily on her chest, pushing against the fabric. He watched her face become more and more aroused as he noticed. Her breasts seemed to strain against the fabric against her nipples, forming twin, perfectly formed mounds in her nightie. Her body glowed under the light, her face flushed, she trembled as the man took in her beauty. Her arousal was evident, and she knew that she had to be more blatant or it might show on her face. A small hand reached between her legs; her fingers immediately found a hard penis protruding from her boxers. She could not help it, and her hand flew to cover her genitals. She quickly closed her hands over her groin, knowing that there would probably be blood there on the silk and her face flushed with embarrassment. The man's gaze was drawn back to her, and he couldn't help but notice her breasts sway in her nightie and the hardness beneath it. He imagined himself looking into those eyes while she played with herself, moaning as he stared at her.</p> <p>"What now?" He asked the man, his thoughts racing at this point.</p> <p>"Come over and kiss us both!" He pointed towards a dark corner of the room, the corner that stood as the centre of attention for the couple.</p> <p>"No!" The dark man said, moving over and moving around the couple. It was not like him, he was not an expert in the art of foreplay, but he had been around all of the couples and it was easy to get a handle on these men. It surprised and scared them and he smiled to himself, knowing that he had done well.</p> <p>"Kiss me." He turned his head to her.</p> <p>"You can't do anything!" She said as she stood frozen, her hand covering her groin, her head looking straight ahead, her breasts thrusting out in front of her shirt and her legs slightly apart. She moved his hand away from her and placed it right back over her sex. A long gasp escaped her lips as she felt his finger probe and gently massage her pussy. He could see the wetness of her, her eyes closed as her hand returned to her pussy. She let out a short moan as his finger pushed into her, the movement spreading the lips of her sex wider and pushing against her clit. He saw her fingers move faster as her body began to tremble and she gasped again. He smiled, feeling slightly naughty, thinking of the woman, the one watching and that was how he came. That image alone seemed to drive him over the top and he saw the man's face grimace as he closed his eyes and began to come himself. He felt the warm waves of come splash against his hand and it felt good. The feeling and the sense of her came together, the two strangers having joined, the couple sharing her secret, bringing their love into full bloom, their passion into the open. The stranger held his hand to the woman's, gently letting go as he smiled, a huge smile on his face. His voice turned to an impassioned whisper with each word.</p> <p>"Thank you!" He said and stepped back, letting his eyes take in his partner. He could not resist the sight of her naked breasts and her legs opened to him. The stranger moved in the darkness, drawing closer to her and reaching out to stroke her chest with his hand. Her nipples were erect as his touch moved to their erect state, his fingers stroking the fullness of her breast. He felt her tremble as she held her breath, her eyes on the stranger's cock as he stroked her breast and moved to place his cock over her face, his hands pulling her close to him. Her eyes opened wide, her mouth open as she took his soft cock in her mouth, kissing it as it was exposed. He could feel her lips on the head of his prick and the soft, full lips moving on it, moving down it and kissing it as she moved him to the back of her mouth. His hands moved over her shoulders and she sighed. Her cheeks flattened into her chest as he moved his hands down to cup her mound with hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
