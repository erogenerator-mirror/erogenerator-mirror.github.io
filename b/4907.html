I asked again, 'I mean, how can you not know how to do things?"</p> <p>She opened her legs further and then slowly ran her hands over her outer labia and back.</p> <p>'How far did it go?'</p> <p>'I don't know.' She said.</p> <p>'Maybe two thirds,' I replied as she began to slowly run the fingers slowly down her pussy lips.</p> <p>The girl's eyes were wide open with anticipation.</p> <p>'Two thirds it feels like!'</p> <p>She was panting and squirming again as she felt the wet feel of a finger pushing against her wet labia.</p> <p>'Now,' she said, 'just do it right there.'</p> <p>She leaned back against the lounge chair again and let out a long sigh. The fingers slid in and out again and as they pressed against her body the girl could feel her own excitement begin to rise and she spread her legs further to allow the two fingers to get deeper. Just then her body quivered and she screamed.</p> <p>'Christ,' she groaned out loud, 'my head is spinning.'</p> <p>She pushed the fingers in as deep as they could go and held them there. Her body was shaking like a leaf and her back arching upwards towards the seat as she came.</p> <p>'Yes,' she groaned, 'yes I'm coming!'</p> <p>The fingers withdrew from her body and her legs wobbled as she came back down on the lounge chair. Her shoulders and arms came up and then back down.</p> <p>Her lips were pouting again and she smiled.</p> <p>'That's one climax for me.'</p> <p>She sat up looking at me.</p> <p>'I want you to kiss me,' she said, 'I need to feel your kiss.'</p> <p>I sat up and stood, then held out my hand.</p> <p>After a moment of silence he pulled away.</p> <p>'Let me?' she said, 'let me feel it again.'</p> <p>She reached out for my hand and I stood on the lounge chair.</p> <p>'Let me?' she said again, 'let me feel it in my mouth.'</p> <p>I held out my hand and she took it and ran her fingertips over my fingers. She seemed to enjoy this as little gasps, groans and moans could be heard from deep within me.</p> <p>I pulled her to me and we kissed deeply. She tasted good.</p> <p>I released her hand and she ran her fingers through my wet hair.</p> <p>She looked down at my face and asked, 'where do you want me to concentrate?'</p> <p>'Anywhere.' I replied, 'where I can't see anything.'</p> <p>She looked at me like a new car had just been parked.</p> <p>'What do you like?' she asked, ' what do you think?</p> <p>'Hmmm, I think I like the view - good looking women's breasts.</p> <p>She took hold of my shoulders and we kissed again. She ran her hands through my hair again and said, 'you're very good, I like it that you're still so soft.'</p> <p>I put my hands on her breasts and squeezed them as we kissed.</p> <p>I was very horny and I began to rock against her as we kissed. She kept her hands on me and squeezed and played with my nipples.</p> <p>She stopped me again and said, 'you can do that there.'</p> <p>We kissed again, and I ran my hand over the front of her thigh to her pussy.</p> <p>'No - right here.' She said.</p> <p>I moved my hands to just a hairs, then moved up to the sides and back down again.</p> <p>'Stop - here.' She said, and pulled my face towards her mouth.</p> <p>She kissed me so gently I melted and fell forwards onto my elbows. Her hands went up to my face pulling to her.</p> <p>Again we were still kissing, our lips were touching and I was in heaven, the whole world was moving so slow.</p> <p>I felt her fingers run over my nipples and she squeezed them. I arched my back and she let go and they stood proud and hard against my body.</p> <p>She held my shoulders as we kissed and slowly ran her fingers across my nipples.</p> <p>I was so aroused it didn't take long till that was happening and she said, 'are you ready, are you ready?'</p> <p>I could actually feel myself getting stiff as I nodded and we kissed some more.</p> <p>'Are you ready?' she asked again.</p> <p>'Is that you?' I whispered back, 'are you ready?'</p> <p>I felt her hand run up over my belly, her fingersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
