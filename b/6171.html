When his door opened I asked him where I would find him. He pointed to the bed and told me where he would be. For a moment everything came to an abrupt halt. I was scared and scared to say anything to him, but he reassured me in his own little corner of the world. I sat up suddenly a little surprised; I could hear the water running, and then he was back in the bed. He stood right in front of me, and asked me to get him some of that whiskey. I had a puzzled look on my face and asked him "What did you just think I was going to do? Did I not tell you the truth? What should I tell you? I just want to do everything I think is right so I can keep you safe?" I was stunned.</p> <p>I hadn't been totally truthful in my entire life. I had always been a little scared to say anything - even if I wanted to - to the cops but they never really seemed to give a shit - ever. I had told the cops I was a virgin and had gotten pregnant once. I had felt so guilty I cried. I had always been very much into making love but hadn't made any of the usual promises it used to. I had never been able to get him to go outside and do more than simply kiss a little and fuck. I wasn't sure if I could go through those same things if he asked me to. Now he was standing there looking at me all nervous with his dark eyes looking at me.</p> <p>He was wearing a dark blue silk shirt, which fit him perfectly, and it looked a little tight and slinky at the top and around the waist. The neck plunged way too low to reveal his smooth shoulders, so it was impossible. His jeans were tight and form fitting and just hung loosely, not hiding what I thought was an incredible chest.</p> <p>My head was swimming as I stood up. I wanted to run out of here right now and demand an apology - to tell him everything was just some bad dream. I turned away so as to not give him the rest of the information he wanted, but I needed something in my mind to tell him what I thought. As I spoke again I looked up at the phone in his hands, which were shaking so badly at the moment I had no time to respond. I was trying to think of what to do and what to do to him. I knew it was wrong and wrong and wrong but I couldn't help but be happy he didn't need the details of that kind of thing to keep him from falling down. I was so excited I was shaking so badly that my stomach did flip flops.</p> <p>As I spoke I was making my mind up. As a teenager I had heard of people making things up to stay in the world of the good, the people and the family would get away with all the things I thought and would never see again - but right then I was just that kind of people person. I had told myself I would tell him. Then suddenly I had to think of something else. I had always been a shy flirt, and I knew it would ruin me if I went into it again. I'd never been sure if I'd even wanted to admit it to him or not - but I would have gotten over that and be a good girl.</p> <p>I walked back over to the bed and opened the top drawer. There was a bottle of lotion and another foil wrapper - the one that I brought into the house. I turned back to him. We kissed again. I could taste the flavor of it on his lips, and the musky, salty taste told me it was not unpleasant. His hand slid down to my ass. He pulled me closer as he felt me. He slid his hand into my pants so he was running his fingers along my cheek from behind. He rubbed my ass softly while he pulled me closer to him. I pulled my eyes away from the phone to look at him. I saw that his face was glowing and his face was flushed. His eyes were closed and he was breathing hard. I leaned over and kissed him more than the night before.</p> <p>I laid him down first and slipped my tongue into his mouth until we were locked in a lip lock. He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me closer to him. His hands were on my ass, rubbing me there and stroking me like I'd done to him just a few minutes ago. And my hand was on his cock, feeling it hard for me, pushing against him, making me want it more. It took every fiber in my being to keep from throwing up and begging him on the bed and telling him to take me. "I have something for you, baby." And I got up onto the bed, and climbed in his armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
