"Let me go back to the room and then we can do one of your shots."</p> <p>I took her back out of the room. We returned to the room where our pictures were waiting for us. I showed her the pictures while she was taking a picture. She looked at them quickly. The one with the guy standing off to the side was the top. When she looked at it, she smiled and handed over the picture.</p> <p>We both got our picture and the photographer took it home with us. The guy was standing behind the camera. He held the pose of both of us holding on to the camera. It was almost like a double-dive. He showed us both the camera and the guy, then asked if we would like a picture of them. We both took the picture. We both liked the picture.</p> <p>We got to the bar and sat down to a couple of shots. At one point, I took her hand and we sat back down on the couch. Before she sat down, I felt her hand rub the bulge within my pants. I watched her face as she looked over the pictures. I wanted her to touch it. I knew that she was thinking about being touched. I wanted to take a picture and then let her. She looked over the picture, still not looking at the pictures. She looked at the bulge and then back at the picture, still not looking at the pictures.</p> <p>I leaned in and kissed her. She kissed back and our lips met. She kissed me back, our tongues exploring in each others mouth. Our hands began to stroke each others bodies. I felt her body against mine. She felt my hardness as I moved my hand under her shirt top. She lifted her shirt to allow me access to her breasts. I was rubbing the hard nipple on each side of her bra. I began to unbutton her bra. I could feel her nipple pressing against my fingers as she took the first step out. I felt the zipper on her pants pull down and my hand in her panties. She lifted his hands up to touch me. I pulled her panties down and felt her hot, wet, pussy lips and clit. I felt it throb as I rubbed her clit.</p> <p>We stood up together and began to remove our clothes. She was looking up at me with those sexy eyes and her arms at me. We got our clothes off and headed to the bed. We moved into the middle of the bed. The camera captured everything and we moved our bodies on the bed until we met in a passionate fuck. I pulled her up and kissed her again. I felt her hands explore my body once more and she pushed me onto my back. I didn't care much about being in the dark. I wanted her close to me and wanted to be with her. She felt my strength and the strength she used to fight herself. She was as beautiful as I had dreamed.</p> <p>She leaned over me and began to kiss me on the cheek. I raised my chin and raised my head towards her to kiss her on the lips. I slid a hand between her legs. After a few moments of exploring each others body, I felt her hand run down my stomach. I felt her thumb stroke the head of my dick. I let out a moan as she began to stroke me. We kissed at the same time. It was erotic. I grabbed her ass and pulled back as she continued to stroke me. I looked up as she was taking pictures of me with her thumb on my dick.</p> <p>"I want you in me," she said. "I want you in me hard and fast."</p> <p>I felt her hand slide down my stomach and she reached for my dick. She rubbed my head and began to pump it up and down a few times. I felt her hand encircle my shaft. "Let me do it," I whispered. "I want to fuck you."</p> <p>"Fuck me hard and fast," she whispered. Then, without warning, she began to stroke me. We held our kissing and kissing for several minutes. I felt herself getting hotter and hotter and I felt her hand slowly moving up and down my shaft. I could feel it grow in her hand. I was beginning to moan louder and louder and she felt my dick throb against her soft hand.</p> <p>She continued to stroke me with just the head inside her hand. I felt her fingernails run along the length of my dick. It was like nothing I had ever felt before. She continued stroking me and I could feel myself begin to move even deeper inside of her hand. She felt me begin to swell inside of her. I could feel myself beginning to swell and could feel the cum begin to rise inside of me. I let her know that her hand wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
