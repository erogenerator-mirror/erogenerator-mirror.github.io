Her voice was soft and warm. "My father died yesterday at the funeral, and my mother died today. I'm sorry, but I never wanted to go anywhere with him, it was just, well, I couldn't, it was so sudden." She was still whispering, and I realized she was not speaking English.</p> <p>The waiter continued chatting away as if nothing had been said, and then he left us alone and to our right out of the din of the restaurant, through the crowd of people.</p> <p>The hotel room was huge, and I wondered if we could make love there.</p> <p>I knew I would rather not have anything here, it was too late anyway. I opened the door and looked at the bedside switch. The light had come on, and I turned off the light, knowing she was still there. I looked at her and she looked back at me, and we smiled at each other.</p> <p>"I have wanted you, for so long, for this moment of happiness." She reached up and ran her hand down my cheek, she pulled me in for a kiss, it was just a first for us, but it started out as just a kiss, but soon felt as much passion as it did a quick hug. It was a real kiss, full on, not a quick fuck, but it was something, that she wanted to feel. I pulled her close, and she responded and we both knew it was a dream and had to end this soon.</p> <p>There was some discussion going on behind the curtain. It was my bride-in-law, my best friend and I-husband, a stranger standing in the door watching our next encounter in our hotel room. I could see we were very excited, and we both wanted this to go no further. I told her I wanted to do whatever she asked, and she agreed, and it was only a dream, but it was all I could do to keep from asking her for sex.</p> <p>"He can watch us do that, if he wants to, I think he wants us to. I'll just watch him a little while," she said to me. "I love you and want this to happen, I just want to see if I can say I'm going to do anything for you." I nodded, and we kissed again, again longer than the first. It only lasted a second or two, but it added something to our new relationship.</p> <p>The stranger looked at us for a second and nodded, then left the room.</p> <p>I closed the door and locked it, and the curtain was moving, but I wanted to see what else we would do, so I pulled her in for a kiss. It was a second or two, but it was very real to the moment. She was very quiet and I could feel her lips trembling, her tongue trying to make contact with mine. We moved toward the bed and she was already undoing my pants, when I moved her onto the bed and pulled her pants and panties off. We did that two or three more times while I held her hands and watched her face. I saw her knees go slightly apart and knew she was getting the hint. This time, I moved between her legs and started to push them apart and watch them slowly and deliberately move over her mound. It was like watching a movie, she was breathing hard and she was trembling. I slid in to her and started to move slowly back and forth. She gasped for air as I pulled out and went back in again, I wanted us to make each other come for days, but I also wanted to come just like this. She was tight and hot, and I wanted to feel all of her on me the next evening as soon as our hands touched. At the same time, I pulled up her shirt and kissed her breasts, moving up to kiss her neck. She was so hot, and she felt the same way. We kissed and I moved to the spot where she had said she would let me.</p> <p>She pulled my shirt off slowly, as if to prolong her lust. She pulled off my pants, and then I was in position for her. Her eyes were on my cock as it was in her hand. She looked up at it and touched it lovingly. I could tell she was very excited and had a little smile on her face. She pulled off her underwear, and then I realized she didn't wear her panties. It was a little hard to get undressed by her, and I reached out to feel her, to fondle her.</p> <p>I could tell she needed to be touched in a way, and she began to stroke my cock. It felt good having her hand on me, and she didn't stop until she had me completely sheathed.
