I think it's a big step for me to be this close to such women."</p> <p>As I said this he glanced down at the front of his jeans, and then back up to me with the concern he had for me.</p> <p>"You don't have to," he said reassuringly, "You could always call them if you ever get the urge."</p> <p>"Do you?" I said with a wide grin and a wink. "I'd hate to do that," I said with a wink, thinking about what he had told me before. He wasn't lying; there was a bit of a thrill once he knew I was really interested in their bodies. He would always be able to guess whether I wanted to see them. My heart raced as I realized how much I loved him. "I'm not sure I could handle just standing here looking at you wearing that sexy clothes." I said smiling to myself and trying to look him in the eye.</p> <p>He reached down and lifted up the hem of his shirt, lifting his bottom off the bed slightly. As he bent down to pick it up I could see his long, smooth, light brown hair. It hung down over his left shoulder blades down the middle of his chest, where it framed his neck.</p> <p>I reached out and ran my fingers up his arm lightly, noticing the way the goosebumps on his skin seemed to grow all the more with each caress. When our eyes were facing each other, my own gaze was drawn back to his shirt. I moved my hand towards the fabric and lightly ran my fingertips from his arm down to his upper thigh where I slowly ran them up toward his knee. "There," I said, "I thought maybe the flight could have been better when you had such sexy things on." I said with a smile.</p> <p>He slid off his glasses and shook his head. As he dropped them off the side of the bed he raised his arms and placed them at the top of the covers. I stood next to him, watching the way the muscles in his shoulders flexed with each reposition he was making. I watched his eyes as his breathing picked up and I could see he was thinking of something to say to me in case I interrupted or made a move on him.</p> <p>"What?" I asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Nothing." he replied as he dropped his arms, but left his shirt covering him.</p> <p>I stepped closer to him and sat down on the edge of the bed, looking back at his face to see the smile on his face. He leaned in toward me and brought his lips to mine for a light peck. It sent a shiver down my spine as he started to run his hand down to my leg. Slowly his hand went higher as he slid his fingers under the elastic band of my khaki shorts and slowly slid them down along my hip. I lifted myself so he could remove them entirely before pulling them slowly and throwing them into a corner of the bathroom. His hand slid quickly up my leg and over my hip. I watched his long fingers run up my thigh to the hem of my shorts where they brushed between the outer lips of my pussy. I lifted my hips as he slipped his fingertips between the soft lips of my pussy and lightly rubbed the front of my cunt with a small circle.</p> <p>As his fingers slipped lower to lightly pinch my clitoris I felt myself getting ready to orgasm. The look in his eyes told me he knew exactly what I was doing. I could feel the walls of my cunt starting to constrict around his fingers. He sensed this and increased the pressure to the first knuckle of his index finger. "Uhnnnn..." I gasped. I felt the tension building from within and started trembling uncontrollably with the feeling of my body convulsing. Then, he slipped his finger in further and started sliding it around inside me.</p> <p>"Oh god yes." I groaned, and just held my breath, trying to get control of myself.</p> <p>His finger started moving slowly in and out. The movement caused my body to react and he stopped just short of touching my g-spot. After a few seconds I felt my body shake as I let go and came explosively with a shuddering breath. It was then I felt something cold slide underneath me and realized that his fingers were covered with pussy cum. I started shaking all over as his mouth began to descend on mine. His tongue slipped between my lips and tasted the pussy cum as his fingers slide into it. I could feel the heat of excitement as it spread from his mouth to mine. It would be awhile before either one of us would be ableâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
