You smile and turn around in a half way to see me.</p> <p>"Oh my God, that was really hot," I tell you as I try to cover my breasts with a towel. You smile back and give me your full attention. "Oh, I'm sure glad you enjoyed it. I thought you liked it."</p> <p>You put on your shirt and put on some new jeans to try on.</p> <p>"I don't want to be a burden on you guys," I say to the group as I try to keep my mind on your beautiful body.</p> <p>We all head back down the path to the house. We all have towels draped over our bodies.</p> <p>"I wish we had a place for that party."</p> <p>"No, that's not what I meant. We've got something planned for our first party," I say trying to sound relaxed.</p> <p>I reach over and hold your hand. "So, you have a friend?" you say.</p> <p>"No, no. I have a boyfriend. Actually, I just wanted to give him a break."</p> <p>"Oh my. That's awesome. Any guy who can get us off?"</p> <p>"Haha, no man hasn't," you say as you give me an open palm hug.</p> <p>"Oh. Great!" I say as you smile.</p> <p>"So, should I try on something too?" you say after you take your towel off. You look at me with your hands on your eyes.</p> <p>"I think we could do that right here," you tell me in a sexy voice.</p> <p>"Oh no. No, no. I want to watch you."</p> <p>You start to walk away. I follow you to the door and you turn to me.</p> <p>"If we stay here, I'm going to go crazy," you whisper as you take off your own towel. You stop in front of me and grab my hand. You pull me into the bedroom so we're standing in the center of the room facing the bed. You drop to your knees in front of me.</p> <p>"Let's get back on the bed," you say as you put your arms around my waist.</p> <p>I put one leg on your hip. I put my foot on the bed. You lay me back. You drop your head to my neck as you kiss me. You slowly unbutton my blouse.</p> <p>"I can't believe this is happening," I say and try to stop you with one hand. But your hands stop me.</p> <p>"Please." You gently start to pull my skirt up. I reach down with my hand and stop you. I can feel the heat coming from your body. You keep kissing. Then you let my skirt fall to the floor.</p> <p>"Mmm..." I murmur as you press your body against mine. I put my hands on your chest. It's obvious that you're very excited. Your eyes are closed. I slowly move one hand to your shoulders. You close your eyes and your mouth comes off my neck. I slowly slide my hands down your arms. They quickly come to rest on your waist. I slowly slide my hands down your sides.</p> <p>"You haven't given any indication that you're interested in going further," I say as I start to gently caress your bare lower back.</p> <p>"Oh, it's just so different. It's... it's more intimate. It feels so nice." As I start to move your shirt up over your head?</p> <p>"It would feel better when I took the shirt off. I'd let you touch me if you wanted to try it."</p> <p>"No, I want you to see."</p> <p>You unzip my pants. Your hand finds my shaft and you slowly hold it. You see how thick and hard I am and you can feel me throbbing. I kiss your eyelids. You open your eyes and notice how hard I am. We look into each others eyes.</p> <p>"You aren't getting the full treatment tonight. But in this room tonight, it is what it is; right?"</p> <p>We make the decision. You slowly slide my underwear down and my cock springs free. You look at it as you stroke it just under the head and up and down. I get off the bed, naked and wet. You take it in as you stand up and sit across from me. I walk over and you lean over. I kiss your lips. You kiss my neck and down to my breasts. You kiss each breast and suckle them. You lean over and kiss and nibble on my nipples. I reach down with my hand and gently slide it under the side of your pants to cup your balls. I find you hard and wet and your cock jumps a coupleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
