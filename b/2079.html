My friend and I have been friends since the start and have been getting to know each other ever since we met. That's good fun!"</p> <p>"Do what, my friend." He said, "I can't say that I've been with anyone before and I don't understand why I am so attracted to him. He's a hot looking guy!"</p> <p>"No really, don't you think he's handsome?"</p> <p>"Maybe, it's his clothes, the way he looks in them. We were always trying to get in touch with our bodies to try to connect with the rest of his body. But never anything more than one shot or one kiss or another with him!"</p> <p>"That's so true. I have a thing for guys who are really big, just like he is, I think!"</p> <p>"You see, I was just getting to know him a little while ago and he told me that no one is more beautiful that you, or that much better. I couldn't believe it!"</p> <p>"I'm flattered!" he laughed, "I don't know if you heard what I said, but you've got to have a man on your mind about sex!"</p> <p>"What? Well, you know where I am!"</p> <p>"Well, you should come over here to meet him and I, well I guess we'll make our own little love-toy!"</p> <p>"Well, what's this about?"</p> <p>"Nothing, really, just a little thing that we could do to each other!"</p> <p>"It's ok!" he smiled, "I've thought of doing it with the two of you too, so, well I guess it's just that, well I was wondering if you would like to go to the park that's on the corner of the street and get caught by your boyfriend and your best friend?"</p> <p>"I can't, I mean, of course I'd love to, but what's going on in my pants, huh? I can't even see any of them!"</p> <p>"It's OK, I know it's not that big an issue, because I see that it really was something really, really important to you!"</p> <p>"Well ok, I get the feeling I'm going to need to take it and I promise I won't be too wild or hurt or anything."</p> <p>"I'm sure you won't hurt me. Besides, if I had your cock in me I could really go for it!"</p> <p>"Well I'm sure you could if you thought about really wanting to!" he said, smiling at her.</p> <p>"Oh thank you! It was just that I thought about your body and I really wanted to let you know what I'm thinking about! How about that, you want to go? And I'll be glad I wasn't embarrassed when I walked out the door!"</p> <p>"I was hoping to do just that. It was nice of you to say that!"</p> <p>"Oh thank you, I was hoping to do better!" she smiled, "Come on over tomorrow and we'll be ready for you!" she added.</p> <p>"Yeah, why not? It really is nice to be able to help a friend."</p> <p>They met with her next day and she was a wonderful conversationalist and he found himself very happy to be able to talk to her again after all the problems he had in college.</p> <p>When they got home, he invited her in for a cup of hot chocolate and kissed her goodnight.</p> <p>"Thank you so much for inviting me. You are really nice!" she said, smiling.</p> <p>"You're so cute when you smile!" he laughed, "I wish I had a girlfriend like you!" he grinned.</p> <p>"What's wrong with a good friend, I could get into all kinds of trouble?" she asked him.</p> <p>"No, no, none of that!" he laughed, "You're very kind to even ask me something like that! It's nice to meet you!"</p> <p>That night he asked her.</p> <p>"Well I guess you could get a boyfriend on your own?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I just met him last Wednesday."
