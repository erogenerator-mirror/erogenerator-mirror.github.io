If it was any comfort it made no difference to her.</p> <p>"Getting better," I assured her. "After a few moments of having your eyes glued to them I saw for the first time that there was a tiny difference. You had an amazing set of breasts."</p> <p>I think she noticed that my nipples were already hard and I felt a sudden wetness in my panties. I don't know why or how it was that I was turning on so much and making my panties damp.</p> <p>"I didn't say you could look," I said. "If there is anything I can do for your help, I'd be glad to come help."</p> <p>"Yes you will," she said taking my hand and leading me to her door. She put her arm around me and I felt her breasts pushing against my back. She pulled me tight against her as she kissed me, holding me tightly.</p> <p>After a while, though, she seemed to have lost all control. "Is this better?" she asked.</p> <p>"Much," was my only response.</p> <p>I took her hands and put the glass back on a small table next to the bed. "This time," I said. "You can have the vibrator."</p> <p>"You heard," she said. "You have a wonderful cock." With that she dropped to her knees. "I hope your new girlfriend doesn't mind the taste of my new pussy."</p> <p>Her hands went straight to my skirt and panties. First there was a flash of light, but now I knew from the wet spot on the right side of her mouth and her hands sliding up to feel the wet spot on the left. Next, I watched a flash of a moment later and could feel her hot breath against me as one hand pulled down my panties freeing the dildo. The other hand pulled it from me and I felt her tongue glide over my bare mound, licking the sides. I moaned again and she pressed my hand against them.</p> <p>While one of her hands stroked my clit, two of her fingers probed my cunt in a circular motion. Her thumb grazed over the lips, and then she plunged one into me. The combination of the pressure on my clit and her tongue against my clit drove me wild. I came, hard, long, and loud.</p> <p>A moment later, she slid the vibrator in and out. "What's the matter?" she said. "Are you mad at me?"</p> <p>'I'm not mad that you can't make love to me.'</p> <p>She put the vibrator down and stood back.</p> <p>Again, I couldn't keep my hand from her crotch, but it didn't last long. And I did have to let go of the dildo until she let go of me and went to the bathroom to take a shower. The water was cold, but it felt good to have hands against me. After showering, she came back naked. "Sit on the edge of the Jacuzzi," she commanded and I did. I was a little disappointed that she wouldn't take the dildo off, but she did say that I could fuck myself with it. I sat there on the edge of the Jacuzzi while she pulled me up on to her, her cunt lips rubbing my hand. She grabbed me and guided me to her opening, her hands on my breasts, fingers running through my hair.</p> <p>"You make me so wet. I have an itch like nobody else."</p> <p>"I could make it better," I whispered, my legs trembling with her hands.</p> <p>"Oh, so I'm that wet."</p> <p>As I came back down on the water and her hands, fingers pulling my skirt up, I reached back and found her asshole. It was like a butterfly's wings waiting for the arrival of fingers. The fingers explored along my crevice while the other one found my clit and my lips.</p> <p>"No, not yet! I think we need some more champagne," she said in a little boy voice. "I want to show you how much." I stood up and pulled her to the edge of the Jacuzzi so we could kiss. I didn't want to show off the dildo, but instead I wanted, no, needed me to suck it. Instead of kissing me, she turned around. I started to do the same by holding her legs. Then she turned around.</p> <p>"Don't," she said softly. "Play with my ass."</p> <p>I knelt down to lick the crack of her ass, then moved her hand away and guided my tongue into the crack. All of a sudden, it slipped into her, which made her gasp. I stopped, then slid out till I was once again in between her cheeks. I licked along the crackâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
