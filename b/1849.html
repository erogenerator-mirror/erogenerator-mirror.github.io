When they saw her, she put the plate in front of the fire, setting a plate beside it. The look on his face as he came up to her and kissed her said it all. She held his face close as he took in the scent of her hair, and saw how it shone in the moon light. He took her, holding the weight of her as they sat together at the dining room table. Finally, he looked at her, and took her hand in his.</p> <p>"Come here," he said.</p> <p>She pulled him to her and kissed him, and felt his kiss, a little softer than she had expected. He led her into the other room and watched as she came to herself before him, her eyes closing with the emotion of completion that she had never felt before. He kissed her again, and held her. He turned to her, his hands on the arms of the chair behind her, and she turned so he could face her. He pulled her to him, and she put one hand on his cheek as they came together in a tender embrace. She put her hands between his and stroked him through his clothes, feeling the hardness and warmth of his skin. She saw the fire glowing, a light on his face and in his eyes. The look of ecstasy that had flashed upon it, and the way his heart beat with it. She kissed him again, tasting the sweetness on his lips. She stepped back and pulled off her own clothes in one motion. She was wearing a black leather corset with snaps holding the garment up so that it was hard to remove. She pulled on her boots and her thigh high boots. Her hair was now down past her shoulders. When she turned back to him, he kissed her, and stepped forward to take her in his arms again. She pushed between them, opening her arms, pulling his face to hers as the kiss deepened and became more passionate. Before she could have come, his hands began caressing her, moving from her lower back to her ass and down to her thighs. She pushed against him, wanting to feel more of his firm body pressed against her skin. He ran his hand over her, feeling how the corset encased her breasts from neck to mid-thigh. He began to unfasten the strap over her shoulder that had held it.</p> <p>"Turn around, then," he said, and she bent over at the waist and pulled the corset off her body. Her breasts were not large, but well-rounded, and had the same soft pink lips that she remembered, and the same softness to their lips. He reached around her to cup her breasts, and they fit perfectly in his hands. He kneaded them with his fingers between his palms and thumbs, pinching her nipples, and she almost came there and then.</p> <p>"Come to me," he whispered, stilled her hands from her hips. She knelt down and kissed him again, then, moving aside his pants, ran her hand over his hard cock and felt the size and force against her fingers. He ran his hands over her body, and she bent over and took it in her mouth, then moved back and forth as if to move the cock to her tongue. His cock was long and hard and she could only take it deeper, and realized a moment later that he had come. She could feel it on her tongue and down her throat, on her chest and she swallowed to avoid choking herself. She moved back up and smiled at him.</p> <p>"Thank you for the gift, Jack. You have been wonderful." She kissed him, and kissed him again.</p> <p>"Please don't tell anyone about this evening, please," she said. "I hope we will never need these things."</p> <p>"Are we leaving it for another one?" he asked, as if it would help her make an offer that would work.</p> <p>"No," she said and kissed him again. "But we have to. We have a whole month. I have to take off early in the morning, and if I'm late by noon, then I have to go to St Thomas', and I have to come up from there by 3 on Wednesday."</p> <p>"Oh, I think it would take you the whole month for what would have happened if we did get together," he said. "And you have to start the day early so that we don't lose our guestsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
