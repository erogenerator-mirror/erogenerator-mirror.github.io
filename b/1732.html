Please take me, all of me, please!"</p> <p>"Well, you'll get your chance."</p> <p>I reached over to him and grabbed his penis. I stroked him off as he laid back on the bed. "Suck me. I want your mouth on me." He began to stroke his pole. In only a few minutes he came with a gusher of sperm.</p> <p>I grabbed his dick and sucked the remaining drops of sperm from the tip. As soon as he finished, I let him slip from my mouth. I laid back on the bed and spread my legs. He crawled between them and lowered his rod to its proper length. It was as long as I have ever felt. It was thicker than any cock I have ever had. He grabbed my thighs and pulled me to him, then shoved with all his strength. His cock buried itself into me and we both moaned as we connected. I reached out to his hips and pulled him deep.</p> <p>He slowly began to pump in and out. I could feel every bit of the length of his cock sliding each time he withdrew to the tip and then pushed back. He took a couple of minutes to build up again before he thrust himself back into me. The pace picked up again. It felt fantastic but I didn't want it to end. He continued to pump in and out long after I had regained my senses. At some point I rolled over, took his dick into my mouth and began to suck on it again.</p> <p>While sucking on his cock I felt him slip back into me. I felt my body come alive again. I couldn't tell which of them had made me come first - his or mine. I felt my muscles squeezing his cock as his cock moved back and forth. There was no more holding back; my inner muscles were begging for his penis to fill me again. When he pulled his cock out again I knew my body was begging him to fill me again. He thrust in again and I held myself open for him. I had to feel him fill me, as he filled me again. Just as I knew I would have another orgasm soon, he shoved himself hard into me before pulling out.</p> <p>He rolled over and I slid my legs up onto his shoulders as he lowered himself to my pussy. Even with all the pleasure he gave me, I didn't feel the need to let anything else happen. I felt him slip his tongue into my pussy and begin to lick my juices into his mouth. Again I couldn't get enough of his tongue. I was pushing my cunt up toward his tongue as he pleasured me.</p> <p>I felt him begin to piston in and out of me. I could feel his tongue sliding up and down my slit. In time with his tongue it began to stroke the inside of my pussy. I was coming again. We were both nearing the pinnacle of sexual ecstasy.</p> <p>This time, while my own passions were rising, the urge to go to my self, to be alone, to feel my body's desire, to feel my desires, continued to build. The urge to do it over and over; to make love to the only person on earth; to feel his body against my body; to take him on top of me; to show him the ecstasy I am; to feel him inside of me and I'll treasure the sight of his cock as long as I live, never again again! To feel him and to feel him and to feel him as he makes me feel! What a beautiful day this will beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
