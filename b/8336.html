He ran his left hand across his face, brushing his lips against her nipples each time. Her body was getting more and more aroused with each passing moment. She began feeling her pussy gush in anticipation.</p> <p>Suddenly she felt two fingers slide inside her pussy. He was right; this girl was tighter than she had imagined. John's fingers were in her so deep. She didn't know if he could feel her cervix and knew it was hard.</p> <p>"Do you ever masturbate", John asked.</p> <p>She was breathing hard, she couldn't answer.</p> <p>"Do you?", he said.</p> <p>"No", she responded quietly.</p> <p>But she had to. He withdrew his fingers and laid his head down, taking in a breath and then he kissed her mouth again. Again he rubbed the top of her breast, feeling her nipple harden again.</p> <p>She put just the tip of her tongue in his mouth to taste her own nectar.</p> <p>He put his head back and continued to lightly kiss her. Her left arm went around his neck and she pulled him in closer for more soft kiss. They both were feeling great, as if they had already enjoyed a few dates together, and they just wanted to make the night last.</p> <p>Finally she said, "My turn now", as if the whole world could have heard them.</p> <p>She positioned herself on the bench, turned her back and bent her legs in a straight line. John quickly went to work getting in position.</p> <p>When she felt his hands at her hips, she reached down and rubbed her feet against the sides of his legs. She placed her knees against his inner thighs and began to feel his arousal. It wasn't long before she found just the right spot on his legs. She loved playing with his big cock, especially since it was as hard as a rock already.</p> <p>He felt it, but as soon as he moved his hand his fingers started to play with her clit while he was licking her nipples. When he moved his lips down to her stomach, she knew exactly what to do.</p> <p>Once he was at the top of her thighs, she felt his hand slide from her thigh and run up and down her legs. She felt his fingers brush against her pussy and could tell he was rubbing some inner thigh.</p> <p>In his mind, her pussy was ready, she felt her body, she knew she should stop him from going in there and not continue with the plan, and even though he didn't seem interested, he was very horny.</p> <p>He slid his hand out from under her.</p> <p>"What happened there, where did it go?", he asked.</p> <p>"I don't know", she replied.</p> <p>John took her hands and placed them on the edge of the bench. He turned her so she was facing him. She put her hands on the edge of the bench and leaned back.</p> <p>"You can put your hands on the bench", he said.</p> <p>She turned away from him and moved over and put her hands on the top of the bench. He was standing there, his cock stiff and rock hard at the sight of her lying there with her eyes closed enjoying the feeling of a good massage. Once again he looked at her, she opened her eyes a bit and looked at him.</p> <p>She was so focused on the feeling of John's hands and eyes, feeling the hot, erotic feeling of his eyes on her. She felt completely and fully in control.</p> <p>"This feels nice", she said before he could say anything.</p> <p>It's been a while since her last massage, she said with a smile. She loved having her nails and especially her nails were all for him. And this time the sensations she received from it were in sync with each others. The thought of having his hands on her and his mouth near her body while he made her feel so alive sent electricity to her body. There was something about his eyes and face that drove her wild, it seemed to make her pussy even hotter.</p> <p>With the lightest touch of his fingers at the base of her right breast, she had her first orgasm. She thought it would never end.</p> <p>John leaned over and ran his lips along hers. Their lips met and his soft lips made her feel as if they had become lovers at that moment. He lifted his body and moved his lips down over her left nipple before she could feel his mouth again. As soon as she felt his warm lips on her nipple she knew she would not be able to hold much longer.</p> <p>John had his head between her spread thighs. His lips were moving in slow circles around her navel.
