My brain was fried but I kept listening to the sound of her voice in my ear. It was just as if she was telling me a secret that I shouldn't know. I was almost hypnotized. What was happening? Was it just a dream? How would she react if she found out? Did she have a wild sexual fantasy? I was so conflicted, the images were so vivid, my brain was so far away, I was so confused.</p> <p>"It's okay, Honey." She said in one of those cute voices. "I can't understand you."</p> <p>"Huh? What do you mean?" "You know, I guess I'm just so tired." she said.</p> <p>When I hung up the phone and hung up my mind was reeling. Something was really happening. She had some sort of power over me but that could be completely fake. I was going to tell her everything, but would it work? Should I be so surprised? Was she just going to make some kind of plan to seduce me? What if I didn't tell her everything and she just kept me around? What could she do about it? She couldn't possibly have a plan for me. What would she do? Should I tell her what happened last night and would she really like it? My conscience was so strong that it was almost like I was trying to shake the pain of what I had done. I wondered if she would make me come back and I could live every fucking moment of it. I felt like such a fool.</p> <p>My body was shaking. My mind was fighting back the terror. I felt like I was being hit by a dozen car horns in one of those car park lights. I heard myself telling her all of the horrible things I wanted to do to myself in her apartment while I kept picturing her beautiful body and her sexy smile with those incredible breasts and her sweet little pussy. I heard myself saying all of those dirty things in the middle of the night. How could she possibly know what had caused this? I was losing the ability to think through the consequences, but she couldn't possibly know that what I felt could be so powerful. Why on earth would she think that I had to come back to get her?</p> <p>It was getting dark now, and I couldn't see even a car. My body felt like a weight had been lifted off of me. I heard the shower stop. I felt dizzy, and my head was spinning. Was I going to have to spend the night in her bed? I was sure that I would have to do everything she wanted in order to sleep in her bed. How could she possibly want to sleep with me at night in the middle of the night? It was almost as if I would have to beg her to let me stay in her bed.</p> <p>"Well, Honey, are you still coming over again tomorrow night?" she asked.</p> <p>I felt like an idiot. I thought that I was going to explode. I thought that I was going to end up like some strange man she had picked out for me. I thought that I was going to cry. How could she do this to me? How could she possibly go through with this?</p> <p>She stood up and I could see she was really uncomfortable; her face flushed like a tomato as she looked at me for only a moment. But I tried to smile her and say something, anything, just do anything. "Honey, have you gone to sleep yet?" I heard her say. "No." I said weakly.</p> <p>I was afraid I would fall right back on my bed in front of everybody that night. So I stood up and walked over to the window. There was still light coming through the window, but the outside world seemed bright. And there were some people walking by in their cars in the neighborhood. I could feel my heart pounding against my ribs. I felt like there was an anchor in my chest with all the tension of the evening. It seemed like hours, so when I felt her arm going around my back and holding me she asked me to stay in her bed for a while.</p> <p>She sat down on the bed facing me with her legs apart just a bit, one of her hands on her bare thighs and two in her lap, as if stroking the flesh of her vagina. I took in every beautiful inch of her, seeing every hair that she had, the way her body had always been flawless and the way her breasts had always looked with her in a dress.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" she asked. "I'm sorry I couldn't last night, I really do have to go out to the store, or do some other work."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I just nodded my head. I looked at her and she looked at me again.
