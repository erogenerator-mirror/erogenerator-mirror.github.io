"There we go."</p> <p>I turned my head toward him and gave him a wink, then he pushed my hair back and kissed my forehead.</p> <p>"You smell delicious donks."</p> <p>I laughed, "I hope I can still smell you on me."</p> <p>"Yeah, I hope you can still taste me on you." He leaned and kissed once, softly at first, then more urgently. He nipped it between his teeth playfully. "We'll need more time to re-exchange," he added as he leaned toward me once more. "Let's make this night the best you can remember."</p> <p>I sighed. "So you and I getting re-acquainted?"</p> <p>"We did."</p> <p>He smiled and pulled me in for a lingering kiss, his tongue pressing into my mouth. "That'll start things off as good as it comes."</p> <p>"Well we're not even close to being close," I added as I broke away from him. "We shouldn't be here."</p> <p>He kissed my cheek and nodded. "Honey, we just got engaged, and we're still a couple."</p> <p>"Of course. I meant it when I said we should get engaged."</p> <p>He was right, of course. "But you never thought we'd get on really well."</p> <p>"You think because we're so involved that we'd be just like any other couple and never be separated?"</p> <p>I shook my head, "No. Well, maybe once in a while, but never unless we were really out of bed."</p> <p>He chuckled, "Well, I guess you were right, so maybe I should move in now." His eyes darkened a bit. "It looked like you had something on your mind tonight."</p> <p>I was not sure if it was an invitation, or a warning, but I think it had something to do with that. I laughed. "There's just something about you that makes me want to rip through that thin wall. And every single time you touch my body while I'm... in my mind, everything you do turns me on."</p> <p>He stared at me, his eyes not really on me. He turned back to the road, then leaned over to kiss me and I reached up and pulled him back down for another deep kiss this time. We were standing there in the parking lot, and I felt myself getting excited again from it, and my nipples were standing at attention as we continued to kiss. I could feel my pussy becoming damp and I knew if we continued any longer I would start to leak.</p> <p>Eventually we were done and he said, "Well, how do you like it? The back seat is hot."</p> <p>I stood and held my hand out to him. "Where am I sitting?"</p> <p>"Well, you were sitting on your lap so you're in the car, and since I'm here, I guess it would be okay." He grinned at me again and slid a hand over to my ass. "And you can ride me though."</p> <p>It may have felt good that I did, but I was feeling as uncomfortable as I was about being naked. It made me wish I'd shaved myself, or at least shaved off the hair there.</p> <p>"Um, what if I just drop them off for you?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, you'll need more than that. That wouldn't be right."</p> <p>He chuckled and then began walking toward the entrance. "It'd be the least I can do for you."</p> <p>I laughed, "I'm sure you are, but I wish the night didn't have to end like that."</p> <p>He stepped up to me, slid his hands up to my shoulders, slid his head down to my chest, and kissed my left nipple. "Oh, you just can't get enough of that?"</p> <p>I chuckled at his words, "That I could love."</p> <p>He raised his head at that. "Really?"</p> <p>"Really!" I laughed, "You want to ride me?"</p> <p>He sat back against the door and leaned against it. "I'll ride you the first few minutes and see what comes up. I have a surprise for you there later."</p> <p>"Okay," I nodded, "you take me home. I'll help you with the car."</p> <p>He smiled. "I'll drive while you go into the house and make an excuse to come back later."</p> <p>"Okay." I got off the car and walked around him, kissing him on the face and cheek and making my way to the front door, where I quickly got off the key, got back in my car and drove off.</p> <p>He followed me around for a minute, kissing me all the way over, and reaching down to caress my breasts again. He made his way back to me and they seemed to be a little larger thanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
