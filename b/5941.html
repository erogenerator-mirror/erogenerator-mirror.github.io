And for me it doesn't need to. It's a dead leave-over.</p> <p>"Don't go. What was it?"</p> <p>"You know. Some girl's idea of fun in town."</p> <p>She turns and smiles at me. She didn't have to say it. She knew her name was Sarah.</p> <p>"Oh," she says, putting her hand on her head, "I had a very enjoyable time. She was quite the sexy little minx, and I really was hoping to see her again."</p> <p>She starts to unbutton her shirt. "Would you like to see more?"</p> <p>"If you're sure. I might even let you help."</p> <p>Her smile is all I need. I undo her bra. My fingers barely have to take their time as they fumble with her nipples. My mouth starts to follow. She's so smooth, so firm. It's amazing not to know that only hours before I'd just been with her... I've been in bed with so many different girls before that sometimes just aren't worth taking time out, so I decide I'll just grab for the camera and snap a few shots.</p> <p>"What do you think? You can get a good-quality close-up," I say, my fingers squeezing her breast as my lips go to her nipple. Sarah isn't a big girl, so a bit soft is good. "That's better," I say, pulling my lips away just far enough so that I can see her.</p> <p>She's not just soft all over. It's firm and full from under her breasts just under her belly button. Her nipples don't seem so too big. They're sort of the size of silver dollars. Her stomach is flat but nicely round. Her ribs are nicely tight and her chest is even firmer than I remembered. I can see everything well enough to know she's not in an actual state of injury. But if I'm honest with myself, my mouth is wet just imagining what that would be like. Sarah is pretty flexible, doesn't that matter... I have a lot to learn about being with her.</p> <p>I move down and get to the end of her leg, feeling the muscle beneath her skin. I trace the top of her knee. I feel her body tense, but even with the thought of being with Sarah here again, I know that I still have a whole new idea of her body. I move back up and start to unbutton her shorts.</p> <p>"No," she says, smiling down at me. "Take it off."</p> <p>What? I know it's stupid. But she still has to come to my defense... her legs are pretty short.</p> <p>"No. Take it off. Please. The more I get dressed, the better. I know we're almost... almost... in love... but please, please, please..."</p> <p>She doesn't know what's happened, but she knows something is different. And she's not about to try to argue. The more she lets me get naked the easier it is to get back into character.</p> <p>"Sarah, get your head down low, so I won't have to bite."</p> <p>She complies, giving me a quizzical look.</p> <p>I move up and start to kiss her knee. She doesn't react. I know what that means... why does she keep smiling at me? What the hell does it all mean?</p> <p>"Please.... please," she says, the word barely audible. Her grip on the bed has relaxed.</p> <p>I start to kiss down her thigh and push the shorts off her hips. She doesn't say anything, but it's clear that she's willing. Her bare leg is smooth, hairless, and perfectly tanned. It isn't that she has a really pretty face, just the way it is when she's mad. She's a very attractive girl and I'm not in the mood to pounce with all eyes or ears. I can't be so damn sure I should ask her for an answer now... before I've got too...</p> <p>I'm right on the edge now. Now my lips are on her skin. I kiss a path over her and tease her a bit before moving back up her other thigh. Now I'm able to look at her face. She's just starting to turn...</p> <p>"Stop," she says.</p> <p>I do. But as soon as she stops her lips are back on mine. I'm sure she's wondering why I'm doing this. But the kiss is still soft and short. No, no, no. I know she'll be coming to me tomorrow... I know I'm the only person in the universe who doesn't have the capacity to kiss herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
