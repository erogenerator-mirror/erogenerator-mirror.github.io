On the surface this was quite normal for us. But my mind was screaming to me, "No! You mustn't."</p> <p>"You mean," she kept talking, "because of what . . . what my husband did to you when . . . when you were a little."</p> <p>There was no denying that my husband was my husband. But now . . . now I was getting turned on and I can't explain it in words. This woman was playing with me, I guess. But I had to know for certain, if I could get her to give me what she really wanted before she came back to fuck me.</p> <p>"But the more that I thought about it that I . . . I . . . It couldn't be, could it?"</p> <p>"It wasn't you. I could hear myself talking about it then."</p> <p>"But it wasn't anything like that. I don't know what you were thinking . . . but I don't want to sound stupid, but . . . but I'm sure as hell not saying no to what you wanted. I think that's what you wanted wasn't it?"</p> <p>She paused, as if letting me catch on. Was this her way of telling me that she was more than willing to give me what she wanted. And that's not what she wanted, is it? I thought . . . but then I was on the verge, and if I stopped speaking, whatever she would say, it was my choice. "Look," I said, "that just might be a lot for one or both of us, but I've got to have it here, right now."</p> <p>She stood and walked slowly away from me, then said softly. "Can you give it to me for me now?"</p> <p>I nodded. As much as I wanted to know what it was going to get me, I wanted to know that I had to be sure to give it.</p> <p>I watched her carefully, and realized that now that her intentions might be to get me, I really couldn't help but follow her. Now I was really wondering what she thought of me.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. Finally!</p> <p>There are three things which I should do here. The first, is start to strip.</p> <p>I'm not quite sure how I should feel about this, although I would never deny it. The second thing is a little awkward. And the third thing, is to ask for it. And that's how I always did.</p> <p>"Will you go to her and give it to me?"</p> <p>"Why?" I asked, trying to keep eye contact.</p> <p>"So that you can make her understand that you've lost your mind, that you're not just interested in sex."</p> <p>I hesitated. "I think it's best to try . . . to understand that there isn't any reason for me to be looking for someone to screw like that."</p> <p>"What makes you think you might want to screw another girl?" she said softly, and I could feel her eyes on my very exposed parts. "You're pretty cute, aren't you? So . . . we could try it. I mean, I kind of do look at you, and . . ." She hesitated, then added "and I'd really like that, too."</p> <p>So here I was, in a dark alleyway, trying to be the seductress to a middle-aged, married man. I'm not exactly a bad looking guy, if you look close enough, but it might be a little hypocritical if I said, "I like what I see, no strings." However, as much as I wanted to be able to just say "I'm really attracted to you and you must think I'm an idiot" but, to be honest, that wasn't my intention in any way.</p> <p>Still, I couldn't pass this up. "But I'm afraid that if I try to do it, I'll never have enough control over what I do. I'm pretty big, and . . ." Now I was feeling defensive, I just wasn't sure exactly what the point of this could be worth doing. I mean, if I was to try it with Kim, it would be as much to have control over the circumstances as it would be with my wife. So, instead, I said "I want my clothes off."</p> <p>That made her smile. Well, that's all I could do in the way that she said "My clothes off" again, but I didn't give anyone a chance to respond. She stood in front of me with her hand on her hip. She moved her head back and forth and looked right into my eyes as she slowly unbuttonedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
