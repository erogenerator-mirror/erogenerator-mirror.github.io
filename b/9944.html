I yelled, "What about my wife? Will you leave me alone with them? Will you marry me when they all get me?" I yelled at them.</p> <p>"No honey...we will take it as it comes," said Amy.</p> <p>"But we are just friends. We need to keep it on our own." I argued back.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter now. We were friends for a couple of years. We will stay friends. We all will. Now tell me to get it on with my husband." I shouted at her. "I get it!" Amy said sarcastically.</p> <p>"I said get it!" I yelled again. "I love you and you will always keep it together. Just don't go and cheat with your husband."</p> <p>Amy had nothing left to say about me fucking my wife on my wedding night, so she stormed through the house and stormed out, slamming the door!</p> <p>I was about to argue with her when she stormed through the house, slamming the door too! I was in pain. I turned on my computer and started reading. I was trying to get over this shit with Tom. I kept picturing her being fucked by her lover while it crossed my mind. I kept thinking of how I could go back and divorce her, but I didn't. Then I realized that I hadn't even read "Amen" yet, so all of this was probably for the best. I didn't even go and leave her side. Tom had done that to me. I would do my best to get past that, but it had been so long.</p> <p>I began to read more of "Amen" when I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was the first time I'd been touched by anyone and then I was in my bedroom masturbating while reading a fantasy story! I never looked at anyone before, not even when Tom fucked my wife! I turned the page of my book while reading "Amen" about how he really had made her pregnant! I was so turned on, I didn't even try to stop the masturbation.</p> <p>I closed the book and threw it on my desk before grabbing my handbag. I went back to my side of the bed; I was just about to start getting my phone out to text Tom when I heard his voice,</p> <p>"I'm going to the city for the weekend. I might get back at night but that's ok. Please make me feel better."</p> <p>I closed my eyes as my hand found mine.</p> <p>"We're leaving in two weeks. I really like you, you know." I could hear the disappointment in his voice.</p> <p>"That was a dream I had," my brain thought. I knew it wasn't something I'd dreamt of, but even a dream could hurt!</p> <p>The next day at work I was feeling a little better because I was working so hard. I was going to have an early dinner tonight with my boss at the department he worked in, including a guy named Mr. Johnson who kept telling me he's very sweet! It was actually a relief to have everyone leave at 8:00 the next morning and it was actually the hottest one I'd had in a while. The thought of having sex with Mr. Johnson again excited me like nothing else I had ever experienced! At that point I just didn't know what to do.</p> <p>Before work the next day, I spent the day talking with Mr. Johnson, we discussed the proposal and decided it was worth the risk. Mr. Johnson was a man of many interests and I had to put it off as long as I could. He was also my boss, so I knew he wouldn't judge me for what I had on my mind. He was definitely straight, so I asked him out on the phone as soon as possible as well. We discussed my decision and he agreed, so now we were ready to make our plans. I was going to have to work hard to get to the job site in time and it would only be a short time I would be gone.</p> <p>I was thinking about it that night when I got home after my evening with Tom. I was so horny. It was late and the smell of Amy's sex on my fingers turned me on even more because it wasn't that she'd been cheating with her husband, but he'd been making an attempt to persuade me to have a threesome. I could tell that she was excited about it, too. Tom couldn't make it. I knew I could never get bored with seeing her every night. I just liked being around him!</p> <p>My mind was running wild as I went down the stairs in search of my wife. There she was, sitting on our bed with her lover Mark, looking hot, too! My mind was in a whirl! I was thinking of fucking Amy for Tom at the same time Mark kept telling me he wanted me!
