I would never get to see her again but knew she never got to see me either.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll catch you tomorrow," she said. I watched her as she walked off and knew she was going to be gone for a long time. I felt a sudden rush of adrenaline rush to get away from this woman and go to bed. I ran after her and jumped into her car and drove around for a while before finding what I was looking for. When I got back to the hotel room I closed the door and got into the shower. I lathered up my body quickly and washed away the sweat and sex on the way. I looked in the mirror, still a little out of breath from running, thinking the worst. My eyes fell to the large bottle of wine I bought at the local wine store and thought I saw a smirk on her face. I could see my jaw drop again. "What the fuck," I thought.</p> <p>As I was pulling out the box of wine I heard her come back out of the bedroom, followed by the sound of her heels scraping the tile on the bedroom floor. I had to sit still. She looked at this man next to her and noticed that it was me. "Hey, baby!" she said, trying to be nice, but failing miserably. I felt like I was going to vomit but was too overcome with emotion to stop and put my arms around her.</p> <p>"I'm going to have to leave you now," I heard him say in my ear.</p> <p>I pushed her away and stood up. I looked around her. It was still dark out and I could feel my eyes start to pierce through the blind. She was in the shower and I couldn't help but ask her if she had a towel on. "Here you are," she said, pointing to the small towel hanging down the back of it.</p> <p>"I'm in there! We're going to party," I said through the dry tears welling up in my eyes while trying to hold back my temper.</p> <p>"No," she said, shaking her head. "This is my place right now. You're going to be back at work tomorrow and I'll be home all day without getting to use your bathroom."</p> <p>"But you just used mine and it was only my shower!" It wasn't so much that I said 'bathroom' but rather she said 'my bathroom.' "Besides," I said, "I didn't think you would be able to keep it down for more than six months." She looked surprised. "Oh, God."</p> <p>"Yes," she sighed, "but we still can use another shower, right?" I was beginning to feel better and I looked over again at the small bathroom. A shower? The whole house must be hers.</p> <p>"Yes, right here." I looked at her, "Do you want to go for a pee?" There was no way she didn't hear.</p> <p>"No," she said. "That's the end of it. I was going to try to go for a piss in your shower, but you had to make me do that," she said and then closed her mouth around the towel in front of her and tried to pull away from it.</p> <p>"You did nothing wrong! If you want me to let you go pee all you have to do is drop the towel and sit on it. I can put it into the shower and turn it off when I'm done with it."</p> <p>"We can sit in the shower together," she said as she opened the bathroom door and stepped out of the shower with her hands by her side.</p> <p>"You aren't going to be able to do this, that way we can go ahead." At her words I walked across the tile floor and put one of the spare towels around each of us. It felt as if a weight was lifted from the body and one day a new body would be ready to fit my body and the new body would be a more mature lover. I looked at her and realized she wasn't really angry. I put my arms around her and held her. All those months of tension was finally lifted and we would just have our first kiss.</p> <p>"Do you want me to put the bottle in the shower?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered, "just turn it on." I turned on the light and stepped out of the shower and got into my towel. I turned around to face her again and put my arms around her from behind. She looked over her shoulder in anticipation while putting the towel away from her body. I felt her body press against mine even more than before. We looked into each other's eyes while her hands moved all over my bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
