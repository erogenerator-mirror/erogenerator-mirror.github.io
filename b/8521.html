You're just getting a taste of me," I stammered, and gave her a huge and wet kiss. "How else could I have found out I was such an idiot?"</p> <p>"That was awesome," she smiled before kissing me again.</p> <p>"So, are you coming over to pick up my truck tonight?"</p> <p>"I don't think I can drive tomorrow morning."</p> <p>"I'm good to go."</p> <p>She left me again and I sat on the edge of our king-sized bed in a daze. I looked around the room and noticed all my clothes were gone, although I wasn't sure what they were. I found my wallet and the keys back in my coat pocket; there wasn't room for my pants or anything; the key was in my hand. I slid it back into my pocket.</p> <p>I picked the right car and had a short drive to her place. I parked and looked around as I walked around the lot; one man walking towards me. They were all tall, but shorter than me by at least 10 inches. I stopped a little distance away then turned back.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Jason," I said holding out my hand and hoping they wouldn't notice my huge hand. I had never felt or grabbed an uncut cock before, and felt myself hardening. I smiled at them all, and said, "I'm Steve."</p> <p>The man standing in front of me, a blond, took both my hands and held them up together. He looked to be in his mid 30's about 6 inches taller. His face was beautiful. He had blue eyes, a mustache and mustache that had that cute and funny scruff like people do around a lot of people. He had a very thin, short hair and his eyes reminded me of a cat with no teeth.</p> <p>"Hi Steve," he said holding both hands up to his forehead, "I'm Jason."</p> <p>As I shook his hands, they seemed to take a little extra effort to move them and felt like I was trying to shake them off. They looked different too. The guy had thick wavy hair that flowed down in a short cut across his forehead to his chin but in his face was a little bit of hair and a bit of stubble on his face. It was the face I remembered from the gym with the large beard just above his eyes. I had the feeling that they did have a few differences. Not too many, not too few, just a few. He also had very large eyes, almost a black, deep brown color, and as I looked closer I thought that I could recognize them with a little of the same color.</p> <p>They moved their hands and held them up as I shook each of them. I looked closer as I shook them and noticed just how big a difference in height there really was, if not around. The guy's eyes were very similar to mine and I was sure he had them from a distance.</p> <p>"Hi there," Jason said.</p> <p>"Hi, yourself," I smiled, "I'm Sam."</p> <p>"Hi Sam, I'm Steven," he said extending his hand.</p> <p>My eyes dropped down his thin, short, but muscular arms and they were a lot lighter than mine.</p> <p>As soon as I shook them I asked, "So, what do you drink Steve?"</p> <p>The guy had me in a weird place, and it made me nervous that his hand would touch my cock and I'd wake to his hand stroking me. I looked at Jason and said, "I don't care about anything, just get in it."</p> <p>After we got in the vehicle, Jason pulled me close to him and said, "I'm going to introduce myself now and then. I just know how to get what I want from you and then get what I'm after without having to try."</p> <p>"Yes," I smiled. "I'm Jason."</p> <p>"You don't have to do that," he grinned. "I'm sure you have someone you fancy looking after you while I get this job."</p> <p>"Yeah, the job is going to be easy without you," I chuckled.</p> <p>"So tell me about yourself; I'm going to get a ride back before you really do get your hands on my girlfriend. You won't be able to get her to let me go."</p> <p>"No, you won't get that lucky," I smiled.</p> <p>"Why do you say that when you said that you might?" he grinned.</p> <p>"Okay, I'm just going to run by her and I'll see if there is a way we can catch her alone," I said with a grin.</p> <p>"You better; I don't want you catching her."</p> <p>"Noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
