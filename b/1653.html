"That's a good girl" he purred, giving me a squeeze and a playful swat to my ass.</p> <p>"Fuck y...a..that was hot." I said as I was scooping my clothes up and putting them up on the hook by the door.</p> <p>His grin widened as he moved to pick me up, kissing and licking the entire way. My mind was racing with the possibilities of what may follow tomorrow. I could just lie there and enjoy the moment as I was in reality. And what if he doesn't last the rest of the night? I wasn't going to try to get too deep into it without having the night ruined.</p> <p>"Now, you," he commanded, walking me over and placing myself up on the bed.</p> <p>I looked at him in shock. "You want another lesson?" I asked, rubbing my thighs together as my pussy was slowly growing wetter.</p> <p>"No. I want you to go first," he said firmly.</p> <p>I didn't have to answer. With him there, we'd be in charge as he lay me down on top of the covers, pulling my shorts off and starting to undress me. But instead, he started to kiss my breasts, leaving wet trails up the length of them, making them tingle. I had no idea if it was possible to feel as wet between my legs as it was between his lips.</p> <p>He trailed kisses around my breasts, sucking and nibbling on my sensitive nipples before he moved to my stomach, giving my belly a playful lick as his hand traced up my leg, making it jiggle with each pass of his tongue.</p> <p>I spread my legs as he went higher. "Please...?" I moaned, almost pleading with him. I never could find words like that. He gave me a wink, and continued to lick my pussy, making me feel light headed from being so close to orgasm. When he brought his cock into view from underneath, I felt the head press against me. He was already fully hard, and so I opened my legs a little more so he could get his dick inside me.</p> <p>He slid a finger into my vagina, then quickly pulled it out and lined them up with my clitoris. Before I could react, he pulled his penis back inside me, and I started to moan. I didn't realize he'd stopped fingering me for a second, and I didn't stop the second orgasm I was feeling from his touch. He started pumping a little faster now, making me moan even louder and thrust harder against his hand, making me buck all over the bed as I came. I was coming all over his hand again, and he pulled his hand out when I came, covering himself with wetness from me.</p> <p>He rolled back onto his back and pulled me on top of him so my lips were over his for a while. He started kissing and biting my neck and shoulders, and I couldn't hold back any longer, begging to be allowed to come again. My body was shaking with pleasure as his fingers left my pussy and entered me, pushing me over, making me lose all control.</p> <p>I went limp underneath him as I came again, making a gushing noise as my climax hit. He continued to kiss and lick me as I trembled around his fingers and face, my legs quivering with aftershock as his fingers slowly entered my body. I collapsed against him, and he wrapped his arms around me as I settled into his lap, and fell asleep with his erection inside me. I could feel every inch of his dick as he lay against my chest, and I could hear his heart beating.</p> <p>In the middle of the night, he stirred, and I felt his hard penis against my clit as he held me close. I opened my eyes and saw his eyes staring at me, looking down at me, stroking my back.</p> <p>"Why don't you rest up for a little while?" I could feel it, even at this point. I nodded my head, and he kissed my cheek. "Sleep good" he whispered, stroking my back. I laid down beside him and curled up next to him, making soft noises as I drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I woke up the next morning, having been asleep for almost a half-hour when something felt different. I opened wide and saw that there were two cocks to choose from between my legs: mine and his. The one in my vagina felt odd, but I didn't care. I started to stroke the other one as they kissed me and cuddled me, both of them rubbing my body as they slept. I don't mean I wanted to, but it felt good being held like this.</p> <p>I woke up in the middle of the night in the sameâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
