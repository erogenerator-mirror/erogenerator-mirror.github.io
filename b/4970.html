She looked up at me.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said simply, "That was very, very nice."</p> <p>"Yes, definitely," I agreed.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked quietly. She looked down as though she was surprised to see the moisture from her lips and her breath, which seemed to have just gotten a little bit heavier, starting to come back on.</p> <p>I stood there with only my towel in my hand, the first time I had looked at her in such a way that she could tell just how I was feeling.</p> <p>"God you're beautiful," I said, not expecting much else to come out of it. She turned her head and kissed my cheek, one last time, and then broke away.</p> <p>"I like you too, I am," she said, stepping up to me.</p> <p>As she reached out for me, I could feel her body press up against mine, the curve of her lower back making me want to reach out, grab her and carry her to the bedroom.</p> <p>"I like that," I murmured. "You know that, don't you?"</p> <p>"It's what you do to me," she said, pulling me down to sit beside her on the bed, "it's what you do to me when you come and go and just hold me like that. It's how I feel when I'm close to you. And I always like it when you are close beside me."</p> <p>She paused with a pensive look on her face and said. "I used to be nervous, about you and about us sometimes."</p> <p>"I know," I agreed, "but I think it's a lot easier to just be with someone as close as a friend of mine."</p> <p>"And she's still talking to you?" she asked, seeming slightly confused.</p> <p>"She's still talking to me," I said, "I'm just helping her with her problems."</p> <p>"How are you able to talk to her?" she asked.</p> <p>"She can't," I said, "she's a friend. I don't mind telling her. She can tell me anything that happens, or even if it happens too quickly. My wife, who's been very, very lonely with me."</p> <p>"She'll help you with them," she said, "and I doubt you or she need to be talking to her to do it to him. So don't tell her that. She won't know he's talking to you, but it's still nice to just sit there and look at each other."</p> <p>She looked away at my expression of dismay that she saw a little spark of hope in my eyes. "What's wrong with her? Is she too young and immature? How would you feel if she suddenly turned ten and started to take on a life or maybe one of your kids?" she worried, "I don't want you to think I'm the immature kind of person."</p> <p>"I don't."</p> <p>"What? You don't think I'm too young?" she said, looking at me. "I mean, I still haven't found a man I can talk to about things I'm comfortable with. I just don't think you have to like me, to understand just how young I really am. It's just going to take time. But sometimes it just comes out, yes, that's it. For me, it takes time and it can be hard to make progress."</p> <p>"I can understand that, I suppose," I said, reaching for her hand again, "I guess I was always worried that you weren't doing anything because you're too young."</p> <p>"No, you were never," she assured me, "at least, not like that. I didn't want the boys at school trying to pick me up and hold me when they were looking at me, or like they used to do, or at me in the parking lot at school. You were the only one who knew what they were looking at."</p> <p>"What did you do, then?" I asked hopefully.</p> <p>"I liked it."</p> <p>"And I liked it when you kissed me because you told me not to be surprised at anything that happened," she revealed, "although sometimes it was even hard to be surprised that it was you."</p> <p>I nodded in agreement. I really wasn't surprised by her little confession, not at all. But I wasn't about to admit it to my own daughter, either.</p> <p>I leaned in and kissed her cheek and neck. "I enjoyed talking to you, and I want to do it again," I promised. Then added, "and maybe we can do it here with my wife in our bed."</p> <p>I didn't think my daughter would understand my intent, or perhaps she wouldn't either.</p> <p>And, anyway, what Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
