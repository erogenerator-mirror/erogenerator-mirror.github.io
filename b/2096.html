"There's a place you can get a really long walk."</p> <p>"Yeah, I could take a walk," I laugh. "I might even like that."</p> <p>"Come on, sweetie. Let's go there," she says, and we walk down towards the lake. "There's a lot of people. We should walk naked if we're going to the lake." I agree with her and lead her down the path toward where they began. The night is still young and there's still some chance, but I'm not so inclined to risk it.</p> <p>The moon rises up and reflects on the water, the faint sound of the waves breaking against the trees seems to come from where we're going. I look over my shoulder and look down at her, which she stares back up into my eyes. The moonlight gives that same eerie glow, which is exactly what she has been doing the last couple hours. I feel my heart start to pound and my breath go faster as I feel the heat of her body, and I look into her eyes where they are a bit wide but smiling.</p> <p>"We're going to the middle of the lake," I say softly. "I could feel her moving inside me last night and I feel the same way about this time." I look back up and we are at the edge of the lake. The dark blue waves begin to rise up from the lake and they run under the surface again, crashing against the shore. I turn and walk down the trail to the edge where the water's coming in.</p> <p>As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I reach her, and our eyes meet once again. I reach out for her hand and we walk back up the trail, through the dark forest where there's none of the light from the moon above our heads. The moon is out just before we begin walking, and it's a perfect night. She stops and stares up into my eyes as we walk along for a moment, watching my face, which is flushed red from the exertion of walking in the dark.</p> <p>"You're really hard," she says, and I laugh and nod as we turn to face down the other end of the trail. I know in my heart that I'm really as hard as hell and that I'm going to miss out this time with my hot girlfriend.</p> <p>"So I'm going to enjoy the show."</p> <p>"You're such a liar."</p> <p>"Hey, that was nothing," I mock, but she's not so inelegant to put up with such self-importance. "I think it got something else going tonight, didn't it?"</p> <p>"Well, you're so hard that you're nearly hurting."</p> <p>"So that's a thank you for making me hard. Why?"</p> <p>"Because you're so hard that the only thing I'm enjoying is being your girlfriend."</p> <p>She sighs and her eyes widen a bit. "I'm enjoying that," she says, and I smile in response. "You're so hard."</p> <p>"And you're feeling good about it."</p> <p>"'Oh I'm feeling good about it' is such a cliché," she says, "and it's so good that I just can't stop feeling good about the whole thing. I wish you'd do it to me so many times."</p> <p>"If you don't want to do it for someone," I say, "you're a little too easy on the eyes tonight." She gives me a sly look and then leans closer. As I step towards her, I have to move and lean back a bit to let her in just a bit.</p> <p>"You're right," I say. "I really need to get into that. I'm sorry, I just need some time to think about what you're doing tonight."</p> <p>"It's OK," she says, "It's not like you or I really don't enjoy the view," she says with a chuckle. "At least I don't think you do."</p> <p>"Yeah, no kidding," I shake my head. But I'm definitely going to enjoy it all.</p> <p>After looking at her in the moonlight, for a minute or two I make her say anything. Like I said, it's not so much that I am enjoying it (I don't know why we didn't meet) as it is that I'm not so sure I want to. We walk over to the waterfall on another rock. There's a pool in the middle of it, and there's some pretty serious sex out in the water. We walk along on this grassy rock, and my feet start to ache. We stop a couple inches from the bottom of the pool, and I take her hand—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
