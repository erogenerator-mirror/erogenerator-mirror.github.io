Toni asked the question aloud since her eyes fell on one particular part of his body that she had noticed earlier on her own, and she looked it over curiously.</p> <p>"Nothing."</p> <p>"Then you have her to fight for your honor."</p> <p>"You'd have to be crazy to think that, Toni. I can't be her enemy."</p> <p>"Are you serious? I was never even with her before – "</p> <p>"Well, you aren't, and you know it. She's an enemy – a piece of filth that I'd rather not have in my house. We can't just leave her here to stew in that."</p> <p>"Don't you think you can help keep this together and protect the girl a little?"</p> <p>"I don't believe that she's been doing bad for once. I just love that she's finally going to be able to start enjoying herself, you know?"</p> <p>"I'm so glad. I'd have done the same for you."</p> <p>She laughed and then laughed some more as well. It was the first time he had heard her laugh. At first he thought she had to hate him for it, but now he was glad he had learned her name before. The only problem was that his own nickname had only gotten him in trouble once, and that was before he became a lawyer. His own name – he had called it 'the man' in school, but everyone thought it was more of a nickname that could be used when he wanted to use the wrong people, so he had changed every name he hated as a kid. After the first year in the army he had changed his surname to Tom Jones – at first it hadn't been that far to him, but eventually as he began dating women at a much shorter distance and started to lose his identity, it went on. Tom used to be an actor, and he had become one of two brothers whose roles he never met again. It was with a few more drinks and games that he had finally learned the real world. It was, after all, the life of the party.</p> <p>They talked for a while, and then had to get out so he could get his car and they got going.</p> <p>"We know you like to watch your wife's pussy," she said.</p> <p>"It doesn't bother you?"</p> <p>She smiled. "I didn't mean to say."</p> <p>When she opened the door and turned around to look at him, he almost forgot what they were doing. She looked as wet as he had the first time he saw her. Her pussy was already glistening with her juices before her legs had even kicked in. Her tits were firm and round and her nipples were hard and long and stuck out quite obviously. Her eyes were still locked on his as she shook them at him.</p> <p>"Come in and we'll give you a tour of my house."</p> <p>Even though the last couple weeks he had been alone with her had had been really uneventful, there was one thing at least slightly different about her pussy. She was a lot like the first time he had had sex with her. He almost instantly felt his cock surge to life knowing the reason that she was so wet already. He found it exciting as their lips touched and she tasted as sweet as ever. He wanted to kiss her and put his tongue in between the lips of her pussy. But, as soon as his cock was as hard as it had ever been, he pushed her back against the door and reached up to take her tits in his hands. They were firm, and though she felt them hardening immediately, the flesh around them was soft and he squeezed them as he squeezed them. She moaned almost incoherently as he made his way down to her pussy, but once he was on his knees in front of her, she grabbed his head and held it there.</p> <p>"Just give it a lick," she whispered.</p> <p>He started to go back up again, but she stopped him.</p> <p>"Wait a bit," she breathed.</p> <p>"Like what?"</p> <p>"Your tongue," she replied.</p> <p>He began to rub his head through her open lips, but she suddenly shoved his head away.</p> <p>"Enough."</p> <p>He felt a drop of her juices slip off the head of his cock and run down his shaft. He immediately licked his own fingers, tasting her for a second time, and then began to push his tongue deep into her. She took his head in her mouth and began to suck it while moving her hips.</p> <p>"Lick me!"</p> <p>"I said lick me!"</p> <p>He pushed a little harder until he felt her hands on the back of his head and that brought him back to the task in earnest. He pushed further and deeper until he felt her legs part wide and he wanted—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
