"I'm not your girlfriend. Are you still playing with my legs?"</p> <p>"I'm not doing anything, I'm only giving you a foot massage."</p> <p>"There's more to my massage," she said sitting up. "But I want to feel it more, so I'll let you give me some."</p> <p>"You said you wanted to do me some things right," he told her.</p> <p>"Right, there was one thing I wanted to do for you. I wanted to feel your cock. I'm so wet I can feel it oozing out of me with each jerk of my leg. I wanted you to suck me off so I would know it wasn't because I really was gay."</p> <p>"I didn't think a man's cock wanted to suck you off, you're the hottest woman I've ever been with."</p> <p>"You still don't know how good you are with a cock, so I'm glad I let you suck me off. It feels so good, you're so good. I love to suck on a cock and to have you suck on my tits when it's hard. What a great job you've done with me."</p> <p>"My pleasure and your pleasure is always more important to me," he said as he reached down and put his hand in the waistband of her shorts. "Let me feel what you're doing to that big cock of yours."</p> <p>She lifted herself off the bed to allow him better access to her vagina, and he slipped two fingers up into her as far as he could go. He was surprised to find that she was well lubricated, and he could insert another finger without hurting her. He added his thumb to the mix, and the added pressure of his fingers brought forth an "Ohh!" from her and a shiver of pleasure in her. He moved his other hand towards the top of her legs, but she grabbed his wrist, and twisted it back, forcing his hand up her crotch against her vagina.</p> <p>"Oh, you're very wet and ready to go," he whispered as he pushed his fingers into her as far as he could.</p> <p>After a minute of this treatment she began moving her hips up and down. When he felt her body start to tremble, he leaned forward and kissed her.</p> <p>"That was great. I've always loved doing that," she said, her arms still around his neck.</p> <p>He sat watching her, watching her face change from the passion she was feeling to concern the heat that was building in her stomach from her trembling. She turned to look at him.</p> <p>"You really do want to do that, don't you? What if we do it again?"</p> <p>"That's OK," he said kissing her again. "It's not our fault we're so turned on, we can take it slow. It's not like I can be really mad at you for doing that to me. Are you?"</p> <p>"I don't want to be upset with you for giving the poor girl a foot massage. I think we could both benefit from being with you."</p> <p>"I think we need to know what we could do better than you can," he started to say as he kissed her.</p> <p>"I'm not ready to think about it," she said when she realized what she said. She closed her eyes and kissed him, then said, "I'm almost there. Let's get rid of this robe and let's see what we can do to fix things."</p> <p>"OK, let's," he said, pulling her up to her feet.</p> <p>He helped her out of it, and she sat back down and pulled him into her again, wrapping her arms around his neck to hold him to her.</p> <p>"What do you want to do with the massage you promised me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me to do things? I'd never do that to you," he said, lifting his hand and placing it across her breasts.</p> <p>"You know I want you to."</p> <p>"But what if you feel that you can't?" she said lifting his hand over her left breast.</p> <p>"What if . . ."</p> <p>"I want you to give this girl some good foot massage."</p> <p>"I don't have that kind of massage!" she said, lifting his hand away as one of his large hands reached down for her hip.</p> <p>"That's right. We can both give her some good foot massage, and we'll both give you good foot massage, that would really be good."</p> <p>"No. Can't you just make sure it's done right?" she asked. "My boyfriend really won't be here."</p> <p>"There is nothing you can do right now," he said kissing her and rubbing her legâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
