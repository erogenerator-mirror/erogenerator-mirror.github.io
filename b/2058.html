The story that you read to me is a very good example of what you like to read. It isn't going to come from somewhere else. I will just skip it and get straight to it.</p> <p>My name is Dan, and I will share with you what I do.</p> <p>My name is Dan, and I will share with other you who like to read about my writing.</p> <p>I know there are others out here who know what I write about. Please let me know.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy the story and want to hear back from me again.</p> <p>Your friend.</p> <p>Love,</p> <p>Dan.</p> <p>The words seemed to be floating up in the air; there was just so much of it! He continued to read and reread it, and it was starting to feel like a chapter of the whole story. I knew I would have an erection later. I was already hard from reading the part about the story! But I didn't care. I couldn't stop.</p> <p>I closed my book and put it on the end table. I went to the sideboard and put the remote down. I took a small black handkerchief and ran it over the side, under the blanket. I could hear movement and giggling from inside. Then I turned the light off, which seemed to help some as the room was a little dimmer than normal. I looked up to get a nice long gaze at the man in the white robe. He was obviously naked under the robe. He had dark blond hair and eyes. He was standing there in a robe, looking at me.</p> <p>"Hey," was all he said. "I saw you in the room."</p> <p>He had the robe tied around the back, as I had not, and the whole thing seemed to be open enough to see a lot of my backside. I noticed from what he was looking at that his robe was tied shut. I thought about asking him a big question, but quickly changed my mind. Instead I took the handkerchief out of my pocket. I set it on the end table.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"My room, right?"</p> <p>"Right."</p> <p>"You don't need to take it off. It's okay."</p> <p>I took the handkerchief from him. "You just have to untie it," I said.</p> <p>"It's okay," he said, moving the robe even further. It was a light green color and had a wide strap at one shoulder.</p> <p>I took the handkerchief from him and untied it.</p> <p>"No," he said. "I have something I want to watch." The robe was open more. His cock was getting bigger, and I could almost see it.</p> <p>"Here," I said. "Give it to me."</p> <p>"What are you doing?" he asked. He didn't ask outright. He knew why we were watching each other.</p> <p>"I just want to see it, Dan."</p> <p>"Okay, fine."</p> <p>"Come sit down on the other side of the bed; I'll have another beer," I said.</p> <p>I put the robe back on and stood up, turning toward him, and sat down next to his chair.</p> <p>As I sat down, he stood up, and I got the feeling that he was walking toward me. There was a long wait.</p> <p>"Well, look who came in," he said and walked toward me. He lifted up the front of my robe and kissed me. The kiss was short. There was nothing sexual in it. It was only a kiss.</p> <p>He looked into my eyes for a long moment. Finally, he said, "Well, that was nice, wasn't it?"</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it," I said.</p> <p>I was still sitting with my eyes closed and my face reddened when he leaned down and kissed me again. He was still standing in front of me. Somehow I couldn't reach out and touch him.</p> <p>"Well," again he said softly, "you did well. Did you like watching me?"</p> <p>I didn't say anything.</p> <p>"What are you going to do with it?"</p> <p>"Well," I said, "if you're going to watch my body, I think we ought to start you and me kissing."</p> <p>He bent down and kissed me again and kissed me on the cheek. Then he put his arms around my waist and stood up, taking me by my hands.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do more than kiss?" he asked. "You wanted me to do more than kiss."</p> <p>"Yes," I replied.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do more than kiss?" he asked again.</p> <p>"Yes," I said this time.
