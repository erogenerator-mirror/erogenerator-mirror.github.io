It felt like it was time that he was gone.</p> <p>"You OK?" he asked, his tone a bit harsher than usual, and I realized he was asking me if I wanted to go see the new movie. He looked angry again, and I knew it was because he saw the way I was acting the way I was.</p> <p>The last thing I remembered was that we were walking through the park together and I said, "Well I have to get to bed."</p> <p>As he stopped and turned around, and looked at me for a few moments, I thought to myself, if I said that I had to say something.</p> <p>"You want to come with me?" I asked him, and he just smiled and nodded his head yes, as if saying that he would never forget how I was acting.</p> <p>As we headed out the door, I saw him turn and open up his backpack, then drop the rest of his backpack to the ground and climb into it.</p> <p>"This is where I work," he said as he tossed my backpack onto his shirt, "It's nice and warm here."</p> <p>I was puzzled by the mention of a working lunch. I hadn't really thought about what he liked, and I didn't realize it until the second I heard him say it. My eyes shot up to his face as he smiled. We got to the restaurant and he parked the truck close to the office.</p> <p>It was a great place to get to know someone, because I was beginning to think that when he was with me everything would be ok.</p> <p>The meal consisted of a salad, which tasted so good, and I asked him about what he liked about the food. We talked about work, about what was on the bookshelf, and he told me that he hated working in the office, and he didn't want to work long hours, and he said that he was just tired all the time, and if I went back into work that night, he wanted me to spend the night.</p> <p>He said that the job that he really wanted to do was an environmental engineer for a major oil company that was based in Canada. It was actually the only job they did in Canada, and they wanted to build it up a bit. I explained to the waiter that it was a large job, but the pay was really good and they did get some of the power in the city, so it didn't really seem like any big deal to them.</p> <p>He smiled at me again, and said, "You're just like me, all the work has to be done, and I do appreciate the work you do, because you make me feel so good! Do you have a special way of doing things?"</p> <p>"Well the job is all mine, and it's not just a job, it's just the job," I told him, and he got a smirk on his face.</p> <p>As I asked the waiter to take our order, I felt myself getting a little more and more into his company. He could tell all the time that I wanted nothing to do with it, so he stopped asking questions.</p> <p>When we got back to the office, he was waiting for me to leave the next day and leave it alone, and then asked me to go and "join him" for coffee.</p> <p>I felt a little awkward that he might like, but I also felt an attraction to him. So I said, "You said you would do it."</p> <p>He smiled widely at me as we walked into the office. I was feeling bolder now that I was really looking at him. His hand had slid onto my ass while we were walking in the office, and I could feel my breath quicken.</p> <p>When we got to the office, I went over to a coffee machine and grabbed some cups and started pouring the first cup for myself.</p> <p>"This job is all mine" he said, sitting down across from me. He sat with the machine on the other side of the table from me and I could feel how hard he had gotten.</p> <p>"The job was pretty easy, and I was pretty damn tired that night" I said, sipping my cup, "You know I only had a few glasses of wine, so I kind of feel pretty good, and I'd be willing to do anything you want."</p> <p>"You're free to do anything you want, I've told you about me."</p> <p>His hand came down on my thigh gently, and I let out a small moan.</p> <p>As I was drinking, I got a feeling that I wanted to come in my pants. I wanted to be used and used for my sexual needs so I could do whatever I wanted.</p> <p>The next thing that I felt was his soft lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
