I slipped both hands around her and squeezed her tits gently. I moved my lips down the cleavage to her large belly. I kissed and sucked on each of her thighs before easing out from under her. I moved my hands up the sides of her thighs and started to part them slightly exposing her lips. When I started to run my tongue along her lips I couldn't help but let out a soft gasp.</p> <p>She opened her legs wider and I slid my tongue underneath them, tracing her lips before sliding it towards her clit. The warmth of my mouth excited her by a thin sheen of sweat that glistened on her skin with each second of my tongue. I could smell her sex, which I could see had a slight musky smell of honey. I dipped my tongue into her body, licking her clit and pushing my tongue flat against it. I felt her body tense up slightly until I could feel the walls of her cunt rubbing against my tongue as she started to moan. I could hear her muffled cries of pleasure and she started to tremble slightly. I could feel her clit swell in my mouth and swell into itself as her juices began to flow in little spasms through out her body. I continued to tease her clit with my tongue as she moaned even louder and her grip tightened around my head. Her body convulsed slightly with each wave of her orgasm as she pushed her pussy against my mouth. I continued to press my tongue against it until finally she calmed.</p> <p>I eased my head back and stood up from her. With both hands on her I whispered that I wanted to keep my relationship with her just the way she wanted it to be. She simply nodded her head and sat up to pick her panties up. She laid the pile on the floor and put them on for me to wipe them clean. She sat down again and again we stood there before she took the opportunity to kiss me for a final time. Then she stood up to walk back into the bedroom with me following close behind.</p> <p>As soon as we went back into the lounge we couldn't help but notice that her husband and his wife were still in their bedroom watching the screen. She looked over to me for support and smiled, before turning her head towards him. I turned back towards her with a question in my eyes. "Did you enjoy watching me do something?" she said in a low voice. Her husband nodded his head, almost as if it had been planned. "He even let me see those beautiful lips of yours." she whispered to him. He nodded and she then leaned towards me. Taking my hand they moved away from the chair and onto the floor. When she had me sit up on the couch between her thighs she lifted her legs and spread them open wider. I sat back and leaned forwards, just a little more than two feet away from her pussy. She reached down and pulled my face towards hers. Without kissing me she guided my head between her lips. Her mouth was wet with her juices but I wasn't ready for the taste of her lips right away. Her taste was different with the taste of honey. She tasted different too. Her juices were so warm and slippery that I barely hesitated and plunged my tongue deeply into her vagina as she let out a gasp of pleasure. The feel of her soft flesh against my tongue sent another wave of pleasure through my entire body. I gently probed my tongue as far as I could into her vagina and began fucking it with it gently. Her taste was amazing. It was as if the sugar that she had been making up her juices was still there, but her taste was gone. Suddenly from the sensation of her juice on my tongue she pulled away from me. I stared at her puzzled by her desire for more of my attentions. I felt something press against my lips and looked up. My wife was looking down at me as I made love to her lips for the second time in two days. She grabbed the back of my head and pulled me further towards her. "Fuck! Yes! Please!" was all she said until she finally released me.</p> <p>She leaned back against the back of the sofa and opened her legs. She spread them wide and started to pull my head towards her crotch. It didn't take long for my tongue to find the opening. I quickly moved forwards and entered her with a broad thrust. Her lips were wet with her woman's juices. I licked along her folds and found her clitoris. She wrapped her fingers around my head so that I couldn't move. She started to caress it and I moved my tongue along her lips back onto her clitoris. My wife grabbed my hair and pulled me even closer towards her. I pushed hard with one hand against her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
