He was a hard worker, always punctual and always ready to see me or text me.</p> <p>At home, I had started to lose my weight as soon as he moved away, and I was only carrying a small amount of my clothes when I came home from work some mornings for a run.</p> <p>My husband had bought me a new lingerie set recently and I had loved seeing the contrast between the pale skin showing through my white lacy bra and firm supple body, and the deep dark red panties and matching G-string set in place of it.</p> <p>I loved the feeling of my pussy lips getting bigger and the feel of my inner lips getting harder as my juices started to trickle out.</p> <p>I took off my shirt to reveal my flat, tummy and perky breasts. The fabric was tight over the swell breasts, but I kept it loose enough to expose the smooth, lightly mochae complexion of my smooth pink nipples that I had recently bought a new bra that I had bought earlier.</p> <p>I was so happy that with a new bra, I didn't have to wear the other bras from my collection anymore.</p> <p>I was on my feet in only my underwear as I ran with my new lover to the bathroom and took them off and placed them back in the washing machine.</p> <p>I wanted to enjoy the warm feeling of our bodies together, as I held his face between my hands and kissed him, while I ran my fingers through his hair, which I had recently shaved myself when I started this new job at the small office, which was now filled with his long black hair.</p> <p>I looked down at my pussy and noticed a puddle beneath my black panties that had run down to my feet. I brought my leg over his crotch and gently touched the puddle, then brought my panties into my palm.</p> <p>I looked at him, with the dark hair which clung to my body, and smiled up at him.</p> <p>"That looks nice" I said, looking down at the puddle. He smiled and kissed me again as his hands caressed my back and his kisses deepened and he started to kiss between my breasts, which were barely covered by my bra, before starting to kiss my waist and up my waist to the swell of my mound he continued to go up.</p> <p>He reached his hand under the lace of my panties and felt the thin material. I could feel my heart beating fast as he kissed my pussy.</p> <p>"Hmmm... I guess your pussy hair is still very nice?" He said, moving his leg between mine. I moved it with a smile and said, "Thank you" and he continued kissing me.</p> <p>We were still going at this kind of sexual frenzy together like a couple of teenagers at their first date. I turned his face to me and kissed him, while he ran his hands on my stomach.</p> <p>My legs were on his chest as he slowly moved his mouth down, until his lips got to the softness of my belly. He kissed there and then lifted my panties up and started to lick and nibble at the area where my thighs had ridden up and down my body when I started to undress him.</p> <p>As he had been doing that to my husband, he kept taking deep, slow circles around my mound with his tongue as I tried to keep my pussy lips still.</p> <p>I took his arms from behind me, and took his hands inside the panties. As I did this, Mike raised his head up.</p> <p>I smiled.
