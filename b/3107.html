I asked.</p> <p>"Please don't. Please don't make me," she begged.</p> <p>"If you say no I'll call the cops!" I answered.</p> <p>"NO!!! Don't you think it's enough I want to die. Please don't tell Daddy, oh please," she begged.</p> <p>I smiled seeing her tears running down her cheeks. "You know I'd never do that but if you say yes you have a choice. You can go back in your life or I'll kill you. That will not change one bit."</p> <p>"Please don't kill me. I'm your daughter and I want to be a woman."</p> <p>I reached over and slapped her across the face. "Say it!"</p> <p>"Daddy, please don't do this," she pleaded. She got up and ran to the door. She was gone.</p> <p>When I came home she was sitting naked on the bed. I sat down beside her and wrapped my arm around her. She pulled my head close and kissed me. "I'm so sorry," she said quietly. I felt like a little boy being teased by my daddy. For a while we just sat there kissing. I could feel her hands wandering across my chest. Finally she stopped and lay back. She had a wicked laugh under her breath. "What was that for?"</p> <p>"This," I answered. I slipped my finger into her pussy. "Mmm. I'm still a virgin," I said.</p> <p>"That's good to know. I'm going to get tested so I'm not so sure," she said. I got up and went to the linen closet. After several trips I found what I was looking for. A plastic bag held some kind of birth control. One of the condom's was in the bag in the bottom. I quickly went into the bathroom and washed my hands and the rubber's in the bag then returned and found a rubber. I returned to the bed and handed it to her. "Will this work?</p> <p>"Yes! I love you." She opened her arms and embraced me as I rolled off the condom. "I'm so glad. I love you." She kissed me and laid her head on my chest.</p> <p>"Me too," I cried. We fell asleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>I woke the next morning to her arms around me. "What time is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, it's almost dinner time," she said. "Come on out so we can help mom and dad," she said.</p> <p>We picked our clothes up and were heading back to the dining room. We were in the family room and sitting by the fire watching the last of the sunsets. "Thank you Mom and Dad," I offered.</p> <p>"So what are you going to do this weekend after I come back?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know. I'd love to stay home and have dinner with us for a change."</p> <p>"So what do I do after?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you want to come back to my house?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't think I could," she said.</p> <p>"Then come back and I'll help you do whatever it is you'd like that I think you'd like." I said as I picked up a small bowl and bowl of soup and sat it down. "If I find it's OK if you give it to me after dinner then when do you want to come back."</p> <p>"When will you be home alone?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not until after the movie tomorrow. I want to see you before I go to sleep so we have plenty of time to talk."</p> <p>"That's great," she said. "How should I sleep?"</p> <p>I picked up the bowl of soup and spoon and sat it in front of her on the edge of the sofa. "Make yourself comfortable for a change. Maybe you can use the bathroom too." I added.</p> <p>"OK, that will do," she said.</p> <p>I was on my hands and knees in my bed when she came out of the bathroom about 10 minutes later. She stood in front of the bed with a towel around her shoulders and a bottle of cold wine in her hand. "Do you like wine?" I asked.</p> <p>"This one might be a little too thick for me. Please don't worry. It's all for your sakes." she said. She poured the wine into her glass and we drained it. She handed me the wine and I handed her the glass. She got one and went into the bathroom while I got the bowl. It was just after 9 so I had time to sit down in my chair and drink the wine.</p> <p>She came back into the room and handed the bowl to me.
