I thought I could see a tear rolling down her cheek again as she began to unbutton my pants. "Sorry I woke you up, but please don't think I was dreaming. Please."</p> <p>I felt my cock throbbing through the fabric. How could I possibly deny her? Of course she wasn't. I felt powerless. I was hers.</p> <p>Her hands went straight to the waist of my boxers. She grabbed the waistline in a firm grip and pulled outward from me, my hard cock pressing against the fabric of my boxers. I gasped in shock as she wrapped her right hand around the shaft, just barely managing to keep her hands in check.</p> <p>Then she yanked the fabric down my legs, letting it bunch around my ankles. A soft grunt escaped from my lips as my penis poked out through the fly. She pulled it up, past my knees and then back down, over her feet. Her legs were spread wide, as if my dick was her only chance to touch and caress me. But she was my wife. We were already a couple. And now, there wasn't even any reason to be shy. We had been married for twenty years and yet, I was hers too.</p> <p>I was completely hypnotized, with my mind completely focused on this woman who had just seen me naked. The vision itself was enough to trigger my orgasm again and I moaned desperately. My fingers trembled as I grabbed her around her tiny waist and pulled her down onto me.</p> <p>I was surprised at how hot I actually felt when we made love. It had been a long time coming, but it was clear that there was a level at which our love-making would be almost mechanical. But I was so used to her body and the urgency in her moans, it felt like I could feel every inch of her. Our bodies pressed together as we grinded together, her naked breasts smashed against my skin, my dick still buried deep inside of her. Our mutual moans were filled with passion, and she was completely into it.</p> <p>I was just about to pull my dick free from her when she placed her feet on the floor and pushed herself up so her breasts were pressed against my stomach. She looked down at me, her mouth hovering just inches from my cock, her tongue flicked out and she moaned. I couldn't believe how hot she looked, and she was completely naked. Her breasts still jiggled as she pulled, bouncing against the fabric of her shirt.</p> <p>"Oh...I...I'm going to have such a great day with this," I said, my voice barely a whisper.</p> <p>"Well," she said, moving closer to me on the couch. "I'm sure we can think of something. I could do with your dick too." She winked at me.</p> <p>Then I did feel her body pressing right in between my legs again. She wrapped her arms around me and pressed her naked breasts against my chest. "I need you," she said.</p> <p>I couldn't breathe, both of us barely breathing. She continued to hold me in a hug.</p> <p>"I'm so glad we aren't going to do anything today," she said, kissing me lightly on the forehead. "I really needed a rest today. Thank you for waking me up this morning." Her words were both romantic and sweet. I didn't know why she knew I needed a rest. We hadn't been making love for over a week. But still, it had been a long time.</p> <p>"I think I can say I'm glad you're ok," I said, trying to find some sense in the idea.</p> <p>She kissed me again. "It would probably be better if we made love, didn't we?"</p> <p>"If we were married," I said.</p> <p>"I know, but there is something else about you I have always enjoyed," she said. Her lips reached my ear, just above my earlobe. They seemed to beckon me toward her. "I never thought I'd ever actually see your body, but look what you're doing," she purred. "Come here," she said. She grabbed my hand and led me to the bedroom of our room. "Make me real happy," she said, her lips brushing lightly against my ear. She moved around me, pulling my shirt up over my head and tossing it aside.</p> <p>She continued to hold my hand, slowly, almost teasingly. "Come here," she said again. "Let me take care of you." She moved her lips to my chest, kissing my ribs, running her nails down my chest, teasing me. Every inch of skin she got to touch sent jolts through me, tingles in my nipples as they got harder and harder.
