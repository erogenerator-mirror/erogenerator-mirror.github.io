He took a seat in the passenger seat, and held her hand as he helped her out of the car. Her jacket covered her, which was more of a flannel. As he slid his hand on her bare thigh she pushed the jacket away and held it with her free hand. "You think your sexy is cute?" he said, and kissed her full on the lips, while pressing his lips to hers. She didn't really know what to respond so she just accepted the kiss, and they kissed until they were sure that it was finished.</p> <p>She put one arm around his neck while the other was around his waist. He didn't seem to mind. She had always liked the attention other women gave him, but he'd never seemed to give them too much pressure. He was still pretty good in bed but she doubted if he was a virgin, but there were still too many other men around with his average sized penis. He turned her to face him and began opening her jacket as she was reaching into the back of her jacket. As she reached through the coat she felt his left hand slip back to her knee as he undid her top button of her skirt. She had not worn a bra that day so his fingers felt smooth, and they were still warm from the kissing they'd just shared. He started to massage her right breast as she reached back and undid her top button, and then again as she slipped the top off her shoulders and unzipped her skirt.</p> <p>"Do you know how to open the blouse?" she asked. "I like it better this way."</p> <p>"I do," he responded as he let her skirt slide the rest of the way off, to a little more tussle now. He took his left hand from her breast and slid her skirt and blouse over her shoulders and down her arms, and tossed them on the floor. Her breasts looked larger than he remembered, especially in the dim light of the dash monitor. It wasn't that he didn't like to see them, although it was very flattering, but his sexual life seemed to be lacking in the bedroom. He began to fondle her right breast, and then started to suck the nipple. As he kissed her he took a second finger and rubbed her other nipple, one after the other. She began to moan as he played with her. He pulled her panties down and tossed them in the seat before lying her on the floor. As she spread her legs, he pushed his middle finger up her pussy, which opened slightly, and slowly slipped into her.</p> <p>He didn't get very far, but she couldn't help it because she had been turned on earlier, and he was still just as hard as when before. He pushed in a second time, and she realized that he was going too far. The other hand reached down and grabbed his penis. He pulled it out a bit, and then pushed it back in. His hand stroked her and she spread her legs even wider. She was so ready for him, she almost wanted him to come himself inside her. He pulled out and pushed back in, and they went on like that until he found her climax. She was so hot that he could feel his penis hardening in his hand.</p> <p>In the rear view mirror they watched his penis pumping in and out of her wet pussy, as she wrapped her legs around his butt to pull him in closer. She reached around and rubbed his penis, and then leaned back to stroke it, as he continued pushing and pumping. One hand left her breast to grip and rub her clitoris, and one hand kept it on her thigh. She was moaning and moving his penis in and out of her, and her breathing was heavier. It wasn't long before she pushed one last time and came hard, and he felt it, too. He stopped after her orgasm, but kept fucking her as she came. When it subsided, she laid there, and he got up to join her on the bed. He lay between her legs while she rubbed his cock.</p> <p>She didn't expect that he was a virgin, since they'd never spoken much about sex. He kissed her there and began eating her out. He used his middle finger to gently massage her anus as he moved it around, and then slid it in. She was really getting into this, and began to thrust her hips, as he worked his finger into her ass as well. She really liked being spanked, and she loved every spank and tug he gave her bottom. Finally she had one coming her way. She wasn't sure if it was what she was feeling or what, or whether it was just the fact that she didn't understand it. She just loved getting spanked or even had her butt spanked, and liked some variety of that even. Then she realized that it went the other way, so she reached back and started to fondle his balls some more. She had known it wouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
