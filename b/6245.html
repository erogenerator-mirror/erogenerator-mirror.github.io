I guess." He replied. Her face was beautiful and her breasts, if it was possible, were even bigger than he expected.</p> <p>"Would you mind if we went to the bathroom for a minute?" she asked, gesturing towards the room.</p> <p>"I'll be fine." Jake replied as he turned out the lights.</p> <p>"So. Do you want to get dressed or should I take the rest of the way here?" Jake asked as he stripped down all of the way and headed into the bathroom.</p> <p>"I'll be ready in a sec." she replied, joining him as quickly as she could.</p> <p>"No rush, do what you need to do!" she smiled as she wrapped both arms around him and pressed her naked body to his.</p> <p>"Thank you... so, soooooo much..." Jake's voice trailed off as Jake moved his lips close to hers. Her lips were strong and firm and after only a few moments of kissing he could feel his body reacting to hers in response. The kiss continued as Jake's hands explored her body, from her shoulders down to her hips and back again. Her breath was getting heavier, and he knew from the slight movements that her nipples were growing.</p> <p>He broke the kiss, "Oh, come on. Hurry up and get dressed. I'm hungry too." Jake said, smiling at her.</p> <p>"Yes, I will. Come on though, I have a treat for you too." She said, grabbing his hand and leading him to the couch. They laid down together, Jake on his back while Laura knelt next to him. She wrapped her legs around him and her head descended to him. Her mouth was warm and inviting, and he loved the fact that as she moved, she didn't want to be left out or neglected. The moment their lips touched, her hands began exploring his chest as he ran his hands through her hair. Her mouth travelled lower, trailing along his abs, to his groin. Jake was ready to explode, his body practically pulsing with pressure. She stopped only long enough to smile and stand up. Her pussy was soaking and tingling, with the anticipation of what was in store. Her breasts were smaller than he imagined, but not fat, but just the most perfect handful. Her mouth was poised just below her pussy, and her eyes flashed as she spread her legs. Her lips were glistening with moisture and he could imagine running his tongue between them, to her eager hole.</p> <p>He got his bearings, and took Laura's eyes from his face.</p> <p>"Ok? You ok?.. I can tell it's been a while." He said. Laura nodded, her lips curled up into a smile.</p> <p>"So you're really going to go for it, aren't you? So I can take pictures?" she asked, her hand slipping up and down her pussy as she spoke. Her eyes were glistening, her lips swollen, and she could already see that her nipples were rigid and ready.</p> <p>"I could definitely take the rest of the night off!" Jake said breathily. It made sense at the time, he had been looking forward to going with her for weeks, but now that his sexual stamina was coming to a mind-melting blow, he wanted more.</p> <p>Laura nodded again. "Ok. I'm just sorry..."</p> <p>"For what?" she asked, her eyes flicking away from his face to settle on his throbbing cock. As usual, his body was ready and willing. It couldn't go soft, but he would be damned if it wasn't going to feel as wonderful as it had that first time.</p> <p>"Can someone touch you?" she asked, leaning forward on him.</p> <p>"You? No... I mean, if you do that, please? We don't have to just move, and I'm not ready for this." Jake pleaded.</p> <p>"No, we won't. We haven't been intimate in so long, we've been waiting for what's next. Just touch me... get me turned on, whatever you want. If you want me, just put your hands down and do it."</p> <p>"Is there anything I can do to make you want to be with me more?" Jake asked, pulling Laura up towards him and kissing her lips.</p> <p>"I think that you can get even with me for this. My legs are a bit shaky from the last one, so if that's ok?"</p> <p>"Of course there is..." he said, pulling away from her. He kissed her again, passionately, as he slid his hands up her legs to her breasts. He squeezed them once, and whenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
