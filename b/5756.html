"I know he can get me with her in a good fashion."</p> <p>"I don't want you to think you are," I countered, "I am the one who's here. Please sit down. You'll love it!"</p> <p>I sat with both my hands under the table, the table in front of me and my head on the inside of my right foot. I felt the first drops of the wine in his glass, and I was surprised at the effect my touch was having on his body. He sat, too.</p> <p>"There's something you want?" he said quietly.</p> <p>"Oh, yes." I responded with a smile. He leaned forward and took one of my feet in his hands.</p> <p>"I can't have a foot rub."</p> <p>"Oh?" I asked. His fingers began to run across my legs. I felt both his hand on one of my legs, and I felt each leg rubbing on each other, rubbing both calves. His hands were moving up my shin. He was rubbing the underside of my foot, making me shiver. "I think I like the new side of yours," he commented, and I felt a shiver go through my body.</p> <p>He moved closer to me, still gently stroking both of my legs, and then he leaned in close to my mouth, his full breasts pushing against my chest and stomach, his erect nipples scraping my skin.</p> <p>"You really like that," he murmured. "I could spend a lot of my time with you, my darling, so how about it?"</p> <p>I knew what he was talking about. It could be all of my body, and I knew right where the touch was being rubbed. I reached up and gave him a kiss on his forehead. I knew this kiss would have to last - it had been a great first kiss, but what the hell.</p> <p>With my head back, I put my head on the table in front of me and opened my eyes to look at him.</p> <p>"You know what you want?"</p> <p>"What do I want?"</p> <p>He reached forward and touched the side of my face, his fingers tracing a line along my jaw and on down my neck, before lightly cupping one of my breasts. He ran a finger along the center of my top and back again. It was the sensation most erotic he had ever received. When he touched my nipple, I felt my body shiver and my breath catch in my mouth.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me?" he asked.</p> <p>"You're in control, baby," I said. "I need to be taken care of."</p> <p>He reached down and kissed my neck again, a light kiss. He moved his lips down through my hair and then licked it gently with the tip of his tongue. I couldn't help letting out a soft moan. Before I could think, I pulled away from him and pushed his shirt up while I sat there and watched his hands unbutton each button of his shirt. He pulled my shirt out and out of the waist, exposing that beautiful tanned torso. He ran his hands over and around each of my breasts, then back down to my skin. He ran his fingers down the side of my chest and back up. He pulled my shirt up and off of my body, leaving me completely naked.</p> <p>I sat there looking at him as he stood there in front of me, just staring. I couldn't help but feel a tiny bit of guilt for not looking him in the eye more earlier. But, I would do what I had to. He turned back around and looked at me. That beautiful smile lit his face.</p> <p>"Oh, you look delicious," he said. He reached down and picked up his glass.</p> <p>"How about a toast?" I said.</p> <p>"Okay," he replied.</p> <p>"To you and to your darling sister," he said, walking towards me and taking my glass. "And, yes, you did have fun with your friend." He raised his glass and clinked the end of his glass with mine.</p> <p>"I've told you," he said. "She was great, and you're always going to be happy with her as she is with you."</p> <p>I reached into my purse and pulled out a small handkerchief and some napkin, wrapping it up and set it in the end table next to the table. He took two of the napkins and set them in my hands to the table. He took me in his arms and held me.</p> <p>"I am happy with you," he murmured. "And you are always going to be with me."</p> <p>My hand wrapped around his back, and he held it for me as we both leaned ourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
