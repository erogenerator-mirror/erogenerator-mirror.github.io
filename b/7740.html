His chest was heaving as he fought to keep the heat from building, his face was flushed the way it did when his body burned for it. What a fool he'd been. He wanted to kiss her passionately and make a statement but could not. How the hell could he when she said so little?</p> <p>Sylvia tried to tell him she loved his body but only came out feeling sorry at what she had done to him. She wanted to make sure she had won. She wanted to show him. She didn't have to make his feelings known, if he wanted that much to show he was wrong and could never make her feel the way he made her feel.</p> <p>They both knew this time was special. It was time. "I'm not coming back."</p> <p>"Don't worry," Sylvia said. "If I go and get someone like John Holmes to give us a hug, we'll get the message and it'll be over."</p> <p>"Hurt is all good." He gave her a smile.</p> <p>Sylvia stepped up to her room and slipped into bed. "Is everything okay with you. You have had no more than one experience of me."</p> <p>"No," he said. He wanted nothing more than for it to never come between them again.</p> <p>He got up and went to the stove and started to fill the kettle. He would take it into town. He would be gone for three days and would stay if need be.</p> <p>He had already gone home and was still thinking about what had transpired yesterday. Sylvia, and her reaction, should she get married again. She said that to him as if he was cheating and the thought of it frightened him. If she had to get married, she should have no regrets. And yet, he was feeling guilty about that, maybe even if she did. He had also had sex with the girl he was going to marry at the same time. He could feel the guilt. If she had loved him as much as he loved her, he knew that a little more was still to be done. He would do it all again, he told himself.</p> <p>He got up to change and then went to the door. As he made the door open he felt the tears in his eyes. Even though I was no longer her friend, I felt special to her, he told himself. Then he thought about the others he had been with as well, but for the life of him he couldn't remember. There was always something missing. He'd found some one to tell. Maybe Sylvia. Maybe she'd be home with another man. He didn't have a care in the world. He'd never find a woman like her.</p> <p>He thought about going to bed, to have a nap, to wake up and start over but he couldn't. He just couldn't. After he had changed from his shirt, he took his clothes off and got into bed. He didn't want to wake up, to go to sleep too. He just kept thinking of his friend. He imagined meeting her again and again or having a long talk or meeting for dinner or even a drink with one of her friends. He didn't seem to want to go home.</p> <p>"I can't believe I did what I did yesterday," he said in his head. He got out of bed and went into the bathroom. He showered and got cleaned up. He put on jeans and a t-shirt and went out to meet her.</p> <p>The drive to Sylvia's house was about a 45-minute journey. As he walked up to the front door he saw the familiar look on her face even though she never showed it to him. Her skin was still flushed, she still seemed to be very upset and was making noises in her sleep.</p> <p>After they got onto her porch he walked to her door. "Sylvia, I can't believe I did that...it really was so quick, I mean I just made love to you. I mean it is so wrong I know but it still feels right and so right! I think you know why I did that. I love you with all my heart and I know you never want me to leave you. Well, maybe someday. I promise."</p> <p>"I know," she said. "I could be pregnant or something like that but I just can't make love to you. I don't want to cause any problems and I don't think we're being impulsive. I just want to see how it goes and I want to know so I don't hurt you or have an accident."</p> <p>"Okay," he said. "You're not pregnant if that makes any sense." He felt better knowing she was upset. "Anyway, let's go sit down and have a drink." He walked in to the kitchen and sat down in the seat opposite of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
