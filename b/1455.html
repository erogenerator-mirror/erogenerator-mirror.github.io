Oh yeah! Ohhh! Ohhhhhhhh!" she let go of her brother and fell to her knees in the middle of the bed. She wrapped her fists around his waist band and pushed him back against the mattress. She wanted to kiss him! she wanted him to come inside her.</p> <p>He looked her in the eyes and she looked back. He knew. She felt it. He'd been afraid she'd said yes. She was afraid he'd say no.</p> <p>"Please don't," she whispered between kisses. He did just that. He lifted her back up with his hands under her legs and lay her back across the bed. He pulled down the top of her jeans, pulled her shirt up over her head, and dropped his pants to the floor. His cock was hard and throbbing against her. The thought excited and scared her. She didn't want his cock inside her, but she liked when he pulled her to him.</p> <p>He rolled her on to her front and pulled her hips back toward his hip. He knelt on the mattress then, pulled the crotch of her panties to the side, and pushed himself into her.</p> <p>"OH!" she exclaimed as her brother's erection spread her inside. She clutched her arms around his neck. She knew he was inside her as he humped her. Her pussy clasped him. His hips were moving, sliding back and forth, back and forth in perfect unison.</p> <p>"Oh!" she cried when they first joined together. He was kissing as he held her hips in his hands and her waist in his hand, holding her. He was moving inside her as if he was sliding out of her again and again. She came. He felt it. They came as one.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Her husband had said she was great at cunnilingus. He didn't know what she thought. He was in a marriage so strange that he couldn't even ask her if she liked it. He really couldn't say her name. When he had her in the middle of the night, he'd force her, even force her to do things to him. She knew it was a sin to try to make his mind up, but she didn't want to do it. She couldn't do it.</p> <p>But she'd had no control. Sometimes she'd get to the point that she could just reach under and find her clitoris again, but she'd be disappointed. Then she'd look up and go back to the way she had been when she really got carried away. The way she'd wanted to. Why was it different?</p> <p>She remembered what had happened. She remembered how he'd forced her. That it was okay. He'd taken care of her. He'd helped her get over her fear and get back on her feet. But somehow, she'd still felt that it was wrong. He'd made her feel good just as, she remembered, he'd given her pleasure. She'd been happy to have him in her body, making her climax. Now, she was happy nothing would make it wrong. She was happy to be back on her feet again, back in control.</p> <p>Her husband saw her like that. He had always been proud of her self-confidence. She had that look in her eyes, her smile. This was what she had been missing all the time. It was a look of happiness in itself. It said everything about her life, her family and home. He could never have her believe she didn't need him. This is exactly what she needed.</p> <p>"I guess that's all that's important to you," he said.</p> <p>"Maybe," she said. "Maybe, maybe."</p> <p>"Maybe? That's not even close to what you wanted at all. Was I as good at it as you were?"</p> <p>"Oh, don't tell me you're afraid," she said. She had a hard time talking.</p> <p>"I think I was," he said.</p> <p>"You're right. That wasn't what I wanted at all. I wanted you. I didn't want to try. I didn't want anyone else. Then I made up my mind. Now I'm telling the truth. I didn't want anything else. Not that I really did."</p> <p>Kirsty was not afraid. She was flattered. He'd wanted her. He'd made her feel good. She wanted more. It wasn't right that she was ashamed by it. But now she wanted it. She wanted him, she wanted him to fuck her again. "Can I give you a blowjob?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course. Don't stop me."</p> <p>"Promise?" she asked with a little laugh.</p> <p>"I know, that's silly. I always thought it was a one time thing. This is not a one-time thing."</p> <p>"I know.
