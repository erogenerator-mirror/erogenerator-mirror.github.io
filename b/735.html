With a sigh, they fell asleep together, and were woken to the sound of a voice in the adjoining room. It was John, the one who had called in to check on her, and he was looking at her. They were both fully engorged again and were lying on their sides facing each other looking at each other. They were both breathing heavily as they smiled and kissed each other, then John started to caress her ass while they continued to kiss, when he felt the head of his cock touch hers. She reached between their bodies and touched it, then began to stroke it once more. That did it for John, after she had moved into position to enter her she moaned and started to work his cock, which was growing harder by the minute.</p> <p>They just lay on the bed, kissing while their hands moved and stroked over each other. She stroked his chest, working his nipples into prominence, before working her way down his belly, and she could feel him rising as she moved further down, until she felt his cock resting on her leg. She turned to him, and put her finger on his lips and whispered, "I love you, Baby," then she kissed him again. He kissed her back, then placed his hands on her shoulders. His fingers worked her neck and shoulders, while his hands worked her back, pulling on her shirt until it opened revealing her bra-less breasts. She took his hand and guided it under her shirt and squeezed her nipples while they kissed, and then her hands reached behind his neck and pulled him down to her, which they both happily kissed.</p> <p>In no time at all, his finger was at her pussy, exploring the silky folds of her pussy. She parted her legs to allow him better access. He slid his finger inside her, slowly at first, then steadily more and more with each insertion. They both moaned together and began to rub each other more with their hands, pushing and playing with their clits. She continued to kiss him and he started kissing her shoulder and neck as his finger found the right spot that drove her wild. Then he pulled his fingers out and slid his cock into her, almost coming before she could get him in her. They kissed, and held each other tighter, and started moving with rhythm, and both moved faster. Suddenly, she cried out and was almost on the bed when he felt her cum flow through the walls. He continued to fuck her and she came over and over, then held his face and kissed him. He pulled out of her and stood up. They came together and fell onto their sides. She was lying on her back, and he lay next to her and kissed her face and neck to get to her lips. He started sucking on her tongue so he could get more out, then he reached between us and rubbed his finger on her clit until she had a nice orgasm and then he moved his face down to her breast. She arched her back and moaned as he licked and sucked on her left nipple until it started to grow again. Then he slid his mouth down her body to her pussy. She put her legs behind his head and pulled it in as he ate her out. She was soon moaning and coming again and she pulled his face out from between her legs.</p> <p>He laid a pillow under her ass and she lifted her legs up so he could kiss them. He kissed them and licked them, paying special attention to her inner thighs where each time she started to come, he would kiss away from it and move his tongue to her clit. He kept that up until she was coming and then she laid beside him and said, "Honey, that was amazing."</p> <p>"It sure was," he replied.</p> <p>Later that evening they laid around the pool getting ready for the evening she wanted to be his wife. They were already naked when she slipped an arm around his waist and asked, "Why do you love me so much, when I am with you like this?"</p> <p>"Because you are my wife tonight, and I am yours until the morning, when it is your turn."</p> <p>"Honey, we will make love every morning and every night. I love you with all my heart."</p> <p>"Even if you get pregnant?"</p> <p>"It never makes sense to me, but I agree."</p> <p>"Okay, but I'll be careful."</p> <p>They kissed and laid in bed for a few minutes. Then they turned on their side, facing each other. They kissed again, then laid their heads on each other's breasts, looking into each other's eyes while they rubbed their cocks against the softness of the sheets. She began to kiss him, running her tongue over his ear and then kissed his face and neck, nibbling, licking, and sucking on his neck. He lifted her breast, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
