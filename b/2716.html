If you're a nice guy, I've got plenty of guys who'd like to be your date. It would be pretty funny."</p> <p>"We do kind of know each other," I agreed.</p> <p>"But, but..."</p> <p>"But no promises!"</p> <p>"I'll see you Friday, Mike. Thanks for the show!"</p> <p>"See ya," I smiled. "I can't wait to see all that stuff!"</p> <p>We got into the car and he said; "I don't think I'll ever be able to walk into a school tomorrow without a little ass walking around me."</p> <p>I laughed with him. "Then, you won't make it?"</p> <p>"I'll pick you up at the office after school and we'll head back to the office for the weekend. That should be plenty of time to talk."</p> <p>"You won't go to the mall with me, will you?" I looked at him suspiciously. I never got a chance to ask his opinion about my mom. My dad had me convinced that he never liked me. But, I like dad!</p> <p>"No, Mike. I like you just the way you are. And I don't think those guys think, they're jealous."</p> <p>"Okay," I said.</p> <p>"So, where are you going on Friday?"</p> <p>"I'm going to spend the weekend in town with a friend of mine. So don't worry if you see you or not."</p> <p>"That's okay. I have a class Monday."</p> <p>"But, what about your class?"</p> <p>"Wednesday, right after school, is the same. We'll have dinner and talk and then we'll catch all of the sights we see. The same stuff!"</p> <p>"You want to see all of those people? We have to get home, though."</p> <p>"Yeah," he agreed. "We won't be going to a bunch of parties after that. We'll just stop and catch up on what's going on, too! What kind of friends do you have down here?"</p> <p>"I got my classes Tuesday, too!"</p> <p>We had to stop and pick up his mom. I drove out to a friend's house and we talked, and I wanted to be there when I heard the front door open. I waited about ten minutes and then went to meet her. I was sure to see a lot of her. I heard her knock, so I knocked a few seconds later. She opened the door then came in. I heard her speak again. When I was ready to tell her I had to see if I wanted to go to school the next day, she stopped me.</p> <p>"It'll be okay!" she said.</p> <p>"What??"</p> <p>"I'm so sorry I called you a bastard, Mike. You don't know what you're missing!"</p> <p>"It's okay. I guess it's okay for some people to see my friend. The only thing is," I hesitated to tell her about my classes, "I don't have a date this weekend."</p> <p>"Then stop being such a dick!" she laughed. I wanted to go with her to see if she would go back to my friend's house and spend the night. I still didn't know what she looked like, but that didn't matter any one could pick up on.</p> <p>"Okay," I smiled as I left her house. "See you tomorrow."</p> <p>I drove around the city for a couple more days but I couldn't get her to come with me. I figured we would see each other that afternoon. Then I just couldn't find her. Then I got frustrated that she didn't answer my text one-handed. I had to take out some bills to pay for the tickets the other day. It was getting late in the day when I stopped in my area. When I asked her where she lived, she was at a friend's house. The friend wasn't her husband. I figured they'd be there.</p> <p>When I got to her house, I made sure I knocked the door several times. The door finally opened and I saw her sitting on her porch. It took me a few moments to get my bearings. Finally I came to her face.</p> <p>"Hi," I said sheepishly.</p> <p>She had a quizzical look on her face. "You're so nervous," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah. I just had some bad news. They have no school, so I'm stuck there until late tonight."</p> <p>"I'm so sorry, honey. I wish you weren't a little stuck!"</p> <p>"No, no, honey. You have everything right here!" We hugged a little closer and then she had her arms around my waist and was kissing me with the warmest, softest kiss Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
