I whispered as my body began to shiver and moan. My pussy juices were flowing down onto her legs and thighs. My body went stiff. I was breathing hard.</p> <p>'Oh God." I gasped "please don't." My body begged.</p> <p>"Of course I won't honey." I said as I reached down and gripped her legs and slid them over his shoulders, opening us wider.</p> <p>'Oh God." I gasped as my head went back, my eyes closed tight and my arms wrapped around him pulling him deeper inside me.</p> <p>"Oh God honey." I whispered as I tried to thrust up with my body.</p> <p>"Oh yeah baby." He said as I felt his fingers pull at my nipples as though begging me too.</p> <p>My pussy began to tremble and quiver, my whole body tensed, my clit was throbbing and my pussy felt warm as it throbbed against his cock.</p> <p>"Oh Yes baby." I begged as I felt his hands caress my breasts as the first wave of orgasm washed over my body.</p> <p>"Oh baby." He whispered as he cupped and squeezed my breasts.</p> <p>"Oh no." I gasped as the waves of pleasure crashed down and over me.</p> <p>"Oh God." I moaned as the intensity of my release continued. My body shook and shook. The intensity was too much to take. The feelings were so intense. The orgasms were intense. Both of us were trembling and trembling against it. It was intense and beautiful.</p> <p>"Oh my love." I softly caressed his face.</p> <p>"Honey." He whispered "don't move."</p> <p>"No I can't." I said as my body began to relax. I pulled him on top of me, our bodies pressed against each other. I felt his hot breath on my neck as he kissed and licked all around my tender breast.</p> <p>"Don't move." I whispered as I lifted my arms above my head and held him tightly as he kissed his way down my throat to my breasts, where he began to suck and play.</p> <p>"Oh God....." I hissed as my body jumped.</p> <p>"Don't move." I urged as his head moved over my stomach, my pussy fluttered as he kissed it until he finally stopped. My body relaxed as though it was on the edge of an abyss. The feelings he had invoked were becoming pleasurable! He placed one of his hands on my pussy and then brought it down between us to his cock. I felt the head move with his hand, feeling he cock enter me.</p> <p>"My cock honey." I breathed as I lifted my hips toward his cock. The feel of his throbbing organ inside me was so incredible. I had never had anything in me that was so deep, so sensitive. I never felt a real cock in me. I had never felt anything inside me that was so different at this moment. It felt like I was a whole different person. But I could not move. He continued to move his body in and out of my body. We made love. We made love, we made love.</p> <p>"Oh my god." I whispered as I came again. We held each other as I experienced one of the strongest orgasms that I have ever had. My body began to tremble as it began to go limp. Slowly he removed the length of his rod from my pussy and then he lay down on my chest. My arms and legs were trembling and my whole body was weak. I held him as we lie in each other's embrace.</p> <p>"Honey." I softly spoke as my heart thumped a mile a minute.</p> <p>'Did you do that?' He looked at me.</p> <p>"Yes. I did." I gasped as we lay there.</p> <p>"My baby fell asleep." He said as his arms tightened around me.</p> <p>"I don't think so. My body is weak. You can never catch me." I whispered as I held him.</p> <p>"Honey. You can feel how strong my body is." He whispered as he moved against me.</p> <p>'It's happening baby.' I whispered.</p> <p>'We won't get out of here. We'll get home.' I pleaded as I held him tighter.</p> <p>'What's stopping us?' I whispered as I continued to hold him.</p> <p>'If you can't catch me there is no going back now.' I whispered.</p> <p>'Then you have to stay like this the rest of the day.' I said.</p> <p>"Don't I have to go?" He whispered as he moved his head down to lightly kiss me.</p> <p>'Oh yes.' I groaned as my pussy began to tingle again.</p> <p>"But baby this may come between us in the morning. You are my baby now." He whispered as he looked meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
