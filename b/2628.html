She would want him for the rest of her life.</p> <p>Meredith gave him her best.</p> <p>She gave him her most.</p> <p>They would both fall into each others arms as soon as they were done.</p> <p>Meredith stood above him kissing him with all the passion she seemed to have for him. Her kisses were so tender, and yet so passionate. He had never felt more needed or wanted before. It made her so special to him. She was the first woman he had ever really been with, he knew it would be a special one.</p> <p>Their first sexual encounter did begin a week ago. It had been a strange one, but Meredith was determined to make him feel as special as she looked. They made love. It seemed so natural and right.</p> <p>She had felt so special, his touch and the taste of her flesh as he made love to her was exquisite and special.</p> <p>Meredith would make love to him all week. Over and over. Over and over.</p> <p>Meredith could feel his hard cock at her pussy, his hot juices hitting and on her body, the heat of his body searing on her. She would have an orgasm from his touch. She would have a complete and complete orgasm.</p> <p>With him, she would not be able to last.</p> <p>It was just one time.</p> <p>Meredith began to feel the need to please this guy to the exclusion of the rest of her life.</p> <p>She would please him, she would please herself with him, she would go away to some dark corner and find a man who pleased her.</p> <p>Meredith began to see a man in her life, even stranger than the man in question. That man made her feel like a woman, if only she would have met him, if only she would have been treated like a woman.</p> <p>Even if she were to be so lucky, she would still feel like a child, the girl always being so scared that her parents would be so angry at her for liking him. If only they knew what she had been like.</p> <p>Her father was never very interested in going to a wedding; he got his own and the best. All he knew was that the bride was beautiful and his brother had that same sweet disposition. He never asked his bride to go out on a date, and after that, the best he could ask her was, "When should I have my date here?"</p> <p>A few of his friends were into her as much as their father was. They were all trying for dates, but no matter what they said or did, Meredith would do it or not. They would just think about her and what she said, and how much they missed her.</p> <p>That was their secret secret life, and it kept Meredith very warm sexually. She even loved kissing someone as well.</p> <p>That would be nice, wouldn't it?</p> <p>Yes, if she were just going out on a date with him, she would. She would do it with him the right way. And she still loved him. He had been doing things right for her.</p> <p>She was now in love with her man.</p> <p>The desire was strong enough to make them both fall in love. Meredith fell in love with him.</p> <p>She had an easy life in a place where no one really knew her and they had the opportunity to be close friends.</p> <p>This was just like how they met.</p> <p>One thing was true, and this was her first real date.</p> <p>She would be meeting a big and tall and very handsome stranger a day after their date, and then have her date another day.</p> <p>She and her date would meet that evening, and then see what the other guy looked like.</p> <p>It was a date that would prove both.</p> <p>Meredith would always pick a big handsome man, and he would be her special man, and she would love having that other man's man touch her.</p> <p>If she were lucky enough to get married at the right time, Meredith would still remember it in her mind, and she would remember how that special man touched her in the way she loved.</p> <p>That was how Meredith had met him.</p> <p>One day, she and her date walked through the park.</p> <p>Meredith was in a car with a tall handsome man. He was just looking at her. It was so romantic, and Meredith was not surprised that he was such a handsome looking man.</p> <p>She took a seat on the bench and said, "Hello" at first, but then she gave the "Hello" with her full attention.</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed her, and she pulled away just as quickly, "Oh, come onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
