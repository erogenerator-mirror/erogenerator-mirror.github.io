I was naked, the sweat was running under my balls and thighs. The room was filled with my arousal. I pulled on my pants and left the room.</p> <p>I heard some giggling on the stairway and realized it had come from behind me. I made my way silently, and stopped to look at my back for a moment. I could see the back of the mirror, and as it creaked it did show that I was completely unclothed.</p> <p>My back was as bald as my head, and I could feel the hairs at the base of my ass standing straight out from my shoulders. My chest had long brown hair that grew down below my belly button. My face was the color of the old western, and my chest had brown freckles on it and on top of it there was the most beautiful brown skin I had ever seen.</p> <p>After a moment of silence, a hand reached out and ran over my chest, and I felt like I had to have him inside me. I didn't know if I had made a sound as he massaged me, but something snapped inside of me and my entire body went rigid. I tried to pull away and I could feel myself getting wetter and wetter to.</p> <p>A sharp pain came and I was instantly aware of his hand rubbing against the inside of my thigh. A light touch, at first.</p> <p>I didn't care.</p> <p>My body wanted his hands, and he was rubbing against my heat and my wetness was pouring out inside him for his pleasure and it was all he could do not to just slide his fingers in and out and feel me. The need had built up inside of me again and my muscles tensed and clenched, begging for his touch to send out my pleasure deep and strong. I leaned closer, taking his hand and putting it against my mound. I felt him pull slightly away as another soft moan escaped my lips and my whole body shook as his touch drove me crazy and he pressed against my flesh.</p> <p>He slid his body in all the way, and it felt as warm and soft as the rest of me. It was as if he was in complete control of his body and his pleasure, and this made me feel wonderful.</p> <p>I leaned in and kissed his lips, and he returned it with urgency and desire. He wanted me, and I was there, and he pushed the rest of his body in toward mine, so that he was completely inside me. I thought it felt like he would never go any farther, but his body started to move and his hands were rubbing, pulling, squeezing.</p> <p>I don't even know if I moaned because he was inside of me and didn't want to, or if I was afraid if he would just thrust and pull out, but my body wanted him deep inside of me, and my whole soul wanted him to thrust into me. I wanted every inch of him, the whole length of him, into the deepest place. I didn't know how I managed to even talk when he did something that I thought would kill me. As it was, I started to kiss him just as his fingers found their way between my legs and started going in and out of me.</p> <p>I couldn't find words, the pleasure was overwhelming, and a little moan escaped my lips. It was at that moment I realized that he was really fucking me with his fingers, not fucking me. I was in pain, and he was just sliding them in and out while rubbing against my sensitive spot inside my vagina.</p> <p>I could feel his hips as he moved his body closer to mine but he kept pressing against me as my entire body was being pulled and pulled in the direction of pleasure. His fingers kept going in and out while he rubbed against my sex, teasing, arousing me. Every motion seemed to send a wave of pleasure that I didn't want to end. Every little sensation became an electric shock, and my body moved in all kinds of directions.</p> <p>When he finally pushed into it, I felt as if he were splitting me in half. He slid all the way into me, and held himself inside me until I finally understood that he was actually moving in and out of me. If I hadn't been so hot for him that he was already making me feel so incredible, I wouldn't have been able to talk. My body told me I was in heaven, and I wasn't going to fight him and say anything. Whatever he wanted to do would happen, and there would be no holding back.</p> <p>He continued to move in and out of me, his fingers constantly teasing inside of me. My whole body didn't feel like it was in pain anymore, in pleasure, in pain. It felt wonderful. As he continued to move in and out of me, he kept kissing my neck with his mouth. I could feel his tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
