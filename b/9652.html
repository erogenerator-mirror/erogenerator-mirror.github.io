This is so fucked." He chuckled.</p> <p>We kissed, and he went into the next room to get fresh towels, and as he was back with a wet towel he told me to undress. It looked like it would be a chore, but I was to put the towel down, and then he had to tie it up behind my back to keep me from falling. He took the towels and tied me up like that. I lay there, still half naked, and he left the room, coming back to use the shower to wash himself.</p> <p>"Where are your panties?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, my shorts. They're in the other bag, but I brought you those before I left. I had to wash them in my car, but they were too much to get out. I have plenty of soft cotton in my drawer now."</p> <p>"I'll wear your panties in case I'm ever in the mood to do something like that." I laughed as he left the room.</p> <p>He returned a bit later, and I was standing in the middle of the room, with my shorts on, but nothing else. He picked them up and started playing with them. I couldn't help but notice that a couple of his fingers went into my pussy while his hand was wrapped around my leg at the same time. He slipped his fingers in a little further, and slowly started working them around inside me. It was a great fuck, but I knew it was only going to get better.</p> <p>"You okay, baby?" He asked. I asked him not to do it. He wasn't lying, I was just really looking forward to it.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. Just keep playing with my pussy while you fuck me." He said it so matter-of-factly, I couldn't help but laugh.</p> <p>I was on the verge of orgasm at the moment, and he moved my skirt up a little bit. If he kept going, I was almost there.</p> <p>"Get up on the bench, baby." I heard, and he got off the floor and stood right next to me. I had him in my grip as he stood, still pulling on my shorts, and he started to put his tongue down inside me. I was already on the brink of an orgasm when he pulled one, the other was just out of my hair and in my mouth by the end. I lost track of how many times I came, and could only guess there was more coming. I was still sucking on him, when he pulled my shorts up, his other hand still busy inside me, and then he dropped down between my legs and I was instantly aware of his tongue in my mouth. I felt hands caressing my butt, then down my legs, and again. Someone else's hands cupped my breasts, and I felt some weight on me. It felt like it was someone's hand on my pussy, so I was sure it was the same person that was doing this. It felt like someone else was fucking me, but I was more aware of the body next to me than my husband. I couldn't say how much time I had before his hand moved from my breasts to my pussy. I didn't really have time to think as he used his thumb to rub me, then began circling. This guy had some control over me, and that control didn't prevent him from making me cum like crazy and begging me not to stop him.</p> <p>He kept teasing me, and then he was using his fingers to work my button, as if he could read my mind. I think he liked that. I thought he was playing with my clit as if he could read my body, as it would drive me wild. I could feel myself starting to relax and enjoy the sensations. He kept rubbing, the sensations were just perfect. I was going crazy, and I didn't want it to end, the thought was in my head, but I couldn't say what it felt like. After a while, I couldn't concentrate on the stimulation in front of me anymore, and I just wanted him inside my pussy.</p> <p>When I let go of his cock, I thought I felt something wet and hot inside me. It was the mouth on my clit, sucking on it and the tongue inside my pussy. I was getting into it when a second tongue went in my pussy. It was a guy, and it felt great. I was surprised at such intense sensations inside of me. It didn't take me long to start to feel like I was going to cum, when I could only feel my own orgasm starting. I was on the very edge when my orgasm hit.</p> <p>He didn't move, but instead leaned back and pulled me up by both my shoulders until I was completely straddled over his cock. This time felt better, not as great as the previous couple. I could feel the head of his cock, but I think he didnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
