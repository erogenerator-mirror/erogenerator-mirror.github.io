And I did to.</p> <p>With the tip of my dick resting on the crack of her ass, I ran my fingers between her legs and let out a small moan of relief.</p> <p>She purred back in agreement and I got a huge smile on my face.</p> <p>"Your wife's hot!" she told me. "I think we made a very sexy couple!"</p> <p>I smiled back at her and said, "Damn right she's a sexy piece of ass. Let's go take a shower."</p> <p>We pulled up into the parking lot of the spa and we all jumped in, stripping quickly from head to toe. I slipped my arms around her waist and pulled her close to me as I wrapped my arms around her, kissing her on the mouth and feeling her breasts through her bra. We were both so horny our bodies were shaking and her hand dropped down to rub across my crotch.</p> <p>"Oh yeah! That feels good," she moaned between kisses. A moment later she broke off the wet kiss.</p> <p>"I want to take off your blouse," she said. "While we shower. I was thinking we could go skinny-dipping with you," and she reached behind me and unfastened my bra.</p> <p>I didn't have long to think about what that was as she started pulling the wet bra off, revealing my tits.</p> <p>"Oh shit! Yeah!" I moaned when she grabbed my nipples in her fingernails and began pulling on them. For the next few minutes we went along like this until she said she wanted to take the rest of our clothes off. I slid down her body and undid her skirt and slid it down, leaving her panty clad crotch exposed. I slid off her panties and slid them to the floor and had to admit she was very tasty. Her pussy was bald and so smooth; the lips were soft and wet from being wet with wetness.</p> <p>She slid herself up on the shower stall and began kissing me while I got wet myself. She had me bent over on my back, my head hanging down and her tongue diving into my mouth. I could see my juices glimmering on her face as she tasted her own juices. While she was kissing me, her fingers teased my nipples and I felt her hand slide down my stomach and caress my clit. She continued teasing my clit as my body got wetter and wetter. She pulled her head away and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"I love you, Rick!" she said. "I love you, honey. Oh fuck I love you."</p> <p>Her eyes were filled with love and she smiled back at me, "I love you too, lover!"</p> <p>"I'd really like to try a few things with you," I said as I slid off the shower stall and into the tub. We both giggled when I bent to kiss her and she stepped under the shower. When I was about half submerged she looked up into my eyes and said, "Go get your bag."</p> <p>I quickly picked up my bag and grabbed the bottle of shampoo and the towels and headed down the hall to get a pair of towels for the bedroom. When Rachel stepped out of the bathroom, I immediately grabbed her hips and pulled her to me. We kissed and explored each other's bodies, enjoying the way each time our tongues and lips touched.</p> <p>When we finally broke, she pulled back and said, "Wow! That was pretty intense."</p> <p>"It was, wasn't it?' I laughed. How could I not love such a great woman?</p> <p>After rinsing off herself, she went into the bedroom and dressed and I picked up the other towels. After toweling each other dry with our new wet towels, I came back to the living room. When Rachel came back she was wearing a bathrobe and just like me was naked. She handed me our water.</p> <p>"I'm getting cold," she said. "Could I get you a towel?"</p> <p>"Sure, what do you have in mind?"</p> <p>"I've got a surprise for you, but I'm sure it can wait," she laughed and then went out of the room to go get one of her robes.</p> <p>I sat on the sofa feeling extremely weird about what I'd just gotten. I hadn't gotten naked with a woman in years, let alone a woman that cared so much about fucking me. I got up and checked the clock. It was six thirty at home. I knew Rachel still had about an hour to go.</p> <p>"Wow!" I said.
