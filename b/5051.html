Her lips reached their end and the tip of my cock nudged the lips of her vagina. She moaned as I slid into her. Her whole body shuddered beneath me as my penis penetrated her. Slowly I drew it back until only the head remained in the warm depths of her canal. This time when I withdrew, I made sure the tip of my wet cock rested against her clitoris.</p> <p>"You have no idea how long I've wanted you," she whispered, as her hands pulled me to her breasts and her nipples hardened by my stimulation. I thrust myself fully into her, and began a slow rocking motion that took her hand away from her clitoris. She moaned and I saw my cum shoot in to the ceiling. As I came, I could feel my semen dribble out of her vagina. I was exhausted and she felt the same way.</p> <p>We kissed, and then fell asleep in each other's arms. We were both too sleep worn out to remember the first day.</p> <p>When morning came I took her hand and held it gently.</p> <p>"I have something I want to tell you," she said quietly and turned her face away.

"What would I do?" I asked.</p> <p>"Do I get to feel all of you? What would it feel like?" we both said in unison.</p> <p>"It'd be a sin to keep you around this long," I said.</p> <p>"I love your face and your heart. That's one of the things I loved about you. I can't wait to see what you have in mind. Are you sure you would like to give up all these things that would have been available to you years ago?" I thought about it for a moment.
