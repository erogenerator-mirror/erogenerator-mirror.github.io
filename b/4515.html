I just looked at her without speaking; she smiled.</p> <p>I said in reply, "Yeah...no, no, no, I can't." We broke eye contact and she laughed at me. We kept laughing. Then I looked at her and told her that I didn't love her anymore.</p> <p>That made her laugh again and we started looking at each other again. I told her I was tired and told her I had to go. She got up and said she would call me later.</p> <p>We talked on her way home. She told me about what happened, about how it made her feel, but then I reminded her that I had always been faithful.</p> <p>She said she knew I was going to make a decision but she didn't have to make any decisions. She said it was because she loved me and she knew I would understand if it made her change her mind. We parted company and I took another trip to see my cousin for the next two months. I still had a great time with my cousin.</p> <p>After the last time together I came to the decision that I was going to do it all over again. So I told her that if she was looking for more than a relationship I would be willing to try it again.</p> <p>She said, "That's good because even if you're not with me again, then this time I will make the next decision." I said I wanted that to happen again and that if she was ready to get serious about me, to have second thoughts that I could still give her a call.</p> <p>She asked me if I was serious and I said I was. I asked her if I could call her if I were still seeing someone and she said that's just about the time I would have the chance to.</p> <p>It was the next morning and I called her every second she would be awake. The next time we were together it was around the time I was getting ready to go to work.</p> <p>I asked when she would be available for another relationship and she said next Tuesday if possible. I told her I would stop by and see her that week of time the week would be up. I also told her that if she was ready I would go for it again.</p> <p>She said she was as well and I told her I would. There were plenty of other people at the hotel we went to that day.</p> <p>I went on to visit my parents while they were in the hotel. I was just coming out from inside when she walked in the door. She saw the surprised look on my face and asked when would be available. I said Tuesday, the weekend after she went back to her school, I would like to take her on a first date.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "That's really nice. So you're really serious about me then."</p> <p>I looked at her and then said, "Well, it's just you'll see what I mean, but I'm so serious about us and I don't want to lose you in that, that sort of thing."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I'm flattered that you'd think that." I could tell she was joking about how serious I was about not doing anything else with her and I said, "No, no, I still have a lot of things to do. You know that."</p> <p>I said as we walked away that I would call her and see her on Tuesday. I told her that I wanted her to make the first move.</p> <p>I also told her I would see her at my parent's house the week before her leaving school.</p> <p>I would also tell her that when I got home from work I had a number of things to finish.</p> <p>Then she said she wanted to call me for lunch the next morning.</p> <p>I said that would be nice.</p> <p>Then I gave her that number and told her to look for it on our way homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
