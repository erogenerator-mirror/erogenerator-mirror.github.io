Even as I moved my eyes to meet hers.</p> <p>"Do you love me, Dari?" She murmured. "Do you love me? Does love mean anything to you? I have been feeling this way for a while, and I thought I was in heaven...</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Does love mean anything, if being loved means being in love?" I prompted.</p> <p>She glanced at me, then moved away, her back to me. "I have loved you for a long time, and I want to make you happy. But I want you to know that I love you, and I want the same as you, Dari.</p> <p>"I love you, and I want to make you happy. I need to do this for you."</p> <p>I watched her walk to the small table, and she picked up a small bottle and some candles, then sat down and lit each one, then bent to kiss Dari again, this time at her doorstep. I had long ago found this very erotic. She turned to me, and I held my hand. Her eyes were open, and glistening now, as she reached to kiss mine.</p> <p>"Come inside..." she said, standing up, and opening a door. Then she pushed me inside a dark chamber, and I heard the sounds of music as she closed and locked the door. She returned to the couch and dropped to the edge, raising her legs to pull her dress up above her knees. She lay on her back, and I stood there beside her. She reached for my dick, and I had the sudden impulse to turn away, but I knew that the heat between us would intensify. She looked up as I looked at her, her eyes twinkling, and she said, "Make love with me..."</p> <p>I did not, however. I wanted to be ready to be claimed, and she had been ready. And I could not deny her the pleasure she had given me. I knelt beside her, caressing her belly with my fingers, tracing the little scar that had formed when she had touched me down there that morning. I leaned over, my lips kissing her nipple, then gently biting it as I kissed my way to her breasts, leaving a trail of saliva down towards her navel. I could feel her quivering with need at this gentle touch. She began gently to moan when I drew a finger into my mouth, and I slowly followed up with another, bringing a shudder up through her body. Her breathing became harsh in her ear, and she held my head against her.</p> <p>"Dari..."</p> <p>"Shh..."</p> <p>"Lay down on the floor by the pool, Dari..." I said. She did what I asked, and I drew her close to me, my body pressing against hers as I kissed her neck, the tip of my dick pressing between her legs. She reached for me, guiding my dick into her, and we kissed again.</p> <p>"Do you love me?" I asked, again, just to be careful.</p> <p>"I hope you know it."</p> <p>"I love you, Dari... I promise I'll never tell..."</p> <p>"Promise me..." I murmured. She pulled me down and I reached for her, my fingers drawing hers to my face. We kissed as we moved together, our lips kissing each other passionately.</p> <p>I moved back and stood beside her, my mouth to hers. Her eyes opened, and she gasped as our lips met. I broke our kiss, letting her come up for air, then held her at the waist as I moved to stand over her. I could see her eyes, and her hands on my cock, looking down at me and nodding as I moved towards her. Slowly I moved in, until her lips touched mine, and she broke away.</p> <p>"Make love to me, Dari. And make me very happy."</p> <p>I pulled my cock out and she moved over it, until I was in her up to the hilt. She lay back, and I wrapped my hands around her, and I could feel her quivering against my hands as I thrust in and out of her.</p> <p>"Oh God, Dari..." she cried.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around me and pulled me fully in, causing my body to jerk and jerk in response. She wrapped her arms and legs around me like a vise, and I could feel the pleasure she was giving me. Our lips moved together. I moved one hand to her breast and took a nipple in my mouth. She kissed me back, then moved to kiss me, her tongue finding mine. I felt her hips jerk against me, then suddenly, her climax overtook her. She pushed her mouth into mine, moaning into my mouth.</p> <p>We were moaning, holding each other with a passion that could not be matchedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
