Do you know what the best part is?"</p> <p>"Nope but I know what the best part is. I don't want to lose my marriage, just the least I could do is go back to work and pretend that nothing happened for a while."</p> <p>"OK then. But I don't want any distractions from your career. I want to go to your home." I kissed her nose and kissed her other nose.</p> <p>"Thank you, honey. You're a smart, handsome, educated woman. You deserve a little fun. We can go out to dinner, we could watch a movie or just stay here together."</p> <p>"I would like that but first my husband has to work and leave for work.

I kissed her full lips and then turned to kiss her on her chin and neck.</p> <p>"I think we are going to have a great evening; I'm hungry againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
