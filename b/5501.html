I checked into my room, took off her dress, and went to make dinner. She had come in an hour or so later and was wearing a robe. She was also stunning. She was wearing a red, lace covered, black, garter belt, and three inch open toed black silk, open toe, high heeled shoe and dark tan hose. She looked great.</p> <p>"Do the dishes," I said.</p> <p>She did the dishes; and she looked so sexy and sexy. It didn't change the way I felt. I turned to leave.</p> <p>"Wait," she said.</p> <p>"Do I have to?" I asked.</p> <p>"Do you have to, and if..." she started.</p> <p>"No, just do what you need to do, and do what you need to do."</p> <p>"Okay, let's go to the bedroom," she said.</p> <p>We went to the bedroom. It was a nice room. The bed was king size. There were pillows surrounding the center and the head of the bed was pushed way back. A light was on to the master bath. I started removing her shoes as she slid her robe off. It was a long, sexy, sexy strip. I stripped to my boxers, and she pulled out her panties. Those were a little wrinkled and a little smelly, I put a finger in her vagina. She was very wet. I had to take the rest of my clothes off, and then I removed her bra. She had a good sized C cup, and her breasts were beautiful and firm . Her areolas were a dark, olive, almost purple. The nipples were very pale and erect. She had nice breasts, and for a woman in her late 60's, a mature woman, she could be quite beautiful. I took her panties off. They both fell to the floor in a wet patch.</p> <p>She stepped out of her panties. They were damp, of course. Her pussy was neatly trimmed, and a neat landing patch of her pubic hair showed above that. I had never seen a woman's pussy; I had to have it. I climbed on the high bed, and with an ease that almost seemed effortless, I pushed my penis into her. I kissed her and held her breasts. I could tell she was enjoying this. She was really getting into the sex. She had a big smile on her face, and she moved her hips against me. I was really getting in rhythm with her. I felt an orgasm coming and it felt great.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, that's good, baby."</p> <p>"That's enough, baby," I said.</p> <p>"Not quite yet," she said.</p> <p>"You're ready now."</p> <p>"Let me go, you can go."</p> <p>"But," I said and backed off, "I have to take my shower first."</p> <p>She said, "I thought you wanted to take mine."</p> <p>"I was just wondering," I said, "Do I know you, or is this my first time?"</p> <p>She looked at me and I'm sure she saw that something in the grin I gave her, that maybe she recognized me from the stories that had my dick in her mouth. Her eyes were moist.</p> <p>"Yes, if you were my first time, then I'm afraid that you will be my first."</p> <p>"It sounds good."</p> <p>"It sounds right," I said, "I want to be your first. Then I'm going to do my shower and go to sleep."</p> <p>"And...?"</p> <p>The "and" was not necessary. I rolled her quickly off me. "I have to go." She was very breathless and flushed. Still, I wanted to give her the sex she wanted, but I had just fucked my girlfriend and knew she had to go. If I wasn't going to be able to make her, she may want to come back.</p> <p>I made a trip, and got the shower started. I opened the glass shower door, and she got in. The water was nice and warm. She did look hot; her hair was all tumbled around her shoulders, and her body looked very feminine and beautiful. She looked at me, put her arms around my neck and moved in for a kiss. I did not put my arms around her, but she kissed me back, and her hands went to my dick. I was hard, and she was wet. Our kissing continued. She was still looking at me, but she was breathing lightly. I slid my hands down her back, and she moved them away and held my dick with both hands.</p> <p>"Oh, this is very nice," she said.</p> <p>She got up onto her knees and looked at my dick.
