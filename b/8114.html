This is a first time for both of us, and I am very sorry I made you feel vulnerable, knowing that only you will be allowed to be alone with us." He kissed me again.</p> <p>"Do you know what I did with my first sexual experience?" he asked.</p> <p>"Only what might be considered an adventure of a lifetime," I grinned.</p> <p>"You're right, it was something special," he said, smiling, "you were in for an amazing time."</p> <p>"I'm certain that I am," I replied. "I don't want that to happen again if you're not comfortable with it." I blushed. "Is that OK with you?"</p> <p>"It's alright, baby," he hugged me, "If I'd known I'd be here with you I'd have put it down to 'what is possible.' It just takes something to do, doesn't it?"</p> <p>"It doesn't," I agreed.</p> <p>I was amazed that he seemed calm, and just seemed to take it all in calmly. That was something he always did, so I'm sure I looked at his face with the question in it to see just how he had expected it. I tried to find out if I could trust him, which I doubted because this was really the first time I had even done it in front of someone he cared for, but he was like anyone else I had ever met.</p> <p>"It's OK, sweetheart; really if you change your mind, please call me."</p> <p>"Will you try it again after we get home, maybe you can make up for this time?"</p> <p>"Oh, please," I pleaded, "please, I'd do anything to make it up to you."</p> <p>He didn't say much more, it was the middle of the night, and I was already late for class. I was sure that he was still not ready to get up in the middle of the night, but I was getting really excited, so I tried to think of a way to ask what he would ask about me being late. He said he was happy about that because he had really wanted to get back into action with me, and so he was waiting for me after class. As I drove down the street, I knew that this was going to be all a long forgotten event.</p> <p>I arrived home around 7:00 and was surprised to see that my parents were not home. The thought of going upstairs to find him had occurred to me, as I wanted to surprise him as soon as I had been home. But no sooner had I pulled into my garage than he arrived with the dinner I had been planning on for the day. He was wearing one of his best gowns, and I'm sure, he noticed that since he was only wearing the jeans, which had ridden up his strong legs, that I wasn't the only one with him. After dinner, we sat down to dinner, and as soon as I tasted my first real meal, I could not have been more happy. My parents were away until the night before, and we really talked about everything. We ended up just sitting there together eating dinner and talking about school and football, and I was glad that I had found the one man that I wanted to be with and that I felt I could trust once he was a little more relaxed. I knew that I should have done everything to bring him to this point; it was way too late not to at least try. For me, there really was nothing that I had to do at all. But, I did promise him that when we were together, I would make him feel very special and that I would do everything I could to make it with him.</p> <p>"Thank you for letting us eat, Eric," my mother said from the living room, "I'm going to need something to clean myself, but we don't mind."</p> <p>"You're welcome, Mommy," he smiled at her, "I'll clean up after you and we'll have some wine."</p> <p>The rest of the evening, I didn't ask for much of anything that I was to do, and I was a bit relieved when we had finally finished. I was glad that we did it out of love.</p> <p>At work a few hours later, I called on him to come get me. I was hoping that I could somehow hold up the amount of times that I had been without talking, and that I would make it up to him before the weekend was over. I did notice that he had not said much, and I wasn't sure how he would react if he knew that I had been out late that night.</p> <p>When he arrived at my computer room, I was just getting it up when he said just one more thing that he asked of me in his absence, "So, will you go out with me tonight, sweetheart?"</p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
