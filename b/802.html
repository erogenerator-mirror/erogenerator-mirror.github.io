If you want to go with that, you can wear it, for your own amusement," I said. "I have a small closet."</p> <p>"I like going to the 'goodie-goodies,'" she said.</p> <p>I was trying not to laugh.</p> <p>"Come on, Mom. You've given me my first goodie-goodie. We're going to get you yours. Come on."</p> <p>"I don't have a choice, I'm afraid. I know it'll be fun at least," she said. "But if I wear it, you'll probably get the bigger baggie."</p> <p>I laughed and put on my own bag.</p> <p>She made sure to hold the baggie, and I felt its weight.</p> <p>"What's the real big one?" she said, not sounding offended.</p> <p>I shook my head.</p> <p>She smiled at her own success. "If you want," she said. "If you like it... I'm just letting you have a goodie-goodie."</p> <p>"You're right, Mom," I said.</p> <p>"If you want them," she said. "Just take them and toss them away later."</p> <p>"Mom," I said.</p> <p>"What?" she said, but a second later, she said, "There you are. You don't have to take them anymore. I'm sure you could handle the baggie if it weren't for me, too."</p> <p>I laughed and kissed her shoulder. The warmth of the affection seemed to give her goose bumps and that made me feel good. "Hey, Mom," I said, "don't worry about the baggie, you'll love it."</p> <p>"If I do," she said, "I'll love it—for myself—or you."</p> <p>I leaned back and looked at my mother. She had an expectant look in her eyes, like a kid looking at a Christmas gift. "How does it feel? It's so warm," I said.</p> <p>After a moment of staring at me, while she tried to imagine how she would feel when we got home, she said, "It feels warm. It felt warm when we first got here—maybe a little too warm—because I didn't wear any panties. I felt the little lump that you put in my boxers." She laughed as she said it, and the expression on her face said, 'You did too. Oh gawd, did I tell you that already?'</p> <p>"Did you do that?" I said, grinning.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah! I did! There, now I know what that's all about."</p> <p>I laughed at that expression of contentment and happiness on her face. My whole body felt alive, warm and cozy and relaxed. Not that I wasn't glad that she wanted us to be together, or because I was glad that I was still in control of myself. It was just that her words seemed to have come from somewhere deep inside her. She had asked if I wanted us to be with each other again. Was she telling me that she wanted to be with me again, too?</p> <p>It was so good to see my mother again. She had never looked so gorgeous and so desirable. She was the epitome of the feminine ideal—a womanly woman—an exquisite, sexy mother who lived her life in the right order. Her hair was long and full and she was always pretty, but her face was soft and loving and the expression in her eyes was so sincere it made me feel silly. She was beautiful and I felt I could love her back.</p> <p>"It feel warm," she said. "And warm. Do you want me to show you how it feels?"</p> <p>I didn't know how warm and cozy it would be, but I felt that her closeness made the air cold to her bare skin. It would be nice if I could walk up and pull my shorts down and we could have a romantic day all day long.</p> <p>"Okay, Mom," I said. "I love you."</p> <p>She looked so happy and relaxed that I could easily imagine her sitting there beside me in her bedroom holding her hand a little more lovingly. "I can't tell what you did with your baggie—it had to be somewhere."</p> <p>I was feeling warm and snug, but my shorts—I'm not an exhibitionist—were still stuck to my erection. "It felt warm, no?" I asked, trying to make sense of what she just said. "But it felt warm.
