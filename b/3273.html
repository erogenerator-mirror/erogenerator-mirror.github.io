It was a little more forceful.</p> <p>"Yes, I meant it, and I love you for it. Yes, you said you loved me for it. You're the only one."</p> <p>The second kiss was a little more aggressive and I could see the desire in her eyes. The kiss really didn't change my attraction for her and she seemed to accept that. She had not told me she wanted to do it, only that I could.</p> <p>Her hands slowly moved away, but her kiss only ended when our lips and tongues were once again locked.</p> <p>"God that was nice." I groaned as I broke away from her to see if she was OK when she was in my arms. She was standing in the middle of the room, smiling.</p> <p>She looked so incredible, and her hair pulled back in a French braid. She was wearing a long, loose fitting red robe. She looked fantastic! Her eyes were dark, but not at all smoky. I noticed the color of her hair as she stared at me. I looked away, not wanting to look at her in that way.</p> <p>"Is everything OK?" I asked, "If you don't mind me saying, is it OK to just stay here with me for a few minutes, you know that?"</p> <p>"Do I? Well I'm not going to sleep anywhere tonight. You'd kill me. You must have a lot on your mind," smiled the first one. "I'm sorry, but I've been really bad."</p> <p>"It's okay," I said "We aren't trying to be anything either. We just want to talk about what happened."</p> <p>"What happened is that we were on a date and that I think you need to get a grip about how much you really love me. I really did need to tell you the truth, don't you? So let me just talk and get over it."</p> <p>She looked up, "I think you're a terrible liar, but please don't start again. You are both terrible at lying."</p> <p>She looked at me briefly and then down at her breasts. "They're a bit small."</p> <p>"Maybe they're bigger than I'm used to."</p> <p>"You can't believe that. You can't imagine how hard it must be for me to know you love me so much. Just tell it, Jack."</p> <p>I couldn't tell a lie, I wanted to but I didn't know how. I knew I had to tell her now. That was the second kiss she had given me. The first one was a little more aggressive, only slightly less forceful.</p> <p>"Don't start again, Mary. I've seen it before, remember? We can talk about what we felt this time when you were upset."</p> <p>She got down on her knees and started undoing the buttons on my shirt. By the time she had gotten to the bottom she had me stripped almost entirely down. As the last button was passed through the fly she reached in and grabbed my dick. She stroked it a couple of times, looking at it, her eyes not showing anything she wasn't already doing. When it began to get hard she grabbed the waistline of the pants and pulled them down. I was standing in front of her with my shirt and pants hanging off of my feet. My dick was hanging down with just a little blood showing.</p> <p>She took my dick in her hand and placed it in her mouth. The first inch or two of my dick was very little and she wasn't giving very much. She had moved my cock around a bit, looking at it in her hand. I was afraid she was going to choke or start to gag so I was having trouble controlling myself. Even with a mouth on my dick there was still a slight amount of blood showing.</p> <p>She finally had three inches in her mouth and was breathing through pursed lips, "It feels so good," and then she pulled back and looked up at me, "It's not going in much."</p> <p>"Mary, I'm not a doctor."</p> <p>"Don't be silly, that's what happens when you try to help a girl." She had moved her hand away from my dick and was looking down at it. Her eyes showed a sadness I couldn't quite imagine. Her hand stroked it very lightly and she seemed to like the way I was feeling.</p> <p>She pulled my dick forward a little bit and smiled at me, "Don't try to hurt me," she said as her eyes grew still and her hand stroked my dick a little harder. "Don't tell me you don't want me to put it in your pussy. I don't want to do something so ugly."</p> <p>"Don't ever say it likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
