She said with a smile, "I'm just glad we're not alone."</p> <p>I nodded, "I'm sure there are more of you here than we thought."</p> <p>"I know, but it's hard to believe this is happening. It took months of our life for me to make it, and we were both too busy before we got to that point. Just the thought of being single again is so daunting. What is it going to be like?"</p> <p>"I'll give you an idea, but I'm not going to lie. The guys here are definitely in the top ten out there, but with a little luck I should have them all in college and out there for a year or so!" I said with a wink and a smile.</p> <p>"Well, that makes a great time to take advantage of the fact that we are going to have some fun. Come on, let's make our way to the party." She said as she stepped her foot across the threshold and opened the door, leading me to the patio.</p> <p>Wet and glistening we walked along the patio and stopped outside the bar that was set up for the evening party. The sun was setting and it was beginning to get dark so we turned it down and started up the stairs. There was music and people dancing, a lot of it was good as long as it was slow and sweet. Most had a drink or two and were having more of those. We sat to a few couples on the couch, mostly with another couple around the side of our area. We were close enough that our legs were touching once, and one of them let out a small gasp as she felt my bare leg.</p> <p>We looked out over the patio and our eyes were immediately drawn to that corner where the bar was set. We stopped to get another margarita, each one taking it in a turn and drinking. Our eyes moved across each other while trying to drink up the drinks. "So do you have any idea what we have planned tonight?" I asked her, "or do I have some idea of what can come up next?"</p> <p>"This doesn't just have to be a group thing, we'll have to go somewhere, and I know we won't get as far as you are expecting." She said as she handed me the margarita. "Well, I have to get back up, I think I need to see if I could make this party a reality. It's going to be really crazy." She said as she took another drink from my glass and said, "And I've gotta get into my car."</p> <p>"Sure." I agreed, "You can get out of here, if you want."</p> <p>"No, I want, you don't want me to leave you guys." I said as I grabbed the towel and headed past her to get my suitcase.</p> <p>"I'm the one who should drive." She replied as I walked toward her. "Can you get the other side of the car, I'll give you a little room."</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>She grabbed her purse and walked toward the door. "I'll keep you company." I said as I held out my hand. "Thanks for having me by the pool tonight."</p> <p>"I was just kidding," She said and smiled at me.</p> <p>"It's OK by me." I replied and took my drink from her hand.</p> <p>I walked her back toward the living room and her new friends. There was a big couch right in the middle of that. She went next to me and we sat down. The music was almost a continuous noise with a few slow songs and a few breakfasts. We had drinks and were both feeling it as our bodies got warm. I was sure the temperature was getting warmer as we continued to chat.</p> <p>We were talking about that song for hours and I finally got to where I could feel her up, and I told her that I wanted to be there when my first time with a girl was, and that my first time with women wasn't without the possibility. I got up and went back to the couch and she followed me. I was on my feet in about ten seconds and I got back up at the end of my glass.</p> <p>"I'm glad I had you last night." I told her with a smile. "I know I'd have been in more trouble if something wouldn't have happened at my place."</p> <p>"Why not? You and your first time are way more fun." I said before I got off the couch and went to her.</p> <p>She reached over and kissed me. "You know I had a dream that I wanted to get together with you the other night with your brother. When I had my period the next morning I had to go to the bathroom before I got cleaned up and before I knew what time I had been gone. I was just about to go whenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
