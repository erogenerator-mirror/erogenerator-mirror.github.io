He asked. "A lot like yours." He added.</p> <p>"Well actually this doesn't happen in real life, but..."</p> <p>"No it doesn't." He looked at his watch. "It doesn't usually take more than ten maybe even thirty minutes...and by then it already has."</p> <p>"I was just asking." She said as she rubbed against him. "We can't let you go all the way with that, not even with me." She leaned down and gave him a kiss, and she quickly pulled up and away.</p> <p>"Well how about you get out of here?" He asked with a laugh.</p> <p>She laughed back, "Maybe you could be there, and finish your shift."</p> <p>"That was nice of you...but if you keep talking like that I'm gonna have to stop talking." He said as he stood up. "I need to get some work out of the way before I get back to the store."</p> <p>"Okay!" She said as she got out of his reach. "I'll just put the key in the ignition." She said as she climbed into the middle. "I'll be right out."</p> <p>"So how is your day with the shop going?" He said in a worried tone of voice.</p> <p>"Fine. Really, I'm happy to be here with you again." She replied as she pulled up to his stop in front of a huge multi-story house on the edge of town. "I'm really impressed with it." She added as she pulled up into the house. "And I know my job will be here in a few minutes so I'll just be sitting at home doing paperwork for tomorrow night."</p> <p>"Sounds like a lot of work." He replied as he looked out the window. He saw a small group of people sitting around a table working on a small business they owned in a large stone town behind a large stone building, and he could just make out a figure on the patio with a cigarette in hand waving at them as he approached them.</p> <p>"It seems we've caught up on some stuff that the shop will be needing before tomorrow." He said as he started walking up behind her as she sat on his other side. "I'll be right out." He said as he leaned down and kissed her cheek. "I hope you don't mind me calling it a day. I need to get back to my office."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. We can talk here and at home." She said with a smile. "By the way, it looks like you're going to be working on some new tools tonight."</p> <p>He laughed. "That's definitely something I want. I don't know what I'll do about it. I don't know how much longer I can hold out without really being distracted by you. Maybe another time then." He added. He pulled out his phone to call his boss for the day, but he decided to keep his phone with him. "So what time do you want to tell me about your day?" He asked.</p> <p>"I don't really have to go." She replied before he could answer. "I'm still kind of on the other end of the phone and don't want to leave a note right now. " She added as he moved the phone back out to his ear. "What?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm thinking that maybe we have to stop in at my house tomorrow afternoon and we can start working on stuff here." She replied as she started to get up but just stopped as a car door behind her stopped her.</p> <p>"What the hell?" He said with surprise as he reached out grabbed her and pulled her back down to him so that she was leaning against him. "What are you doing?" He asked. "It's Sunday! And we never get to finish this meeting anyway."</p> <p>She lifted her head up and looked at him. "What meeting? What about that day before this one?" she whispered. "What do you think my husband and my boss could get up to at my house? Or better yet, how about the meeting with me this morning before I go out for lunch with you and your boss."</p> <p>"What? Your boss? You said nothing about his meeting and everything about the meeting."</p> <p>"I told you. As a matter of fact, I do the same." She smiled as she leaned back into him. "Why bother? I'll just stay in my office and wait for you. I hope no one has been called in to do anything else."</p> <p>He leaned into her and reached down and pulled her head back. "Okay. Fine. I said nothing about his meeting and nothing like that." He said as he gently pulled her face back to his. "Don't keep me in suspense. I know that doesn't mean much to you, but this is important."</p> <p>She smiledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
