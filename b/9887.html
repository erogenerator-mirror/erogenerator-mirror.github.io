I knew I shouldn't.</p> <p>"Don't go."</p> <p>"I don't think I can."</p> <p>"Don't go," I repeated. "You want to do something. I can guess.</p> <p>"Nooo," he whined. He began to whimper.</p> <p>"Quiet or we will finish," I said, trying to make it seem more like a threat than a question. My own body had responded to me, and I knew it was good, so I had to play along with this bastard.</p> <p>He got up and I followed him to the bathroom. He sat on the toilet while I got a washcloth and cleaned his cock and balls. I was getting ready to turn up when the room lights turned out. The door of the bathroom opened. What can I say? I had to be careful not to make a sound.</p> <p>"Is there some danger?" she asked.</p> <p>"No," I said. "I just want to pee."</p> <p>She did. I went back to the bed. She had the vibrator in her cunt while she was peeing, and was massaging her clit with the vibe. I was close to coming, so I sat on the bed and kept the camera. I tried pushing it towards her face, but it kept getting in my way. I was losing control. I felt like my cock was going to explode. I grabbed the vibrator and stuck it in my mouth. As soon as I did, I felt her pull the vibe out. At the same time, she pulled the vibe in her mouth, turning it on.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels great. I can start to cum again."</p> <p>"You've got to be kidding," I heard myself say. I couldn't make out anything except the sound of her sucking and her moans.</p> <p>"I am going to fuck you now," she told me, sliding the vibe back into her cunt. She pulled the vibe out of her mouth. She was about to turn it on when her body began to shake over the edge.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she said. "Fuck."</p> <p>I had a good view of the entire encounter. I heard a familiar sound, a sound I had heard many times before, just outside our bedroom door.</p> <p>"Fuck," I heard again, and then everything went black. I had no idea if he was in the bathroom, but it sounded like there was a person in the bathroom. I heard a familiar voice. It was Bob, but I could not tell who he was. I opened my eyes, and there they were.</p> <p>"Good morning, lover," Bob said, putting on his robe. His left hand was resting on my leg.</p> <p>"That wasn't a good morning, I see," I said. He grabbed me and held me up against the door frame. "Oh, fuck," I repeated, and I felt tears well up in my eyes.</p> <p>"I got us some breakfast," he said. He kissed my cheek. The smell of coffee and biscuits was intoxicating.</p> <p>"Why did you do this, and you want some breakfast?" I asked. "We've got to leave."</p> <p>"That might depend," he said as he held me up against the door, our hands interlacing. "You want breakfast?"</p> <p>"You get out of here, and I'm leaving," I said, as his erection against my stomach was starting to tell the tale.</p> <p>"No," he said, squeezing me. "You go to the bathroom now."</p> <p>He closed the door, and I could hear the shower running.</p> <p>"I think there is hope here, though. I'll see you in the morning, when I get a chance," he said, pulling at me.</p> <p>"I hope you do."</p> <p>"I'll always be here," he said as his hand reached out and fondled my cock and balls. "I've just got to make you cum, before it's too late. That's all."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I'll be back in a minute," he said, giving me a kiss on the lips. He was gone through the door when I went to our room to change out of my robe. Bob had never left me before. I was glad he had. I was still trying to catch my breath when I found a warm shower.</p> <p>I washed my hair and dried it, getting it shiny looking too. After I put on a nightie, I was feeling good. I took a bathrobe out of its hook and walked into the bedroom. As I walked, I was still naked from the previous evening.</p> <p>Darling, come and sit with me. I've missed this."</p> <p>"Andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
