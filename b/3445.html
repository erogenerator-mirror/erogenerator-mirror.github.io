Mary said as she grabbed my cock and held it as she squeezed to bring it back up into her pussy. "You'll love sucking his dick. Oh, yeah. I'm going to ride him for a few minutes while I ride him."</p> <p>I felt my balls tense again as Mary's pussy squeezed me so tightly I was afraid she'd be able to continue riding him any more.</p> <p>"I'm ready to cum." I heard myself say as I felt Mary's pussy tighten even more.</p> <p>"Yah, yes. Let it in. I'm going to ride your cock until the last. Now let it come. I want you to cum with me." Mary said as she continued to ride me.</p> <p>I could feel my balls tighten and knew Mary was close.</p> <p>"Let it go. Let it all you want. Here it comes!" I felt Mary's pussy twitch as her orgasm continued. I knew even if she said I should stop, she wouldn't have said stop. I felt her wet pussy squirt her ejaculate as I continued to fuck her. She fell forward on top of me as we both finished.</p> <p>"So, does he like being a slut?" Mary asked as she let go of my cock. "What did you have to say about that?"</p> <p>"Yes. You are the sexiest woman I've ever known. And you have the best pussy." I said feeling my cock harden again as I said this.</p> <p>My cock felt soft inside her as she lay next to me. We lay for several minutes before she moved. "Come on, go home. When you get to your hotel, we can get cleaned up and go on our new world." Mary whispered looking across the pool.</p> <p>"Yes, we might have a new life, but we'll have one long enough so they can get back to what they used to be." I said walking to the bathroom.</p> <p>Mary got in the shower next to me. I took the soap as she soaped up and we did our normal wash the rest of the time our hands stayed locked together under the water. Mary had soaping my back and legs and as we washed each other we felt a new closeness as if we were making new love. We got out of the shower and went to my room while our hands washed each other. We both got cleaned up and put on robes and went downstairs to the table.</p> <p>As Mary sat across from me I noticed the same look on her face I had seen on her face the first time I had seen her naked. She seemed relaxed as though accepting me into her world. I didn't see any sign she had stopped feeling shy as she made eye contact as I stood by my hotel. When Mary got up, I got a cup of coffee in the room from the counter and sat next to her.</p> <p>"So, did you get off?" I asked as I looked through my robe at all the clothes.</p> <p>"Yes, I did. We did it all." Mary whispered as she looked at my robe. "And I want you too. I'll let you know if my body is ready."</p> <p>After we had eaten our coffee, we started to read or watch a movie and Mary went to the toilet again. I continued getting the bath water running as Mary continued cleaning me, giving me lots of space to get in.</p> <p>After a couple minutes I started to get to know Mary very well as she put her arm around my waist. I could feel her breasts press against my side and the tips of her nipples.</p> <p>"I'm going to try to stay true to what I'm thinking of. I'll come back on Sunday evening, but I hope it won't be a problem." Mary whispered as she leaned into me and kissed me.</p> <p>"We will, won't we?" I whispered back.</p> <p>"Yes, we will. We have things we'll have to get ready for." Mary said as she bent to kiss me again.</p> <p>She turned to leave and I watched her long legs as she rose. She turned back to me and again kissed me. This time I kissed her too, but before our lips touched, I could feel her nipple hard against my chest.</p> <p>"I'll get dressed." She said finally as she stood.</p> <p>"Mary, do you have a place for dinner?" I asked as I stood and put my robe on.</p> <p>"Yes, I do." She said as she walked to the table.</p> <p>"Let me get dressed. You just wait here. I'll be right back." I said walking toward the exit.</p> <p>Mary stood with her hand caressing the top of her robe. "I love doing this. Thank you. You just waitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
