He moaned into her mouth and she responded by kissing him even harder. With an arm wrapped around her neck, he pulled her against him, kissing her all the way down her neck to her soft shoulder.</p> <p>"Hmmm...this is soooo nice," she whispered with a sultry smile.</p> <p>She released her breath, and opened her eyes to find him staring down at her with those gorgeous brown eyes. The tips of her fingers brushed along his beard as his lips kissed down her chest to the curve of her breasts. She squealed, writhing against his body. She couldn't believe how good it felt...and how sexy he was.</p> <p>His hands slipped up to cup her breasts and he teased her nipples before sucking each one into his mouth. She moaned and arched up against him, her hands moving to rest on his shoulders. She wanted him even more, but he seemed to have other ideas. With one hand he took one of her nipples between his fingers and began to roll it back and forth. She bucked against him and her head fell back.</p> <p>"I shouldn't..." he groaned, pinching and pulling on her nipple.</p> <p>"Don't what?" she begged, her hips writhing against his.</p> <p>"Don't make love to me!" But his lips brushed her ear, and he gave a sexy kiss there.</p> <p>"Don't make me," she told him, her eyes half-shut.</p> <p>He let go of her nipple and pushed her back onto the lounger. She couldn't think straight, but she wanted him. Her eyes looked up to see his gaze fixed on her as he pulled his shirt over his head. She couldn't move, he was so strong and powerful...she wanted to feel him inside her just as powerfully as he was inside her. She spread her legs wide open, then opened her eyes to see his cock.</p> <p>She had a feeling this was going to happen, but she also knew he didn't have to rush, he was the perfect man when it came to making love. He sat up beside her, placing his hands on her thighs. She leaned into him, pulling him on top of her. She saw the look on his face, she was surprised and thrilled, and she was on fire. He kissed her lips. Their hands met, and he cupped her face. She smiled up at him with her eyes full of love and passion. He kissed her throat and she moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>"We're going to do it now," he said.</p> <p>"No," she said, and pushed his shoulders.</p> <p>"No? What do you mean?" she asked, holding his hands.</p> <p>"I mean you can't go slow until I fuck you," he said, reaching back to grasp her breasts again.</p> <p>"I'm telling you I can't," she said with an arch in her brow. "But there will be plenty of time for that later. I want this. We don't have much time."</p> <p>"No fair!" she exclaimed, but he stilled her by placing one of his hands atop her leg. Their lips met as he began to gently rock his hips against her, causing her to grind against his hard cock. They kissed, and she ran her hands through his hair. When he rubbed his fingers down her inner thighs she reached down and began to stroke herself, feeling his cock throbbing between their bodies.</p> <p>He let go of her thighs, and moved back to kiss her. The kiss was so sensual, she could feel his fingers stroking her body along her skin.</p> <p>"I don't want you to ever stop," he groaned.</p> <p>"But I need you inside me," she told him, stroking her inner thigh.</p> <p>He sat on his knees, kissing her again. He teased her as he worked his kisses down her neck to her collarbone. She arched against him, feeling the heat of his body against hers. She pulled a knee into her chest, causing him to press against her. Once his knees were wide, he kissed his way right up the inside of her thigh, stopping to run his lips over her lips and to the other.</p> <p>When his hot breath brushed against her pussy lips, she lifted herself off a lounger. She felt like a ball of heat, dancing before his eyes, his lips, his hair...she moaned and shuddered as she felt his fingers start to stroke her again through the thin lace of her underwear.
