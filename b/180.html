"Why did you ask?" she asked, holding out her hand.</p> <p>I could see a smile on her face. "Sorry?"</p> <p>"No, not sorry. I just, really don't know, when the time is right."</p> <p>I put my hand in hers and gently shook it. I tried to think of things we could say to help her and when we were ready for that, I would tell her.</p> <p>"I have to be honest. I couldn't resist if he was there to see us. I've been with my father and then only mom ever once, and as it went on, all his years of being around me and my family was just more of a family thing. And it didn't end up with him finding out how much you two were having sex, though it was always pretty bad." I paused to wipe a tear from her eye. "It wasn't like that."</p> <p>"Oh, did I hear something wrong?"</p> <p>No, she wasn't hurt, just confused.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Then why would dad be upset at something that was only a couple of hours away?" She got to her feet, smoothed my head with her hand. "I don't know about you, Brad, but I am seriously going to ask him the same question you asked me about my parents."</p> <p>"What's yours?"</p> <p>"My dad."</p> <p>"Oh, I see. Well, it's true, even if dad knows some of the background. But did he actually tell you about his mother?"</p> <p>She paused a second. "No."</p> <p>"But he told me."</p> <p>"You told him." She smiled at me.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I reached over and took her hand. "I need to tell you."</p> <p>She pulled back a little bit and put a finger to my lips. "No, let's wait."</p> <p>We walked over to a couple of rooms, opened them, and pulled out a chair for her, so that we could sit side by side at the table. We sat and talked a little, trying to get her to start telling me something she thought I couldn't.</p> <p>"My parents divorced when I was very little." She paused again, putting her finger to her lips for the same reason that she had. "They lived in a nice house in a nice city. She had a lovely car but it was no real comfort. When she got to school and I finished high school, she fell in love with one of the boys at school, which is why I was there, at first. As soon as I saw her, that wasn't going to stop. I told her, and when I saw the love in her eyes, well, it just just made me want more. She was a big girl at home, and I took advantage of her being that way."</p> <p>I looked at her. "When she got home from her date with that other boy, she told me all about it, so I wasn't as naive as you think."</p> <p>"I'm sorry." She looked down and me, for the first time since we sat down I did the same with her. She didn't say anything about it.</p> <p>"Why didn't you tell me, I mean, if you had I guess we wouldn't have jumped up and asked you."</p> <p>"So I told you, you have to wait until you were married to know."</p> <p>"What? Why are you talking to me about this?" I asked.</p> <p>"Because you're my dad."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know I'm that."</p> <p>She looked at me then and she really did. Her eyes were a clear blue as she spoke to me. "Well, I guess it's good that you two were in a hurry. We'd love to see you, though, since that's where we'd do dinner tomorrow," she said, leaning in.</p> <p>"We'll see." I leaned back. "We still need to try to have a good time for a year." I looked back at her.</p> <p>"You still have school," she said. "You can do it. I can do it." We both smiled at that. "Besides," she added with a smile. "My parents were in the habit of taking courses in life to prepare for a year. We could watch one of our movies or watch something else later."</p> <p>"Can you show me?"</p> <p>"I'd love." She reached up, put her arms around my neck and kissed me. I responded, and our kisses slowly started to work in concert, with her arms around me tightly. We moved one of our legs and pressed it against myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
