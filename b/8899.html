He smiled and said, "Well go for it you know he is going to get his chance later,"</p> <p>I looked up at him and laughed and said, "Well don't just sit there I want to do it." He laughed and walked over to me and sat down. He had a tight fitting tee shirt and a pair of jeans on and I could see his cock was already starting to harden.</p> <p>I started walking over to him and he just walked up to me and pulled me up. I knew his dick was starting to strain against the zipper because he had to get comfortable. My mouth opened and I pulled my lips from his and kissed him. His hands went to my blouse and he pulled it up as he kissed me. I knew he wanted it off and I lifted my arms so that he could do it. I was breathing hard and he took his hands and slid my bra straps over my shoulders and let it slide away from my chest. I stood back as he removed it. I had a great body he wanted to fuck but it was all that was mine. I don't know at what point that I said I was going to give it to him. I walked over to the bedside table and stood at the foot of it. I was standing there in my panties waiting to see what would happen. I saw him looking at my and said, "Let's go," and he started to walk over to the bed. I walked slowly over to him to get close to him and put my arms around him and hugged him. I kissed the base of his neck and down his earlobe, he was breathing in short gasps. "I'm going to make you scream at the end of your life," I whispered very softly. I kissed his ears and down the side of his neck. My hands slid down to his butt and I felt his muscles flex as I kneeded my tits around his back and pulled his shirt from his jeans. I ran my hands down to his knees and down his thighs. As I did that I ran my hands up his thigh and under the bottom of his pants.</p> <p>I had to get away. My hand dropped to his waist and I felt his cock, it was pulsing a little with blood. I grabbed his shaft and ran my hand up and down slowly, taking care not to touch his cock. He moaned and leaned back as I rubbed up and down the back side of it, feeling the veins move back and forth, getting it harder as it expanded and began to throb at my touch. I knelt down in front of him and took his cock in my hand and slowly pulled it up and down. I saw his pre cum come out and started to lick it off. He loved that so I took one hand and took my panties off and bent over. I grabbed his cock and shoved it back into my waiting cunt.</p> <p>He moaned and leaned down to kiss me as I fucked him. We were soon locked in a hot heated embrace as he buried himself into me and his cum came shooting out into me as we fucked. Our bodies had begun to relax and he kissed my chin and I kissed his lips and we went back to the same room to clean up.</p> <p>"How could I turn down something as tasty as you are," he joked and I told him I loved itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
