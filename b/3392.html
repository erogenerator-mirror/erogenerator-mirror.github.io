I pushed it down deeper into my shorts, and my hands were wandering down to my cock. I was so turned on by what was happening with my friend, that with every touch, I became more aware of my own excitement. I let my hand fall on my thigh and I pushed it between my legs. I was gently stroking my cock, when I felt the back of a fist slowly rubbing up my butt hole. The wet sensation and the hot feeling of the hand I touched was enough to push me over the edge again. I looked over at my friend, her eyes closed and she smiled back at me. As I watched, I felt the heat of the hand on my butt. She slowly began to rub along the small of my back, moving closer and closer to my dick. I felt her hand running over the back of my head where my hair had been. Then, without warning, her fingers wrapped around my base. I leaned back to watch as her palm was pushed against my cock. It moved in tiny circles on my skin as her hand pushed against me. "Ohhh," I gasped.</p> <p>The feeling was even more intense as I thought I had finally found the courage to say or do something. I turned to look at her and she was still smiling at me and she kissed me lightly. "That feels nice," she whispered as she looked down between our bodies. "It feels so good to me," she continued. My head was lying back on the pillow as I let my fingers play along her arm and down until she stopped touching me. She turned her hand and she slowly traced my length up the sensitive underside and over the head. As I watched, she slipped her other hand under my shorts and pulled my hard cock out. I looked over at his crotch where it was pressed against his hard on, but he didn't touch himself. "He did?" I asked.</p> <p>"He liked it," Lisa responded. She smiled again, before she let her fingers run up my thigh and touch my balls. My hard cock was trapped between her thumb and her hand. She cupped them and slowly started to rub. Her soft, warm hand felt so good. I closed my eyes. A feeling of pleasure built within me that was never going to be completely satisfied. "I feel pretty good right now," I finally admitted. "Maybe it's time you took care of me."</p> <p>She pulled her hand away from my cock and I could tell she was getting a little disappointed. "I've been watching this for weeks," she laughed.</p> <p>"I know," I replied. I felt the tip of my cock on her cheek. I could see how much it was hard for her to do because the light brown hair was covering my head. I could then imagine my head and my entire groin pressed into her face. She took my cock in her hand and slowly began to stroke me. Slowly at first, she ran her hand up and down my shaft, each time coming closer to my head. "This feels so good." She said as her hand slowly moved over me, caressing my hard mushroom cap the way she had before. I couldn't help but to lean back to give her better access. I could tell she was giving me an orgasm building within her. "I've never felt something so good," I finally spoke, "I've never felt anything like this."</p> <p>"Me either." She responded, "You were a first class man at college. I bet you had all the girlfriends you wanted."</p> <p>"Oh, yes." I responded. "I think I've never felt anything like this before," my voice trailed off.</p> <p>"You're going to cum," she whispered, "your cum is going to erupt all over my hand." A warm, wet feeling engulfed me as I watched my friend stroke me. She was so close and I was so turned on by the sight of my naked friend with her hand wrapped around my dick. After her hand got to the base of my shaft, I watched as her fingers continued to move up and down. I could already feel my balls starting to contract. "That's it," I moaned as a final orgasm broke over me and I pushed my cock against her face and I watched her as the intense pleasure rocked my body. I closed my eyes again as my cock spasmed inside her hand. "I am going to cum again," I spoke, "please can I cum?"</p> <p>She put her hand back onto my cock and kept the pressure as she began to rub herself. "I think it is just about you," she cooed, as she rubbed my shaft. "Let me make it harder." My hand grabbed my cock and pulled it back out from between us.</p> <p>She put my dick back in her hand and held onto her hair for balance as she leaned forward, slowly and lightly pushing her lips closer to my head. She opened her mouth, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
