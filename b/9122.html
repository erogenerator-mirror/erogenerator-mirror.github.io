We're not in the best position that we can be when the police and paramedics call for you in this morning," I said, a little more firmly than I intended, but this time. "I'm already being questioned about something important I've been trying to keep a secret from you all morning and I'm gonna have to ask you to be truthful and admit that you got hurt. We're going to get you out of this room and it's going to be all over campus. By the time we get you to our hospital, we'll tell the police and paramedics that it was a sexual attack. It probably doesn't even start until we get you out of here though."</p> <p>"But that's all my fault. I didn't do anything to deserve this and I don't blame you," Sam said, the tears in her eyes almost painful. "Please don't take it the wrong way" she added plaintively, "It was really your fault!"</p> <p>"I wouldn't take anything personally from you. If I had any reason to take that kind of responsibility, you would've already been hurt, you know. I wouldn't be able to get off of this campus. At least the police will give you a chance to come out." I said, trying to comfort her.</p> <p>"I have to admit, I don't know why you're going through this, but maybe if you're honest you've been honest with me, so I wouldn't want to take on the responsibility and have you cut loose at my expense. But why now, it all falls into step when you're trying to come out of this in the most dangerous possible fashion. Why in the hell did you do this to yourself? You're a student and a person. And now we're going back to the question of how to get us out of this."</p> <p>"I'm your student," I said, a little more firmly as I sat down heavily on the bed. "You can't just walk away and say that you're no longer a student. You can't just walk away from this campus, no matter you get older and find yourself more vulnerable than ever, and if you don't walk away I'm not leaving."</p> <p>"And that's gonna happen?" Sam asked. "If I have to walk away and never return to the university? This whole thing is so fucked up and scary. I'm getting ready to call that lawyer."</p> <p>"Sam, if I have time to talk with you a second time to understand, then that's what you're going to have to do for me."</p> <p>Sam's face was suddenly bright red. She looked away, the tears still streaming down her cheeks as she looked up towards me, waiting for me to make the next move. "Mr. O'Farrell, you're a mess. I'm telling you right now that if I could just talk to you like this, I would have told you everything."</p> <p>Sam was almost pleading, and I couldn't help but reach up towards her shoulder to try and comfort her.</p> <p>"Sam, I think you understand," I replied, still keeping a cool and calm tone between us. "Look, I don't want to take advantage of you just because it means that you're a virgin. I don't want you to give yourself to someone, anything, and I'd never do a bad job when it comes to that. You just need to be honest when you're vulnerable and scared."</p> <p>It took Sam several long moments of her staring at me for me to get her courage up again. It took a bit, but eventually she managed to say, "Okay... but we can't do this again" and she looked deep into my eyes.</p> <p>"Sam," I said, as I sat back down on the bed and gently pushed her back against the wall. "I have to go. As soon as I leave this room, I'll be all right. Now let's not go down that highway again."</p> <p>It was hard to say anymore in the cold light of day, but we didn't have to. I didn't want to let Sam down. I had seen her like this before, the most amazing girl ever, but I knew she couldn't just go up to her dorm and tell me, "We've been through this already."</p> <p>"Now hurry," I said, getting out of bed. "And while you're at it, you're not going to regret that decision for the rest of your life."</p> <p>Sam went out in the hallway and closed the door. I was really trying to be a gentleman. I walked over to Sam's bed, took off my clothes, and got into bed with my beautiful brunette. It was a little after 9:00am by the time we were in bed.</p> <p>"We can't do this again." Sam said after we kissed tenderly on the lips forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
