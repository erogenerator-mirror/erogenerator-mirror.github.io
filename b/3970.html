The taste of myself on his lips was not unpleasant, but it was not the taste he had earlier. I felt our tongues dueling like animals. There was a passion I felt that I hadn't felt in years.</p> <p>I broke our kiss. I turned my face to his ear and ran a finger around his jaw bone. He gasped at my touch and responded by running his hands through my curly hair. "Don't ever be afraid," he said huskily.</p> <p>My fingers slid to the collar of his shirt and I lifted it, exposing his full face to be kissed. As our tongues met I unbuttoned his shirt slowly, pulling it from his arms.</p> <p>I could feel his pulse pounding in his chest and I could also smell his cologne and it drew me in as our mouths and faces began to touch with reckless abandon.</p> <p>My hands unbuttoned his pants and I reached down to feel his erection bulging through his boxers. I felt him jump when I touched him and I continued to run my hand up and down the length of his shaft.</p> <p>"Don't tease me now," I said huskily to him.</p> <p>"I'm not a tease. I'm an animal," he said in answer. "Take my pants off." He begged, his words so forceful I could barely hear them.</p> <p>I complied and he stepped out of his pants. He turned so that I could put him in my hand and I slowly traced the outline of his erection with my finger, stroking him in a slow, sensuous way that caused him to breathe fast.</p> <p>"Take my boxers off," he whispered softly. So softly, almost as if it hadn't been spoken, I watched his eyes. His pupils were wide and he looked as if he would burst if anyone could see inside him. My touch on his cock was electric compared to the earlier touch, but as my hand encased the length of him, I felt a surge of desire in him that went far beyond any sexual arousal I'd ever felt.</p> <p>"Take off your clothes," he implored in a whisper that I barely heard. "I just want to look at you."</p> <p>It was all I could do not to obey him. If there was anything special about him it was that kind of guy. I let his pants drop and he stepped out of them. His cock sprung up straight up as it did and it looked much bigger than I had ever seen one. I had never been a fan of big cocks and wasn't surprised I'd never handled one myself either. I had, of course, never experienced the pleasure of having a real one. I was too scared of hurting him to get him hard, but what a surprise!</p> <p>I stood straight up and he took my face in his hands and kissed me gently. I felt his hardness press against my belly and then he was sliding down to touch the softness of my skin. I turned to face him again and we held each other as we kissed and he rubbed his erection against me. "Oh, fuck honey," I groaned as he rubbed himself against me. He reached behind and undid my bra and lowered his head to my left breast. His mouth enveloped the hard little tip and he started sucking gently.</p> <p>He pushed the bra away, kissing and licking and I saw that he had a handful of the breast in his hand. His hand began sliding up and down the length of my stomach as he continued to suck and lick.</p> <p>"Oh, baby," I moaned softly.</p> <p>"You feel so good," he whispered. "I've always felt so good about me." With that he pushed me back on the couch, my legs dangling over the side, my panties down and off. He knelt up and took off my panties. "I want you to be wet for me," he said as he kneeled down between my legs.</p> <p>That's not as important as I thought. We were both excited, his eyes as wide as they'd ever been. "Do you like that?" I asked him breathlessly.</p> <p>"Mmm-hmmmm!" was all he could say back, and the sight of his hard cock, still covered by the wet underwear was nearly too much to bare. I was as wet as I'd ever been, even more so as I could see the precum in him and I felt it slide down and join the juices there.</p> <p>"Are you going to finish me off, honey?" he asked.</p> <p>"I want to feel that hard cock in me. I want to feel it in me. Can you feel me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, God, I'm so hard for you," he groaned out. "I'm going to make you feel so good."</p> <p>I pulled himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
