I pulled two bottles out and filled the glasses up, then sat down on the reclining couch, my glass on the coffee table next to where I was sitting.</p> <p>A look of disappointment crossed her face when I handed her a bottle. She was drinking a whole bottle of wine and wasn't ready for that.</p> <p>"I'll have another beer."</p> <p>As I handed her her glass she took it from me.</p> <p>"Here."</p> <p>I handed her another beer, but she took the bottle and drank the rest of it in one gulp. I watched her intently as she swallowed her fourth beer. She smiled then looked right at me. What was next? I was so wound up I had to hold on.</p> <p>"Are you really my woman? Do you want to be my woman, too?"</p> <p>"Yes! Yes!" She nodded, her expression suddenly a little uncertain. I had never seen her quite this way before and couldn't have imagined that I was capable of something like this. I was amazed I could hold a job in this age.</p> <p>Now I had to think fast; it had been a while. It had just been a few years since Mom and I had been intimate. I had thought it was long enough, but I had been sure that was only because she had been drinking. It was almost always just a lot.</p> <p>Then she saw the look on my face.</p> <p>"I'm not you."</p> <p>I felt like I had to say something, anything.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm your woman!" I repeated.</p> <p>She gave a little gasp, looking confused and a little scared.</p> <p>"Yes! Yes, I'm!"</p> <p>All of a sudden I was no longer so sure.</p> <p>"I'm not Mom's son! I should be married! I should be your woman!"</p> <p>Well, that was it. Everything was going to change, and I knew how to say the things I knew. And then I had to wait.</p> <p>"There is one thing. I don't actually know if it's appropriate to come into an adult relationship with the parents of another person, but if you want, well, that is fine. If you want to stay with me, or just take your relationship to a different place, I'd love to have someone you can be closer to. Is that OK with you?"</p> <p>Mom was staring at me. I felt her uncertainty. It made her seem fragile. She was still holding that empty glass in her hand and looked at me with uncertain eyes. I could barely hold my cool composure. This was crazy. This was an unexpected development. There was so much at stake.</p> <p>"What do you mean by relationship? I mean if I'm going to be with someone..."</p> <p>My wife had just looked at me with shock and shock in her eyes. It wasn't lost on me that her face was bright red and a little angry, but that just made me feel much better. The fact that she was seeing me as a man meant she did not think I was stupid. I was only trying to help her. Maybe I was wrong for not going for it now.</p> <p>"OK! Well, if you're sure..." I said hesitantly. "It really has nothing to do with the relationship we have."</p> <p>Her face had gone from neutral to angry, and she stared right back at me.</p> <p>I felt my face getting warm again.</p> <p>"So you're saying I should come to you and show you what it is you do for a living?"</p> <p>She looked a little relieved. I tried to be diplomatic and not to get my hopes up by making her look upset.</p> <p>There was definitely more to the conversation than meets the eye.</p> <p>"I mean, maybe." I nodded. "I'm just glad you're here and that this has nothing to do with any relationship. I'm sure it would be awkward for you if you kept seeing a woman half your age, for the first time. I would be the one asking you to stay with me."</p> <p>I could see her thinking this through.</p> <p>"But I still have to work at it."</p> <p>"You've just got to do everything I tell you to do, or else you're going to lose the woman you love."</p> <p>"That's fair, you know what I mean."</p> <p>"OK, then get up and get that shirt off."</p> <p>I was almost ready to call an end to the discussion on the matter when I caught Mom's eye.</p> <p>"What? Do you think I'm just gonna get in a fight aboutâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
