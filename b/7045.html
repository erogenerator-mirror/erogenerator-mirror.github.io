It’s the best”, he said in a teasing tone.</p> <p>“You’re gonna give me a fright”, I heard myself say.</p> <p>“Oh, right. Well, you know what I think.”</p> <p>I had never really been in the mood at all. The night hadn’t looked so hot by this time and I wasn’t going to have to worry about any more of the same tonight.</p> <p>“Please, I’m about to have a great fucking”, I said.</p> <p>"How do you want me to dress? I’m yours tonight,” he said.</p> <p>“What, ‘cause a quick strip dance or some?”</p> <p>“No problem and when you’re all naked and I’m ready, how about an encore?”</p> <p>“I know a way where that might actually work”, he said.</p> <p>I had to admit the outfit was sexy. As he handed me my drink I noticed he had a lot more in my drink. I wasn’t sure if I should be nervous or not. If I had any doubts then I could have sworn he got a peek at my nipples through my top.</p> <p>“Come on,” he said. “If you really don’t want to do this, just think of how much you’ve got for me with me dressed like this. Maybe we can get together to have a little sex.”</p> <p>My mouth fell open and my eyes teared up.</p> <p>“Oh, my god, this is great!”, I said.</p> <p>He led me across the living room and we paused for a couple of minutes to look at each other.</p> <p>“I love your outfit.”</p> <p>“Really?”</p> <p>“You bet. But maybe we should get another drink.”</p> <p>“I’ll wait for another drink to come here”, I said. “Do you want the lights down, or do you need me naked?” “No lights at all, but I think it’s time I got naked too.”</p> <p>I could hear myself saying, “Okay, well don’t start without me,” before I got it right again. He was watching a very slow DVD and when we were in the back seat he pulled my top off and I just let him stare at my tits in anticipation.</p> <p>“Like what you see?” he said.</p> <p>“I don’t think so. Oh, I’ll let you down, but if you don’t believe me look closer and you better check out my package too.” I said like nothing was happening.</p> <p>“Oh, I think you’re right. I’m glad you’re looking.” he said still checking me out.</p> <p>His hand was still stroking his cock and he looked so hot standing there in his shorts, which had the effect of stretching the shorts out in the front.</p> <p>“I’m glad I’ll be able to give you a full body rub.” He said. “You’re a beautiful lady,” he added.</p> <p>I had just enough time to step out of the car and come around to the driver’s door before he had locked it and was driving away.</p> <p>I was stunned. I’m a gorgeous woman, that’s what I thought, if you can’t see it. But my body was telling me that he was more than my type. I’m a young woman, probably in my mid and upper college and I was still a virgin. And the young man of my choice was a teenager. What I didn’t know was that he was an older man, about 30. He’s not fat and looks a little younger than he appeared.</p> <p>I wasn’t expecting to be with a man who dressed like this. I would have been happy with just having been without him.</p> <p>I was still dressed in my business suit when Rick approached me. “I brought you a drink”, he said. “I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable. But I hope you’re enjoying it.”</p> <p>“I am. It’s cool. I’m glad you came.”</p> <p>He grabbed my arm and pulled me back towards the parking garage. He didn’t even take my panties with him so I didn’t know—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
