I stood up letting my hair fall in my face. My breasts, my entire body, felt as though they were shaking. He slowly removed me from his mouth and walked up the stairs. I was still so excited and so nervous I never even knew I had another man in my life. But it wasn't anything that I was concerned with.</p> <p>He was carrying his tray of food and setting it down and putting my food down beside me. He was wearing a pair of khaki shorts and my shirt. He walked up behind me again. His hands slid up the back of my shirt and he pinched both of my nipples so hard I thought I was going to faint. His hot hands pushed the fabric of my shirt up and over my breasts exposing them. With the shorts pulled off my shoulders and he pressed the wet fabric of my bikini into my ass. My body was shaking. I could feel my wetness on his fingers.</p> <p>"Oh God, you're so amazing. I feel like my heart is going to pound in my chest right now," he whispered in my ear. "I like you. I like how you do things."</p> <p>"That I do," I said as I pushed his fingers away so I could see my own reaction in the mirror.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed me on the lips. I wrapped my arms around him feeling my heart pound as I kissed him back. His tongue entered my mouth. He slowly moved his hands from pushing the fabric of my bikini to caress each breast in turn. He pushed them even further than I thought they would. I tried to catch his hand between my thighs but he stopped me.</p> <p>"I like things a little different."</p> <p>"I like things a little different" I teased him and I kissed his neck while his chest rubbed mine.</p> <p>"I love when you're like this," he said.</p> <p>He pulled my shirt up and off then let it slip from her hands to land on the edge of the pool. As he reached up to put my top on I raised up and said," Wait." While he was still dressed he helped me step out of my shoes before removing the shirt from my body. He kissed each shoulder and then pulled me back into the water. As the water hit my legs I felt my thong getting wetter and wetter and my pussy getting wetter and wetter.</p> <p>"God this thing feels like heaven," he said between kisses as he pushed me back into the water.</p> <p>"I love what you're doing to me. When you're like this I can't stop thinking about you," I said as I pressed myself into him.</p> <p>He held me up with one arm around my waist to support his weight and the other arm around my waist, which was only just big enough to hold me. He pulled me into the water to stand on my feet again, then kissed me on the lips again. He wrapped one hand around my lower back and pushed himself in me. I moaned into his mouth when his cock came to rest against my ass.</p> <p>"You're so tight," he whispered into my mouth as he pushed against the opening of my pussy.</p> <p>"I love how this feels. Does that feel good?" I asked as I pushed my pelvis out towards him.</p> <p>"I wish I had a strapon and could fuck your pussy," he said as he kissed me.</p> <p>"You can't, because I can't. You're married to a Marine. This is not a time where your hubby does anything like this. It's just you fucking me," I said with a smile as he pulled himself out of me.</p> <p>"Not with a dick," he said then pulled my head towards him.</p> <p>He whispered in my right ear which turned into a moan as he slipped his dick in my mouth again. His hand had gone to my pussy which was dripping with the moisture of our kiss. He squeezed my tits as he slid in my mouth again. His other hand went back to my pussy which I was so close to coming. I slid my mouth off his dick and pushed my mouth up the side of his head.</p> <p>"It's your turn now," he said as he pushed my mouth back down to his dick and then pushed my shoulders down so he could push me backwards. I followed his directions and he slid himself back in my mouth. His hands went back to my tits but he took my right breast into his mouth, so I put an arm around his back to try to hold myself upright but my body was shaking. He was thrusting his mouth back and forth against mine while his hand went back to my pussy. His other hand cupped my right breast while his hand made wet noises that sounded so much like his dick sliding in and out of my mouth.
