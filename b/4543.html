Do you think it's time for me to come so I can go again? Or will you hold off until we get back?"</p> <p>"Yes," she breathed, "but please don't stop. I can't hold out for long. Now...?"</p> <p>She was back inside of me. I had a very, very, very long lasting orgasm, as I let her come. She was on her hands and knees. She was on her knees, with her legs spread... her right hand holding my head in front of her. Her right hand was on her stomach, her hands around my neck. Her arms and legs were wrapped around me. It was beautiful.</p> <p>At that moment, she looked up as I was finishing her. Her eyes met mine and, in the sexiest voice I'd ever heard, she told me how wonderful I looked... I thought "Fuck, that was incredible. Thank you."</p> <p>I laid her on the bed, and got on top of her. My erection was at her pussy, pressing firmly against her, as I started to move in and out. I wanted to feel her body, to fill it. I also wanted to see her breasts to get me off... to give me the feeling of being in her again... and now.</p> <p>I started to work my cock in and out of her, while she started to work up and down on me with her hips... moving the way I like it... my balls hitting her clit. The room seemed to get hotter as we got more vocal... our hands moving under the sheets, as we made sex sounds... we both moaning... our hands were on each other.</p> <p>She had a hand on my arm and her hip, and her hand on mine.</p> <p>The sound of the bed creaking was really getting to me. My cock felt so fucking good in her...</p> <p>That first night of a lifetime was magicalâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
