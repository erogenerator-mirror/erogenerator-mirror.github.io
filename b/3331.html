I was so wet my pussy lips were hanging out of my panties and clapping. He pulled them to the side and he could see my little pink clit sticking up out of its pink sheath, the little cock ring hanging loose and full of my cum juices. "Are you ready to cum? You ready to cum for my cock? Are you ready to cum baby? Are you ready to fill me up with your cum. Baby?"</p> <p>"Oh fuck yes!!" I hollered.</p> <p>I felt his cock twitch and jump inside me. It felt like it was going to come out inside me. His cock swelled inside my pussy and he began to ejaculate. Shot after shot of his warm thick sperm shot into my pulsing pussy. I loved the feeling his cum shot into me. He kept shooting into me as he pulled out and laid his head on the pillow. I lay next to him, my head resting lightly on his shoulder. I was totally spent now. He was spent to my delight. I wanted to go to bed, but first I had to clean up. I got up and wiped my hands and ass and then washed his cock and balls, cleaning them. He looked at me with lust in his eyes and smiled. I turned away and moved to the bedroom, where I laid on my back on the bed, pulling my panties down my legs. As I pushed them off my legs, they bunched at my ankles and fell to the bed. I spread my legs wide as I pushed the soaked fabric into my aching pussy. I looked over at the clock. Three in the morning.</p> <p>I pulled my panties off my legs and put them in my purse and then I got up and headed for the bathroom. I washed my hands. No sense in getting dressed, all I did was brush my hair so I could stand and I had some time to clean my face, the shampoo and shave so I wouldn't need makeup. I brushed my hair and put on some lipstick, making sure I painted my face a deep shade of red. As I brushed my hair I looked at my reflection. My skin was still glistening with sweat. I got the black dress that I had picked out and I put on the dress. It fit my body and fit at all the right places. It fit loosely and I thought it looked great. I had worn my hair down and straightened it out and it looked great flowing down over my shoulders. I put on a white silk blouse that barely came to the bottom of my breasts and a black skirt that fell about three inches below my butt. When I put on my heels the hem of the dress came to mid-thigh and the blouse was too low cut.</p> <p>I went to the lingerie department and bought 3 thigh high nylons and a garter with a 3" white silk thong bra. I looked at them again. Three feet shorter than I was and I didn't need to go down stairs to get them. I also got a pair of black stiletto heels and a pair of very clear patent leather shoes. I looked myself over in the mirror. I put my hair up and I looked real good. I was ready.</p> <p>I headed out the door on my way to meet Greg and his date. I was really looking forward to getting to know him. The evening was going wonderfully. I made sure the date was well worth it and we had a great time. When we got to his house we went from room to room checking out each one to see how they would taste. We went out to the car and got in the back seat. Greg pulled out the seat for me and I sat down. I sat down in his lap and laid my head on his shoulder. He laid his hand on my thigh and moved it up the length of my bare thigh and I could feel his hard cock straining against his pants. The next one was a bit harder. He pulled my dress off my shoulders so it dropped to my waist. The rest fell to my feet. We both got in the backseat with me facing the back. We were both naked in less than three and we were kissing. His hands were all over my body now, exploring my curves and my body. He got me into the back seat; he had a great view of my ass as I was in the door. I couldn't believe what was happening. I felt him climb the back seat, and grab the back of my chair. He lifted me bodily up and we drove him to the bedroom.</p> <p>He laid me down on the bed and he pushed my legs apart. He climbed on top of me and began to kiss my neck and shoulders as his fingers began to tease my nipples. I laid there helpless as he took his time, letting me get used to his fingers. He made his way down to my breasts. He teased my nipples with his tongue as hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
