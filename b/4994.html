I'll have to use it to see who goes who's." He replied with a laugh.</p> <p>"Where is it?", she asked, suddenly feeling guilty.</p> <p>"It's in my bag, take a look and then come to my flat," He said confidently.</p> <p>"But, I can't," she gasped, wondering where he was going with this. Should he bring his things downstairs? No, she thought. He has nothing to hide from her. He's only going to go to his flat, to use his phone and do the things for him. She was becoming more desperate.</p> <p>The thought that he could be doing a job, like this, to help her out in a way he had never done before made her clench her teeth. She was already in the clear and he'd only needed to go and use his mobile to call her. He could not be that man, nor that cruel. "Are you telling me that I can't do it", she whispered, as her mind raced. "You want me to go and try something with someone else?"</p> <p>"Yes, but, no, your husband is with someone tonight. What if he wants me to do the same again?" His expression seemed to say something different. "Does he mind you doing a favour to be with someone else?"</p> <p>He wasn't going to answer her. She looked at the time and then back to his face. "I need to use the flat now," she said, trying to sound like her own inner voice would work.</p> <p>She was desperate now. She had to see him again. She couldn't do this. She had no option, because they would meet at his flat that night, if she had to. The thought of trying something with someone else, was appealing. She'd never been in such an awkward position before. She just knew that what was going to happen now wasn't going to be about any problems. She could have sex with someone else, with him. And it wasn't going to be about her getting him all wet and begging him for sex. Yes, it was risky, but if it was going to be with a friend from work, it had to be with a friend of hers. She couldn't be unfaithful to her husband, to a man she'd only just met.</p> <p>It was wrong of him to be suggesting, yet he seemed to be right about her and she knew that she had to do it. There was nothing to stop her from doing it, with him. It would be wrong for her to do that. She couldn't risk losing a job. She'd already had a man in her bed. There was no need to think of that now. It was the best time for this to happen. She could go out with him, to a meal, to a movie or to a concert, anything, and let him have sex with her after, tonight. She could do that. She couldn't live in fear of what she would think of this. He would surely get a kick out of watching her get screwed, seeing her go down on another man, seeing her on her knees, having sex with her. She'd never had any such thoughts, especially of the possibility of an affair with him again.</p> <p>She put her feet down and sat on the edge of the bed with her back to him, feeling a chill run through her and she shivered a little. But, no matter, the thrill was all that she needed. She'd get her own back on this and go out. But, she didn't have one. So, she waited, not wanting to seem too eager. She couldn't be outed with any man. So, she waited. And she waited. In her mind of course, there would be no sex, even if she did say so herself. There was no danger of being caught. But, she was sure that there would be no sex, no foreplay, no romance, no sex. So, she waited. A few moments of frustration, she thought, before she had to look away.</p> <p>He'd been watching her for almost half an hour now, but she couldn't go that fast. He was waiting, but he was a few metres away from her, staring at her. She just managed to catch a glimpse of his face while he was staring intently. As an afterthought, he said, "You know, I was about to go home."</p> <p>"Yes, you are. You must be," she replied. That thought was too good to miss on the second thought. "But, I don't think my husband will be back yet.", she said in a very serious tone again. That only confirmed her own thought that this was a risk worth taking. The whole situation was too much.
