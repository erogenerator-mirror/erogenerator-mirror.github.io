For now, I had my arms wrapped around her and my fingers in her hair. The heat from her body was so intensely hot I feared my heart might burst. I felt like I was falling into a pool of molten lava. It felt so good, I had to fight to hold on longer.</p> <p>I felt my pelvis begin to jerk and thrust against her pelvis. I was so afraid she was going to make me cum, but to my surprise, my own body responded by giving itself to the moment. I began to feel my own body respond. My fingers in her hair pushed her mouth down onto my cock and she moaned deeply as her mouth continued to work on my throbbing member. I felt the muscles in her jaw working their own rhythm as my body began to buck against her lips. My hands slipped down to the side of her face as I pulled harder on her hair.</p> <p>I suddenly heard my girlfriend whisper, "It's okay, baby."</p> <p>I stopped moving, allowing myself to become lost in the feeling of her mouth on me. My hands moved to her head, holding her against my cock. I felt the muscles in her jaw and throat working as though they were trying to draw me in. The thought of fucking my little girl was all consuming. I couldn't move, it felt as though I was going to burst.</p> <p>She pulled herself off of me and kissed me on the mouth slowly, letting her hands roam over my body as our tongues probed each other's mouths. I couldn't believe how much she had to learn. With an exasperating sigh, she broke away from the kiss and looked at me with a smile. "It's okay to try," she said with a chuckle.</p> <p>She lay down beside me again and my mouth returned to take on her breasts. I took one of her nipples into my mouth, gently teasing it, then began to suck on it. She sighed and moaned as her body began to respond to my touch. She reached her hand up to find my cock as it continued to grow and twitch. I felt the blood returning to it through the hardness of it beneath my hand. I could feel her hand caressing it as she played with my cock, feeling the blood pumping into it. I felt the other nipple respond and she moved it to the side, allowing me more access to it. I worked on her a moment longer, feeling her tongue running back and forth across my head. I moved to the other one to repeat the motion, feeling both nipples respond to my tongue and face. I gently moved my mouth back to the front of her body and sucked on her nipple hard while my fingers caressed the inside of her thigh and ran across her pussy, the first time her body had ever touched it.</p> <p>She gasped when I pinched the one in my other hand, sending bolts of electricity through them.</p> <p>"You like that?" I asked as I kissed her.</p> <p>"I like it a lot, but I don't know how much of it I enjoy it." She whispered, kissing my chest. "I usually do it the last couple of days after my classes, just before lunch time, but I've been wanting to do it for a while now."</p> <p>"Oh, I bet you've been wanting to do this a long time, too," I answered, my mouth returning to hers again. This time, I didn't force my kisses into the girl I loved being kissed around the mouth. Our tongues danced while our hands continued to knead each other's bodies.</p> <p>"I was a little worried that you might want to do more than just rub my ass," she said in a slightly giddy voice.</p> <p>"We haven't had sex, we just met. I just wanted to get off. It feels great, but it feels wrong, like I have to use lubrication. It feels like something big is going in me."</p> <p>"I know what you mean. I've had a few in the past, but I never thought I'd ever feel this way, especially with the way you're reacting. I like it a lot."</p> <p>I reached out and slipped my fingers beneath her panties, feeling my way up her inner thigh. It began to feel good when my fingers came to rest at the top of her pussy.</p> <p>"I think you're ready," she whispered, pushing my hand away.</p> <p>"Let's go," I said, pushing her back onto the couch.</p> <p>Taking one of my hands from her hair, I spread her lips with my fingers and brought them up to her sex. I leaned in for a kiss as the excitement grew between us. Her hands pulled my face closer to hers as I parted her lips and ran my tongue against her clitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
