Did I have to put my finger on your ass to get you to do what I asked you to? Did I have to put my finger on your asshole to let you know what I was going to do? Was I supposed to be able to fuck your ass without you knowing? It's OK for a beginner to know what to do, but I'm gonna try again. It's not something you have to know for sure, like you'll know it when you're having anal sex. The bottom of my cock is nice and thick, so the feel and sound of it will be very pleasant. I'll let you know when to start pushing in and, of course, when to pull out. It's just a precaution. I'm not trying to hurt you; I just want you to know what you are going to feel next." He said to encourage her. When she did this, she looked back at him and saw how much she enjoyed being pleasured by him. Her head bobbed back and forth against his hand. Her eyes were focused on his hand working a cock faster and faster. This position gave her an incredible view and he was still fucking her as well. She felt like that position gave him all the control he needed to get himself off. That made her feel so powerful that she wanted him to do things.</p> <p>He reached behind her and found that she was not wearing any panties. His fingers found her wet slit and slipped between her open thighs to rub against her clitoris. She moaned a little as he pushed his finger into her body. He continued this until they both moaned audibly when he found that she was indeed completely soaking his hand. He withdrew his finger, but stayed in place, letting her adjust when she wanted to cum. His fingers were slick with her juice and he slowly stroked them across her bud, then back to circle it on his way back.</p> <p>She was starting to move against him and heard him moan in delight. She could tell from the pleasure he was giving her that she liked the feeling. It was so hard for her to concentrate on anything now. She wanted to cum. Maybe, if he could hold onto her, she could cum again and he wouldn't hold her.</p> <p>After a few more minutes, he pulled his finger from her body and she let out a little disappointed sound. He said, "That felt good, but now it's my turn to suck you off. I'm sorry. You need to be ready to cum."</p> <p>"No, not yet." She was beginning to think that she could actually climax from this. It was such a new experience for her when he sucked her lips through his teeth. She opened her mouth to catch some of her cum, but then saw herself open her mouth as wide as it would go. She opened her mouth again, and found that she could control her own breathing while she sucked and swallowed. She found herself thinking of the taste of her juice on his hand as he moved it around with his mouth. It wasn't just his hand, but the way he used his eyes and his finger.</p> <p>He moved back to the bed and got a condom out of his underwear drawer. She watched as he slid it on his cock and then felt her body start to relax with him behind her. He had his weight back as he pressed the tip of his cock against her wet pussy. He had been pressing against the small opening of her body, then pulling back just as her body adjusted to his size. Once he was inside, he felt his cock sliding in one motion. The sensation was so good to her that she felt he was going to cum immediately. She pulled back to him a little more, and then he was in and all of it. His cock felt so good and felt great there as he pressed back against her, then started to pull back. The feeling was wonderful to her and it made her feel good.</p> <p>He found himself pushing inside her a little more and knew that she wanted that feeling. He had never wanted her to cum because she would usually wait until he was inside of her for a second before he did the same. He felt her body tense again and just as she began to relax, he felt her body relax again. She started to let out the sounds he was beginning to listen to. They came from deep in her chest and he knew she had felt it. She had been moaning, and from the sound of it, she was beginning to lose control.</p> <p>He wasn't sure how much more he could take. Her pussy felt like a tight, hot, slick glove encircling his cock as it plunged in and out of her and he wanted to cum just one more time in this position. He wanted to feel her body completely relaxed and wanting this to continue. He held just his cock inside of her while they both relaxed and enjoyed the feeling of a different body.</p> <p>The next few minutesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
