I don't know if this is a good omen?"</p> <p>"Let's not tempt," I grinned, as my hand ran down her back and over the bare cheeks of her bottom, "We can work something out, OK?"</p> <p>She nodded enthusiastically as she stood still, her eyes looking up into mine.</p> <p>My hands moved to her shoulders, brushing the blouse up and gently, gently rubbed her shoulders before I pulled the material down from her neck, her shoulders, arms and above the back of the chair.</p> <p>"Oh!" she murmured, almost breathlessly. Her eyes fell and gazed into mine as the satiny fabric slid down her arms and onto the chair, her hands clasped together in back of the chair. As the garment slipped from her arms she turned, her hands slipping up under the skirt before disappearing between her slender, silky thighs. I saw that her lips were swollen and her eyes were slightly open, and her small mouth formed an 'O' as her tongue moved across the upper lip, just shy of touching me. Her hands slid back to her skirt and undid the button before slowly easing the zipper down. She smiled at the sight of her fingers slipping into the waistband of the skirt, and looked back over her shoulder at me. "You're getting warmer down here, aren't you, Jack?"</p> <p>I nodded, my face bright red "You'd better hurry up, I want to concentrate in the front."</p> <p>She smiled at me, but seemed to have no idea what to say. With her lips still sealed in my face her hands slipped away and she started to unbutton her blouse, but I stopped her . I leaned across her, and the blouse slipped off, falling to the bed behind me. I took her blouse from her shoulders and slid her arms from it, laying it behind her, and then I slid the straps off her arms and slid the bra from her body, exposing her beautiful breasts, her nipples stiffening and almost poking through the thin material. Her breath caught as my mouth ran the full length of her, my tongue exploring the upper slope before reaching around to stroke the underside of one nipple, her fingers reaching back to grasp my head as she drew me into her. My hands moved up her stomach, cupping her breasts, before finding the fasteners to her jeans and then sliding them down her legs until they pooled at her feet. I stepped toward her, my body moving down so that her hands met my, one reaching under the skirt and cupping my ass, fingers squeezing my cheeks.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm, I can't wait," she murmured, closing her eyes. I watched as her hands slipped into the waistband of her jeans, pulling them down, sliding them to the floor. She wasn't wearing any panties, and the light, cool air felt wonderful against her skin.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, I can't wait, too!" she said almost in a hiss. "Oh yes, Jack, that feels so much better!"</p> <p>I stepped forward, pressing my body against hers, our hands going up to cup each other's breasts, first the large aureolae, then the large dark pointed nipples with their aroused tips. As she leaned forward to me, I slid my hands from her breasts, up over the soft satiny globes to rub across her swollen nipples. Her hips jerked forward, but still held in the pose I had hoped for. My hands moved downward, caressing her legs, her body starting to move with mine.</p> <p>"Are you all right, honey, you're all excited?"</p> <p>"Just a little," she breathlessly gasped. "But you have a big surprise for me, sweetheart. I've been thinking the whole time I was here that I would like to give you something special."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded, feeling the excitement in her as I watched her face as she spoke.</p> <p>"Would you like that, Jack, to do some kind of gift for me?"</p> <p>"Mmmmm, Mmmmm!" I replied, running my hands up and down her back.</p> <p>"Come on, babe, it's OK," she chuckled, pushing my shoulders back against her wheelchair, "We don't have much time."</p> <p>"But I want to. It's a surprise at least."</p> <p>Saying this, she pushed me from her wheelchair, pulling me away and onto the bed on my knees, my hands gripping the arm of the chair as I stood there, looking at her with a raised eyebrow and a sly smile.</p> <p>"OK, honey," she smiled back, her hands going up to unbutton my jeans, "Come on, let's get you undressed. Then you can have your reward."</p> <p>"Oh yes, Mommy," I responded eagerly. We slid our jeans down to the floor, myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
