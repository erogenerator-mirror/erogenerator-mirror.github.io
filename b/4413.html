He looked at me, naked with his semi limp cock sticking out from the opening of his robe, and I moved off the bed to him, sitting on the edge so that my breasts rubbed against his side, then began sucking him again, this time in the missionary position. It took me a little extra effort to get him fully hard in my mouth, and I kept gliding up and down, taking him back in my mouth. I looked back up at him as he looked me in the eyes, our faces only inches apart. He smiled down at me, and then leaned down and gently began lightly kissing me across the jaw.</p> <p>I kissed him back with all the passion and passion I could muster. He pulled me up and kissed me again, and then got off the bed to the floor as I returned to his side. Our kisses continued, as he began pulling off my shirt and began kissing his way from my chest to my throat and on down to my neck.</p> <p>"Now I want you to take off my pants, love." He whispered, and I just nodded, my head resting on his shoulder. He kissed me and I began unbuckling his belt. I pulled down on the front of his pants to allow them to open, revealing his dark hairless crotch. At least 6 or 7 inches, and thick. I reached up and pulled it out, and was surprised to find it was all darkening and growing. The tip was darkening as it grew and stiffened and got thicker. He lifted his hips off the ground and I slid his pants and shorts down, and off of him, tossing them on the floor with his shirt. Then I put my face in them, and began tonguing and sucking on him. My husband had me suck several dicks when I was younger, and had some of them at first, but I've never been with another man, let alone having a "real" penis in me, other than my own. This is probably the first time any man would be able to taste another man's precum, and he was doing a good job.</p> <p>I love sucking his cock. It's always been a turn-on. There are times I am not sure I'll want to be in another man's apartment. I've always considered myself to be straight, and I've always thought that sucking another man's cock was weird. But tonight, I was definitely different.</p> <p>He continued undressing me as I worked my tongue on and around his cock, then got my shirt off, which was now standing straight up on my chest. I loved it when he took it off. It was as if there was a direct line between his cock and my body. I could feel every muscle, and every nerve in it. I wanted more. He slid my pants and panties down and I stepped out of them, now completely naked except for my sandals. My body tingled, and my knees felt weak. I wanted more, but I couldn't just take them off.</p> <p>He sat, looking at me, and then he began unbuttoning his shirt. I was still kissing him and sucking on his mouth, and I was dying for his cock to give me relief. As he undid a button, and pulled it from his neck, I saw his black snake hanging there, pulsating just looking at me. And in his hand it was long and slender, and a bit bigger than Jim's. He opened it and looked at the head, and I looked at him, amazed, and then at the shaft. It's thick, and it looked so hot that I wanted to touch it, suck on it, taste it.</p> <p>As I looked around at all that was happening to me, I knew I was hooked on this man. He was beautiful. He was beautiful, and sexy. I wanted him in my mouth, but I didn't want him to get off. He took the belt from my wrist, and then slowly pulled it back, and I realized how sexy a man's body looks to me.</p> <p>He was completely naked. I pulled my eyes away and then went to remove his shirt and pants, then pulled up a chair, and sat on his lap. He reached one hand to my breast, and I felt his cock as it came up from underneath. The head was a light shade of dark that was different, and I felt a tingle in my chest, a shiver of anticipation and excitement. There was something deep and exciting about it. At first, the feeling was wrong. My nipple was hard, and straining against the cloth. I had wondered if it would be different, but not in a million years, and it felt different than Jim's. I took his head in one hand, and with the other hand, I began pulling his lips down, and then pulling them back. I had kissed some of the men I'd hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
