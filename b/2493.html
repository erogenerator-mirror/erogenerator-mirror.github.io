I asked him while he was still fucking me "It's pretty thick and long. Are you ready for me to fuck your ass?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes. Fill me with cock," he moaned into my ear.</p> <p>I pulled back just slightly and then thrust back into him again. We fucked as fast as our bodies would go but it wasn't long before each of us had a powerful orgasm.</p> <p>I lay on top of him as our bodies were still. He kissed me and we held each other for awhile before we separated.</p> <p>"Where's my ass?" I asked.</p> <p>"Him?" he answered.</p> <p>"You know I like it in the ass so I want it." He said</p> <p>"I know, I really didn't put much lube in it," he said with a wink. "Do it again." He begged as he lay with his head on my shoulder. "I want a lot of more of that."</p> <p>"We don't have to hurry. We have time." I assured him.</p> <p>"Please," he begged and I pushed him back on the bed. I straddled him where we were lying on our sides. I reached back and grabbed some lube from his night stand. I squirted some on the tip of his hard cock and began stroking him.</p> <p>"Now put it in me." Chris begged.</p> <p>I slid down on him again and felt the thick shaft as it sank deeper into my ass. I reached back and grasped his cock with my hand and began stroking him. His cock slipped deeper into me and I wrapped my legs around his waist.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck your ass. Fuck your ass and come in me." Chris pleaded. "I hope you like that. Come in my ass and let me feel your hot come in me."</p> <p>I stroked him as he drove his hard prick into me. Chris had a nice body with just the right size to me. I could feel his cock sliding against my prostate and his cock was getting harder in my fist. I leaned down and began kissing him again as he fucked my ass.</p> <p>"Do you want me to cum in your ass?" I asked as I stroked him faster.</p> <p>"Please." Chris moaned.</p> <p>"Oh yes." Chris begged again.</p> <p>My fingers were still stroking him as he drove into me. I felt his cock stiffen and then begin to pulse. It was already wet with his come.</p> <p>Our bodies were trembling together and the feel of his cock still in me sent me over the edge. I felt it and then hot spurts of sperm shot deep into my ass.</p> <p>I continued stroking and pumping his cock until it was limp in my hand. I pulled the spent cock out of my ass and flopped on my back next to him, exhausted.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" he asked after what seemed like an eternity.</p> <p>"I'm good." I answered. "I'm almost asleep." I asked when he was ready for more.</p> <p>"I know." He replied, lying beside me. "I haven't had such a great sex life. I don't think I've had sex like that in years."</p> <p>"Really? I've done it my whole life." I answered. "I've come three more times and I don't think there's anything in me that compares to that."</p> <p>"The only thing better is if you love me." He said. "I don't think that's a very fair comparison."</p> <p>"What do we have to offer you in the way of good sex?" I asked.</p> <p>We lay there talking and feeling each other. I thought I felt like we made love last night. There's no sex in my life. We were in one of the most intimate parts of me which I could think of only as a part of me and it wasn't in the body that Chris and I used to have.</p> <p>"I'm sorry it happened. My fault. I shouldn't have done that. I didn't mean anything by it. Please forgive me." Chris cried into my shoulder.</p> <p>"I know you didn't, but I think you should be punished for what you did to me. Did you do it in the way you wanted?" I asked softly as I ran my fingers and palms all over Chris's body.</p> <p>"I guess you're right. I did try very hard and I made it very hard but I couldn't even do that." Chris answered. "What I did was wicked. I just couldn't do it because I had to."</p> <p>"I know what you mean. Let's get dressed. You can have the rest of our evening off. I didn't think you'd like it." I responded.</p> <p>Chris did as he was told and dressed.
