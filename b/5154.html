He was tall and slender, and I guessed he had a nice build. It was obvious what kind of a man he was. I had a boyfriend by the way, and we got involved with a lot of girlfriends after the fact. There was no doubting it, either of us. He was really nice, too, and we were great friends, and it would have been good if he had been the first guy I had dated. We were always getting together.</p> <p>"Do you know her?"</p> <p>His voice was calm and easy, and I'm sure he was thinking that my curiosity had peaked, but I was scared to ask. I looked up. He was standing out of the water, and in my peripheral vision I could see his eyes were serious as he leaned back against a tree.</p> <p>"It's not going to be like that. I'm only thirty years old. I want to fuck her. Are you ok with that?"</p> <p>"Yes. I'm ok with everything."</p> <p>He smiled.</p> <p>"I've got your friend there, right?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah." I had heard her, but I had no idea who she was.</p> <p>"And you got her number?"</p> <p>"Well, she used me. Said she really liked it."</p> <p>He leaned back, then he pulled his hands up in a gesture of satisfaction. I guess I wasn't the only one to notice something in his demeanor. It was almost as if he was happy I'd found a boyfriend. I turned back around and looked at the trees and bushes. He hadn't come down the river, and for some reason was still in the water.</p> <p>"Well it kind of surprises me. This is my first time, and I've always thought you might be interested."</p> <p>He grinned.</p> <p>"Are you ready for a little fun? I could show you one time, you sure I don't mind? I have lots of stuff."</p> <p>I was starting to get a little worried. What if he really had the hots for me? We were already friends, but what about me, if I didn't get to know her? I decided to talk it over with him.</p> <p>"I'm okay with this. Just get dressed and we'll come down."</p> <p>I got out too, leaving him to run bare-assed and run in front of me in the water like we were two young kids. No one on the other side of the river would even come down and look at what we had on. It was only fair that way. I was about to sit down on mine when I heard his voice.</p> <p>"You know, that's something that probably won't be seen in here anymore."</p> <p>When he turned around and smiled at me I couldn't help but let go—for a moment, a moment. I was afraid I might have given them away, but I had never been that way before.</p> <p>"I guess maybe someone's been watching us, and they aren't looking back. I could do more, but you know I like it that way."</p> <p>He didn't answer, but I let that thought pass. He had a point.</p> <p>We were sitting there in the wet grass, and looking across the river at the other half of the lake. Suddenly, the guy who had talked to me on the phone turned towards us. He looked at the other woman, who had just disappeared from view.</p> <p>"I guess she was watching you."</p> <p>He nodded and smiled, then walked back up to the other side of the shore.</p> <p>"You're new. You were talking about her this morning."</p> <p>I tried to look shocked, but his smile was so nice and friendly and he sure didn't seem like anyone at all.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Bob. My girlfriend, Jen. You might want to get her out of your hair."</p> <p>He seemed to be waiting for me to say something; he was trying to look nonchalant, but I could see that the way he was talking had been a little flirtatious. I got my answer.</p> <p>"She's my girlfriend, Bob."</p> <p>"Is she beautiful?"</p> <p>"Yes." His face was almost angelic, with dark hair and eyes that shone through with health and wisdom. The way he was smiling gave me hope. Maybe this wasn't the real world after all.</p> <p>I felt like I would have liked to talk for a little bit. Then the man turned around and asked me something.</p> <p>"Do you do the movies, Bob?"</p> <p>"Yeah." I thought I might have gotten the idea all too quickly.</p> <p>"Good. I'm the hostess. If you want to join us, you can come with the others who are already here."</p> <p>He handed me the money, and I headed down into the water—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
