Just to see what the fuss is about, we decided to go see what happens when we get home."</p> <p>"Really? What did you have in mind?" John said smiling. "No wait, I don't think it was the plan. You know me, John. I'm a nice guy and I have friends and..."</p> <p>"Oh no, not friends," John said laughing "I like fun. You want to see my friends? I'm not going to be one of them, am I? I'm not even sure what to say to you and..."</p> <p>"No of course not, John. It's perfectly normal to be shy about being seen with another woman."</p> <p>"I...I'm still not sure where that is really going." John said. "It...it's...I mean...I...don't mean it to be that way is it?"</p> <p>"No of course not, John. I've seen a few other guys and...yes I had a few girlfriends at school."</p> <p>"Well no...that's not really true. It's actually quite rare for me to see a girl other than other girls."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"It's okay, John. It's not like I'm some sort of 'hooker,' but it's not like a lot of it is like...uh...sex."</p> <p>"That's all?" John said with a bit of a shocked expression.</p> <p>"Yeah and that's when they're all girls and it's...uh..." John started to say again, but was interrupted by the sound of a door opening down the corridor. "Oh, we have to go, John, I just want to be alone for a bit and...."</p> <p>"It's okay, John." John put his hand to the corner of his mouth to hide the smile. "I'm sure you've had more than one girlfriend already, you know?"</p> <p>"Yeah, and I definitely didn't see you at school either." John grinned. "And now here you are, just a...a girl looking for some fun!"</p> <p>"Well, I was planning to try and find my guy friend of sorts for that afternoon. I wasn't sure you would be interested in someone with more than that."</p> <p>"Well, I don't have a boyfriend." John said. "I don't have a girlfriend either..."</p> <p>"Well you better try him out before you pass out."</p> <p>"I...I don't know, I shouldn't really," John said, feeling as if his heart had stopped beating. "But that doesn't mean I'm not interested in another guy."</p> <p>"Yeah, well no, you are not. Now, go down to pick up your friend." She said, grabbing a couple of bags and leaving John to pick up his girlfriend.</p> <p>"Why are you doing this?" John asked. He then wondered why he had thought he could do this with her, but she just smiled as always and he decided to do it.</p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p> <p>"Oh, so my friend is hot!" Samantha exclaimed as John walked in the door. "I can't wait to see her!"</p> <p>"Oh my god! Look at me!" Samantha said excitedly, staring at John as he reached out to touch his wife. Samantha saw how hard John's cock was getting and she gave a soft groan.</p> <p>"I'm going to take a quick shower!" she smiled. "You can join me when you're ready."</p> <p>"Oh I'm sorry, Samantha...."</p> <p>"Oh don't worry, I can find someone to help me if that's okay with you."</p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p> <p>"So?" Sam asked, trying to get John's attention. "Is she interested in one of you guys then?"</p> <p>"No!" John said with a nod as he looked at her and smiled widely. "Not at all. I'm just thinking that I'm not sure that the two of us are really going to be...you know...part of something."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, you still have one more day to figure it out." She smiled. "How was work, Samantha?"</p> <p>"Worked great, John. The other two are already home now so we can relax."</p> <p>"Well, you're right and I am glad. I guess I'm not quite sure how to approach them about the threesome then." He winked.</p> <p>"So you're still dating her, John?" she asked with a teasing expression.</p> <p>"Of course I am! I mean, what's the point of breaking it off when your girl is still so turned onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
