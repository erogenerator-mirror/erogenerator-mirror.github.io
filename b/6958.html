She had only known Ben's cock before him and he had said it was his favourite thing to make love with her. Now it was actually her fantasy.</p> <p>"If you want me Ben you must do it." she said softly.</p> <p>"What exactly is this thing?" asked the voice that had sounded familiar to her.</p> <p>"Do it my sweet, but do it slowly, it's an old world thing." she replied.</p> <p>A rush of adrenaline gave a jolt through her as she stepped closer to him, the feeling of power washing over her as well as her brain.</p> <p>He pushed his hand against her back and pulled her into him. Their lips met once more and the heat between them grew until it was all passion. He pulled back from her, breathing quickly as he stood stock still, allowing her just to look into his eyes as he slid his hand up her thigh and began rubbing the skin up and down her wet slit.</p> <p>He groaned out her name as he slid his index finger gently inside her. It felt so good when he pulled it out and she smiled as she watched it glisten in the light from the lamp. Her hands went to her breasts and she ran her thumbs over her nipples. He reached out and touched them lightly.</p> <p>Hiram gasped as she touched the delicate flesh. She had never been so excited and loved touching herself. She knew she would love being touched that way but she didn't expect it to become this way. Instead, she felt as though she could do anything else.</p> <p>Ben was mesmerized as he watched his beautiful host touch herself, pulling on the nipples with her fingertips, moving her fingers in a spiral, feeling and playing with the skin of her breasts. She moaned as he pushed his finger in her and she could feel it move against his digit.</p> <p>As the waves ebbed inside her the fire inside the forest grew even more as she felt herself go into her orgasm, his fingers never leaving her breasts as she rubbed her clitoris in long hard strokes, making her whole body shake with delight as she came.</p> <p>"Ah yes." she panted as she looked into his eyes.</p> <p>Then she felt it, the same strong emotion she had when he had first touched her.</p> <p>"Thank you... I want to do that again." she croaked.</p> <p>"Go ahead, let it just flow." He said and bent down to whisper in her ear.</p> <p>"I want it to flow, but please don't move, don't push it inside me till I tell you!" she gasped.</p> <p>"Oh, I won't stop it if you don't mean it..." he teased.</p> <p>Then he pushed forward and found her clit, rubbing it quickly. She shuddered as a wave of pleasure went through her and she closed her eyes as she came down from the highest peak.</p> <p>He smiled, reaching up to take her hands and pull her back down towards him, planting a soft kiss on her lips and pulling the dress up to her neck.</p> <p>Her head fell to the side and her eyes closed as he rubbed the soft skin of her neck.</p> <p>She could feel the muscles in her stomach begin to contract, he took that as a sign and moved towards her, cupping her breasts gently. It wouldn't be long before he would have her orgasm again and she was not ready to wait.</p> <p>Ben pulled her away from him and led her over to where the fire was. Taking her hands he led her towards it, and laid her back on the log.</p> <p>"I'll do that again real soon" he said as he kissed his way down to her breasts.</p> <p>Her hands caressed the backs of his thighs, and she sighed as he pulled her arms up around him.</p> <p>"This feels better now, don't you think?" he asked.</p> <p>"Mmmhmmm..." she replied in a soft whisper.</p> <p>Plunging his head under the stream and her breasts, he kissed them, circling one with his thumb while sucking on her nipples softly, enjoying with them the way they felt in his hands.</p> <p>"Mmm..." she sighed as he kissed his way back up her body.</p> <p>She felt the heat of his face over her breasts as he kissed it through the soft cotton of her bra. The fire was slowly dying now, as his tongue slowly parted the wet flesh on the outside of the cups and sucked on first one nipple and then the other.</p> <p>She groaned with pleasure as she felt the sensations rolling through her body. His fingers worked between her thighs as he kissed her belly and pushed against her mound with his fingertips. He reached over and put something there but she jumped as it felt too small, almost as though it had been made up of her own bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
