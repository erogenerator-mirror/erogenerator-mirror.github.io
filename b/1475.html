I mean, when do you think I had to leave on another day out of school, huh?"</p> <p>I chuckled and put a hand on his shoulder before pushing him away. "You wouldn't want to see me get into trouble with my parents, would you?"</p> <p>"Nope, they don't take kindly to strangers being outside with their daughter. Besides, if they knew that I already had a date with your father, they would probably go nuts."</p> <p>"Well, I guess I just had a better time out than I thought, and I won't see you again."</p> <p>"Hey! What do you need a date with? If I can't have a date with you then I'll get a date with my best man!"</p> <p>"I know... but it's Friday night and your dad will probably be home from work. He won't be home until Sunday night and it's still a whole week before he gets in."</p> <p>"I'm already on my period and I'm still having trouble sleeping! It will be good to finally have a decent night out."</p> <p>"There's no need for that. I need relief now."</p> <p>I was still staring at him at that moment. I wanted him, as much as I wanted to have him with me all night, but the reality wasn't so good.</p> <p>"I'm just not sure, I mean, I've had sex before."</p> <p>"Me too, but to be honest, I guess there's not much in my repertoire."</p> <p>He smiled. "I just don't know about all this, you know, dating and stuff, but it really doesn't do much for our sex life." I saw what I did in his eyes, and decided to keep that little secret. I put my hand back on his shoulder in a soft way, and I'm sure that didn't put any pressure on him, either.</p> <p>So, we sat and watched the movie for a while while we caught up on what went on at work. I had a good time, and while it didn't do much for me, it made a lot of difference as friends with benefits. That was nice to know, and to feel a little better. I think the fact that it made some difference was a big contributing factor, the fact that it would have been better to have been dating someone instead of just going out with some girl you had dated for a while.</p> <p>Our conversation drifted into one of his favorite pastimes, and I knew that if I told him the truth, he'd be all that upset if I didn't. So, I just asked him to tell me.</p> <p>"So, what do you do for fun?"</p> <p>He gave me a long look. I'm not good with men and I didn't really know what he was into, but he could see that I was interested, and that he had to have a good time.</p> <p>"What do you do?" he asked.</p> <p>"What do I do for a date, or anything, really?"</p> <p>"I could go out with some girls and go someplace. They all seem pretty good, but you might get in a few fights."</p> <p>"A fight?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, just a lot of yelling and bawling."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't mean like that."</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah. It's okay."</p> <p>"You might just get in a few more fights, and you know it."</p> <p>"You don't have to worry about that."</p> <p>We sat in silence while talking. There really wasn't really anything to say, so I put my hand on top of his.</p> <p>"I don't want to hurt you. You're a really nice guy, and you might be good to keep around."</p> <p>He smiled and gave me a quick hug. "It would be nice actually to stay around and watch you grow up, but I won't. I just hope it all goes well once you decide to move on. The first time I told you that I've been having sex with my best friend is kind of weird, but it's kind of exciting, seeing you have an actual girlfriend. It sounds like it might actually be fun."</p> <p>I was shocked at his enthusiasm as we laughed again at something that should have been said. I've read about men having sex with women and I think it adds to the idea.</p> <p>"Would you mind if I took you somewhere on Friday night?"</p> <p>"A date is a date, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he said in a very thoughtful tone before looking me directly in the eye. I was stunned. I looked away and I'm pretty sure that my face turned a bit red from my embarrassment.</p> <p>"Well, there's no rush... and I don'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
