She'd just been a complete total slut. My cock was so hard it hurt. And I didn't know what she was thinking, but I knew that I was going to fuck her again and again. I wanted to do anything to make this moment happen as I had for months. I was going to make her mine. Her pussy was always mine.</p> <p>The room was filled with the sounds of her moaning. My hand slipped inside the panties for the first time and found the wetness there. With one finger, I slid it in and out while I sucked on her clit. Her legs started to tremble and she cried out again when her first orgasm hit her. Her legs spread wide and she was pushing her pussy onto my fingers even farther. When she finished, she looked down at me with a grin. I smiled back and kissed her. Her mouth was so full I could barely breathe, but there was no escaping from it. There was no going back.</p> <p>"Oh, you're going to make me come again," she moaned.</p> <p>I took her hand and put it on my cock. It was already hard. Her smile became as big as her hips shook. This time, she wanted to say something else to me. "You know," she said softly, "I just couldn't wait to be in bed with you."</p> <p>"I know." I agreed. "I can't think of anything I'd rather do right now than make love to you."</p> <p>"But we should go."</p> <p>I gave her one last kiss and we got up and started to get dressed. "But I want you to come again now, before we leave."</p> <p>"I'd love to," she said. "Let's go."</p> <p>And we did.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p> <p>Lying on the bed, we both had the best sex of our lives. And not just with each other, or even with anyone else. After we got out of the hotel, we had breakfast in the kitchen, then had dinner in the sitting room. The sex we experienced was better than it was, in a lot more ways. And she loved me so much to do that to her.</p> <p>When we were in the car heading back down to the main roads, one of my favorite things to do was to kiss her and caress her breasts while I drove. I loved that I could hold her breasts all the way to town and kiss her nipples, and then work my way slowly down to that area of her body and do the same.</p> <p>We'd finally reached our destination where I'd parked and she got out of the car. It was then she said to me "I don't know if I'm ready for you to take me to bed yet, but I won't be disappointed."</p> <p>"It is your decision," I said, and we went home.</p> <p>Laying in bed after we'd returned to the car, we'd made love the next night. I'd watched her get between her legs and taste the hot juices that soaked into her underwear. I'd felt her soft skin, and listened to my wife as we tried to have the experience with each other.</p> <p>We did a few things that would make us lovers, too. She wanted it on the house, on the sofa, and in the guest bath. We both wanted it in her on the floor in our bedroom. Sometimes she'd make me put my cock where I wanted it, in her mouth, or anywhere else she wanted. She took me to her favorite place. I could hear it and smell it in her bath, and I loved it when she let me enter her there. She'd tell me a lot of times that she was still a virgin, and if I'd ever do that to her, she'd be prepared to let me do it to her. So there was a secret that I'm trying to keep in mind even though I'm sure you already know. But I hope I'm not wrong.</p> <p>I got to do what I always want to do and it gave me a sense of right and wrong. I know it wouldn't have happened but as a consequence, I had no problem doing the things I wanted to do to her. I think my favorite part was when she was on top, doing the doggie-style thing.</p> <p>When she got up to turn onto her stomach at our favorite spot, she lifted up the bottom of her panties. One of her breasts had been in my mouth long enough to tease and tug and play with it. It was only a tease and I was too busy to play with it to pay any mind to her tits. I'd be thinking about them anyway. As I drove by, I'd get into the car and look at her and her pretty face. I'd look at her neck, the rise of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
