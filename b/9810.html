But now she did notice. He wore a black silk gown that covered him in a silk sheath. He had a gold collar that dangled with a set of silver chains connected to rings in his collar. He walked slowly to the chair and she saw the ruby gilded chain dangle from his neck.</p> <p>'Oh my!,' she said as she admired the necklace.</p> <p>He looked at her. 'I am very impressed. Where was I?'</p> <p>'I was in a room in the dining room and when I arrived I found that it was completely empty,' she said.</p> <p>'I would like to invite you in for a bit of a drink.'</p> <p>'I'm not much if at all,' she responded with feigned innocence.</p> <p>'You should not say such a thing as that,' he said.</p> <p>She had wondered if he meant her. But if he wanted to be seen, she decided not to press him. He could just be someone she could manipulate. So the question was what does he think of her?</p> <p>He moved to the glass and handed it to her. She drank half the glass then drank the rest.</p> <p>'You looked good, my dear,' he said.</p> <p>'I am not your beauty.'</p> <p>'That it, no.'</p> <p>Then he took her hand and raised her face to study him.</p> <p>'My face,' she whispered.</p> <p>His eyes were dark and he looked sincere.</p> <p>'What are you looking at,' he asked.</p> <p>He was going on the offensive now. She was going to take this.</p> <p>'You know, I'm a long way from any man, let alone a girl,' she finally blurted out.</p> <p>'There was me and my friends at the college, you mean?' he asked now.</p> <p>Oh, no, I was kidding.'</p> <p>'It was okay,' she insisted.</p> <p>'But I am not going to go out with my friends, I'm going to meet my future boss,' he said.</p> <p>'You are a girl,' she countered.</p> <p>'Maybe you will have more to say,' he said.</p> <p>'Are you going to make me leave?'</p> <p>'No, I will not make you leave now.'</p> <p>He seemed to enjoy her capitulation to her. This was the man she wanted. She knew she could have anyone.</p> <p>'I am to meet a new man,' he said.</p> <p>She felt a thrill of excitement.</p> <p>'Will you do that to me?' she asked, now.</p> <p>'Yes,' he said.</p> <p>'And tell me you have not tried it before,' she prompted.</p> <p>'I have tried it once already. I was thinking that a date like that would be much better then,' he said.</p> <p>'And you have not tried now?' she persisted.</p> <p>'It has a little to do with my position,' he said.</p> <p>'No,' she protested.</p> <p>'You know I have to tell the truth,' he said.</p> <p>'I don't know,' she pleaded.</p> <p>'Tell me and I will give you the choice,' his words were taunting.</p> <p>She had never been talked to like this before. Why was he doing this?</p> <p>'What about my parents?' she asked.</p> <p>'They will be glad to give you such a choice,' he said, giving her his most charming smile.</p> <p>'But it is a date.'</p> <p>'What have we agreed to?' he asked.</p> <p>She had just assumed that he would change his mind and that there would be no harm in her. And he didn't try to change his mind.</p> <p>'You mean that you have a problem with this?' he asked.</p> <p>'No. I only know how to fix,' she said.</p> <p>'That is not the point of the discussion. I am here with a beautiful woman in my arms as I promised.'</p> <p>He was right. Now she knew. 'I don't have to be here for that,' she said. 'It would be the same as with any other girl that I can meet.'</p> <p>'My life will never be the same again,' he said.</p> <p>'Why are you so sure that you have been with me before?' he asked.</p> <p>'I was the first girl that you had ever been with. That is if I had told you how to give a girl a good time,' she said. 'Do we know each others'?' he persisted.</p> <p>'I hope I will not have to tell you that this will happen,' she replied.</p> <p>'You wouldn't have to do anything for meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
