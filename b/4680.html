I'm so confused."</p> <p>"I feel more confused every time I see you," and so did I. It seemed to be a new twist to our relationship; something new about each other. But in the months that passed before I even mentioned it, I didn't want to go through the whole thing again.</p> <p>************</p> <p>It was Thursday night. The band hadn't played for a week, and I hadn't had the time to go over the notes and the songs they released. But the band was back up to kick back to their next show at 8pm on a Thursday; and a good one. I got dressed, and sat alone at home before I made a phone call. As it turned out, Steve went to the bar with his buddy Joe who was the owner.</p> <p>He knew where I was going to be on Friday to have a few more of my own, and knew when to pick me up. Steve and Joe got together during dinner to set up the play list. A couple of drinks were a bit more than I needed to take care of, and my heart was beating faster at one point. As the play got to the end, the band played, and we all sat around having our own drinks for after the show. I felt pretty good and relaxed, but I wasn't really happy. After the other guys left, Joe asked me if I needed to give up on the bar. I felt like we both knew that it wasn't a good idea. I asked him what he meant by it.</p> <p>"Well, we're all in a little buzz right now."</p> <p>I didn't want to give up, so I agreed. He put a hand on my arm, causing me to shiver a bit.</p> <p>"Are you feeling better?"</p> <p>"Yes, I think so. But I'm not sure if I'm even feeling so good after all the guys left."</p> <p>"You can still take a walk with me, if you'd like."</p> <p>"Are you sure that you want to do that? We don't go out, do we?"</p> <p>"I don't want to get in the way of you talking with me while you're having a few drinks."</p> <p>"If I have to carry you off to the car and carry you home, then sure," and with that a kiss on my mouth and a quick trip, I was off.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p> <p>At 1 am on Friday, Joe and I went to the bar. It was 9 and I had been to 2 many times before. I had never been to a bar before and had never been anywhere. It just felt right and right in this quiet, warm night. We went to our usual booth, and ordered a few drinks. The music started and I smiled and started dancing in the small spaces between Joe and me. Joe's hands were on my hips, moving in time with the music and making me all wetter and wetter.</p> <p>We finished, and got our drinks, and I handed Joe his and Joe mine and went back on the couch. I sat back with my legs spread, and said: "Can you get a few more in?"</p> <p>"I have just the thing."</p> <p>The band came on, the first set was fairly slow, but Joe was having fun talking. I just sat there and listened to the sound, feeling like I was the only person in the world. After the show, I went home, showered, brushed my teeth, then got out of bed. I got in my car, and just drove home, and went to the bar. I asked a few men where I could meet them, then got a guy that was on his way home. I told him I wasn't in town and could use a little time. As it turned out, I took him home, and he fucked me as I sucked every single thing I could pull out of his pants. Just as he was about to blow his load, he had one of the most powerful orgasms that I'd ever experienced, and I swallowed everything that he had to offer, and we kissed passionately.</p> <p>Once he got in his truck, I asked if he wanted to come home. Joe agreed, so I pulled us apart, and we got in my car. I took him home after kissing him goodnight, then I took Joe to the restaurant for dinner. There we took the last set of the set, and then I had to leave early.
