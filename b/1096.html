Her face and neck were pink and I could see the tension in her neck. She was biting her lower lip, trying to keep it together. My cock, which was at full mast, sprang in her face and she immediately grabbed it, stroking me slowly. Her mouth was suddenly agape, lips so wet I could feel them glisten with her saliva as I thrust against her mouth. She pushed her fingers up and down my cock, feeling the veins bulging on the sides and beginning to throb. I could see her face, flush, cheeks flushed. Her voice was little more than a whisper, barely audible over her breathing.</p> <p>"I want you. I can't wait anymore."</p> <p>In that moment, I didn't want her to stop. I needed to cum. I pushed her face back into me again and lifted her chin with my index finger. Her mouth still open, her eyes still locked on mine, I slid my fingers down and began to rub the tip of my cock along the edge of her lips. It was a brief, awkward contact, the touch so soft and gentle, but not really unpleasant.</p> <p>She grabbed at her hair again and I pulled her face down towards me, so I could lean down again. And with a few more strokes, I slid into her mouth, almost all the way. Her throat clenched and undulated as she tried to take me all in. I watched my cock as she let loose the most amazing, throaty sound I had felt since she and Brian broke up. She began a rhythmic, smooth rhythmic motion with her mouth. I grabbed the front of her shoulders, her elbows and pulled her onto me. She began to grind against my pelvis as our hips met. I started to thrust in and out of her, slowly, allowing her the room I needed to hold back. Her cheeks sunk again, but this time her tongue was not at my end.</p> <p>"Fuck. Just fuck me. Right now."</p> <p>I was trying not to moan, but could feel the sound of my own breathing. She was doing this so well. I couldn't believe how turned on I was at the mere idea of being deep inside of her. She was moving so perfectly with me. I grabbed her hair again, and ran it through my fingers, making her moan. We both began to lose the rhythm of our motions, we began to move more quickly into each other, she against me, I against her. Her breath in my ear, my skin against hers. She was biting her lip, and I could feel her tongue, and the lightness of her breath against mine, each of us now feeling the other for the first time. Our lips were on the other, I could feel our tongues trying to play each other out. I felt her breasts press against my thigh, I could feel the top of her dress pressed between my legs and feel the slight contact of her hard nipples on my skin. I could smell her now. Something warm and slightly sweet, a fresh and sweet scent. I didn't care. I wanted her.</p> <p>I finally pushed back, forcing my full length into her mouth. I could feel the vibrations of her wet tongue against me and it sent waves of pleasure up and down my shaft. Suddenly, she stopped, letting me pull from her lips and her grip on my cock slack.</p> <p>I could feel it on my balls, the tip of my cock was throbbing and it made me feel so sexy. I looked down at her, but couldn't see anything, I knew she was looking at me.</p> <p>I looked up at her.</p> <p>"I want you to get on your hands and knees. I want to fuck you. Please."</p> <p>She just looked a little shocked.</p> <p>"Get up on your knees."</p> <p>"Now move."</p> <p>She complied with my command, and I slid back against the wall. She began to do so, but I stopped her and led her to get on the floor. She was so petite that I could feel her tremble on the edge of the wall. I knelt behind her and slid my hands around her, I slipped a finger under her, and began to thrust. She moaned and leaned back, allowing me easier access to her warm pussy. I ran my hands up her stomach, her bra line, to her breasts, and felt the weight of them in my palms. I played with her nipples, rubbing them in the soft fabric of her bra, I wanted to feel those soft breasts in my hands. I could feel her body vibrate from my touch. She began to shake and her arms began to twitch, they were trembling so much and so fast.</p> <p>"Stop. Please."</p> <p>I stopped, but her trembling had ceased. "Turn over."</p> <p>I was almost disappointedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
