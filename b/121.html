She asks as she takes my hand. "I want to do that! I can't get pregnant!"</p> <p>"It is a big step," I agree quickly. "I don't really care if the guy thinks he is a priest of love who only he can have sex with you? It is only a matter of time. If there is no man who will love you and respect you or respect you and respect you; well, I might as well take on the first one for sure, but I will need to talk with your mother about her. She would be a mess if her baby didn't like her."</p> <p>I shake off everything around me. I am confused. I didn't know that this guy was my mom's biological father! This guy would have to be the father of my mother. That thought is almost enough to make me shudder.</p> <p>As I try to come to terms with it, I realize that my heart is beating out of my chest. I have not felt it in years. I'm sweating and aching for a baby. I don't know what to do. I have just been told that my life was completely over.</p> <p>At the same time, the idea of a baby is too daunting. I have never had a female that I wanted to have sex with. I just didn't know that I could be that good. But on a deeper level, we are both having sex. If mommy could give birth, I could give birth to my own baby. If I was not the father of this guy, then it wasn't a choice at all. What was I going to do? It was the only way I could think of to end this.</p> <p>I start to realize that if mommy could give birth then I'm at least a daddy. I think that if she could give birth to my own baby, I would have to go to the church. She would probably be married to the boy I would love, but the fact that I was a father also meant that it would be just the way it was supposed to be, or else she wouldn't want to do it. I think I have to stop thinking so clearly again.</p> <p>The question is, would this man be my father? I have never had the father of a child in my life. There was only the mother, and she always wanted to be a mother. I think the possibility of having a baby was never considered when it was just the two of us. I am not exactly looking forward to having a baby with my own man, but I know if I can give him a child and then raise him like his grandma, that it is going to be just like a baby. I am determined that we will have a baby together, and then we can have a real life together. I can feel my body betray me at what I feel.</p> <p>I get off the phone and take a step toward the bedroom door. The idea is to walk out with our clothes on and that we can put that little problem of love in the past. I cannot just stay in here. Now, just go out with your mom, and we'll come to a solution together. After all, I was just doing my job and I did what I thought was right.</p> <p>I don't know what to think. I have come to this conclusion a million times. I don't understand. I am afraid that this may be the only solution. I haven't been sexually satisfied for a while now and in the last five months, nothing has changed.</p> <p>I make my way out to the living room and sit down on the couch. I feel my body tremble and fear. Here I am, dressed as a man who is ready to marry his own wife, my own dad, my own big family.</p> <p>I guess I will be the last wife on the planet. What a shame. Why couldn't everyone have lived this way before? It is about time people realized that this was a mistake of the past.</p> <p>I go to the refrigerator, take out a cup and put a few cold dishes in it. The microwave has to be switched off because the dish washing machine is on the far wall. I figure I will take my food, water, lunch, and a couple of cups and start off with the dishes. Now that I am feeling good, I can stop and think again. Who should I marry? Mom has always been everything. She is the queen of the world. I don't know if I ever will get my wish.</p> <p>I walk back into the bedroom and go through the closet trying to find anything I can use for a wedding dress. I am still feeling the fear of being rejected by my mother. There are a million things in the closet that just don't fit the way I want to be in my life. I guess I am going to start with mommy.</p> <p>Theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
