It was hard to believe that they'd only had sex once before and not seen one thing more amazing in their life. After the toast, Lisa was a different person. She had no guilt or shame about what she'd been doing at home; it was her own passion, her own desires that had brought it to a close. This new version of her had taken away the guilt all together. She was no longer the "other" woman that had always made her orgasm and not any longer the "one-time" lover that she had always made her feel. It was easy for her not to feel guilty, guilt would have to be replaced by love, and that love was as beautiful a thing as it was a pain and needed to be filled, as often as possible.</p> <p>The guys at the table were staring at the girls with hunger and desire on their faces, and were talking at one end of the conversation.

We are so excited that you enjoyed our time together so much!"</p> <p>"What can I say, we like it," the guys said, all eyes on their girlfriends.

Their first session was spent in the shower. They got on the bed, they were kissing and caressing. The guys started getting hard again, and within a minute, they could go. All three of them climaxed at the same time.</p> <p>After dinner, the guys said their goodbyes.</p> <p>"We'll be in touch sometime tomorrow. Tell our wives that we enjoyed our stay together again, and we want to see each other again some time when you two are at the end of your marriage," one asked. Of course, they would be in good shape to get physical again, but it was a good idea, that way all the other stuff would be taken care of. It was still kind of a fantasy to say goodbye to her, but to them it was a promise.</p> <p>Then the girls went to their bedroom where they undressed and jumped into the shower together again. Later they showered together and were in the same shapeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
