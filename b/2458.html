He said quietly. It took him a long time to think about it, but he finally did.</p> <p>He knew from experience that he had a life and he was proud that he had found a good one.</p> <p>He started wondering when he would get back to his life and find out what everyone said about love and how good it could be. Bill decided to tell someone. He had a very good idea of what he was going to tell Julie and then let him go back to making plans for future encounters.</p> <p>Julie had been very happy with things that week and the new experiences they had brought her all of the way back to her old life. She had been very happy and it showed.</p> <p>"I'll call you later," she said to Bill's still formulating thoughts.</p> <p>He leaned over the table with his head on Julie's shoulder and kissed her softly on the cheek.</p> <p>"I'll look forward to it," he said to himself, trying to find his way back to some sort of happiness.</p> <p>"I need a beer, sweetheart." He said to her. "Be a good girl and come back to my house after your shift."</p> <p>He smiled contentedly at what he had just said to her and then quickly walked out of the kitchen.</p> <p>The next day Bill was doing some cleaning around Julie's condo when an extremely attractive woman with very short brown hair stepped out of the front door. Julie looked up at her as something was going on and gave her a very quick hug before returning to her work. She was wearing a knee-length sundress that flowed like a pair of cotton stockings.</p> <p>Julie had been dressed up for school the day before and she had gone for a visit with her girlfriend after she had gone to her parents' and would have gone on a picnic on the beach with an old friend. When they got back to their house they walked over to the house and she asked Julie if she wanted to come in with her to her parent's after school.</p> <p>Julie agreed and sat down at the table with Bill. They were all quiet for a few minutes before Julie spoke up</p> <p>"It looks like Julie is going for another trip to the beach tomorrow and if you'd like to accompany her on her trip, I'd like to do something for you."</p> <p>"I'd love that," Bill said. "I just don't have anything available right now."</p> <p>"Well, I'm going to come with you. Just you and I. I like talking to you and I don't see anything else you'd rather than talk to the pretty girls in school. So, are you coming with me or not?" Julie giggled. "I'm sure you'll find something a little fun for you too."</p> <p>"I guess it's a bet." Bill replied. "I'm definitely coming with you to the beach tomorrow..."</p> <p>"See ya in a few days dear," Julie replied. She had the foresight to make sure that the outfit she was wearing this morning was perfectly applied to her and her lover.</p> <p>Julie made sure to add a button or three at the bottom of her dress to her outfit and she was glad to see Bill was enjoying himself.</p> <p>"By the way, do you mind if I change into something other than my panties?"</p> <p>Julie smiled at Bill and said, "Be my guest."</p> <p>"Thank you dear." Bill replied and then went to the bathroom.</p> <p>Julie decided to leave the door ajar as she got out into the hallway.</p> <p>She was surprised to find the apartment in a very clean and neat manner. It was just that Bill and Julie went to their separate bedrooms several times over the course of the semester. They had gotten pretty good at making a mess of the place and one can do that without worrying about getting caught.</p> <p>She decided it would be a perfect time to change into her favorite new outfit and just go to the beach tomorrow. They had been pretty successful at finding things to do and the way they had been with the kids. She wasn't sure it would be a good idea to wear this new outfit out in public but the idea also had to stay in place.</p> <p>Julie slipped on the dress and checked herself out in the hallway mirror before she went to the bathroom. Bill was in the bathroom brushing his teeth when she came into the hallway.</p> <p>Julie smiled to herself whenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
