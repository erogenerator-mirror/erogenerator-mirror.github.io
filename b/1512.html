She was still wearing a bra. "Where's mine?"</p> <p>"Sid, you're back early," said Mike.</p> <p>She looked up, catching him, and smiling, said, "How did you get my number off?"</p> <p>"Just in time, you'll see," he said, standing up and approaching her, pressing her body against the couch and then bending forward.</p> <p>"You want to kiss me?" she said, turning her head and kissing him deeply.</p> <p>"Do I?" he countered, kissing her again.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, looking surprised. "I have never kissed anyone except my husband. Now kiss me."</p> <p>They kissed while they kept touching, and they were still touching when she felt the tip of his cock under her skirt, and a moment later, her panties were on the arm of the couch. He lifted her skirt so he could see the crotch of her panties. They went into the bedroom and he had her turn around slowly, and slid her panties down and off of her with just the button of his shirt still on. She kicked her panties away with her feet, leaving her completely naked.</p> <p>She kissed him more, and he reached around her to play with her breasts, then leaned forward to cup her pussy, and she moaned. He slid his fingers between her legs and up again toward the top of her lips. He rubbed her cunt through her panties, making her even more aroused. He got her to lay backward and then she raised her leg over his so her foot was over his. She had to be able to kiss him if she wanted, so she didn't say anything. She just did it with his cock in her mouth. Then they began to make out again, and she knew what that meant. She wasn't sure if she wanted him to do that with her when she climaxed or if she did it with him. She'd told him that she'd never tell him that.</p> <p>He put both his hands on her tits and squeezed them gently, as if he was trying to push them together. She didn't mind. She was glad when she felt his cock begin to stiffen in her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, Sam, I love this," said Mike. He pushed his body close to her and kissed her again, pulling aside her bra to allow his tongue to touch her mouth.</p> <p>Mike's hand slid into her panties and he felt the wetness of her slit, already swollen and wanting to be kissed. She moaned again as his finger moved up and down her slit, teasing her. Then Mike kissed her again. She could make out his tongue pushing into her mouth with his. He kept kissing her more and fingering her, driving her mad with desire. She loved being kissed by him and he was a good lover to kiss, but there was something else that drove her wild every time she would give in. He would suck her tongue until she was ready to surrender fully to his passionate kiss. Then again he would kiss her mouth, her ear, her neck, her breast, until she was completely spent.</p> <p>After a while she felt his cock harden again against her mouth. She wanted him inside her, but she liked being with him and she didn't want to lose her virginity. She didn't want to lose her virginity by letting him fuck her and it seemed to be what she wanted. Instead, she let him slide his finger into her until he felt all the way up her slippery slit, then he did the same. He slid his finger in and out of her, stroked her clit with his thumb and pushed his finger deeper inside her as he kissed her again, his tongue pushing her further towards climax. She felt her body shudder and she didn't care if it scared her as much as it pleased him.</p> <p>"Mike!" she yelled out. "I want you inside me!"</p> <p>"Honey, don't worry," he replied, slipping both his hands along the outside of her panties. "If you want me to stop, just say the word and I'll stop."</p> <p>"Oh, god, Mike, that's marvelous."</p> <p>She kissed him deeper, feeling his tongue press against her, and pressing her lips to his mouth as she said, "I will never stop, and I never quit."</p> <p>"Do you want me to go?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, do it!" she said, her eyes bright and pleading, her voice a bit strained.</p> <p>He slid his hands up under her panties and cupped her naked breasts, teasing her nipples to get them hard.</p> <p>"Now, what I want is what I've wanted since I met you," he said.
