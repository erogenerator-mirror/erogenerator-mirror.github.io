"Now I don't have that," he whispered in my ear and then took off, not bothering to get dressed for fear he would wake him up and say the same thing the next morning. "Let's go get a coffee," my husband called down. His voice had that same little laugh.</p> <p>I pulled away from our embrace and looked straight at him. The look was like a little kid as he gave a little nod. "I'm going over to the bathroom, my mom will be out. You two have fun," and I shut the door and closed it behind me.</p> <p>As I went down the hallway to get some coffee he stood up, "Oh no you don't," he said laughing as I passed him on the way out. "I'm still getting my coffee, come and sit and let me get some," he suggested to me as he took in my body through the door to the master bedroom.</p> <p>"No thank you thank you," I said with a smile on my face as walked to the bed and lay down. I was wearing a long t-shirt that was very tight in the front and came to just below an inch or two below my nipples.</p> <p>He joined me after pouring coffee and we sat there listening to the sounds of the shower running. We were both completely in our own world. As I drank, the silence in the room was filled with the sound of the water flowing off the shower head.</p> <p>"Oh my god," I moaned as I felt a finger slide up my thigh until it was touching the top of my mound. He whispered in my ear. And I moaned again as his finger slid back toward the top of my pussy. I let out a gasp as I felt his finger tip begin to stroke my moistening outer lips. He kissed my cheek as his finger parted the top of my pussy with the movement of its finger tip. I lifted my hips from the bed so I could feel his finger slip inside me as it started to massage my clit and lips. I held on to him for dear life as he continued to tease me as the water continued to flow.</p> <p>"Oh, God..." I said as his finger slipped inside my hot wetness. I felt my juices flood across his fingers as he began to finger me faster. My body began to move as my orgasm built. I had never experienced anything like this. When I felt he hand begin to move off of my leg, I let out a short shriek. The feeling was too much for me to take and I shot my second orgasm from his fingers hitting my G- Spot and my entire body shook with it.</p> <p>He leaned up and kissed me as I lay on my back in the middle of the bed. "Oh, did you like it?" he asked as he kissed my neck. The smile on his face was a mixture of passion and desire as his lips slid down my chest to my nipple. As he moved away I felt the tip of his cock press against the entrance to my pussy.</p> <p>"Take your shirt off," he said as he slid his cock into me. I watched in amazement as his hard cock disappeared inside my pussy in one strong push. "Oh yeah," I exclaimed as he pushed my shirt up over my head. His hard cock began to move more easily deep inside of me as he slid his cock in deeper than either of us ever had.</p> <p>"I'm gonna fuck you until you beg me to stop," I said in a whisper. He had to stop because his cock felt so good and my body seemed to go on forever as it moved inside of me. His fingers were still on my nipple as his cock slammed into me. I felt his body begin to shake from the way I was shaking and he began to spasm inside of me and began to empty himself on my pussy. I felt his cum squirt into me one last time as I heard him gasping as his body went weak.</p> <p>I looked into his eyes as we both lay there.</p> <p>"My baby loved it," he whispered into my ear.</p> <p>I had never heard him say those words to me before. I had told him before that I wanted his cock in me when we had been together.</p> <p>I was totally exhausted after that wonderful bout of sex. After he had left, I pulled on a pair of panties and a robe and walked down to the kitchen to make sure Mom was still in town.</p> <p>She still lived down the road at the time, and while she still had to get her car fixed, it did make sense if she called in a cab or if we went to town. I could stay home this weekend if I got a chance to get to know her and she probably wouldn't call in so much.</p> <p>It was not that I needed to get my husband anything. I didn't really know what to think about being with her allâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
