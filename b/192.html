Hey, honey, where's mom? What time is it?" I said.</p> <p>She got up and went into the kitchen, then came to where I was sitting, and sat down on the couch facing me.</p> <p>"Honey, we need to talk, about something. You don't have to think about anything right now," she said, but I could see the anger and hurt clearly there.</p> <p>So I sat there dumb-struck.</p> <p>"Listen, baby. We can talk later, just take the time. And we will be alright, ok? We are together, now. And we both know it. And...and we both want things, for each other," her voice quavered, sounding almost angry. It didn't help that her dress was tight and riding up high on her big titties and she had her legs crossed tightly. She looked like a little girl with her hand in the cookie jar. Her legs were long and thin and those thighs were huge.</p> <p>I couldn't believe my mother was actually angry and not my Uncle Ed. But if she had been, she didn't say anything, did she?</p> <p>"Come on let's try not to be mad again. Let's just talk. We have to make things better, so we can make it better for us."</p> <p>And she did tell me to take the time to talk. Just let me have the time to ask her to talk and find out what happened to us. I had seen that look on her face in the past few months, when I had seen her, when I had heard that she had been hurt. But the truth was I had wondered about it, and it had taken a bit of time to finally come out. I'd always assumed I could just lie and be a smart asshole but my mother was a lot smarter, maybe more complex than I thought, maybe she could be smarter, but she wasn't, just like I was.</p> <p>So I let my mother take the time to talk, but I could sense her, and at first I was afraid she didn't even realize it, and then she looked down and laughed at me.</p> <p>"Oh look, he said he's awake. You're up!" her voice carried. I looked down at where I was sitting. She was still on the couch, but she had moved up to it so that it was level with her big titties. "Come here."</p> <p>I looked down at the big titties and my mind started to go blank. Suddenly I realized they were huge.</p> <p>"Oh my god, you are huge!" I couldn't breathe. My arms almost felt numb. But it was so hard to do. I felt my face heat up, but I just couldn't breathe.</p> <p>"It's ok, baby. Just relax, let it go easy and you'll forget about everything," mom said. But as I said before, I'd been in my teenage years and knew just a bit about sex, but just not with my sister. At least that's what I read on the internet. "But for now, maybe you'd like a little more," she said. I started to object.</p> <p>"No, no. Let's just talk for now. We need to get this out of the way, you know. We're only going to talk about it if you'll just listen to everything I've said. OK?" she emphasized the 'k' in the middle and said, "If this sounds strange to you, you can just drop it. But listen, and just talk this over with me. Just listen." And with that I felt her hand touch my arm. "But I might even let you put your hand on me," she said. I felt like I was on some kind of roller coaster, and my thoughts were racing, going crazy, and my vision flashed and my head swam. I looked down and saw my hand on my mother's big boob. And she was smiling a little, but not in the way I could mistake for anger or anger, but in the kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind that I knew was supposed to be reserved for family and friends. Somehow, it seemed like she knew and respected me better than I knew her and that I would just come out of the blue, but then she said, "Come on, honey. I'll show you." and she lifted up her tittie from her chest and gave me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>I'd seen this kind of thing before, and I figured, what the hell, and just get up out of the chair right now and make the first move. I started to get up, but mom put her hand on my shoulder. She leaned over and kissed me on the cheek, and as soon as she did that, she reached down and put her hand on top of mineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
