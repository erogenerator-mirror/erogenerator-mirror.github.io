I really didn't want to have to admit it to anyone. But I couldn't. I couldn't go into the bedroom and make that declaration to Mary. It would ruin everything, and so what if.</p> <p>"You're still looking so damn good today, little man. You were on your way when I came running," she remarked. I just looked around the room to see if they were all gone. No one was in sight. We'd been in there for a while, and they were still in the bedroom.</p> <p>"I didn't know you were back yet," I stated.</p> <p>"Me either, but I had to have something to eat, that's why I came. Oh, and by the way, is there a name that your wife would like to name you?"</p> <p>"You'd like it, honey. This sounds so sweet, but who would it be?"</p> <p>"It must be that cute dog?"</p> <p>"Oh, no. She didn't look very happy in my opinion."</p> <p>"Honey, I don't think you know dogs. They only come here to go dog shopping, not to play. And what I saw this afternoon with my friends really turned me on. I'm glad I'm not your dog, but it would be more fun if I was. I love the way you look so... you know, in pig-tails, when you're doing a pig-tail thing or something. I loved watching them walk by, and how I thought they'd look at each other."</p> <p>'And how did you come to like them, when you were watching other dogs like me?' I wondered.</p> <p>After a minute of this, Mary interrupted, "I'm just so happy that you came today. And he looks happy too."</p> <p>"I didn't think he'd want me to let him out of that cage so you could have a dog."</p> <p>She giggled at that, "Oh dear. He wants me so much that he's got a cock. I don't mind."</p> <p>"You're a bitch, Mommy," I admonished her.</p> <p>"I don't even really mind what your cock looks like," she admitted. "And my pussy really loves to like seeing a nice, thick cock coming out of a hairy one."</p> <p>"That's a good thing about the cage," I reminded her.</p> <p>"You really like it, don't you? You'll do anything for it," she asked.</p> <p>"So long as you let me out. I'll let you out of any and all cages, and the sooner the better." "I would do anything for it, I'm a big girl, why should you think that a little little cock won't feel good. You love to watch me getting a piece of that cock."</p> <p>"Oh, don't you worry my big girl, you're not getting out," she laughed. "Besides, it's not fair. You can watch me take him out and put him in my pussy. Then you can give him a chance to get off like I did the other day."</p> <p>"And do what, honey?"</p> <p>"I was thinking of you," she answered as if she'd seen enough horror movie.</p> <p>"So I got out, and watched you walk up and get a dog. Or do you still remember that story, if you want to tell it."</p> <p>Mary giggled again, "I forgot about it. Why do you always want to tell the details?"</p> <p>"Nothing really. Actually, I'm having fun teasing you with it. You've got a great idea."</p> <p>"Oh! Well, you got me at a real tease with that dog. I just wanted to bring it out and put it in the cage..."</p> <p>"No, no. That would be a shame." As I watched her thinking, she added, "I love your tongue. So long and so long." "We have that in common."</p> <p>"I know. I love how it's fun and all, but I don't think I can just be your lover."</p> <p>"How long, I wonder?" I responded.</p> <p>"Oh, five months. I like that too, but still." She sounded so unsure, I was worried.</p> <p>"Mary, it takes some finding out," I teased.</p> <p>"So, how does your little dog get in a cage? You know that we're not going to have sex, right?"</p> <p>I smiled, "Well, maybe a little. I was sure you'd love it better if you were a little more open minded."</p> <p>She smiled back, "I told you, my pussy does not care if anyone sees us. It's just there so... let's move to the end."</p> <p>"Ok.
