"Do you know a whole neighborhood off-base down the road?"</p> <p>"No. My grandparents lived about fifty minutes away but they're nowhere to be seen," I said.</p> <p>We parked my car in front of the old home, got out and walked over to the front entrance.</p> <p>"What exactly happened to the place?" she asked, stopping. "Where are you going?"</p> <p>"I'll explain later," I said. We stood there staring out into the night. It looked like any other night on any of the town's streets. We reached my place and she kissed me all over my face and neck, slowly and gently kissing me on the lips. I opened my mouth and let her tongue in.</p> <p>"So here we are. I love this place."</p> <p>She took two steps forward and kissed me with a little more passion, pushing her tongue into my mouth. I opened my mouth and let hers in. I broke away as soon as our lips met. It seemed like we were both just starting to get used to the feeling of each other. My heart went into overdrive again. I didn't know when we'd get back to her place.</p> <p>"Why don't we see what we can do to get home to rest for a while," she said. "There's a fire pit I like to work in."</p> <p>We found a couple of spots in the trees around the pit and went over to it and sat in it, kissing and touching, kissing and touching. After a few minutes of this, we stood up. I pulled her face down and kissed her again. I reached behind her and undid her slacks. She wore no underwear.</p> <p>"I want you to go take a shower," she said, and led me back her by the hand. "There's no bathroom here," I said, pushing into the water and enjoying the water of the shower on my body.</p> <p>We kissed once again. I stood behind her, my arms around her. She reached between us and took me into the deepest of her pussy. I held the back of her head as she kissed my neck. I wrapped my arms around her and held her as she kissed my body all over.</p> <p>"How does it feel to have a woman hold you for me, my lover?" she asked her voice soft. We both held onto each other, the soap making the contact so gentle and sensuous. Her nipples were still hard and I could see her areolas through the water. I could feel her pulse through her body with me here.</p> <p>"It feels very good. You are special."</p> <p>"You really know how to touch me," she said, looking up. She kissed my face and chest and then kissed my lips. It was a long kiss. For a moment, I thought I'd never leave her. She held me by the shoulders and held me in her arms.</p> <p>"Let's go to my room," she said as she slowly led me up the hill. "You can get undressed."</p> <p>She took off her jacket and we stood there. She let go of me and unbuttoned her blouse. I undid my own buttons and took off my shirt. She let it slide off of me and we stood there, looking at each other. I reached around behind her and unzipped and took off her bra.</p> <p>"My breasts are so round and firm," I said.</p> <p>She reached up and took her nipples and pulled them between our fingers, squeezing them gently. We touched our faces. I put my hand in the front of her panties, feeling her soft flesh and finding her pubic hair. I pulled up and she pushed her panties off, my fingers sliding along her wet slit. It did not take long for our mouths to meet once more.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes, I pulled her back into the shower with me, and she wrapped her arms around me, feeling every inch of my body. She kissed me again, letting me get the soap again and then took my hands and slowly pushed them between her legs. I took them slowly, massaging her labia and clit. She moaned and ground her body into mine, feeling me against her.</p> <p>The kissing, the feeling of us against each other just continued as we continued to touch each other. I was still hard, and I could feel her body, the hot and soft flesh of her breasts and pubic hair against my groin.</p> <p>She held me and let go.</p> <p>"You know what," she said. "Come here and let me wash you." "I'd like to wash you too," I said</p> <p>We kissed again, our bodies moving together. I felt her breasts in her hands, feeling the softness of her skin under my fingers. I felt her lips around my erectionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
