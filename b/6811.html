She giggled. "Would...wouldn't you be happy to have the opportunity to meet me sometime if I could just get to know you the way you were the other day."</p> <p>"Well, you are too sweet for my first day. It's been a while."</p> <p>She reached out and touched his cheek.</p> <p>"It's been a while?"</p> <p>He smiled. "Oh, yeah. You were all over my ass again this morning, and after I fucked you yesterday. I wanted to really use you."</p> <p>"Well then...you're gonna get it then." She grinned and leaned against his chest. "That's what you had in mind when you called me last night, isn't it?"</p> <p>He smiled. "Yeah, that's it that's all you have in mind."</p> <p>"Don't be such a prude." She said playfully.</p> <p>It was an odd thought, but they were both adults, and maybe if she was willing, they could try to make it through the night after one of their orgasms.</p> <p>Just then she got up and walked towards her bedroom. As she did, she leaned over and kissed him. That was a wonderful idea. It gave her and him the chance to share the moment. And she was ready for him to ravish her again.</p> <p>She felt her heart skip a beat as she went into her room. It had been so long, and she just knew she was never going to see him again. She turned and looked over her shoulder. Her heart was pounding in her chest. She wasn't sure how she was going to keep her hands off of him in their mutual desire. Or if they were going to sleep together.</p> <p>But then she heard his door close, and the sound of his car starting the driveway. He was taking a leisurely shower that he usually did at night, so she had something planned for tomorrow to help her enjoy this new adventure.</p> <p>She lay there for a while, wondering what he might do when he got out of the shower. It seemed so much more intimate. She wondered if he'd even let her go naked, or if he simply wanted to see her. Her husband loved to see her naked, and he loved to see her have her way with other men. But it wasn't her husband that she really wanted. She just hoped no one she had ever met would know that she'd been getting "fucked" or "by" another woman.</p> <p>A little later, she heard him get out of bed. He was fully clothed, and she got up and followed him.</p> <p>"I thought you wanted me to tell you that you were going to be here tomorrow." she said as she followed him into his bedroom.</p> <p>"I did. I wanted to tell you before. I was hoping that you would make the first move. I guess I didn't think you'd really notice, but...I don't know." He said with a grin, "Well, I'm glad you finally had the chance. It has been a while."</p> <p>He paused a moment just before they entered his bedroom. He looked at her for a moment, then smiled. "That I get. Do you like how I dress for the night? I try to give you the best show possible."</p> <p>She felt herself blush, and felt her insides tighten. It had been so long since she had felt her body go up and down, and as she was being lowered down onto her back, she was feeling a bit light-headed.</p> <p>"I think I can feel it." she said as she ran her hands all over his chest.</p> <p>"You're right. That makes it all the better for me. But you know, just let loose and it will only be for an hour or two...or maybe two times at most." He turned and kissed her neck. "And...if you do get turned on again, maybe we can do something. I've been wondering what it would feel like, if you did the same thing, if you were going to be my first."</p> <p>She felt her insides quiver again as he told her that. And then he was on his knees, and taking her arms in his hands. She had to lean up against him for support.</p> <p>And then they were both naked on the bed. And then he was climbing between her legs, teasing her a bit.</p> <p>This was his favorite part. He loved to take charge and make sure she was comfortable. He was going to take the lead, and make her feel good. She knew what thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
