She smiled and kissed the top of my head, then her tongue came out to lick circles around my ear. She smiled again and ran her lips down my neck and to my chest. Just as she pulled away for a moment, she was back to that sweet spot, teasing the skin with her tongue.</p> <p>I grabbed her wrist, and pushed her down further, my cock in one hand and her leg on the edge of my lap with the other. I guided her into the center of the bed, and told her to straddle my legs.</p> <p>"Do you want to be inside me now?" she asked. I nodded. "I'm a little bit apprehensive," she said. She moved into position. I raised my right hand.</p> <p>"Spread your legs." She followed my instructions; after several seconds, my finger entered her wet and willing pussy. I put pressure on her G-spot, and she shivered and bit my neck, moaning like a small kitten.</p> <p>As quickly as it had happened, I got up and picked up some lube. I pushed my cock against her pussy lips, and pressed it in, slowly, deliberately. She was shaking and moaning; her head was moving from side to side. I felt her move her hips as if she was trying to ride me. I didn't make any motion.</p> <p>"Let go of it," I said, and she did.</p> <p>She came down slowly, but started moving up and down a little faster.</p> <p>"Do you need to stop again?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she moaned. "I want you on top of me." She looked over my shoulder at the clock and looked at me.</p> <p>"I don't want to cum in the missionary position. I just want you on top of me, with your weight on top of me."</p> <p>She moved her hips up and down as much as she could do without hurting the mattress. My eyes looked across the bed; there were a couple of the few people sitting with a glass of wine in front of them looking at all of us.</p> <p>I pulled myself up off of her so that I could get the tip of my cock into her. She pulled herself up to her knees, then took that wonderful cock in her right hand and pointed it right at her opening.</p> <p>My cock was like a little piston in her pussy; it was like her pussy had never been stretched before. I took my hand and put the hand directly on her clit. I kept going, getting harder and harder as I stroked in and out. "Don't take no for an answer. Just fuck me."</p> <p>She looked at me in the mirror. "Harder, harder," she whimpered. "Oh, don't stop." My hand was in constant motion in her pussy, and my fingers were rubbing her G-spot.</p> <p>Her hips were bucking and bucking in little circles as she went up and down my rod like a woman possessed. We were both breathing hard and moaning and screaming. "I'm cumming," she cried out. "I'm cumming!" Her body shook as my cock exploded inside of her. We all fell back on the bed and lay there, spent; her nipples were still very sensitive.</p> <p>"Wow!" was all she managed to utter.</p> <p>"You liked that?" I asked. She nodded.</p> <p>"Are you ready to fuck me now?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, as if I couldn't believe how great a lay it was.</p> <p>She grabbed my cock and guided it towards her clit. I moved forward, and she gasped as I entered her. We were both so much shorter than I thought it would be possible to fit into her. I began to enter her again as she looked around at the people around us. She looked up at me from the floor and smiled. "Your pussy feels good," she said.</p> <p>"You're so big," I heard someone say, looking around. I was sure that they were looking at us. I pushed back in, and she gasped again. I pulled out, and pushed in faster and faster, faster and faster. Finally we were slamming into each other in our own rhythm, moaning and screaming. I held onto her tits tightly with both my hands, and we were both screaming with excitement as our orgasms hit simultaneously.</p> <p>My body was trembling, and I was so hot that I was sweating. We were both shaking as our passions ran wild. When her legs gave out from under her I pulled my cock from her. She gasped, and her pussy spasmed and shook some more.</p> <p>I pulled my cock out from between her legs and laid it on her stomach.
