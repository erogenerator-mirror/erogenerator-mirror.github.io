Fuck me hard. Don't make me come."</p> <p>She arched her back and spread her legs even wider. She threw a leg over me and grabbed the back of my neck and started bouncing up and down on me.</p> <p>"I'm cumming. Fuck. Fuuuuck. FUUuuuuuuuuuuuuuck."</p> <p>As soon as I felt that familiar stirring up in me again, I gave my best shot and shot my load into her.</p> <p>After my final spasms faded down and she came down from her peak of pleasure, I just laid there, spent but still inside her. "Was that good. Did you come again while I was kissing you?"</p> <p>"Yeah... it was intense,"</p> <p>"Was it good for you?"</p> <p>"Yeah... It was amazing."</p> <p>As soon as she said that, she kissed me again. This time she put her head on my shoulder and rested her hand on my chest. Her other hand was still on my cock, stroking it slowly back to full mast. She was still in her own world of euphoria.</p> <p>Just when she began to come back to normal once I was out of her, I heard, "I need to go. Thank you."</p> <p>"Uh... you didn't have to thank me."</p> <p>"I should go," she said, smiling, "but I think I might wanna make it up to you."</p> <p>"We'd better get up before somebody accidentally sees us."</p> <p>"We'll never do that," she said. "We're friends."</p> <p>"You need to get dressed. Our time is up, and it's late..." I suggested.</p> <p>"I'm going to go check on the boys. I'll see you the following Saturday. Love you."</p> <p>"Love you too," she said. She smiled at me and kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>When she got up and left, I thought I would still be hard, but not yet. I could feel the cum slowly slumping from my cock and down my leg. I couldn't believe that this was my best friend, naked, in the nude. And we had just engaged in sex. Maybe that's it. I thought maybe it was just the lust and a little awkwardness, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it was an innocent moment. Maybe we had just made out. Maybe this is just something to do... it's not like I really knew her at all in that way. But I enjoyed being with her. I liked being with her, and I loved being with her.</p> <p>That evening I sat on the couch watching a comedy show but I was really bored. My favorite show was, "What's Going on in Heaven?" As I was watching it, I noticed the two other guys sitting next to each other. They had an interesting discussion, and I noticed that one pair of legs were up almost all the way. They had crossed their legs and were stroking their cocks with their hands. Each boy looked at me, I felt a pang of sympathy, but I dismissed it as jealousy. I was not sure if this would be just another excuse to go out and play some man to man sex. But just when I was beginning to think that I might be able to keep from making a game of it that night, I heard a car go by outside our house. I knew I was home. I just hoped I could not feel the guilt I felt when I heard them going at it.</p> <p>I tried to get the idea of what our friend had been doing out of my head. I wanted nothing more than to sleep with this woman. But I was totally out of it. In fact, I still felt a little guilty about what she had revealed to me about our relationship. Maybe it was because I didn't want to give it another try. Maybe that was just my weakness, but I couldn't take my mind off of the fact that I had a pretty big chance with her. There was a little light bulb at the end of a tunnel that didn't feel bad, but it was too much, maybe my guilt. I really didn't think I could handle the guilt that would follow and it was very intimidating to me.</p> <p>When I looked back on what the two of them had been doing and what he had been doing, I saw her come back from the bathroom. The couple she had left in the living room had been talking and she was getting dressed as I sat there. "Hi," she said and kissed me on the cheek. "How was school?"</p> <p>I smiled and said, "Yeah, it was good. Too great, and a great place to hang out, that kind of thing."</p> <p>I took it upon myself to try to make conversation with the other couple that were sitting across the room from me.
