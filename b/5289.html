"It is so nice to finally get your big dick home again. Let's enjoy each other's naked bodies as we sleep, we are going to need our energy for later!"</p> <p>They were still nude with each other and were just lying in the middle of the bed, snuggled up close like they were long lost friends having the rest of the night together. As her hand slowly moved up and down his length he started to stir. As he got up he kissed her gently and said "This is going to feel even better than I expected!"</p> <p>"You better believe it!" she said, she rolled over getting on top, kissing him in the middle. He could feel her juices running down his leg. She lifted herself off him on her back and then lowered herself down again. He moved up so that his hard shaft was level with her wet hole again. Slowly, ever so slowly he entered into her. They broke the kiss and he said "Oh my, that feels fantastic! You are ready!"</p> <p>She was smiling at him and said "I'm more than ready!" She pushed herself back onto him, and he slipped in deeper inside of her. Just as deeply as she had before it didn't hurt that much anymore, just felt so wonderful. It seemed to take forever to get it all in, but once it was all inside of her wonderful pussy it felt so good! It seemed like forever before her orgasm hit again, this time it was so big that it seemed to just roll and ripple through her body. She was in ecstasy. Her mind was wild! All there was was, and all that mattered was knowing just where his dick was going to reach and feel good, and just where it was going to end. Their lovemaking continued for a very long time. Each time he pulled out she pushed herself back onto him and felt him slip back inside her. Each time both of them came, she pushed herself back onto him, then slowly up, and back again, feeling him deep within her. It wasn't anything like when they were making love, it was so intense. And it was exciting and erotic at the same time.</p> <p>After they both came to a rest, she looked at him, smiled and said "Let's get dressed!" She didn't know what she was going to do, so she stayed naked with him and took his clothing from his hands. They slowly got out of bed, and got dressed. She couldn't keep from smiling at the memory of how his dick felt as it came out of her body. This was going to be the best anniversary ever, she thought as they got dressed.</p> <p>After they started to dress, they had a great dinner, and then they watched a movie. She had to have seen more of the movie. After they had settled down, and they were watching, she said, "Let's sit out on the balcony and watch the stars."</p> <p>"I agree, not as long as that is still on. I love that. A couple of glasses of wine each to relax us a bit"</p> <p>"So when we were sitting on the balcony it was like we could just stay hidden and not even look!"</p> <p>"That was definitely true!"</p> <p>"I got a really good feeling about it,"</p> <p>"Me too, I just knew that there was no way anyone could keep this from us!" she said, trying to make the situation seem more normal, but her mind was still going crazy from making that comment.</p> <p>After dinner, they got back to the room and flopped on the bed. After the talk, she said "I thought about just taking a shower but I didn't bring anything with me, I just thought I'd come get you."</p> <p>He said "I think I will go take a shower now, it was nice to have something for one last fling together, but it was pretty hot in there."</p> <p>"OK. That sounds good!"</p> <p>They both got a shower together and took a shower together in the shower, then they dried off a bit, and put on their robes, he went down to pick her up off the bed, she came down to help him in the bedroom. He took her robe off and she put both of hers on, and sat on the bed with him. They were looking at each other for a while. "What are we going to talk about this morning?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nothing, nothing is going to change. You will get everything back to normal before you know it."</p> <p>"Good for you! It has nothing to do with my relationship with you or your relationship with me."</p> <p>"Not at all."</p> <p>They both laughed at that.</p> <p>"I know that sounds like a weird thing to think, but I really enjoyed it."</p> <p>"I enjoyed it!
