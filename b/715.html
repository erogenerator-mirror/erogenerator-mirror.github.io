With the lights in, he turned to leave.</p> <p>"Hey," he started again, "I've been meaning to talk with you about this." He stared as the words left his head before he could stop themselves. "How did it take you for that long to figure out that I did it?"</p> <p>He was too far gone to be a complete idiot. Now the thought of him cheating on her with another man was crossing his mind. "I didn't know what to do. It took me days to find the trigger. You should have known, too," he smiled.</p> <p>"Yeah, right," she shrugged back. "I'll bet you went through it all while you were in high school." She took a deep breath, trying to calm her stomach, trying to find the reason he had done this. Her mind was spinning, not able to accept what she was seeing. He had broken her in, fucked her in more ways than one in her life.</p> <p>"I saw how angry you got on the phone. You have to have been thinking about it!"</p> <p>He sat, not moving, "I think you know what happened in high school, but at least I was sure that you had figured it out. As soon as I was over the phone, all you could do was go out on a date with some assholes. I could hardly get the thoughts of what had happened to you out. How do you think I got the information out?" he looked down at his hands, "I'm sorry you went through that. I know you had some bad things on your record, so I am sure it must have taken your mind at least a little to get to the point. I am sorry to hear now, but your anger might have been the key, I am sure." He was silent, but his expression was dark. She stared at the floor, wondering how or why he would have done this. She knew that if he told no one, she would make things right. That is why they always spoke about him as the first person that they would do it to. It seemed to work. If she only knew how he saw it.</p> <p>"Why don't we go?" he continued, "You need to know something. That is the important thing." Her emotions were in overdrive. All her feelings had been in overdrive, and she didn't know how to deal with all the guilt of what had happened. What was it about this man that turned her on? He was all she had ever wanted in a lover. They always had sex at least once a week, but she had not gotten off so many times. Was she in love with him? No. It was all a little too much.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, tears streaming down her face. "I'm sorry I had this happen for no reason. I swear that I would never ever cheat on you, but I never stopped thinking about it. When I was with you, all I wanted was those hot lips on my cock, but you turned me down. I am sorry, I didn't know how to handle this when I was married.</p> <p>He was quiet for a moment. He was sure that she wasn't upset about what he had said to her, but he didn't blame her for it. "I know that, now that you have this information," he took a deep breath, "It makes me sad that I can't control it, but you have to know that you are more important than what I have done to you," he looked her in the eye. "You can let anyone into your head like this." he paused to gather himself, "but it's going to take a little bit of work for me to overcome this. It is something that I have thought about, or maybe it is something that I would do, but I haven't. I have to give up, to go back to our marriage, to my parents, my work, whatever it takes. I can't do this alone, I have to give up that." He started to walk away, "I will let you know all that later. I would love to come over later to have a smoke, but then I have to get up, get this project to finish. It is important that I stay in touch with you, but I can't do that alone," he started to walk back to his house, a little too fast, "I know that, but I just can't see the point in moving from there." He looked back and saw her nodding, "I understand."</p> <p>She sat there, staring at the floor, unsure of how to feel. As he closed the front of her apartment building door, tears ran as she saw her friend. Tears of joy, of guilt, of what she had done, of the way people knew what happened between themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
