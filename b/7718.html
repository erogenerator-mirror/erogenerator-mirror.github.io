I... I... I need..." Kelly's heart raced. "I can't have... I..." she stammered, and looked up at Kevin with alarm, as though remembering having lost it in the past.</p> <p>"It's ok Kelly," Kevin consoled her. "Just give in. It won't change anything between you anymore. Don't go back to being like you were before they were. There's always room in our lives for this moment. I wish this day would just work itself out. I know how this has to be to get us in the sack. I know you're the one who helped me through all this, and I don't mean to pry."</p> <p>It seemed to be an eternity, before Kelly looked up and realized that Kevin stood up and approached her again.</p> <p>"Let me help you with those big teddy bear things again," he said, and cupped her face in his hand.</p> <p>"Don't you dare," Kelly cried. She was so frightened. Kevin helped her put on her dress and she slipped her heels on.</p> <p>"Don't worry; I'll be back to change."</p> <p>He had left the door open for her, and Kevin knew the whole scene would have been completely ruined, if she had wanted to stay home. He had gone to the bathroom, when Kelly walked over to him.</p> <p>"Oh Kevin, it's so nice to see you again," Kelly said, and held out her arms to him. He took them and ran his hands along her bare arms. He pulled her body into him, and held her tight. She felt completely safe.</p> <p>Kevin went across the room and back to the closet.</p> <p>"I'll go check on them while you change," he whispered as he headed out the door.</p> <p>Kevin and Kelly had been inseparable for the rest of high school; almost two years before when they were still in school.</p> <p>Kevin had always been a pretty nice guy to everyone, and Kelly had made him feel like the luckiest boy in the world. She loved him too much to let him go. She had always felt a need to protect him, and never wanted to hurt him. But she'd never really had a boyfriend, so she was not really in the mood to let him have her body. She had never, in her mind, felt really comfortable with other men, and never wanted Kevin.</p> <p>She had even dated one of them, and it was only the second time it happened. That first night she was with someone else wasn't really that serious, but her feelings when she had made out with him that night, for his sake - and hers for hers - had never really gotten much farther than an 'if they were gay' kiss that was really nothing more than a friendly peck, but even that thought didn't have the same affect on Kelly as it had when they had been first dating.</p> <p>Since then, they had continued to get to know each other better, and they had gotten even closer in her eyes than she had ever imagined her life could have. She'd been thinking of him a lot, and wanted to get the most from his mind. For her, that first night together definitely would be the most exciting, and sexual experience of her life. She wanted it to only end with Kevin. She didn't want him to feel left out of the deal, or the deal was a one time thing between them. She would let him make the decision; and never allow him to get hurt again. She would never let anyone hurt her or leave her unsatisfied once he did.</p> <p>Kevin was waiting at the door, looking nervous and nervous for his own good. He felt like a complete dork, and he looked forward to getting in the act.</p> <p>"Hey, Kelly, let's go get a movie," he said, taking her hand.</p> <p>"Kevin, that would be really great," Kelly replied, turning her face up to him. "Please don't ask any more stupid questions; I am serious. What would you like to see?"</p> <p>"I'd love to see you suck my cock Kelly," Kevin said cheerfully. "I'm sure it would be a pleasure to put it in your mouth."</p> <p>Kelly had been so surprised and relieved as well that she immediately broke out into a big smile in return. She had always considered Kevin an amazing guy. They shared so much in common that she had never been able to figure herself out for her own good.</p> <p>"What if I'm not gay?" she said with a giggle. She had never been able to go there, but she figured she might be able to make something of herself. She had already given up guys to, and she loved her work, at least as much as she loved her husband.</p> <p>Kevin agreed with Kelly'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
