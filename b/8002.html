He felt a surge of adrenalin course through his body. She stopped, letting the water spray from her, while the water washed all the sweat and excitement from his body leaving his whole body glistening. She stood beside him, her hands cupping under his chin to draw his head down to her breast. Their eyes were locked together for just a second, while she moved the cloths over his face. Her breasts were full of milk. He tasted the salt on her warm skin and he was glad she hadn't removed them. He sucked on her breast, not enough to remove it, but enough to keep him alive, and in that second of time his body was on fire. This woman was driving him to an animalistic level of lust, driving him insane with desire and pain, while his cock was getting harder and stiffer. She stroked his cock, feeling him get harder in her hand.</p> <p>She released his head in the water and let his head rise to drink from her right breast. She moved the cloth over his face with her right hand, then let the cloth clean his face. She removed the cloth from his mouth, leaving him smelling her breast. She lifted the cloth from his mouth, his cock sticking straight out like a flag pole as he sucked and nibbled her nipple, not even caring where he was, or not doing. She held out another cloth, more moist and wet with hot water in her hand, but she could smell him, hear his breathing, smell the musk of sex on his tongue. She smiled to herself. She had always liked this kind of sex. This little game. She took the cloth, letting his skin soaped it, then he was able to smell her body. He felt the heat on his body. She took the cloth and held it over his penis to see. She started over his belly, the tip of his cock peeking out from his body. She stroked his body, his cock. After several minutes, she got him to lay on the bed, his head on the blanket, his feet at the edge of the bed. She stroked him, rubbed his balls and shaft. Her body, his body. She moved to kneel near his face, so he could kiss her lips and face, and to take his own sweet liquid in his mouth. Then she got on the bed, so they were in a 69 position, his cock right at her face, her legs between his. They kissed and moaned into each other's mouths, their mouths sucking on each other. She was in heaven. This was the best sex she had ever had.</p> <p>She moved over him, letting him slip into her pussy, as she rubbed his face between her breasts, then she took hold of him from the other side of his head. This time she held him in her pussy, her clit rubbing against his bottom lip and she could feel his tongue sliding into her open pussy. She could see his cock slide into her, and she moaned as she did it.</p> <p>She pulled herself up again to kiss him full on the mouth. Their tongues touching, moving, tasting, touching each other with passion and passion. She could feel his cock throbbing under her, as she rubbed herself against him. She could hear the soft, slick sound of her wet pussy being pulled up to meet his thrusting tongue between her lips. The soft sounds of their tongues dancing together, the sound of her wet pussy on his mouth as he fucked her with his mouth. He moaned into her mouth as he felt a wave of pleasure come over him, and he moaned himself to his balls when she pushed against his cock, and then she pushed herself away from him and turned around to sit on her knees, and look at him.</p> <p>She moved closer to him, her breasts and stomach on his face, and she could feel his tongue against her ass, and she slid her pussy down his mouth to taste him, then back up again to lick his face, lick his lips, kiss him, and stroke his cock. She sat on his mouth so she could use his tongue in her pussy to stroke her clit. She rubbed her clit against his tongue, then her head to the side so she could watch his cock in her pussy, slide in and out with his tongue, and she felt him moan on her clit as he did. She was getting close.</p> <p>It had been nearly four hours, and she was so hot that she wanted to come so badly. She had let him fuck her twice and let him cum on her breasts, but never allowed it to touch her face. She had thought she was past it. She had loved him and wanted to tell him how it was okay to fuck her, but she couldn't. She wanted to take control. She wanted him to feel her. She wanted him to be there, to make her cum.
