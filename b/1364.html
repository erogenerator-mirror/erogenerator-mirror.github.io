She stepped back, sliding her hand down from my thigh and pushing mine away from her. She pressed two fingers into me, curving her fingers slightly and sending a shock of pleasure through me as my fingers brushed her smooth skin. I felt her fingers slide up and down along my length, almost pulling me away, almost, but not quite, sliding into me with a certain amount of urgency.</p> <p>I closed my eyes to try to focus on what I was feeling as my sister’s fingers worked in me, the pressure building within me, building to an intense orgasm. I began to feel my stomach turn and my eyes roll back on a downward look - my legs tightened around hers - as I felt her fingers moving in me deeper and harder, the pleasure and desire building along with the tension within me, my fingers tightening against hers. “Oh god, I’m cumming!” I whispered, the words spilling out as though they had just come out of my mouth. One of her fingers tightened in me, and I gasped as an incredible climax began to overtake me. I could feel my orgasm begin as she pressed her finger deeper, her finger stroking rapidly in me, making the waves of pleasure feel like they would never stop.</p> <p>As the sensations of my orgasm subsided, I felt the fingers pull themselves out of me and slide slowly down my body. I opened my eyes and watched her lick up the juices from where she had touched me, and lick them all off her fingers before she sat down. “Shit,” she muttered to herself under her breath. “We better clean this shit up again, or I’ll never leave you alone again.” She got up and headed for the bedroom bathroom.</p> <p>I sat up on the bed and rolled on my side, resting my head against the pillow. I closed my eyes and thought about the amazing pleasure that had just given me. I had never felt so wonderful. We had been so caught up in the moment, so charged up. And I hadn’t even known what it was to be a woman, let alone actually acting like one. But, there was only so much more. There was only so much.</p> <p>The following morning I was dressed up when I heard the door open in the living room. My mother and her daughter looked up as my brother’s housekeeper, who had been the first to arrive in the house the previous weekend, walked casually up to her and kissed her cheek, which she then did in turn.</p> <p>“Hi Mrs," she said with a smile. “I’m Amanda.” She was wearing a pair of pink shorts and a white t-shirt that looked like it had come out of the closet. It fit around her, and she had a small waist on her figure and large breasts, and a large stomach.</p> <p>I stared at her for a long moment, until my eyes drifted down her full rounded breasts. “Amanda,” I said, with a chuckle.</p> <p>"I’m so glad you’re here.” She answered, grinning, and giving me a warm hug, which I took in my hand. “And I guess you feel the same, too,” my mother said.</p> <p>Amanda kissed my cheek before she disappeared into the kitchen and got a can of Coke from the fridge. I got up and followed her back up the stairs, leaving the door open in an effort to see what Amanda had. It was obvious she had packed a full day’s worth of clothes before coming in, and was just getting ready to head over to the supermarket. When she got there, it wasn’t immediately obvious that she had arrived early as there were no clothes in sight. I was about to suggest she wasn’t in, when I heard her say, “You shouldn’t spend all day in your underwear, but I figured you could use some help.” She walked back to the kitchen and stood by the stove, leaning over, putting her hands lightly on her hips.</p> <p>I took a moment to look over at her and was disappointed that she wasn’t wearing a bra; I had thought it might be best if I wore something else, like my shorts. When I looked back at her, she was smiling, her eyes darting between the television and the wall clock radio. She looked good.</p> <p>“I know you’re home early.” I said to her. “But, it’s getting late, and I thought maybe we could get a bite to eat at home. You can do what you like,” I added—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
