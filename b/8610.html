I asked, feigning concern.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Because I don't want to hurt your feelings on the matter."</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh? So we'll have to keep it at a reasonable level."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I could handle watching you."</p> <p>"You won't see me any other way!"</p> <p>"That's a pity. Maybe you were meant to be with me tonight. You're a lovely boy and I would really like to be with you."</p> <p>I reached out for him but he stopped me, put his hand to my lips and I was left standing in the hot, humid silence of the club. It was a wonderful, comforting silence while the club went dark around me. After an age, I found myself at a table in the middle of the room. To say I could not see him was like saying a child had walked into a store. He sat between me and one of the dancefloor acts. I could picture the two of us dancing together as we made eyes at each other. I could feel his fingers gently caressing my lower lip in his mouth. I shivered as I felt his erection pressing against me. We broke off and his hand went to my breast and in a flash he had managed to get my button undone. His warm fingers slipped inside my blouse and onto my naked breasts. I felt the excitement build inside me. I felt my nipples harden and then the softness of a breast as I felt two fingers exploring their way around my stiffening bud, while my right hand roamed down his belly and to his hip. My body tingled as the fingers moved around inside me. The excitement in my loins overwhelmed me. My right hand rose on to the table and moved to undo her shorts. I was desperate to open her jeans when the band stopped playing.</p> <p>"I love your eyes! It's you!" he said.</p> <p>I reached down for my jeans, but he took mine off. I had hardly buttoned my fly when my hand began to explore my body to see just how much the touch of his young body could make me feel. I took his hand and pushed it down to my breasts and felt that they were ready to go.</p> <p>"You do have an amazing body," I whispered in his ear, as I felt his cock start to swell under his shorts. My fingers continued up to find the clasp of the bra sheath and unfasten it. The garment fell naturally from my body and revealed my breasts to her hands. The sight of my hands as I undid the clasp and her hands cupped my nipples. I wanted to go further but she wasn't going to take my word for it. She removed the bra and his fingers slipped between my breasts. Her hands covered mine as she explored them. I could feel my own fingers tracing circles around my outer labia. I held no other thought of anything except that moment and the feel of the young lover I had come to know. The only thing I could think of at that moment was the excitement the sight of his big cock was arousing.</p> <p>His fingers explored my sex and I could feel the heat rising. I pushed his hand further down my front and found that his middle finger slipped into my cleft. I was gasping as I felt him start to push in and out of me but I knew it couldn't happen. As I pushed down to meet him, he stopped pushing.</p> <p>"I just want you to feel my cock!"</p> <p>"Mmmmm," I murmured.</p> <p>"I told you it's hard! Don't stop! Go on!"</p> <p>His hand started to move more forcefully in and out of my cunt. My hand returned to my breast squeezing it and lifting it for better access. The other hand moved down to my belly and my fingers slipped inside my panties. I wanted to come, I wanted to take his hard cock, I wanted my fingers inside me.</p> <p>"Yes, just like that!" I cried. My hand came up to his face and we kissed long and deep. I could taste my juices on his lips and he groaned at the sensation. Our bodies writhed together, his hands caressing my body as mine explored him. It was just when we both decided we wouldn't finish, our mouths were sealed with the need to get the other to come down for a breather. It was not long before I was in his arms but this time we were standing.</p> <p>"What would you like me to do for you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Whatever you want," I replied.</p> <p>It felt as if we were being given permission to fuck, yet I was unable to speak. I felt his tongue tracing my lips, darting in and out, as he put his arms round me and his tongue was suddenly exploring my mouth. I could taste myself on him and it was wonderful. We broke off for breath, his handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
