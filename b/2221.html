I bet I can guess..." I asked with a big grin, "You're pretty big!" She giggled and pulled me closer.</p> <p>"Hey, I'm not doing your homework!"</p> <p>"But you can check mine, even if I can't feel anything or even if it happens! That's pretty hot, I can tell!" Then it was her turn to blush. My grin spread over her face.</p> <p>"You're really, really cute!" I said excitedly.</p> <p>Then I went wild telling her all of the things I was going to do to her, and even if it really was for her own benefit as she enjoyed it. And she was really into it herself.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, "that is a lot fun, you should be so lucky to get laid! That's the real deal for real! A lot of people love it. I could see you guys did it. You even went down on me! Wow, I can't tell you how turned on you got at that. I thought it was you on top, or it couldn't have been..." she got distracted, her breathing deep.</p> <p>"That's just it," I said, "You can't feel anything, and you can't really touch! And I know you don't like doing it, and all I'm trying to say is it can't be. Don't worry about that, just keep it nice and secret, please." I was being really sweet to her now, it was starting to go a bit deeper than I had planned on being, but I could tell she was really turned on. And her hands were trembling a bit.</p> <p>"If you really need something, just ask, I don't want to push it. Just give me a chance, try it, see what the hell to do. If it hurts or if someone really hurts you, just say something. I'm not hurting you, I just want to please you, I'm just trying to have fun. Let yourself go."</p> <p>She was shaking like a leaf in her arms, looking like she was about to run away. Like I told her, she was a little anxious and had trouble getting control, so I figured it was best if we just let her go for a moment.</p> <p>She was shaking like a leaf in her arms, and trying to catch her breath, or to keep a grip on herself. I helped her out of her bra and panties. Then we kissed, her mouth hungrily seeking my own. After a couple moments, we were both naked. I couldn't believe how turned on and hot we both were! I couldn't keep my hands off her body now!</p> <p>Soon we were kissing and exploring each other. Her nipples had already started to get hard, and her pussy started to get wet all of a sudden. As she ran her fingers down my belly, she felt me get even harder and harder. She reached under my shirt and gently massaged my nipples, sending waves of pleasure straight trough my whole body. She then put two of her fingers down to my crotch. They were still wet from her pussy, and I wanted her badly. She took them to my lips, putting them in a couple of her saliva.</p> <p>"You taste great", she said, lapping her tongue against them. Then she started to stroke my cock, starting at the top and gently down the shaft. Once her hand was in full grip and stroking me good, she stopped sucking and got up on her knees in front of me, taking my dick in her hands. My dick was standing up and pointing right at her eyes. We kissed a bit more, her tongue running along my jaw line.</p> <p>After the two minutes had elapsed, she looked up at me and said, "I want you in me. I want you in my cunt." She stood there and I reached out and felt that amazing pussy under my hands.</p> <p>I was a little surprised at first. What was happening here? I looked over at her, and seeing that she had a big grin on her face, I said, "Oh, I just thought...that is so naughty. You want to do that?" We both started to laugh, even though this was all new to her.</p> <p>"Come on, get on the bed, face up!" I pulled her away from between my legs, and lay down on the bed. She was lying next to me, and we kissed so hard and long, like the lovers did before our first time. She pulled me up and then turned over. She wanted to try something too.</p> <p>"I want you naked", she said. I took off my shirt, which I took off in record time, and she got a real close look at my body under water. God, it felt good. Her eyes went wide, and she started moving up and down it, lickingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
