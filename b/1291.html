I was still lying on my back with my arms in the middle of the bed and my legs hanging over the edge of the mattress. "Honey, wake up for a moment.” With that she got up and left the room.</p> <p>I lay there as the girl’s fingertips started caressing my temples and my head. She gently rubbed my scalp. After about a minute she moved up to gently stroke my face. I think I must have woken up because she asked how I was feeling. “I am so hot. I could really use a good fucking.” She then kissed me tenderly and moved down to massage my shoulders and neck.</p> <p>She kept this up for about 15 minutes and then asked if I was alright. “Yes, we should go now if that’s what you’re wondering about.”</p> <p>I started to get up off the bed and turned to say bye, but she was gone. I sat up and we embraced. We kissed again and then she started putting her clothes on.</p> <p>“Oh sweetie. I want more now.” She looked down and said, “I don’t want you to feel you have to walk into this.” She went and got in her car and waited for me to get dressed. She asked me to come out and walk her home. I did as she asked.</p> <p>We walked her whole house, except for all the doors, to see if anyone was following me so we couldn’t be seen. In the end we made a total fool of ourselves, we didn’t say anything and after that we left with nothing but smiles.</p> <p>“My name is Kim. I heard you had to go out and buy a new dress. Don’t call home often. I really enjoyed the show.”</p> <p>“Thank you and now I can’t wait to see the clothes that you bought.”</p> <p>I looked at her and said, “You are so beautiful.”</p> <p>“Thanks.”</p> <p>We walked home in silence. We got into my car and headed toward her town house. The car couldn’t wait. We went in and sat down in the living room with her. She then stood up and went to the kitchen. I started to sit down when I heard a female voice call, “Would you please pour me some wine? We usually don’t talk in there.”</p> <p>I opened her door and got out of the car. Kim walked over to us and opened her door. She then leaned toward me and asked me to kiss her again. I kissed her gently and she responded by getting in her seat and looking at me. “Do you kiss like a girl? It’s so warm too.”</p> <p>I kissed her again and she responded by putting her arms around me and returning my kiss. She then stood, looked me right in the eye and said, “I like kissing like a girl too.”</p> <p>We were both so aroused, she could not get enough of me. We just wanted more and more of each other. She told me to get the bottle out of her house, put on more revealing clothes before she returned. She closed the door and left.</p> <p>After I got the glasses out, I drank two of them right off of the bottle. It just felt so good. I couldn’t help feeling the blood rush back into my veins. It was not all that bad. After the glasses had been drank Kim said, “Honey, how about this kiss?” She started giving me a show. She moved in close to me and started rubbing my breasts through the thin fabric of my dress. It was exciting for me too. Suddenly, she put one hand down my dress, through the buttons on the front and took a hold of my right nipple. I could feel it getting hard under her touch. She then used her lips to kiss me with a kiss that seemed to last forever. I was getting lightheaded.</p> <p>After a while we stood and I could feel a strong desire stirring in both of us. “Please go into the bedroom honey.” I said, “I am exhausted.”</p> <p>She smiled as she went—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
