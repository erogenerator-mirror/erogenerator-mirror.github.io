You know how you love a woman to touch you."</p> <p>"Yes, she did," she answered as she lowered her head to his lap, her lips just inches from his erection. There was no other reason she would want his cock in her mouth but it was there. Just as he could not think of her as any of those women, as much as he hated her, there was only a desire that drove her to please him.</p> <p>His fingers tangled in her hair as she held him in the warm wet embrace of her mouth. He was already so hard and so thick, both of them thinking of what she would do to him. He could not believe he had given up control of her to him, but had to give her more pleasure every day for the rest of her life. As he had to admit he felt it was an important part of her being; to learn to please and pleasure him every day. It all seemed so much more important to him than what he had just done. It was the most important part of her being.</p> <p>He watched out of the corner of his eyes as she slowly pulled her mouth away from him. Her face was flushed and excited with excitement. Her breasts were heaving up and down on her chest and her face looked alluring.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me, Jack?" she asked.</p> <p>He was surprised at his own words, "Yes, Amanda, I want you so much," he replied as he lifted her onto him and lowered her onto him. He loved the idea of lying there with her all over him as he looked at the way she looked at him. His hands were lightly touching her, feeling her every move, every movement of her body.</p> <p>"Oh yes, Jack, it's so much better than what I did to you," she cooed as her head slowly turned to look at him. "You're so strong and hard like now. It's so good to have you in me again."</p> <p>He lowered his head to kiss her on her neck, her breasts, and on her stomach. "Do you want me to fuck you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes, Jack," she answered, "I want you fuck me, now."</p> <p>After a deep breath he raised his head and looked down at her. The smile she had left on her face was all he could see. Her eyes were glazed over. The way her head was turned was alluring and erotic. She was almost inviting, yet his hands were slowly caressing her body with an intense urgency. His head dipped down to begin moving down her belly with kisses and nibbles. He was amazed at how much of him was inside her, his whole groin felt as it rubbed against her wetness with every move her body made.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she cooed. "Your cock feels so big."</p> <p>"Yes, I know," he whispered as his eyes were transfixed on the dark patch of hair covered her pussy. A slight flush was spreading across her body as he took in the sight of her smooth pussy lips that were open and glistening, his cock nestled between them.</p> <p>Suddenly he could take it no more. "Amanda, do you want me to fuck you?" he asked as he moved his hips up so his large head was pressing at her entrance.</p> <p>Her head was lifted up. "Yes, of course I want you to fuck me."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes," she groaned, her eyes glazed over.</p> <p>His head pushed in and stopped just inside her. She felt as though a warm fire was growing inside of her and she could feel it burn her as he slowly pushed into her. The sensations were exquisite, she could not believe that she was so full of cock but she could not be that full again. She could barely feel him even if he had pushed in all the way. Then he was all the way inside her.</p> <p>Her body tightened around him and she moaned as he stretched her further. When she felt him at her cervix she was overcome with a complete joy. It was a feeling so intense it was frightening.</p> <p>Her body jerked as he began moving faster over her. She wanted to feel him moving in and out of her, not just fucking her. His hips were flying up and down in response to the movements of her body. She could feel his balls slapping against her clit and her own body started to respond to the friction as well.</p> <p>As he felt her respond to his movements he knew that his own was also responding. He wanted her to cum with him even as she was cumming with so many of her own. He wanted her to feel all of him inside her.</p> <p>"Amanda, I'm going to cum," he groaned and stopped for a moment.</p> <p>Her body began moving againstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
