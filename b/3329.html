"Ohhhhh, yes, please, I... I can feel you," she pleaded, opening her eyes again, and looking down at me.</p> <p>"Your turn," I smiled, and as if on cue, she did, lowering her shoulders and pulling her hips back and opening herself up to me. I smiled, taking a step closer and sliding into her, taking my cock all the way in one motion, causing her to gasp again. I began to fuck her, my hips working together, and she closed her eyes, trying to hold on to what she felt, her body starting to relax, so I pulled out of her slowly, and she gasped again, eyes squeezing shut against the feelings.</p> <p>She moaned softly, and I looked down at her. She looked back up at me, sweat dripping down from her forehead onto her chest, and I could see how excited she was.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she mumbled, "I didn't mean to make you feel that way."</p> <p>Not exactly how I wanted to let her feel, but I was going to give her what she wanted if she let me. "Don't worry about it," I whispered, and then pulled her hips down again.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!!," she gasped, and I began to pull back out, only to shove back inside her and drive back in again. She groaned, and I took that into account.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh, yes!!! Fuck me, please fuck me."</p> <p>I was still looking at her, and she looked up at me, her face blushing crimson, looking almost angelic with an almost mischievous look in her eyes. Her tits were hanging down, swaying back and forth as I continued to fuck her, enjoying her expressions when my cock bumped into her clit.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus, please do it again."</p> <p>I slowed down, and she looked down at my cock moving against her clit and back up at me again.</p> <p>"Please!" she whimpered.</p> <p>I did. I drove forward again, and she sighed deeply.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, goddddddd!!!"</p> <p>I kept on fucking her, pushing her hips down until she was completely lying on top of me. I felt her hands gripping on to my ass, and I lifted up, watching her tits as they lifted in the air and she wrapped her legs around me, her feet touching my ass.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmm," she mumbled, and it was just like her first time. Her ass moved as I fucked her, not pushing me out, just sliding back and forth on my cock. She moaned deeply, her face going pale, her eyes closing. Her voice was barely higher, but she seemed to sense me in her.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh, yes!!!"</p> <p>I felt her hips start to buck again, and I kept moving my cock all the way into her. She moaned once more, her hands lifting up to wrap around to my chest.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh, that feel's so good in me."</p> <p>I felt her feet moving, and it was an awesome sensation. She was sliding up and down my hard cock, and each time she came back down, her body shook, and she moaned.</p> <p>"God, yes!!!" she whimpered again, "Don't stop!!"</p> <p>She kept going, and after what seemed like forever, she finally went limp.</p> <p>"Don't stop," she whimpered.</p> <p>I stopped moving, and she wrapped her arms around me, pulling me close.</p> <p>"We're going to be good friends," I told her. "Promise me!"</p> <p>"I promise, and I won't tell a soul. But it's been a while for me. Can you promise me you won't tell anyone?"</p> <p>She thought for a moment, and then said, "I promise."</p> <p>I kissed her lips, then pulled her hips onto me. She moaned as I thrust up into her again, and I could feel I could come quickly this time.</p> <p>I stopped moving and said, "Just relax."</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked at me. "I'm sorry," she told me.</p> <p>"It's OK, I've seen the way you look at me."</p> <p>I pushed up, pushing into her again.</p> <p>"You're not the only one, you know," she said, then leaned her head on my shoulder.</p> <p>"I... I'm all yours anytime, any way we want," I told her.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, you're all mine," she smiledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
