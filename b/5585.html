I thought you just wanted a piece of me."</p> <p>The words were out of her mouth before she could stop them. He lifted her up into his arms and carried her back to the bedroom. He carried her onto the bed and lay her down. He stood back to admire his work. "My good," he said. "This is something I've always loved to do."</p> <p>"It is?" she asked, feeling her inhibitions lowering, and wanting him more than she'd ever wanted a man, more than she ever wanted to even touch herself, the desire for sex in her heart growing with every inch he moved. "You know what you want right?" she asked. "Now that we've both had our cocks in me that is. Come get your cock ready for me."</p> <p>His cock was already hard as he walked back to the bed and got it ready for her. She watched him strip as he walked around her, and slowly undressed himself. She saw the head of his cock swell and get even harder at her touch. "Don't be shy," she smiled and reached for him. "Come to Mama, baby," she cooed, "and put that hot thing inside me while I suck it for you."</p> <p>He wasn't going to argue, not this time. She took his member in her hand and sucked on it while she moved her mouth up and down the shaft, making loud slurping sounds on his cock. She could tell that he wasn't going to last long. So she sucked him hard and fast until he almost burst before she pulled away and sat up, looking up at him with those beautiful eyes. Her fingers slowly slid into her panties and pulled them off along with her skirt.</p> <p>"Come to Mama, baby," she ordered, laying back on the bed and opening her legs for him. He sat down between her legs, and with one hand gently rubbed her clit over and over. She was already wet, and his fingers danced easily over the slick flesh as her legs spread for him.</p> <p>He lifted her legs up a bit and positioned himself between them, pressing his rock hard cock against her. He was hot inside her as he pushed his hips forward and his cock slid easily into her cunt. "Yes," she cried, "yes, honey, yes!" and she felt herself begin to move in time to his thrusts.</p> <p>Slowly at first, he increased the pounding he was giving her, and then started to fuck her harder. He had never felt so much power in her. She knew if she hadn't felt so much of him in her, she would have cum right then and there. She was his now, and it was time for him to know that he was hers.</p> <p>She moaned out as his thrusts began to get faster, more powerful, each thrust pushing his cock further into her. His hands slid down to her ass, feeling the firm flesh with his fingers as he began to fuck her harder. She couldn't move but the thrusts got harder and harder, and soon he was moving very quickly in and out of her wet snatch.</p> <p>It didn't take her long to feel that familiar pressure build in her as she felt herself begin to climax. She was panting and moaning now as she wrapped her legs tightly around his back with her heels on. His thrusts kept ramming her cunt with as much urgency as his cock was ramming her. She kept on cumming, and she knew it wouldn't be long before she couldn't take much more of it.</p> <p>She felt her orgasm start as he leaned forward and began to bite her clit. It hurt, even though she was on the verge of cumming. He didn't have to. Her body knew it. It knew it.</p> <p>"Oh, god!" she cried out, coming all over his hand and cock.</p> <p>With his mouth right next to hers he let everything out, and she fell limp in his armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
