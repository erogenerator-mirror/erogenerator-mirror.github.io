Is there anything I can do to please you now instead?" she asked softly.</p> <p>"Actually, there is. You do seem to like that a lot, baby. You know you have no idea how much I like to suck it, and it always makes me feel good when I think they feel really good in my mouth. You know what I like, I like it a lot. It's always been something I enjoyed and I've even gotten a couple of the boys to reciprocate." he said with some amusement in his tone.</p> <p>"Oh, well...that's nice. I guess we'll see...but you have never been to my place, have you?" She whispered.</p> <p>"We have. Actually, if you want to, I can change the sheets and we can take your things to my room instead of yours, I have things to do." he said, pulling something from under his arm. "I hope you feel very comfortable with that in your room. I'm sure we won't be disturbed."</p> <p>"Oh, you won't be disturbed?" she said as she nodded her head.</p> <p>"Of course not...but I think you might feel uncomfortable if we continue this." he said, as he reached under the sheet and pulled out some papers. He had not been so quick though, his hand hadn't been quick. He was stroking his already hard cock to hardness, his eyes never leaving hers. That was the moment of truth. If this was what he wanted, then he would certainly continue. As if a small part of him understood. He knew if he moved so just the tip would slip out of the top of the sheet and he would have to stop himself from getting a hard-on. He didn't. He didn't know what would happen next.</p> <p>He did not though. He didn't move his head and just watched as her eyes flashed and she smiled and winked. They both watched as she reached beneath the sheet again and pulled it off, but with some difficulty, revealing that she had already shed her panties.</p> <p>He did not move his head at all. "My god, she said. Do you remember? I've never done this before, have I?" he asked her as he sat up in shock after all of the things she had told him, but all the things he had wanted to do to himself, to be touched, to make love to, to kiss, to touch. He saw the desire and her hunger in that look. He saw his wife with no hesitation, no reserve at all. He remembered her words, "You've never done anything else before," and he nodded his head to indicate that she had had.</p> <p>"Yes, you have." he said back to her.</p> <p>"But you wouldn't be doing that to me, would you now?" she asked, her hand rubbing his cock in front of her face.</p> <p>"No, I suppose not. But if I do this, I'll have to move things a bit." he said, as he got to his feet and helped her roll over, exposing his hard-on to her. "I just thought we might have some fun on the bed, if we get to that point, but all that I am going to do is enjoy looking at you in some of the things you've told me you wanted to do...or to suck. It's a good thing I know what I am doing," he said as he reached out to stroke her hair, as she lay naked before him, her legs parted and spread for him by the sheets, her sex open to him, as he rubbed his hard cock. "What are you doing to me, baby? Will you enjoy this?" he said again as he stroked her hair, pulling himself close to her mouth where she licked and kissed his shaft, licking his balls, the base of the cock on the top of his balls.</p> <p>As he continued to stroke her hair, his hand moving up to her breast and cupping it. His cock pressing hard into her stomach. He felt him begin to lose all control; he was going to come too, and he knew he could. He felt her teeth in the side of his cock as he pushed forward, hard. "Oh, God...oh God. I'm coming...I'm coming...oh, God, oh God. Oh fuck...oh God," he said, as she pushed her head down on him and took him deep into her throat.</p> <p>She sucked and licked her way up his shaft and was careful not to spill a drop or lose any. She had done enough for both of them. She had sucked him in her mouth, with his cock in her hand, while he had her breasts in her open mouth, with his cock buried deep within her throat.
