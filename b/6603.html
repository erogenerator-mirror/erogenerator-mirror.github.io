We could still do that, I just hope you don't mind if I come in and..."</p> <p>"No-," he replied hastily, "I don't mind at all. Just... you know... do your thing"</p> <p>"If you like..."</p> <p>"Well, it's ok with me I guess. I want to do it with you... It's just hard to get a grip on myself right now. I'm not a lesbian, you know." He told her. She smiled at that and said that she knew what she meant and that she knew that as soon as they got to the stage to do it would be her.</p> <p>"I can't wait to see what you do to my... oh... cock!" she said, trying to take her own words in and not being too shy. His grin widened and he knew what she had in mind and the way he looked at her made her want that thing as much as he did.</p> <p>"I'm really going to let this work," she told him, "So if someone gets hurt... you call me and I'll come right over."</p> <p>"Okay," he agreed, "I still can't believe that we're going to do this or we'd get all hot and bothered. But we just have to have a word to set things on course and..."</p> <p>He paused and tried to be as positive as he could as he stared at her as if he thought he'd somehow come across as over enthusiastic.</p> <p>"Come on, you know you want me, and I feel like a..."</p> <p>"I do." He replied softly.</p> <p>"And if you don't? I mean... you're not going to say 'no' either." She told him. The little smile on her face was making him want to kiss her and he didn't think he needed to either.</p> <p>"I do, but...," he answered, "And you have to promise not to try to force me."</p> <p>"Like I really care for you anyway?" she asked with a little smile.</p> <p>"No, but like I said, if it'll make you feel better to at least, just go with it."</p> <p>She smiled and stood up before him slowly and pulled him toward the door. When she turned him to kiss him again, her hand moved to the zipper of his jeans, "We have to make this look good for yourself... we've never... you know... done anything like this before."</p> <p>"Ok..." he said, smiling and feeling a bit confused. She was right, though, and just when he thought she was going to tear everything down, well, now... the front of his pants hit his crotch and he was getting so erect! He glanced down and could see that his underwear were soaked through. He also felt his cock growing bigger with excitement.</p> <p>As soon as his hands got around her waist, his fingers slipped under her tiny skirt, gently rubbing her thigh through the soft cotton.</p> <p>"I said... ok," she told him as she moved in his arms and pressed her body against him, "No- but if you really are willing, we'll never be the same."</p> <p>He could not disagree with that.</p> <p>She led him to the little car in the back of the lot and they got in it, the first passenger. After kissing the side of his head, he moved his mouth down her neck to her shoulder, sucking gently.</p> <p>"I've been wanting to do this for such a long time," he told her softly, "You know I'll do whatever I've ever wanted to do."</p> <p>"I know you will, Tom," she said as she put her hand behind his head and drew his mouth to her chest, "Let's just go slow because now it could very well be very, very painful for me."</p> <p>She was right, and when he started to undo her blouse buttons, she stopped him, "No touching," she told him sternly.</p> <p>Tom wasn't sure he wanted to do so, but he also wanted to do the right thing, so he kissed his way down her belly until he reached her panties. Then he pushed them down and helped her step out of them. When she stood before him, her pussy now a few centimeters away, he moved his face close to it, and just as she let out a sigh, opened his mouth and took her little button between his lips.</p> <p>He felt it start to swell, and his tongue caressed her pussy, running up and down it until finally he felt her legs buckle, and then he lifted her so that he could lie down beside her.</p> <p>"God... you've got the nicest lips," he mumbled onto her breast. He felt her put her hand toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
