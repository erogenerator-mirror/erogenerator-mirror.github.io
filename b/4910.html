I asked.</p> <p>She just smiled and held it tighter.</p> <p>My mind kept asking, “Where could we have been going,”” and “Would I have missed it if we stayed for just another minute?”</p> <p>"We better stop before we get caught," she said.</p> <p>As we were walking together I kissed her and told her, “I think we had better stop and we could figure all this out.”</p> <p>She laughed as she turned and headed down the hallway of my room.</p> <p>We had only a minute to be in my room.</p> <p>“That was close," she said.</p> <p>I reached out and pulled her toward me and kissed her softly.</p> <p>"I think we better do it right now," she said softly.</p> <p>“I think we would be perfect here," I said.</p> <p>She kissed me again and smiled, "Yes we would."</p> <p>We went to the mirror and I turned around.</p> <p>I was amazed at how sexy and beautiful she looked.</p> <p>I turned so I was facing her and she leaned back a little so I could kiss her neck.</p> <p>“Oh that feels so good," she said as I kissed her.</p> <p>I moved down a little lower on her body and nibbled and sucked on her exposed neck while I kissed her shoulder. I could see the excitement in her eyes that always makes me crazy.</p> <p>When I touched her pussy I could feel the moisture. I pulled my lips away from hers, “Not here.” Then I kissed around her ear, down to her neck and over to her breasts.</p> <p>“Oh that feels so good,” she said breathlessly.</p> <p>I nibbled on her ear and she moaned a little and moved her head backward. I continued to move down over her breasts and down her belly.</p> <p>“Oh yes,” she moaned.</p> <p>I kissed her thigh and she spread her legs so I could move between them.</p> <p>I kissed back up her thigh and over her knee to her other thigh and back down again. I kissed her legs again and repeated the process. I could feel her moisture starting to build again. I kissed the inside of her thigh and then moved to her other thigh. I could feel her getting wetter as I moved away from her. I reached up with my hand and slid it gently up her stomach to her panties.</p> <p>“Don’t stop,” she pleaded, "Just let me feel how wonderful it is,” she said.</p> <p>My fingers slowly slid higher and higher under her panties. I slid my hands up around to her stomach and then into the elastic. I was pleased to feel how smooth and soft her skin was. I slid a finger up into her panties and began to rub against her pussy for all I was worth.</p> <p>“Oh yes,” she moaned.</p> <p>I pulled her panties down slowly and watched as they dropped to the floor. I took a moment to appreciate the beauty of her body. From this vantage point I could see her perfect pussy and her small breasts. Her pussy was shaven clean except for the little landing strip at her pussy.</p> <p>I took a minute to admire her body for a moment until she moved her legs to the side and looked at me.</p> <p>“It is beautiful,” she said softly.</p> <p>I moved a little closer and began to kiss her lips again. This time she was not hesitant. It was very different kissing a man on the mouth. I moved my hand down her body and touched her clit for the very first time. There was no barrier between us. It seemed to have no purpose other than to stimulate her body. I rubbed her clit a little faster and she began to moan. We kissed again as I continued to stroke her clit. She was soaking wet and I could smell the scent of her passion. Her lips had become very thin and were swollen. It was very exciting to know that she desired it as much as I did.</p> <p>“Oh God, I need it,” she moaned.</p> <p>I was very close again so I slowly began to slip my finger up into her tight pussy. This sent a jolt of electricity up to her clit as I pressed it against her. I could feel her body respond strongly to my touch and the sensation was incredible.</p> <p>“Oh yes, I need it,” she said.</p> <p>I pressed my finger deeper into her pussy and touched her gspot—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
