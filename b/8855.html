"Cum baby, let it happen"</p> <p>She starts moaning, "Yes, YES!!" He begins pumping harder, faster, deeper and deeper, her legs begin to quiver and she shakes. She's cuming and cuming, I can hear her and John, "OH, YES!! YES, John, Yes!!" she screams as an orgasm hits!</p> <p>As she subsides and goes to sit up I take a hold on her shoulders and kiss her ear. "I'm going to fuck both those girls up until you are so sore you know you cant walk!" I say and leave the room for the other girl.</p> <p>"Oh honey" I hear her saying over her ear, "I don't think it can get any better!! I will call you when I want to do something."</p> <p>I watch her for a few minutes; I am still a little confused with how I felt and what I experienced. I realize it's because I am still mad with John. I have a new respect for him, so what now?" I ask.</p> <p>I hear Dana, "John never told me how he was able to cum like that."</p> <p>My jaw drops, I look at John, "OH NO!" I scream.</p> <p>"I thought you liked it better if I did" he retorts. "Well, as long as you enjoyed it" I say as I start feeling myself up.</p> <p>"Please leave my pussy alone!" he says sternly. I'm in a bit of a state, this is more than I expected, and I want it. I ask, "Want me to lick it out?"</p> <p>He gets a shocked look on his face and just shakes his head. I continue to rub myself as I watch his eyes and then his hands as they roam. I see those blue eyes, I see it all in his eyes. I continue and rub myself faster and harder. I'm almost there.</p> <p>Then John says, "I've never seen anyone cum like you did in the shower, and I'd have to say my girlfriend's cum doesn't qualify."</p> <p>"Well, that's ok with me" I say, "It's a lot more enjoyable than doing it with someone. So, you better go." I say as I push myself up and back onto him. I ride his fingers and he kisses my neck. He lifts my tit and he gives my nipple a soft bite. I squirm, I squirm, I can't. I can't cum any more now, so I just hold on and let my body be rocked and writhe.</p> <p>He kisses my lips again and again, licks my nipples and I can feel my muscles relax and go limp, I fall asleep again, and am woken up the next morning by John.</p> <p>"What a mess" he says with a sigh</p> <p>"Shit, I think you might have lost control if you didn't come"</p> <p>"I did? I came. Wow, you are so nice" I say as I reach down to feel my wetness. I reach for my glass of lemonade, and he takes it, then he starts putting the glass on the table by the couch and sits with me. "Honey, you are not my first fuck but I'd say the top ten is mine"</p> <p>"It's not that hard it's just easy to lose control. It's also the truth."</p> <p>I take a sip of my lemonade and his body. He isn't lying, this man is one to ride! I reach down to feel his cock. He moans, "I can see you are excited." We talk for hours about our weekend on the beach. I'm not sure, maybe I did mention that? No, its true.</p> <p>We go to the beach, he gets us a cab and we walk around the city. There are so many things we might do together againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
