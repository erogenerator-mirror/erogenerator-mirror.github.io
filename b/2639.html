He rolled her over and kissed her again, this time more passionately. She parted her legs and pressed them into the mattress, encouraging him with her thighs. He pushed himself inside her warm wetness and they both sighed as he filled her.</p> <p>"I want to stay like this forever," he said, reaching up to take her face so he could kiss her again. She wrapped her legs around his hips, pulling him inside her with each thrust. She sighed as he stretched her inside, his cock moving so wonderfully with each movement.</p> <p>When they came together her entire body felt like it was going to explode. Neither of them knew what to do with the other's body, so he pulled out first and rolled her onto her stomach on the bed. Her ass was in the air and she looked back at him with lust-stricken eyes.</p> <p>He was on his knees on the bed, behind her, his cock pointing upwards. She looked back at him, her eyes glazed with lust and desire. He moved to her, taking her by the shoulders and moving her so her breasts were hanging above the pillows. He kissed her on the neck as he entered her.</p> <p>It was so soft and inviting. He could feel her nipples against his chest and he ran his fingers lightly over them. Her moans made him feel good to her. As the tempo increased he began caressing her breasts, sliding his finger into her cleavage. She arched her back to encourage him, and with a deep sigh he leaned to nibble and suckle her neck.</p> <p>Her legs wrapped around him, pulling him in. Her legs were pressed back to the mattress and he moved his hands to the back of her knees, spreading her legs as far as they would go. He looked down at her as she pressed back against him, trying to increase the friction of his cock on her clit. She moved her hands to his shoulders and grabbed them tightly and began working herself up and down his cock. With her eyes closed all she could hear was the soft noises of their bodies moving as one. His moans were driving her crazy, and she knew he was close and that he would reach it before she was ready to begin.</p> <p>She could hear the sound of their bodies slapping together as he fucked her. Her body ached with pleasure and lust with each thrust of his cock. Each of his motions made her quiver with joy. It took every ounce of her strength to not cry aloud as a wave of pleasure surged over her. She pressed her thighs hard against him as the orgasm rolled through her, gripping him inside her. The sounds of their bodies slamming together filled the room and filled the air around them.</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed her again. When she opened her eyes she saw his eyes smoldering with passion and desire.</p> <p>"I'm going to make you feel like that every time I'm with you," she said. She was barely able to bring herself to speak before he picked her up and carried her to the bathroom and washed her off. This time she layed on the cold plastic of the shower, her legs wrapped tightly around him, waiting.</p> <p>She thought they must have been going at it for the next 30 minutes and she thought it had only been a few minutes but the hot water hit her body like an electric charge had been applied. "I like this," she said.</p> <p>He laughed and kissed her again. "I like to fuck you so thoroughly you feel like you're going to be my girl forever," he said. She moaned, and ran her fingers through his hair, her arms pulling his head down as he took one of hers in his hands and kissed her, sucking hard on the other one.</p> <p>One of his hands roamed down her back, his fingers teasing her spine. Her hands pressed against his chest in encouragement. He slowly bent down and his mouth found her right nipple. She gasped as his tongue ran through the thin membrane between the tip of her breast and the valley that he loved to explore the most. His lips sucked at the tip, teasing them with the tip of his tongue. She wanted him in her mouth, ready to suck any part of him with passion. She was ready.</p> <p>With a quick movement he was gone, and she felt his hand run down her stomach, over her navel, before coming to rest on her mound. She could feel the heat of the palm of his hand on her pubic hair. His fingers spread her lips apart like a flower in bloom. She could tell they were soaked from the moisture that was running down over them. He pressed gently against her clit, causing her to shiver as she felt the wetness on her slit.
