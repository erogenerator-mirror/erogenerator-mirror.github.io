We know how sexy I am, even while we're dating. I could always...well, you knew that already, wouldn't you, too?"</p> <p>And before I had the chance to answer her question, the girl slid a hand onto my leg, "I know. I mean, you looked at me...and I...did something naughty too. Do you understand?"</p> <p>I nodded sheepishly, "Yeah, I...it's pretty hot to watch."</p> <p>"Well, I just want to make sure," said the girl. "No promises, just don't touch me. I never said, never made a big deal of things to anyone about it. I just didn't want you looking at me the way I did when we first met, and even then it was just..." Her voice trailed off.</p> <p>The girl took a quick look at her watch. "Well, you can always just say no, but I really think that's the perfect idea. I'm sure you remember the last night I was out with my best friends, and we were talking. You went out a little too, didn't you?" That was kind of funny since it'd been our friends who initiated the discussion.</p> <p>I didn't. I was glad I remembered. And if that wasn't a weirdo at least it seemed to me that there was some kind of a weirdos thing going on.</p> <p>"No. You went out with your best friend, not a sex offender in the woods. Do you think I have a good memory?"</p> <p>The other girl chuckled, "Well, if you're asking me if I recall all your friends, I guess you can say that I do."</p> <p>I nodded at that, before looking down at her, taking a step forward. And that was all the direction I'd been looking at before. "Wait, why are you taking my name?" I asked.</p> <p>The girl didn't stop there. "Because you look in my eyes. We know how long a relationship you've had and we think it's important that you understand that. Don't you think that's good?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I don't see," I said.</p> <p>The girl let go of me and stepped away. "Oh, now that's one fine pussy you're hiding behind that," she scooted a little closer. "I'm going to start right here. You'd better stop looking at me like that, ok?"</p> <p>She had a devilish grin. Without turning around I had an unobstructed view of her right breast, her nipple very hard and a little pink, surrounded by a dark pink areola.</p> <p>"And I want you to know," she continued, "That I'd better be very careful if I were you. You could tell when you were looking at another woman. I'd want you to know if it was because of how sexy a woman you were or because you wanted a hot sex partner that I could seduce you. I'm not a sex offender in any kind of sense. Just you looking at me like that...and to be honest, I just like the way you look at me sometimes."</p> <p>"How do you know?" I asked as I turned my focus on her chest. "Do you know what I was thinking?"</p> <p>"I don't know why," she replied coyly. She stepped closer, touching my arm, almost touching, and I had the sudden realization that she didn't notice my reaction to that. She stepped back. Then she brought her hands up to her hair, pulled it back and pulled it. I watched her fingers move from the nape of her neck to the top of her head, almost touching. She had a mischievous look on her face as she stood there, looking at me and then turned looking down at the sheet. I wondered what she was thinking. I thought she knew why she would be looking at me, but not how she knew.</p> <p>I took in the sight in front of me. All of a sudden she was in front of me, looking at my naked body and touching my arms, my chest and finally I was looking at her breasts, the rest of her body. My cock was hard in my shorts and I'd been rubbing it for what felt like an eternity. She could feel it. She didn't stop but instead started to move her hand up my arm, her fingers lightly brushing against my bicep.</p> <p>She reached one hand up my arm, letting it rest on my shoulder, then she moved her hand to my shoulder and down to my leg. My cock was now as rigid as it had ever been and I felt completely out of my skin. She slowly lifted my arms and then brought them backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
