He held up his hand to stop the smile that filled his mind. "I'm tired. I really need a bath to wash the sweat, the anxiety of running and the stress. I guess we'll have to leave a note tomorrow. We got to have a drink, do you think you can drive?" "You know, you have a point there," she nodded her head in his direction and started out the door, "We could have some fun and enjoy ourselves and not have another wasted day."</p> <p>He followed her and they walked into the bar toward a back room that was not too far from the stairs. They both knew that the place was not as bad as it looked, "I'm sure we can do this."</p> <p>"It's just a dance," he smiled at her and she had to agree. There was no one around so they made their way onto the dance floor and started walking together, "I'm a little slow on the way to the bar, and I don't want to go too quick, and this guy at the bar has really put a damper on the evening. We both like a beer."</p> <p>"I do like another beer, but you have to promise not to run if you want anything." She did her best to remain professional, but even the tone of that conversation was getting to her.</p> <p>"You look like you are ready to run, you're going to get hurt."</p> <p>She thought about it, "Oh sure, that would be nice. Why wouldn't I run? I really want to."</p> <p>"You are doing it on purpose," he laughed, pulling her into a close embrace.</p> <p>She pulled back and looked him straight in the eyes as her hand rested on his chest. "I've wanted to do that ever since we moved here. Thank you so much." His kiss on her mouth lasted a long kiss as two of his fingers went down her back as he pulled her closer and started to rub over her ass.</p> <p>She pulled away and slid to where he was rubbing her ass over her panties. Her legs were still wrapped around his waist and he could feel her thighs on his hard on.</p> <p>He lifted her up and spun her around so that he could slide his pants down around his ankles and she had to hold onto him for support as he slid his pants down to the floor beside her. He had to sit down on the floor, not wanting to fall over, since they were still fully dressed, when he leaned forward and they kissed again as his fingers found their way to her bra strap and pulled it out from under her top. They broke the kiss and she stepped away so he just held her close as he kissed her on the corner of her lower left lip.</p> <p>She could feel the wetness of his breath as he pulled her mouth to his, pressing his mouth against hers softly. Their kissing was long and it took all of a second. All of a second, a long moment of being with him that wasn't forced, of being so physically intimate with someone you love, and that can do almost anything that she wants. He had to put her mind elsewhere as she kissed him back and moved his fingers over her panty clad ass. She knew she could tell the same could be said for his cock as it was already showing signs of a rise growing inside his shorts as he rubbed her. She had to break the kiss so she could step back, and then turn to him, taking him with her as they stood.</p> <p>His mouth touched hers again before kissing down her neckline so slowly and gently that she had to catch her breath. She heard it whisper in her ear as his hand stroked across her breast; she could feel his hardness through his shorts under her fingers that had gone to her bra. As his finger slid over her nipple, she closed her eyes, and shivered involuntarily as his breath hit her ear and she heard his soft moan. He bit her shoulder in his slow motion and she tilted her neck to kiss him as her hips tried to pull in closer to his leg. She didn't want it to end, but had to go slowly.</p> <p>He was right where she wanted him. Her knees had gone weak as her body started to shake as she let go and allowed herself to fall to her back with his hand between them. Her fingers moved to him again as he stood between her legs and started to unbutton his shorts.</p> <p>"No, you have to help." She moved her body so he could pull his shorts and boxers off. She watched his hard member as it sprung out and just seemed as long as her hands. She had thought of touching it for years, but had kept it to herself, since the first time when she had seen it at the wedding of some girlfriends.</p> <p>She had been watching him sinceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
