That it makes all the difference?" I whispered. "We both know it's wrong. I don't need any other men. I don't need you just lying there waiting for me. It makes no difference. You just keep doing what you're doing."</p> <p>"No more talking," she told me. "I'm just doing what's best for you."</p> <p>"I'm just waiting until you can take it. It's like waiting with a dead fish," I grumbled, making her back stop at the edge of the bed.</p> <p>She leaned down toward me and kissed me on the lips, pushing her tongue toward my mouth. The passion started and kept building and then building until one small part of my life went black. I woke up in a hotel room with Jennifer on top of me in one of the private rooms with a woman's head in my lap, sucking on a nipple. I woke up from my coma in a room covered by a sheet. I couldn't move. My hand was inside of her pants, fumbling with her pussy. The woman on top of me smiled at me.</p> <p>"Hello, you can go down on me," she said, turning her head to kiss me again. While I sucked on her tits, I moved my hand inside of her pants and slipped my forefinger inside of her, moving it about. Even as her pussy responded, I still couldn't take my eyes off of her. She reached out and pressed a kiss back to my face. Then she turned back and started kissing me again as she reached down and started taking out my cock. She looked down at my cock as she took it all the way into her throat. The woman on top of me was giving the woman below me great blow jobs. What the hell was I doing? I had no idea. She pulled off my cock with a pop and then looked deep in my eyes.</p> <p>"He's so big," she said, her voice sounding a bit breathless. "You can go down on him."</p> <p>The woman on top of me moved up off of me. She turned around into a 69 position with me laying my head next to hers. When I looked at Jennifer, the woman on top of me had her head between my legs. I watched as her tongue started going to work on my dick while she reached my balls, rubbing them, giving them a gentle squeeze. The woman between my legs was getting even wetter. She looked at me and smiled as she took my hard cock in her mouth. With that, I looked back at Jennifer who was watching us with a mouth full of pussy. I felt my head lift and the woman with her face buried in my bush gave me a few gentle tugs down.</p> <p>"Fuck her pussy with your hard cock," Jennifer urged at me as she got over me, turning around onto all fours, raising her ass a little, waiting impatiently to see who was fucking her and whose ass was licking my balls.</p> <p>"Fuck him," the woman said to Jen with a smile, lowering herself down towards my dick. "Fuck his ass."</p> <p>The woman behind Jennifer's pussy licked her lips with a nod to me and turned her head to watch Jennifer and I fuck the woman. The woman leaned down to watch me again as I drove into the woman's pussy. She looked back while I was fucking her again. I was still looking at Jennifer who was taking my cock again, but watching Jennifer. And watching Jennifer. I got my face back into Jennifer's pussy, enjoying her soft moans as her tongue pressed against her labia and my cock in her mouth. I didn't let up on fucking the woman's ass. I grabbed Jen by the hips and rammed into her again and again and again. She had to hold onto the bed with all her free arm to keep from falling down in the bed. I was pounding into her and Jennifer couldn't keep quiet. I looked at the other woman who was lying on top of her, kissing her ear. I could see her tongue moving on her lips. We stayed going. Jennifer couldn't let go of me. Her hands were still holding on to my hips as I pounded her pussy. I had to hold onto Jennifer's hips and hold her down into the bed. I could feel her nails on my skin as I kissed her lips. Jennifer just gave deep moans.</p> <p>"Please, fuck me," she whispered into my ear. "Fill my pussy with your cum."</p> <p>I was pounding her pussy until I couldn't hold off anymore. My knees gave way and I could feel my cum racing up into her pussy. Jennifer was sucking hard on my cock as I exploded. We both just fell down on each other's bodies. As the waves of pleasure started to subside I looked first to Jennifer, now lying on the bed next to the woman above us, who was still licking her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
