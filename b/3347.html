I'm not sure about the details but I have a feeling we'll know more details when I get there.</p> <p>"A couple of years ago I would go out with a friend - her name was Sally - but I got carried away and we ran into each other outside her home."</p> <p>"How long did it last then?" I asked.</p> <p>"About a month. Our first time together was kind of awkward. We never kissed again, but I guess I was still kind of on the fence since we had already done it once. It seemed like a harmless thing to do."</p> <p>"If she has been honest to you, about you being with her, is there a chance that this could happen again?"</p> <p>"You are such a sweetie..." I smiled.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>When Sally turned 21, her dad would never go out of town on a Saturday. His wife had left him with the kids and was in the army. It was one of those things that we didn't even have time to do. We'd just watch the TV, take off, and go somewhere else. My mom got divorced, and the kids stayed at the grandparents' to spend some time with the grandparents' and they would stay over. Her dad was in prison, with his wife in prison, and his two kids would have time for a few weeks before starting to move on to something else. I was in the military, but I stayed home, which was good for me and the kids, and I would stay out of the way.</p> <p>My mom had two kids now and there was nothing to see or do so it was hard for me to even think about spending time apart.</p> <p>Sally was different. She didn't have any idea about our relationship. For one thing, she didn't give me any kind of attention. For two she seemed to be less concerned about what her kids would do and she seemed to avoid social activities. For the most part she seemed to be alone or sleeping all through the week. In other words, she was just hanging out. No dating, no parties, nothing, I guess it all seemed like she was just hanging there, and I didn't notice because I was pretty much a stranger to her.</p> <p>My sister, Sally, was a big girl and was popular. She was about five foot four, and very athletic, with long blonde hair that hung down to the middle of her back. She had a very sweet personality and a great sense of humor. She was actually a very nice person and I had always been attracted to her. However, in the past I had been just too much of a geek for her.</p> <p>"Sally's having sex with the guy she's with," I remember her saying, after a while.</p> <p>"What?" I was shocked.</p> <p>"You're not hearing this, are you?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, I-I think it's the same guy." I answered.</p> <p>"I don't care. I'm all yours now. Just know that you'll always feel special, even if you won't feel anything for a guy." Sally said softly and then she giggled. Her first words that night were 'he better be worth sticking something into me when I die' as the tears began to roll down her face.</p> <p>"It's not that he doesn't have sex with women," she said, "he just doesn't, right?"</p> <p>"Yes, he does," I said quietly. I couldn't believe that I was listening to her, but I didn't want to think about her not being all that good in bed. So I just listened and nodded my head. She giggled again.</p> <p>"That he does. He never gets tired of hearing it. I can see it when he has me over to his house. He goes to bed at a time the second he goes back to work."</p> <p>Sally laughed again, but this time it sounded serious and she was serious. She put down the receiver after that, and said, "He has to be on his best behavior. Even if I give him head, I would never cheat on him. He's a nice guy and he knows how to treat a girl properly. In the meantime, I'll just have to watch him a lot. He's such a sweetie. Anytime you need a little help, I'm on my way." Then she giggled again and she was gone with a long sigh.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Sally, I think, was like that with the group of guys. She wanted to be extra special in that way of hers and we wanted to help her with the rest of it. We always had the urge to be extra special in a way I couldn't even imagine.</p> <p>I couldn't get her out of my mind. I'm not sure she liked the idea ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
