As he held her in his arms, it felt like a giant weight fell off his shoulders and into the bed. His heart was beating faster and faster and his cock was throbbing and throbbing and begging to get inside her. He just couldn't stop himself. He couldn't even help himself. All he could think about was how wonderful it was to kiss her and how hot she looked. He kissed her mouth a lot, and he kissed her a lot, and he kissed her neck and chest and ears and back. He even kissed her asshole and she just smiled a lot and kissed his lips. She liked having so much control over him. He had never liked being in charge, but he liked it more and he got more and more passionate over it. And he couldn't seem to get enough of her.</p> <p>And he knew he was going to end it. The thought of finishing what she had started was so exciting, so intense, and so, so wonderful, that even though all of this had been going on for what felt like a long time, it was also such a long time and a part of him just wanted to keep going. And that's what had happened. He wanted to fuck her tonight, and there was no going back. The sex would be all over the house by nightfall tomorrow.</p> <p>But the sex had been better. She was so hot, she got so sexy in spite of it all. He felt like she really knew how to make love. He really liked being on top because with him lying down he had to be on top. He was just starting to feel a little self conscious about it, but there was no such thing as self conscious about it anymore. The way things normally were in the bedroom, the difference between them was that even after having all these little love sessions and then with her having her little orgasms and his cumming in her, everything would be in the right place tomorrow. She would get all her satisfaction, and it would be like he did, but she would still enjoy it, too, and she would have her own little love session in the morning when she got up. And they had even had lunch together, she had had lunch in the morning and they had had sex together, and he had eaten hers and swallowed hers.</p> <p>That was how it happened all over again in this very same bed. Maybe every time they went back to the hotel, his wife, this same young lady with the nice breasts, the tight round ass, and the long, lean legs of his wife, they were out in the country, out in the country in his bed, in his arms, in his bed. Or some woman who had just bought herself a diamond pendant, the necklace his wife was wearing, and she had paid the woman to put it on her neck. It seemed like just her and her friend fucking. Even their friends who were all naked, with her in nothing but the peter ring, their little diamonds, were fucking each other. She didn't need to be naked. She just lay there on the bed, she had the peter, but he had bought her diamonds. And she had a peter in her pussy, and he had bought her a little gold chain necklace. He had even added a tiny gold pendant to replace it with her peter ring. It seemed like just a little gold pendant, but actually it was almost more than that for her pussy. Her pussy, though, she was his little pink Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy PeePeePee Pussy PeePee Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy PeePee Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy.</p> <p>That afternoon in a hotel room the very first time he had held his little Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pee was his first time, and he would remember it over and over again. It had been the greatest time of his life. It had always been the first time he had actually had a Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy, something he had been told many times but never had done before.</p> <p>After kissing and lying on the bed afterwards at the hotel's restaurant where they were going to get lunch, they had both been so excited that they almost lost it and were so happy when he had finally fucked her. They were talking for hours, and both of them had become a bit of a thing, a couple of different women, a young woman who needed the right man now. After fucking each other, while kissing her and feeling her up at the same time, they would sometimes go out dancing and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
