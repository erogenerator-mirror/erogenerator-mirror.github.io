"You just said 'I'll kill him.'" This was an understatement, since she wasn't really going to do it. "Get up and put those pants on."</p> <p>Oh, did I mention she was wearing her new heels? "What's with the heels?" I asked.</p> <p>She gave me a sly smile. "Just you wait." And she got up, turned the key in the lock and stepped out of the room. I followed, just like she'd asked. It didn't take long. The elevator was full, and she pressed a button for "9" along with a small red light. We reached the ground floor and she pointed to a door at the side of the room. "There's a couch in here." She led us to the couch, which had a small coffee table, along one wall. She laid back to rest on the couch, with a pillow next to her head.</p> <p>I sat down next to her with a smirk. "So what did you have in mind for tonight's entertainment?" she asked. "I'll go ahead and set it up." I couldn't help myself. She wasn't giving me permission. "But it won't have anything to do with you, but you'll have to give me the right to come in here without getting out myself."</p> <p>I didn't even try to stop her. I just sat there, trying to keep from jumping into that pillow. And trying to get it out of my sight. "Come on," she commanded. "Do it." So I did. "Well," she said, "I'm still not sure what you want from me right now, but I can tell you now, I'm going to have fun!"</p> <p>I was beginning to get into it, and I was starting to get that feeling of having this woman in control. This girl just decided not to let me touch her, let alone make love to her, for fear of making me get the wrong direction. She just knew there was no turning back now. And this time, it was a real turn-on. I could see she was already wet, and that wetness was beginning to drip through the thin material that barely covered her pussy. Her nipples were rock-hard beneath her lace bra and a little more so. I could see her juices on her outer lips, and I could see the small outline of a little bud that was already glistening in the light.</p> <p>"Okay, you go first," she said, "I want you to strip." I hesitated. There is no "first" game in this game. The game is just about making you get the hell away from the woman you've just seen pleasuring herself.</p> <p>I started at the beginning. First I went over every nook and cranny of her body in the most graphic way possible. I felt her stomach, ass, thighs and calves. I felt her breath on my face, or in my mouth. My hands moved down her body, feeling the outline of her ribs and her navel. Her legs were smooth and long. Her skin was smooth and soft, like a second skin. Her pussy was trimmed. Her lips glistened in the bright light. I found myself taking my time, memorizing what I would do next. A few seconds later, I kissed her on the thigh, just barely grazing the skin. Her eyes had a fire in them that was intense and alive. She moaned softly, but not in pleasure, she was in control now.</p> <p>"Turn around," she said, turning so I was facing her. I did so and she reached up and pulled my shirt up and off of me. As much as I hated it, there was a sexual charge in having this woman looking at me. She knelt down in front of me and started to undo the buttons on my pants. And just as quickly, I started to protest.</p> <p>"No." I whispered to her. She stopped.</p> <p>"No?" she asked, clearly taken aback. I nodded to her in compliance. And she dropped my pants to the ground, leaving me only in my briefs. She took them off, and put them on the clothes pile and walked towards me.</p> <p>"Get dressed!" she barked, and then she threw some clothes at me on top and told me to put on the clothes pile. When I sat down at my desk, she told me to undress, and then she picked up her panties.</p> <p>"Now you," she said as she pulled a pair of her stockings up to her thigh, "you better not have any more sex before we get to this game."</p> <p>"What...what are you trying to...?" I asked, shocked.</p> <p>"Are you kidding me?" she asked. "Just as I've said, we're just a normal guy pairâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
