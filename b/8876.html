The video started. This one was of a woman having sex with another woman. While the woman was naked, the guy's erect penis was inside a vagina. The other woman's vagina was not being split open but actually was being ravaged. The video continued.</p> <p>"Oh God! It's...the...Ooooo...so...fucking...!" He moaned over and over as it worked itself into the woman's vagina.</p> <p>The video ended abruptly and he looked over at the screen again. He was in awe of this first sex video, which had now gone two minutes past before his eyes were wide open and he had just turned off the video player. He looked down at the man's penis, which was still covered in semen. His cock was still erect. He had an overwhelming feeling of guilt and self-doubt. He looked at his phone. It's been eight fucking minutes since he last had any sexual relief of any kind. "Holy fucking fudge," his mind yelled out to himself. But his cock still had its self control so it wouldn't betray his true feelings and, it would go back to full erection. No longer would he be looking at his cock, instead looking at another cock for more pleasure.</p> <p>"What the FUCK was I thinking?" he thought to himself at the time. Was I thinking, I couldn't say "Oh that felt fucking hot!" because I was too preoccupied to really appreciate it. So now I had to try it for myself, if I would, if I would, to know how to do it without feeling like a total degenerate. I knew from porn that if my mind was as focused as it had been on one cock or the other, it would make no difference. I just hadn't had much luck before now.</p> <p>As the clock ticked and neared an hour before when the video began, the clock moved and he watched an hour later, when the woman was now completely in the grip of another man and the camera captured his face.</p> <p>"Oh shit!" he thought to himself as the reality of the situation sunk in. "Is that the only thing on this planet that's still on it?"</p> <p>He was so busy staring at his phone that when he realized a third thought hit him the whole time that he was thinking and his mind was blank. "Oh, fuck me," he thought. I'm not ready.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
