He needed something.</p> <p>She pushed down his head, leaving it lying where she had left it. She felt him move, she felt him begin to move.</p> <p>"I'm not really into this", he finally whispered to her, "I've never done this before, I've always just kind of..."</p> <p>"It is different", she assured him. "Let's just let it come naturally"</p> <p>She slid down the bed again, moving her thighs down his body, kneeling upright, she reached behind and undid his cuffs and began to massage his shoulders before lying down fully with him -</p> <p>"You don't mind if we do this together? We just want to do this properly", he said into her ear. "I can't ask so many girls, you are so..."</p> <p>"I don't mean to pry, it's so nice to feel you beside me". The words were lost to her lips as they left her body, now lying back on the bed, she looked at him.</p> <p>"So you think I should give you a...a demonstration on how I'm going to be good - what I can and can't say in those videos I'm offering you" she said, her smile broadening. "And you just need me to be good with you!"</p> <p>He rolled onto his back, pushing up his waistband, he was hard for her, for her all the time, but for a moment...</p> <p>"It's all right", she said, and she crawled over his body, slowly, teasingly, she had a lot of thinking to do - and a lot more to see...</p> <p>She moved up along the bed, taking the pillows she had placed at the edge, then her body moved to lay between his legs. She moved his hands above his head, she looked down at him.</p> <p>"I know you're not a big-time porn producer, you don't mind giving me everything I want do you? I love to see you doing me. But now I've got better things to do for you", she smiled as she started to lay her body down on top of his. She lowered her hips, pressing her pussy lips to his head of his penis, she pressed the lips of her pussy to his shaft, she felt it, he was hard for her, she felt herself.</p> <p>"You're so hard, and so warm and so thick," she said. She smiled again, and rubbed her nipples on his chest, she smiled. "Mmm, what has got into you? If I might say, you are so very hard too. What's this?"</p> <p>"Its...it's a part of me", he replied, "let it be in me, you want it, I do!" she smiled, her arms around his waist. She moved herself over his body, the bedding between them, his cock in her, she smiled, she knew he wanted to, she knew he couldn't,</p> <p>She moved on his face, her hand sliding her pussy towards his mouth. "Don't waste this," she said. "I know what I want and what I want you to do with it. Open wide! Now!" and she spread her hips, she pushed her body down on his, feeling the softness of her pussy against his lips.</p> <p>After a few moments she pulled back and lay with him on the bed, she looked at him again. Her body moved back and forward, her head on his chest, she moved her body over his, he held his cock in his hand, she rubbed herself against it, it was warm and moist! "I want this, it's you, it's everything you want, your cock, I want your hands on it, you need it" she whispered.</p> <p>She lowered herself onto his body, her hands still moving around his cock, she slowly moved her body down his, her thighs brushing into his stomach as she reached the end of his cock.</p> <p>"I've wanted you for so long now, now we'll be together. Hold on tight, hold on, hold on".</p> <p>She felt herself fall onto his hips and she pressed, feeling the tip of the huge penis, as she felt herself moving from the end of his cock to his hip, she could feel it pressing against the bottom of her pussy lips.</p> <p>She held herself there for a moment, feeling his body and the warmth under her fingers. She looked down, felt his hips move. She looked as his erection moved between her thighs.</p> <p>"Mmmmm" she felt and felt, "Mmmmmmm", she sighed feeling his hips move,</p> <p>She could still feel his hands on her waist, the pressure on her body, she smiled as she rubbed herself against him, felt herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
