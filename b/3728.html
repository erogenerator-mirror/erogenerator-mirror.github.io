I hope the water and stuff don't get me in trouble."</p> <p>"Honey, I think I'm all right and if the water is okay I'm going to go to bed. I will be right back and I'll let you know what happened." He gave her a kiss and went up to wash up.</p> <p>It took her a second but when she came out of the bedroom she found she had a blanket over them.</p> <p>"It's okay, mom. I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too." She had heard about that in some of those old romance books but none of it made any sense so she felt safe. He had no reason to say they loved each other and she figured it didn't matter to him either because she knew it was all right. He had always been a good parent and he had never once raised his hand to her. Not that it was really that big a deal. If anything it probably just added fuel to the fire.</p> <p>"That was a good kiss. I can hardly believe I kissed you and felt you respond to me." He had said it with such certainty she felt like she could just melt to him. She just shook her head no as she looked into his eyes and they fell into one another's. She felt so stupid. He was all right with everything that she had done and even the way she had let him do it. She had always loved him and wanted him. She had never felt that she loved him. She really didn't. It was all a misunderstanding of a long lost dream.</p> <p>"You're still so hard." The smile was back as he turned and headed for the bathroom. He grabbed the towels and she saw his erection. She tried to cover it so he wouldn't notice how wet and soft it was. He was going to use the cold stuff or just stick it in her mouth.</p> <p>"Sorry. I got carried away so I'll need to take care of this with my tongue." He used both hands and lifted her towel and began to lick her slowly. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the sensations. He teased her lips and slowly slid up to her clit. Her hips made a little bucking noise which he licked again and her hips made a little movement of their own. Soon he had the whole of her clit in his mouth and when he did just the tip on her spot he felt her clench around his tongue. That's when he got a taste of her. Her juice was delicious and he savored their tanginess as he tasted it for himself. Just for fun he took a finger in his mouth and brought it to her pussy. She was already sopping wet. He started fingering her as he licked her. He teased her by sucking on her clit and then licking it until she was writhing. He kept up his teasing for a while then inserted his finger in her pussy. She was so wet she nearly came right there. She came to as he slipped a piece of paper across his tongue while sucking on her clit. He smiled as he pulled his finger out and replaced it with his tongue. He started to tongue fuck her as she moaned louder. It was music in his ears and made him crazy with need. He kept eating her until her hips started to buck wildly.</p> <p>Her hips had grabbed his tongue and she held it like she was riding a bucking bronco. Her legs went taut. She just sat there still holding him by his head and just moaning into him. Finally, her hips seemed to relax and finally she relaxed. He took this as an opportunity to get up off of her. She had her eyes closed in sheer horror.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." She managed as she opened her eyes.</p> <p>"Thank you, dear." He stroked her hair and told her he wanted to do it again soon. She smiled as she closed her eyes a bit and gave him a soft kiss on the lips.</p> <p>"Mom." She said as she took the towel off. It was dripping. "You have to use a bath when you shower. And you have to finish your shower before you go to bed." She handed him the towel and started to rub her hair. He dried himself off and went down the hall to wash his hair.</p> <p>"You're not mad at me for kissing my son?"</p> <p>"Not for a while now."</p> <p>"No mom. I meant that you can kiss me whenever and if you want to."</p> <p>"Don't you want to kiss the first time we make love again?"</p> <p>"That I do."</p> <p>"Do you want to keep going tomorrow?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She reached for him but he held up a finger for her to stop him. She wanted him to tell her that what he wanted to do today was over and she wanted it to stay that way with himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
