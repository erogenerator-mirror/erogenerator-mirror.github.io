He motioned over to the hallway where a woman was still standing waiting to use the next door. She was a knockout, she was of slim build, with long straight black hair down near her shoulders, a very beautiful face, long legs. A very pretty face.</p> <p>"Well," he said, as he walked by her heading for the door. She stopped in front of a large wooden table, "I'm sure that we could get some lunch. We have a bit of a problem."</p> <p>He was still walking away and she took this time to admire his perfect ass all of a sudden. He looked back over his shoulder at her questioningly.</p> <p>"Is everything ok?" she teased, "do people go naked here?"</p> <p>"Well, no, I didn't just say that, this is a part of the hotel."</p> <p>"A part of the hotel?" she asked with a giggle.</p> <p>"Yes, but what about you?" he said, "have you enjoyed your stay?"</p> <p>She turned around with what he thought was a slight smile and replied, "Yes, I have, I was actually looking forward to it, not only with the company but the company of my own family I was actually looking forward to, especially since I was also going to be staying with a friend for a long time."</p> <p>"I'm glad to hear that." The two of them sat down on the sofa and resumed their conversation.</p> <p>About this time her name plate was showing another woman, "Dixie. Dixie, this is my friend and business associate, Wendy." As she was introducing the young lady, she was looking directly at the young woman and Wendy, it appeared that was having the same difficulty as Dixie.</p> <p>"Why are you both here?" the young lady asked the two women at the table holding her cell phone. The young lady was blushing a bit and looked at the young lady in shock.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, that wasn't easy for me, what is there to say." The young woman replied honestly. The girls were still chatting and Dixie seemed to be blushing a bit as she spoke.</p> <p>"I'm sure it's understandable, but it is just that it's been a long time since the two of you were here when we were all here together and you seem to be doing a pretty good job making time."</p> <p>"That's my daughter that just happened to have me all worked up, I'm so sorry." she offered. Dixie then looked towards the young woman. She had just finished speaking and seemed nervous.</p> <p>"Well, I wasn't doing too badly were you, I might have made a mistake that would have been much bigger." Wendy looked at the blonde and was about to argue with her when the young lady finally spoke up.</p> <p>"My daughter sure did make me worry."</p> <p>"So am I going to be responsible for all the things you're going to be doing now?" she asked looking right at the young man, the look she was giving him was quite intense now.</p> <p>"No no no, that's ok, Wendy's family's all going to work here while I'm here. You and I are going to be just friends." She reached up and placed the two things she wanted on the table and sat back down. The young woman then leaned over into the young mans ear and whispered "You won't forget that I am no longer married and if anything happens, I wouldn't mind helping you clean up a bit." With that she gave him a cheeky grin and went back to her conversation. As the young women and the young men were sitting in their chairs in an area of the room where there wasn't anyone there, the young woman walked over to the young man, the young man was about to protest, but something in her tone and tone caught him and he slowly looked down at the floor.</p> <p>"Don't be worried," she said as she placed a finger on his cheek, "I don't think they're getting away with being a little bit mean." As she put her arm around the front of his neck she gave him a quick kiss. He looked up at her with his eyes wide and her eyes closed and a smile was forming on his lips.</p> <p>"How about we let the young lady work on that issue, she's going to do a fine job." He took a deep breath and relaxed a bit.</p> <p>Dixie then put a hand on his arm and with a little bit of a push her chair went back a bit. "Ok, I'll go and help your daughter with the dishes thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
