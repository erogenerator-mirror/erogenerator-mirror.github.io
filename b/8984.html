We settled on a beach. I got her another glass and we headed for the beach. We had already packed to a suitcase, though. I did my best to keep my eyes open, and I was beginning to look forward to some interesting times with her.</p> <p>We had a light dinner, and then she said, "Why don't you get undressed. We'll watch TV together. You can do the dishes." I got undressed and sat beside her on the sofa. She went to the kitchen and came back with a tray with the drinks on it. I sipped and then pulled her up on the ottoman.</p> <p>With my foot on the floor we started kissing. I could feel her breasts against my chest, and I ran my hands all over her and found her nipples. She moaned as I teased them and it was a pleasure to take her as deeply as possible. She was completely under my control as we continued this delightful adventure.</p> <p>I broke the kiss and looked deep into her eyes. "You are so beautiful, you know? You don't mind if I take off your shirt, too?" She shook her head no. "Mmm." I put my hands over her breasts and squeezed lightly. Now she was breathing heavy and I knew she was responding to things that I didn't fully understand.</p> <p>I moved my hand to her hips to pull her closer. We kept kissing and breathing in time to the music. My cock was on full alert now, as I caressed her tits and she ground her hips into the side of my leg. I pulled away from the kiss and kissed her neck then moved my mouth from her neck down to her shoulders. I started to move downward, kissing her collarbone now. I reached my hands around and slowly undid one button, exposing one of her hard nipples. I kissed it lightly and continued downward.</p> <p>"Let's get that skirt off," I said softly so she might hear. I got it off, then turned her slightly toward me. I leaned over and continued kissing her from her neck with one leg bent at the knee and the other foot on the ottoman. Then I slid my hands up her waist and started kissing her stomach. I slid them around to her sides in a clockwise direction, and gradually moved my hands to the hemline.</p> <p>"I can't take this, I'm going to make love to you now," I said as I pulled off her blouse. Her breasts are large, almost as big as Kelly's I thought, and a natural shade of pink to match her nipples. I moved my mouth to her boobs and she arched her back as my mouth met her skin. Her taste was as sweet as any I had ever tasted. I moved my mouth slowly from her breasts down across her stomach to her pussy. This is nothing like the first time I had tasted Kelly, or any of her other female lovers. It does not do her justice.</p> <p>"Oh, God, do that, do that," she moaned. I looked up at her and noticed her eyes were closed, and she had her legs spread wide. I took off my pants and went to work with my tongue. She was so wet I didn't have to use any of the lube that I had lubed her up earlier in the day. I licked her lips as I opened my mouth and let her come in. That is why most women don't like to have their pussy lips sucked. When she was done I would pull her clit into my mouth and bite it lightly. This always makes her yelp but she knows it feels good. Since I had made love to her a little bit, I had to admit to her that she had a very good taste, too.</p> <p>The way she liked that I used my hands to spread her pussy lips apart and licked her pussy with the flat of my tongue. She had an incredible aroma I thought. All her nubbin was exposed and I was licking them in and around them. I ran a tongue up and down them again and her legs were shuddering and she lifted them up onto my shoulders. I sucked and nibbled them and then I pulled them down and licked her clit as it peaked out from its hiding place. She tasted better than anyone I had ever known.</p> <p>"Oh, God ...Oh, God ...Eat me, fuck me, do it to me, eat me" she said in a muffled voice. I pushed her legs back into my head and licked all around her clit and pussy lips. She had a slight trembling coming from her movements. I pushed her legs back into her chest, her feet were off the ottoman on the other side of itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
