"Well, not exactly right. But they are going to let you come in with us today."</p> <p>"It's all planned."</p> <p>"Good. Now just relax."</p> <p>"What's going... there?"</p> <p>"Just relax," he said, and the girl nodded and let go a shuddering sigh. David took a deep breath and the girl closed her eyes as if she were asleep, and then let herself fall to the floor.</p> <p>David sat down on the futon between the girls, and after a moment or two he stood up, and looked at her.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Yeah..."</p> <p>"Are you sure you wanna do this," said David.</p> <p>"It's just, you are too good," she muttered.</p> <p>"Don't worry, it will be great."</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>David and Sarah drove past a local bar, then parked up in an old two-story brick shanty, the one next the pool.
