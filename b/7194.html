My arms were sore, but I thought it was a good ending to a pretty nice evening. I don't know what came over me. I looked at the girls and asked "Who were we?"</p> <p>"We are the girls from the movie theater. They have never been with a man; we are the boys from the hotel. We are the girls who have never been with a man."</p> <p>The two girls took each of my arms, and said "Now we are together."</p> <p>We kissed and hugged and said goodbye.</p> <p>"What do I call you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Your name isn't necessary. You will do that on your own. You will call me Sondra?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes, Sondra."</p> <p>I said it with my last breath as I was beginning to feel dizzy. After a few moments, I was able to stand. I had never been so happy in my life. Even though I had never been with any man besides Linda, I had no doubts what it did to me. I had a wonderful experience, which I would never forget.</p> <p>As I was walking up the stairs to our room, I felt so relaxed and content. Linda and Sondra were happy. I felt good when Sondra told me that "I have known Linda for over two years. Even now, her husband and I are not only dating, but fucking in the same room. She didn't tell me that either."</p> <p>Linda and Sondra kissed me on the cheeks then, and said they would be out the first thing tomorrow. I could not have done more then kiss or hug them.</p> <p>The next morning, we got up and had breakfast in bed and made love every night for three or four nights. I really loved it.</p> <p>Afterward, we went out and had a coffee. We had only gotten home from the airport about 20 minutes before the next train that would take us to Seattle.</p> <p>"That man who was in my film theater had to walk the aisle from the theater to see his date," Linda said, "that was very sad because he wished to have a picture of me but we didn't have time to make the drive. I am sorry that he would have had to stand in the aisle to witness me making love to my date."</p> <p>"He had to stand at the altar," Sondra said.</p> <p>I told Linda that it really happened because he would be going to bed with one of the girls from the movie theater. They both had very expressive eyes when they saw me making love to their date. Sondra asked "Do you get off just watching?"</p> <p>"A little," I said.</p> <p>We all got down to the same level of exhaustion.</p> <p>It was just before noon.</p> <p>My first day of class was the hardest. It was difficult to concentrate on any other classes that I had that week. I just could not put a hand on all the girls. I felt so guilty about what had happened. Then, all of a sudden, it hit me.</p> <p>"Oh my God," I thought. "This is my teacher, Sondra." I suddenly felt very embarrassed, which I had never done before.</p> <p>I had also felt ashamed. It was the first time that I had ever felt that way about a woman. Sondra's looks and body were always the center of my thoughts. I even thought that her breasts would be too small to be a real cone. She was so beautiful that I saw the way she smiled every time she went to class, when she stopped short from doing just that.</p> <p>Finally, it was time to get out of there. All of the other teachers were doing the same thing I had the other week, and I felt very foolish, that I should feel so inferior to Sondra, compared to her.</p> <p>After class, we went to the ladies room and we washed the tears that the other girls in the department had shed. We made love all the way in the bathroom, even trying the walkway before we could get out of the stall.</p> <p>"Linda, are you hungry?" Sondra asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered.</p> <p>"What do you want?" she asked.</p> <p>"I want to see your picture," I said.</p> <p>"I'll take that," she said.</p> <p>I showed her the picture I had taken of the other girl and told her how beautiful she was. She said, "I like that too."</p> <p>The next day was the last day of school. We walked the campus and then I walked down the street to my house. When we arrived home, we walkedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
