When I opened my eyes again, I saw that the girl sitting next to me had her head resting on my lap, but her eyes were closed. We had one more drink and she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek. We walked to the parking lot, which was almost deserted. She had no problem parking on the other side, but to get there in about twenty-five minutes I was very aware of her breathing. Even my eyes were focused on that wonderful, warm, moist skin. As we approached the truck, she leaned over and kissed me as we pulled out and stopped. As soon as the truck started to move I pulled down my shorts, which were now soaked with the juice of our escapades, and she got in. We had just got out of the cab when the truck hit my leg. I immediately raised my leg, just enough that she could slide in, but my leg pulled the truck into the back.</p> <p>"You're not staying," I said.</p> <p>"I have another boyfriend," she replied. "And besides; I need to be alone to think about all the sex. My boyfriend is a bit of a drama queen."</p> <p>"You're not drama queen anymore. Besides, it's your choice. I just figured we can skip it."</p> <p>After we had driven over to the cabin, I helped her up the steps, then went around and opened her door. I pushed her down into the car seat and started the engine. "I will get out after I do some work," she said. "Take a swim and get cleaned up before you go up to your room." That was one thing I like about her. We had a very relaxed and sexually charged marriage.</p> <p>In her bedroom, I stripped and went and got a hot, wet washcloth, which I placed on the nightstand, and began to wash her back. When I got to her shoulders that were exposed, I bent down and gently kissed each one. Then I went lower until I had gotten to one of her breasts. I used the cool cloth to wash and knead each breast. When I was finished, I lifted and moved to the other one, and repeated the process until she was moaning softly and arching her body toward me. Once I had finished her shoulders and breasts, I moved down to her legs and soaped them, which she spread more as the water washed the soap away.</p> <p>When I got back to the end of her legs, I could see that she was soaking wet. As she spread her legs wide, I moved so I could get into position, between her thighs, to wash her vagina. By the time I had done that, her clitoris was peeking out from under its hood as she leaned forward toward me, her nipples clearly erect. I lathered up two fingers and began to gently penetrate her vagina, while at the same time rubbing her clitoris with my thumb. She started pushing against me.</p> <p>"OK," she cried. "Now it's yours."</p> <p>I didn't waste any time. I slid my penis into her as she lifted the back of her head and thrust her breast into the water. She grabbed me hard and lifted me all the way into her. She began to rotate her hips, and I put my hands around her bottom and pulled her toward me. She went wild, thrusting with each thrust, which I knew was going the exact same way. It had to be the most intense orgasm she had ever had. Then I felt, rather than heard, how she screamed. The orgasm had come with one huge orgasm. It was just what I needed to hear.</p> <p>When she was spent, I slid out. She turned her head to face me, and kissed me softly, as we embraced. When she stood, her wetness ran down her legs. Then she smiled and left the shower, then left for her room.</p> <p>I looked at the clock, which read 3:25 p.m. on a Sunday. I went in to check out in a few hours, although I had had one too many drinks. I felt like a complete man, so I picked up my suit and headed out. It looked as though I had to walk a couple hundred feet to the restaurant. I was glad I had taken my time because it gave someone a chance to take a look at my legs.</p> <p>I arrived at the restaurant about 15 minutes before the 4:30 p.m. clock. I got to the table just as the server came on. "Good afternoon," she said. "Would you like a drink, sir?"</p> <p>The server looked up at me, and said, "Yes, please." With that, she walked away.</p> <p>"May I order now?" I asked.</p> <p>"We'll see."</p> <p>As soon as the serverâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
