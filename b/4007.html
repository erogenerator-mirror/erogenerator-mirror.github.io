When he broke off his kiss I was staring down at his broad shoulders and his strong jaw. His hair framed the rest of his handsome face making him look like a Hollywood star.</p> <p>After we had kissed several more times, he led me into my suite. We undressed quickly and I was left standing in my sheer panties and my pink lace bra.</p> <p>He knelt between my legs and slowly lowered me to the floor and his mouth engulfed mine as his hands started to rub over my breasts. "That feels so good," he whispered into my mouth. We continued kissing while he sucked on both nipples. He licked it, sucked on it and then bit my hard little pink nub. One hand continued rubbing over and between my legs while I was moaning softly every time he rubbed over. As he kissed him between my legs, his hand moved down and played with my clitoris. I was wet already and I let my legs fall open with him kneeling between them.</p> <p>I was trembling as he sucked on my clitoris and played with my love bud while I tried to suck his finger or even his cock into my mouth. He finally pulled away and sat down on the edge of my bed as his fingers returned to my wet and swollen vagina. I was breathing deeply as he fingered my vagina with two fingers, then three as he pressed hard on my G spot. I was surprised that my body could take his big fat fingers to the depths of the deep pink passage and I was surprised that it felt so good.</p> <p>He pulled his fingers out to my lips and told me that I had not tasted as good, nor would I find them to be of any kind. He then climbed back on the bed and gently pushed inside of me while I felt my first orgasm on the way. Once I got used to his size he was in perfect rhythm to his thrusts, making my juices seep down his hand.</p> <p>When he reached up to suckle on the nipple of my breast he did so with such passion that he made my own nipples become hard little pebbles. When he started to nibble and kiss and tug on them my orgasms went on and on! That is until I felt his tongue lick across the pink lips of my vagina.</p> <p>My body trembled and my hands were on his head trying to pull him into me while he worked his way around from my breasts to the swollen bud of my clitoris. I cried out and came in his mouth like he would have done when my father and I masturbated the night before. As the first tremors of orgasm rolled over my body his tongue and fingers worked in tandem on my clitoris. It didn't take long for me to feel like I was going to cum again and I was. I moaned loudly and let loose a huge load of my juices. He drank them down without missing a beat. When he had finished he smiled at me and crawled up over my thighs and kissed me with all my juices smeared over his lips in the dim light of my bedroom.</p> <p>It seemed like forever before I heard him snore. My hands were still on his hair and gently ran my fingers through it. I felt my wet and exhausted body move and lay there on the bed in the dim light. I tried to catch my breath but was just beginning to fall asleep when he snored gently. I heard him say something then he was gone. When I finally opened my eyes I was startled to see that he was gone again. I got up and went to the mirror to see his face. He had the happiest smile on his face.</p> <p>"You're tired, are you?" I said as I put on my robe and walked out of my bedroom.</p> <p>"I was having such a great time. I was afraid that we were going back to the man-chamber again. I can't believe I just came here. I'm going back to my room!" he replied.</p> <p>I was not surprised and I didn't want to leave him. I took him by the hand and walked back down to the bedroom. In the dim light I could tell that he had been asleep. I wanted to stay in bed, but I had to find myself a way to get him back in the arms of his friend. What is it that he has done to me to make me feel so vulnerable and so alive again? I didn't want to see him again, but I had to!</p> <p>I walked back into my bedroom holding his hand that he held when we went out. "I'm sorry to wake you, Michael, but I am feeling better and I have something to say to you. Don't you ever give up hope," I said as I walked to the bed and laid down on the bed next to him.</p> <p>"I don't think that I would ever give my lifeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
