I wanted to hug her. "I just never thought that would happen so soon."</p> <p>She stood up and looked directly at me, her big brown eyes looking a little worried. She took my hand and we slowly walked towards the bedroom.</p> <p>"It's fine," she started. "You don't have to. I am okay. I wanted to do this. I just wanted to be with you and I didn't want to scare you. We should still be friends."</p> <p>"Okay," I replied. "We can take care of this."</p> <p>It felt to me that she didn't have a plan. I would have her move out. I would leave her alone for now.</p> <p>"I guess you feel that way a lot," she said. She had a smile to go with her voice when she spoke her mind.</p> <p>She came up behind me. Our naked bodies pressed against each other. My arms around me, her hands on my back, mine still stroking her bare bottom. She slowly turned around and faced me, her arms around my neck, arms at her sides. "It feels different this way."</p> <p>Her hips were sliding up and down as she leaned in for a kiss. Her long dark brown hair was sliding over her shoulders. I kissed her nose and finally kissed her lips slowly again.</p> <p>I felt her hands on my shoulders as we kissed. I pulled her closer and she ground her body against mine. I kissed her lips again. She parted her lips and our tongues met. Her tongue darted into my mouth. Our breathing was deep and short. The room was filling with our saliva and the sound of our panting. I reached my hand around her and up to the underside of her breast.</p> <p>She stopped kissing me and pulled away. We stood there for a while; looking at each other.</p> <p>"That was nice," she said. "I really really want to do this."</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied as I stood and helped her move closer to the bed. "I just hope this doesn't hurt anyone."</p> <p>"No, that's fine, it's just a little sensitive." She leaned down and kissed me. It was different feeling her mouth touch mine. I wrapped my arms around her waist as she pulled me down towards her.</p> <p>I felt her long fingers slide between my legs and under my shorts. She traced the head of my hard-on with her fingernail.</p> <p>"This is so weird..." she whispered as she kissed her way up my neck to my earlobe. "But it feels good." My tongue slid between her full lips and we kissed again.</p> <p>She broke off the kiss so she could look me in the eyes. "I like this too," she said. "I still can't believe how big you dick is."</p> <p>I was already very wet. I loved the way she took charge. I didn't want to wait. Maybe I should just tell her how big I was. I slid my fingers over her nipples, feeling them harden under her grip.</p> <p>"Would you like to hold it like this?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I've wanted it since I met you guys. Now I just have to see just how big your thing is?" I looked at her, waiting for an answer.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, "I really like it. I've wanted one ever since that first night. It feels nice!"</p> <p>"Thanks," I replied as I reached around with my other hand and placed the head of my erection on her clit.</p> <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed. "That feels so nice!"</p> <p>I continued to rub until she pushed against my hand. My dick was covered in her saliva now and I slid it back into her mouth. This time, I slid it all the way into her throat. "Hmmmmmm!" was all we could say as she continued to hold it. I could feel and hear how her body was tensing up and tightening around my shaft and her fingers on my thighs now.</p> <p>After a few moments, we separated and looked at each other. "I'm sorry, I don't have much experience with doing that."</p> <p>She started again. "It's ok. I like to do everything I can for you."</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed her again. This time, our tongues played for a few seconds before we parted.</p> <p>"That was nice," she said.</p> <p>"We will have to do it again, some time," I replied back.</p> <p>She smiled and sat up again. "Let's get some clothes on and find that guy who did that to me," she said.</p> <p>"I'm not trying to get into any kind of relationship," I said as I ran my hand along her butt.</p> <p>"Yeahâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
