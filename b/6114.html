She tasted a little salty, not the most earthy of flavors, I thought vaguely, but she knew what to do when we kissed.</p> <p>"I haven't had sex in a long time," she said, breaking the kiss with a wink, "but then I didn't want you thinking that I was your 'cousin'"</p> <p>I was a little surprised by the bluntness of her statement, and I realized that she was actually lying. She was 'the girl' as much as I was. We had known each other for a year or so, when she had been my 'girlfriend' and I had known she was the girl.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said to her once again, "I don't want to offend you, but I just wanted to give you a chance to prove your commitment."</p> <p>"I am honored," she said, sliding down to kneel in front of me, "but I would want to know how much of this you love me."</p> <p>I nodded as she knelt before me and kissed my lips softly, pressing her soft breasts against my thighs. She broke the contact only when her mouth left mine and looked into my eyes again, her hand reaching up to stroke my face. "I love you," she told me, "and I'm so proud of you."</p> <p>With that she leaned back on the bed, lying back with her legs parted, exposing her naked pussy to me. "Kiss me here," she said as she lifted her head a little to look at me.</p> <p>I hesitated, unsure about what to do. She had promised to leave me no surprises, but for some reason I was hesitant. She hadn't used a condom on me, she hadn't slept with me and she didn't want me to feel safe. Then I saw the desire in her eyes as she stared at me, and I couldn't deny my feelings, wanting her with all my heart and being a little scared.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I managed to say as I gently kissed the inside of her thigh, "I can be a little...dirty"</p> <p>"You've kissed a lot of girls," she said with a sigh, her eyes still closed as if she was holding back tears, "and I know that if you kiss me there and do what you're thinking, I'll make sure that's enough for you."</p> <p>"Not all of your girlfriends love you," I said with a smile, "and you'd never know it by looking. They love me, you know."</p> <p>"You do?" she said with a twinkle in her eye, "they love you, too"</p> <p>After her last experience with the luscious taste of her own cunt on my lips, I was not looking forward to giving it to her, so I kissed her lips again and then leaned over, giving her a soft and gentle kiss. As if I couldn't tell she didn't want it, she reached out, taking my hand, which was still lying in bed between her thighs and placing it under her and around her left thigh.</p> <p>"Please," she whispered softly, "be gentle with me. Don't push me into anything she doesn't want to happen."</p> <p>A smile touched my lips as I started to kiss along the inside of her thigh, moving up to her pussy through the sparse strands of hair that had formed between her legs. When I reached her slit, she parted them in anticipation of receiving my mouth, which I did, gently inserting my tongue and beginning to play with her pussy-lips as she ran her fingers through my hair. I licked around them, savoring the feel of them, and then slid my tongue into her, flicking it about as she sighed and grabbed my hair and pulled it, her pussy clamping down on my tongue.</p> <p>"Ooooohhh..." she sighed softly, "Oh yes."</p> <p>I let my tongue roam, finding her hard little clit and gently licking it, my hands holding her legs up, my fingers sliding along her inner thighs to her anus, gently pulling at it as I ran my finger round and around it.</p> <p>"Oh...fuck..." she sighed, "Don't stop, no matter what."</p> <p>As my tongue had entered her pussy again, I started to lick it again, lapping away at her. She grabbed my ears and pushed herself toward my tongue as I continued to play with her pussy, my tongue flicking across it, circling it as though it was a cock, teasing her. She reached down between us and held me tightly, moaning louder as I continued to run my tongue from the base up along the sides of it with one finger, sliding it gently in and out, pulling it out of the wayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
