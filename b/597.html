The man laughed, "My name's Jim, I was looking for you to come and have a beer with me, I'm Jim and it won't hurt us to be alone if you like."</p> <p>"Well, if your not married, I don't think I'd mind." I said. To which the man smiled and held his hand out and I took it. "Can I buy you a beer?" he said, "Yes please."</p> <p>He smiled and told me to come with him to the bar.</p> <p>I was at the bar, "Can I keep my drink warm or cold?" he asked.</p> <p>"I said I wouldn't let you touch me!" I quipped. He smiled and leaned toward me, his eyes looking into my eyes, "Sure, I would like that." I smiled and stood with him. He looked at his watch.</p> <p>"Time for me to get your beer, where are we headed?" He asked. I looked at the clock on the wall and saw that it was 4:45. I nodded and headed for the table. We sat down and finished our beers, the conversation moving around to what we were going to do about my marriage... "If there was anything I wanted to ask you in the future," he said, "I was thinking of doing that on the beach!" I laughed and he nodded.</p> <p>"Well, I know about the sex stuff... but I'm not doing it that way... but, if you want to, we could do what the other two girls do in the other room."</p> <p>I looked up at Jim... I guess I got a bit out of line, in that case, he wasn't going to let that end. He smiled and put his hand on my knee, which I was now leaning on. I was enjoying it and could feel myself getting wet between my legs. My breath quickened, my heart raced, and I felt flush as my hands moved from his knee slowly up to his thigh... I felt a wetness on my thigh. He chuckled and moved his hand up to my thigh. I looked at him as I felt his fingers come to rest on my pussy. As his fingers pressed on the lips, I closed my legs together... and closed my eyes, I could feel myself tingling... I opened my eyes and looked at him. His fingers were back on my inner thigh rubbing slowly, then up to where they met on my panty material... I took a deep breath and bit my lip...</p> <p>He lifted his eyes to mine and smiled, "So, where do you want to go from here?"</p> <p>I grinned and smiled "Let's go somewhere, I want you to do whatever you want to do, you're the boss!" I replied, leaning back a little more and putting my hands on his table to spread my legs a bit. His fingers moved down inside my panties. I moved my hands to my bra and tried to unclap it, but I was getting a bit warm... and turned on. I felt his finger move to my slit and he slipped a finger into my pussy.</p> <p>"Oh my" I giggled and leaned back a little more, his fingertip now moving in and out of me.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure about that... but if it will help you, I would love to watch you." I smiled at him. His finger went back to my pussy, sliding in and out, my hands on his table now. His finger lefting itself for just a little bit, as if making an excuse... then went back to rubbing his finger on my clit. I couldn't believe it... The man I was getting to know was an older man who was watching what my friend was doing to me. It was wild! I leaned forward, putting my hands on the bar, resting my palms on the table, and leaned back again...</p> <p>"What if what you are doing?" he asked.</p> <p>I looked up at him with half closed eyes. "Why would you want to watch me do this?" I asked. He smiled and moved to his stool. My arms rested on his table as he sat there and he began fingering my pussy, "Oh, god, yes... " I said and began moving my hips to his thrusting finger. I felt another orgasm coming and I held the bar as it went, but could not get the two-letter word out of my mouth.</p> <p>Jim reached over from the table and pulled my pussy lips with his fingers, he then began to stroke my inner thighs. Each time, I opened my legs as wide as I could to receive him with a little more touch...</p> <p>He slid his finger out of me, "Not yet." He said "I want you to lean forward for me." With that he slidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
