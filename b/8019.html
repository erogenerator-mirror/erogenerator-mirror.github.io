What if you don't like it at all?"</p> <p>This time, he couldn't hide his grin behind a smile and a kiss. But it would have to wait until the end of the night for that, to enjoy this new twist with him.</p> <p>"Well, we'll have to wait till tomorrow at about the end. I guess if they can just see me... and they can still fuck me, and not feel shame for having done so. That can happen anytime, and they can just do that."</p> <p>"Do you have to be there to see anything, then? No reason to be embarrassed."</p> <p>He kissed her again. He wasn't quite sure how to start, so he said,</p> <p>"Ok, I guess you can watch."</p> <p>She smiled and leaned over to give him more space. Her body was against him now and his cock was starting to rise in anticipation. That made him so excited. But he took his time, and he could tell she was already becoming aroused. He couldn't stop himself but he knew she'd be the one to enjoy it, as much as he would. He felt lucky to meet a woman like this, and there was nothing he wanted better than to be with her.</p> <p>They kissed longer and longer. He felt her hands running up and down the ridges of his back, and she was softly stroking him through his pants.</p> <p>"Are we having a good time here?"</p> <p>"Yes, I guess we are. I could say that we've found that out pretty quickly. You can stop being shy, and keep getting into it, if you want."</p> <p>She chuckled and her body moved a little again, and he could feel how warm and moist the folds of her sex were once again, and how swollen she was. He had to hold himself back, not wanting this feeling to end, but she pushed against him and she felt so good. He had to slow his movements a bit, to find out how hard he was and how big she felt, and he felt her breathing even harder, and this gave him a little pleasure.</p> <p>He moved with her, wanting to savor every inch, every inch, but she had other ideas, and he stopped kissing her when she began to hump his cock.</p> <p>"Please... I want this. Fuck me hard. Come on, let me fuck you!"</p> <p>She held tight to him tightly, almost afraid to move. She wasn't sure if she was holding him back or pulling the plug for something else tonight, she wasn't sure either. He just held her against him with one hand and the other one started stroking her thigh. She gasped and moaned.</p> <p>"You have to hold yourself up, or I'll cum." He smiled and her face screwed up as she moaned her disappointment, which was just to much, when he felt the pressure growing.</p> <p>"Stop this, I can't take it anymore. Please let me go, I love you so much!"</p> <p>"I know, but this is really fun, I can't believe how much I need to cum."</p> <p>"You'll love it, you'll love it, you'll love this so much, and you won't even realize it!"</p> <p>She squeezed him tight and started to move in rhythm with him. She had her lips locked against his throat, her tongue running up and down his neck.</p> <p>"Do you want to cum with me? Cum, baby, cum for me, let me make you feel it!"</p> <p>"Oh, god, please, I can't do this, stop it! Please!" A bit of desperation filled her voice, but she didn't want to stop, to deny herself all that she had been doing. As she pressed hard into him, her wet folds felt every ridge and contour of his hardness, and he could feel the dampness of her arousal, felt her hot and slippery on him.</p> <p>"Say yes, say you'll love this..."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, I'll love this, oh, I can't wait anymore, I can't wait anymore!"</p> <p>"Say it!"</p> <p>"I'll love this!"</p> <p>"That's nice..." as she moved her mouth to his ear, her breath sending more sparks of fire all around the skin of his neck.</p> <p>"Say my name again, let me know."</p> <p>"Oh, god, don't make me wait anymore!" She lifted him hard from the bed, and pushed him toward her bedroom, her lips sucking at every inch of his necklineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
