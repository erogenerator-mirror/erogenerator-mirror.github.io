We kissed, our lips and tongues mingling. Neither of us spoke or made any attempt to stop, though neither of us had a clue of what to do next. After a few moments of this, he pushed me onto my back, his strong hands pulling my top up as he did. With my bottom now bare, he slowly peeled my knickers off. Then he was kneeling between my legs, taking my skirt off as I lifted my legs to assist him. He kissed my mound as it came free of the skirt, then slid his hands under to feel my naked bottom through the sheer nylon. I could hardly believe that a man my age thought to think I was so beautiful. My husband should never know what he was doing! After a few moments of this, without any further discussion to give anything away or reassurance, he went down again and pushed me back a little.</p> <p>I knew what he wanted. And I wanted him to do it as well. I could hardly believe his ability to satisfy me.</p> <p>He knelt again until he was kneeling at my head, my mouth almost level with his penis. He guided it to my mouth and in two strokes I was sucking almost as deep as I could and, even if I had any idea that it could be quite so. We fucked. It was a slow, deep, loving fuck until the pleasure became too much to bear. He lay on top me a moment, then rolled off me. I sat up and reached for a condom. I had thought about being with him, but the feel of his condom covered cock had left me too scared and exhausted to try again. He looked over to where I was, and laughed heartily.</p> <p>"I'll save that for later."</p> <p>With that, he climbed on top of me and pushed inside me. My mind screamed at me to say yes. But I didn't. Just the feeling of his cock sliding into me, his hard-on hitting my clit. The feel of his hard on penetrating me, filling me like his penis had. The feelings that they were having as my vagina filled it. My arms encircled his neck. And I pulled him in with everything I had, as well as allowing him to thrust with all his might. It was too good. But I didn't stop until I was completely lost.</p> <p>The sensation of him filling me, of both his penis and our bodies touching. It felt wonderful, in ways I had never had before.</p> <p>"So you're not a virgin, then?" he asked when they had kissed before.</p> <p>"Well, I'm still a little embarrassed, darling," I said as I rolled to his side. "I'm so happy you've let me enjoy myself."</p> <p>I reached to his face, his mouth finding mine, feeling the heat of our body as we kissed; feeling his hard cock pressing against me, trying to thrust back at me.</p> <p>"That's okay? I'm not going to come until you do."</p> <p>I was feeling really excited. I had fantasised about fucking someone like this, someone who could take, without hurting as he had. Not that I had not come from the idea I would have made it to. But it was only when he moved his penis to my side that I had thought there was something there that I couldn't believe I would be able to resist it. And now I knew it really was going to happen.</p> <p>"Are you all right?" I asked, breaking the kiss and looking into his eyes.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm yes, and I'm all right with what we are doing. It's just that the last thing I ever wanted to do was get you pregnant before I did. I've had sex with enough guys before I know I'm fertile."</p> <p>I wasn't sure at first whether it was true, but then I thought to myself, 'it's never the same thing again.'</p> <p>"I'm fine," I said as I lay back on the bed. "There's just something about what I'm feeling I couldn't control."</p> <p>"I think I'll keep that in mind," he said. "It's such a surprise to see the look in your eyes this morning and the words you said."</p> <p>"I've never seen them that way before," I continued. "It was almost as though you were looking at my breasts too. And I can't believe how turned on it makes me feel." I looked down to where my legs had been.</p> <p>"Yes, there is thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
