She smiled. "I'm Jenny's Mother."</p> <p>I smiled back. I liked this woman. I liked being attractive. "Thank you, Mother, for showing me what I should be."</p> <p>I took a deep breath. "So it's like a business?" I asked. "It pays well. But I've never worked."</p> <p>"Business," she said. "Business deals. The people that pay are rich."</p> <p>"I'd rather have money. But I've never thought I'd be at their disposal, being the youngest of their kind."</p> <p>"Do you want to start now?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Yes. I'm afraid I may be too strong. It would be unfair to leave if you didn't want to."</p> <p>I shook my head. "Nonsense. It would be better for me to stay here. I'm only a couple of years younger than you. I'll go back to wherever I was going. And stay."</p> <p>"I was curious about that," she commented. She reached out her hand. "I know there's other people here as well, but I'm sorry to go alone." She gestured to the door. "I'm sorry when I can't."</p> <p>"That's okay, I guess," I said. "The man at the door will make sure I can stay."</p> <p>Jenny smiled. "Of course."</p> <p>She smiled at me. "Would you mind if I took this man home with me? He seems nice. You could use the company. I've been working. He looks at me all the time. He'll be happy to stay with me." She winked at me. "If you want."</p> <p>I was not very popular. It wasn't easy living on the streets. My social life was mostly a social accident. My money was low, and I got a pretty good deal if somebody helped me. If they hadn't been doing it for me, I could have gotten it, but I'm sure I'd have taken it anyway.</p> <p>Jenny was so young. I guess she was too. But I wasn't that young. I was an hour older than her and much older. I would be more than happy to stay here with her if she was willing.</p> <p>I thought it was a good idea to tell her not to try to help me. I was only 18.</p> <p>"It depends on the person in charge," Jilly had said. "What do you think?"</p> <p>"It depends on who she's around and what she does for a living."</p> <p>"That's true. But we are almost at the end of our conversation. If you were around, you wouldn't need to tell me about the other guys at the store. I get that." Her voice was still a little breathless from the memory of our conversation.</p> <p>"Don't you feel lonely here?"</p> <p>She laughed. "Don't be silly," she said. "I'm just going to call you and see if you feel like visiting my mother on a regular basis, if you feel comfortable enough."</p> <p>I smiled. "Thank you. I'm sure I'll be happy to visit your mother on occasion."</p> <p>"No," she repeated. "You don't."</p> <p>"I am," I said. "I am the lonely one, Jilly."</p> <p>We both laughed. The sound had not taken much energy away from the moment. "I was a good friend of your mother before she became ill. I'm pretty good with people."</p> <p>"What did she say to you?" I asked.</p> <p>"She asked me to get you and me into the store for a couple of weeks, as long as you weren't having any kind of group sex."</p> <p>"No, that won't be necessary," I said. I meant it. I'd like to be able to spend some time with you after I'm old enough.</p> <p>She smiled. "You'll have plenty of free time, if you want to join me at my party."</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I replied. "My mother won't be happy if I'm not invited."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said with a smile. "She may just ask me to join her, but you don't have to do that."</p> <p>"But I'm on drugs."</p> <p>"Drug? What's that?" She laughed.</p> <p>"Nothin'."</p> <p>She gave me a long kiss. "I'm so glad you and your friend want to get together. I think we're going to have fun together."</p> <p>"We are," I replied, grinning.</p> <p>I was enjoying the moment. The man I'd been sleeping with was still sitting with his back turned to me. He was standing next to the door frameâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
