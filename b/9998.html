Her eyes closed and her tongue darted to the tip of my tongue and then out of my mouth and across my lips as I returned the favor. As I began to run my hands down to her panties, she opened her eyes and smiled. She ran her hands through my hair, as I ran the back of my fingers along her panties pulling them down her legs and off of her body. I moved back down and she spread her legs for me, spreading herself for me as I ran my hand along her mound.</p> <p>I kneeled at her feet as I slid my index finger between her lips and onto her hardening clit. Her mouth was wide open and her tongue darted out like a mini snake as it flicked against her upper lip. I pulled her panties away from her body, exposing her pussy directly. Her hand came to my head and began to stroke my hair as I continued to play with her hardening bud.</p> <p>I dropped to my knees and moved to the edge of my seat and moved to her side. She took hold of my head, pushing it up over top of her body and putting her legs over my shoulders, pulling me toward her. Our first kiss was just about instant. I ran my tongue over her lips and across her clit once more before darting down to her opening and running my tongue over it. I was amazed at how much more of her juices I could get in my mouth as I moved my fingers into her opening and back up to her clit. My lips closed around her nub and I began to massage her inside as I moved my tongue over her clitoris with each pass. Her hips began to buck and she pulled harder against me pulling me into her as her eyes closed and a look of bliss came across her face.</p> <p>I stood up and pulled her face out of the water. She opened her eyes and gave me a sexy smile. "What should I do?" she asked.</p> <p>"I want you to be on your back, with your legs over my shoulders." I said, pulling her panties down to free her pussy. Her eyes rolled as I slid my body down so that my head was on the edge of the bath. I grabbed her legs and pushed them over my shoulders. As I began to lick her wet pussy I put one hand behind me, behind my head as I held her legs tight and used my tongue on her as the other hand ran across her clitoris to spread her lips. She was starting to buck when she cried out in pleasure and pushed against my face, pushing my head and into her. I began to move my tongue inside of her and felt her hard nipple through the rough fabric of her bra. I looked up at her face as she began to shake, as my tongue pushed deeper into her. My tongue moved all the way up and then slid around to her entrance, as I pulled my tongue back down and licked across her clit on the down stroke then back up. Her eyes were closed as she came as she pulled me into her. I moved my hands up her torso and grabbed both of her breasts between my fingers and thumbs and rubbed her hard nipples in small circles. I could feel her tremble with each movement of mine as I kept my pace. I pulled her to the edge of the tub then turned her so that she was standing in a water-filled circle, her breasts pointed toward the heavens.</p> <p>I looked at her face as she brought her hand down to my shoulders and pushed down into the water. I moved my body so that her pussy was directly above my face. I spread her legs and then leaned in. I could hear the sound as my lips met with the opening to her warm canal. I ran my tongue across the rim and pushed my tongue deep into her as my tongue began to move inside her.</p> <p>I felt her body quiver and she pulled her arms across my shoulders as her body jerked against my lips and tongue. Her legs began to shake as her body shook as she came. I moved my mouth side to side and sucked on her as she shook through another orgasm. As she lay on my body I could taste the sweet tang of her orgasm on my tongue as I pulled my head from her thighs. Her arms fell to her sides as she moved on my chest and face. I moved down and took her bottom lip between my lips and gently sucked as I pulled on her lips with my teeth. My mouth moved to the tip of her tongue and I ran my tongue around it. Her legs opened to me and she began to stroke the top of my head as I continued to run my tongue up her soft lips. She pulled me close to her as she pressed against my lips and tongue before lifting herself in the water. As she lowered herself she slipped off of my chest and put her wet fingers on my cock.
