She sat up straight looking about her.</p> <p>"I have to talk to you. Please don't leave. Don't stay too long. I need to find a place, or I will never come back here again."</p> <p>"What? Where? No where? What happened? Who is there?"</p> <p>"Let me explain."</p> <p>He moved to stand right in front of her, sitting beside her on the bed. "There is no place like home. I have to look. Now."</p> <p>"What is this place?"</p> <p>Taking a hand he lifted it to the light on the wall and pulled her to her feet.</p> <p>"I am not coming back. I will return to Earth," was all she could say.</p> <p>He nodded toward the large clock. "Time will run out, and in the meantime we have some time to ourselves. You must understand that we will not be long." Turning away he walked to the door, and closed it for her. "I will leave before anything happens that we cannot live with."</p> <p>She took a step toward the door and stopped. "What is this place? What happened to me?"</p> <p>"You are the light of my life. Your life is about to end."</p> <p>She thought about that for a moment before she nodded in understanding. He was on his own and he would see her again, soon. If only...</p> <p>*</p> <p>The sun came up over the horizon, and from the shadows of the trees she watched him. The figure of a man sat on the couch opposite her. His hair, once dark, was now a mass of red locks, and she realized that was the cause of her worry. The man turned to face her as she came down, and her hands rose to cover the small wound on her neck. He smiled, a mischievous gleam appearing in his eyes as his eyes turned to survey her. She felt a blush crawl over and through her, as she watched his hands caress her skin, causing the scars that she never noticed previously.</p> <p>He was not alone this time. He looked up in her face, and his hand went to her cheek.</p> <p>"It isn't your fault," he said softly.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter."</p> <p>"I'm not leaving here. Don't leave me." As he spoke, his lips brushed her cheek.</p> <p>She shivered. "This is no place for me to go."</p> <p>"I know." His hand went to her knee, and moved gently to cup her bare cheek. "I am here with you. Always."</p> <p>"I am glad for that," she managed to say. The look that came to her lips as his lips moved closer made her want his touch to stay. He put a finger to her lips, and turned her face toward his as he leaned in to kiss her. "If you want to go, I can get you your belongings, and you will return to my kind for the rest of the night."</p> <p>The hand that had been covering the scar on her neck moved to begin to unbutton her shirt, and she watched him. Her hand slid from the spot on her neck to slip inside, cupping his face in her hand as her fingers moved his hair. Her body was on fire. His hand went inside her shirt, cupping her breast through the thin cotton. His lips moved over her neck, and she felt his teeth slide against her skin. He had not come in her mouth and she stilled as his tongue moved into her ear.</p> <p>"I want us to stay like this for the rest of the night if you want to," his voice was husky.
