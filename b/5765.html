I was already wet, and a pearly drop of sperm could have fallen between my fingers. "We used to fuck all the time, you know."</p> <p>We both laughed. "Yeah, you do have the sweetest ass, you know," Lainie said huskily.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's sweet, but I don't think you're the only one. Some of your boyfriends had to take me on while they thought the other guy was dead."</p> <p>"Oh, I know. You could really turn to one of those when the night comes. My pussy's got a nice hard cock that can last a long time. I'm getting a little scared though, what if he's gone?"</p> <p>Lainie pouted. "Come with me, then. If he was that good... that big of a fuck... he could have my ass every day, but I know you can handle him."</p> <p>She gave a cute little smirk. "Yeah, but I really want one of these nights."</p> <p>Lainie and I climbed on each other and kissed hotly, like two lovers who'd just been in the same room for years. Lainie moaned as she rubbed her pussy against my clitoris and I held her with a hand on her head and pushed my face into her neck, enjoying every inch of her flesh. She ground and squirmed against me, the skin between us slippery and warm. After a long, satisfying moment, Lainie released me and said, "You're such a good little cocksucker."</p> <p>The two of us rolled over and Lainie's hand found my mouth. Her eyes were bright and clear, her voice quavering. "Mmm... what are you up to?"</p> <p>"I'm thinking about fucking a little college coed."</p> <p>"Hmmmm... I'd love for you to fuck that one, too..."</p> <p>My hands were in wonder at the thought, and Lainie's eyes widened. "And let me know if I can ever get it up again."</p> <p>I was already feeling horny, and it wasn't just the thought of getting fucked. "Oh, you can't?"</p> <p>"What do you think? Are you still thinking about it?"</p> <p>"What? No," I shook my head, surprised. "I'm just... I dunno."</p> <p>"Come on. You better come over here, before I change my mind." And with that, she jumped on me and kissed my mouth and face. "I want you to fuck my friends now, won't you?"</p> <p>I was a little shocked. "They're all so gorgeous," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, come on, sweetie. They're all going to get it."</p> <p>"I don't want to give them up," I promised, wondering how she'd feel about it. "But you know as well as I do that I'm not about to be anywhere other than my best friend's husband."</p> <p>"Why the hell not?" she replied, "and if you were my boyfriend, I wouldn't mind taking yours with me."</p> <p>"Well, not tonight," I agreed sadly.</p> <p>"But you're not going to be seeing them... alone, right?" She was still holding me and caressing my breasts and pouting over my lips. "Let's stay here, okay? Let me fuck your boyfriend. I know you can handle that."</p> <p>"But why do we have to stop?"</p> <p>"Because I'd just as soon as he was able to take all of us, we could switch off and..."</p> <p>"We wouldn't want to fuck him again, would we?" I said. Then, with as much force as I could muster, I kissed her mouth and chin and licked her neck. We both moaned in pleasure and Lainie's eyes rolled back. "Oh, God. Make love to me, Lainie. Come here for a second, please." I felt a thrill run through me at her words, but it was the realization that she was all I had hoped for. She was the perfect woman for me, sweet and kind, and I couldn't imagine a worse time to be in the bed with her than tonight.</p> <p>I turned onto my side without saying a word, resting a hand on the small of Lainie's back. She turned onto her front and we kissed hotly. Her lips were hot and she teased my nipples and neck as I moaned and thrust at her.
