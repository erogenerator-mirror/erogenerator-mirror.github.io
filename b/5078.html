This man has a dick! But I decided that I would do it!</p> <p>On Tuesday he called. He said that he was so proud of me, and that he had "accidentally" left a DVD for me at home. He said that he had to go and he did it so that I wouldn't be disappointed in my "new partner." I didn't know what to expect, so I just put the DVD in back. He made sure that the batteries were plugged into a charger so that we could watch it again.</p> <p>I was so nervous, I started to get hard. I could feel the lump in my pants as I tried to resist him. I didn't want to admit it to anyone, but I couldn't help myself because I was so excited at the thought that he could be my first.</p> <p>After he disconnected, he said to me, "You look really hot when you get done working around the store. It would be a very nice treat for you, don't you think?"</p> <p>I had already cum at least once, but I felt pretty slutty talking to him tonight. I had never been interested but this kind of a turn-on.</p> <p>I replied, "I really want to, but I have to work. So you've gotta work."</p> <p>He laughed and said, "You might want to wait till we get home before you make a big move on me."</p> <p>As we pulled up to the house, I was nervous, he would not be disappointed. But he kept talking and even pulled me in the door saying, "Don't worry about a thing. We'll take good care of you. The whole deal is in the history books because you should have seen yourself when you worked at the store."</p> <p>Once we came in through the front door, I went to him and leaned up against the doorframe, kissing him. His hands were all over me, but only touching me. He pulled my shirt off and I slipped my bra off as he continued kissing me. We were both moaning, our hands roaming over each other's bodies. His tongue was in my mouth and it felt so natural to me to respond to him.</p> <p>The kiss went on, and I could only breathe faster. His hands were on me, almost pulling me into him, and then he began moving down my body taking my bra off, pulling me into him and kissing me again. His right hand was all over me as my heart was racing and I could not believe how excited I was.</p> <p>He finally got my bra off and he slipped his hands inside my panties, moving between my legs. My skirt was still on and he slipped a finger in my wet pussy. I moaned in his mouth and he pulled the crotch of me underwear away, giving it to me. He licked my lips as he fingered me until I came again, moaning and squirting my pussy juices onto his fingers.</p> <p>He told me to turn around and bend over the arm of the sofa. I did as he said, looking back over my shoulder at him, waiting for his next instructions, I felt like I could do anything I wanted with him.</p> <p>He put on some music and we started dancing around the living room, our bodies pressed against one another. I could feel his hard cock against my ass and it made me quiver. And I knew that I had to have him inside me.</p> <p>When the music ended, he took my hand and led me into the bedroom. We laid on the bed and I was afraid that this was going to be a one-time thing. I wanted to please him beyond words. I knew he could give me whatever I wanted. But I had to do this for him right now. I kissed and licked my way down his body, starting at his shoulders and moving to his nipples, licking, nibbling, kissing them, sucking on them.</p> <p>When I reached his cock, I licked the head, and then kissed the head, taking his little slit in my mouth, and taking the rest of his cock in. I opened my mouth and took him in, sucking, licking.</p> <p>It was exciting. This was such an exciting new experience for a man. I wanted to give him pleasure. He was enjoying himself, so I wanted to give him pleasure. I wanted him to enjoy it. I took him all in. I didn't want to go slow or anything else. I wanted him to savor this moment.</p> <p>I wanted him to make me his. My mouth was wide open and I wanted to breathe and taste him, and I wanted to feel him in my stomach. I wanted to feel his cum and know that I could make him happy tonight. I took him, licking, sucking and kissing him, loving every minute of it. I wanted him to be happy.
