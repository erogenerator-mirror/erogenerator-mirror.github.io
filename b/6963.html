She said.</p> <p>"Sorry, but I couldn't resist."</p> <p>"Thank you for being such an amazing husband."</p> <p>She nodded and pulled his hand to her mouth and started sucking on his fingers as she spoke. Her tongue and mouth caressed his fingers as she continued to suck on them, sliding her tongue into his mouth and licking his cheeks, as if tasting them. It was a very sweet sensation to feel someone sucking on your tongue.</p> <p>After a few moments, she pulled away and grinned at him. "Now, I want you for a real fun session."</p> <p>"You bet!" And he stood up and led her to the desk chair by the door before they kissed very passionately again.</p> <p>Then, all of a sudden he was there, standing in front of her, with his mouth hovering just above her. She reached over to put a hand on his crotch and felt how hard he was already getting. She had a hard time with that because he was so much more than she. She also could feel how heavy his cock was, as if it wanted to get free, yet was so engorged it was rock hard.</p> <p>She had to get closer to feel him touch her, as she felt her pussy ache for him to be inside her, to feel him take her, and she started to get moist and excited again.</p> <p>She moaned into his mouth as she slid her hands back to feel his cock through his pants. She didn't want to touch it, not yet, but she wanted to do so. She wanted to feel the hardness inside her, in her hole, anywhere.</p> <p>He pulled back at the first touch of her lips to his face and she stopped kissing him and opened her eyes to see him peeling off his pants, giving her a look.</p> <p>There was nothing but lust on his face, as it didn't take him long to unzip his pants. She couldn't resist licking her lips, as her pussy throbbed for more of his touch.</p> <p>His cock was just about as hard as it gets (she was a little worried about how big it could get in her), and the head of it was slightly bigger than a half inch. It was a little smaller than she is used to (her husband usually got bigger when a blowjob) but he didn't seem to mind that.</p> <p>He slowly unbuttoned her blouse, sliding the buttons off her shoulders and letting them drop in a heap around her feet. He kissed her neck and he moved to her chest, taking first one nipple then the other into his mouth, biting gently, teasing them.</p> <p>"Oooh...please. More..." she whispered. Her heart pounded as she couldn't speak. Then he kissed her, as she closed her eyes and her mouth opened as much as she could, allowing him to kiss her with lips he could.</p> <p>In the meantime, she slid her hand past his shirt until it was rubbing his cock through his pants. Then, his lips were on hers, and while she kissed him, she unzipped his pants and stroked his hard cock through his boxers. She could tell the head was throbbing so she gave the head a few kisses and it stood up hard as a board. She took her lips away from his and looked at him, wanting to see his reaction to what she was doing. She didn't have to ask him now.</p> <p>And at the same time, she was feeling very hot, as his mouth tasted of her. She could feel her nipples pressing into his chest, as her breasts swelled ever harder to his touch. She loved the feeling of being desired again.</p> <p>His kisses were now on her neck, from her ear down to her chin to her neck all the way to her shoulder. All the while, he was nibbling and licking her neck and her earlobe, and she knew he was doing it to her to the point of no return. It couldn't get any better than that.</p> <p>He pushed her down, and she went back to kissing him when she felt his hand slowly begin to undo his pants while he still had his lips on hers. She felt a bit ashamed of herself for her actions of being his woman...that she wanted to be taken, but she didn't want to stop or change a thing.</p> <p>Her body trembled as she heard him unzip his pants. She felt him start to stroke himself just for a moment, before slipping them off and letting them drop on the floor. He was standing nude between her knees, as he stood up, his cock bobbing between his legs.</p> <p>She looked at it, waiting for him to say something. He still had on his boxers and he moved them back to where the rest of his clothes were. Then he knelt down, still keeping his head between her legsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
