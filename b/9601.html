The sight of her perfect body, and her tight shorts had me instantly excited. I started kissing her neck and her lips. Her hands were on my head, so gently stroking me, she smiled and looked at me. 'I don't normally do this for you, Sam; it's kind of a turn on. It's very unlike having a boyfriend, and you do it for me.'</p> <p>She was moving into me now and was rubbing herself on my crotch. She was so wet but wasn't making much more of it. Our mouths were now pressed together and our tongues were dancing together as we moaned into each other.</p> <p>The kissing had stopped and Sam was pulling up her shorts but not taking hers off, all of them now completely naked. She went back to work on my cock again, taking it in her mouth and sucking me off.</p> <p>She was driving me wild as her mouth engulfed my cock and I felt the wetness of her mouth when it happened. It was like a warm bath and it was amazing. I never knew women could do things like this but the pleasure I had just felt was beyond words.</p> <p>Sam was working me up to a fast orgasm and her mouth was still wrapped around me when I felt her lips slide off of me. She licked her lips and grinned, then kissed me and licked her own juices off of my face, then kissed me again and she kissed me again.</p> <p>We looked at each other, then smiled and kissed again. I moved one hand up above her head, her mouth still wide open and I stroked her head, letting her do all of the work of the kissing. Then I pushed her head down and she did the same for me. Lifting her off of me she had a happy smile on her face. Her hand went down and undid my pants, sliding one hand inside and stroking me.</p> <p>'Jesus Christ, Sam.' I groaned as we did each other, I think. 'I don't even know who you are, I don't even know you.'</p> <p>I saw a worried look cross her eyes. 'I'm not sure I want to be that way with anyone.' Then she kissed me, and again that gentle, moist wet kiss. Then I put her down and knelt back up, moving forward until I was pressing my throbbing cock against her lips.</p> <p>'Are you sure you want to do this?' I asked.</p> <p>'You know I do! I'll do it.' She smiled, and her hands were at my back. 'I want you both to fuck me. I am completely yours.'</p> <p>I felt I had to try and make this as quick as I could. I felt like I had to go slowly. But I knew that for me that wouldn't be a bad thing, that I could be enjoying her body before I did anything else. I was looking forward to this.</p> <p>I felt her warm skin beneath mine, then her hand began sliding up and down my cock. It was wet and slippery, and I felt her hot, wet lips slide along the head of my dick and slide down it, as she gripped me. Then again, and again. I looked over at her, her eyes were closed and she looked lost. I loved feeling that she cared, so completely with whom she was having sex with. She was a woman and I could have cared less. She could have chosen to live with me all her life, and she did. I loved her like that, and the thought of getting that much pleasure for her, made me happy.</p> <p>And then she was sucking me, her saliva was running around the base of my prick now. The sight of her taking the entire length of me in her mouth was really getting to me. I felt the familiar tingle deep in my lower belly as she stroked my cock and her mouth slid up and down on it. She looked up at me while she was working me and smiled. 'It's my turn now.'</p> <p>I moved her off of me, sitting her back down on the bed. She smiled at me and her knees were still raised, so I leaned forward, slipping my hands back underneath her thighs and slipping my fingers under the soft flesh and stroking her. I felt her hands on my shoulder as I pressed my cock harder into her.</p> <p>'Take off your shirt, Sam'. Her eyes were wide and I could tell that my words were pushing her toward something she had never done. Once she had her shirt off she was smiling and shaking her head. 'It still hurts?' she asked.</p> <p>'It's okay' I smiled, then liftedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
