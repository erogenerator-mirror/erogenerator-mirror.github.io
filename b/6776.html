Work yourself all out. Let it all out. I won't hurt you."</p> <p>She began sucking vigorously and I pushed and pulled at her neck, pulling it away. She moaned and cried with pleasure, and pulled my cock down to her mouth.</p> <p>She opened with a wet "O" and took me in her mouth, her lips sliding effortlessly up and down my cock. I moaned, and groaned and thrashed around as she took me in her mouth. Her hand was working its own magic against my dick, her mouth moving in a circle more and more vigorously.</p> <p>"Fuck me."</p> <p>"That's it....oh. Fuck."</p> <p>I pushed on her head and she lifted a little, her eyes closed as she sucked me. I ran my fingers through her hair and she began sucking and licking me more frantically. I pushed on her head again and her lips closed around me, her own eyes closing, and her tongue lashing my head as I pushed my dick into her mouth. She pushed more and more against me, her mouth sliding down my shaft in the wetness, making me moan and groan and grunt with each downward thrust. I pulled in her hair and she stopped sucking suddenly. She looked up at me, eyes half-closed and her mouth full.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said.</p> <p>I was on the edge now, her mouth wrapped around me and I pushed hard down into her throat, my head thrusting back and forth. My hand clenched and I pulled almost half of me down so she held still and I pulled out until I hit the back of her throat. This pushed her further against me as my dick left her throat. Her eyes rolled up in her head and she began to come again. It kept on coming with her mouth on me and I could feel it deep down. My hand let go of her hair and I pushed hard at her. The hand pulled back with my head and she kept on coming, and coming.</p> <p>I felt her coming again, her body shaking from her orgasm, her tongue slithering out of her mouth. I lifted her head up and kissed her fiercely and she pushed away and moved back into me again.</p> <p>We made love in several different positions for a total of five minutes, and I could not get the feeling we were making our love for the third time in one session.</p> <p>We held one another as we slept, one hand fondling each other. I was looking down at her with a look of complete love and pride. I had seen her so much, it felt like I could feel her for the first time.</p> <p>When she stirred again, I held her tight, and she moaned for the third time in one session. She was still awake, though her eyes were still closed. She opened her eyes a little in surprise, and I grinned, then kissed the nape of her neck. She shivered.</p> <p>"That's me," she said, and I knew. "I felt it."</p> <p>"My god, it was like that for the first time."</p> <p>"Can we make it last longer?" Her eyes went wide again.</p> <p>"What's your plan?" I asked. "Let me tell you about it."</p> <p>"The first time?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Let's see....."</p> <p>I lifted her chin and kissed her deeply and she opened her eyes and kissed me back. I slipped my finger between her legs once more and slipped a third one into her, and she moaned. The feeling was incredible, the wetness and warmth and slickness all around me. I was stroking her so deeply, the tips of my fingers were rubbing and stroking against each other in the softness of her cunt.</p> <p>"Oh god, honey."</p> <p>"Yes, sweetheart. Don't stop."</p> <p>I felt the rush of her blood, as it raced through every nerve of her body, from her head to her toes. Her hips lifted slightly and I pushed two in as I lapped at her ear and neck and earlobe, and felt her breathing deep in her throat.</p> <p>"Does it feel like the first time?" I whispered in her mouth.</p> <p>"I can tell. It's exciting."</p> <p>"It's the first time."</p> <p>"No, we can't have that," she said and kissed me. "I've thought it for so long we should be getting it the way we want."</p> <p>"So do you now," I urged her.</p> <p>"Doesn't matter how much we want it. That's the way we're going to give it to ourselves."</p> <p>"What?" I asked quizzically.</p> <p>She kissed me hard and said, "I'm going to make you my first sex slave."</p> <p>"Who?" I askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
