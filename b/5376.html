I said.</p> <p>Mark picked up his phone from his table and dialed a number I didn't recognize.</p> <p>"I have to go to the airport and pick up a new client that is having trouble getting their flight to be done. They are supposed to be flying in tonight. I want to meet up here in about fifteen minutes" He said while dialing the number.</p> <p>He pulled up and parked in the spot where I had parked and went and got his luggage. He went back into the office and called the same office number he had in his home.</p> <p>"This is David. I am meeting with Mr. Mark Davis at the airport. He is about to have a conference meeting that he has to give me the last part of the presentation" David told us.</p> <p>I was about the same size as Mark but not to the same height. I was a little under six feet. I was about a C cup so I was about average compared to his two inches. David and Mark met for lunch in the conference room and went to the restroom. When Mark opened the stall he pushed me into one of the stalls and kissed me. He was very gentle so I had no resistance other than the urge to do him again.</p> <p>He moved his mouth down to my chest and bit my nipples to the point of pain just a little. My cock jumped and a trickle of pre-cum flowed under the fabric of my underwear. Mark pushed me back, reached behind me and undid my pants. I sat down with a little of my weight resting on my left leg. Mark pulled my underwear to my knees and began rubbing my cock through my pants.</p> <p>"I want to hear how much cock you want me to have. Tell me how much you want to have my cock in your ass." Mark kissed me again and I heard a slight whimper in his voice.</p> <p>"Do you want to have my cock in your ass?" Mark asked as he rubbed my cock between my legs.</p> <p>My cock was hard at the thought of being inside Mark. It had just been a couple of months since I had been with my wife and I knew it didn't have to be that way. Mark continued to rub my cock and slowly slid his mouth up the length of it before kissing my stomach and licking his way to my balls once every few seconds. I could already feel pre-cum oozing from my cock tip into Mark's mouth.</p> <p>Mark opened his mouth more and I felt his tongue swirl around the head and move into my pubic hair before I felt him press his warm lips around my cock head. I watched him as he pulled up on my cock with his mouth and slid in and out while he rubbed the shaft up and down with his mouth. My cock throbbed, pre-cum was oozing from me onto Mark's lips and face. Mark slid his mouth up and down again before taking me completely in. He slid my cock from his mouth, moved one of his hands around to my ass and began to rub my hole. I could feel how tight it was and it felt so hot sliding up and down his cock on each stroke. Mark looked up and into my eyes as he began to rub my hole.</p> <p>I moaned and moaned "Fuck, you are so slick. I should be so fucking lucky to get that fucking hole."</p> <p>I could feel the heat of Mark's body and it turned me on even more. If that wasn't enough, Mark's hands were working on my hole with their fingers while his tongue worked on my cock head. I had never felt anything so erotic. My face felt even more red and flushed as I felt something warm press against my opening. I felt Mark's finger press against me and then I felt his finger slide into me. My back stiffened and arched. I felt my heart beating almost to fever pitch. I almost couldn't breathe. A wave of pleasure shook the length of my cock that had been trapped between Mark's lips. I was shaking with pleasure. The pleasure was so intense that I felt dizzy. I wasn't sure how to react or why.</p> <p>Mark removed Mark's finger from my anus and began to rub my cock head again. I could feel my cock thicken. I knew I couldn't take much more of this before they got it done. Mark began to lick me again and I moaned in pleasure again. Mark slid his finger up to my hole and pressed firmly inside me. I felt my ass muscles clench around his fingers as I continued to orgasm. Mark slowly pulled his finger out again and I felt his lips kiss my cock again. He stood up again and moved to the chair where he had been sitting as I watched him. He put his hands on his knees spreading his legs. I couldn't see what he was doing because my face was buriedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
