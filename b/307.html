That turned us on to no end and one after another, we both moaned, groaned, and finally collapsed in the back seat of our car. She had never come like that before and she wanted to feel me inside her. We kissed deeply and I had only the tiniest bit of my tongue in the wetness between her breasts.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" she asked, "I thought we were going to the beach." The thought made me smile again and the thought made me smile with my cock still inside of her and feeling her softness.</p> <p>"We'll see," I grinned. She had done the right thing, it seemed. Her eyes were clouded for a moment just before she closed them again. "We'll go to that park, but I'll drive," I said, "and you'll drive with me." We held each other for a while and I had another idea. We kissed and she rolled over and lay between my legs. We were both out of breath and still horny. We kissed again and she slid her breasts over my face, then turned so that I could return the favor.</p> <p>"Oh my," she sighed, "I never felt that. Did you really know anything about women?" I told her no and started nibbling on her shoulder and neck gently and she murmured her approval. I could feel her breathing deepening as I went lower until I could lick and kiss and kiss and then tongue her pussy like a small prick-o-nine-tails. She began to moan a little louder and her body rose a little, and my tongue slid into her tunnel even deeper and her body began to quiver and her hips pushed against me.</p> <p>"Uhnnn...oh, yes...that's where we were going," she moaned. I slid two fingers into her and began slowly fucking her. I loved the tightness of her tightness while she was so open, so wet, and warm. "Oh ...oh...my...god I like it...my love..."</p> <p>"Is it really...hard...my love," I wondered out loud. She was on her back in our car, naked and spread out in the front seat. A young man, naked except for his boxers, with his dick in his mouth was going in and out of her pussy and I was going back to where I had left off. As I kissed her, she put me at ease and began to kiss around my lips and tongue. I pushed my hips against hers to feel the friction, feeling her respond to my motions, which became less so, as she continued kissing me and rubbing her pussy against my thigh.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked, but with her mouth still on mine.</p> <p>I looked over her shoulder to where the two young men had her by for some lubrication, and she was still kissing me and pushing her pussy against my leg as she slid a finger up into my ass. When I put my hand out to help, she pulled her lips back from my mouth and reached down between our bodies to grab my pole, and then brought my fingers to her lips. "Mmmm, you taste as good as you smell," she said, and then licked her lips. As she lowered her head back to my lap, with my fingers still in her mouth, she pulled her fingers out and brought them to her mouth, taking a taste with one. "Do you know who this is, the driver and I?" she asked coyly and I saw her fingers disappear into her mouth with another moan. "Of course!" she smiled and I felt her tongue lap at her juices and my fingers sliding down inside her pussy. "That is my husband," she whispered to me as we kissed and she put my fingers back to her lips and started sucking them. I knew I should stop, but I had to take care of her pleasure, too. Her mouth was so warm and soft, and I had just been with her. I could feel her tongue licking around and it almost brought me off in another second as she continued to suck. I moved it downward and found her hard clit. I couldn't believe how good her clit felt, it was like it was an extension of my tongue in her pussy, and I couldn't describe how good a tongue felt. As I played my tongue around and inside her wetness, she pushed my fingers out of her mouth and licked her lips and sucked and rubbed her fingers all around her pussy and clit.</p> <p>Her breathing was getting shorter and she was grinding against me hard, but there was no need to put anything in her mouth. I felt her hand on my shoulder again, then she rolled over and pulledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
