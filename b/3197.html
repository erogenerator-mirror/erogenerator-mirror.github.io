I'm sure I'll have enough trouble getting laid by him before nightfall.</p> <p>"Anyway, it's time to go and have a relaxing bath with some ice cubes I've got in the freezer.</p> <p>"The warm water works nicely.</p> <p>He kissed her cheek, and started to go down the drain.</p> <p>She whispered to him, "It's not nice to go without a shower, do you like to go to the baths?"</p> <p>They got in the steaming water, his erection growing more noticeable.</p> <p>He said "I think that I'd rather give you one for that."</p> <p>She giggled and said "Are you kidding, I feel it throbbing as I wash."</p> <p>She was right. He was getting stiffer more by the minute.</p> <p>She said "Well, can I change and use the hot water again, you can join me."</p> <p>"Oh no ma'am" he said, "You can't just wash with all the men in there."</p> <p>"What," she replied. "I am so out of practice, all you can say is that?"</p> <p>But, I didn't bother to argue. He followed her in and she pulled off her bathing suit bottom and panties (a small blue satin one with lots of black embroidered around the edges).</p> <p>I had to admit, she appeared to be a good looking girl. Her tits were not too big, but her ass was pretty firm and smooth.</p> <p>"Well, you can try to please yourself in here with me" he said as he stepped into the tub with her. He turned her around, and leaned close to her.</p> <p>He put his hands on her shoulders and slowly moved them to cup her breasts.</p> <p>"Do you like it?"</p> <p>"No," she replied a little nervously, "I mean, yes. But only in private."</p> <p>"That's okay, since we're not too far from here," he said.</p> <p>He massaged her breasts with his fingers, circling her nipples. She was breathing very fast, but when I put my hand on her leg (or, in front of him in that case), she was just squirming in his arms.</p> <p>He leaned right toward her and gently pressed his lips against hers, "Have you ever had a good hard cock in your mouth, ma'am?" he asked.</p> <p>"No" she gulped.</p> <p>"Well, you'll find out," he said as he knelt down in the tub, still fully clothed, his hard cock pointed right at her.</p> <p>She just looked in his face, as his hard dick was inches from hers.</p> <p>He leaned in and placed his lips right on hers and kissed her. He rubbed his lips against hers as he pressed his lips against hers, and then he placed his lips on hers again.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and said, "Do you want to feel it?"</p> <p>"Sure, what do you have in mind," he asked.</p> <p>"I don't care," she muttered. "I'm not going to stop until you are."</p> <p>He reached down to her shoulders and began to rub the length of his cock in her cleavage.</p> <p>"No way" she muttered. "Just move your hand."</p> <p>"No. We're not going to get back on. Please, ma'am," he begged.</p> <p>"No, we're not even," she said. "This is your first time, you can just pretend."</p> <p>He continued to kiss her, then stopped for a minute.</p> <p>Then, he slowly lowered the back of his towel and moved to sit next to her. Her hands began to move to his thigh, but he wouldn't let her touch a thing. Finally, he put his thumb on her collar bone and massaged lightly just under the valley of her breasts. Then, he slowly moved his hand up her torso to the bottom of the towel. He slowly eased it down over her hips, down to the bottom of her ass. His hands moved away from the fabric covering her, so he could caress her lower back.</p> <p>"Do you like my breasts, ma'am?" he asked.</p> <p>"Mhm," she replied, "Yes."</p> <p>He placed his hand in the middle of her chest between her breasts and gently massaged the globes.</p> <p>He continued to rub the firm orbs.</p> <p>"Are they not soft to the touch, ma'am?" he asked.</p> <p>"Mhm, yes, so are they," she replied, "I'm not very experienced with them."</p> <p>He gave her lower back another gentle rub.</p> <p>He turned her back to face him.</p> <p>He leaned forward and he took her nipple in one hand, and reachedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
