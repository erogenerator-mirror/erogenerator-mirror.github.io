His tongue moved and slid in and out of my mouth, and then we got into a nice easy rhythm. I moved one hand over top of his, and started kneading his ass with the other hand. I felt him begin to move faster and harder, and my mouth moved to move over to his nipples, and then down his stomach and then to his penis. When I could take it no longer I stopped.</p> <p>He pulled back after a moment and said, "That was awesome."</p> <p>I leaned over and gave him some of my saliva, before leaning back again and taking him into my mouth again. It wasn't too bad, in fact it was even pleasant. I felt hands touching my breasts, and then I realized it was Greg’s. When he went back to kissing his beautiful lips I could tell that he wasn't afraid to kiss me any more. I was getting more turned on by the second.</p> <p>The feeling of Greg’s soft hands on my breasts was just too much. I began to move my hips up and down so that my hard cock would rub on his stomach. But I knew it wasn’t much, so I went back down on him, and felt him respond by moving his hips in a grinding motion against my mouth. It wasn’t easy being so wet in between his legs, as he continued to push his penis up into my mouth, and I continued to move it around, and move my tongue about as he drove it up and down his shaft.</p> <p>I reached under the bed and found the bottom of the bed, and I pulled out a couple of blankets (I don’t know where it got them from) and spread them under me. I then lay down next to Greg, and he began to pull up the blanket again. I wasn’t too concerned with that much, as I had taken my pillows off. I turned my head away from Greg, and his eyes were looking at me as his penis was coming out of my mouth, even though it was already harden and starting to slide between my lips. Greg began to rub a breast as he came on top of me, and before long (maybe a few seconds) he grabbed me, and forced himself down between my legs. He held his stiff member with one hand, and I used my right hand to put his against my cock.</p> <p>The warm feeling was incredible. He slid himself up and down my member as he continued to slide his hand on it. “What the fuck!” I thought. Greg then pulled back so that he could look down at me to see me in between those lovely legs. His penis was still wet with my saliva, which looked like I was rubbing it up and down his shaft, as his hand continued rubbing up and down. I could now see his balls hanging down slightly, as if waiting for his load to hit the air.</p> <p>I could tell by the expression on Greg’s face that he was enjoying his cock sliding up and down my face. He began to grind harder and harder into me. And after a few moments (which seemed like a good long while) he pushed himself against me and came with a groan. His body went limp against my naked body as the last bit of semen came oozing out of his penis. As he did so, I could feel his hands running up and down me. When he got off of me, he pulled up the blanket with him, and I thought that he might still be up and about, but that idea was quickly dismissed when I felt his hot mouth kissing my asscheeks. I turned to face him and saw that Greg had moved his erection back, and that he was now laying on top of me with his hand on my chest, and his head next to mine. We slowly kissed, and I could taste myself on his tongue. After a minute, the kissing stopped, and he said, “Thanks, that was fucking amazing. I’m sure my dick won’t be hard again for a while”</p> <p>I could not resist. I wanted the warm feeling I had earlier to continue. “Well Greg,” I said coyly, “we probably will have to do something about that after a few more nights of fucking, but you can have me anytime you want me!”</p> <p>I reached down and ran my finger around the head of his penis, where it seemed to have a life of its own. I ran my hand down to it and began to run it up and down on him, while simultaneously rubbing my hand over his pubic hair. When I felt his organ begin to swell again, I started to massage it to see how hard it was. And Greg leaned his head forward and kissed the top of my head. We both broke the kiss for a moment, and then—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
