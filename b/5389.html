With his left forearm, he caressed her left breast, running his hand just under the hem of her shirt, gently rubbing her nipple with his thumb under the cloth. He heard her sigh heavily as he did this and knew she was feeling the same. He looked up into her eyes and felt his way down to where his tongue gently kissed the tip of her erect nipple.</p> <p>She arched her back and pushed herself against him, trying to meet his mouth with those beautiful lips and tongue... He felt his whole world beginning to tilt as he felt the warm, moist and wet heat of her mouth encompass him in a warm, wet, mouth...he felt her tongue gently tease his, as well, and he felt his cock begin to grow. Suddenly, he realized that the world had tilted again, as if the previous events were becoming more vivid and erotic. A feeling of erotic energy exploded through him, like a tidal wave, that he didn't even know it existed. He was in love, in lust, in love-in and in lust with this beautiful angel and the world seemed to tilt just a little.</p> <p>He sat up suddenly, causing her to pull her shirt back up and he realized he had lost them because she was wearing a bra, but she did so quickly, again, and he felt his own pants come down a little more when she reached for his hand. He felt the heat on his fingers as he held her hand.</p> <p>"Did I wake you up by saying goodmorning, Baby?"</p> <p>She smiled at him, slowly and innocently, her head tilting towards the sound, "Oh, yes, Jake. I was just remembering something about going to work. I'll take my car and get on the bus." She looked back at him, her eyes sparkling and her smile broad and happy before she leaned towards him, kissed him deeply and then sat against his chest.</p> <p>"I was not sure what I was thinking about, but it was just perfect!" He felt her sigh and roll her eyes back, "Come on, let's go get some breakfast." she said, as she got up and began to get her things.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>When they returned to the kitchen and sat down to breakfast, they each grabbed a fork and started with the food, while sitting opposite one another, Jake with a fork resting on top of her head, Sarah on the opposite side of him. After eating, they sat there and Jake felt his dick begin to swell again just looking at her. As he looked back and forth from her, he could see her nipples hardening. She was still smiling at him, but was now watching him intently. He smiled back.</p> <p>"Do you have a story to tell me about your past boyfriends?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Maybe we could give it a try." She replied. She watched Jake's face as she said the word, and felt her heart pounding in her throat. She knew her eyes were looking into his eyes. She took two deep breaths and then said to him, "This isn't going to be too bad...not while it's still fresh" She giggled and said, "And we can really enjoy it"... then she continued to watch Jake's eyes as he read her mind.</p> <p>It didn't take too many moments until they were finished eating, and Sarah had brought them both fresh coffee as Jake said his goodnights. His eyes were never going to let up and his heart was beating so fast. She felt herself begin to stir. She was very aware of him looking at her as she drank her coffee. The smile she gave him seemed to be just a little bit more than an expression of contentment as he knew she was having a hard time keeping her eyes on him. Her face looked beautiful to him, her hair just long enough to be swept back on that beautiful pony-tail. He felt his body heat up as he felt himself get hard. He was afraid that she would see and know.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about having a threesome with you ever since you woke up" Sarah said to him. She had thought this for a long time now. As a young girl she had told him she fantasized about two guys fucking her with their cocks, but only in the very limited way that it could ever be. In the meantime, she had had a steady boyfriend since she and the guy had known each other, but they had not been very discreet in the bedroom. She felt her body warming up and wanted to have him in her ass right there at the coffee table right then.</p> <p>"What are you thinking about?" Jake asked her.</p> <p>She reached over and put her hand on his thigh, "Well, I have always like to feel a cock in my ass.
