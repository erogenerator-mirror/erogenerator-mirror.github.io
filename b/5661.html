I could have asked her, you know." she said nervously.</p> <p>"Of course you could. I could have asked her. This is way over too much for you. I don't want to do something that will affect your plans. I want you to make an offer. I want you to offer me your services. I want you to put your entire life savings into it, while you're here, and then I'll be the one to keep doing you my entire life." John said forcefully.</p> <p>Her face reddened but she remained quiet.</p> <p>John went to her and hugged her and kissed her roughly. Pulling back he said "Are you serious?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes I am. It's just, I can't go on like this. I don't feel right. This could get me into a lot of trouble." she said.</p> <p>"Why?" he asked.</p> <p>"Because, I will be gone for the next few hours." she replied.</p> <p>John gave her a quick kiss and left.</p> <p>It felt like a long wait to get to his.</p> <p>He felt as if he was going to burst as he got home and found nothing but thoughts of the upcoming rendezvous already on his mind. He got in the shower and quickly washed away all of the anxiety that had gotten buried. After drying off, he went and got dressed. He got into his car that he had brought over to see Sarah but he decided that if she saw him coming up to John's, he would wait until they got back to the house so they wouldn't see each other again.</p> <p>It was almost 8pm and time to go get up at her mother's house. He was still feeling weak and in a desperate mood because of Sarah's presence and she was so beautiful and sexy. But it seemed like her mother wouldn't even recognize him at the door.</p> <p>John knocked on the door of his parent's bedroom just before 9:30pm and Sarah opened it right away. There looking at her like the cat she is. She walked towards him and threw her arms around him in a tight hug. She kissed her daughter on the cheek and left without another word.</p> <p>As soon as she walked out the door John started to sob as he ran to his room as fast as he could in hopes of falling asleep.</p> <p>He lay on the bed feeling sorry for himself. His heart ached and his body ached for her to love him just as she did. He would need to do something.</p> <p>But then he remembered where he was and got up. He went to his bathroom and turned on the light which felt cool against his bare skin. Walking back to his room he undressed and tossed his clothes into the hamper, and then he sat in a chair opposite his own bed. As he took his shoes off and laid back down he tried to think of anything else besides Sarah's sweet lips on his. Maybe the day had gone by so smoothly. Maybe he was in love with her and he was going to come back to her. But for some reason he felt guilty about the thing that was happening, but at the same time a wave of sadness rushed over him then as he went to sleep he didn't feel guilty. He slept for what seemed forever.</p> <p>John came to in the middle of the day and saw that his parents were sitting on the couch waiting for him. He thought he would say something to them, but after he came into the room he noticed the sadness in his mother's face which made him feel bad. He walked over to them and stood as close to his parent's face as he dared. "What's the matter mom?" John asked softly trying to soothe his mom which she seemed to hate.</p> <p>He felt tears start to well up in his eyes and he held his breath trying to slow them down. "Are you okay Dad?" John asked but when he got no response he spoke with a more gentle tone. "Sarah, I didn't mean anything by that." John said.</p> <p>"It was nothing son." Sarah said but still didn't speak.</p> <p>"Sarah, please don't go crying at your mother. You did very well today." dad said as John felt his stomach lurch in sympathy for his daughter.</p> <p>"Mom, we don't have to do anything. You're family now and you're not hiding anything from me, dad." Sarah said almost begging him to stop crying.</p> <p>John smiled with his mom's help. "I won't lie to you." John said. "I guess I'm not all that comfortable with it."</p> <p>"What? Is that all?" dad asked.</p> <p>"No. I mean yes. No, you're not hiding anything from me but I don't think I should tell you that. No, this isn't a conversation between us." John said still holding his breathâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
