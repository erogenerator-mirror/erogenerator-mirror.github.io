Her fingers stroked their thumb across the screen while she read her email. Sam picked up the phone and pushed the play button. She stared at the screen as the email began, reading it quickly as she continued stroking her tits.</p> <p>Her hand moved up and rubbed her nipple again as her other hand worked her pussy lips. Slowly she lowered the phone and held it to her chest, letting her fingers graze across her clit as the text began again. Sam's eyes met hers as she began reading the message for herself.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Sam felt her pussy tremble with arousal as she read the text from the man she loved more then ever. Her hands felt warm over her skin as her fingers teased her erect nipples. Sam's eyes closed as her pussy grew wet at the thought of the man she loved. She couldn't wait to get inside his hot mouth.</p> <p>Sam's body flushed with need as the email message came back to her. Her head dropped to her phone to hold her breath as her hand went back to her pussy. The hand on her nipple slid down as her fingers worked her clit, causing her to pant. Sam couldn't wait to slip her fingers into the hot juices of pleasure.</p> <p>"What type of lingerie do you like?" Sam's voice was soft to her ear as she typed, trying once again to relax her body.</p> <p>"How do you know what type?" Sam asked again, her breath coming quicker as she thought about it.</p> <p>"I like the kind you like," Sam replied, her fingers working against her clit once again.</p> <p>Sam's body was so turned on as her fingers worked the clit, as her mind raced in anticipation for the meeting she was going to tonight. Sam was torn whether she wanted to meet the man she knew, or whether she wanted to spend tonight alone with her fingers in her hot pussy.</p> <p>Sam bit her bottom lip and smiled as the thought crossed her mind. Sam didn't want to be the one to ask the man in question for her next shopping encounter, in case any of their friends were here. Sam's heart was pounding and she was panting as she hit the button, her nipples straining outward as her palm came down across her breasts.</p> <p>Sam's finger came up in a quick touch as her mind kept thinking of the mystery man. Sam's hand worked one hand down her stomach and slowly slid over to her pussy. Her other hand gripped her nipple with the warmth of her palm. Sam's hips bucked slightly with excitement, as her finger dipped lower into her wet pussy. Sam's lips parted slightly as she rubbed her clit with her finger, her thumb rubbing her nipple.</p> <p>Sam bit her lip with delight as she felt her body react to her soft touch. Sam continued to tease her nipples as her hips moved faster, rubbing faster against her own hand as her mind whirled. Sam reached up with a free hand and pinched the nipple she was pinching. Her back arched as her pussy clamped around her finger as cum hit her.</p> <p>Sam's hips went from one motion to another as her finger dipped deep. Sam's fingers pinched her nipple tighter, pushing her closer. Sam's head lifted slightly as her body exploded with another of the most intense orgasms and sent her off. The two sets of hands came crashing over her body, her legs trembling and trembling as she held the phone to her chest. With each touch of her body, her fingers released each nipple and brought back to life.</p> <p>"My god," Sam whispered softly as her hips continued to grind against her hand.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" She heard the man in the room next to her say at the same time she heard the door close.</p> <p>Sam let out a groan as she sat up. She reached inside the pocket of her sweatshirt, pulling out a small gift wrapped box. Sam reached inside the box and pulled the wrapping from its box, finding a small gift wrapped box, not one he own.</p> <p>"I got the box today from a friends box. I found the box by accident," Sam said through the box.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" Sam was puzzled by her question.</p> <p>Sam opened the box and the thin black fabric held two beautiful gold necklaces. The necklaces are worn and wrapped around each other, their intricate designs woven around each necklobe. Sam had never known love could bring something into a place so beautiful.</p> <p>Sam reached into the box and pulled out a gold necklace attached to a piece of the necklace. Sam held the necklace out to the woman watching her as Sam pulled the necklace up, then off her neck.</p> <p>Sam leaned forward to pick up a pearl bracelet off the necklace.
