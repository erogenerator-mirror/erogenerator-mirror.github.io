"I want you to fuck me, David."</p> <p></p> <p>In a flash he had her up against the tree, spreading her legs as he moved his head to her cunt. He buried his face in her bush as he moved his cock to her wet opening. She felt his hard cock enter her opening and she gasped at the sensation. As her lips wrapped around the head of his cock, she felt him pull it out slightly then slowly push it back in again. By the third slow deep thrust she had to break her hold on his cock because it felt as if he would split her apart. The last time had been when he used his hands to hold her hips tightly as he moved back and forth. She could feel a new pleasure when he thrust forward and it sent sparks through her. "Oh yes, David. That's that. Fuck me, baby. Fuck me harder," she moaned almost breathlessly.</p> <p></p> <p>David picked up the pace with his thrusting, and soon was fucking her steadily. He was in a hurry to get to the point that it was almost not really fucking but just using her body as a human vibrator. He felt her legs tighten around him tightly when she felt him suddenly shudder and grow deeper insider her. She felt him cum within her as wave after wave of pleasure coursed through her body.</p> <p></p> <p>Dinner over, they gathered their clothes together and began to dress. With a lingering kiss, they walked the remaining distance to their dorm room and climbed into bed together. "I love you, David," Marlene said to him as they fell asleep. "I hope it never ends, but I'm always looking for new experiences with you. You have changed so much in a short time," she murmured to him in her sleep. "I can't wait to have you in my life."</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 13</p> <p></p> <p>The next morning when they arrived at the University they were shocked to find that there was a woman sitting on the porch of the dormitory. Marlene had expected that they were being observed from the window but, instead, she saw the person sitting there on the porch, who had a glass of orange juice. A moment later, she found her cell phone on one of her kitchen tables and answered. Within a minute, she had found David in his bed as he sat down on the bed with Marlene. The next thing she knew she was lying there with him.</p> <p></p> <p>While they rested and decided what the next course of action was going to be, Marlene decided that she needed to do something with David. She pulled her panties off and stepped into her bed. "David, I need you to sleep on the floor tonight, okay?" she said, as she took his hand and led him to her bed. As he sat on the bed next to her, she pulled his face to her for a quick kiss. "Are you in the mood?" she asked. "No, not yet," he replied.</p> <p></p> <p>Marlene had been having a hard time sleeping in her clothes. She had woken up with her panties still on, so she slipped over and started to roll them down his legs and step out of them. "David, you are one of a kind," she chuckled softly. She had seen David naked once in college, but she could never find the courage to do anything like that. She thought about how she wanted him to feel her up. David had been a little embarrassed when he came down to school that night, but she had just assumed that he preferred men to women. As she pulled the panties down his legs she wondered briefly where he had learned how to perform oral sex on a woman. But, he had said that he had been practicing it when he went to school.</p> <p></p> <p>"You have the most wonderful pussy," she told him, looking down at hers. "Did you have fun while I was gone?" she asked, as she pulled her nightie on.</p> <p></p> <p>"I had fun," he laughed. "And I have one more surprise for you." He reached down and pulled her dress off.</p> <p></p> <p>"Get that off quick! Why did you take it off earlier? Didn't you like it?" she demanded when she saw him standing in front of her with two small silver rings sticking out from his fingers.</p> <p></p> <p>"Sorry, I got carried away," he said. "But I think that makes things easier. Go ahead and do it."</p> <p></p> <p>As Marlene stood there, trying to decide what to do, he leaned forward and kissed her firmly on the lips. She pulled his head closer and met his lips with hers. As they kissed, he pulled her dress off over her head and tossed it aside then reached down to undo her bra. She helped, and it fell to the ground. She pulled his head in to her chest, and he could feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
