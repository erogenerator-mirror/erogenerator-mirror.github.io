"So who is that guy?" I asked.</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"My first husband," he said, and with that, I knew.</p> <p>Not wanting to ruin any of this for him, I didn't bring him out. "What kind of guy," I asked, with my heart set on a path to reconciliation and forgiveness. "What do you mean?"</p> <p>"He's a nice guy," I said. "And he's a nice young guy, too."</p> <p>"Weird, isn't it?"</p> <p>"I guess," I had to laugh, because he had a big smile on his face even as he responded. "So what? He's not your first guy. Not even your second, anyway."</p> <p>"Who, me?" he asked.</p> <p>"You're my first in a great long time -- even longer that you've been with the wrong guy," I replied -- and then added, "If you had a second in the way, you already had a great guy in the way of me with a great body."</p> <p>He laughed again, and that caused me to smile.</p> <p>"And you've been with a guy? Really?" he said, looking at me with his own smile.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's not a big deal. I know it's not," I answered, and then added, "But I was with another lucky guy before we met."</p> <p>"And you like doing all the work!" he said.</p> <p>I laughed, and then said, "Yeah. I like what we did together." After all, my "relationship" with my ex wasn't exactly long. It had its ups and downs involved and wasn't necessarily "normal" or "hot," but we were still friends, so I just went along.</p> <p>"Hmmm, let's try out his dick," he said. "I mean, he had a nice cock and I'd really like to suck him. That'll definitely be good for some other times."</p> <p>"How do you want to do it?" I said, pulling my hair back from my face.</p> <p>"Go to his room, get his things and bring them back home," he said.</p> <p>I thought for a moment. "Okay," I said. "How about you?"</p> <p>"Sure," he said. "But, not here. He's my roommate and we've got a lot to talk about."</p> <p>"I can't do this. I don't want to get into a fight with him," I said.</p> <p>"Really?" he asked. "I'm not interested in you and just do what you want with your pussy," he said with a laugh.</p> <p>My heart stopped for a moment, wondering what I had just done. Before I could even begin to think about what I had just said, he continued. "Not that you can't come to his room for one reason and a second, okay? Maybe I can just be a third, and you'll never have to leave your room again."</p> <p>"No, don't think about that," I said, "I don't want to make that decision. And you'll have to promise not to do it again."</p> <p>"Promise," he said as he grabbed my hand and led me to his room.</p> <p>When we got there, he unlocked the door and I went in first. In the room were a couple of sheets of paper. After I sat on one of the beds and read his email, I turned back to his email. After a little bit of reading, and then a question mark, I read more of the email.</p> <p>When I began to read, he started to say, "You can be my third in a long time ..." and then, "You can be my fourth. You can be my fifth, and all the rest will be fun." I felt as if I were in that situation because I didn't want to be his fifth.</p> <p>My thoughts just kept spinning and I thought about how far I had gone with him, and how I was going to lose everything to him. Finally, I thought about getting away, but then I figured if I could stay and get away with it on my own, I wasn't going to let my new roommate ruin my plans for the rest of my life.</p> <p>"This isn't going to solve anything but what's wrong with us getting along," he said. "Just you and me and what we can do."</p> <p>"Okay, but you can always use the bed," I replied.</p> <p>"I already did," he replied. "And I love spending time with you."</p> <p>"Okay," Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
