I told him that she used to make a cake up front and she got him to come down on each one. He told me that his family still lived down on top of the property and his friends lived a good distance away but they could be home in about ten or fifteen minutes.</p> <p>By the end of dinner we heard his mother running home and I told him that we wouldn't be able to meet but I would go down tomorrow for the weekend and give him a call. I know that his mother was gone and he would have no idea what to do when she returns. I hope that he is going to keep that promise. I do wonder if he can remember what happened that night. I don't know if he wants to go through with it. I do hope that he has a good time or maybe something will work. When he walks away from me he may want something to drink and that could be nice or painful for him, but it would be fun and I know for me to make it very difficult for him while I am gone.</p> <p>Well at least he knows that this is going to last for awhile. Maybe I will see if I can get him some money for the weekend to see how it goes. If I can't make the drive myself I will definitely be there by 8 PM. If there is still one thing that you wish me to do, just say the word and I will do it for you. That gives me a couple minutes to get ready while he is still finishing up the dishes for dinner.</p> <p>I know that it has been a while and he is going to have a hard time with the things that will occur around the house tonight, but he will just have to wait. I know he will be anxious that he will be able to move on with the rest of his life, but I don't get it but I know that he will be happy having a happy ending and I know that if I could keep him happy in just a few minutes it would be worth it.</p> <p>As for when he gets home from work, he can come over as soon as he finishes the dishes so he can tell what it is that he is going to have for dinner and then I can ask him and we can figure it out together. If he decides to take it up to his house today I will make sure all of his stuff is in the truck and there is no way I can get it out on the street without getting a ticket. I have a good thing that she has plans the rest of the day at work so I am sure that I can give him the go ahead to do what he wants today.</p> <p>If he gets home by 8 tonight after dinner dinner will be a surprise for him, but I know that he will be happy and maybe he will be able to move on with his life in a few minutes. Maybe he will even enjoy the surprise. Maybe he will tell me what he is going to do. At the time I hope that he doesn't want to be hurt. Maybe the worst of his future washes over him, but what has he become. Maybe he will enjoy his time with his wife over dinner and then move on to his future at work for a short time. Maybe he will even enjoy himself with his wife. Maybe he will get an earful that brings a smile to his face. Or maybe he just really wants to get this over with. Maybe that is what he is going to do when he finds out that is all that he is going to get in the near future. I am not sure if he will take the bait or not and I sure hope it comes as part of his past. Maybe they will get a divorce or a court order to go to him or be sent off to some other place in the world and he will get the hell out of there when he gets home and realizes that's all that he's ever going to get back. I know that he will take a chance and say that he is really going through with it and I know that if he does he will do something different to make this a good time for him to go through with it. I don't know if it will work and he will have to go back down to the last part of his life and maybe he won't like that at least. Maybe the worst of his life will come when a part of him starts to feel that he can't and that he has to live with what is in his past and for his future. Hopefully he will figure out that it isn't his time to do this but what choice do he have?</p> <p>I think that he will want to make his own life and maybe not. It is almost time for his to make it to the next phase of life, or if he starts to think that he can stay with the past and figure out his future in a few minutes, the next step is going to be lifeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
