I'll probably have to have to use this when I get back to my room."</p> <p>"I'll bet..."</p> <p>"Don't stop on my account, lover."</p> <p>He reached over and unzipped my shorts and took them off. He leaned down and took my bare cock into his mouth. He sucked and stroked and made me feel as if I were in heaven. I thought he would just pull out right there, and suck me again. Then he sat up and slowly un-tucked my shorts.</p> <p>"Can we get out of these?" I asked as I kicked them off. My shorts and briefs were down around my ankles on the grass.</p> <p>"Maybe. When I get home I want to make some more memories."</p> <p>"You're all mine!"</p> <p>He stood up, pulled his shorts and underwear down and stepped out of them. Now standing there in all his glory standing in front of me dressed as I was, my cock bouncing between my legs, I felt like I was in heaven. I couldn't believe how hard I was! Then he moved over to me and lay down on my cock, which was still in the soft sand. Then he spread his legs and told me to hold him. I held him and felt his body trembling as his cock stiffened until it swelled at the last moment.</p> <p>"What a cock that is," I said.</p> <p>"Honey, you're very thick. I have never known such an incredible organ. I have never felt anything like it. It's like heaven."</p> <p>"That's because you're an amazing lover. I have never felt anything so right."</p> <p>We lay there together for a short while until he said, "I want it to stay that way. You are amazing."</p> <p>"I hope to make you feel every bit as magnificent as that."</p> <p>"We can do the same for you tonight, too."</p> <p>"I'm up for another round. You know what I like."</p> <p>I kissed him and said, "I'm ready."</p> <p>We dressed and got back in the water and had another beer. We had another round of drinks when he announced we were ready to head back. We got back into the boat and she got the blankets out on the back of the boat.</p> <p>"Oh, I almost forgot about this," she said as we climbed back onto the boat. "Your legs are killing me."</p> <p>"Do you want to rub your arms and legs?"</p> <p>"I'm fine. I know it's not as uncomfortable as you think."</p> <p>"Just stay in the water, I'll bring you some more beer."</p> <p>"Thanks. I'll be right back." We were on our way back to the harbor where I was going to give myself another bath.</p> <p>On the way back I had a thought I had. "Hey. What have you got planned for tonight?"</p> <p>"You'll see."</p> <p>"Where are we going then?" I had always wanted to spend some time alone.</p> <p>"We've come to a decision. If you can't go, maybe I can."</p> <p>"OK, fine. Let's go." We headed home.</p> <p>On the way, I thought about what I had just said and how I would respond to him, and how we could make the most of it. In the back of my mind, I wanted us to continue the sexual relationship we had. It was the only way, and I liked every minute of it. My cock was hard and ready to spring free.</p> <p>We arrived at the house where we took the blankets and put them into the laundry bag. Then we went out onto the deck and stood by the fire, not saying anything. He turned on some water and we both sat down on the blanket. He leaned over to the bottle of wine.</p> <p>"I'm just going to lay down out here. I want you to do this for me today."</p> <p>"How sweet. I will have a nice long shower to wash off my energy."</p> <p>"You're not letting me have time to enjoy your company all morning," I said, as I took the bottle from him.</p> <p>"I can feel how relaxed you are. I feel like I could stay the whole day at the resort."</p> <p>"That's sweet," I told him. "I'll just sit here by the fire letting you dry me off." I sat beside him and we kissed. We kissed just for a moment and then I reached over his shoulder and brought my hand down and gave him my hand. He touched it and gave me a smile. Then he was gently rubbing his palm over his chest while his other hand went backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
