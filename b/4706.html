God!!! Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! My GOD!!!!" he groaned as his cum pumped out of his cock, bathing my tongue in warm, salty juices that tasted sweet. I sucked away, swallowing all of it, and as I felt it run down around my nose, I swallowed loudly to encourage him to continue to pump his wad of come on his own face, which he began to caress. Then he slowly pulled my head away, and he rolled over, laying next to me as I tried to catch my breath.</p> <p>When he pulled himself away from his face, he turned and looked at me. His face looked tired and tired. I watched his lips curl slightly, but he spoke softly, but with a smile. "I've never been with anyone as good as you, and I knew I needed to try."</p> <p>I didn't see a smile or laugh, but I could feel the excitement from him filling my ears and my stomach. I was glad this was over.</p> <p>"It's the least I can do for you. I could not wait to get you back up again, and again, and again." He kissed me deeply, then pulled back, looking at me "What is that last thing you said?"</p> <p>I giggled; "I just knew you would have me, but not before I got you out of your shell."</p> <p>He kissed me again, "Well, I guess I would be ready to go again anyway, although I don't think you will mind, I just want to make sure, OK?"</p> <p>Again, I had to agree with him. He kissed the top of my head and rolled over. "Let's go, you got a good thing for me."</p> <p>He had a nice voice, which was nice, but I was never really into it with any other women, other than when others were close, so I really did not like the sound of them being around. He had a nice accent, English, maybe Spanish, as well as lots of good diction I could not place. My guess was that he moved in a good way, and I liked that too. My only real thought was to enjoy his voice until some of his charm was broken or died with age.</p> <p>We ate our meal, and then went to sleep. We both had a great day ahead.</p> <p>We woke late the next morning to the sounds of the waves, the sun starting to come up. It was a perfect summer day, with a very clear day, with beautiful colors. It was just after twelve, and it felt like it had just dropped over a hundred feet onto the water. It felt like it had been at least a quarter mile deep on the other side of the mountain, at least at the top. Our bodies were warm and wet under the covers. I was wearing a long sleeved cotton nightgown and a very low cut baby doll, which was open at the top, and I had a lot of cleavage in it. He must not have noticed, because he didn't look like he was taking note of my body. He looked over, and saw that I was wearing only my panties, which are open at the front. He smiled.</p> <p>"It's cold to me!" he exclaimed, "but not nearly as cold as it's going to be today."</p> <p>I looked over to kiss him on his cheek, and he turned it into a big hug. "I like what you're wearing today, and you look lovely in it," he said gently.</p> <p>I felt a lot better as well; "What do you normally do in your day off?"</p> <p>"Just read, do a lot of reading and writing, but I'm writing a very short story for you, by the way!"</p> <p>"It is very hot this time of year!" I said, "and not hot for a woman's body!"</p> <p>"I'm in the middle of my story, and you're right, it's a good story!"</p> <p>He didn't reply at first, just lifted my head up to kiss me. I felt his mouth enclose mine, and we kissed passionately. I was pleased to find him really good at kissing, and I found myself responding with a little of my own.</p> <p>After much kissing, he pulled me down, pushed me over toward the bed, and I was laying over the edge, legs still wide open. He got up, got his shirt off, and removed his shoes and socks, revealing long, lean muscle covered legs and strong thighs. He removed his pants and underwear and lay back on the foot of the bed, his eyes closed as he leaned over. He slowly ran his hands up and down my legs on the way to my thighs, which he began with, rubbing lightly.</p> <p>I was getting excited almost by the time his hands began to move toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
