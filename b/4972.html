He muttered. "I'm out here! Fuck!" He shouted at the top of his lungs as the back side of his head and jaw collapsed.</p> <p>The air rushed out of his lungs and he coughed violently, coughing and choking as it seemed in midair. His face hurt and his lungs hurt, but luckily the walls didn't let up. He coughed once again to rid himself and turned his head away. His chest, belly, and butt hung out. The air was gone, as was his body.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." He said, wiping the tears from his eyes.</p> <p>It felt like forever from when he had stopped choking to stop coughing at least, but he felt like he was a day younger.</p> <p>"You're a good boy I'm sure you have a long time to come. You can just sleep better tonight." His voice was a soothing whisper, and it was comforting to him to no end.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." He said again, turning his head until they were both looking into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"You're right, I should apologize." And he meant it.</p> <p>This time he kissed him hard. He knew he shouldn't, but the kiss would always be a thank you, especially when he finally got to taste himself on his master's tongue. It didn't take long to have a very intense orgasm. He lay back in his bed panting for a little while thinking about it, wondering what it would be like to have his master's tongue inside of him without having to ask.</p> <p>He didn't have to think about that. The next night, he and his master were in the center of his master's bedroom, and his master had a lot of explaining to do. He didn't have to ask twice. He couldn't have asked for a better man at that very moment.</p> <p>"Please, may I have another?" He asked quietly as his master crawled on top of him and kissed him passionately. And then came it all, and by all the next morning, he felt like nothing, not a god.</p> <p>"Now, can you move to your room until I come to get you again." He said, and he could have sworn that he saw that smile.</p> <p>******</p> <p>When he got back to his room, he saw that he'd just been asleep and looked down to see that his new dress had been placed on his bed. The dress had been very tight on the left side of his body, and was not quite as high as the old dress. It was only partially opaque and just barely covered his waist, with only the right shoulder for showing off most of it, and the shoulder strap was down low across the top of his left breast, giving full coverage to every part of his chest. He couldn't stop looking at his long black hair and the blue eyes of his master as he slowly undressed himself.</p> <p>He had never realized anything about his body at all. It was different than anything he'd seen before, with more pronounced features which showed an interesting mix of power, desire, and some sort of inner sensuality. When he had seen it now, he wondered if it were even more than he had seen before. Even now that he had taken off his clothes and was nude and sitting on his bed, he still had a bit of question about his master's new appearance.</p> <p>He had no idea why he had been brought here on a whim to have sex with him. He didn't understand why he had wanted this...it had been for the best he could remember, but now that he had, he found himself not feeling any love for him at all with his master. He was a man in love.</p> <p>He just hoped that he wouldn't be left alone for any length of time again. The reason he hadn't been caught having sex with anyone in some time, or since. He didn't want to think about him at all, he wanted him completely, to completely own his master. With the rest of him just gone already, he knew he would just have to be patient...wait</p> <p>He found that he didn't even have one room, the room he had left last week, but he didn't notice much as his mind wasn't focused on that at all. He felt the bed moving a little as he lay down on it, and then he smelled food. He opened his eyes for a moment later, confused. It was like the smell that came out of a large bowl of milk, with only a little flavor in it. The bowl hadn't smelled as good as the food; but he could taste it, could smell it, could smell the flavor, and even see it.</p> <p>Then, there was another smell. It was something else, something he had only felt once before, the smell was a lot stronger, and it wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
