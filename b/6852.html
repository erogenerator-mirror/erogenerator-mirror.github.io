"Your turn." I said, as she started to rise and sit up.</p> <p>"Yeah, you know your thing." She said, smiling down at me.</p> <p>I kissed her and felt her respond to me. She didn't just press herself onto me, she let her breasts grind against me. I reached under with both arms and rolled her on top of me. Our breasts were close together, but not quite enough. She took one in each hand and pushed her breasts up against my body, pressing her nipples into my breasts, as I rolled her on top of me.</p> <p>We lay there like that for a moment. I could feel her hips grinding against me again. Her nipples were hard and I could feel them pressing into my body. I rolled her on top of me, still feeling her hips grinding in small circles against my bare breast. I turned her over and she got up on her knees, resting her breasts on my chest.</p> <p>I could feel her vagina pushing down against my hand but could not get into it. I wanted to get my hand inside of her. But, I knew she had something very special planned in mind. "What you have is special," I said, looking down towards her sex which I could easily make out.</p> <p>"Well, we can do it if you want." She said, as she slid down and got underneath her and pressed her mouth down on mine and kissed me deeply. She slid my pants off my hips.</p> <p>I could feel her warm breath on my skin. I wanted to reach up and put my mouth to her and feel her lips on mine. I reached down, feeling her soft lips on mine, and as my hand felt the length of her body, she wrapped my fingers around my throbbing sex. I felt the lips of her vagina against the fingers of my hand. It was so soft, yet so hot. She put her lips to mine and kissed me hungrily. Her hands gripped my shoulders as she let her body slide down mine. The feeling of her soft breasts rubbing against me, as she sat on my lap, was unbelievable.</p> <p>I felt my excitement rise. She leaned forward and started kissing me again, moving her hands further down. "Do you like that?" she asked. She put her hands under both of my breasts and started to rub them together.</p> <p>"Oh, my God," I said, "I have never felt like that before." She rolled herself over on top of me again and kissed me passionately this time. She pulled me towards her by my breasts and my hands went to her hips.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked, not taking her mouth off my mouth, but continuing to kiss me. I could feel her body pressing against my own now. I felt her nipples against me. I didn't have to tell her I knew the answer to that.</p> <p>"Yes, I am sure. I am sure. I have never felt as wet inside as I do right now." I said, as I felt her vagina rubbing against my fingers. I slid my finger over her lips. It wasn't as wet as she had been expecting, just enough to tell that I was moving my finger over it. I could feel myself moistening even more as she moved against me. I reached down and pressed myself between her breasts and ran my finger down her slit and lightly along her lips. I felt a small wetness inside. She parted her legs and my finger found her vagina, pushing inside her. I felt as warm and silky as I could imagine.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're all right with me?" she repeated, her voice sounding shaky. I felt as though she didn't know if I was really talking to her. I just wanted to feel my finger inside of her again. "If you want it, let me know," I whispered, my voice sounding almost desperate.</p> <p>"Okay." She nodded. "But I have to get back." She left my mouth, but kept talking, "I'm not sure I can make it back to the room before dinner tonight, is that okay?" I thought to myself, "What have I missed out on."</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
