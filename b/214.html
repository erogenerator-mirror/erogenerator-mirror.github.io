I think I really enjoyed fucking you today, and all you did with it was tease my cock."</p> <p>"It seemed to be working."</p> <p>We got up to shower and dress again, and found something I liked to call a dress bag, which we used on the road.</p> <p>"I'm going to go to a beach resort for the week, and we're going to do this on a picnic; you need a nice dress."</p> <p>We were getting ready to leave the house around 5.30, and he picked up a book from my bag and headed home to pack it for two. My bag didn't seem to fit so he carried it upstairs. He was going to be in town this weekend, but we could go do some shopping. My car was at the curb by then so we picked up our clothing and got in my Suburban, and headed for the beach.</p> <p>We found a relatively private beach, surrounded by trees and a small patch of land, but there were no lights inside, as the sand around it only illuminated one area, making it difficult to see into. We did end up staying out for an hour but were tired when the sun broke over the horizon, and the sun and our car started moving along it. In the shade, he set down his bag with the beach towel to keep from sunburn. I put my top on, and he put in his top. We both pulled the top over our heads and walked off the beach, heading for our cars. We headed for the car with our bags under our arms and headed back to my place. We arrived at my place about 6.00pm, and set down in my bed. We were almost naked as we kissed and caressed each other slowly, but with very little passion. I was getting to know his cock and balls as we kissed, and was wondering how soon we could explore him fully. I found a small bottle of lotion at my beach bag and applied a liberal amount to his cock as my hand rubbed and stroked him. His hands were on me, exploring, pulling me deeper into the kiss while we continued. We continued to kiss, enjoying the moment, until he pulled away, stood up, leaned over and whispered, "You have to get ready. You need to go back to your hotel and change, I'll meet you around 7 p.m. at a restaurant, OK?"</p> <p>"Yes Sir!"</p> <p>"Well, be there soon," I said as I walked to the shower.</p> <p>I was in the shower when the door to my bungalow opened. The door to my suite was open, and I was still in the shower, when the door to my room opened, and there was Kevin, again. This time, however, he was topless and his cock was still partially erect.</p> <p>"What did you think, honey?" I heard him say. "You are a sexy looking woman, I love it!"</p> <p>He stepped into my shower and quickly washed me. He took off his clothes and came out to clean my hair and sooth my skin, his hands working me up to the point of near orgasm. When he came, he washed my breasts as his fingers gently probed. I had an orgasm of no physical consequence; it was a pleasure I wouldn't have expected. I looked down and found him watching me.</p> <p>"Did I do OK for you this morning, honey?"</p> <p>"You did a fabulous job." He kissed me on the cheek and walked over to a chair to sit down. He opened my legs, and pulled them to his chest.</p> <p>"Your legs are very wet, and your pussy has gotten very swollen this morning." I felt his hard cock against my leg. I reached down and felt it too. It was very slick with juice, and I began to rub it up and down as I looked down at him. He was watching me, and I could tell how turned on he was. He told me that he wanted me to join him in bed the next day, but I was going home for the weekend on vacation, not at the beach again, so he was free at any time.</p> <p>"I can't sleep with you tonight, as I have a work meeting; but you are very welcome to come to my hotel room."</p> <p>"OK"</p> <p>"And you can do a lot of exploring as soon as you get here."</p> <p>As my son's hands moved on my breasts and clit, I knew he was going to fuck me today. We were going to have some fun today. He had the afternoon off, he had meetings all day, and he was free to play with my body. I agreed to that plan. We went to sleep with a smile on our faces.</p> <p>Saturday morningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
