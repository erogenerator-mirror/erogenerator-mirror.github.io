We reached her door and made small talk as she opened the door to let us in. My face was red with embarrassment as we walked up to the counter to pay and I took her hand to guide me into the kitchen to the main room and set the check down before stepping into the bedroom to get a change of clothes.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I'm still so embarrassed." She said kissing my cheek.</p> <p>"Don't be. I'm quite proud of you. The compliment was certainly appreciated."</p> <p>I had a hard time saying a thing in spite of her beautiful green eyes. As I dressed I felt awkward. There are so many things that I can't say to someone for who I really am. But, at the same time, I needed to protect and be proud of her and what she is capable of going through, not so little and so strong.</p> <p>I had never met anyone like her before. I knew for a fact that she had never been with anyone else. I knew she had dated just after high school and that she wasn't in her final year of her junior year. All she had was a grade point average and her grades were not very good. On the surface she seemed very intelligent and bright. But, I really loved her and her looks. But, on the deep, soft and caring side of her, I know that I will be damned if I can ever be her lover.</p> <p>I pulled out my wallet and looked around for something to cover my shoes and walked over and sat down on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?" I asked as I started to pull on my shoes.</p> <p>"Yes, thank you." Her voice was soft as her eyes looked up from the top of her head to my face.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I can't tell you the rest of it, or tell you anything that you would like to know about me." I said taking up the slack on her shoes.</p> <p>"Doing this for you?"</p> <p>"I guess so."</p> <p>"I think we both like the music. I could sit and listen to this for hours. After all, you should also think about whether or not you are getting paid to do something with me."</p> <p>"Yes, I suppose I was thinking the same thing. I'll take you up on that though."</p> <p>I started to do the same. I didn't want to say the thing to her and probably end the relationship at any cost. I didn't really think it mattered. The only thing that I knew that mattered to me was that I had her blessing to have the time off, that she would be happy with me for what I had done and that I would be with her. It seemed like a simple thing, what would the future hold for the three of us? It was simple and I didn't want to say anything too hard or negative. I wanted to say that if her grades dropped off again I would give her time off with me. I hoped she felt the same way. But, my mind said that she wasn't ready to go that fast and I felt that she wasn't ready to have that happen at all. As I looked away I could see that she was smiling as I looked on looking for something to hide down below.</p> <p>As we walked to the counter I got a feeling of dreadfulness. "I have to say, the thought of having her for a change scares me."</p> <p>"I understand. I'm not ready to give up the chance to be with you, to be with you."</p> <p>We both shook in silence and her voice was a little softer.</p> <p>We walked back to the door in silence, which was fortunate considering that she had to use the bathroom. I turned my head and she gave me a kiss that felt like a lover that needed a kiss. But, unlike the kiss I'd shared with my friends, this kiss was as far along the border from sex as it could go. It took all of us both to get through that first kiss and we kept kissing for a good fifteen minutes before we got out of hand to finally have sex while the other people were talking.</p> <p>"I have to go back and change. If you need anything else, go get it."</p> <p>"I think we better do it out the side door." I said pulling her on to me as she got off of her feet and leading me into her bedroom.</p> <p>"Where is your clothes?"</p> <p>"In the dresser there, too."</p> <p>I put them into one of her drawers and headed to her closet to get them outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
