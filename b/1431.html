She wrapped her fingers around it and felt it getting harder and harder. She squeezed gently and looked at him in the eyes. John felt it; he knew she felt it, and he pushed her down against the counter, his hand pressing against the back of her head, his fingers gripping tightly onto her scalp. Her eyes closed as she felt him, feeling his hardness and heat, pushing its way into her mind. It made her gasp and she reached out with both hands, touching his face, feeling him.</p> <p>The moment the door closed behind them, his hand gripping her chin again, he was kissing her mouth. He drew back, his eyes locked on hers, and her mouth opened. The sight of her mouth on his; how it felt; her eyes; the way it moved. He'd made her come; she kissed him back. John wanted to feel her against him; he wanted her against him. And it would only get better. The moment he'd felt her hand on his shaft, the moment that had brought him so close to coming. And then it all left him...</p> <p>Chapter 8</p> <p>John moved down to her shoulders and then her neck; pulling a tight embrace, he felt her shudder. And then felt an answering shiver. John ran his hands down her breasts as if he didn't need them. He felt her nipples stiffen, and then he felt them swelling under his touch. He ran one hand over them, feeling her heat and her growing breath, then down her side... and he was on his knees between her legs, her body bent at the waist...</p> <p>They'd never been this close to each other. John leaned in and kissed her full on the lips, gently. They kissed for long minutes, each tasting the other, their fingers lightly pressing at the other's skin. He felt her body, as a sensual, sensual, erotic creature, yielding to his every touch. She'd tasted the wine, the food, and his hand in her mouth... she was delicious... John felt his hands move again, sliding down her back, his finger tips making long, smooth passes over her exposed skin.</p> <p>He moved down between her legs, her hands on his shoulders, her legs wrapping around his body. He moved his face downward; his breath catching a wet kiss on her exposed womanhood, his tongue running slowly along the length of it, his fingers stroking along its length, feeling the wet, warm texture of her swollen lips. His fingers stroked along the sides, making long, tight circles in her, feeling the smooth texture, the silky softness of her inner labia.</p> <p>She gasped and felt her eyes closing again as he touched her there, he teasingly circling her opening. But she didn't say anything, didn't open it for his fingers. He pressed them in as deep as they would go, felt the wetness of her hole, felt the small opening of it open, felt it's warmth spreading around them. He could only feel her heat in there. She moaned at the touch, so gentle. John looked at her, into her eyes. They were full, beautiful green pools, her pupils glistening. He wondered if there were depths, how depths he could possibly experience. The warmth and sweetness of it, the pleasure, the pleasure and the delight. He pulled her closer to him, feeling in his fingers for her entrance; he was ready.</p> <p>John's finger tips slipped inside of her, feeling the wetness that he'd imagined his own body to feel that day, the warmth and the moisture of her sex to his wrist. He'd made love to an angel. He slid one finger in, feeling the tightness and wetness of her; the wetness of her womanhood. He was going to take the pleasure... John knew he could take it.</p> <p>Their lips parted, almost like an act of passing, the sound of it escaping as the lips on the other's mouth moved, tongues entwined, eyes never parted. He felt the lips on his face, the breath of his own, as her voice became stronger, stronger, even as the passion of it was in his eyes. He felt her moving against him, moving against him... his eyes on hers, even as their mouths moved. It was all so beautiful, so perfect. He closed his eyes, his heart beating, feeling the joy in his whole body. And then he felt her legs opening a small bit, moving under his chin, her hands on his head. His fingers moved to her face, his face against her lips.</p> <p>'I will taste you, John.' She whispered, her voice like a gentle whisper in his ear. And when his lips met hers, he felt it. And it was all so wonderful, so sweet, so perfect. It felt wonderful.
