When she tried to free herself herself she couldn't budge and pulled herself up onto her knees, grabbing the sheet and pulling herself off of her back. She tried desperately to pull herself to her feet, but her legs were weak. She had a tough-tack-on to use if she wanted to stay alive.</p> <p>Heather was in a daze, her mind in a fog of mixed emotions as this guy took advantage of her. She couldn't move or speak. She was breathing hard.</p> <p>Heather found herself starting to cry. At first, she was scared that she would kill herself, but soon realized she couldn't. This was like a bad dream. Then, the tears really started coming.</p> <p>"You're killing yourself, aren't you?" she gasped as the tears streamed down her face. "I'll die!"</p> <p>Heather looked at her, her tears forming a big, wet, puckered line on her cheeks. "I really can't do anything about it," she sobbed, finally getting it out. "I can't. I got shot in the back . . ."</p> <p>The horror of being found out caused something in her to shudder all over. She couldn't have sex for a reason now, she thought, but not about it. Not even if this was all a weird nightmare. So she just stayed there, hoping there would be more to the nightmare and, if nothing else, just wait and see what he thought. She finally felt someone's arms wrap about her and she turned slightly away from the stranger.</p> <p>A gentle hand brushed over her shoulder. "Just hold tight," he whispered. "I'll be right back." Heather gave a small gasp and shuddered as her mind started to focus. The next thing Heather felt was a strong embrace wrapped around her tiny body, one hand covering her mouth while the other slid down her back and cupped her ass.</p> <p>"I can't wait any longer," the stranger said softly.</p> <p>Heather moaned as she felt his hands slide along her backside, caressing and touching each round firm globe. "Please stop," she moaned. "I can't! This is the worst!" She wiggled about as his fingertips found her anus, and once again, she felt something poking between her legs.</p> <p>With trembling hands, Heather began to move, feeling him tugging at her hips, pulling her hips back into his hand. She wasn't sure if he expected her to do this by herself, or if he had thought so himself or by some stranger. She had no idea. "Please," she pleaded again. "Please!" Heather was beginning to sweat even though the rain was cold. Her mind was racing and everything seemed spinning. She felt like she had no control over her body or brain. Her body was trying to make itself move, wanting something inside it, something that didn't even have to do with this. Yet, it was his hand touching her between her legs.</p> <p>The stranger took a step back and then she felt the sheet being pushed off her body. Heather let a moan slip as those slender hands reached towards her groin. "Wait," the stranger spoke, then lowered his head and took Heather's hand in his, pulling it up as he did. Heather gasped as the hand found her hard clit and began to rub. She could feel how slippery she was, a mix of herself and the stranger's juices. She'd never been touched like this before, and she didn't know where she was or who she was. The stranger's fingers stroked and rubbed furiously and then suddenly Heather let out a cry of pleasure.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhh," Heather cried, squeezing her body tight around the stranger's hand. "Oh God, I'm cumming!" Heather cried again, feeling the climax explode through her body and out onto the stranger's hand. Then the shock of realization hit her and as the orgasm ended, Heather gave a huge shudder, feeling her toes curl up and her hips jerking violently. "Ohhhhh!" Heather let out a long gasp, and then let out another. All at once, she relaxed her body and the person next to her stopped what they were doing, but not before giving an audible little cry of relief.</p> <p>"What the hell was that?" Heather asked herself.</p> <p>"It was you, isn't it?" she answered him. "I'm sorry if I embarrassed you."</p> <p>"No, you're not," Heather said softly. "I'm not embarrassed."</p> <p>"No, you're not." Heather lifted her hands from her crotch and began to push the stranger's hand away.</p> <p>"No. I'm sorry," Heather said again. "I'm so . . .
