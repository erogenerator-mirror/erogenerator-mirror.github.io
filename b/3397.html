Can I help you? If there's anything that might fit you we can talk."</p> <p>"Hi, my name is Sarah, I'm here with a girlfriend."</p> <p>My eyes widened slightly, "Oh, right. She's the other girl. Where's your girlfriend?"</p> <p>"My girlfriend and she's my little brother."</p> <p>"Oh...oh..." Sarah looked away and tried to put her head down.</p> <p>"She's just a friend." I gave it some thought. Then after a while he said," You could ask her, she's cute. Her name's Rebecca."</p> <p>"That is her name? This is a friend of yours?" Sarah sounded a little more interested, and I couldn't help but look a little embarrassed.</p> <p>"Sorry Sarah. I mean, she may be young and cute, but she is way too far down the road to hang on to anything."</p> <p>"Oh, right. Hi I'm Julie. I'm an old friend. We were all just friends back in school." I nodded.</p> <p>"Hi, how do you do? You look a little pale."</p> <p>"I'm Sarah." I turned to get my purse. I couldn't believe it was happening. Julie's eyes seemed to have lit up and I started to blush even more.</p> <p>"It's quite warm here! How about we go in here?"</p> <p>I was about to decline it when Sarah said, "Yeah, that's fine. Rebecca would be even more comfortable out back with us. It's so secluded that's so peaceful, doesn't it?"</p> <p>I looked around at the trees. The moon was half way down now, reflecting on the bright moonlight. I thought maybe we could be swimming back there. Julie's voice started to come back again, "What? You're not sure if it really is secluded. We don't swim there at all...oh, how cute."</p> <p>I started with a "Ok" as I looked around at all the nice places in the trees. I think I was getting nervous and kind of looked like I was scared. "Sarah,"</p> <p>"Of course, Julie. We'll just go slowly. We're friends, right?"</p> <p>"Well... Yes we are. Rebecca's not as young as you, so there's no harm in going with her." Sarah giggled at Julie's enthusiasm and added, "It's ok. I'll call her as soon as she gets here."</p> <p>Julie started to walk back, towards where the trees formed the back of the trees. "Do you boys have any idea what we're going to be doing? It could be quite crowded out back."</p> <p>"Nah," answered a third one that started to speak up, "But we have some ideas. For one thing, we could put some sunscreen on us before the sun gets up."</p> <p>"Yeah, that sounds good to me. But are you sure we should go right on over here? It's only been a couple of minutes." Sarah seemed as though she was excited and trying to decide if she wanted to go along. I knew that I should. She was shy and nervous, but also in a way more attractive than she was.</p> <p>"Trust us, we know where you can get a little sunscreen, but right now we have some to go." Julie walked over to the trees and knelt on the ground, while one of the others stood behind her. Julie spread some sunscreen on the guys and they started to do the same to me. When the sun came up, Julie turned and looked over her shoulder at me, before starting to rub lotion on my back, shoulders and back. I felt as though I was in the dark room watching something from the trees. I closed my eyes briefly; Sarah had a look of disappointment in her eyes, before her hand went under my bikini bottoms, and began to rub the lotion around my butt cheeks. I shifted on the stool. Julie had been working the back of my legs, and I could feel the coolness on my skin.</p> <p>I kept my eyes closed, feeling the warmth of the sun on my skin. I couldn't help glancing back at Julie, as she rubbed sunscreen under my shorts into my back. My swim suit started to tighten against my hard nipples. The feeling of the warmth made me shiver and I opened my eyes. Julie had stopped rubbing up my legs, and was now facing towards me. Her face was only inches away from mine. I felt the heat of her as she looked me over and slowly ran her fingers up the inside of my thigh muscles, under my bathing suit. I didn't know if I was doing itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
