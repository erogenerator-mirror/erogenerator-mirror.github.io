It was a strange way to say thank you for a drink, the way you just offer it. I liked it.</p> <p>“Thank you.” I took the glass from her outstretched hand and took a sip. It was good.</p> <p>I couldn’t hold my head up and look Emily the way she was. I’d looked at many a woman, but this was not one of them. I leaned over and tried to speak.</p> <p>“Emily, you look so great. So very...” I didn’t finish the sentence.</p> <p>She leaned over and rested her head on my shoulder as we talked. Her left arm came around my neck and rested across my chest. “Thank you.”</p> <p>“You are very welcome.” I said as I put my arm around her and pulled her close to me. I took the glass of water from her hand and put it down on her dresser where I had left it. When Emily put her hand on my leg and I could not resist, she started to rub her legs against my shin. “This is nice.” I said as I put my other hand on her shoulder and pulled her against me.</p> <p>We sat in silence for a few minutes and I think she was getting the hang of that. She was really good at it. We talked about work and what we liked and what we liked in movies, sports and music. We had wine and conversation flowed easily. We drank our wine and then sat in each other’s arms drinking. We talked about a lot of things.”</p> <p>“What did you study?” Emily asked as we sat there. She was talking about her history and I, I really hadn’t done that. I had always liked girls, but I never had a chance in life with a woman, no matter how I felt about the subject.</p> <p>“ History,” I said.</p> <p>I smiled and said, “Well, you could say that. Anyway, I did get into anthropology last year, which was really nice. It was interesting to read books about the way history works. I read a lot, but I like a lot of things.”</p> <p>Emily smiled at this.</p> <p>“Oh, you like to read too?” I said as I slid my hand up the inside of her thigh under her thin slacks. She reached down to grab my hand and hold it between her thighs.</p> <p>“I do read a lot,” she smiled.</p> <p>“Well, you are learning. That is interesting.”</p> <p>Emily turned her face to me and looked into my eyes. “What do you think of my work?”</p> <p>“I agree.” I smiled at that and ran my hand along her thigh as I spoke. Her hand pulled my hair to the side leaving a damp spot in front. “That is fascinating. It reminds me of when I was very young. You know where I grew up, right? I loved to travel and explore my own country.”</p> <p>Emily smiled at this.</p> <p>“In fact, I had a cousin I met in school in Germany, he became a sailor. That was very nice. There always seems that way about boys.”</p> <p>“There is such an honor in youth.” I said with a laugh.</p> <p>“Yes, there is. But I like to read, so when the opportunity arises here, I choose to be prepared. I read so much about history and literature that I forget for a while.” She touched my chin with a finger. “It is interesting.”</p> <p>“Well, I think it is.”</p> <p>I raised my eyebrows but she smiled. “What do you think about the fact that a beautiful woman like you, who could take all her clothes off for hours all day long, will probably be doing it for the right reasons, and that is not right?”</p> <p>“I don’t know what you mean.” I replied.</p> <p>Emily smiled and said, “We may be getting to that. So let’s get out of here.” Emily stood up and let me go with her.</p> <p>I followed her to our dorm room door where we kissed passionately, then stepped outside to close the door.
