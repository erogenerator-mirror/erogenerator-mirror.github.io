He whispered again, as his cock, still rock hard, throbbed in his hand. "Fuck her. Fuck her."</p> <p>"Oh, fuck, no, you didn't think it, or wanted to."</p> <p>"I know, I'm such a prude, but I guess I'm being kind of selfish." He laughed at the expression on her face. "I've got to get going. I'll text you when I'm free."</p> <p>"I hate knowing that you're going to fuck her, but if you do, I'll still get off on it. So, you're not going to just throw me in the back and fuck me now, are you?"</p> <p>He shrugged, not really sure if that made her more upset. His cock twitched in his hand again.</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>She smiled, reaching out and gently squeezing his cock through his pants. "I love you too."</p> <p>***</p> <p>"We should be going to the office." he told the people of their conference.</p> <p>"Yeah, but with the other woman." she replied, as a wave of exhaustion washed over her.</p> <p>"Why?" he asked, as he closed his own conference cup in the sink.</p> <p>"I don't want to put my feet on her toes until she gives me a big cum-shot."</p> <p>"Are you sure? I think I have her on the edge of exhaustion."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, just like that."</p> <p>"Good." He stood up, and started taking his clothing off. "You think I'm making her do this now?" he asked, while grabbing his pants.</p> <p>"You can count on it."</p> <p>He smiled to himself. "Damn, you sure are a hunk." He picked her up and threw her onto the desk, and walked around to his desk. He opened up her purse, and took out her bra, panties and her panties, tossing them in his desk drawer.</p> <p>"I have some clothes for you." He told her as he reached into her dresser.</p> <p>"I hope you like them." she joked.</p> <p>"They're great. But it would be a crime to go to work with panties on."</p> <p>He laughed. "I know it would. And I'm not in the mood to work without underwear on anyway."</p> <p>He pulled her dress up over her head, revealing the thin panties that she wore now. She smiled and let him take them off. "I'm all wet." she told him. "I'm sorry. I really should have worn panties."</p> <p>He reached around her and cupped her cheek. "There. That should be all that's needed. Just remember, I'm only going home tomorrow for the weekend. I'll make arrangements for you to come back here, but it has to be before I get in tomorrowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
