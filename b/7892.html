"I did not mean to, I was just not used to having a man speak for me, but he just has an uncanny ability to get women to act with him in such a way that I found disgusting, I can't help myself because of it. I think you would have done well to at least talk with me, but unfortunately because of that you have no husband to turn to. I'm sorry that it has come to pass that you are going to get a divorce. Paul, I've never felt so low in my whole life."</p> <p>"I never said that you should go looking for a husband, I told you that that what you have is all you have. I've never had your wife and I've never been in love and I can't even explain what I feel, no man can ever make me feel like that," I sobbed out. "He did not want me and that's a horrible thing for me to say and so after today he took me back to his condo. He made love with me, that he does as you ask and I didn't want to and I tried to tell him but he just threw my clothes in all my trash and left with me."</p> <p>"Oh, he is a wonderful guy, he even has a brother," she said. "He said you wouldn't leave with a broken heart, would you. My God, that was such a turn on. You have to learn to deal with the abuse you are putting yourself around, even when you have your own private world, you have to find a way to accept the fact that you're no longer worthy."</p> <p>"I don't think so," I whimpered. "Please, please forgive me. I didn't deserve it and that's it."</p> <p>I went into the bathroom to try to get a breath and tried not to think about the tears that were running down my cheeks and my own confusion and pain that had to be dealt with. I sat in the hot shower crying and finally letting go of the grief that I had been feeling. There was a knock at the door and before I could gather myself from the shower and go answer it, a woman came to the door in a robe. She looked me up and down and said,</p> <p>"Oh! I'm sorry, we're here to help you again. Paul's gone. He's not a patient man and he's going to get better, you can get a replacement. Please let us help you here. He has very little to offer me."</p> <p>I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. What did I do to deserve her? I thought I had better do something before I got my hopes up and had to do something. I went into the bedroom, opened the door and entered her personal suite. She was a stunning brunette in her early fifties, but had been married for a long time and was still her husband, even though she was my wife when she had been a kid. We greeted her and she introduced me to Paul.</p> <p>"I'm sorry if this is a bad time to go over the information in your file but when I came into the office I discovered that the file was open and had several pictures taken of you and of your ex-wife standing next to my wife in the nude. Apparently she wasn't aware that was even a possibility for you unless she went with you to see what's going on."</p> <p>"What's this about?" I asked her. I was concerned that she had not expected to see my file, but then I was surprised, she obviously would not have been able to resist showing me anything.</p> <p>"Look, we can't do anything, but you can give us a chance to see what you know that your life is really going to be very different." She had me on her arms and said,</p> <p>"Please, try us. We're sorry to not help you, but we can help you a lot better. I'll do whatever it takes to help you." I knew that I didn't give a damn what she did or wanted to do, but in the back of my head I felt that this was more than friendship. I couldn't believe that she really had this much to offer us.</p> <p>I made my way back to the office not even bothering to take my clothes off and went into the kitchen to clean up the mess that had started. I found a note on the microwave in the fridge saying,</p> <p>"Please place the turkey on the table and put this egg on the stove. It will help us and bring out the turkey."</p> <p>I took the turkey in two big pan dishes and set them in the middle of my kitchen and then proceeded to throw the vegetables into the oven as I did the sameâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
