Finally, his tongue was inside her mouth, his other hand had found the hem of her blouse.</p> <p>"Let's finish," she breathed into his kiss.</p> <p>With that, their clothing vanished, and his hand slipped up the inside of her thigh. His hand reached her moist center and he felt her hand reach down to rub him back again.</p> <p>She pulled his hand down and felt him enter her again. As he moved in her, she could feel her inner walls begin to clench around him.</p> <p>His cock slid easily in and out of her body, until she felt him reach his limit. Without thinking she urged him slowly to her cervix.</p> <p>"I'm close," he told her.</p> <p>She began moving inside him, not wanting him to lose his hardness.</p> <p>"Hold still," she told him as he began to slide out.</p> <p>"No, wait," she told him. "I want...."</p> <p>He paused as he felt her body begin to tense with the waves.</p> <p>"Slow down, John," she told him. "I... want... the... way.... so.... bad.... I never..... would..." His eyes opened as she spoke. She was at the point of no return. His own voice was a strain, "We can't.... go.... again...."</p> <p>"Yes we can," she husked.</p> <p>John's hips began to move as she pressed down into him.</p> <p>"I'll.... hold.... longer...." he cautioned her.</p> <p>She could feel his penis pulsing inside her. She felt him come in her. She felt her juices spill out. After a minute or so she pressed herself into him, and released a few small spongy pulses deep in her belly.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she said as she dropped her head back with a sigh, and leaned back against the wall, a contented sigh.</p> <p>They kissed again a few more minutes, and then she heard him say, "I've been such a good boy. For your first time you're my best."</p> <p>In the hallway, they could not hear the shower running as one of them slipped into his room. The door closed quietly and John was alone with her.</p> <p>"Do you know why you are so flushed?" he asked her gently.</p> <p>She was silent. He wanted to ask. It had never really been important. They both had. She told him, "It's because I had no idea how much of what happened between us would make it any different. I didn't need to look back, and it made me understand. That's just what I thought it was, a man who really wants to know."</p> <p>Her voice was soft again. "I love you," she said.</p> <p>She heard his reply after a long couple seconds, "I love you as much as I loved you. I always have. I even loved you when I was a girl and, when I was going through puberty, some of the girls at my school were very pretty. Your face wasn't very pretty, either, but you certainly had a nice body."</p> <p>She heard his hand come up for a moment, as if to wipe her memory, he turned toward her and said, "I think I've even fallen in love with you. I even love you when you've been lying in my arms."</p> <p>It was all so simple, and yet so powerfully powerful. It was so unexpected. She did everything to ease his nerves he'd never had do something so erotic to him before. She could only take the time to hear him say, "I'm happy to be your lover."</p> <p>He knew something else, too. He could tell her she loved him. He knew he could tell her that he loved her with all his heart. There were two things important to her that day. He would have to know her. He knew it would take time and a bit more patience to know her. He needed to trust her.</p> <p>They embraced one another more tightly, then he kissed her. He kissed her face and began to move down her body, feeling her trembling underneath him.</p> <p>As she began to get more aroused, he began to lick and suck her breasts. He heard her moan a little in an erotic way and he knew she was feeling something else. It surprised him, and his own feelings were very intimate, and it made for a very good afternoon.</p> <p>He felt her body begin to buck against him. As the passion seemed to get to her a little, he moved downward to kiss and suck her bellybutton. He reached the end of her panties. When he saw her body's reaction as her legs went to jelly, he knew she was ready for more.</p> <p>He knew she was turned on. She opened her legs and began rubbing her legs togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
