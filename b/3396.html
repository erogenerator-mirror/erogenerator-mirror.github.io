As she turned away from us and started to walk back to the door, I turned my head and said, "I'm so glad you came. The first thing I've ever heard was that you are a little young, but we can get along just fine without those issues. I really enjoyed talking with you." As she started to walk back toward the door, she leaned over a little in my direction and leaned on my shoulder, her breast pressing into my shoulder as she walked. I leaned back to see if I could get her off the chair. She stopped near to the door. "Did you enjoy talking with me, Eric?"</p> <p>"It was nice to meet a woman as beautiful as you was." I said.</p> <p>"Thanks, I hope so." She said as I gave her a light kiss on the cheek. She handed me back the beer, which I thought was very nice, considering that she looked incredible and was even hotter than I remembered.</p> <p>"Maybe I could be with you later." She smiled at my reaction. I was thinking about where and how she might fit into my plans. A few moments later she broke the awkward silence. "We're going to get out of here and start getting ready. I think your sister will be waiting for you downstairs." She said as she turned, walked out of the bedroom and started walking towards her bedroom door. "Why don't you take your things off, and I'll go grab my purse and we can get going. I'll take the rest of the way here." She finished her statement by saying I'd have a great time tonight as she turned and walked out. I turned and headed for my kitchen, to clean up the mess I had made while we were talking. I had to have a shower before I could go back to bed. I sat there, trying to take in the image of her in her swimsuit. As I was washing my hair, I noticed the door to her room open and in walked her. She was talking to my sister about something and I couldn't help but watch her. She was obviously telling my sister of how the swim meet went and the things she had seen. This was getting the better and I wanted to be the one to take the lead now. I knew I had to do something, but I couldn't think of a single thing that might be appropriate or in line with this new twist of events. As she finished the conversation and left, I went to my room, hoping to clean up and get ready for a night out.</p> <p>"I'm going to grab a shower right now and head downstairs." I said, trying to give her an excuse to walk downstairs.</p> <p>"Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that I'll see you later after I change and then we can take care of business here."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, I understand. I just wanted to say thanks for the swim meet, and for trying to pull me out of here. You're the best and don't take any crap from me for me." I smiled as I was trying to hide the fact that I was still a lot hung over. "You don't know how much I was looking forward to the swim meet."</p> <p>"That's just it. You weren't exactly a virgin, was you just in hopes you would get lucky?"</p> <p>"No, that's not it at all. It's just that it has been quite a long time since I have been out of the pool." I started to get up a pace. She was watching me and I thought she liked to be watched. The feeling of her leg right up against me quickly made my cock begin to twitch. "Well, I think I'm finished in the shower. I just wanted a break for awhile. Do you think you have a key?"</p> <p>"No, I think I'm going to use it. Do you have any beer?"</p> <p>"I'd really appreciate it if you could have a beer before I'm done, please."</p> <p>"Alright, but I think I'll have my own in a minute."</p> <p>"Sure, no problem." I turned and started to go towards the door. She stopped me a little before I reached it. "Wait." She said as she turned her head. "I'll grab you a couple of Bud Lights and a beer. I think we might have enough to go."</p> <p>"I appreciate it." I said as I walked out of the room and towards the kitchen. I opened the refrigerator and saw beer, which I figured would be pretty good. I sat down on the sofa next to her and started to pull off her top. She looked over and then got up. "It's no big deal. It'll help us dry off. Besides, you may be a bit overworked if weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
