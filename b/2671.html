I told her with a wink while I rubbed the bulge in her tight jeans. She was really horny for this man after all she had only known me for a short while and I could tell how much she loved the touch of his tongue after its first couple of inches.</p> <p>"Let's go!" he said reaching across to take my hand. I got up and followed him to the bar, I couldn't help but wonder how many women he wanted tonight.</p> <p>He got me another drink, which I quickly ordered, and we sat and drank for awhile, watching the people who came in from places like clubs or the casino we were staying in.</p> <p>His hand was very gentle, and I loved the way his fingers touched my back as we downed half our drinks. When the last sip, when I wanted more, I leaned over to kiss his lips. He turned me toward him by grabbing my waist with his hands pulling me toward him.</p> <p>His lips were soft, and very wet, as they pressed against mine. He opened his mouth, slipped his tongue into it, before I could even feel it, sliding around each side of my mouth. I was getting really turned on watching his kiss, the kind of kiss I had never given a boyfriend in my life before, and this man was really making me crazy. He pulled me close to him again and pulled back. Slowly, he slid his hand up the back of my dress and started to rub my butt. He pulled me towards him a bit more, and we were kissing again, only this time much longer.</p> <p>He was kissing me in the bar before and knew what to do and did it again, our hands went everywhere except for our mouths.</p> <p>My dress was hiked up around my waist and my hard nipples were rubbing against the rough fabric of this shirt. He unbuttoned the front of the front of my shirt to show me what little he had under there, and he took of the bottom of the bottom half of my dress shirt to get a better glimpse. I was sitting here in a bar while I was having a man's way with my best friend tonight, and I loved it.</p> <p>His hand was sliding up and down my breast as he kissed me then took my hand and slid it under his baggy jeans to rub his hard cock through his jeans.</p> <p>"You don't have to do this, I've seen plenty of women tonight, and I think it's time you did something with your friend." He moaned as he whispered into my ear.</p> <p>"I want to, I just want to make his day special, like I used to, like I always do," I answered as I pressed my crotch against his.</p> <p>He unzipped his pants, reached into his fly and pulled out his rock hard cock. He held it in both hands, looked at me and told me to look back into the bar and watch what he was doing.</p> <p>I watched as he pulled down his shorts as he started to jack his meat. His cock was long and was getting bigger with his excitement, as it got bigger and bigger as he stroked himself. He took a step out of the pants with one hand as the other hand slid up my thigh. I could feel the soft skin on his hand rub my wet pussy as I took in the sight.</p> <p>"Can you feel it hardening?" He said as his hand touched my crotch a bit faster.</p> <p>"I can," he grunted as his eyes were glued to my tits as my nipples stiffened even more. He put his hand back down my skirt and felt my wetness again through my panties, it was already a lot wetter than the first time he pulled his fingers out.</p> <p>"Look at me!"</p> <p>I nodded and watched as he kept stroking himself and rubbing his cock faster then pulling his big fingers out and then rubbing his balls, he kept rubbing in such a hurry. I took a bit of his drink and sat it on the bar and opened it, leaned over my seat and pulled my panties off and put it to my face, I watched him get off the bar and walk down the hallway. He walked right to me, grabbed my arm just before he pulled me to my feet and turned me around just before he bent me over my chair, spreading my cheeks and fingering there while he fucked my pussy hard, all I could do was hold on for dear life as he pounded me hard.</p> <p>He looked right at me as he continued to stroke himself, he just kept stroking his hard cock in front of my face so I couldn't take it. I wanted to suck his dick in the bar again so I could taste him again while he was like this in real life.</p> <p>Finally, his cock erupted in my mouth, it tasted salty, like he had just cum in my mouth, all the while I was thinking I was going toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
