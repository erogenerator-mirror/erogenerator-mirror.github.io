We'll figure out soon enough."</p> <p>He sat back down.</p> <p>"So what do you think about the tattoo?" he said, looking back to me.</p> <p>"I think it looks pretty good, but what about the collar?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, it's all just part of the outfit," he answered.</p> <p>I was feeling a tinge of anger at him and I felt a sudden chill. He saw me and smiled.</p> <p>"Oh yes! I didn't quite do something. I'm glad you enjoyed this!"</p> <p>Again, I felt anger and sadness as he made himself comfortable on the bed and then quickly climbed. His mouth moved to mine and as our tongues danced together he said, "Please don't laugh." Then he quickly kissed my mouth and began to caress my body. My arousal came quickly back as his hand slipped between my thighs and felt my hot, wet flesh.</p> <p>"Oh God," I moaned, as he explored my center. "I need to cum!" I pushed his body off of the bed.</p> <p>"Be patient," he warned. "I will take care of that."</p> <p>I rolled over onto my belly and pushed out my bottom.</p> <p>"Not just yet," he said.</p> <p>He pushed up the skirt of my dress and slid it down to my hips. When it was over my head I turned and presented my pussy to him. He looked at it for a minute, then ran his fingers up the slit of my sex. I looked over my shoulder and laughed again.</p> <p>"What the hell am I going to wear?"</p> <p>He grinned and said, "I can't remember the last time we went out like this."</p> <p>I laughed and he slipped a strap on dildo between my parted legs and began to rub it along my slit. As my sex opened it felt amazing. He pulled back and then pressed a button, a panel slid on and I felt the dildo being pushed into me. A groan came from my mouth. He started to move the cock inside me, but stopped when he felt my muscles tighten around him. I heard this groan of despair and looked over my shoulder.</p> <p>"Oh, God! Please don't do this!"</p> <p>"It's not too much, you need to stretch out. After what we just did, I don't think I'll be able to take it all."</p> <p>He kept the dildo buried inside me, rubbing my insides with it, making me gasp as an orgasm built. I moaned.</p> <p>"Please, please stop. Don't make it stop!"</p> <p>He kept rubbing his cock against my insides and I felt like my insides wanted him to stop. Once again he started to move his cock inside me, and felt my muscles loosen as his hips moved faster than intended. My body felt as if it was on fire, and a wave of bliss went through me when his hand took my clit between his thumb and the fingers of his other hand. I couldn't resist the pleasure this produced.</p> <p>"Oh please," I cried, pushing back against his hand.</p> <p>"Please. You have to cum!" he groaned. "I can't take any more of this!"</p> <p>"NO!" I cried out as all of my muscles contracted against his cock. "Fuck me!" I cried out again as he stopped.</p> <p>He looked at me, a smile coming to his face and he moved his hips to slide his cock up my slit.</p> <p>"Fuck!" I thought as his tip slid up the length of me and finally entered me. "Fuck," I thought as his hips pulled back out and then slid smoothly back up into me. I pulled my hands to his hips and grabbed his ass as he slowly impaled me on his cock. His hands came down to my hips and his thumb pressed deep inside me as he pulled almost all the way out of me.</p> <p>"Fuuuck!" I moaned as the feeling of my orgasm suddenly took over my body. I gasped and moaned louder when I felt him slide back from me. He was holding onto me as I rolled onto my back. His shaft seemed to be longer than when it had been inside me and seemed thicker even though no inch had entered me. He slid from the bed and then up my leg. I spread my legs wider and he slid his tongue inside me again. Both of us moaned as we tasted both of us as he licked me faster. A hand grabbed my hair and held it up while our bodies moved faster as the orgasm built up inside of both of us.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" I cried out as the orgasm ripped through me and then exploded up myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
