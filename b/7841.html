Yes, I think we've been neglecting the party."</p> <p>I thought for a moment about if it could possibly have been. Sure enough, the girl with the big tits dropped her eyes to the screen behind the bar. And what a surprise it was?</p> <p>"We've got to do some new stuff..." she started.</p> <p>"And a good reason for the party!" she finished.</p> <p>Mick was the new co-host and a good guy. He was just a little over a year younger than me. He was cute at 6'3 and very fit. He had a little extra weight that helped him keep his body in great shape. He was very fit and fit, not fat looking like a lot of the men in the city would have. The guys on the beach could say he was all muscle. The people at the party could call him some type of bimbo or a loser.</p> <p>"No, it's too much. No, no. You can't go drinking and fucking around with him. Let him get away. I'm just helping out."</p> <p>"Hah! I knew the only reason you were letting him go was to help his ego. I know you can do it. All those guys on the beach have got to keep their egos alive."</p> <p>Mick had an evil little smile on his face and looked me straight in the eye.</p> <p>"I said no. We're not spending a night in Vegas. Let him get away."</p> <p>The girl with the big tits was a little less excited, but her eyes said she was looking forward. The girl sitting across from us had her head on her knees and elbows crossed behind her. For some reason those two faces, when I saw them I almost came in my trunks. The girl's mouth hung open and her eyes showed a combination of fear and shock. I'm sure she thought I was going to jump in bed with her and start fucking her silly. That's only one of what the girl on the screen was thinking. She really was trying to get us to go to bed.</p> <p>"This is really hard to get your attention. I didn't know you were here."</p> <p>"It's my job to keep your mind off booze," the girl answered.</p> <p>I thought about offering her something, but I guess it seemed like the right thing to say. The girls in my life were not that different from each other. The last time I saw them was just a few months ago. I wasn't really looking forward to the night, but the girls were definitely in the mood. They had already had a couple drinks already, so I didn't really mind. I could tell that we would not get back to this room if we had been here earlier. The two of them were already making out on her couch, so I figured that I might as well just sit there until it all went away. They knew that we would be staying on the beach for the next couple of weeks. They were so beautiful and sensual. It was going to be the sexiest 3 weeks in a row.</p> <p>Mick was still leaning against the bar enjoying himself. The girl sat back in her chair and looked up at him. The girls on the screen in front of them were not only making out, they were actually going at it! And, my cock was about to come back to life. I thought to myself, what's the harm in a little action. I didn't care if she was going to try to get me to leave, I just went and tried to put it in my mind. So I sat back and watched.</p> <p>The first few minutes of the movie was great. The girl on the screen was doing a little dancing. The girl looked over a shoulder and looked back. They were kissing. The girl in front of them had a hand up under the girl's tank top. The other hand continued to play with her breast. As the girl was pulling her shirt out of her skirt, a couple more minutes of the show continued with her pulling me out of the chair. I had forgotten about everyone in the room. I couldn't take my eyes off of the girls in front of me. I could feel my cock getting harder by the second.</p> <p>I could actually hear the girl on the screen moaning with pleasure. I think the girl in front of the girl with the big boobs was enjoying it. I was in heaven all over again. I wanted to take the girls by the hand and drive her to another orgasm. My cock had already started coming out of its restraint.</p> <p>There was a break on the second act. The girl on the screen was leaning back in her couch making a show of it. She was doing the typical pose; getting a little sun tan on the back of her neck and arms, her eyes shut, and a wide smile onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
