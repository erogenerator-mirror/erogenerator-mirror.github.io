Besides, it's a pity she has to keep us down here. She'll be in the audience in a minute," I say as I take a breath and walk over to the sound system. As I reach the speakers I realize that if she doesn't hurry up and start the music, I have no problem leaving the room.</p> <p>Steve watches my every move and sighs as I turn and walk slowly back over to him. It's almost like being on stage, and it is more beautiful and intense than I can say with my hands. I reach out and grab his hand and put it on his thigh at the back of the chair.</p> <p>"Feel comfortable? You're not the only one. How about a little dance?" He looks around the room before he lifts his eyes to me and smiles.</p> <p>I feel a warm smile spread across my face as he stares into my eyes. Slowly I put my arms around my husband and run my hands down to his waist. I unbutton his pants and slide them off of him, sliding my hands up his legs to cup his erection through his briefs. I'm glad that I wore no underwear at all. I'm happy to have him to play with, and maybe some other time. I don't even mind that I'm not in control, that I'm playing his wife for the very first time.</p> <p>He steps into me and starts dancing against me. It feels wonderful, and he's not pushing me away because I'm moving my body against his. I can feel how excited he gets, but I can't really bring myself to actually touch him. I'm hoping that he'll start getting turned on, and get hard. As he starts working on the beat, I get lost in his scent and feel the heat from his body on mine. It's different being turned on by him than by just being alone in a room.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I know how to dance this," he murmurs to me, "but it looks like I do." The music begins and he starts to move it in slow motion. I feel my own arousal as he moves his hips back and forth, my hands running all over his body. His breathing becomes more labored as he moves his hands across my breasts, his hips rubbing against me. I feel myself heating up as I feel the effects his dancing has on us and it's making me as excited as I've ever known. He kisses me softly again, and presses himself against me.</p> <p>"I don't think I'll be able to do this tomorrow," he whispers against my cheek as our tongues touch.</p> <p>"You have to," I say as I press my lips lightly against his ear, "it's too early."</p> <p>I hold him close, then I push his hands away and he falls onto the couch on his back. I start to unbuckle his belt and unzip him. I watch his eyes roll back and I feel a soft moan come from his chest. I want to take that moan to my lips and suck that sound out of him, and do it again.</p> <p>I drop to the floor between his legs and start to undo his pants. My mind is reeling at the prospect of this incredible man wanting me. I never wanted to do it at all. For a fleeting moment I have wondered if I had wanted to at all, but now it seems as if I had just found a treasure that I wouldn't have considered. That thought didn't go away until I was on my knees in front of him. His eyes are still closed, and he's not moving. I smile in spite of myself, running my hands lightly across his cock as I lower my head down to my husband's legs.</p> <p>I start by tracing the line of his skin with my tongue. I run my nails all along his thighs, teasing, and just as I'm about to push my mouth onto him, he starts to move against me, pressing himself farther into the couch. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, or if I'm just making him want me even more. It seems like he's trying to force himself against me. I don't care. It feels so damn good. I just want some of that, so I just keep going. He's moaning now, my mouth moving up and down his wet cock as I take him in. I push my tongue deeper into him as he moans loudly and then he puts his hands on my head, holding me there still as he starts to shudder, my mouth never letting up on him with my mouth. I don't want to interrupt him because there is so much more to do. I need to finish him off, and suck on him, but I don't pull away. Instead I run my tongue along the head of his cock, tasting the saltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
