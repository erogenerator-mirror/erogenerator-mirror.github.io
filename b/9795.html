Just don't let it happen," she said as I pulled gently on her nipples while she squeezed her breasts tightly again. I was just about to pull my shorts down when we heard the front door open.</p> <p>There was our parents; we were about to leave when, at the top of the stairs, I heard a voice call my name. I quickly pulled down my shorts to cover myself.</p> <p>"Who is it?" I said, thinking I needed to get out of there as fast as possible.</p> <p>"Mom, it's me," she replied, still pulling on her nipples.</p> <p>"Is she with you?"</p> <p>"Yes, she's with me. They stopped by this weekend and they're here," she said in a way that made me feel like I had no choice but to do the right thing, "Why? What happened? What have I done?"</p> <p>"Mom, I love you but I can't be alone. I tried and tried again, but I didn't get what you gave me and I am still worried about you," I said, trying to make sure I was on the same page as her and didn't give a shit what happened with Julie.</p> <p>"Okay, honey, if it seems that way to you. Let's not be angry at each other. What happened? If it seems that way to you, I'm going to leave," she said, still squeezing her nipples tight. I heard the door close behind them and then a few minutes later, Julie walked out and into the kitchen.</p> <p>My heart started beating wildly, "Where have you been? You can't leave me alone like that! I'm so sorry honey, I couldn't help but lose myself, please forgive me," she said trying to make it seem like a reasonable thing to say, "I really want us to find a way to fix it."</p> <p>"Sure," I said.</p> <p>"I just want you to know you're still safe from me and I'm not angry; so don't argue with me tonight. I'm still trying to recover from the shock of having found your mom again," she said, trying to make it sound like a comforting talk.</p> <p>"Okay, but remember one thing, I'm a woman now, not just your mom, you are still my son, now I am your father," she said, almost begging me to forgive her.</p> <p>"Thanks, mom, but I'll be back,"</p> <p>"Alright, just remember I need you to be happy," she replied, giving me a hug and kissing me hard.</p> <p>"I'll take over at the same time if you need me," were my words to her before I left. She was one sexy lady and I am still very horny, I'd hate to think what my future wife would have to put up with if I left her.</p> <p>I got home and couldn't wait to see if Julie was still at the door. I hurried the house, threw on some clothes, then headed down stairs while I thought about what to buy. I was sure there were other things I could buy as well.</p> <p>WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON</p> <p>The next two days were uneventful in my life without my mom, or of hearing the news of her breakup. But one thing I did notice was that Julie had moved her stuff out of her parent's house and had gone shopping. She was still living with her grandparents, but we were doing everything to get their property and be near her while she was staying with her grandparents. Julie had been gone for almost two weeks now and I was relieved to be able to get the car and her apartment keys and take her in for a week. We had never been to see her family before, so I figured the best she could do was move all of her stuff into their house. The week was long and tiring and one thing I wanted to do was spend time with Julie.</p> <p>I got home around midnight and found Julie sleeping on the sofa; she was still in bed, so I decided to use her bed and go get something to eat. I wanted to see if any of her old stuff might be left at her grandmother's place. When I returned, she was still in bed holding on to her pillows; she looked amazing.</p> <p>"I'm glad you could come honey," she said as she pulled the pillow close to her chest, "I really was hoping you'd be home. I'm glad you stayed, I really love hearing about you," she said, looking up at me and smiling her bright smile.</p> <p>"I'll see what I can do, I've been in the Army for a year. That was a good long time, I've been looking forward to meeting my friends and catching up," I said, trying to actâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
