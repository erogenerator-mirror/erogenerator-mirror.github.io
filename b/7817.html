Looking her in the eye I continued kissing her. Her lips parted and we kissed passionately. My tongue gently probed her lips and into her mouth where I teased her teeth. We kissed for several minutes. When I pulled back I looked down at her. She was sitting up straight giving me the impression that she didn't want to stop. I continued holding her chin in my hand and kept my lips pressed firmly against her mouth. Her tongue was wet and begging to be licked.</p> <p>She said, "I don't want you to stop"</p> <p>"I don't want you to stop. I want you, to stay with me forever."</p> <p>"Will you do that for me?"</p> <p>"Of course." I lowered the zipper on her skirt. Her skirt fell to around her knees, there was a little dark area visible where her panties lay. I slowly peeled her panties from her. She raised her hips and pushed her ass to me to get more access.</p> <p>Pulling my head up she told me she didn't want me to make her cum like that.</p> <p>"I know you like me like that."</p> <p>"It's different."</p> <p>"Do you want to go back to sleep with me?"</p> <p>"I think so."</p> <p>"Do you want to go back to sleep with me?"</p> <p>"Yes. And yes, I do!"</p> <p>I kissed the tip of her nose and got off the bed. When I turned to go back in the room to get my clothes I caught a glimpse of two pairs of panties hanging from her legs. She gave me a puzzled look, I pointed in the direction of my clothes and said, "I'll go get some shorts for you."</p> <p>I left the bedroom and returned with my shorts. She got on her knees and removed them in two smooth loops of cloth which she stuffed in the middle of her chest. I sat on the edge of the bed and she lay back on the bed while I stepped into my shorts. I pulled the shorts down on one leg and she was naked from the waist down. I lay on my side next to her and she put her arm around my neck and kissed me gently on the lips.</p> <p>"That's it lover, feel free to go to sleep with me, I need you."</p> <p>When I got into bed with her and rolled on my side she laid her hands on my chest and kissed me. As our bodies merged we could feel the desire of one another's bodies that we had only acknowledged in the past.</p> <p>I broke the kiss and she said, "I think that was the most passionate kiss of my life!"</p> <p>I replied, "I never felt like that before. Thank you for the great time we have together. I felt so at peace with myself after we made love."</p> <p>She kissed me with a hunger I'd never experienced before. I reached my arm under her and found a nipple which started to harden as it pressed against my palm. I rolled it between my fingers and moved my hands down across her stomach to her neatly trimmed pussy. I could feel her lips becoming wet and my fingers explored her folds. She gasped when I touched her clit but then moaned when I massaged it with my fingers. I used my finger to caress her as I moved a second finger into her.</p> <p>She broke our kiss long enough to say, "I've never felt like I was before!" She pushed her hips under me and thrust her pussy up into my fingers which caused them to slide deeper inside of her and I pushed them further into her.</p> <p>I said, "If you don't want to move I would love to. In fact I'd love to eat you out until you were so tired you almost passed out."</p> <p>"I never wanted you to eat me, but it was so sensual and it felt so good."</p> <p>I continued to run my fingers over her clit and her hips were thrusting up and down in a rhythm that made her shiver. I took both hands and cupped her breasts and rolled her nipples between my thumb and finger while running my fingers gently over her lips which started to moisten.</p> <p>Her nipples hardened and I lowered my mouth and sucked her left nipple in. Then with my tongue I began to slowly caress her, taking time before moving back to her. As my mouth traveled over her, the pressure of my lips and tongue kept her nipples hard and she pushed herself up into my face. She continued to make encouraging noises and my lips and my fingers continued to caress her swollen clit. When I took the nipple between my lips and felt herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
