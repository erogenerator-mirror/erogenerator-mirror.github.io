"Can I stay here tonight?"</p> <p>"Sure," I replied, kissing her as I held her close. "I don't want to be gone to bed too late."</p> <p>I gave her a moment to think before I spoke again and said, "I'm not trying to be your traveling companion."</p> <p>"No. You just have to agree on the whole thing and then you can leave," she said, pulling me closer to her and kissing me again. "Let's be on our own then shall we?"</p> <p>"Definitely," I replied.</p> <p>****</p> <p>We made our way down to the pool and lounged in one of the cushioned lounges until the sun went down and the lights dimmed to the 'sickest spot of the day.' It was still dark outside and it felt warm and inviting in my hand as we lay together on the chaise lounge. I kissed and fondled her gently as she caressed my face and neck and began to run her fingers over my body. When she finally touched my cock, it stiffened in her hand quickly and she slid it up and down along her slit, making herself wetter and wetter as she moved it down over her clit. She took my fingers out of her mouth and began to suck on them as she stroked me and I raised my hips up off the lounger for her to take over and continue stroking me as her mouth made love to my cock. She took her hands off me briefly to run her hands over my chest and down to my balls.</p> <p>She knelt up above me on her knees, my cock nestled between her legs, and slowly began to rub it down over her slit for a minute or so before lowering herself onto me. I took hold of her hips and began to move up into her as she moved back down onto me, my cock sliding easily inside my friend until it disappeared up into her. I kissed her lightly as I began to move, pulling out and pushing back as she began to move on me very slowly and I soon felt her wetness caressing my cock as it slid in and out of her. I held my mouth over her as I slowly moved her about. I kissed her passionately as I continued to rub the head of my cock up and down over her clit, pushing deep into her until she lifted her body up so the head of my cock popped out of her to slide back over her clit to slide fully back over it. The whole time I just moved against her as she moved her hips back and forth as she pushed back against me. I could feel her body tense as she pressed herself down onto me as her body tensed. I pulled her harder down onto me, my cock slipping completely up into her as her own body tensed and she pulled her lips off my cock to gasp at the same time. She held me tightly as she rode me and her entire body shook and quaked as her orgasm ripped through her and I kissed her hard, letting her feel how good I had made her feel and how she had made her feel with her words and what we had done. I slid my hands underneath her bottom and lifted her up until our chests were touching and she began to move up and down on me, making sure my cock slid deep inside her, making me groan as she moved her body up and down. I held onto each back of her as she moved up and down on me, allowing my hands to squeeze her beautiful ass as she moved her body faster and faster as I did. The feeling was so amazing to me as my hands slid up and down her tight skin, but it didn't take long for me to begin to swell in her tight warm pussy and she began to move her body more quickly as she fucked me. I could feel my balls tightening and, without warning, the first volley of cum sent up into her and she pressed herself down hard on me and she jerked hard down onto me as she continued to bounce up and down on my hard cock. Finally spent and out of breath, she fell forward against me as we kissed hard and passionately.</p> <p>She fell off me and lay next to me on the towel, panting heavily. We held each other as we recovered from our intense lovemaking and kissed and held each other for what seemed like hours. It was the first time either of us had had so much passion and tenderness in such a short amount of time. We didn't touch each other, but kissed and held as we kissed each other. Finally, I could tell that she had to get back to sleep and she rose up and walked slowly to a bathroom to dress and change into the morning clothes as she held the doorknocker together for me to get. When she came back in to the chaise lounge, she stood next to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
