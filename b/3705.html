"So...have you ever had a boy?"</p> <p>"Not one of mine." He sounded flattered at me as he took a quick breath to settle back in his chair.</p> <p>Then we were moving towards the next thing, the game. I felt my heart racing in anticipation, my breathing becoming heavier. My eyes were glancing over to the boy around the desk, still talking with his co-worker and not looking at me. I felt my hands slide slowly up my thighs, just enough to feel the heat of his eyes.</p> <p>"Are you done?" I said, sitting down in his lap. My heart was racing as he pulled me towards him, his hands on my face, guiding my mouth to his, and kiss me. "Good boy. You made that boy proud." I leaned in again, wanting to kiss him more, wanting to make him feel what it is like for a boy. But instead, I had to pull back, staring at the boy's face. "You can't blame a boy for wanting attention," my friend said.</p> <p>"Yeah but that's how he's been looking at me all these years," I chuckled. "Is it true?" I moved closer to the teacher, pulling on his tie.</p> <p>"Oh, he always says he'll always be able to show me whatever I want," he said. "Well I'll be that boy. I'll be the boy that you can feel for like you see how it's always been." I pulled the top of his slacks down, exposing his hard cock, the head of it a slightly darker shade of red than his skin. I leaned in, kissing him, sucking him gently into my mouth. He sighed, leaning up towards me, my hands running all over his body.</p> <p>But this wasn't the same boy that I saw earlier. This was a boy I knew. My hand slid up his shirt, feeling the hair there, not a hair on him. I slid my fingers under his shirt, feeling how soft it was. I smiled to myself as I ran the tip of my finger up one side, down the other, tracing circles around the sensitive tip of his cock, making his breathing deepen.</p> <p>I put my lips to the side of his ear, nibbled on the lobe, sending shivers of pleasure through his body. He leaned in, pressing his lips to me, kissing me. I pulled away from him, turning to the boy.</p> <p>"No," I said, "I want to tease him today. But this time, it's your turn." The boy turned back to the papers, giving me my instructions on his next move.</p> <p>"What are you going to do?" I asked, taking his hand. I took the hand of my friend in mine, pressing his hands against my breasts, his hips shifting on the couch as he leaned forward. He slipped his arms under mine, taking me in his arms, sliding down to his knees, taking off my skirt. He pulled me around to the edge of the couch, making me lie back and then lay down, parting my legs and pulling my pussy lips apart with his fingers. I watched in awe as he dipped his tongue deep into me, making me shiver.</p> <p>"Oh...yes," I moaned as his tongue found my clit, making me feel that wonderful feeling again. He pulled my hair back, biting my ear as he licked my clit, making me almost climax immediately, until he found the spot that made me scream out as my body shook with pleasure. I had to pull my hands out of his control as I came, moaning my name, looking into his eyes as I squirted onto his face.</p> <p>"How many times have you tasted yourself?" He said, pulling out his finger.</p> <p>"How many?" He laughed, pulling my hair and kissing me once more as I sucked on his finger. He pulled me upwards again, pushing me to my knees on the couch.</p> <p>"How many times have you cum?" He pushed me back, lying down on my back, looking at the ceiling while I sucked on his hard cock. I looked up at his face just as he shot off all over my face. I watched his face then looked down in a haze of ecstasy to see his body shivering, a smile on his face as he closed his eyes. He pulled me with him to my feet, making me sit down on the couch as the boy stood up, still looking at me. I smiled, running my hands over his strong black body as my eyes followed his hips. I kissed him, kissing his skin, tasting his skin, making him shudder again, making me smile again as my hands ran through his hair, running over his throat, up his jaw and across his chin. I loved making him feel specialâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
