I was scared to go and do this; it would end up with a fight that she would lose before long. But she was serious; her goal was to win me back, by convincing me to do something she was sure would get me hurt. We kissed passionately and she pulled herself against me. She moved her leg a bit until there was no space between us. She put her arm around my waist and moved her other hand down to rub my still covered cock as we continued to kiss.</p> <p>We made it to her place within a few minutes, and I made the first move. I pulled her to me and hugged her as much as I could. I wanted this to last forever, but we were just kissing. It was a different kind of embrace; one she never wanted to end. We moved in unison, our bodies moving, not trying to fit.</p> <p>When I slid my hand down to her ass, she didn't seem to mind. After a few seconds she got to her feet and took my face in her hands, then kissed me with a passion, letting her tongue slip into my mouth. We hugged tightly. She pulled her knees up and pressed her hips into mine. I could feel how wet her pussy was.</p> <p>I felt her lips part; I looked over at the clock. It was already past 3, when we had finished. I felt like my whole world had just vanished. It was a dream come true; this whole day had been a dream that we never would wake up from, we would be like a couple in a room, a couple that we did not really need to get to. We were in a way a perfect thing to live forever. A dream come trueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
