I sat down, leaning back on my chair, watching, watching as the two of them made love. I was still very aware of my own pussy, but it was too sensitive, to move. My pussy did not tingle, it just felt raw and unyielding as I watched.</p> <p>The woman looked right at me, I can't actually tell which of them turned her on more – her partner – or the woman. "Are you hard Dave? I know you must be." she finally spoke back to him.</p> <p>Dave smiled back at her, knowing exactly what was going on. He had not been a virgin in ages, and he must have been proud of fucking, so the way she had spoken made this encounter almost sexual in nature.</p> <p>She looked me directly in the eye, and asked, "Can you fuck me now?"</p> <p>My eyes widened. "How? I've never had a chance."</p> <p>"Are you?" she replied. "It's not an option, you have to get home."</p> <p>"No, I mean yes," he replied.</p> <p>"Then you have to get home, fuck my wife and bring your own ass off."</p> <p>"I've got to fuck you like I promised" he said. I stood up, my legs wobbly, I had a lot on my mind. This wasn't what I was expecting, but at the same time I was looking forward to it. I put my dress on, took off my bra and panties, then knelt down on my hands and knees on the floor near the door. The woman looked at me, then over at my husband, he smiled, raised his eyes to meet mine for a moment, and nodded. I looked back, and I was naked, on my hands and knees, naked. I could have screamed at them to get on with it, but I don't think either of them noticed.</p> <p>"So, do it right here," the woman said softly, as if I had not spoken, "do it right here in my presence."</p> <p>I turned to face her, my hands raised in the air as I lowered my head. My legs slightly parted, her eyes looked at me from above the door.</p> <p>"What the hell is going on here?" she said finally.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I can't talk, but I can say the word," he said. "Now go home."</p> <p>"Yes Dave. I'll do it." She took his hand, looked him straight in the eye, and smiled.</p> <p>The woman stood up, her heels clicking on the marble floor. "Now, I want you to come home, and satisfy me."</p> <p>Dave walked back to the door, and I stood to him, still naked, my feet still half-way down the corridor. He hesitated, then looked at me. "Are you sure you can do this?" I shrugged and smiled. "Yes."</p> <p>I closed my eyes and reached for the door. "Go" I whispered, and Dave stopped walking and turned around to face me. We stood in the doorway and I could still feel my pussy tingling and my pussy still wanting him. "Come" I whispered again, and Dave took me by the hand and led me naked to his bedroom. As we passed the door, he turned and grabbed my arm and turned me on to the bed, bending me over the edge, my hands bracing my weight against the bed. I felt his hands on my arse, his fingers teasing my pussy, stroking my lips, spreading them open.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, Dave!" I screamed at him, as he drove his cock home one time. I screamed, so loud. He fucked me for what seemed like an eternity. I could feel the heat from his cock as it entered me. This was no way for a virgin to be fucked.</p> <p>He pulled out almost all the way, then ramrod into me, slamming me against the bed, driving his cock fully into me. I gasped, "Yes! Yes! Oh yessss!"</p> <p>He continued to drive his cock into me. I could feel the warmth of his cock as it battered into my cervix – the sensations were different. I had fantasized about being taken by him, I had been scared, but it felt so good. The feelings of his cock deep inside of me were different, and it drove me wild. "Yes!" I cried, "Do me!"</p> <p>He slowed, pulling almost all the way out, then slowly pulling it back. As he did this, he held his cock in its place, held it in me. He said, "Are you sure? I've never done that before. I've never fucked a virgin before."</p> <p>I shook—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
