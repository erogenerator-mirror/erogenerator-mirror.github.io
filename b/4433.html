She pulled out a glass for me to drink.</p> <p>It occurred to me that since Sarah had told me about her past sexual relationships that I would be the first person to learn of the sexual history of her. I sat and wondered if she knew what she was about to learn? Sarah came back with a glass full of a pale yellow beverage, and handed it to me while she sat back down in a reclining chair.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" She asked.</p> <p>"It's very sweet,"</p> <p>I smiled at her. "I have tried to tell you many times how I felt when I first met you, but every time I remember I can't find the one to tell you what I feel for you."</p> <p>"I want to thank you for not asking me first and for letting me see it." She said smiling at me. "I had just told you about my first lesbian sexual experience last week, and I also learned that you also have had some lesbian experiences as well."</p> <p>I laughed, "You have been there a while? And what about your first lesbian lesbian experience? The one I just shared with you?"</p> <p>"It was fun and I didn't mind sharing it with you as I have shared many of my experiences with others. I told you before, I had been with men and women while you were my boyfriend, and I enjoyed being with men and women together and having their hands on my body as though I was some kind of pet." Sarah said as she ran her hand down my cheek and then pulled me into her arms. I put the wine to her lips and she slowly opened her mouth. I put a hand to the back of her head and brought her mouth to mine. We stayed lip locked for a moment and then slowly began to explore each other's mouths with our tongues. My hand slowly moved down her body, down her neck, to her cleavage, which was lightly covered in a thin fabric of what I hoped was an old fashioned bra. I could feel the warmth of her skin and that of her tits; the bra itself was too small for my 6'3" frame, and I felt the soft texture of her nipples.</p> <p>I broke the kiss and pushed her down on to her back and knelt, "Your nipples would show if you were naked," I whispered. "It's not like we have the privacy of those old barns at home."</p> <p>When Sarah grabbed my head and pulled my face closer to her nipples I immediately started to suck on a bit of the fabric I had on her skin. I had not intended to touch her tits before, but I couldn't help myself and sucked on them for a while, first them, then caressed them with my tongue. Sarah made little moaning noises of pleasure.</p> <p>As I sucked on a bit of the bra for a minute or two a moment then stood up, "Let me take it off, honey, so you can feel the other on your body better if you are going to show us a new part of yourself," I said.</p> <p>Sarah didn't answer; instead she just closed her mouth and said, "Oh, that feels good. I want you to suck on each one so I can feel you sucking them while I try on yours."</p> <p>"Okay babe," I said and knelt down between her legs.</p> <p>"I was just saying, since we're going to be having some sex, you should have a lot of foreplay along with that," I warned.</p> <p>I moved between Sarah's legs and slowly licked and kissed the insides of her thighs. Sarah had shaved her pussy completely bare, but had not bothered with a wax trim. She was already very clean looking when I had first seen her; except for a few hairs around the opening to her vagina. If I hadn't just sucked on her tits I would have been able to tell from how wet she was.</p> <p>I had noticed her earlier and I figured that she would be in the same state as myself. I wanted to get my cock inside of her before we even had sex, so I quickly turned around and began to rub my cock along her wet slit. Sarah was squirming and making squealing sounds as I rubbed her clit with my fingers. I got the tip of my cock just inside of her and began to press back against her. Once again she squealed as a new sensation came over me, but this time I could tell from the look of bliss on her face as she pressed against me and her pelvis started to roll against my hand.</p> <p>I got on my feet and then lay down between Sarah's legs as she pulled on her knees so I could kiss the inside of her knee. At the same time I kissed the inside of her thigh and then began to lick the inside of her leg.
