I said as I reached down and pulled the door open. The room was completely empty except for the sound of the door being unlocked.</p> <p>I walked slowly to the door where a small, dark, white dresser stood. The door opened on the side and I turned and walked back to her looking over her shoulder at me.</p> <p>"Come on in baby." I said as I took the dresser and turned it so it faced the door. I put my hand on the small of her back and pulled her into the room.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed as we stood close to each other. I put my hand on her cheek and bent down to kiss her. She was soft and warm and I slid my hands up to cup her breast. She moaned and pushed her butt up to meet my crotch as I pulled away. I had the whole dresser round the whole side of the room and now she was standing in front of me, her eyes looking up at me. I stepped closer and wrapped her up and kissed her hungrily. I broke the kiss and she put her hands on my chest as we both watched her as our tongues danced together. She pulled at the tie of her top and slowly undid it. I pushed it from her shoulders and it fell to the ground.</p> <p>She pushed it further down her arms and let it drop to the floor but left her hands to hang there on the top of the dresser for a second. I could see the bottom of her breast and the smoothness of her skin, the top hem of her skirt falling all around her waist.</p> <p>Her eyes widened as she stared at me, almost seeming to say 'I'm going to come right here'.</p> <p>I put two fingers under her chin and tilted her head up to look at me. The corner of her jaw dropped as the tip of her lips made a little 'o' as she did so. She looked me right through to my eyes as our mouths met in another passionate kiss. My hands slid down her back and gripped her ass cheeks, pulling her tight against me.</p> <p>My mouth slipped lower and her tongue slipped inside to dance with mine. I could feel her breasts press against my chest and I knew by her nipple that she was holding something back. I began to kiss her again, tasting her lips and tongue, running my hand further down her back to cup the mound of her ass. Her hands squeezed my own tight and I could feel the wetness beginning to dribble down her thighâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
