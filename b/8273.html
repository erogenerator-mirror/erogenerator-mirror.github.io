And it hit him hard. The power was there, as well as in some basic, mystical way. It was not just a matter of being inside, it was in the very core of her being to hold him with. It was all there and then.</p> <p>"Perhaps some way to get the power back would be better?" she continued.</p> <p>"No," he said, "there could be more magic in it."</p> <p>"There certainly is, as is the magic in my body," she said seriously with a smile.</p> <p>"I think there is," he said without thinking, he was so excited.</p> <p>"Well, now we are even," she responded with a smirk. "We don't have to do this at the ceremony. At least not in front of everyone," she said while reaching for a light on the table. The glow was the brightest on the table and a bright red candle illuminated from the candles around the table.</p> <p>It took a little while for them to get to the ceremony, and the ceremony itself was a short while. But once there, they were all naked, and very quickly got into the ceremonial setting. The lights flickered, and several lights bled in various parts of the ceremony; a number of people were dancing around, and some were holding hands in the presence of their new Mistress.</p> <p>Sakura stood in front of Makura, and then walked around in front of him, her knees almost touching he knees. Sakura took one arm and wrapped it around his neck, making sure he didn't fall off, and guided him to a spot right in front of her. She guided him towards her, and then reached up and gently patted him on the shoulder, "You can kiss me if you like," she said, "I just had enough last night to get that off, and this time I want you to kiss me."</p> <p>He did as he was told, taking a few kisses from her lips before she closed her eyes and put her head on his shoulder and kissed him on the shoulder. He felt her hand on the back of his neck, and then he felt her lips on the back of his ear. He felt her tongue running along his ear as their tongues danced inside. He let him kiss but not lick a way. They just moved and pressed together. When that didn't seem to get out of hand, she gave him a little shove and broke the kiss, "Come on up to the altar and lie back on the floor," she said, "I want you to do a good job with my sex."</p> <p>He climbed up on the altar and put a foot on the floor at the foot of the altar. Now he was lying face up with his feet on the altar.</p> <p>She kneeled down beside him, she leaned down and gently laid her hands on his shoulders. She put a finger under his chin to pull his mouth down. And he looked at her, wondering as he opened his mouth, what he was supposed to do.</p> <p>"This is how you'll fuck me," the voice said.</p> <p>Sakura's hands went under his buttocks and lifted them up until his cock was resting on his belly button, "Oh," she said softly, and then he heard her voice, "You'll be able to get it up inside my body."</p> <p>His body automatically gave a jerk when her sex touched his cock. It must be good because he wasn't too excited and it was just his pride about the power. He felt her sex on the top.</p> <p>"Well it's going just the way I'd hoped," she said as she ran her fingers gently along the head of his cock.</p> <p>He felt her hand move further down from his shoulders, and then she had him bend his knees so his knees stood on the altar. She was going to put him in her and let him do it. But she didn't, and he felt her fingers pressing down gently so the head was pushing the folds of her sex up into her body. He then felt a little tug as her flesh was pushed firmly into the opening of his cock. And then he felt a tiny push of her hand and his flesh was engulfed.</p> <p>"God that feels good," he heard a soft moan. He felt her hand go down lower, moving his penis up against her flesh, as her other hand moved her hand up his body. Her fingers caressed the skin right at the tip of the crown, moving from the root to just below the crown—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
