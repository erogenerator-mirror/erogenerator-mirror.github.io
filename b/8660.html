With a quick glance at me, she made sure my eyes were looking hers, the expression there so close to mine and now clearly etched. And when I saw my look of confusion her face softened.</p> <p>"You seem surprised, don't you? I thought that I had made it clear that there would not be anything between us."</p> <p>I stared at her in silence. She stared back into my eyes, searching mine.</p> <p>"Well it didn't seem like that..."</p> <p>She reached out and put her hand on my shoulder, gently urging me away from the bench.</p> <p>"Stay, Matt."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Stay." I looked at her, stunned.</p> <p>"What are you doing? You can't just stop now. Can you?"</p> <p>"Mmmhmm."</p> <p>"Are you ready to stop now?"</p> <p>"What, you think I don't want more?"</p> <p>"I don't think I do. I know you've been waiting."</p> <p>"Mmmhmm."</p> <p>She didn't seem to know exactly where to take me, but I didn't mind. "Let's go."</p> <p>***</p> <p>She lead me from a little table where we had sat, leaving me a little more at ease. I was more accustomed to a table like this. We had talked about everything and anything in passing while we ate and chitchatted. And when I left the restaurant we started heading up a flight in the direction of the hospital.</p> <p>After the ride we had made the short walk up the ramp of a flight of stairs to the top. She led me back around one more time, then led me on down. Down another couple of flights I took her hand the first time we walked past the reception.</p> <p>Back in the suite she took charge of the room and I moved into it. We were almost right in front of the bar, one of many windows in the suite with plenty of light so she could watch us walk past and see what we were doing. We were both nervous, each of us afraid to touch the other, but we couldn't stop. So neither one of us said a word.</p> <p>The bed wasn't really the same as the bed in a room full of plush fluffy comforter and sheets. There was a table in front of the bed and a table in back. There was another table just like that, but it was more of a table than a bed. A table that actually used a lot of light now, it too had a lot of light and, besides, it could only dimly light the walls and ceiling a little bit.</p> <p>I watched her as she stepped out of the shower, her hair cascading down in a towel as she turned onto her stomach and I saw that her nipples were as hard as my cock had ever been. My hands went to my belt and undone it, freeing my raging erection, which I let slip down my thigh. I knew I wasn't doing it by any chance, my voice quivering a little, but I held back. I don't know if it was feeling sorry for herself and my guilt or the pleasure she was feeling from it, but the way she was leaning over the side of the bed, arms stretched out, staring back at me, naked except for a towel tied around her waist, only to be pushed off, her body swaying back and forth as she moved. It was all very sexual and it made me feel pretty, and very powerful also, but I forced myself to go with it, letting her get the attention she deserved, the feeling I knew she was ready for.</p> <p>"I have been looking forward to getting back into this room for sometime. The shower was wonderful and..." she got out between breaths, the words out before she had turned around. Her voice trailed off and she didn't talk anymore, instead, her eyes were looking back at me, as if trying to tell me what she wanted to say. I smiled, knowing that I was doing that.</p> <p>"...to be sure. It was so amazing...so intense...my own orgasm. That was so incredible. Are you ready for another?" She asked.</p> <p>"Let's see..." I had a sudden flashback to that morning when we had finally climbed into bed together, and I couldn't forget what we had just done.</p> <p>I reached for the towel, and she reached for mine.</p> <p>"Let's leave it on, Matt."</p> <p>"Okay." I moved my fingers from my side and started to slide the towel upward over her legs. At the last second I wrapped it around her hips, just above her breasts and then pulled the towel back in place. Her nipples were standing at attentionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
