Jason said. "This really is a long and complicated walk through the woods, with the wind coming in and out."</p> <p>His face was redder than ever. "Dance," Jason repeated. "I'm not sure where you are."</p> <p>Teddy leaned over and lightly touched Diana's cheek. "I said don't come to this spot alone."</p> <p>"And where are your friends?"</p> <p>She gave a little laugh, "They're in Atlanta. Or wherever the hell that is."</p> <p>"I just wanted to talk." Jason didn't expect her to be the one to break the silence. If he ever met her, she'd be his best friend.</p> <p>"Have a good time. It's nice to meet you."</p> <p>Her hand was soft, warm in his.</p> <p>"I look forward to seeing you again," Jason offered.</p> <p>"I hope you do."</p> <p>They stood there staring at the screen, and both of their minds racing from one decision to the next.</p> <p>When Jason came up with another offer, he had something that almost made him stop walking. "I really have to find a dance partner," Jason said. He thought how he could pay for those lessons now, and then get her back for him. For that matter, he'd probably be in jail for nearly three weeks.</p> <p>"I'll pick you up tomorrow night," he said.</p> <p>"Tomorrow night?" Diana said, her face bright with anticipation.</p> <p>"Uh-huh." She leaned up and kissed his cheek and then whispered in his ear, "Maybe we can dance."</p> <p>Jason didn't have the heart to refuse her, but he didn't want to spend his night alone. He needed time to reflect back to the time he'd spent with her.</p> <p>Jason took a quick sip of his drink and turned his attention back to the movie. "You ready to go to bed?" he asked when he had finished.</p> <p>"Sure. I'm in your car and maybe we can go to a local restaurant." The way her tone indicated that she was not going to sleep on the couch or in the middle of a storm made Jason think that she was a likely candidate for bed.</p> <p>"Oh, God. I think I'm going to die a little."</p> <p>He laughed, "It's not that. I'm too drunk and I don't care."</p> <p>In the dim light, he felt as secure as she felt. She was a very bright girl. He had to admit that he was right about the fact that she was really a bright young girl and there was no way she could have done it better. "You're right. I'll go," Jason said as he turned towards his own car.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"I hope I made up my mind," Diana said, staring intently at the flickering fire in the candle shop. She loved to smoke a cigarette, and it had been a very long time since she had held one in her life. Now it must be getting dark outside, and she really did want to light up.</p> <p>"You're not going to be doing any smoking tonight," Jason replied. "It's probably because we have a special date."</p> <p>"Maybe," Diana answered and then she continued to watch the flames dance across the flames.</p> <p>She looked over at the fire once more, admiring how the glow in the flame glowed in the firelight and radiated off the beautiful girl standing in front of it. She couldn't believe that everything she thought she was going to find here was actually right there in front of her.</p> <p>"I'm going to tell you what I think is really, really important to me," Diana said and then she exhaled deeply. "You can look at me if you want."</p> <p>Diana stood and walked over to stand in front of Jason.</p> <p>"I'll make you happy," Diana said and then she took his hand and pulled him forward. They began to walk in unison toward the door into Jason's basement.</p> <p>As she held Jason's hand, she could feel the energy of the moment slowly leave her, and then, as she looked down at her hand, she felt that she had not made up her mind what would happen.</p> <p>The firelight glowed even brighter, and Diana looked up and saw the expression on Jason's face. That look that reminded her, "Don't look at me, my dear. What's wrong with myself? You don't understand. Don't worry, I understand. We just have this problem. Don't worry. Don't worry. Let me explain."</p> <p>Theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
