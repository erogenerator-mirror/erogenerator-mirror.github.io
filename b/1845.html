She was breathing hard and her cheeks were pink.</p> <p>"It's okay." She answered and then looked back at him. "But we haven't had the time to..." She trailed off as her hand came down on his face and gently slapped him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." He said, pulling away again. He wiped his hair and his face with his arm, pulling his shirt as he went.</p> <p>"That was for me, it was not a bad thing. I'm sorry." She said.</p> <p>"No, it was for me too." He said in answer. "But this, it was for us. We are in love with one another. We are a couple. We aren't in love"</p> <p>"No! No! We're not in love!" She told him desperately.</p> <p>"We aren't, and no," he laughed softly. "You can't love someone you just met as though you are dating someone, then you find out a woman she is dating doesn't love you as they love you and they are hurt."</p> <p>He grabbed her hand again and put it back on his head as he leaned towards her again. "No, we shouldn't be doing this. We're not even going to be together. We never have been. When we do get together again, we will be better off. I'll make sure to call you back."</p> <p>"We better not. My friend in this house, my best friend, she will see us and will know."</p> <p>"No. No, not now. We have a lot of time to make this work. But as soon as you call the police, call me and I'll call the police. But I think you will like this."</p> <p>"No...no, I'm not like this. We aren't. I hate you. I'm not a lesbian." She said and threw her hands out to the side. "Fuck you! Fuck you now! I have to leave. We can talk about this and then maybe we can work out something."</p> <p>Her arms seemed to be trembling and she looked back at him in a kind of desperation. "No." He said in return. "I'll call you whenever I want."</p> <p>"No! No! It's not that. We can't talk about this. I'm sorry it's such an awkward situation though. Just go to sleep now." But he didn't move. He was thinking of all the reasons why he should call her, what to wear and what to do with his life and then he gave her one more chance. She was going to tell him that they were not going to be together and they better not be with others. But...the other side of the coin she had for him was that he probably felt guilty because he would feel jealous or worse and he knew how she felt about that, but that didn't make him angry. He did feel like it was his fault because they were a couple but he never once felt like he had just gotten a kiss or a hug or a handshake. No, this was different.</p> <p>But he had to go.</p> <p>"Okay. Let me go. Just hang up...we need to talk...I mean" He said to himself. He took his keys and put them in his pocket and took off out the front door.</p> <p>He could not get his mind off what she said and the idea that he was being honest and upfront with her. He couldn't be as open as she was when talking to him. He had to just go.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Chapter Five: We just have to start somethingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
