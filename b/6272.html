That's why you have to say 'yes'. If you say, 'No'. Then they'll really see it."</p> <p>And so it was that they discovered my wife really did have quite a tight pussy, and could cum easily on command, but as time went around we started talking about everything from school days to marriage and then to the future.</p> <p>When Sarah was born she was also a virgin, having only ever had one boyfriend before her, and her only one had been a long-term relationship, and it hadn't been much of fun at all. She was a good sport about everything and did everything that came naturally, as long as the mood came round, no questions asked. So after a couple of years, we both decided to make our decision and had sex. I'd had lots of experience in the past.</p> <p>Although I'd enjoyed fucking Sarah, I had always wondered if there was a chance of my wife getting pregnant at some stage. The chance that she'd get married, which wouldn't be big with the age difference, was slim, but I decided to just have it for a little while yet to see what happened.</p> <p>I made myself a fresh drink and sat on the sofa as Sarah entered the room, wearing a tiny negligee that barely covered her. She leaned towards me and with the glass in her hand she kissed me lightly on the cheek making me want to kiss her again, but then quickly pulled away.</p> <p>"We need to talk about me first."</p> <p>She turned back to her husband, still sitting quietly in the armchair.</p> <p>"Sarah, I don't know if we're ready to do this. You know you're going to get yourself knocked up. I'm not sure if you want this to be my maiden voyage or your future, if it is or is just a really good feeling. It is a bit scary, but if the time is right it will be great, at the same time that I get to be your lover and get to have a baby. And, what does it really all matter at the end of the night?"</p> <p>His face lit up, "It doesn't really matter. You're doing it because you love me and don't want to let me go."</p> <p>"No but I'm not sure that's the same thing."</p> <p>"Look, Sarah. Even if we didn't love each other then it didn't matter, I'll happily be your lover. I think you'd be fantastic as well, and I want to fuck you until you can't walk."</p> <p>She giggled. "You're so romantic."</p> <p>"No really!"</p> <p>"What do you think?"</p> <p>"I think I love you a little more than any man I've ever known or had the pleasure to experience; and if I am going to be able to go through life doing whatever the hell I want doing it with you I want you to be part of it. The only question is how will you feel afterwards?"</p> <p>He smiled. "I love you and don't want to do anything that'll cause you pain, but at the same time I have to love you more than anything in the world. But I will love you with all my heart, not if your decision is right, won't I?"</p> <p>"Yes you will."</p> <p>"But it's your decision, you're a big man and I'm a very young woman, aren't I? And I have to find people to do me. I don't want to be your teacher or your mum. I want you to be my lover and my friend, no matter what."</p> <p>That little pause, then his arms around her and his lips kissing her. I watched as he pulled her towards him and her tongue thrust into his mouth making him shudder. And she put her arms around him and kissed him some more. I heard a faint squeal of delight from her and could see Sarah's legs getting unsteady, which I'm sure would have meant there might be no more room for them there.</p> <p>I sat there, unable to move. I'd never liked Sarah so much after the first time she'd fucked me (we'd have to come up with a new term for the 'first time'.). After a couple of minutes she let herself fall to the sofa with a sigh and sat with her head on his chest.</p> <p>"Thank you, that was lovely, I really needed that feeling of having a real lover again."</p> <p>He kissed the top of her head; her cheekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
