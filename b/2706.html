I was pleased that it seemed that we would get another chance to find out more about each other. There were definitely some things that we both liked about each others skin color. After lunch, when we had finished eating, the two of us got ready to go meet up on Thursday, at the bar I invited our friends to join us there. As the guys agreed, we were now the only ones there. The girls said they wished to meet all the men there, so I figured that they wished to go somewhere with me, and I agreed to wait for awhile. My cock had been getting hard to this point, but that was probably to let us know that it had gone back to normal, although to be fair, it also seemed to be getting bigger at the thought of being with all those guys. As the bell rang, I got the chance to sit down with Jake, and we started making small talk. At one point we were laughing and discussing the night, when one of the guys who was sitting beside me suddenly said that something must be wrong with me, so we left it alone. About a half hour later, the door opened and it was Sarah, who sat on the bed next to me. She gave me a warm smile, and I think that the look on her face made me think that we were getting along just fine.</p> <p>"I thought you would want to join us!" Sarah said.</p> <p>"We sure do! The guys at Club Med wanted to do a threesome with my friend, and I thought that you might like to join us!" I countered. "But we're still our friends... so we'll see what happens when we meet up tonight!" I added.</p> <p>"You're right." Sarah laughed. "It's not like you could keep your head under your own control here."</p> <p>"I guess that I can. So far, we haven't even been out yet, and our friends do seem like they haven't come a long way yet..." I continued.</p> <p>"Yeah.... so we'd probably be a little more in the know about what to do... if we go out again!" Sarah replied. "So why don't you come along."</p> <p>"Ohhhh.... ok, I guess... I guess." I said, feeling quite unsure where this was going. However, I also didn't want to appear like a wimp or something.</p> <p>"Ok.... Let me ask you something. Have you ever had three guys at once... at once?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>"No. Actually, I've never tried it! Maybe after all we've been through today!" I answered. I think that my face got slightly red because if I couldn't tell you how long I had been on the receiving end of such a suggestion, I would have come right back with it. However, when I said that I wasn't gay, I didn't really do so well. Sarah saw the hesitation in my face as well as the way that I was looking at her.</p> <p>"What are you thinking?!" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm thinking about trying that out with two guys at once! Wouldn't you too!?" I asked in response.</p> <p>"You're kidding me..." I answered, and then added "It's not like that at all."</p> <p>Sarah giggled at this, and said, "Oh really?" After saying this, she got up after a second and said, "Go on! We'll watch tv together, and get a few shots at you!" With this, she closed the door and went back to the couch, where my friends were sitting.</p> <p>"Ok... I didn't really think that... so I guess I did it just in case....." I asked. I didn't have any problem with two guys at once, and I certainly didn't have any problem with doing it with my first two guys that I hadn't been with before. After all, it was a one time thing; so I was sure that it would be okay with most of us. After a second or two, Sarah reached behind her, and took off her pants and panties. She got back onto the bed, where I got on the side of her and started kissing her breasts as I gently touched her pussy.</p> <p>"Ooooohhhhh.... that feels nice..." Sarah sighed. "I'm glad that you agree."</p> <p>We both just listened to the sounds, and started caressing each other's pussy. We also started to kiss each other's nipples when we heard a click from the door of the den. At this point, another voice could be heard, and it was Amy, a friend that the girls had gone out with. She must now have guessed what we had been doing in there.</p> <p>"Are you two still in there?" I heard from Amy's voice and I looked over to see her smiling.</p> <p>"Sure areâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
