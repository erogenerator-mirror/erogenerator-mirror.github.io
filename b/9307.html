She looked away, embarrassed, "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry." She didn't feel ashamed; she felt so safe, with the things she thought she'd always had. This was the part of her that would be left outside her own self as the only one she could tell how she felt.</p> <p>"That's okay. It's okay." Kyle said. He ran his hands through her hair, and then up her back. He was startled when he felt his cock press against her leg. No, not just her legs, he thought. "This isn't just a part of me, right? You felt it this whole evening you could tell." Kyle said.</p> <p>"I've noticed for a while now that it's been like that thing between us. I thought it might have been just my imagination that caused it. And I'm not sure I was thinking right." She said. "I'm not that big."</p> <p>"Well, I think that might have something to do with your being in a trance, as well, so I'm going to try to distract you some, if you want." Kyle said. He bent down, grabbed her chin and said, "Trust me." He lowered his head then slowly, softly, kissed her lips. "You're gonna feel strange, like you might just fall asleep when you fall asleep." He said. He knew that would give him cause to go into his trance. He also wondered if he'd get an erection while he was in his trance.</p> <p>Kyle stood up, and began kissing her neck as he stood. He kissed his way down to her heaving chest. He felt her nipples harden against his lips as he took them in his mouth and sucked a little. "You want me to stop?" She said breathily. He just chuckled at her. He kissed his way slowly down her stomach then kissed his way to her thighs where he found her wet sex.</p> <p>Sue sighed, and looked down at him. "Are you sure? You're pretty sure?" She was breathing, and her body tensed. She was aroused, and her hand was at her breast as it lay on her nipple.</p> <p>Kyle smiled, "I don't think I can hold back. I've wanted you this night for months. Do you remember that night?" He said, his voice taking on a husky, needy tone.</p> <p>"Oh, I do." She said as she looked down at him.</p> <p>"That is, if you don't mind."</p> <p>"That depends on what you're thinking." Her voice gave pause, "This isn't exactly right. That is really all I could feel." She said.</p> <p>"I want to help. Let me make you feel better." Kyle said. He bent down and ran his tongue over her lips, and into them, which caused her to gasp.</p> <p>Sue could feel the heat seeping into her own pussy like the heat from the fire. "You're going to make me feel really good." She whispered.</p> <p>"You want me to make you feel good?" Kyle said. Sue felt her eyes widen as she looked down at him.</p> <p>"I want you." She whispered loudly.</p> <p>"Let me show you this next door trick you know." Kyle said as he knelt on the floor in front of her. He reached up and took her right nipple into his mouth.</p> <p>Sue closed her eyes as she felt the warmth of the fire dance up her nipple. As Kyle sucked on her nipple, she felt him push a finger into her cunt. The sensation took her breath away. She felt her hips buck and gyrate. She was aching for the fire to be released.</p> <p>Kyle saw the reaction in her eyes and lowered his head. He took the rigid nipple into his mouth and nibbled lightly. Sue gave an "UHHHHHHHHH," as every muscle in her body tensed. "Are you okay?" Kyle said as he raised his head. He looked at her face, and grinned as he lowered his head.</p> <p>"Oh my God. I can't believe it. That was incredible!" Sue said as she looked down at him.</p> <p>"Yeah, it was. You feel really good, baby." Kyle said as he lowered his tongue and slid it into her wet pussy.</p> <p>Sue moaned softly as Kyle slid his tongue deeply, slowly inside her. Her mind was awash with the feelings that were flooding her mind. She was in love with this man, with him the man she desired in the most intimate way. It felt good to be wanted so. "I love you." She whispered into Kyle's ear.</p> <p>Kyle slid his tongue out from deep within her and began fucking her faster, as he knew would give her pleasure. He could feel the muscles inside her body begin to contract, almost as if she was trying toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
