I'd really let you do your part and be ready for me when we get married, okay?" She gave me one more big hug and one more kiss.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you every day, Jen," I told her. "I've never felt like this with any other woman."</p> <p>The three of us laughed for a few moments that seemed like it was interminable. The whole episode was turning me on more than it had in a long time.</p> <p>"Okay," she said to me, "but I was afraid it was going to be that night that you were going to lose you cherry to that hot cock of yours all over again. But if that works for you, I've wanted you for a long time now. Can you forgive me? Are you free to go if you want to continue?"</p> <p>"Yes," I told her. "I'll keep my promise," I told her. "Thank you for that opportunity, Jen," I said.</p> <p>"No," she said to me, "I'm going to call you tonight. If you've got a day to yourself, it's your call. I think we should go to a movie tonight. You can call my number and I'd love to hear you say that to me."</p> <p>"I'm sure you will," I told her, "and we'll keep our promises and not call each other all this time."</p> <p>We talked through dinner and then I called the time that would let me know that she would be home later in the evening. The next morning, Jen got a call from the school board that would be announcing her pregnancy the next week. With my parents out of the way for the day, there was only one way to get that information though. We had discussed it many times. I got a phone call from her that let me know that she had decided to be a nurse. They had a board that would be in touch with her pregnancy and birth and the doctor would take notes of everything and make a decision later.</p> <p>I had some concerns about being pregnant with Jen that I was afraid they wouldn't give me any of the support they would be willing to give me. They were going to be going to the same school they had been.</p> <p>Jen looked at me with my parents and smiled, "Do you have to go?" Jennifer was about to have another child but she remembered that that was not going to happen just yet. She was now going to have a full grown woman on every level of her being.</p> <p>"Not so fast," was my reply to her.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, suddenly serious, "you can't get married in that state, can you?" she said, "I'll be glad when I get married and I'll be home."</p> <p>"Alright," I answered, surprised but happy. "I think the only thing I want is for you to stay home and be my girlfriend. I know I've never been that for you, Jen but we both know that it will never work, we both know it will be an opportunity other guys give away when you tell them that you're pregnant," I told her. I knew that I should have taken the risk to stay out of this situation.</p> <p>Jen was quiet for a minute or so after the discussion and then I heard her say, "Well, you know what, it wouldn't be right for my dad to get up in the morning and come over in time to pick me up and come home late." I didn't tell her what she had to do to get my dad to do it. When I told her I thought it might have given her something to think about, I didn't elaborate. When she got a quick hug and a quick kiss on the cheek, she gave me a withering look and said, "I'm going to have to wait until the day after Christmas break. Then I'll talk you into coming home and not coming home until it's over," she quickly concluded.</p> <p>She told me that the next night would be a little different because I was going to have to come home on time and not come home early. She had already spoken with Mom and Dad and they had agreed to postpone my visit until then if at all I wanted to talk with her about that night. They had also agreed that they would not ask for a repeat. My parents had no problems with it because I wouldn't have to go home anyway.</p> <p>That night in bed, Jen was still wearing my little white night shirt. I was sitting up against the headboard at a time and her shirt felt wonderful against my thighs.</p> <p>"Jen," I sighed quietly. "You look wonderful."</p> <p>"Thank you," she said softly, placing her arms around my waist.
