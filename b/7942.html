Or would I still feel left out?"</p> <p>"I think you still want to. We can do that right now."</p> <p>"No, I want you to just leave me be. I'm not going to do anything else."</p> <p>"Please go back to your room and close your door. You said I can do whatever you want, anytime you want me to if you give me a chance. Whatever you want."</p> <p>"Alright, but can I go to my room with you? Your choice?"</p> <p>She didn't really have a choice. This would be her decision. She could stay the night with him or she could get dressed up and go back home. She decided on taking him back upstairs to her room and then make her bed. She had always hated lying down in the sun, but she did think that she would feel better if she got out of that sun room. She got out of bed and dried herself with a small towel. She didn't really bother to put on a bra again. The sight of her firm, round breasts glistened from the afternoon sun. She picked up the blue bikini she had worn the week before and headed back downstairs.</p> <p>The next morning, Sarah got up early, got her usual breakfast and went down to meet her friends. All were present in the room. She was pretty disappointed. There was no telling how many men had been in the room this morning. She didn't want to disappoint the rest of them. Before she left, she made sure the towel was pulled tightly around her and then she slipped quietly out the door.</p> <p>She stopped outside the door of the girls' room and knocked on the door. No one answered. She heard the sound of someone peeing through the door. A few seconds later, she heard the door open and then close. In a few seconds, she could tell where they were. She knocked once more and stepped into the hallway and knocked again. She didn't hear any response. She pulled the door open a bit and peered out through the slit in the door. She didn't see them. She was looking for the shower stalls and she hadn't gone very far. Her heart had dropped when it did. Just what was she thinking? Why was she thinking all these thoughts?! What was she doing? Did I just walk into some strange house?</p> <p>She closed the door as quietly as she could and stepped into the middle of the open stall. She looked down. The first thing she saw was her reflection. Her eyes were watery and she had a towel wrapped over her wet hair. It barely covered her breasts but her nipples poked through the top of the green fabric. Her left nipple looked angry red. Her other nipple was also clearly erect. What was she thinking?! She just stared. She couldn't help it. Her stomach clenched and she shook her head. She walked forward again trying to get some measure of courage. She realized that if she kept her eyes on the mirror, it might help in some way. She slowly moved closer and then back into the open stall to put more distance between herself and the mirror. She could close the door now and then so that she could get a measure of the effect that would be expected from the effect. She closed the door quickly before they could see her moving up behind them. She could turn around to face the mirror in the back. She could still not say anything. In all these thoughts, she was acting like a little girl. As she looked into the mirror at herself, she saw what she had seen in the mirrors. The mirror had her staring back at her reflection who was the object of her desire.</p> <p>She started to cry a little. She had finally succumbed to this wild impulse and wanted to be free as much as possible. She started to look out of the mirror herself. On her hands and knees, she reached behind herself to her sides and ran her hands into her hair. She turned her head to see if anyone else was there and she could see nothing.</p> <p>"I am so ashamed." she thought. Even out of the door of the girl's room, she felt ashamed. She wanted to run to the showers and wash the feeling of shame off of her.</p> <p>She had been too afraid to try to escape, she thought. Her whole world had gotten all too real and she felt like an animal. Even her boyfriend, David, had been too scared to try. She couldn't really move. She simply ran ahead towards the showers and the other shower. She could not see who was at the other side of the glass door. The first time she walked to them, there was no way in which she was going to run back so she went right inside and got into the shower stall with the door closed.</p> <p>There were two showerheads next to the door. When she turned on the water, she felt the warm water spray all over her. She couldn't see how she had gotten a shower.
