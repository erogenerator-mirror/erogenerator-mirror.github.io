"I've never done all that. I guess I have my preferences," she said in a sultry voice. She walked over to the bed and sat down. "I need some help."</p> <p>His mouth watered for her. His eyes seemed to be focused on her face. He moved in closer. She noticed him take in the sight of her ass. She stood up on her knees and started to undo the buttons on his shirt. "No. Wait," she said as she felt his shirt open. "Allow me."</p> <p>She began taking off his shirt and was about to take off his pants when John reached under her chin and pulled her up from her feet. He pulled her toward him with one arm around her, and brought her back to her feet.</p> <p>He reached up and pulled down her bra. "There," he smiled at his hard on, "I think I am more comfortable there."</p> <p>"I can see you like how it looks," she said, pulling her bra down. He dropped to his knees and took her breast in his mouth. Her nipple hardened to his tongue and lips. He took it into his wet mouth and began to suckle it. She moaned, her body feeling weak. "John, oh, come back!" she said, trying to push him away.</p> <p>He pulled up. "No. Stop! I can't take much more," she said. She watched his erect penis as it began to swell. She felt her pussy moisten. "Come back, John!" she cried as she grabbed him by the back of his head and pulled him back. She pulled him forward, kissing him.</p> <p>"God, John!" she cried as she pulled him toward her. He pushed himself inside her, burying himself deeply within her. She felt his cock press against her cervix, and began to thrust upward as he began to move in and out and her clit rubbed across her clitoris. "Oh god!" she cried as he pressed into her.</p> <p>"You like it?" he asked, thrusting into her, rubbing his tongue across her lips and clit. That got her feeling, and she moaned. It was too much and she shook as she came. She had never felt this feeling before. His cock drove deeply into her and she felt his body stiffen as his cock began to jerk. Then the hot cum was filling her as he held the back of her neck. She felt every pulse of his cock and knew that he was cumming. Their bodies, separated by the sheets, were completely satisfied.</p> <p>After several minutes he collapsed on top of her. He kissed her neck and ears, gently stroking her breast, which he felt and felt so soft and full. His cock softened in response and he pulled out of her. She felt his cock soften and pulled down. She laid his head on her shoulder and drifted off to sleep herselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
