Go back to your room—and keep your eyes closed. No one will notice."</p> <p>"Is that ok?"</p> <p>"That makes sense, but you're sure you don't mind?"</p> <p>"Of course not."</p> <p>I closed my eyes and tried to go back to sleep.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I woke up, the sheets were still wet with sweat, and I was still naked. I could tell from the scent of the room that the two girls were making breakfast. I could hear dishes being set out and chairs and a few dishes turning into plates. I just hoped I didn't wake them up.</p> <p>I sat up and stretched. When I walked, I looked around the room to see if I didn't see anyone standing outside the door. I opened it just a bit to see if any of the kitchen was still open, but there was no one in sight.</p> <p>"Morning, sleepy-head!" the girl in the doorway said.</p> <p>"Good morning!" I exclaimed as I walked towards her.</p> <p>I grabbed her with my body and carried her into the kitchen. I started washing breakfast dishes while I looked around to see if anyone was still looking.</p> <p>"What's your name," she asked after a minute of thinking.</p> <p>"I'm Kelli," I replied.</p> <p>"Hi, Kelli," I replied.</p> <p>"Are you here because your girlfriends went to get your parents?" she asked.</p> <p>"I am," I replied.</p> <p>"You know I haven't dated anyone since I left Austin last spring, right?" Kelli asked.</p> <p>"Yes, but... no," I answered.</p> <p>"That sucks! I'm going to need you to be a good girl, Kelli. You seem like you can tell people, even if they don't know your real age."</p> <p>"I'll never do anything to make you change your mind," I replied.</p> <p>"Kelli, I know I should just stop and leave, but I don't. Please don't force yourself to do anything. Just promise me that you'll do something with me," I pleaded.</p> <p>"Will you try to come back, if I can, Kelli?"</p> <p>"I promise!" I smiled.</p> <p>"I don't know, but promise me you'll spend the night with me. Just promise me that you'll come back and make love to me before the night is over," Kelli said.</p> <p>I turned Kelli towards our house and we hugged. Her body was very nice and I could see the outline of her breasts against her thin T-shirt.</p> <p>"I'd really like to, if you would," I said as I led my sister back into the living room.</p> <p>I helped Kelli down off the table and we both walked around to our room. I unlocked the door and we stood there for a moment and Kelli let my arm go with hers. The front door opened when it was shut, but Kelli didn't close it again. Our hearts pounding, I turned around, gave her a big hug and told her that I really missed her. She wrapped us both in a warm embrace and kissed me.</p> <p>"That was great," Kelli exclaimed as she hugged me. "What did you think of the other nights you made love with my cousin?"</p> <p>"It was great," I replied.</p> <p>Kelli turned around and kissed me again; this time even closer. Our lips brushed as our tongues went into each other's mouth. Slowly, my hand was placed under Kelli's T-shirt, my fingers brushed along the bare flesh of her breast as my other hand slid under the elastic band of her panties.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, it feels good," Kelli whispered in my ear, "and nice,"</p> <p>I could feel Kelli pushing herself into me as our kiss continued. I felt Kelli's hand begin to pull down my shorts and I raised my hips so I could pull her shirt up over her breasts, then she pulled down my shorts, followed by my briefs. My hard dick sprang out as I let Kelli remove my briefs and my cock stood straight out.</p> <p>Kelli took her own time removing my shirt and then she pulled me back into the embrace. Kissing me deeply again, we walked back to the bed where Kelli lay me down and we lay in each others arms.</p> <p>We kissed again as Kelli's hand slipped down under my briefs, brushing my dick while our tongues continued to dance. Kelli's hand slid down my chest and her hand found my prick.</p> <p>"Mmmm, it still looks big," she remarked.</p> <p>Kelli began to stroke my cock with her hand; then she slid my briefs off and I helped her off her shorts and briefs. Kelli lay—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
