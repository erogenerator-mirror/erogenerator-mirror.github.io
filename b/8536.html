"Maybe he should take a nap on the couch."</p> <p>"I don't know. I haven't had a nap for about two months. I haven't had a man in months," she said. "Besides, I haven't had a cock in two months in the whole time."</p> <p>"I know you haven't."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Are you really interested in having a threesome with one man and two women?"</p> <p>"Do you think they will fuck me or the other?"</p> <p>I looked at her in disbelief. "What? I thought you had a choice about the three of us. What will you do with them?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I might have them lick my pussy and play with my nipples and do all kinds of other things."</p> <p>I was just stunned for a second or two. She was completely serious and that shocked me even more. That is, until I heard the doorbell downstairs. She stood there for a minute and then walked to the door. I heard the doorbell ring.</p> <p>"That was the bell when I heard the bell," she said.</p> <p>"But I thought you were going to change your mind?" I asked.</p> <p>"No it's my body language. I know it will sound crazy, but it's my body language when I get nervous."</p> <p>She went back to her chair and went to her bedroom. I followed her. I heard her take the clothes off the couch and sit down beside her. I took a seat as well and sat there watching her as she lay back on the couch and began playing with her nipples. I watched them and I watched her play with herself. I wasn't hard in an instant, but I felt like I was getting hard watching my wife being sexually played with.</p> <p>It didn't take too long before she started to shake. My cock was almost ready to burst. I didn't want to come before the deal was played out, so I decided to play with her longer. I sat up and kneeled between her legs. I leaned forward and put my hands behind her knees. I slowly lifted them until they were straight up. We were both trembling as I looked at her pussy and then up at her face. "I want you to lick me while you eat me. I want you to make me come."</p> <p>She looked down at me and smiled. "That sounds wonderful to me. I love licking your cock. Can we do that later?"</p> <p>I stood up on the other side of the couch and lifted her head towards me. A small moan escaped her lips as she began to plant soft kisses on the head. I watched her eyes travel up and down me, taking in the scene. I had my eyes closed so I couldn't see her smile, but when she opened my eyes and saw hers, I felt the most awesome sense of arousal. I opened my eyes and saw her smiling up at me with a devilish look in her face.</p> <p>"My turn," she said. "Let's do it together this time."</p> <p>I sat on the floor, lifted her legs over my shoulders, and began eating her pussy. She put her fingers in her mouth to wet them and then lowered her legs around my head. I had my mouth fastened to a pussy I wanted to eat for hours. I felt her hands gripping my head and then, I could feel her pussy tensed up.</p> <p>"I'm coming," she yelled. Her body shook so violently I thought it would fall off the couch. I kept licking her while she came, but not wanting to leave her wet, I slowed down on her. She pulled me up by my shoulders and kissed me passionately.</p> <p>"God, that was awesome," she said. "Are you ready for more of this?"</p> <p>She helped me off her legs. I watched as she slid down to her knees. She took my cock in her hand and began stroking up and down as she slowly lowered her head. I felt the warmth coming from her mouth and realized it was warm and wet. I looked down and saw her mouth close around my cock as her tongue licked all around, making me squirm some. It began to feel good and my cock began to twitch and rise to her throat. She kept stroking. It felt amazing. It felt as though we were on a mission. It seemed like she was having a full day of doing nothing but pleasing me. I closed my eyes and enjoyed it. I was in heaven. I was in hell.</p> <p>"It's my turn now," she said as she began to rise up my cock.</p> <p>I watched as she positioned herself on top of me, her pussy slowly lowering onto my cock.
