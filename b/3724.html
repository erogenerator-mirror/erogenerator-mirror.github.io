You can't even sit down yet!"</p> <p>"You have to."</p> <p>"You really have to help me make love!"</p> <p>A woman's voice said, "Please, go ahead."</p> <p>"I can't go through this again." I said.</p> <p>"Come on."</p> <p>"Don't be so sure!" I said.</p> <p>"Of course my dear."</p> <p>She helped me off the bench with the straps, then she wrapped my legs to the bench and hooked the straps. Then she held the strap between my legs, I could reach but my hands were just so big. In a minute it was done.</p> <p>"Well I guess we are done, now you can't go through this again!"</p> <p>"I have no more of it left for you, just like always!"</p> <p>She smiled at me. "You aren't so bad," she said. "Especially knowing you love it."</p> <p>I thought I had passed out on the bench. I was just feeling tired. This was the most intense experience I ever had. It was more than just about sex, it was about sex being loved, about sex being the most important thought in a woman's life, knowing she loves it, feeling it, loving when it happens. I was still scared and it did nothing to make me feel better. If anybody had even a clue what was important in a woman's body, it looked pretty damn good to me.</p> <p>I felt relieved to have the whole thing over with. I felt really great.</p> <p>"Well, I am going to take the first shower!" I said. "I will see you in the morning."</p> <p>"I will be waiting for you!" She replied. "My pussy needs some loving before we go."</p> <p>"Come!" I said.</p> <p>She turned and headed for the showers. I followed her. This was my first time with anyone. I did my shower first, it didn't take long. I was feeling better in a way I had with a girl and it was going great. I had never been in one this big before. There were people inside the shower area, but not in them. I couldn't see but I had a pretty good idea what someone was doing. I was in heaven! I was lucky I ended up with a shower that included her! I had never done anything like that before!</p> <p>I went right to sleep. When I took that first shower, I could hardly get it up. I must have slept for fifteen minutes. When I climbed out and the water came back to me, I felt good. I took note of it, that I was feeling some stress. I dried my hair and walked out to the locker. I pulled out a pair of boxer shorts, put them on, then sat on the bench next to where she was getting herself ready to take her shower.</p> <p>I took her towel off and we walked away from the locker and walked straight into her bedroom.</p> <p>"I have to do my stuff too." I said. "This will come a little later."</p> <p>She had some clothes for her which she stuffed into a sports bag. "Oh, I will take those too!" she said with a smile. "I love your sports!"</p> <p>We started putting the towels in the bag. We were going to shower in the locker. I knew she would have to go in first. That is until she could get a blanket that she was using in her bedroom. I didn't have anything to wear in the locker. I would be putting on one of my clothes at the drop of a hat if I could just pull on my towel.</p> <p>I pulled on the sports bag and was feeling pretty good again. I checked myself out in the mirror, I looked pretty good in my white shirt and gray boxer shorts. I wondered what my body looked like in the shower. I did my hair in the locker and put my stuff in there. We got our stuff and started out to her bedroom. I felt so guilty I couldn't help but laugh. I went in first, I took off my shirt and shorts in the locker. When we entered our bedroom, we were immediately taken aback at what we saw, I must have been the first to be seen. A young women was in the same room, but she wasn't looking at what we were doing though.</p> <p>I stopped to look at my friend and she was in the same room, and so she couldn't have seen us. She was looking at my crotch with a sly smile, "What do you think?" she asked.</p> <p>I was confused. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
