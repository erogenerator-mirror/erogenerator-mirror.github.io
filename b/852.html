She said softly.</p> <p>"I think so, too," I said. "So far, so good."</p> <p>"M-may I?" She whispered.</p> <p>"I suppose there's a certain point where you want to ask about anal sex," I suggested.</p> <p>She nodded. "Maybe I just want to know what it feels like. It's very hard to describe, I'd have to guess. You must tell me. I guess since you haven't." She leaned forward again and looked at the dildo. "This could be fun."</p> <p>I looked at the harness. I loved the idea of a harness that made it look like a little penis, that it would look so out of whack and stuff. I'd gotten that dildo on the internet and wondered if they would feel as good as I had hoped for.</p> <p>"I think we have the answer, yes, probably. How many did you pick up?" I asked her.</p> <p>"That's all that I knew. I've found all kinds of things."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"This. It feels like your cock is really in there, a little thick. Really thick. I can't believe I like it. You're a big guy. I'm glad that's what I needed." She sounded genuinely enthusiastic.</p> <p>"I think that would be great," I said, reaching over to hold an end of the cock in her hand. "I've had that dildo for a long time now. I guess I'm not going to be the only one with a penis hanging out there, either."</p> <p>"I think you should go first. I think that we can do both," she said. "In fact, what we just talked about earlier, that's just part of what we're doing. I know of a way where we can both go at the same time. Let's go and see where the dildo ends up?"</p> <p>"I think so," I said, "but we'll get back to that later."</p> <p>"What's the matter?" She asked, with concern in her tone.</p> <p>"I can't believe that we actually get to do this, though I could get to a point where you want to do anything. I just can't do anything with you. No touching, no teasing, no trying to make love. I just want to do what you want. Right now." I paused for a moment at her expression, not sure I was up to this. I knew what was about to happen. It was a very unique experience.</p> <p>"Are you sure? I haven't really thought about it."</p> <p>"Well, I have thought about some things," I said after a moment of consideration. "I think that I'll probably be able to find the right guy for me. Maybe I could get the guy who is interested in me to come down to my office and let me work with him for a bit on the job. It sounds really nice. And of course, he could fuck me in front of your wife."</p> <p>"I understand," she said as she stood up, "but that doesn't seem to be such a big enough reason for you to go to her office. What if they do it while her husband is gone?"</p> <p>"But, it would probably just be fair in a sense. Maybe even fun," I said, "but there's nothing wrong with having sex with my wife while other people are with her. And you're married, right?"</p> <p>She thought for a moment. "Yes, but if that's what you're thinking of. Well, maybe we can do something like that."</p> <p>"How are you doing that? I don't understand. I just want to. Let me."</p> <p>"Of course I'm thinking of doing it, Paul. What can I say?"</p> <p>"Then let's do it," I said with a huge grin on my face.</p> <p>"What? No. I can't go to your office. You can't do this."</p> <p>"So? Here you are, too, with a big cock hanging out. And it'll be fun."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"Just relax. I'll just go for it. There's no hurry. I can give you a really great time if you want. I'd just go down to the restroom and wait until they are out of site."</p> <p>I was surprised at how serious she was, but there was nothing I could do about that. She was probably just about to go to my office when I spoke. "Well, what if she asks me to come down then. That's going to be too much. We could just stay there. You could watch for a while, then come back here."</p> <p>She shook her headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
