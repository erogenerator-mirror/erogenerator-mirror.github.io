I know what I heard, from a friend, a man who was my friend, that day. And when I started thinking about it in detail, I heard my own voice tell him that I could take all of you, every square inch of you, anytime. And now, he was here, watching. And I knew it. He knew. Even while watching me take myself from under him and into his arms, feeling as he always did.</p> <p>The last thing I remembered about that night was that I was kissing his mouth. I had his lower lip between mine, sucking that last bit of his for our lives, kissing like a girl, my heart racing with the memory of what had happened at the end. I wondered what he was thinking about, what he would think of my kissing him like that. I remembered kissing his cheeks and the way it made him melt.</p> <p>All over again, he had pulled me closer to him, crushing my breasts against him, squeezing my ass with both hands, my hips grinding into his as I rode him. I could see the look of excitement that flashed in his eyes. He was so excited, so eager, it took me by surprise.</p> <p>"We need to stop," I whispered breathlessly. I heard him moan just before my body stiffened and shuddered as though I had been electrocuted. It was something inside of me you never could have imagined.</p> <p>"Yes or no?" he asked, breaking me from my trance.</p> <p>And then we were asleep, our naked bodies intertwined, his hot seed deep inside my belly, his cock growing harder in my pussy.</p> <p>It only took a few seconds of lying there like that, to be completely and utterly satisfied by my lover, my best friend. When he got home that first time, we'd been at it for the next week. We had sex all the time, or at least that's what the friends we used to hang out with, told him. We were not going to let any of that talk stop us.</p> <p>But that was a long time. And I wanted him back even more. Even if it got us nowhere on a permanent basis.</p> <p>I knew that even after all this time, I knew I wanted him in even more of a physical, emotional, and sexual way. If I weren't married to him at the time, we would have done anything. He was my man, my husband. We would have made a perfect husbandâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
