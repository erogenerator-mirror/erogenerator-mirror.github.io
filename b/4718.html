I asked while I ate.</p> <p>"Her friend and I went to see them, and we were there for a while and got to know each other pretty well."</p> <p>"A bit of that?"</p> <p>"Yeah, we were sitting around talking for a while, she was asking about me. She didn't have a boyfriend, and I didn't have one, so we just got to talking. She even asked me how I was feeling about the world while I was in college, and I told her that I hadn't felt this good in years. She just took it as a compliment and asked if I knew that what people meant by our love life was even going to happen. I told her that if she really believed me then, then I loved her no matter what."</p> <p>"I could use the love in that, there, and I guess I did."</p> <p>"Anyway, after that, and after seeing that redhead, my love and love for her grew to where you might think I was crazy, but, it became part of our friendship. I still think that she was a complete turn-on, and it was very much the reason I asked her to go out. I think there's someone out there that loves all you and doesn't leave you alone with an excuse to get out. It's as simple as going out," she explained.</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"And I guess, I have to admit that I haven't acted on some of the feelings that I have had since I started dating. She has been the perfect girlfriend, and I'm happy, so I think that I'm still in love with her."</p> <p>"Do you still think about her often?" It was now a little after noon, and it was my turn to talk.</p> <p>"Well, now that we're out of the house, yes, when we get back together, she will do more than talk to me. That part of our life has gotten out of control," she said sitting up.</p> <p>"How do things usually go?"</p> <p>"We never talk about it because none of us knew if we would say it, but it's hard to say when you know so much that all you need is someone to hold you. I do know that I'll never be able to say no to anything you say to me. It's as if no one has ever left you," she smiled. "And I could be a lot of things!"</p> <p>"I wish there was something that I could say that might make it right," I answered.</p> <p>"I know what I'm saying. You should try some of those stories," she laughed.</p> <p>"Do they come close to what I thought you did, and I can't believe I did," I asked.</p> <p>"No," she answered, "they're not quite that different. I mean, I did it all the way through college when I was a little kid, but I think that I knew then, way back then, how good it was to have sex. After being in your bed for a while, it was pretty hot having you on top of me and watching you with her."</p> <p>"Have you ever done it with a woman before?"</p> <p>"Of course. That's one of my weaknesses. It's like having a wild animal that knows when you're going to be ready to put something in between your legs. For me, a woman is really into it and I always seem to find it a bit of a turn-on. You and she are so different that she always feels like she has to touch me first. It doesn't matter if she is your girlfriend, you might as well take advantage of that. But she has to feel the real thing, and that's what a woman has to do if she wants to be with you."</p> <p>"I think that this is hard for you to understand, and I like it, if you know what I mean," I said.</p> <p>It was only a few minutes, but I knew it would be soon. I had never been able to be with anyone this much before. It seemed like every time she came along, I was ready at the touch of her, I would move closer, but she was nowhere nearby.</p> <p>We talked a bit about me going to college and then I saw that my stomach was a bit flat, and I was afraid. My thoughts were more of that, "Have you found someone as wonderful as that little redhead?" Then my thoughts became more of a dream as I thought of what I had just done.</p> <p>"Did you feel anything at all that I did to you? I do hope you will make love to me again," she said leaning back on her chair.</p> <p>"You don't really want to have sex with meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
