You make me feel that way too."</p> <p>She looked a bit embarrassed. I think she knew how I felt about that.</p> <p>"I love you," she said. "And I really do feel like I loved you too. It's not that I don't have a thing, it's just that I didn't think I do," I said.</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"It's ok, Jack. I love you anyway, but..."</p> <p>"But what, Sam?"</p> <p>"You know what I love about you. You've always been there for me, always with me. That's not the kind of love you and Jenny are talking about."</p> <p>"You always have been there, Jack. That's one big difference between us right now. You and Jenny are here instead."</p> <p>"So what, Sam?"</p> <p>There was a bit of a pause as she thought about this, and I could almost hear that she was wondering if I wanted to hear it all.</p> <p>"It's a girl thing," I said. "I loved my mother. I always have. It was hard because she was always like that. I know, I think she was always just like my mommy. I mean, it really isn't too hard to love, is it?"</p> <p>I thought that had the same effect on Samantha that just a few hours ago. She was like a shell.</p> <p>"It can never be too much, Jack," she said. "I know you said it was love and I was just glad to say it, that was all it took. Now, you're right, it could be great, but I'd be happy if it never was."</p> <p>"I'm glad this is all so sudden, Sam" I said.</p> <p>She smiled again.</p> <p>"Yeah, you're sure it is. We love each other, Jack"</p> <p>"Maybe it's the only way to keep this secret."</p> <p>The look in her eyes gave away what she was thinking.</p> <p>"No," she said slowly. "I love you too, Jack. There's a difference between us and I just know it."</p> <p>And she said it with that expression of love and compassion.</p> <p>"It's the same as before, Sam" I said. "But the truth is, we're not all that close, are we, Sam?"</p> <p>She smiled at me again.</p> <p>"Not any more than I originally planned, Jack. You're the most important part of me," she said, and held my hand again.</p> <p>"And I've loved you, too, Sam"</p> <p>She smiled again.</p> <p>"A lot," she said.</p> <p>"Not just with you, Sam. I've loved you a lot," I said.</p> <p>"Do you think I'll get to get my father," she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know what I'd call it," I said. "I don't want to say anymore right now. It wouldn't be right for me to say anything until I've had a chance to have a chance to talk to him first about what happened."</p> <p>"But he'll be here tonight," Sam said. "His folks are still here so we won't see them much."</p> <p>We went to sleep. She made love to me again in the morning, and I got up in the afternoon to go to work.</p> <p>I went to work.</p> <p>Sam came over to the hospital at my work in the afternoon. She seemed relieved to see me, and then a bit sad. She walked over to me and started kissing me on neck very softly, like she was trying to make my skin feel as soft and affectionate. She looked up at me with those wide lopsided, innocent eyes, and said,</p> <p>"I love you, Sam"</p> <p>"I love you too, Jack."</p> <p>My dick was hard for a second before she realized that. She put me back into work and we started the day together, and as Sam went home to spend her night there, I headed home to take care of my girl, Sam.</p> <p>She came home a few minutes before I did. She went through the motions. She came into the kitchen and stood where she had been a minute or two ago. Her eyes were a warm blue, and just a bit misty, as if she'd just been inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
