I'll leave that one today and put it in a box. I'll then give you a ride home. I'll be by on the way home. And then it will be time for you to give your gift. You know I've had your back to me all along."</p> <p>"But... But... I haven't..."</p> <p>"No buts. You haven't had my back," and from the back he went and opened her front room door. "I have all my things. I got them all for you. You have not been given gifts in the house."</p> <p>"But why?"</p> <p>"You'll be at home tomorrow."</p> <p>"But... I... I wanted to watch you take the shower today."</p> <p>"That must have been bad. I hope it didn't happen before it happened. You're all I'll be showing off today."</p> <p>"Maybe you can see it in your eyes."</p> <p>She closed the door and turned to the dresser. Pulling it open she saw the box. Lying on the bed was a gold anklet with a large diamond charm embossed in blue and pink and looking so inviting and so wicked that it drew his interest and lust in ways he never imagined! A matching garter belt and thigh high stockings were the only things in the box.</p> <p>"That's nice. Thank you." She took the box and sat on the edge of the bed looking it up and down. "There, now I see what you have done to my husband."</p> <p>Sasha was so embarrassed that the collar was making her blush! "Why do you make such a fuss? I mean, you're not supposed to be walking around like this!" She stood and went to her dresser. There were more things in that box.</p> <p>"Here you are. Remember how I like to make you feel special for just a few minutes?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she said in a breathy tone. With that, she reached in and pulled the collar of the collar out. "But first, I have something new for you." She held out the collar to him. "I think it's for you."</p> <p>"Oh." He looked at the collar and then back her. "But it seems nice?"</p> <p>"Well what are you going to tell me? Are you going to do it for me or for your husband are you?"</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry. First of all I want to make you happy and then I would like you to have a very special gift for me."</p> <p>The collar, necklace and bracelet were so enticing. He would buy them a hundred thousand dollars to look like the best of all those things. He would do anything she wanted for her. She had her hand on his head and looked down at his lap. She pulled him back upright and then stepped off the bed. She sat in front of him before she could get the collar on and slipped it on. It fitted him perfectly and then she did something he had always wanted. She had slipped the neckline just below her nipples, as well as underneath.</p> <p>"Come on. You can put on the necklace. Put you hair up on your head this," and she did so that the collar was now attached to the collar. It was a long sleeve gold chain. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He did what she asked and it was such an erotic sight. "Come on now. Don't take it off. It's all for you. You know how much you love it on and off?"</p> <p>He nodded. Then he did put the necklace around his neck and attached the necklace to the clasp. He held the front of the collar there between his lips. Sasha turned and put her arms around his neck. She kissed him softly. "You're very special. Thank you." Then she released his neck. She had been looking forward to seeing how many gifts would come, but now she was going to have to make it wait. She smiled up at him. "Come on now and get ready," she said in such a soft and seductive voice.</p> <p>He sat and she knelt in front of him. She unbuttoned his pants and pulled his pants and boxers down. She wrapped her small hand around her arms behind his legs just inches away from his crotch. She reached into his shorts and pulled out what appeared to be a beautiful cock. The cock was so hard that it actually had no need to be. She reached up his legs and pulled his underwear out too. She then turned her head slightly over his crotch, and then back to where she started. She licked the tip of the cock as her hand kept it up and over the base. She put the tip in her mouth and took it into her mouth all the way.
