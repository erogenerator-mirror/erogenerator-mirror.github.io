He lifted me up the final stairs before falling us onto his bed. I sat next to him and he lay down on top of me and kissed me. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and pulled him down with me so he would be able to lay with me. We kissed and rolled around on the bed, I loved the feel of his hands on me.</p> <p>"God you feel so good inside me, lover." I whispered to him as I rolled onto my back again, wrapping my legs around him and pulling him in with my arms.</p> <p>"I love you so much." He said as we lay there quietly kissing again.</p> <p>"I know, baby. It only makes this better." I replied as I turned over onto my back, facing him and then pulling him closer so that his face was next to mine. "I'll never forget how good it felt to be inside you." He said as he kissed me.</p> <p>"Me neither." I replied as he continued to kiss me with his hands roaming down my body, over my bum and teasing my pussy while continuing down to my legs to caress my thighs and my toes, slowly pulling myself closer to him. I was so sexually aroused and had to have more control of my body. I pulled him down and kissed the back of his head as I placed a hand on his thigh, stopping him. "We don't have to. I want you to fuck me. Please baby." I said softly trying to reassure him once again.</p> <p>"There are enough guys, as you know." He said as he started kissing my neck lightly and stroking my back, shoulders and the insides of my arms. It felt so good to have him in my arms again, even if we did say no.</p> <p>"Yes you will." I replied to him and ran my fingertip down his chest to his stomach before pushing my body into his and wrapping my arms around his head. "Lover, I've missed having you there the past six months." I whispered as I slid my tongue over his lips and ran my fingernails along his shoulders, down his arms and across his fingers.</p> <p>"You missed me too." He replied in a dreamy way. We rolled our bodies together so that we were spooning under the covers when he kissed me, pulling me closer to him. I closed my eyes and opened my legs a little wider for him, he pulled them up until he was up slightly under my arm. He started to stroke my legs and ran one hand up and down my thigh before pulling me closer so that I could wrap my legs around his hips and get him to rub my clit with his stomach just so he could feel the softness of my body.</p> <p>"I've missed this." He kissed my face as he fingered me to a fever pitch. "I can't believe how fucking horny I've been ever since we came in to check on us. I could stay up all night, dreaming of your body, knowing that we were going to fuck." He said as he kissed me on my neck.</p> <p>"You're my lover, baby. I love you so much. I have no doubts about what makes me hot and wet. You have no idea." I replied as I ran my finger across his face to make him smile at me.</p> <p>"You're going to make me hot and wet, by making love to your body." He said as his lips made their way down my chest to suck my nipples while fingering and lightly kissing my pussy, causing me to grind my body against his. I turned one of my legs over so that I was straddling him, giving him better access. He wrapped his arms around me and he kissed me again.</p> <p>"Make love to me, my lover." I whispered to him and pulled him closer. "We'll never be as happy as we are right now." I teased him as I kissed his neck.</p> <p>I pushed him off of me so I could feel of his cock as I slid down the length of his body, kissing my way down his chest, he took me by the shoulders and lifted me up so that I was on my knees, resting my thighs on his hips. He spread his legs and I could feel his huge cock rubbing against my wet pussy, making me push back against it as he grabbed my ass and began to gently fuck me.</p> <p>"God it feels so good, baby!" I exclaimed as I arched my back, pushing back against him. He was slowly driving himself against me as he kissed my neck. He reached forward and grabbed my nipple and rolled it between his thumb and forefinger before bringing them up to my mouth so that Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
