"I've got a new boyfriend, and I can't seem to get him in the right spots. You'll love it!" she said.</p> <p>Nurse Suckled. "If you're going to come with me you'll be more than welcome."</p> <p>Her voice was a little shaky; it was a mix of nerves, excitement, and the usual buzz. But the girl had told her what was going to happen and she was going to do it.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "I'll listen. Do you mind coming in?"</p> <p>Nurse Suckled. "Okay," she said again, and quickly shut the door.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Suckling. "We're taking a shower. I brought enough towels. Go in the bathroom first."</p> <p>Suckling. "Go in here first and take off everything."</p> <p>Dumbstruck.</p> <p>"But I'm a virgin!" she whispered loudly as Nurse Suckled turned on a shower, pulled down her puckered white panties and stepped under the current stream of water. She let the hot water do the work but a tiny voice was screaming from somewhere deep inside her, a voice that had not been uttered before. The voices belonged to someone else. Something in her brain. And there was fear in it that it was going to hurt. Something like this had always frightened her at her age. There had been a time when she'd been frightened of being rejected by anyone when she was first with her school friend. Now there had been fear. Now it was fear at being rejected. With a sense of dread it was there. There was an awful lot of it being said between people and it wouldn't take long to build up. And yet she was so wet that it was almost felt to be going in the shower with her. As though she were going to take this much pounding on her bare back or her naked breasts. And the water would be a constant reminder that she'd been there. Her body had been used. Her body would be used for whatever pleasure it sought. And it was going to have some fun today. But it wasn't something that she was ready to participate in. She wanted to be able to give her body the pleasure it deserved. She wanted to be so good she was willing to do it.</p> <p>As she watched Nurse Suckler's eyes bore into her, her mind was a flurry of thoughts and questions. She was sure they were going to go through with it. It had been over a year since she'd been with anyone and she didn't know what to expect. She wasn't sure whether she would be doing anything with her hands. She wasn't sure if she'd be doing anything with herself. She only knew that she'd made the decision. She'd taken it. In fact, she'd almost done it. And somehow the thought had made her feel better. She looked between her legs at the pink swollen lips that glistened in the candlelight and imagined how it would feel if she spread it wide open and slid her fingers into her slit and played with herself. With the water beating down on her face she opened her legs just an inch. And she took two fingers. Her hand was trembling. And she moaned when she made the slick wet spot that her fingers had come to find wetness in minutes before. She brought herself to the edge of orgasm in quick motions.</p> <p>The thought had come. What it would be like to be this good for someone else. To be made to come. To be wanted. To please. To be in this state in front of Nurse Suckler. Who would know? And what would she do when she found out? Would she do it by himself? Would she be the first? Would she be the first for her? What would it be like for her? How would she feel? How would it go with her? She had been so sure she would do something in those first days of her life but something had seemed to give a little over the course of those next few days. She had thought that she would be the perfect companion for someone in any situation but something had suddenly appeared and seemed to take her by surprise. And when he'd left she'd never suspected what this experience might be like. She had felt alone and used but now she found that she was not alone. There were others. And she couldn't seem to stand it anymore. The girl was getting closer. She was coming too.</p> <p>"Here," Suckling said. "Let me help you." She turned the water off and picked a few of the towels down from the shower rack and handed them to Nurse Suckler. They were used for just about all of the bathroom things and it was a little awkward to strip off them in the steamy shower.
