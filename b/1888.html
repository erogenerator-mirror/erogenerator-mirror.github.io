After several minutes, he started back to her face and lips, and slowly began to kiss her. Their lips pressed together sensually, her hands caressing his shoulders, upper arms, and hands. Her breathing gradually slackened, her lips returned to the soft, wet, kiss before them, and they continued their journey downward toward her thighs. The kissing progressed to the tops of her feet, and then lower legs. She slowly opened her thighs, letting his hands roam across her body and then around to each side of her and slowly and seductively stroked her inner thighs as she continued kissing him. He leaned sideways to kiss each other's face, neck, ears, and upper lobes. His hands continued to softly massage the other's body, and his warm lips moved lower. When he reached the center of her lower stomach, he slowly spread the flesh at the top of her groin so that his warm breath could caress and tease her clitoris. She moaned deeply at this and was obviously enjoying the attention; her eyes were closed and she was clearly enjoying the pleasure his ministrations were giving her. His thumbs gradually stroked her labia, as if they were silk cushions. Their hands continued to move against each other's body, and they made soft moaning sounds of pleasure. His tongue explored her lips, and soon was between her lips, sliding in and out over her clitoris. He continued his assault on her, and began a series of long, deep, sensual licks that soon had her panting. Their bodies had become rigid and straining in anticipation, though not at their desire to be in the position to make them cum at that moment. Forcing her legs apart, the head of his penis came into contact with her vagina, and he could sense her nervousness so easily because he could feel her tension, too. He could also feel the slight wetness of her lips as they parted, and he could feel the heat of her arousal. He slid the tip of his tongue slowly and gently into her opening as he brought it up to her clitoris.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she groaned in a throaty whisper, "Oh, yes. More."</p> <p>With that little statement, she came for the third time, and her eyes went wide as they glazed over with a kind of ecstasy. Her hands clutched his head and pulled him up to hers. This time, he gently placed his penis between her lips, then slowly began to move in and out. She could feel his erection pressing against her, and she felt so wet. She brought his hand down to her crotch and began to slowly stroke him in rhythm with his thrusts.</p> <p>"Oh...yeah", she said as her breathing began to speed.</p> <p>"Do me like this...that way...do my cock into your mouth...do my cock into your pretty mouth...yes...do my cock-shaft into your pretty mouth. Can you take all of me in?"</p> <p>He held her head and fucked her mouth for several moments in this way, moving his cock in and out of her lips, mouth and tongue. His lips and face formed the same motion as his cock, in rhythm with his thrusts into her body. She could feel the heat of his body on hers, and could also feel the warmth of his cock. She could tell when he started to increase his strokes, and felt herself on the brink of orgasm again. "Yes...cum for me" she whispered. She could feel him go as deep as possible into her mouth, and felt his body tighten inside of her. He then continued his pace of moving his penis between her lips. He held her head firmly; his cock continued to pump into her as he began to twitch several times. Finally he pulled out with a gasp, and turned her head so that he could kiss her. As he kissed her, again she felt her legs tremble. He began to rub his penis on her cheek, then slowly moved it around her face to coat her with her own juices. Her eyes were closed, and his lips touched hers. The kiss lasted for several minutes, as he ran his tongue along her lips and into her mouth. He placed his hand on the back of her head, and ran his fingers through her hair as he continued to rub her clit and probe her vagina.</p> <p>"What did you do to your pussy", he moaned.</p> <p>"I sucked your cock", she replied. "Do you mind? It felt so good in my mouth" she said dreamily. "Your cock felt so good in my pussy, too", she said, between deep breaths. She was enjoying this as much as he was.</p> <p>She moved away from his embrace. "I guess I better get back to my work", she said, as she walked back towardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
