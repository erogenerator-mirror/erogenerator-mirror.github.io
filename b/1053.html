"But that doesn't mean you can't ask me for something, do it, take what you want as long as you want, that's the whole deal.</p> <p>"There are things you can't do if you really want to," I said. "I know, you've already told me this all the time.</p> <p>"Yes, but I've let some people know that already."</p> <p>"So you're going to keep them a secret." I said.</p> <p>"Of course," she said. "Now please lie back."</p> <p>I lied on the desk. "You don't want my advice?"</p> <p>"No, I mean you don't, but you can. And you know how I feel about it, I don't want to just lie here to do you proud again."</p> <p>I didn't care that she'd been waiting for the next set of instructions. I'd told her all the time that everything had to be fun. I wasn't about to tell her anything else.</p> <p>She took off her shirt. Her breasts weren't huge, but they were perky and nice. I stared as she reached around her back to unhook her bra. "You like looking at me, don't you?"</p> <p>She didn't answer, but just nodded.</p> <p>She unclasped her bra and threw it off onto the armchair. Her breasts were a little bigger than mine, but not a lot. They'd still be as full as they were as soon as I said I liked my breasts. I cupped my breasts, feeling it rising and falling with my every beat as I played with my nipples.</p> <p>"Do you like the feel of them?" she said.</p> <p>"Y-yes," I said, "a lot."</p> <p>I lifted her breasts up from her back, cupping them in my hands. They were a little lighter than mine, I guess. They also looked a tad bigger than mine, which made my mind go a bit crazy.</p> <p>I leaned down to kiss her belly button, then took a kiss right on her lips.</p> <p>She was still breathing deeply and slowly, like she hadn't just had the most amazing orgasm yet.</p> <p>She didn't resist me at all. "Good," she said, "you're doing fine. Are you going to be my slave again before you're even half a man?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure," I said. "I've got things to do, we're getting back."</p> <p>"So am I."</p> <p>I didn't go any further. I'd had to talk with her some last night, and we both knew that there was no way we were going to do anything further that I couldn't do myself. And she certainly knew that, and in the end, it was a pleasure for me. I knew what she told me would make me feel good, and I didn't mind that she knew.</p> <p>As soon as I put my arms around her chest, my lips found her breasts. I kissed and nipped at them, trying to figure out which way they'd make her feel. I couldn't quite work out how far they'd go. She let go of my breast and lay back onto the desk, putting her arms up over her head.</p> <p>When I got to her nipples, she said "You can touch them."</p> <p>"Are there limits?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "Anything I'd say."</p> <p>And she meant anything.</p> <p>My hand went to her other breast. While I kissed her there, my fingers wandered right over her nipple. She moaned.</p> <p>I kissed further down her body and worked my hand down over her mound to get at her lips. I kissed and licked her again before I worked my way down to her clitoris. Even though she hadn't told me that I couldn't use my other hand, I could feel her body vibrating. If I could do this with my mouth and hands, I'd be doing this all afternoon and never hear her again.</p> <p>When I worked my way back up her body, I felt how wet she was. "Now your ass," she said, "here." So, I turned and got my hands underneath of myself, pushing both my hands together. I felt her fingers spread out, and then the tip of my penis pushing at her opening. I wasn't able to fit in her properly, but I managed to start pushing inside of her as she opened her thighs even wider for me. I wasn't ready to try to slide in right away, though, and she put up her hands to stop me.</p> <p>"No, wait." Not yet. I was halfway in.</p> <p>"Please," she said, â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
