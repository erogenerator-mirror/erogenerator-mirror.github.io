He took in her small breasts, her small waist, and her small but rounded hips.</p> <p>"Maybe," she said softly. Their lips met.</p> <p>"I think that's all you really need to know," he whispered, as he pulled her close to him.</p> <p>"Hmm... I'm not sure I can wait around another day, after the baby." She turned her face back and kissed him, "I'll be thinking about you forever," she told him, "I love you, Rob. I need some time to look over what happened, before I decide I don't want the same." She looked at the clock. "It's about time!"</p> <p>"Well, you can go take a quick shower, and use my phone." He winked at her, then pulled her close, and kissed her again. "I'll be right there," he said, and walked over to the bed, where she was laying on her back, and asked, "What would you like to do now?"</p> <p>"Well, I do have a question for you."</p> <p>"Anything," he said, pulling away and sitting down on one of his knees next to her. He pulled her to him and kissed her deeply. "I guess I'd like to know... did I ever..."</p> <p>"It's OK baby, you don't have to answer that," she told him. He pulled her close and licked her neck, sending shivers down her spine, "It feels good," she told him, "but I just... you're so... beautiful..." He moved down to her breasts, giving them a thorough licking and sucking. She reached down and caressed his bulge while he kissed her nipples, and she moaned, "Rob, I don't know if I want to do something now that I'm really sore," she moaned, taking his hand.</p> <p>He felt her shiver as his finger traced the ridges of her pussy, "Well, I haven't been with anyone else since we came home," he admitted. She smiled.</p> <p>"So, you think I'm sexy?" she asked. "Oh yes. You're sexiest," he replied, "And it's going to be a long time before I'm able to do it right," he explained.</p> <p>She moved forward on the bed, giving him a passionate kiss, "I want you to know... I want us to be together."</p> <p>"Aww... you've got me... " he stammered.</p> <p>"Aww... I know... " she whispered.</p> <p>"I know I don't know if I can really do it, but, I do have a request for you." The look on his face told her he was serious; it took her a moment to realize what he was asking about. She got on her knees and looked up at him. "You want to be with me?" she asked. She sat naked on the edge of the bed, which he noticed was wet, and asked, "Is that what this is about?"</p> <p>"I'm telling you, I don't want anything to do with you, at all," he told her.</p> <p>"Don't say that, baby. I told you I don't want you to know my secret!" As he spoke, her hands ran across his stomach and down to his crotch. It was obvious that he was excited. "Now you have to answer my question. Do I want to be with you? Do you want me with you?" she asked, sitting down again beside him.</p> <p>"If that's what you want, I'm not going to refuse that request." He moved her onto her back. "Lay on your back." His tongue darted over the nipple. She gasped as it swelled to his touch, and her eyes flew open.</p> <p>"Rob, what are you... doing?" he questioned, as his tongue flicked over her areola, sending ripples down to her pussy. Her hand began stroking his dick, which was hardening to her touch. She moved slowly as she listened. "I don't want this!" she whispered, "I want you to be with me!"</p> <p>"OK, let's try something different," he said, kneeling between her legs, "do you want me to tell you what to do?" She watched his big eyes as they looked down at her, "OK," he said. "You just lay there and watch me... oh and there we go..." His tongue snaked out and ran up and down her pussy. "Oh yeah, that's perfect," he sighed, "I love you, you beautiful, sexy..." he said, "oh, this is going so well." She was starting to feel a tingling between her legsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
