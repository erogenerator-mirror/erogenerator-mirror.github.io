"This is a 'fantasy,' nothing more. It's how you've made me feel about a whole lot of things and how I've made you feel when you were close to me..."</p> <p>After some awkward pause between them, Jana finished the drink and looked down into her soda glass. "So what about this stuff that's really fun?" she asked.</p> <p>"Don't," I told her. "You know that, right?"</p> <p>"Well, yes, but I'm not in love with it."</p> <p>I nodded. "Yeah, you're a good person. So I wouldn't change that if it weren't for you and me. No, I don't think that's a good idea." I knew exactly what made me feel good. I just didn't know it then. But now, now, I wanted to go further with the plan. The problem was that I didn't know how. When I got to her apartment, I decided to go straight up to bed and see about turning over.</p> <p>"You'd better try to sleep for a while..." I told her. "Before anything else," I said pointing to her bedside table. "I won't lie to you."</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"Goodnight," I whispered, kissing her head on her cheek.</p> <p>"Goodnight," she whispered back.</p> <p>I leaned over her and kissed her, lingering for a few seconds to brush her breasts, which got my little dick hard again.</p> <p>She didn't seem bothered by it, so I kissed her neck and ear as I walked up her hallway towards her bedroom and closed her door. I walked inside and locked the door, as I always do every night, and sat down on her bed. I crossed my legs and waited until I heard her go in.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" I wondered aloud, getting ready for something that wasn't. She said nothing other than snickering.</p> <p>I was a little disappointed until I realized why she did that. At least I knew she was not in love with it. So the two things I couldn't possibly count on were a few very stupid words and actions from her that wouldn't make a difference.</p> <p>As I lay there mulling over all those ridiculous things, I got more aroused and tried to remember one of my favourite pastimes. "I thought you said I was going to find the right man to spend the night with?" I said.</p> <p>"I would, but... well... I wasn't feeling up to a night alone, and since what happens after midnight doesn't..." she hesitated.</p> <p>"What would you like to happen?" I asked.</p> <p>"I was thinking maybe..." she paused, realizing she wasn't going to say for sure anything, but she was still wondering about something.</p> <p>"Maybe that's it?" I asked. "Maybe I should go ahead and find a man willing to do the same thing that I did. Or maybe the guy won't make me so crazy?" Then I added, "Maybe someone is a fucking bastard, you know?"</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>I laughed. "Well, you're right. That's the thing though. But that's not what I meant. I mean, I'm sure there's a guy out there with a cock to match it, but only I know how a true man acts."</p> <p>She smiled. "Well, no you're not, but I sure as hell am. And the guy's only got one."</p> <p>Then she stopped smiling and started staring at the floor. I was stunned and didn't know what to do. I just sat there in dumbfounded amazement.</p> <p>After a few seconds she finally looked over at me. "So, is he good at that?" she finally asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I finally responded.</p> <p>"You have anything coming up?" she asked me then.</p> <p>"Maybe..." I hesitated again.</p> <p>"No, no, wait. I'm just thinking... maybe..." she finally stopped again.</p> <p>She turned and looked at my face, waiting for me to make the first decision. I was about to ask her one more thing, but for some reason I couldn't.</p> <p>"I'm not very good at blowjobs," I finally said.</p> <p>"Why don't you ask me something?" she teased.</p> <p>"Because if I did, I wouldn't know" I teased back.</p> <p>I got up to turn out the light and she told me to get up first. She got up too and sat down on the bed. It felt odd to be in her room with this strange woman sitting there.</p> <p>"So, youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
