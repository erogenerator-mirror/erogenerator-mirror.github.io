I chuckled.</p> <p>"Mmm hm," she hummed, "I have learned everything there is to know about our lifestyle." She looked over at her husband with a sad expression but then she smiled. He smiled back at her.</p> <p>"How much do you want to share," he asked. She smiled sweetly and said, "I can only give everything I have right now, I can only do it here." She was nodding as she continued "I could never have any other secrets from you and I am so happy for you."</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed her husband and then said, "I love you." She held him tightly and they kissed long and deep and with her tongue deep into his mouth.</p> <p>"I love you too," he said.</p> <p>"Oh, now we need to go take a shower," she joked. She looked at me and shrugged. I shook my head.</p> <p>We dressed and as we walked out back to the shower, I smiled at how hot my girlfriend was and how much fun I had been to find out about her sex life with Steve. She was so sweet and loving. She did everything we told her to do.</p> <p>We took the four suitcases into the guest bedroom and put them down on the kitchen table and then put down the rest of the suits. I had already laid our bags and towels on the king sized bed and we all climbed into the shower. We embraced as the water ran down our bodies. She was rubbing soap all over me as I washed her and soaped her too.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes," she said with a sexy smile. "It's nice getting soap on you while you're doing it. Does this feel nice?" She asked as she reached for and soaped my cock again.</p> <p>"Ah, it feels more like what I remember it feeling when you took me so gently," I said</p> <p>"I liked that," Sara said.</p> <p>"I sure did," I said.</p> <p>"You have a nice cock, too," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"I think I like it too, Sara. I like it when you take your time on me," I answered before she could answer.</p> <p>"We'll have plenty of time," she said. She gave my dick another rub and I knew she could feel my hard prick rubbing against the shower wall. "Let's get out of the shower and get dressed." She turned off the shower and stepped out.</p> <p>We turned on the lights and dried ourselves. She pulled on a silk gown and I made a note to buy two suits as we went out for dinner. She made spaghetti, we had salad for dinner and a glass of wine. I wore a pair of slinky slacks and blouse, she made sure to wear something sexy and very high cut that showed off her bustline. After dinner we went for our walk. She grabbed something to wear that she had brought to wear for the walk and followed me outside.</p> <p>"You look as hot as you do now," I said, "you look hot."</p> <p>She smiled and nodded "Oh, don't you get it. You look so sexy. Now we can just leave it in here."</p> <p>"Let's go put it on. I like the way it looks on you."</p> <p>"Me too," I smiled. "Let's see if this suit looks good." I picked up her things and helped her take them inside. She smiled as I handed her her jacket and tie. I got the bag we'd been using because I wanted to show her what she had to put on later. She smiled and shook her head.</p> <p>"We can't stay here. Besides I think my tits would be a lot easier to see in the outfit I chose." She grinned and handed me the top. "Oh, yeah, let's go get changed," she said, "I'll be right back." She took the jacket and I held it so it pulled open easily. I held it up and pulled it closed as she came around the back of my bike. I pulled the top closed and she stepped back in. She took the jacket off and we walked back inside.</p> <p>"I don't think we need to go," I said.</p> <p>"No, we don't need to do that. I think you're perfect. You look so sexy."</p> <p>I put my arm around her waist and she held onto my arm as we walked to our suite. Inside, we took the rest of the clothes we'd been putting on and put them down. It was a simple affair. A sheer pink top that just barely covered her breasts, a short plaid skirt and heels. She put her jacket on and we went back inside. She put the jacket on in front and I putâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
