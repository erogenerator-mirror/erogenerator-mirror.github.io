I cried out as you came home.</p> <p>"Darling, sweetie, please forgive me," you murmured as you lifted me back in your arms and carried me to the bedroom in a rush.</p> <p>As I lay back, you looked deep into my eyes with a dreamy gaze, and I could feel your arms around me once, then again. I opened my eyes and held them open as you laid me back on the bed, and I turned my face to your breasts.</p> <p>"We really do need," you murmured, "this isn't the first time we've been together since last Sunday," your hand reached out and stroked my erection between your soft fleshy thighs. You smiled as it reached its first erection.</p> <p>I reached down and held your legs, "Let me take that virginity away," I whispered as you looked at me dreamingly. I smiled as you reached out to me, "please?"</p> <p>"You can take off the rest of my clothes," I whispered, "but, I'd kind of like to lay out."</p> <p>"Of course," you agreed, and you gently lowered yourself onto me.</p> <p>The feeling was indescribably wonderful as our flesh met and the excitement was like an electric current, and I lay back with your legs still around me.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, that's so lovely," you moaned as I began to move my hips up and down, and we were so close, no-one could help in. The tension we had both been holding out for, that was all gone.</p> <p>I groaned when I felt your pussy tighten around me. I reached my arms round your back and began to move, and as you began to writhe in ecstasy, I reached to your bum and began to gently stroke your inner part. The more excited you got, the more sensitive your body. It took only moments before you began to come.</p> <p>"Oh God, baby, I never thought I could come that way, that's wonderful."</p> <p>"Yes it is!" I replied, and I moved my hips, making sure your pussy wasn't too tight, and let it move all the way up and down my shaft.</p> <p>"This is so wonderful, it's as if I'm never going to stop!" you moaned.</p> <p>We lay there for a few glorious minutes, and you gently caressed my face. I lifted mine to yours and touched your hair, and we began to kiss again. As we lay there, I reached around and caressed your tits, and your nipple just peeked out at me. We kissed and caressed a while, and we didn't stop until just as we were about to drift off to sleep, you broke the kiss and looked down at me.</p> <p>"I loved you doing that to me too," you murmured.</p> <p>"How long?" I managed to ask.</p> <p>"Well, now and again, but it's not always this time," you groaned.</p> <p>"Oh, yes it is," I agreed, "and I love you doing that for me too, all of your body as if you're never going to want to stop."</p> <p>You smiled, "I love it when you can make me come, but, after you, we'll have to do it a lot, won't we?" With that, your pussy became still tighter as your climax came on.</p> <p>After a long time of being joined together, we got up, and we put on robes as we went upstairs that evening. As we were going off to our respective rooms, you came into the room, and paused to take in the way I was lying on the bed, legs akimbo, your robe open and your breasts exposed.</p> <p>"Your room, my room," I said.</p> <p>"I can't promise that it won't get any better," you murmured as your mouth found mine, "but, we'll see."</p> <p>I couldn't say anything but I kissed you anyway, for you had never gone that far before. And I knew you wouldn't just leave me to die.</p> <p>We went to bed quickly in the morning, and as we did, I thought I was going to wake you up. I didn't get to see the expression on your face as I got out of bed, because of the robe! It was so long ago that I could almost remember it when I was a teenager! "What!" you moaned.</p> <p>"The robe is too tight—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
