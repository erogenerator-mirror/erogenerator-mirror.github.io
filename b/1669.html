I guess having her in my bed with me was more than I could take. She started grinding her pelvis against me and I was almost overwhelmed with a passion I had never before felt. We fucked each other like there was no tomorrow. She reached for me and it took all I could muster to stand up. I held on to her tight as hard as I could to keep her in my grasp. She seemed to feel that too and I looked over to find her smiling at me. She was flushed and breathing hard but held on to me by the waist. Her whole body was flush with emotion and I wanted her forever.</p> <p>"I want this. I want you," I answered.</p> <p>My answer must have communicated to her that I had no resistance. She took both my hands and placed them on her shoulders. She tilted my face upwards with a knowing look in her eyes. The look was so beautiful. I could not have hoped for more to this moment. I started to kiss her neck and she responded to me in kind. I moved her hair aside to lick and suck on my way down her neck, to her shoulders and further down her arms to her hands. Her skin smelled like flowers and I inhaled the scent deeply. I started to kiss and nibble her on both nipples. They were already hard and poking at her. I could see them on the small swell of her breasts and there was no doubt she was wet.</p> <p>I moved back up her body until I was facing her chest. I kissed her chest at the top of her breasts before taking one nipple into my mouth. I flicked it a few times and found it firm. She let out a little yelp and tried to get a better hold on me. I moved my mouth and sucked on her nipple again. Her hands were on the back of my head but not pressing. I moved to the other one and started to suck on it too. Soon she was mewing with pleasure.</p> <p>I moved back down her body and kissed her skin. I left my hair trail on her stomach until I got to her pussy. There was not much hair on her that I could see. I moved her leg up and kissed her inner thigh. She moved towards me and started to run her fingers over my face. I moved closer to her and she kissed me on the mouth. I held on to her waist to keep my balance as I licked her. She took my tongue in her mouth and started to moan. I was feeling a rush of excitement at the touch of her lips. I moved even closer to her and I kissed her again. She turned into me and we kissed. Her body was trembling as she returned my kiss.</p> <p>She opened her mouth and let me kiss her soft lips. I started sucking on them a little and we kissed a longer than normal. I moved my hands to her body. I touched her as a butterfly and I moved closer to her. My chest touched hers. I could feel the nipples stiffening up. I moved my lips nearer to hers. I was trying to lick back and forth between her mouth and her lips. She moved to meet my kiss. My desire to kiss her was growing. Our tongues met and explored each other. My hands moved to her ass. I squeezed her and I felt her body move in response. I could feel her breast move with my touch and I could tell by her sounds that she was becoming excited. I moved my mouth towards her neck and kissed her there, I sucked on her skin. I moved further down to her breast and I could smell the aroma of aroused female. I felt her hand on my head move down and take each of my hands in hers.</p> <p>"Take off your shirt," I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>I was nervous as was she but I did remove my shirt. She took the garment off and I stood naked in front of her naked. She turned her face to look at my face and then I kissed her. It was passionate as if I was going to French kiss her, but I moved to kiss her shoulder. I moved back and she took off my shirt. Her hand ran over my stomach slowly and she traced it up to my neck. I felt both her hands on my stomach. They were soft and it felt delightful. I started to kiss her and she was returning my kiss. She guided my hand over her breast and my fingers found the nipple. I could not believe it but I started to circle around it and it sent shock waves of sensations through me like I had never experienced before. She slowly got up and straddled me. Our bodies fit perfectly in the space between her legs. She looked at me and slowly moved her arms down my body and started to kiss my lips and neck. There was a small gap between her lips and her upper body. Her lips seemed to travel all over my neck.</p> <p>Her lips moved close enough forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
