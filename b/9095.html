"It doesn't stop there, either," I added, "though his cock may still be stiff and eager for me."</p> <p>"Oh my, yes, I am so wet. Yes, I'm enjoying this," she moaned, wriggling around with my hand still there. "But I'm so nervous, too. Will you be too?" she asked, turning in my arms so that we were about chest to chest and our lips were just touching.</p> <p>"Yes, you're probably right. Don't worry. It's only a fantasy, that's not real," I told her. "As long as you're ready to experience what being my first time is like, and you'll like it, I assure you, I'll be OK."</p> <p>"That's true, it's just that I'm nervous. Will you at least make me cum?" she asked me. I knew she was serious but I nodded in the affirmative, knowing I would be in for a ride from both of them.</p> <p>"OK, but I think I need you now," she said, reaching back to unbuckle my pants and taking them off.</p> <p>"Well, maybe you will," I replied after she had my jeans and underwear off. "But you'll have to let me," I added as I knelt down, my tongue flicking in between her parted legs and then diving back down.</p> <p>When I licked her up and down for the umpteenth or fifth time, she shuddered, her hips humping against me. I didn't take my time with her, though. I kept right on licking, enjoying the flavor of her, feeling her, hearing her, feeling her, touching her, tasting her. And then, I did what I wanted to do with her, just licking and then, sucking and then her legs. She didn't complain, just kept humping her hips so I could eat her out even more. It didn't take long before she was ready to cum and she squirted, just the way she did on my face, her juices coating my chin and mouth, and dripping down my stomach onto my briefs.</p> <p>While she came, her legs fell to the bed, her feet flat on the carpet. I got myself comfortable on one side of her, my hands gently caressing her legs to ensure she would not fall, not to push her off, and she didn't. She reached up to pull her knees up and lifted her thighs so I could kiss and kiss her as she gasped for air.</p> <p>"Honey," she whimpered, "this is not about my orgasm."</p> <p>"Oh yes it is," I answered, "but this is about having this little surprise."</p> <p>"And what would that be?" she asked as she pulled on my boxer shorts.</p> <p>"Come here and see," I told her. I helped her to the bed and then had her roll over so I could see her ass better. When I looked back at her, I realized I was naked, my cock and balls exposed, right there under her. I saw that her pussy was wet, glistening with juice in her crack, her inner thighs glisten with her juices, and it was even more inviting than mine was, just a good half inch in diameter. My cock was hard, long, and hard.</p> <p>"Oh," she groaned and shivered as I licked and kissed her ass and then back up to her tits and nipples, "now there's a problem."</p> <p>"Of what?" I asked, looking down at her as I began licking, sucking and kissing her.</p> <p>She reached down and touched my cock, lightly rubbing up and down it.</p> <p>"What," I asked, not knowing she had a finger in her pussy, "and no," she added as she grabbed it, feeling its hardness and her hand, too.</p> <p>I looked up at her face, seeing her smiling back at me while she fingered herself to a thunderous climax.</p> <p>"Honey," she sighed as she sat up, "don't forget the present," she joked, running her fingers through my hair.</p> <p>"What's the surprise?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's time to go. I've been waiting this for hours," she said with a little laugh. "Now you better get that stuff," she added as she lay her head on the bed beside mine.</p> <p>"Now?" I asked skeptically.</p> <p>"Just be sure you give me a ride tonight," she replied, "and once again I'm ready. But not beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
