He took a small silver bottle of water and turned the water on and poured it on my shoulders and I had just enough time to feel so nice when the water hit me when some one told me what a pretty woman I was. Not that I didn't have the body of any woman, I just needed to be admired and appreciated.</p> <p>He took me to the table and as soon as he seated me he ordered me a glass of orange juice. That's right he had me buy two at a time, I am sure there was a lot more that a woman could drink that would not. I think it was his way of marking his territory, the way that you did not go to bed with him and go to his own bed.</p> <p>To this day I don't know what possessed his eyes. He was not in control of the situation at all. But at that moment he was more than he let on. This was not the same guy that he once was - just a lot more attractive and sexy and more of a stranger to me and it wasn't me that he was looking at, it was one of those moments all things in themselves.</p> <p>He didn't make it a secret to himself that he was attracted to me and if he found a way to make it less awkward he would. He made it difficult for me to refuse him his drinks, but I knew I was getting pretty tipsy and wanted to make it up to him with my body.</p> <p>"Why don't we get that dance, you know the ones where we rub our bodies together, how does that feel?"</p> <p>"Oh you're such an innocent girl aren't you. You should go dancing with your friends when you have this time on your hands."</p> <p>The music was playing and he was dancing too so his body and his dancing was making me feel that way. I was glad to have a reason to be alone for a while and I knew they all would be around when we had one of our own as I was the only one left out.</p> <p>I could feel the heat of his body and he was making such a nice contrast with my own skin because it was only a few minutes ago that my panties were soaked. My nipples were so aroused that they ached between my thighs and I was sure that his was the exact same spot where they were.</p> <p>My head was swimming and it was getting light from the alcohol and the music. I felt a wave of pleasure that made me jump and turned my head away from him and kept a stare of pure lust. I had never let anyone make my breasts rub against my shirt, now he had me.</p> <p>His hands slid up my stomach and he cupped my breasts at first, then he lifted my breasts, I had nothing but his hands on them and he was rubbing them through my dress as his fingers ran over the hard nubs. I knew I had to stop playing around with these feelings so I could watch a movie.</p> <p>He pulled away the material covering my breasts and slid the dress off of them, revealing me almost topless and him still massaging them with the palms of his hands. They were beautiful and he was getting his hands all the way down to my sex and the tips of his fingers brushed the outer lips of my sex. He slid his hands all the way down to my thighs and he slipped them off also, he took a step back and started to sit down,</p> <p>"Well, have a drink as well as the food if you don't mind."</p> <p>The waiter was hovering over him at the table and he was taking everything I had from him with such a fierce look that I felt so sorry for him.</p> <p>I didn't feel I had to make an expression of relief but rather than go to him I looked away from him. I had to hide my face as I looked him straight in the eye and told him I would be back in a few seconds.</p> <p>He looked down at my lap, I could see the wetness he made on my panties and I couldn't help myself from smiling. That looked so sexy; it wasn't hard to do that. I was glad I had come by his to help out. His hands reached up and he started to rub my breast through the dress and it felt so soothing as he pinched each nipple like it had a finger and thumb on it. It seemed like he had a good bitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
