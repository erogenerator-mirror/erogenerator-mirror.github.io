The sight of the two of them fucking, the feeling of her breasts and the sensations of being fucked together, with another person was intense.</p> <p>Her pussy started clenching, she couldn't help herself from moving her hips to meet the two of them. She had never experienced feeling so good. She heard herself, "Fuck me you two." They kept pulling and pulling at her breasts, the stimulation was overwhelming. She saw it and she yelled again, as she orgasmed herself. Her orgasm was hard, violent, violent, she screamed, "OH GOD!" she never experienced anything like it before. She was shocked that she was feeling that kind of lust in her. She could feel herself, a slight feeling of being violated, being owned, being controlled by a man that was so strong and good. She knew she was being controlled, that her own orgasm was building and she found the need to cum again.</p> <p>Her climax finally took over her, she had to take a break from fucking so badly. They stopped her and she fell on her back, exhausted.</p> <p>She was shocked at what had just happened, and she had heard the two of them go into the bedroom and lie on top of the bed. She felt a slap come down on her ass, just as quick it came back to her body, a hard slap, that felt good. She got a smack on the other cheek, not particularly hard but just enough to send the pleasure through her body. She couldn't help herself and let out another scream and then another, another wave of pleasure was building to orgasm.</p> <p>The pain was great as she remembered him cumming on her. She was still a bit stunned that she was still being raped. She just lay there trying to get back to a new level of pleasure but that wasn't going to happen anytime soon.</p> <p>She felt his hands again, she couldn't help herself from opening her legs and lifting up to allow him more access to her pussy. She felt it, but nothing could prepare her for the feeling of his tongue inside her. They both knew what being used made her feel like, just another sensation like a person was alive and she knew what it felt like. His tongue was like fire, it was amazing. She felt it again, moving all over her pussy and all around her clit at the same time. The pleasure seemed to be building to it's apex as he licked her into a high state of mind. Her orgasm was at another level too and her moans became louder as he continued the work on her. His hands still held her breasts, his mouth on her nipples kept going until she could take no more.</p> <p>She fell limp on the bed as she felt herself being lifted. She was confused, why her body wanted to be so aroused again. She felt him climbing off the bed and get dressed. She was not sure what he wanted to do next. She could tell she would have to think about that as soon as he left, but she didn't think she had the time. He came back and sat himself down. "I have to go home," he said and then she was left alone in the room again. She heard the front door slam and she knew he had left.</p> <p>When she got home the next day, there was no note there, nothing. Her heart sank. Her next step was to call the office and tell them that she had left a message. She was to come home and make love to them and then go to sleep.</p> <p>Her hands shaking she told herself that she would at least wait until tomorrow then leave. The last thing she wanted was a man.</p> <p>She left her apartment and went to work. Today would be different, she was on her way to having sex with an unknown stranger and her lover could come and go as he wished.</p> <p>That night she tried calling them up, and when she got no answer, she put in her number and went to bed. This is going to be an interesting adventure tomorrowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
