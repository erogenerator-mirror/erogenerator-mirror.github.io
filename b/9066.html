It might have been, although no one ever saw them, when they sat on a Saturday morning at the wedding chapel that had been one of their favourite things to be said. A couple of the other bridesmaids had been there too; the husband got the message. It had never stopped them though, even when he wanted to make love to her, they just ignored him.</p> <p>But when he had been there in the evening as the first to arrive that morning, as she was getting into her black BMW, she had gone through him, not just thinking about the evening they had had. He had been hard to get off when he had been inside her on that evening. She had had to move back inside herself to sit more comfortably and not make him come in her at the risk of being too sloppy. But his last reaction had been that she had taken pity on him, and had given him a moment to calm down before doing what she had wanted. They talked the whole morning over and about what we had done, and what we had done for him. We could have been doing a lot more for him than we had.</p> <p>I sat on my chair when he got off his and went back to his seat.</p> <p>"Hang on," I said when I saw her enter his house a little while later. "That's a bit early."</p> <p>"But you'll still be here some time," she said. "You're still not back when I get home, are you Tom, aren't you?"</p> <p>"No, sorry. I'm still not back."</p> <p>"Good," she said, a little disappointed. She walked into her bedroom and closed the door behind her.</p> <p>"Come on into the study and I'll make us both something," she called from the study.</p> <p>"But how?"</p> <p>"Don't worry. I have some things to get done."</p> <p>"You're serious, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Well, yes. But I won't be going out that often."</p> <p>"Oh yes, I guess you will," she said as she pulled her jumper over her head and pulled her skirt up before sitting on her desk. "Can we have a drink?"</p> <p>There was little else he could do but nod.</p> <p>She passed him a wine glass and a second and he drank. I started to say something, and she laughed and shook her head.</p> <p>"No, it isn't the drink. I want you to enjoy yourself for a while, not just because you've already had it."</p> <p>His mouth went back to her lips the way it had been before, but his eyes weren't following any of this conversation.</p> <p>"Well," she said at last, and took his glass from his hands. "But it will be hard to do. You're not like that."</p> <p>She took a small sip of the wine, smiling.</p> <p>"You know," she said, with a small twinkle in her eye and a slight grin. "The way you have to be careful what you say when someone is talking, if you're not going to be able to say it to them. I want you to be able to say what you are thinking and think, and even see how deep you've felt about it."</p> <p>My mouth went dry as she continued to talk.</p> <p>"When someone else tells you what you'd like to be doing to them, is that what you want?"</p> <p>"Yes," I was sure I blushed with it, which only got me a little harder.</p> <p>"And as for what's going on in your heart, I think that's what you should say as well. It is the truth."</p> <p>What the hell was she on?</p> <p>"What happens then?" she asked and I knew for sure what she meant.</p> <p>"Well," he said, leaning back on his desk. "I should have guessed that when you asked me. It would have made a fine example if you had realised it when I was talking with you the other day. It was obvious." She did know that but was unsure what to say and felt uncomfortable about it.</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"It's not right," he said quietly. "And I don't want you to think that you have to do it for me. I just want you to be honest here with me so I understand."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Now, what are you going to be doing?"</p> <p>"Will you make love for me?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Good. Now let's go get something to eat so we can get back on track, do you know what you're going to do?"</p> <p>He was standing in frontâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
