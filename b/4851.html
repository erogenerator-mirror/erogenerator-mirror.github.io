"But I'm not ready yet."</p> <p>I smiled. "Why? Because you don't want to be a baby girl?"</p> <p>He shook his head. "No, I want to be a girl, you know, but not yet. It's all so new to me already."</p> <p>I was shocked at this. "Why did I wait for you? When I asked you at the wedding to help me in my pregnancy, you said I should have been the one. I should have waited and now you're talking about my sexuality. Why would I even wait so long for you to become a girl?"</p> <p>He had a serious look on his face. At this point I felt like such a whore. "I'm really not ready for that."</p> <p>"You know I don't care what you say," I insisted. "It's me, isn't it?"</p> <p>"We're through."</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>After school, we decided to get on with our lives. We were both virgins and I was in the clear, so we didn't have much of a commitment either. We started to go on dates. I asked Mark if I could go with him. He agreed and we began dating, but he also decided he didn't want any other girls in his life. He was a virgin, so it would be his first date outside of our relationship. He didn't tell me if he was married, but that wouldn't change the fact that I was the only girl he wanted in his life. We went our separate ways for now, and I moved back to my room and tried to sleep but it was to late, so I tossed and turned. When I finally found a position I liked, I had the feeling that it would help me get over my feelings for Mark, and I would be able to do it over my period next week.</p> <p>The night I got to Mark's house at the usual time, I felt like a new girl. I wore a mini skirt that barely covered the cheeks of my ass, a sleeveless shirt and heels, which were the only pair of undies I had. As soon as he knocked on the door, he took me in his arms and kissed me. We kissed for a long time and he slowly unbuttoned the top of my dress, which showed off my breasts nicely. I was wearing a lacey burgundy bra and a tiny thong. I couldn't help smiling.</p> <p>Mark then removed his shirt and pants and we made out on his couch. I felt like a total slut. I wanted him again and again. We kissed for a long time, our tongues probing each others and our hands caressing each others bodies. Finally, he pushed me back and undid my bra, which I didn't bother to put back on. We kissed and massaged each other under the mistletoe for several minutes before we lay side by side on the couch, our legs tangled together and our hands roaming each other's body. My skirt was already off. The smell of his cologne was intoxicating. He lay on top of me and kissed me again, this time deep and passionately, his lips gliding over mine, and his tongue invading my mouth, licking it greedily.</p> <p>I kissed him back so passionately that we both moaned with ecstasy. I grabbed our respective pillories. I took my time, kissing him all the while. I couldn't believe how turned on and turned on he was making me. It had been a long time, but it felt amazing. He moved up my body so that he was straddled over me, and began licking my neck and ears. He was going down on my neck again, and I loved every second of it. He took his time, licking my neck and ear, making me shiver and melt at the top of the bed. Then he pulled off my shirt and undid my bra, which meant that my breasts were now exposed to the world. I loved being naked with him.</p> <p>He took off my shoes before kissing my inner legs, lapping up the juices my lust was starting to create. Mark continued to move his tongue up and down my body, leaving his kisses there. When he got to my mound, I could feel his breath on it as he gently blew it across it. I felt so hot and turned on. I arched my back as he buried his face between my legs and tongued my pussy. He started licking my clit through the fabric of my panties, which was already slick with the juices I was feeling from his tongue. I couldn't hold back much longer. I had to have his cock inside me. I grabbed both of my shoes and pushed them off in one swift motion. I felt so vulnerable as I straddled him. My arms encircled his neck as my breasts jutted out towards himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
