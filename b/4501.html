"My name is Jonathan," he said in a very sweet voice. I'd better not to mention to anyone if the subject of the meeting comes up," he continued as he pulled another chair out for her.</p> <p>"Well Mr. Grayson, thank you," She smiled at him. With that she said, "It seems the way the meeting proceeded, our plan is to get the ball rolling."</p> <p>Jonathan was very excited about the idea but wanted to be first to hear of the story.</p> <p>"The way the meeting went was a complete success, thank you so much. My name is Jonathan" he finished his last statement to her.</p> <p>~~</p> <p>When they finally got into the conference room Susan said that the meeting had gone on longer then expected however the conversation was over. She didn't know why but she felt sorry for her friend at the moment.</p> <p>"Oh, so it went well?" she asked. "Well, let me put it this way, the reason we had such a great session together was because of the other woman in the meeting. She didn't want to be seen as a prostitute or a sex toy."</p> <p>Jonathan replied, "She does have one, actually, but is not one. You see, I'm sure you've read my profile."</p> <p>Susan laughed at his explanation, "I don't know what you mean." She was still in shock by his description.</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>As he spoke with his colleague at the meeting, Jonathan saw a small smile on her face. He wondered what she was thinking as he asked her about their plans for the next week.</p> <p>Susan was a professional but when she met with the other women at the meeting it was pretty obvious that she wanted to be available for sex, or even sex with a couple of men. She really was that easy to talk to, well at least for Jonathan anyway. She just didn't want to just jump into the office. They met with Ms. Baker after his colleague's presentation and she saw some of the others in the room and looked at each in turn.</p> <p>Jonathan was thinking to himself; if Ms. Baker could have sex with a couple of guys for the rest of the meeting.</p> <p>Jonathan and Ms. Baker talked about his job on the job with the group and he agreed to meet with Ms. Baker again when he got back to his office and they were to meet in a restaurant.</p> <p>Susan had been feeling a little guilty and was surprised when they made a date for the next couple of days when they would do some work. She thought it would be good to keep a diary so she could remember it with her own thoughts.</p> <p>~~â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
