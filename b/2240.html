I protested. My heart had stopped beating while thinking of my mother. She was a pretty, buxom woman if anything was going to make me change. "Please stop!" I whirled around to face her and said in disgust. "That's enough of this right now. I'm your father!" I shouted.</p> <p>"I'm trying to tell you," said my mother. "She doesn't have much. You'll learn," she said. She pulled out some tissue from her jacket pocket. "She didn't need it anyhow. It's all I'm doing, you know!"</p> <p>"You're taking a lot of punishment," I said.</p> <p>"So how'd you learn," said my mother. "When you were a kid you were supposed to be an animal." Her words were filled with sadness and sympathy. I hated how her words seemed to flow from her mouth so effortlessly. She never once brought me back down to earth. I didn't want it to be that way. I didn't want to give in like I'm doing right now. My dad was only three and she was only eighteen. I've got no idea how to deal with this!</p> <p>"I'm sorry?" I said.</p> <p>"You need to leave. She's not my daughter. She's your friend," said my mother.</p> <p>She reached out to my face and touched it as if to give me a hug. I felt like a schoolgirl again. I held her close and hugged her. I was so scared that I wanted to punch my mother in the eye. Instead, her hand went to my face and she smiled at me. She was a big girl. She had my full attention.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said. "I won't let you do anything. I'll be careful around her, baby," she said. Her soft fingers caressed my cheek. "You'll get a chance to make up your mind," she said. My dad always said I can't be so dumb as I think I am, I'm just not his type of kid. I didn't want to believe him. But my dad, for some reason, told me not to doubt him. My father wasn't a big, mean, bully. I thought I could take him or even force him to take me along because I felt like he was so protective. He hated making decisions for me that way. I didn't have time for that. It would have seemed wrong. I was just not ready to do that yet.</p> <p>"You know it's going to take some time," I said.</p> <p>"Happens all the time," she countered. "And once it comes, you're always up for a new experience. So far, I was too. I haven't changed that much," she said. Her hand brushed my cheek once again. I felt as if all the pain in my body had come for me.</p> <p>"It's going to be hard for you to choose," I said, "sometimes." I felt that old feeling. The feeling I get and then I'm back to square. "But it's better for you than for her. And once you start, your life will be a lot easier."</p> <p>"I'm not going to start dating until I have my heart broken. I'll always go out with guys," she said.</p> <p>"What happened to you," I said.</p> <p>"Dad would kill for me," she said. "He hates me." She touched my arm.</p> <p>"That's okay," I said. I didn't even know what she was talking about.</p> <p>"But it's not enough. I had a great life," she said.</p> <p>"It's not what it seems," I said. "It's all your life."</p> <p>"But I'm still a kid," she said. "I'm not ready to go through the whole thing again." She held my face as if she was fighting me. I didn't want to give in any more. I just couldn't.</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with continuing. I'm going to change my behavior. Maybe that's the reason you aren't going to stay with your friends," said my mother. "We'll find a way. Maybe we can talk more." My mother just smiled and looked me straight in the eyes. She leaned in and kissed me on the lips. It was so sudden. I was a little shocked. But then I could feel the warmth of her kiss. She felt real good! It felt like her whole body was glowing, her warm, soft lips, her soft perfume. All at once, my father had taken it upon himself to crush a little girl's heart. At the same time, her husband was letting her take it upon herself to do things she'd never done before.</p> <p>"Will it be okay ifâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
