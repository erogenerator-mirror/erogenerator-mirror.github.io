Yes! Oh yeah!" The first girl was on top of him, grinding her pubic mound into his, his hands gripping her ass, trying to lift her and throw her off. His fingers squeezed her ass harder, harder.</p> <p>He felt a wetness between her legs, her pussy, her lips.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" He felt her thighs shake under him, her moans, and her body going crazy with pleasure until she collapsed on top of him. He felt her pussy tighten around him as his cock twitched and shot his load into her.</p> <p>She looked up at him and smiled. "God my first white boy, and he still has that virginity he's been missing." She pulled her shirt off and threw it to one side. "I've missed that cock of yours inside me, baby." She leaned forward to kiss him, but her hand pulled back sharply to cover his mouth. She kissed him hard, hard enough that his lips parted. Her tongue darted in his mouth, then she pushed his head back and looked at the clock. "My time is up. We better get going, then, baby."</p> <p>They stood up to head to the car. She put her hand under the waistband of his sweat pants and rubbed up and down against his cock. "Honey, don't do that." She pushed his body down, then he could feel her tongue flicker over his dick, then his belly, down his shaft, then up to his head. He closed his eyes and groaned at the feeling of her tongue. She wrapped her hand around his cock, squeezed it a few times and stroked it up and down a few times. Her tongue licked it up and down. She kissed him again. Her hot breath made him shudder and growl. He didn't have a chance with her now.</p> <p>The car was a few miles away. He opened the door for her and she wrapped her arms around his neck. "Let's get going, I want more of this. We need to go back to your place. I'm still too excited." She kissed the inside of his mouth and then nibbled his earlobe, then kissed the inside of his cheek. He let her go and took her hand, helping her to her feet, leading her up a couple of steps, then around the other side of the car. The door slid shut and they took off to her apartment, her hand in his. He stepped through the doorway to unlock the door.</p> <p>They stood inside her door and paused for a moment, looking at each other. He took off his jacket and pants and hung them on the rack of clothes. She unbuttoned her shirt and it fell off her shoulders, exposing her breasts. He bent his head down to kiss one, he took in her scent as his eyes closed, then he took the breast in his mouth, sucking it gently. She moved his head back slightly. His hands moved down to her waist, but stopped before it could come down again.</p> <p>"Let me." He stepped aside and she reached up and unbuttoned her shirt, sliding it off to toss to the couch. He walked over, turned her around, and knelt on the couch. His hands moved up to cup her breasts, then moved down to her waist.</p> <p>Her hands were in his hair, slowly working his head between her breasts, feeling his lips, moving down her stomach. She felt his hot breath against her, then felt his tongue flick her clit.</p> <p>She sighed and shuddered. He kissed her, then continued to flick her clit. The waves of pleasure washed through her as his tongue went to work on her. His hands were in her hair, his fingers digging in as his tongue danced on her swollen clit. She ground her hips back into his face, pushing her clit against his tongue.</p> <p>"Oh God, oh God, honey, don't stop. Stop, honey, don't stop..." The moans she made were growing and growing, almost screams. "Don't stop!" She yelled out loudly and dug her hips into his face, trying to get a little more friction against his face.</p> <p>He pulled off her clit with one hand, then grabbed her waist in his fingers, holding her body against him as his body went crazy. It was so erotic, so sexy being held against him as her body thrashed on the couch. Her pussy was a fiery red in the moonlight.</p> <p>"God," he moaned, "Oh God, Baby... Fuck, you feel good. You feel so hot." He released her body, letting her lower body slip off his. He stood up and turned her around.</p> <p>His hands gripped her waist as he stood her up and pushed her towards the couch. He bent his head and bit her between her thighs.
