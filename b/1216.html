I knew I'd never be able to tell you how good it felt when it was all about sharing the pleasures of our bodies – our souls, our souls – it always seemed so natural to share the feelings and pleasures that you got from experiencing the pleasures of pleasure.</p> <p>The feel of our bodies pressed against one another, you holding my naked body close to yours, the kiss we shared as I slipped my hands down to hold your ass cheeks…the warmth and sensation we both got from experiencing your body was electric. Your cock throbbed in my hand as it got harder, and I felt the heat rise through my fingers as I moved up and down it.</p> <p>I shifted my body and our thighs rubbed together as the contact seemed to last forever. Soon though my cock slid down your thigh as I lay there and you began to caress my balls with your hand, I could feel your fingers sliding along my cock as they played along my shaft, teasing the head. As the heat rose in my body I could feel the moistness of your sex between us; it was as if a spark had been lit in my body, not an infinitesimal little spark as before.</p> <p>Our bodies moved faster and faster until my breath was coming in short little cries of pleasure as you began to massage my cock with your pussy. I could feel the walls of your cunt opening against my cock as your insides slid down, up and up again.</p> <p>You were almost crying with a passion my cock had never felt before, the warmth and tightness of your pussy made me shiver with delight and excitement. As the feeling of pleasure got deeper and more intense, I suddenly felt the pressure in my balls and on my shaft become more intense.</p> <p>"I'm cumming…" I moaned into your mouth as I moved my hips, pulling up off your lap towards you as my orgasm started to build inside me. Your finger went deep into my ass as we continued to kiss, your other hand pulling your breasts out from beneath your jacket over the top of your shirt.</p> <p>My cock jerked over your body as I felt the heat and power rush through its veins, my orgasm getting closer and closer with every passing moment. Even as we kissed and writhed together, I could feel the tension building within my body as the sensations of pleasure were building within me. The feel of your legs wrapped around mine as your crotch grinded against my own as we kissed passionately turned out to be exactly what I had been longing to feel in my arms.</p> <p>Your fingers stroked down along my shaft until I could feel the cum starting to seep out of me as I felt the first warm spurts of cum jet down the length of my cock as I came inside you. Your pussy started to squeeze and convulse around my cock hard as it pumped out my load and you came once more.</p> <p>I collapsed on top of you, panting for as long as we were together. There wasn't any hurry, there wasn't any hurry at all as we lay there, in a warm, sensual embrace as our bodies calmed with aftershocks.</p> <p>It seemed all too soon that after several minutes we rolled apart and I rolled off of you, laying there on my back. After a moment I turned to look at you standing in the moonlight beside me. Your hair lay in front of your face, your body was beautiful; full, beautiful, and oh so soft. You looked up at me as I watched your face, it took my breath away…there was just an innocence that came to you when I looked into your eyes. Your hair lay on your shoulders; you were just as beautiful as you had been when I'd seen her, and your face was soft, and I loved you for it.</p> <p>You moved closer to me and lay down with your head on my chest as you brushed your hair away from your eyes. Your face and breasts were there as you looked up into my eyes, it was just a beautiful expression. I could see the need in your eyes, and the need to please me as much as you were wanting to please me. Your lips felt soft as they neared mine and you slowly licked your lips.</p> <p>"I know it's difficult for you to say we're lovers, but you've got to tell me why you want to be with me," I said gently.</p> <p>"It really is just like you say!" you said with a smile and a wink.</p> <p>We lay there kissing, and I can still remember that kiss.
