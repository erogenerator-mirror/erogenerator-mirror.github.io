The softness of her lips brought his mind to the tender flesh above and below, where his eyes once had met hers. They remained there for long moments. He could feel her warmth, and a very soft and vulnerable touch, like a gentle lover. He leaned into the softness of her face and gave her a kiss for the first time on her lips.</p> <p>The softness of his lips sent thrills coursing through her body, she thought her nipples would explode. She opened her lips and their tongues probed, as the heat of their passion grew. Again, he kissed her with the same open passion that she had shown on her lips. It became more erotic. He parted his lips and touched hers. Their tongues caressed, searching for more of the same touch.</p> <p>It made her crazy. She took a step toward him, opening her legs. She took his hand and brought it to her bare thigh. He kissed each cheek on a cheek and moved closer to her. She could feel the strength of him in his embrace and her heart started pounding in her chest. He moved his body and pressed his body against hers, she could feel the hardness of his hard-on through his pants. She wanted to hold him. She wanted to feel his warmth inside her. She put her hands on his chest. Slowly, she started caressing up and down his back and under his arms, with her fingers. Their breathing increased and they moved their bodies so they could lie side by side in the softest, most sensual, embrace.</p> <p>Her right arm moved to brush his arm and his hand reached around her and touched the left nipple. He gave her nipple a hard pinch, then moved his hand a little lower than a touch. He could feel the softness of her pubic hair and that soft pussy that she had made so wet for him. He ran his hand down over her lower abdomen, he had longed to find between her legs and touch her pussy.</p> <p>She pulled back, pulling his shirt from his body. She reached down and started opening the buttons on his pants, she knew he didn't go commando, she could see the bulge in his underpants. She looked into his eyes and took his cock in one hand, stroked the shaft, and opened his pants.</p> <p>After letting his pants drop to the floor, she reached into the front of his briefs and pulled them down, then helped him step out of them. His cock stood proud and tall. It was beautiful, but not especially erotic, it was a beautiful thing to behold in her body. It was long, it was thick and it grew in her hand, she liked looking at it like this.</p> <p>She leaned forward and ran her lips down the length of it. He moaned and her eyes closed in her own pleasure. She was giving him her most erotic pleasure yet. She licked the head, she would swirl her wet tongue around it to get a taste of it. He tasted salty and salty, she could feel every vein.</p> <p>Her lips took the tip of his dick in to the back of her mouth. She stroked it, sucking, licking, and caressing it. He moved his hands over her head, feeling her warm breath on the shaft of his cock. He could feel the veins in his member sliding against the sensitive skin. Each vein on the shaft became slightly more rigid, pushing outward and outward making her mouth feel so good. He felt her hot tongue circling the head of his penis as her head moved up and down on his cock.</p> <p>His hips pumped upward each time she was taking him inside her mouth slowly. The tip of his cock was getting a hot lather between her lips, the head of his penis was covered by her saliva. The lube made it easier to slide his dick in and out. She was giving him the best blowjob of his life. She started sucking faster and started moaning over the whole length of his cock. He could feel his dick being massaged to the back of her throat, pushing a little harder each time. She took him out of her mouth and started running her tongue all up and down the shaft in front of her and over the head. She continued sucking his cock until he started pumping more sperm up into her mouth, she felt his cock contract, then the hotness in her mouth, and she felt his cum filling her mouth. The head was still in her mouth when he pulled it out. She quickly swallowed a load of his seed.</p> <p>He lay against the headboard, his hand stroking his softening cock. He looked at her, she could feel his heart racing, pulse racing, and she wanted him to kiss her again. Her hand was still on his soft penis, he kissed her cheek then her nose.
