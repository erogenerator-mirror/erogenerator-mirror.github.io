She felt him move his right arm behind her, and he began to move his fingers around the thin fabric of his own clothing. She looked at him, but he had his eyes tightly closed, as if he was in a dream.</p> <p>She broke away from them and took his hand. “Follow me,” she said, smiling in the dark of the room. She led him to the back of the bedroom, where he laid down on the bed, his eyes still closed. She walked towards the bed, her hips swaying slightly, and began to undress him, first of her own volition, taking off his shirt and his shoes and socks. He was already naked, standing at attention in his briefs, and it made her shiver from the intense feeling of their bodies intertwined. She bent right to feel the fullness of his erection with her hands, and felt him gasp as she ran her hands over his thick thighs, up to the swollen bulge at the head of his dick.</p> <p>She took a step back, and turned him towards her, so that she could undo his belt and pants and free his dick. She quickly shed her own clothes, and he was now naked, standing just inches from her body. She could feel him looking and smelling her, and she reached out with her hands to take his dick inside her hands and guide him inside. She gasped as the head of him slid into her mouth, and she took him inside until he was all the way back out again, and then slowly slid him in and out. She looked up at him from her hands, but couldn’t bring herself to lick his balls. He began to rock with her, his hand holding the headboard as she pumped him with her hands. His shaft was slick with her saliva, and she reached in towards it with one hand to rub him into her mouth, taking him into her warm tightness. He began to move in her mouth, and she moaned with pleasure and pleasure. He began to increase the speed and force of his thrusts, and she took him out and looked up at him, watching the expression on his face and licking her lips and cheek.</p> <p>“C’mon,” he whispered. She moved to the bed, layed there on her back, and beckoned him to climb on top of her. They fell together onto the bed, as he took her. She was soaking in time to him as his body lay atop hers, and the two of them began to move over as they went, him on his back, her legs spread wide. They fucked each other as he rode her, she moaning beneath him, and he growled and her body screamed underneath him, over and over, faster and faster.</p> <p>She came, clutching his body in her hands and screaming as she came. She could feel his hot load as she came, and he held onto her body, as his own orgasm rocked his body. They lay together there breathing hard, their bodies slick with sweat, and their hearts beating as they rocked and moaned in pleasure, until they came down from their respective heights of ecstasy and fall together over and over again in the end of the bed. They lay there, holding each other, neither of them speaking, neither of them saying a word, simply enjoying the feeling of one another’s bodies against each other.</p> <p>Eventually, they broke apart, and she put her arms tightly around his neck.</p> <p>“I’d like one more date?” she asked him. He looked in her eyes, and it pleased her to see the concern in his eyes.</p> <p>“What?” he asked.</p> <p>“I mean,” she said, and he nodded. “What kind of date?”</p> <p>“Well, if you wanted to, there is…”</p> <p>And with that, he pulled her close to him, and kissed her passionately. Their tongues entwined for quite a while, their kiss, their bodies, his erect dick straining against her, as if it would be able to force itself inside her again tonight.</p> <p>“But I’m not sure that I'll be able to do it.”</p> <p>“Well,” he said, kissing her again. “How about dinner?”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
