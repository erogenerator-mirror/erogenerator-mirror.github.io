That was when she noticed me walking around all that time with one of the men. At first she didn't see me but I guess she got the idea when he walked in with one of his friends. He was a tall guy with black hair and had to be around 6'3 with a muscular physique but his eyes were a bright green. Even in low light I could see that he had a very nice body too. I also noticed that he looked at me a lot and my wife seemed to enjoy having a stranger in our bedroom so I wondered if he was being very nice with her tonight. I heard a click next to my head as he walked around the room. I turned it up a bit more so he could see everything. I noticed it was at least half a head up on the head board. There were about 15 or so of them at the same time and I was sure that they had taken a good look at her body.</p> <p>As he continued to look at her I noticed that he looked at her face a lot. It could have been as much as 3 or 4 times. The closer he got the more of a flush from her chest and I could also see an outline of her right breast. She must not have noticed my spying of her from just a little distance away. I guess he was watching her from a couple of feet away when I moved the camera out of the way and snapped a shot of the other man. I watched as she turned around to face him and leaned over so that he could get a good view of her full globes from behind. When she bent over right as her hands were on the doorjamb she looked over her shoulder looking right at him while her right hand reached up behind her to grasp the bulge of his cock. "Oh, yes, you like that big cock, don't you?" she taunted him with a smile. I could see her smile as she moved back in front of him.</p> <p>"I think you should fuck him and give him a chance to cum," was the next thing I heard from her. "Look at him, he got hard. His friend will have a hard time giving you a chance, won't he." She continued rubbing her body against his hand as they talked. I was getting wet and horny watching my wife rub against her friends body. I moved the camera away as I watched and I couldn't take my eyes off her.</p> <p>"You don't mind if he fucks your wife, do you?" She said. Then she winked at his friend and started to walk toward the stairs.</p> <p>"What do you think you're doing?" he said. "You better watch your wife so you can watch the others before I take you up on this deal because I'm sure we won't be able to get your wife alone."</p> <p>"Yeah, I could see the man looking at your wife. Then I felt a pair of hands on my hips and I was so ready to turn around and let my man go at you." I could hear them talking to each other and I knew what they were talking about so it didn't really surprise me.</p> <p>I felt her body press up against my own as she turned and pressed against the bulge in my pants and I saw her tongue slowly run across her top lip. I could feel the heat and urgency of her pussy on my right shoulder as she pulled my arm tight. He looked up at me and I could see that he was very excited. Then she turned to the left and walked back to the stairs while he looked back at her. I had already gone up so I watched her go. I couldn't believe the way she turned and walked around the room and the way she acted, even though that wasn't her intention.</p> <p>The minute I got up I started the camera again and I shot more of her body. The only thing she changed from time to time was to pull her shirt up and her bra up and she made sure to give him plenty of time to get a full view of her. She kept her arms straight and I realized that as the front of her top gaped from her neck to her shoulders I could see the upper swell of her breast. My hand came down and I moved the zoom and adjusted it slightly so I could see her in all her sensuality from the front and a couple of feet below. If her nipples could stand straight and rock hard I would have seen them. The next room I changed to and I took the camera again but she had left the door open for her front so she was not only standing there but her ass was exposed and I could see her pussy lips. When she stood there again she leaned over and rested her hand on her lower back and just held herself in place. My hands were now free from the camera to do more workâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
