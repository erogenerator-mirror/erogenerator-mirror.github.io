He was so aroused and I could feel his desire and passion.</p> <p>The movement had come as a surprise, and I didn't immediately know what he was doing at the time! I could feel me juices from my sex juices coating his thigh and the warmth of him there as he began to stroke and softly bite my hip with his teeth, running the nails of his fingers over my thighs gently as he slowly began to unbutton my shirt, slowly undoing me with his teeth as his mouth went lower and lower, slowly pulling down my bra as my breasts were exposed to him fully as he slid back a bit. I could feel him kiss and suckle my lips with his, his hands sliding up and down my chest as our kisses continued, our moans increasing in intensity as he continued to unbutton my shirt as I kissed his lips, tasting his lips. Feeling his hands sliding over the smooth flesh of my breasts, his nails making my nipples rock hard as he continued his gentle caressing, licking, and sucking, licking and biting in return.</p> <p>He lifted one breast to his mouth, kissing and biting, flicking his tongue across my nipple, teasing it as he did the same to the other, his hands squeezing and caressing them as he did so and his other hand had reached up under my skirt and felt that wetness already forming as it seemed to flow heavily around her panties and onto the couch. He broke the kiss and I could smell my own sexual musk, his hand continuing to caress the soft inner flesh of my thighs as he began to rub himself along my clit, his movements quickening as he did so, the feel of his fingers pushing into me and his mouth sucking, biting on my neck. He began to work his hips, slowly working himself into a sitting position against that wetness and I could feel myself beginning to breathe heavily again and I couldn't help but moan in pleasure and then to be silent after that as my body began to shake and jerk. I could feel him shudder and quiver as he slowly lowered himself to rest upon me, our eyes holding to each others and he began to lick his fingers as they caressed mine, then running his tongue over each finger of each of my hands as his breathing took a more regular pace and his tongue found its way to mine.</p> <p>I slowly unbuttoned his shirt and we broke our kiss, our moans and gasps filled with passion and desire. Laying his head upon my breast, his mouth close to my nipple as he began to softly suck and massage me with his hand as his other hand moved from my thighs towards my sex, gently running its fingers through my sex as he pulled his mouth from my breast and began to lick and suckle at its nipple, taking the first of my large orbs into his mouth and sucking on each as his hand caressed me, squeezing my mound and running his fingers over all that wetness within and he pushed his hand into the hair of my mound and moved his tongue over it as he softly bit down ever so slightly, causing me to groan aloud in ecstasy. Leaning down, I was on my hands and knees now, my mouth on his thigh as I felt his hips begin to move slightly and he began to push his hips into me as he continued to kiss me, his breath coming in panting gasps as he continued to caress me, his free hand sliding slowly down my back and up over my hair and to my shoulder as we rolled to our sides, our eyes closed as he began to move his hips against me more gently, his hand working my clit as he was kissing my neck.</p> <p>My hands went to his shoulders, one on each side as my nails began to dig into the small of his back and up and down as I felt him pull on my nipples, pinching and twisting ever so slightly, my pussy began to throb even harder as he continued to slowly increase the pleasure he was creating in me by moving against me, and slowly licking and sucking the very tip of my lips as his tongue began to gently touch the opening of my sex, movingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
