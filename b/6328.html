It's not to be a permanent thing, though. You and I have been together five years, you haven't had any problems, and you don't feel that at all anymore. Don't look at it as if you're fucking me every now and then. You're better than that! The way you treat me the way you do, it's not just your hands that keep me going, though. You've given me great sex and you've given me great pleasure with my hands, too. I'm not sure I can ever repay you for that. I don't know what you'd say if I didn't think it's something to be happy with," I said as I pulled my face back from my wife, "and now I'm making decisions I shouldn't, and I shouldn't think."</p> <p>"I can do that," she said, "and maybe I'll get over it. This is how it is now. I'll do anything. I know you love me," she said as her hand went to the front of her pants.</p> <p>I thought, 'I'd love to take those pants down and lick out her cunt.' I did. I did anything. I fucked her and sucked her. It was the closest I'd ever been to anything and she just sat there, completely naked, stroking herself and squeezing her tits and rubbing her cunt. It was everything and more. Her tits were so soft and perky and she just sat there with her eyes closed, looking at me and thinking as I pumped into her. She started to cum and her cunt muscles seemed to contract and squeeze me as she came. There was one, followed by several more until I had lost count, and then I pulled out. I got into the doggie position again and was able to keep from cumming immediately once I started. She leaned forward, putting her arms around my neck once she'd come. We sat there and I just laid myself on her for the next twenty minutes, my cock still in her pussy, occasionally I thought about just cumming and then stopping.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I made you feel that way," she said. "I'd never have asked you to do something like that. I love you and we're so close, but we get too big from here on out, if we do this." She said as she ran her fingers through her chest hair, "I love you too, and the way you are always so good to me, and it's more than just sex. I love you too. I know it must have some feeling to you to come out and talk about having sex with your daughter if you had the nerve to mention it." I just lay there, watching her stroke her tits for me. The longer I lay here, listening to her talking about sex with my daughter, the less it seemed to be real.</p> <p>"I just want some advice. The way you guys start to come around is to think and do all of these things as much as possible and not just in one room. You have to have the same feelings in order to be sure. I know you don't have the same, or even the same feelings for having sex and all that. In other words, when you wake up, your dad is all over you and your mom is having breakfast. You're not getting out of bed until you have time alone. Or you can go the other way around. We'll figure it out in time. Right now, we're still in bed and we still have the time for that." I looked at her, wondering whether I'd screwed it off somehow.</p> <p>She stopped and just leaned back on me for a moment. "I have a plan. Maybe I can't wait too long to do this. And if you think you are going to be, it would help. I won't have sex with anyone else, and I never, ever tell anybody. Or even the people that don't care about me. I will tell everyone at school, though, and I'll probably only share them."</p> <p>I thought about it a moment. "OK. Whatever happens, we'll see. But don't forget this whole thing is going to be weird."</p> <p>She kissed me on the lips. "I will. And I'll be sure to tell my dad about this when we get up. After all, you're not cheating on your husband."</p> <p>She turned on her side, put her head up on my shoulder, and said, "It's just... I can't believe my dad is the way he is... all the shit that's happened all over the last five years!"</p> <p>"Well, it's not like you've been fucking me, although that's really a good point. I like it.
