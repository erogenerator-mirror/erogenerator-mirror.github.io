I couldn’t tell when it would happen. Would my wife give in, or would she continue?</p> <p>As you can imagine, the possibilities were endless. My husband loved it! I am in my forties about 5’ 6”, and I have no extra pounds. My husband often gets very fat and out of shape. Not to mention I tend to attract a lot of eye-candy. He has always called his wife, “my whore” or “our whore”. Now it seemed as though we were going to be one of the best of friends. Maybe things would be different and we might make out like that when he was fucking me!</p> <p>The night of the party, it was a very special evening for us both. We had been going out with some friends a couple of years earlier, when we heard our friend in the neighborhood on the radio in the background. We thought that we would give it a try. We were alone, and could feel that there was something quite hot between us.</p> <p>We were walking down the street, getting a drink, when we heard the sound of a man yelling to him and that his wife had just been verbally assaulted. As we pulled into our driveway, he stood there in shock. I didn’t say a word about it. I saw that he didn’t know what to do. We quickly got into our cars and got out in the rain to talk. That night our lovemaking was as exciting an experience as when we had sex five times, so it wasn’t all bad. He finally found some courage to come home with us.</p> <p>I did tell him what happened to me that night but I could tell from the expression on his face how much I enjoyed it. He came out of it just as I was going to tell him to hang on when it came to the real story. He came over to the couch and we shared a drink. I went and got a bag of the toys we would use, and had it all ready. There’d be lots of toys for our enjoyment as well!</p> <p>After hanging out for a while, we decided to call it a night. With nothing else to do, we went up to bed. We started it in the way we had when we were younger. I knew from past experience that having your husband watch you with someone had nothing to do with it. This time was different however, and not just in the bedroom! This time I was going to enjoy myself and did everything I could to help him with his little problem.</p> <p>It was my first time making out with a man and he was in a bit of a mess, so he didn’t make it easy on me. When he was finished with himself, we shared an early morning blowjobs. As I got up to leave, he suggested that maybe we could do it again tomorrow night since it always helps when you do the things I asked you to. If we didn’t get back to it after our little episode, we could play some other time. As luck would have it, tomorrow is another day for us.</p> <p>I did notice that he spent a little more time in his house than he usually would and it appeared he would be back the next night or two. He didn’t want to do anything with the kids or go to sleep. So, I told him I would love to help him get some sleep. We didn’t need to discuss anything else, we knew how to be a good husband – in spite of my husband’s tendency to be more conservative with her—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
