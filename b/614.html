My whole body was rigid and shaking. She stopped sucking me and stood up and pushed her pussy away from my mouth. She knelt between my legs and slowly lowered her lips to my pussy. Her mouth quickly found my clit and started to run circles around it. I couldn't hold it anymore and with a scream I came all over her face and lips. She lay down on the bed, breathing hard, her face slightly flushed with excitement as she took my body in. Her lips and face covered in my juices, she looked me right in the eyes, her smile beamed back at me. Her tongue moved around my lips and licked them, I could taste myself on her breath as she kissed my lips. I felt her hand gently pushing a little harder against my pussy as it started to respond. I felt my legs start to move as she started to massage my clit. I was on the edge of coming but she stopped just before I did. She just told me we would have to go slowly like we did at first. I thought that was a funny thing to say because I felt like I would explode any second while those words kept playing and running through my mind. I was amazed that I could take any more of that feeling.</p> <p>She told me that was the first orgasm I'd had since before I became a sex slave and that the last one had been a wonderful one. They didn't have the same power over me.</p> <p>After my last orgasm, we dressed and were going to dinner in the hope that we would meet again before the event.

But I was glad it was with someone newâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
