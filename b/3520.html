It wasn't like her experience of a sex act with a man and another girl, but she did what she had to do if she ever wanted to be with a man again. This time, this was the time that she would feel the bliss of true orgasm, this time, Dana felt like she was actually fucking a man... and the man in her.</p> <p>For a moment, her body went limp for a moment, and all she could do was lie back on top of him, and ride his cock as her pussy and the man continued their mutual fucking from both ends with wild abandonment.</p> <p>As the orgasm had passed away, she lifted her body off of the man, pulled her blouse back down over her body, and stepped back a couple steps. Her hair cascaded across the white table in front of her, leaving her chest bare. She knew now that she was still naked from the waist down, and her nipples were erect as the light of the restaurant gave way to the morning sun. It gave her a sense of pride to be a naked woman in the restaurant of a stranger, but she also knew that she was a stranger in love with a man, even though she had only been with a man a couple of days this past month.</p> <p>She opened the door and walked back outside, the feeling of being naked in front of the eyes of her employer had been almost as overwhelming as the sex had been with a man and a woman. She wanted to see that man again, to let his cock go with her again, and that would be the man she would be making him into. She walked through the front door to her car, where she knew, in the dim light still coming through the windows, that she'd be making a quick trip home and get ready for college, so that she could see herself fucking another man, her student.</p> <p>She got into her car, pulled out of the parking lot, and found herself at a bus station in what she knew would be an early part of the day, where there was free phone and internet access. She smiled as she turned off the engine and walked over to the bus stop. The old lady there in the lobby was standing there as she was leaving, looking at her watch, and shaking her head as if to say that she was late for work. The lady stopped her and handed over the cash, and she looked at the girl at the desk as she picked up the rest of her things. "I'm off to go home, you can tell her I said hi and asked her to park the car. And I'll drive her home. I'll be out as soon as I have the keys to the house in an hour."</p> <p>Dana's face broke into a pained look of disappointment as she realized that she didn't have to stay, so she walked across the parking lot to her car. She closed the door with a slam and headed home, knowing that she was going to be alone with this man, and that it was going to take that much longer than she could hope to takeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
