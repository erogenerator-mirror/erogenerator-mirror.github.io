I love it!"</p> <p>She stood up and said the car was too much to handle. I helped her into the back seat. As we drove, I began to worry that the kids were coming home after leaving us. I didn't think they would understand why we weren't getting a motel room or someplace more comfortable, we would be spending time together as a married couple. With her looking so beautiful, I was hoping that was the case. We parked the car and came back to the house.</p> <p>It was a very pleasant, relaxing day at the beach. We swam naked, got in the pool and took in the sun for a while. We were in deep conversation when Jackie came over and sat in a lounge chair. She reached up and touched my hard cock and then leaned back against me as her hand slowly stroked me. Before too long, she started sucking my hard cock. She was sucking on me with her mouth as her hand stroked me. I felt her pussy juices as she rubbed her clit.</p> <p>She came when she felt my cock swell in her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh no no! Not yet. You know, I still want our honeymoon to end."</p> <p>She got up and kissed me and then lay back beside me and we caressed each other and drifted to sleep.</p> <p>"I haven't had sex in many months, that is a long time." She said.</p> <p>She rolled on her side and we spooned our bodies together. She leaned toward me and said, it was just the best night we had ever spent; a long time, my love.</p> <p>I stroked her hair and then her back when she felt my hand there. After a half hour of just holding her and enjoying her as she slept, I got up and went back into the bedroom. I quickly undressed and put on a robe before returning to bed.</p> <p>Two hours later I was hard again, it was already 4 AM. I got up and went into the bathroom where I shaved my head and trimmed my beard. The room was filled with light, with a nice, romantic scene in the morning light. I got a soft, warm towel and put it on my shoulder. I heard Jackie wake up and then felt her start back in her routine again. I heard her say she loved being my wife. So I got up and walked into the bathroom with her towel and a soft towel, she started pulling on a bathrobe.</p> <p>"Oh yes. Take off your robe now," she said.</p> <p>I did as I was told.</p> <p>"Oh please, just take your shorts off. You aren't wearing any underwear."</p> <p>I said, "I told you I was married. So no, my wife is still a married woman. Don't you worry."</p> <p>She smiled and let the robe drop to the floor, she wasn't wearing panties. I was in my robe and there she was nude as she had been while we all fucked.</p> <p>"Do you still think I don't know that you don't care about how I feel about other women? Do you feel that we are a part of a very different world, that I'm not your wife to do you or to fuck other men?"</p> <p>"Yes, I think you're right. But do you have to know? Did we really love each other. You can fuck my girlfriend any time you like." I said.</p> <p>She smiled and moved to kiss me good morning.</p> <p>I kissed her again and felt the warmth of her body against mine. She reached down and pulled on my robe, it fell open and she moved her hand around my waist. We kissed and she held my stiff cock. She had a big smile on her face while she held me and played with my cock, she was really hot.</p> <p>I slipped my hand around her and felt something wet. She put her hand on my cock with mine. She knew what she was doing, it didn't seem to bother me when I was thinking of her. But she had never held it that way. Then it surprised me.</p> <p>She started stroking me. "Hank, wake up. It's 8 AM. Let's talk tonight when you wake up."</p> <p>I smiled and said, "Whatever you say."</p> <p>I got up and watched her from the foot of the bed as we talked. I don't want to think about how she feels about how I felt about other women, I know we all do. When I finished my thought about other women, I just told her that it wasn't important, we could do everything together.</p> <p>She said, "Honey, if you want me to fuck other women, just ask me. I want to be with you tonightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
