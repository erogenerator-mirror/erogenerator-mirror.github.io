Do you mind?"</p> <p>"Not if you're with me," the man told me. "I wouldn't want you to get hurt."</p> <p>I nodded meekly and stood, taking another glance around the room, which was now mostly filled with people, including the woman, which also looked like she'd just been fucked by an unknown man. I didn't particularly mind in that I wasn't the least bit interested in the arrangement, but still the whole scene gave me a sense of foreboding.</p> <p>The man began to remove his clothing, but after a quick glance, I saw that, for all his good will, the man was only wearing a pair of loose fitting briefs. The bulge at the tip of his dick made me smile, and I gave him a lascivious grin back.</p> <p>"Holly," he told me, "Would you please take this out? I think it will help you loosen up a bit."</p> <p>I pulled out a handful of tissues from my purse and handed them to the man. When I was done, I stood there with my fingers on my lips to avoid messing up the whole room. He glanced a bit uncomfortable with the situation, so I handed him some tissues and stood up again. He moved forward and began to knead my shoulders, but I stopped him by taking a good handful of tissues.</p> <p>"Don't touch any of that," I told him, "It'll get really messy."</p> <p>He took them and held them out to me. I handed them to him, and he proceeded to rub my back and shoulders. It didn't feel too bad to lie there with his hands all over my skin. He began to work his way down my back and I leaned back against his chest.</p> <p>"I love the feel of your warm hands on my skin," I told him.</p> <p>I was definitely feeling a bit excited myself, because I could feel my pussy beginning to tingle again. When the man took his hand away from my back, I leaned over again and leaned back to face him. We both grinned as we kissed, and I began rubbing his cock through his briefs.</p> <p>When our lips finally met, my mouth was already wide open and waiting. The warm, moist, velvety touch of our tongues was so erotic. Our lips made contact as if it were some ancient magic that we had each had a moment ago; both of us had the other's body pressed against each other's, the only thing between us. His hands had found my tits, and they felt warm and soft as they brushed against them. It felt really good to suck on his tongue, to explore the interior of his mouth in another way; to know our bodies. It felt even more satisfying to have him touching me as I explored his body.</p> <p>After a moment of this, he pulled me gently toward him; my hands went to his hips and I lifted myself up slightly so that I could slide his briefs from his hips. He helped me lift myself up onto the bed, and I got on top of him as I continued rubbing and caressing his cock and balls. When he was fully hard, I bent down and took him into my mouth and began sucking him and playing with him.</p> <p>I felt him stiffen as he began to thrust gently into my mouth; it was like someone had made a big, fat, hard cock for me to suck. He began to moan and I felt his hands rest on the side of my head as much or more than necessary to prevent me from leaving him. I felt so proud as I took his cock further into my mouth, swirling my tongue around it and feeling the heat of it.</p> <p>By the time I was done, I felt the familiar swelling within my panties and I knew I didn't have long to wait. When he began to throb and I sensed him getting nearer to coming, I stopped sucking him long enough to tell him, "Cum in my mouth. Let me feel your spasms as you explode. I want to taste your come."</p> <p>He groaned and I felt his body jerk as he released more and more spurt after spurt of come into my mouth. There had to be no mistake; it felt fantastic having his come flood my mouth, and it seemed it was going into my throat instead of just running down my lips.</p> <p>I pulled away one last time to see the most alluring expression on his face and felt the last few dribbles of his come splash against my cheek and neck. While I felt as aroused as I have ever been in my life, there was a different message in the way he'd said "Thank you." I felt very happy to have been complimented, and I felt that I had to reciprocate.</p> <p>"Well, I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
