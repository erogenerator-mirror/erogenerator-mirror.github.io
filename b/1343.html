That'll look great."</p> <p>"I want you to just stand there while I go and get your blindfold and gag ready."</p> <p>With some reluctance I followed her out of the store but then she said, "We're going to the mall. If you leave now, I won't hesitate to gag you again tonight as you were."</p> <p>"Thank you. I think that's a great idea."</p> <p>With a nod in the direction of her cell phone, I headed out to the mall myself without looking back. I didn't see her. I just knew that I would love to have her all tied up again. Just knowing that she was there while I waited for her with my blindfold on didn't seem like such a big deal. But this time I really didn't have any choice. I headed to the mall in the direction she took me.</p> <p>When I finally arrived, I was surprised that she didn't stop me. Instead, she asked, "Do you still want to join me at the mall? That's a good idea."</p> <p>"I'd love to. But I need to get home before they know."</p> <p>"Good. Then, come along. We're going to the mall, so they won't think we're doing anything but shopping and getting to know each other."</p> <p>A look of surprise came to my face, but then I couldn't think of anything else but the look of uncertainty that she gave me.</p> <p>"Okay, that's great. Let's go."</p> <p>I followed her, not wanting to get in the way. She led me to the entrance of the mall, and then into an area where a large number of women shoppers were selling shoes. She turned to me and grinned. "If you don't hurry enough, I may take a look at something that looks good to you."</p> <p>"That would be lovely."</p> <p>She reached into her back pocket and came out with a ring with a big ring on the middle. I think that I was hoping to see them as I stood there wondering what the hell that was.</p> <p>"What is that?" I asked.</p> <p>"The engagement ring I was wearing."</p> <p>"That was your last item?"</p> <p>She smiled and said, "That's the one that you bought the first time that I was at the mall with you. That's the one we bought the other day. The others are waiting for us there."</p> <p>"Oh, so you're going to put those on?"</p> <p>"Yes. I think I'll have to buy the other ones too. I'm not sure if I want them on you and we need to be careful. Now, are we going to the mall now or do you have something else to see?"</p> <p>I felt a little nervous and didn't know what she might think of me for buying such an interesting gift. "The first thing is to look at a few pairs of shoes that I'm buying. These are the shoes that women wear here today."</p> <p>She looked me over for a moment.</p> <p>"Do you still want me to put this on you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Now, let's go."</p> <p>After an almost scary time shopping, we finally went back into the shoe shop. I had to get the four different pairs of shoes that she'd picked out for me. I was really hoping that I was going to be able to choose the best shoe in the store. To my surprise, she put all of the pairs in a bag from the store.</p> <p>"This must be for that special night we shared and that you like so much in the mall."</p> <p>She smiled at me with a mischievous look. "Remember that you bought that for me and I enjoyed it just as much in the mall as you did. Now, let's go."</p> <p>We headed toward the mall when the two of them arrived. It turned out that they were waiting in line for almost a third of the store. They asked for a lot of things as they were so happy to see her so anxious to get shoes. She almost cried when they came out with an amazing looking pair she loved so much. They were a bright red with the same black heel that she had on me so many years ago. They were perfect for her.</p> <p>"Is this the special night of your fantasy to be this close to us?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, honey. I think that it is. I can't tell you how beautiful and exciting that night has been for me. But, this must be the only thing that you want to add to your 'special night.'"</p> <p>She reached for the box that she'd been putting there for me and said, "I hope you're going to love this because every other time that I see those shoes, I want you to come see them to see that you didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
