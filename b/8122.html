I was amazed at how good he looked at this range. His skin glistened in the moonlight and the wetness of my juices as they trickled out like drops of wetness. He lifted my hips once more, and pulled me toward him, his lips touching mine. The kissing that ensued only served to increase my desire. My hands found the sides of his head, which made him arch back slightly as his tongue found the edge of my lips, tracing them before slipping itself inside. I wrapped my legs around his back as my own lips found his mouth and I tasted myself on his lips.</p> <p>I could feel him respond, as his hand found the curve of my rear and pushed my mouth away from his, just a second. He smiled at me and I pulled away slightly, smiling down at him, and brought him into my sight before he had a chance to move. I took his cock between my fingertips and guided it to my mouth, and he gasped and moved back so that his hands could rest on my legs. I smiled as he watched me, his cock standing up at attention before he began to lift me up, as he carried me to the bed, where my knees hit the mattress. I let his cock slide down my slick skin, and he took me in one hand so I would be comfortable. I took him all the way in, feeling the warmth of his cock through the thin membrane that separated our bodies. Once I adjusted to his thickness, we both took our time, moving slowly, gently until he pressed me down again and again. As he did each time, I felt my body begin to writhe under his hands as he fucked me. My pussy started to ache suddenly, needing release once more. I could take the pain of his hand in mine for an eternity or two, but if I wasn't on the brink, I'd be glad to continue.</p> <p>I felt his hand on my back, and knew that if our lips had met, I'd have found his lips there. But I also knew that when we did, that the feel of that tender spot, was beyond what any man would have expected. My body clenched, and I could tell he did as well, as he brought me to what I knew would be the most intense orgasm of my life when we finally came together. I had wanted that moment so badly, but it didn't happen. My pussy clamped down around his cock as he kissed me, and I moaned aloud and squeezed him tighter. He let me ride on him, feeling my body move and move under his as I lost the control of my body.</p> <p>I leaned forward more, and rested one arm on his chest as it continued to rise up to meet the next thrust. He thrust faster, and the other hand began to trace the inside of my breasts as our bodies collided together again and again. He moved over my body, pushing my back, and my back and my back as I opened myself to him. He took his time, allowing me to get into a rhythm, enjoying every moment as the sensations drove me to new heights.</p> <p>He kissed my neck and ears as I felt his cock swell to new heights. My own hands were busy between my legs, and I could feel the hot cum of their mutual love on his fingers as he rubbed on my skin. He had cum already, and he was ready to take me. His hand moved down to rub against my clit, while his cock drove itself into me, and the feeling of him inside me, brought a new level of ecstasy to my body. The feeling of my pussy tightening, as I was about to come, and the sense of wanting him to fuck my face with his cock sent me over the edge. His cock jerked inside me as he came deep inside me, flooding my pussy with his cum. We collapsed on the bed together, feeling his softening cock slide from my pussy. Our bodies remained motionless, and he kissed me again as the first of our orgasms passed, and he moved up and gently stroked my face.</p> <p>He gently began to move, and I moved with him. I put my arms down and he wrapped my waist and mine around his neck as his hands moved to my ass. He turned so our bodies were perpendicular to each other, and moved to lie between me and our bodies. "Thank you," I said, and he smiled. He continued to kiss his way up and down my body, and I felt his hand brush against my clit as his lips began to do things that I had never imagined. He brought my hands to my face, and the moment I took in his eyes, my own, they began to darken. Suddenly, I felt a rush of pure, hot sensation, as he was going to finish what he had started.
