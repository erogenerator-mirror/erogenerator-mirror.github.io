If anyone asks, I'm out and ready to go somewhere."</p> <p></p> <p>"It's a surprise. I can imagine." Jessica walked out to the car...wet, swollen lips pursed between her legs. "Just hold out and you'll be right where you're going to be."</p> <p>Jessica had never taken a male's manhood into her mouth before in the past. She had to say her "man" name but the only way to say it was "you", that was all she knew about most. She was so embarrassed for her inexperience with this guy that she stopped.</p> <p>"Do you want me to take the car in back? I've got nothing stopping me from using it to walk," she lied, "or do you want me to take the car back?"</p> <p>Jessica was not happy at all being the "man" for this whole event. But in a way, she was also surprised at how attracted she was being to this girl. He was a very handsome young man, all around and he was an amazing woman. She decided she would do anything for him.</p> <p>Jess walked across the street to her house and unlocked her front door. She rang the bell just as a knock on the door was heard.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry. My husband will be home soon. He's in the bathroom. How do you like your dinner?"</p> <p>Just as Jessica was about to answer the door, she could hear people coming around the corner. "That bastard!" Her face turned beet red.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." Jessica hung up the phone. She felt so very embarrassed for lying to her husband.</p> <p>Jess looked over in her closet, not seeing the key. She took a moment to compose herself before pulling out the keyring and opening the door.</p> <p>To her surprise, Jason was wearing a white and blue bathrobe and nothing else. She was not surprised to find all of the lights had been turned on except one, which was on the sofa, next to a large leather sofa. The room was lighted by a single table lamp and by the sound of conversation, she could see a large pool of light on the floor. Beside that was a small wooden X-ring.</p> <p>Jess quickly took off the robe and went to him. "My husband isn't here."</p> <p>Jason stood in front of her and took her hands in his.</p> <p>"I can't believe you fell for my lie," He said, "I can't believe you did that. You can't believe how I feel at that moment."</p> <p>Jessica felt her heart going through the roof. She was still in shock at how stupid she had been. He asked her to walk around the room as if he were going to make love to her. She thought she was going to fall in that pool of light she was so afraid he would make her orgasm.</p> <p>"It's ok. I'm here to make up for it. You made me so aroused by the call call, what's it about?"</p> <p>"Let me hold you," Jason whispered.</p> <p>Jess couldn't resist. She leaned into his touch. Her body was on fire. There was no turning back after what she had let her man do to her.</p> <p>"Jason. Stop," she said quietly in his ear. She kissed his earlobe.</p> <p>"Take off your robe. Get on your knees and worship me."</p> <p>Jessica slowly complied. Once her robe was off, Jason said "I thought we were going to have sex. We are," he whispered, "I told you I am going to make love to you right now."</p> <p>Jess saw a look in his eyes that she had never seen. He wanted to make love to her. Was he asking her for the chance to get away with what she had told him. She wanted to turn him down but she didn't. She had never acted this way about anyone. She wanted something more from him and he obviously felt the same way.</p> <p>"What are you waiting for? I'm your step-daddy now. Do it," he ordered. It made her feel wanted and alive, like no other woman she had ever been with.</p> <p>Jess pulled down his bathrobe revealing his large, muscular arms and torso. His muscular arms were a treat to her. She could feel the lust in him she had never felt while making love. Her panties were wet between her legs. She looked up at him. He smiled.</p> <p>"Get to know your father's penis," Jason said as he pulled her towards him. "I'm going to make love to you."</p> <p>Jess couldn't resistâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
