Is there something I can help with?"</p> <p>Gillian gave her one of her more loving smiles.</p> <p>Gillian opened the bag and removed her bra. Her breasts were magnificent. She held them with one arm. There she held her long blonde hair up in a ponytail and asked, "What do you want to bet on? Or should I take it that you're the man you thought you were just going to watch me play with myself?" she asked her voice sounding like a school principal.</p> <p>After all her teasing she now knew the answer. She was definitely the girl she would be. She started to undress for him and he looked back a little surprised.</p> <p>"How much?"</p> <p>Gillian's heart started to beat a little faster. She stood motionless as she looked him in the eye, "You bet! If you're sure you want to bet!" she answered.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure," he said and started to undress. "This is going to be fun!"</p> <p>After he had finished undressing he sat down on the couch. She got down between his legs. He placed his hands on her shoulders and leaned back and closed his eyes. He smiled and started to feel her tits slowly. The nipples had a slight sheen which was different than what he had felt before. That was almost like a new experience. While he was sitting there with a woman's lips wrapped around his cock they were also touching and squeezing him.</p> <p>"Oh, man, don't stop!"</p> <p>He looked and his expression gave it away. He started to move his hips up and down while his other hand reached down her back and started to caress her ass cheek. As soon as the word 'ass' left his lips she let out a little gasp and opened her eyes again. It didn't take long for his cock to be throbbing from the attention it was getting from her mouth and the way her eyes were looking into his.</p> <p>"Oh God! I love your cock..." she whispered.</p> <p>She wrapped her lips around the tip and felt his pre-cum on her tongue. She slowly lowered her pussy onto it to feel every sensation of her pussy. Her pussy juice started flow again for the taste and the sensation. Even more juices were flowing down her leg. She lowered her pussy onto the whole length of it on her own and felt it hit something deep within her. She started to move it up and down over some part of her body and she felt her body start to shake. Her eyes started to open in a bit of pleasure and her eyes started to glaze over.</p> <p>"Oh yeah...That's it... Fuck me... Oh...that feels so good..." she whimpered.</p> <p>His words and the situation made her body come down even harder again. His hands went around her waist and started to lift and lift her off of his throbbing cock. It got closer with each downward jerk of his hips.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhhhh, that does feel nice!"</p> <p>He started to lift her up off of him. He let go his hands and grabbed her by those ass cheeks and lifted her up again and sat her back down on his cock again. He didn't do it very hard but that didn't prevent her from getting more turned around on him.</p> <p>After a while it started to get harder and she lowered her pussy onto his cock. It wasn't a soft down but it was also still hard as a rock. The difference of the size of his cock and the way it felt when he hit her from the other end was also great.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, just like that!" She was saying over and over again. Her pussy was sliding up and down on his cock. As it became harder each time her body started to tremble, "Oh yeah... oh yeah... just like that!"</p> <p>Gillian let out her own little scream which brought a smile to his face. When the words came out she couldn't control herself as she had her legs tightly wrapped around his hips. He could feel the walls of her pussy as it rubbed all over his cock. She grabbed her hair and used it as a handle so she could hang on for dear life. He started to move his hips up and down so his cock would rub against her clit again.</p> <p>"Oh yeah... that's nice..."</p> <p>He pushed the tip of his cock between her lips. Her pussy was on fire from the feeling of him moving it and the friction. The pleasure she received increased slightly. Every time she was on his dick he would just stay in there for a while and then slide out, only to do it all the the few times she had a chance to really get herself going. Her pussy was just like the woman she had fantasized about it. She was a natural born pussy. It seemed more alive when having him inside it.</p> <p>"Oh!
