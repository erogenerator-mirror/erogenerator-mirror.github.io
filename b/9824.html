What do you mean?" he asked, trying to hide his discomfort.</p> <p>"Look, you want the show, I'm doing it" she said in a coy, almost mocking tone. "If that's a problem, don't worry about it, its okay" she said.</p> <p>"Sorry" Mike said.</p> <p>"No," she persisted "I mean if I didn't know better, I'd say you were making more money than me" she added.</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"So" she said, "I want you to suck my tit for me, and if you're uncomfortable, take your cock out and wank. You're a good guy, you know the whole thing" she said.</p> <p>Mike was startled by this revelation but couldn't think of anything to say. He didn't want to put on a show, not really, but he found the notion appealing.</p> <p>"Yeah OK" he said.</p> <p>"Great" she told him and grabbed his cock before leaning forward with her head to the side.</p> <p>Mike quickly pulled his cock out from his pants and sat on the couch feeling very exposed and unsure.</p> <p>"Suck on it, suck on it" she hissed, "Suck on the tip, make it wet, and then really swallow it" she said.</p> <p>Mike looked up at her. What was she suggesting? Why would she want to do this with him in such close proximity?</p> <p>He slowly took his cock in his hand and started to wank. He was stroking it in slow motion, his fingers working around the head. He looked up at her.</p> <p>"Oh yes that's perfect" she said "I like it when a guy wanks" she finished lamely.</p> <p>Mike took his cock in his hand and started the slow wank again, watching this woman he just met for the first time.</p> <p>"Don't be nervous" she said.</p> <p>"I'm not, its just -"</p> <p>"Its just fine", she reassured him.</p> <p>She slid her panties off and climbed towards him. Mike looked down and saw she was already starting to finger herself. His face burned as he felt his cock pulse and he could feel his own juices soaking through his pants. She climbed right up to him, straddling his thighs, the weight of her perfect round globes crushing against his groin and her pink wet lips inches from his face. He couldn't believe this as she was a few feet from being on the other side of the car park and there was someone else in the driver's seat waiting for him.</p> <p>Looking around the park, he could just make out a couple of people, a woman with children, or a man looking down at her. She got down on her knees so he could suck her tits without being seen.</p> <p>"That's right" she said. "I want to suck your cock" she said.</p> <p>Mike could only imagine the look in his eyes as she looked down at him with a huge smile on her face. She took hold of his head and slowly guided his mouth onto her breast. He opened his lips and her nipple pushed through as he rolled her nipple around with his tongue. She moaned as his head travelled down to her pussy and he licked her juices from his lips.</p> <p>"Come on" she said, "stick it in me" she said, pulling her panties off.</p> <p>Mike did as she asked and she guided his cock into her. She rubbed her inner lips up and down the full length of his shaft before sinking down on top of him. They moaned together as she bounced up and down on him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and he reached out to caress her breasts with his hands. Her body rocked with his rhythm.</p> <p>He looked at her and knew she was about to come. He could feel his balls tightening and knew he would explode soon. He looked at her face. She had a look of ecstasy on it. She wanted him to come and she wanted him to come she felt as if he would lose his load inside her. They went at each other frantically and she could feel the orgasm coming but no sooner had she told him that was the last straw. She came as he came in her.</p> <p>He lay on top of her, a couple of years later. She wrapped her arms around him and kissed, his neck, his shoulders, his shoulders. She pulled the hair from her face and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes" he said, "that was fantastic".</p> <p>"I'm glad" she said, "I never thought I'd do that" she added. "I never thought it would be like that" she added withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
