Don't worry about it. I don't ever want to lose you, not when I'm all out with the idea of doing it again, not when I feel like I'm missing something so I just got a break from it. Anyway, it feels weird that you are having sex with me. But it's not for free. If you were going to cheat on me that would probably just cause more problems. But now I feel like cheating. So there, that's a win win situation. That way I won't have to tell you what I'm thinking anymore." With that I take her hand and lead her to the bed and lay on top of her.</p> <p>There is a moment of awkwardness then we both laugh. After that we get some sleep and start to play around with our new toy. I wake up with the dildo stuffed into my pussy before finally slipping out and leaving her to get ready for some of her friends from work.</p> <p>A few days after that we do a little exploration in our new toy. I have her stand against a pillar by it, and she slowly inserts the dildo deep into her vagina, so we can both know she's well lubricated. Then she turns it on high, and it starts vibrating all over our bodies. It even sends electrical impulses up into our bodies. She gets really turned on herself, and she begins to get as excited as she can, her pussy getting sopping wet as she rubs against it.</p> <p>"Just go with the flow, and go slow," I whisper, "Just take your time." I am smiling as I say that to her.</p> <p>"You're going to take all this time with me," she states as I watch her get excited. "You think I can take this, you know that's what we've all been wanting to try and you're going to take it or me. You're doing me so good that you're going to get in a little trouble."</p> <p>"I'm not going to argue, I'm going to do this for you," I tell her. She looks a little worried.</p> <p>"But if you don't like any of this, you don't have to stop. Just go slow," I tell her. "But don't get too excited. I don't want to hurt you, but just keep going. I won't break you, and I'll be gentle." She blushes.</p> <p>"You're right, I'll be careful with how slow we are. It's just that I feel so dirty, you're making me feel so nasty, and there's so little of it you can get away with, and I like it."</p> <p>I start to move the vibe back and forth over her body getting her excited enough to keep going. She doesn't know where it is going but it feels good. It's also kind of weird seeing her squirming on the ground as she starts to get excited, but it goes away just like she likes it. Then she realizes some more.</p> <p>"If... if I make you want to come, I don't think I can stop. Please I need to feel you come." I love teasing her like that. It has never made me feel this way before. I love it. I want her to feel like everything is going to be fine as long as she can trust me.</p> <p>She's trying to concentrate for the first time since it started. She's still so very confused by the whole idea. "Okay," she says, "But I'll ask for permission first." I nod okay. Her eyes widen. I know she's nervous because she's never done this before, but she doesn't know what to feel when it is her first time. She reaches down to run her hand over her sex through her panties. They're damp, and there is a little juice there, and I can watch it glistening as she strokes her pussy. I see the glaze as she rub it on the material covering her vagina. It seems as though she's trying to make it last, and the way she's stroking the fabric feels great. I know that after a few minutes of this her body is going to be ready to burst. But once I tell her that her body is really ready, she can feel it. It's kind of odd watching her masturbate, knowing it would feel wonderful.</p> <p>"Here, help me get you ready for that, I know you're getting really excited," I tell her. "This will be interesting if you don't have any plans." She seems to relax and doesn't have any plans.</p> <p>After she's done using her hand to try and make herself come, she sitsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
