It's been a bit too long, and that little thing doesn't work."</p> <p>The question was rhetorical. The metal was about the size of an eye-patch, I thought. She got it off her lap, and she held her breath as she put it on. She turned it down gently.</p> <p>"I don't know what's going on with this thing."</p> <p>"It's got that thing! It's made out of metal. That thing was made to make a girl into a man."</p> <p>She was lying. Yes, I had had a bit of fun with that device, and that wasn't the point.</p> <p>"I don't know why, and I can't explain it all, but..." What? Why can't I explain how I couldn't think of why I did this?</p> <p>"Why don't you ask me anything?"</p> <p>"I've got some questions, and I can't even think straight" she said, looking at a piece of paper.</p> <p>"Okay," I said, "What is this all about?"</p> <p>"It's very complicated."</p> <p>She turned and faced me.</p> <p>"What about it. Does it affect you physically?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She was still looking at the paper.</p> <p>"I'm a girl."</p> <p>She looked at me and then at the device.</p> <p>"You... you think... I'm not any better than any of this..."</p> <p>I wasn't sure what to say. I started to say something, but she put her finger on my lips.</p> <p>"I'm not really sure what I am, or how I am... I don't know what I am, it's hard to explain..."</p> <p>She kept looking at me, but didn't say anything. Then she kissed me on the lips. She pulled away, and I felt a tingle run through my body. She turned my head to one side and her tongue darted out from between her lips and into my mouth. Our lips met, and we shared our tongues passionately. I pulled her closer to me, and our kisses grew more passionate as we kissed and touched each other passionately. I opened my eyes and looked into hers. Her face was expressionless, and I felt nervous. She gave a little tremble and a nod. I knew that if I said anything, she might just tell my parents and tell her life story.</p> <p>I put my hand on her hips and helped her down from the couch. She smiled at me and I pulled her onto my lap. Her legs were pressed against my crotch, and she looked at the floor, smiling. She moved towards me and pressed her lips to mine as I opened my lips to hers. Our tongues entwined as if they were one. She broke her kiss and looked into my eyes, and we stared at each other in silence, as if waiting for a kiss to be returned.</p> <p>"It makes me..." I said.</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"Just relax." She said.</p> <p>"This shouldn't..."</p> <p>"You know I'm going to tell you anything you ever wanted to know."</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said, "You can tell anything about this to anyone you ever wanted to know. And we aren't going to hide anything from anyone either. We are the ones we love, aren't we? And if you ever want to ask me what I'm doing, I'm here to tell you."</p> <p>She kissed me.</p> <p>"I'm not sure...</p> <p>"I want to see..."</p> <p>She turned me and placed her mouth on the side of my head while she unbuttoned my shirt. I felt her breasts against my chest, and she pulled my shirt up over my head.</p> <p>"See what happens when you look into my eyes," I said.</p> <p>She smiled and kissed me again, this time even more passionately. She placed her hands on my stomach and I felt her fingers touch my skin lightly as she moved closer to me. I felt her small hand on my chest and the back of my head as she pulled away from me, and she looked at me with an expression of lustful desire. I felt my cock growing. She ran her hand up and down my chest and neck and she kissed me once between my lips. I felt her hands on my neck and shoulders and I sighed deeply. She kissed me gently and her tongue probed my mouth ever so lightly. Then there was a sudden change in her mood, not quite at her words.</p> <p>"Shâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
