The woman said and stood up, reaching out her hand to take the glass of red wine and set it on the table. "You'll be okay, dear. You and your little friends will not have any problems now. You have a lovely evening ahead."</p> <p>I looked at the other young woman in shock as she turned around, her eyes wide. I had never seen a woman put there before, never had the courage to even think about it. I don't remember it being as embarrassing as this.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said, "I am all yours." I didn't think I could handle a woman with that big a body like my wife. "We'll have some more wine before we go up." I said. I looked at her, my mouth dropping open. She nodded, giving me a smile that I immediately knew she didn't care for. And I was wrong.</p> <p>When we got to the door, I held out my hand, shaking it lightly. "You are most welcome, ma'am. Thanks." She took my hand. "You're very kind." She leaned in and kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>"Bye for now, sweet," She said and walked away.</p> <p>"What was that all about?" I asked and turned back to the young woman.</p> <p>"There are two girls sitting around the bar. They asked me to have them for a dance," She said and she and my wife followed the woman over to a group of lounge chairs in the side lot.</p> <p>One of the women, a gorgeous blonde named Jan, sat down, putting a glass of wine glass between her legs.</p> <p>"Well, my name is Jan," She said and looked at me over her shoulder. "And you, dear?"</p> <p>"Uh... I'm John," I replied and I took a sip.</p> <p>"I'm Marie." Jan said, smiling the biggest smile I've ever seen on her face.</p> <p>I looked at her and then at the other woman sitting on the other side of Jan, her hand squeezing her own breast through her blouse. "Well, um, you'll have to excuse the girls in the crowd. Those are all young enough to be your daughters, and they're dancing pretty loud." I shook my head and walked away.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>We got to the bar and I ordered two more tequila shots as we stepped out onto the dance floor. I danced with Jan over the last couple of songs, my hands on the woman's hips and her legs pressing against me, my cock pressed up against my zipper under the skirt.</p> <p>The song ended and I sat down, holding Jan's glass of wine. I had a quick thought of myself, a big, stupid fucking jerk.</p> <p>"So," Jan said. "What happened to us?"</p> <p>"Sorry to burst your bubble, honey," I said.</p> <p>"Forgive me." She held up her empty glass. "No, I'll have another," she said. "A whiskey for my sweet, little friend."</p> <p>I reached toward the other woman, my hand bumping hers. "I'll be right back."</p> <p>"Honey? You're right," Jan giggled. "Let me get that again."</p> <p>My hands were at her waist when I was led, I felt her pull my head closer to her. "Mmm, kiss me, kiss me. I want you," She said, pushing my head away. "Please?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure I've kissed a girl that big before... that I wouldn't have any of to drink to." I could tell she was hurt.</p> <p>"We're going to have to get you home and change your clothes," she said, putting her hand on my hardon. "Don't worry. I won't tell."</p> <p>"I'll be home now," I said, reaching into her purse. "I'll walk you, and you won't have to wear this to work." I pulled out a small bag and slipped my arm through her and pulled her close. "I'll walk you, as long as you promise to sit close to me in the back."</p> <p>"Oh, honey, I can't do that, I'm sorry," Jan whined and grabbed my hand. "Come with me! Let's go to my car and go from here. You can keep the bags tonight. It's your night."</p> <p>She reached for the bag and opened it, pulling it out of her purse and holding it to her chest. "What the fuck? Where's our bags here?" I laughed.</p> <p>"They're in the back," Jan said, holding out her arms. "I'll get to your car first, then follow, so you can change your clothes and get home."</p> <p>I led Jan toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
