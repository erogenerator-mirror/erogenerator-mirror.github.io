I was still wearing her heels so she stopped walking at the very top of the stairs, giving me a chance to run a brush with her hair, the one with a bun. I tried to hold my emotions in. Everything that had happened tonight had been an accident, and it was all due to her. With a nod, she turned to go and I followed her. She seemed lost in thought. I followed her down the last few steps, almost as if I hadn't done anything, still looking for any sign of what had been a terrible mistake.</p> <p>As the steps of the steps to the third floor came closer, I could hear the faint sound of the toilet flush. I went ahead and set the water in front of the sink, closing the door. Before I could turn on the water, though, I saw her emerge from the bathroom, her hair in a pony tail, and her smile beaming. She handed me my clothes, which I put on quickly, before taking my keys. "Thanks, I needed to start somewhere."</p> <p>"You don't have to thank me," I replied, holding onto the phone so there wasn't any danger it would catch her. I pressed the button for my locker room, "I'll be waiting in the car, let me know." With a wave, she disappeared into the locker. She looked back at the door, and blew out a long breath, before walking to her locker. My heart skipped a beat. I stood there for a second, looking at the empty space in a mirror, trying desperately to convince myself that our relationship was only a brief fling. I had hoped to spend the night and fall in love.</p> <p>As she closed the lock, my heart leapt with excitement, not knowing how to react. She leaned against the door, watching me through her short hair, waiting for me to reply. Finally, I walked back to my car, pulling a face to block out whatever was lurking in the back of my head. By the time I got to the parking space, my head was spinning. I put my sunglasses in back of my head, before I opened my car door and slid into the truck.</p> <p>I started the car, and stopped, sitting with my head down, wondering if I could actually drive. I glanced up at the mirror to see my reflection, but my eyes didn't meet hers. Instead, I saw a shadow. The light in her eyes was like that of a shadow, casting a shadow that I couldn't even imagine in my head. I could hear the soft clicking of keys in her hands.</p> <p>"Hello, sweetheart," I said, my voice a raspy whisper.</p> <p>"Hello me, too." her voice was flat, melodic. "What are you doing here?"</p> <p>"Just taking care of... my girlfriend..." I started to cry, trying to cover my pain as best as I could. "It's been so long. I'm a mess."</p> <p>She gave me a tight smile. "I figured you'd know by now."</p> <p>"I know. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." I wiped my eyes and began the truck's turn.</p> <p>She didn't say anything, but her expression made it clear she meant every word. I looked down into the seat, trying to focus in on how she looked at me. We stared at each other like that for a few moment, the air between us getting hotter by the minute. I took my right foot off the gas pedal and began to pull up alongside the highway, trying to keep my eyes on hers.</p> <p>"What are you doing here?"</p> <p>"Waiting." I felt like I'd gotten a big confession. She was going to meet a boyfriend. If she was going to date a different guy over the next few days I thought I'd go crazy. My stomach was doing somersaults.</p> <p>"What do you mean," she asked, a note of worry in her voice.</p> <p>"Do you want to come over tonight?" I asked, trying to put my worries aside as quickly as possible. It was bad enough that we'd end up in bed, but now I couldn't face her again.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Why not. It's been a long time, you know. It's just..."</p> <p>"Its business." She leaned forward on the seat, and put her arms around my shoulders, "And I just want to say we are serious, right?" she looked serious before she kissed me, her tongue probing mine, as if to say she wouldn't push things if I didn't. She broke away from the kiss, and ran her fingers through my hair. I was breathing heavily, my hands slipping through her hair, to steady myself. I didn't really want her to leave, so I simply nodded.</p> <p>We drove in silence for aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
