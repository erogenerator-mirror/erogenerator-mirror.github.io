What are you looking for?" Mr. K asks.</p> <p>"I want to help you with the business side of things. I want to be a better employee for you and for the team." I say honestly.</p> <p>"That makes sense. Is there anything you need that you need to find out before you start work tomorrow morning? I could get you a day off if you liked." He asks with a wicked smile.</p> <p>I reply, "I would love to work for you Mr. K, I have a summer job right here."</p> <p>"Great, I'd be happy to have you work for me for as long as you can. I know you're young and I'm old school. If you like that, your dad won't mind, we can work together in the office. The company wants to take you on as a team leader. I've really not had a good career before, so I am just a junior on the team. I think you're really going to be a great asset to the business and people around here. You have done very well here for yourself. Now I want to give you all the help you need to get your future set-up. You'll be a great asset for my team. If you're going to help me for anyone, I'm more than willing to pay it for your help. Is there anything else you'd like to ask me?" He asks.</p> <p>I realize it's a good idea if I can get the people who work for me to let me know. I get a big smile on my face as I say, "It would be very nice if you could give me the help I need on a personal basis. If there's something you enjoy, just ask me and I'll do it for you. I can do anything for you," I tell him honestly.</p> <p>Mr. K smiles at me, "I trust you too, and I wouldn't want that." He says.</p> <p>I can't help but smile at him and say, "Thank you," as I continue to nod my head and turn my head to look at him and smile.</p> <p>After lunch, we do our thing. We do our jobs on a weekly basis. While working for Mr. K, I will usually wear a skirt or top on occasion; he likes to see me dressed up in a skirt and top with no underwear underneath. During the week, I wear panties underneath everything. My mom is usually not aware of this but I don't care. All I want to do is make the perfect employee and I'm happy to do that. However, there is one thing I really like. I like it when he sits there and I can't stop looking at his face as he eyes me.</p> <p>"So," Mr. K says, "are you hungry?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm hungry." I answer.</p> <p>"Come on in. I'm just going to the bathroom so you can use the bathroom. I'll put some dinner in for later."</p> <p>We follow him into the bathroom. While I get the toiletries bag, he sits down and says,</p> <p>"Ok, let's get this dinner started."</p> <p>As I kneel back down, I try to ignore him. He stands up and tells me "I was about to sit down and call you to come get dinner."</p> <p>"Thanks, I'll get up," I say.</p> <p>When I walk him to the front door, he opens the door. I stand up and head to the kitchen as he starts to make some dinner for us. As he walks away, I feel like I'm walking down a dark dirt road. I know if I don't stop now, I'm never going to get out of this one. Before I know it, the dinner is ready and the wine started pouring. We chatted during this while talking about our past and I can't tell you exactly what we talked about. I was still pretty horny but was beginning to worry about my own well being.</p> <p>I'm finally feeling very comfortable and can move about in my robe as the rest of the people come by to find us. I'm very quiet and the conversation seems to get a little less intimate.</p> <p>I feel this man's hand touch my thigh as we sit down. He asks me if I've been getting laid for the past couple of days. I reply with a shrug and smile, "Not really."</p> <p>He then asks if I've been doing anything naughty with my husband. I shake my head, "Not really," but my pussy tingling in anticipation. I then feel a pair of hands on each thigh and I'm shocked when I hear his voice.</p> <p>"Is the wine cool?" He asks as he walks over to a side table.</p> <p>My heart pounds as I'm looking at the wine.
