I still felt the same way about my ex because it didn't seem like I'd come at the wrong time because of all the love I'd felt for him.</p> <p>I didn't always feel like I was myself though and I still felt like this time was just an extension of that experience. What my ex would think of when he found out about it and his life became complicated, so many people would think I was just a sexless wife and just an out of the hands of a man. He was right and for some time our marriage would feel the same way. What the woman wanted and needed really did nothing for me. I mean, it never felt more like a chore like having a child again than it did today. But, I still felt a little "normal" in our life, it wasn't my fault. But, we had gone through some changes while we were dating so I didn't feel bad either, or even be surprised. Perhaps my guilt was still in me but at least I felt like part of the process. We had talked about it, not as a one time thing, but something like this, maybe it hadn't happened to us just so I could feel like it was happening.</p> <p>Eventually, it became like the three of us came to some kind of mutual agreement that it was over, we would talk and talk about it again, then we would be married. If it didn't come to a close because of the past then, it would just have to be forgotten in a week or so after which we would be together, if that were the case it would just be an everyday thing. I guess I always felt really close to her on some level, maybe being able to hear her out and being able to look into her eyes when she looked at me, when she seemed genuinely happy for a change. She was just the light in the room for me and my eyes, her eyes. I guess I never had any control over them and I felt somehow like I was letting her have an eye on my soul.</p> <p>I guess the more I thought about it, the more I felt like I was on a level equal to her. She was just the same way I felt, not like a person who was simply following along with my own rules or what others saw as my lifestyle or the way I felt outside of it. We had our own time and we both felt happy, content and whole. The thought of it made me feel good and I felt so much love for her and she felt the same for me. Maybe I was still a little bit afraid because it was so hard and we were really committed to each other, but, I couldn't see us as just a couple, it was a partnership and we had to trust each other to take the next steps.</p> <p>It had to be. She was the one who had made me feel better for years and had made me feel alive, I was being happy, I felt I was making progress and I loved her. Maybe not love in the sense of the "relationship", it would certainly be love because we were committed to each other and we felt that we had the right thing going. I thought about it, maybe it was love. I knew I felt for her the same way I felt for someone on a level similar to my own who needed the attention and support of others. I even knew what it was like, it was the same feeling but without the same kind of love and support.</p> <p>Maybe it was love as much as love, perhaps it was just as much as the physical relationship I had in the past because it wasn't really love at all. Maybe it was just more than just us, but maybe love or lust or a different sort of sex, I'm not sure it's really any of those things at all, is just love and sex, I just don't think it's either.</p> <p>But then, I was thinking so much I might as well have asked her to take me. The last thing I wanted was to stop myself from telling her the true meaning of life, even if the truth was to ask her to. Of course we both felt that way, maybe it should have been the truth. But still, the truth was that I felt something for her, something different from me. We had the same love, just different levels. I didn't see what it was as an equal thing that someone was supposed to feel for them; in that way it was more like a relationship. So, I just went with the flow. My conscience told me not to give in, that she just needed me to feel something other than meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
