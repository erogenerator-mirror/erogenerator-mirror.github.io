If I call you down for a kiss. If you call me down, I will remove something. The game is to begin. If I call you up, the loser is the last to kiss me for twenty minutes. Sound fair," he added with a laugh.</p> <p>She hesitated, then nodded slightly. She looked at him, and asked, "How come you said the game was fair, I could kiss you?"</p> <p>He frowned at her, suddenly understanding, "I'm not saying if the kiss is fair, but what does it matter? It's my choice."</p> <p>She hesitated again, her heart pounding a bit, and asked, "I'm not sure I'll be ok kissing you."</p> <p>She could feel the color rising in her cheeks, and the moisture pooling between her legs.</p> <p>"Surely you're not all that upset about me being with another woman?" He asked her, but a very puzzled look was on his face.</p> <p>She quickly took control of the conversation, "Why would I be upset that you're with a woman?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, that's just it. You, in fact, have the only part of your anatomy exposed. Not that either of us will blame you for that. It isn't anything I did because I didn't know how to proceed," he explained.</p> <p>He had no idea who the hell she was, or how she got on this stupid trip of hers, but he was grateful that he was sitting across from her and she hadn't been wearing any panties. "Really? And where do we go from here?" he asked.</p> <p>"Anywhere you want, I'll play along. Here, hold this," he added as he grabbed a box of tissues and placed it next to his lap. She handed him a couple of and set it aside. When he handed her the box, she tossed her hand away, "This won't last very long, if you don't mind, but I'll be good. You can use some of the tissues to dry you off."</p> <p>While she had only been looking at that box of tissues, she had unbuttoned a few buttons of her blouse and was wearing a lovely bra. She quickly pulled her blouse out of reach, then held out her hand.</p> <p>"Let's do it together," she urged, looking down at his lap. "It's been awhile, I'm afraid."</p> <p>He reached out his other hand and helped her get her arms back under her.</p> <p>"Are you ok?" he asked her as he helped her to her feet.</p> <p>She nodded as she reached the door, "I'm very well, I'm sure. The last thing I need is for you to run and find someone else to do for me," she smiled, then looked away. "Thank you, for your help."</p> <p>She paused a moment, then smiled at him, "Thank you. It was my pleasure."</p> <p>His expression changed, she found. His eyes went wide, then closed to the music.</p> <p>"That's it?" she suddenly asked him.</p> <p>"Yeah," he replied. "Is that what this is all about, and don't you dare say anything?"</p> <p>"I'm not saying I'm not turned on by the idea, and it is kind of nice to start, especially since you have no idea what to do with it."</p> <p>She turned to leave, but when he grabbed a Kleenex from the box, she closed and turned back, "But, I want to make you happyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
