I'm just glad you finally remembered I was still your woman and I had made the right decision that night."</p> <p>"You always make the best decisions in the morning."</p> <p>"That's because that was how you made those choices about my body and everything else."</p> <p>"Damn, this is just so perfect. You did the right thing in letting me see that perfect body that you were aching to show off."</p> <p>"If it isn't our time."</p> <p>"Let's put that thought out of your head for now."</p> <p>"I guess what would that do is set another example by some other people. I like you, but I was a jerk yesterday so there isn't that much going on here. I'm going to head on home and get dressed and we can hit the sack. It's a lot to take in, but at least I can take care of something. I really enjoyed myself today."</p> <p>"Me, too. When you said you hadn't been able to hold back, I thought you would be able to handle my cock like you did with mine."</p> <p>"That's true. When you were trying, I couldn't hold it back and I came in about five minutes."</p> <p>"I have to take that as another of your comments."</p> <p>She giggled and said, "I told you it wasn't funny."</p> <p>"That's another of my comments."</p> <p>They finished dressing and went to work on the office again. After the work day was over, she and John went home and told their wives they would have to meet with the managers again to discuss the contract. All the employees went home that day as well while the new office staff went home for the weekend.</p> <p>Over the next four months, their marriage came to an end. It was over but it had the potential to be great again. They remained married and enjoyed their life together. There were a couple of changes there and she found that she loved the other man more and more. If they were having sex, he would make it easier to maintain their relationship. For a while, there was just a light banter around the apartment. He would say things about her and how happy she was. She was a little confused by his comment about their sex life. She had already had two orgasms in her entire marriage.</p> <p>The next time she was seeing him, he was waiting for her when she got home. It was a Friday and she was going to work in the morning. "What are you doing home?" she asked.</p> <p>"If you want to leave, you can stay at my place if you want, but that will cause a little tension in the marriage."</p> <p>"The tension between you and this other guy is too good."</p> <p>"Well that's one reason why we are both so jealous. I don't want you getting jealous. Besides, after last weekend, there is a real chance we'll have another chance. I know it, I can feel it. I know it."</p> <p>"Well, you're right. I don't want that pressure back."</p> <p>"Well, that is something I can't believe I am feeling."</p> <p>He took her in his arms and kissed her, his hand moving down to her ass cheeks and down to find her clit, which was still swollen, as he continued to rub it.</p> <p>"Does that feel good, my love? Does it please you?"</p> <p>"It makes me feel great. You do that so well."</p> <p>"I never had a man touch me like that."</p> <p>"You should see that. When he did that to me, I thought that you were going to cum. It kind of ticked me off that you were getting close before you did."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to cum until it was over. I just couldn't hold on. I don't have a lot of inhibitions left and I didn't think I would be able to hold off long. I did like it, but I'm really sensitive down there now and it was really nice for a few moments."</p> <p>"You weren't sensitive down there, right?"</p> <p>"You know, it is kind of sexy. Even though I was cumming, it was a little after I got myself off. I think about it sometimes, but it seems like it never happens."</p> <p>"Well, it is kind of fun to touch some guy like that."</p> <p>"You are saying that I was feeling something down there?"</p> <p>"Well, yes and no. I wouldn't do it on purpose. If I was doing it, maybe it would turn you on if she touched me in a sexual way."</p> <p>"Are you going to touch me again?"</p> <p>"No. I am going to touch you until I feel you cum again. I don't want to hurt youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
