I am sure that she had mentioned that she had to call. She had been on a meeting. I know that she thought that we had been discussing her divorce.</p> <p>I was waiting for the call. At any other time I would have asked Beth. For a minute it felt like our life couldn't get any better. Yet here I was.</p> <p>As soon as her call was made and we were about to hang up a piece of paper fell into my lap. I picked it up. It had a number printed in the margins above it. I looked at it. The numbers were about right. If Beth wrote back to me she would find it for me.</p> <p>She called.</p> <p>"Hi Beth!"</p> <p>"Hey, who was on the phone?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry that I rang you up today."</p> <p>"It's okay. It's just that there was very little left to talk about. I guess that it was only a matter of time."</p> <p>"Yeah. It was really stressful. It got us both in trouble."</p> <p>"But I was able to get into a better place today than I do in the past."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too!"</p> <p>And we held each other. We sat together for a long time. It was not like it was the first time. When we had to get up from the table to go to the ladies room, we were going through the door to our bathroom. It was an accident that we did not hear the door open.</p> <p>I have to admit that I was excited. We were in a bathroom. I had a quickie with her before she needed to go to the room to clean up. She still took the panties with her. I did not know what to expect.</p> <p>We kissed in the bathroom. Nothing had been said until we got out of the bathroom. Beth had already changed into a robe and I was changing into a bathing suit. We went into the bedroom and got undressed. I was standing when she came out of the bathroom.</p> <p>"I have an idea for a surprise for you."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"Have a bath now." She took out a robe and handed it me. It was white and soft. It was long. She put it on and we climbed in to the tub.</p> <p>"I have an idea. Just lay back and relax."</p> <p>"You are evil," I teased.</p> <p>"No, I'm not."</p> <p>She got in the tub with me and the water was good. Just a little of my sperm. I washed her. She washed mine and we got in the tub together. We kissed so many times that the water came out almost of us. By the time that we got out to dry off we were kissing. Nothing was spoken. I could have sworn that I had kissed her mouth. She didn't say a word. We both got up out of the tub and grabbed another towel. We dried ourselves. We walked out to the main room of the house.</p> <p>"What is this, a surprise?"</p> <p>"Beth, it could be anything."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Let's get the surprise and you can go to the big surprise."</p> <p>Beth got up and followed me in to the kitchen. We were standing by the island and we looked at each other and I could tell that Beth was feeling the same kind of emotion. The moment when I had the surprise came like a freight train. It hit her. I could hear how much she was feeling.</p> <p>"It's time for dessert."</p> <p>"What kind of dinner?"</p> <p>"It's nothing like the big surprise I was talking to the other day at dinner."</p> <p>"Maybe it is time we had a little snack too."</p> <p>I laughed and got up. She followed me into the kitchen. When she came out behind me I handed her the bowl of ice cream. "This is the main desert. You don't have to do much. I only have to help a friend while she is being whipped."</p> <p>I started making the vanilla vanilla crepes and then she said to my surprise, "What is that sound?"</p> <p>"Just something that you do to me?"</p> <p>We laughed. I made her serve me with my hands, while we ate. When all the crepes and ice cream were gone and we had eaten, Beth asked. "When I go to bed tonight I'm going to get you."</p> <p>"I will always be ready for you when you get up."</p> <p>Weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
