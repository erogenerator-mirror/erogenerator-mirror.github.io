"I just don't get it you're not going to fuck around."</p> <p>I looked up and was shocked to see this man standing in the middle of my bedroom. His hand was up he was stroking his cock.</p> <p>"Just fuck me."</p> <p>"What? Now? You want to get naked? Here?"</p> <p>"Get off the bed before I change my mind."</p> <p>"What the fuck, dude?"</p> <p>"Don't you fucking dare!" he yelled.</p> <p>"Sorry, sorry I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No fucking way!" And I did mean that, but it was no use because I just went to the closet, pulled out this strap on dildo and walked naked back to him and dropped to my knees in front of him and grabbed the dildo from his hands and began to play with it and talk to him while I licked the head before sliding down his cock and sliding in and out of my mouth while I was telling him off. As far as I knew, no one could have a relationship like that and no matter what I was doing, he enjoyed it and he wanted me to suck him, especially if he was paying. By the time I pulled the strap on dildo from his hands, he was almost shaking. I pushed him back on the bed and climbed up over his body, rubbing my pussy along the length of his cock, which he had already began to throb, sliding into my wet hole from behind.</p> <p>"God, you're so fucking good at that," he groaned.</p> <p>I smiled to him, bent over and took him deep into my mouth to suck, licking and teasing him. When he grabbed my bare ass cheeks. We fucked every day.</p> <p>"Hey."</p> <p>He looked up at me, smiled and grabbed my hips.</p> <p>"Come on. Let's switch places."</p> <p>He looked me up and down before I turned around and kissed him. He ran his hands through my hair while his erection rubbed me and I started to grind his hard cock against him, his hand reaching down and playing with my pussy. He rubbed my clit, and I moaned. He rubbed his finger up and down my pussy and played with my ass, sliding his finger around and rubbing my asshole. He put 2 fingers in me and rubbed them back and forth, then pulled his hands out and shoved his fingers up my ass, causing me to moan again. When he pulled his fingers out, I knew this was going to happen. Once he came in me, I came in his hand. I felt dizzy and dizzy, with only one reason of cumming, being able to move his hand away from my clit. He was holding my hips and I was on the brink. The feel and smell of my juice coating his fingers was as much a turn on as all that and he slid into me in one hard thrust, giving my own orgasm more pleasure. When I came, he did too. "You like that? You like the feel of my cumming in you?" he asked me, still buried in me.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He pulled out of me and came on my stomach, some of it running down into my ass crack. He scooped up some and rubbed it into my cunt and my clit and, when I was close again, just slid it down and up, rubbing his fingers back and forth in my pussy again, the last cum dripping from my cunt. I opened my eyes, saw his cum on my stomach, my breasts and body and I licked it up.</p> <p>"Fuck me."</p> <p>He smiled and I turned around and got on my hands and knees as he stood up. He was still hard and in the position he was in, even without getting into the position in the dream he just fucked me in, I was ready for more. I wanted more. I spread my legs and put a hand on his butt.</p> <p>"You need to fuck me. I always dreamed that I could have a body like yours, but now I'm feeling like a fucking machine. You're my fucking lover, you know."</p> <p>"Good. You ready for your ride?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes. Let's fuck,"</p> <p>"Are you sure?" He asked, a big smile across his face.</p> <p>"Yeah. I'm sure."</p> <p>"Good. Now, turn around."</p> <p>I turned, facing away from him, my back toward the wall and my legs splayed, my ass sticking straight up and my body in the air.</p> <p>"Spread your legs," he ordered, a little harder this time.</p> <p>I did because I wanted him to fuck me, knowing that it was only about twenty minutes before weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
