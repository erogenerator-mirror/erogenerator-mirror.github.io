"I'm sorry, that's all. I really did go overboard, I really want to get in touch with you, but I just can't." She was looking very distressed.</p> <p>"But do you really really think—"</p> <p>"It's not what you think," she insisted. "I just don't know what a girl would do to be honest with her boyfriend. It doesn't matter that it's his best friend's fantasy, he's my boy, my little fuck-toy! I'm sorry, but I don't have to do this."</p> <p>"Really, baby, I understand," I said. "I mean, it's not that bad, we've been friends for a while, but I really need to go see my parents next week."</p> <p>"Okay," she said, finally putting her arm around me. She took the tissue box off the counter as I left. I thought about going and hanging out with the other girls, but I figured I'd just go home, have a shower, and spend the next few days alone. I knew then that it was totally okay for me to go, but I'd already told her I wanted to make love to him and then move on a few weeks later. She really was a great little girl, so I didn't want to ruin her for anyone else, and there were a number of girls around, too. She was just too young to understand that just by seeing him that would just make her want to marry him.</p> <p>I drove away a couple of days later. This had been the best week I'd had in a long time and when I got home that evening it was going to take a long long time to get through to my little girl. He couldn't possibly be my boyfriend. That's just the thing! He was just too old for us. He wasn't any younger than sixteen, but it was still wrong to do what he did! I just couldn't believe how it was going to turn out.</p> <p>I took a shower after my shower and took a little time to think, to sort out what I could do to go home and face the music. I'm not sure why I was so scared that it would make me the kind of guy that would want to spend some time with a girl who had a boyfriend? It was all new to me, and I guess I just felt that it meant what it would mean for me. It might even mean that everything would go well for me.</p> <p>The next day after my first class I took a quick look at one of the ads at the front of the book store. I read another and then sat down in front of it. I had to admit to myself that the ads were a little off. I looked around the store for my car and saw that there a few cars there. I was surprised and embarrassed. I mean, I thought the girls in the ads on the screen were kidding and I shouldn't have seen that! But that didn't stop me. I mean, what do you want to do with an eighteen year-old kid? I mean, my own age! But there were lots of boys around, but where was my boy friend? Oh, well, let's see!</p> <p>I went up to my parents' house to pick a suit to wear and there he was. He looked just like a little boy, just a little boy. He must be a lot older than I had, as his hair was just a little longer than mine. He had curly blonde wavy hair. He had big freckles all over his face and back. He looked just like a boy. His little boy face looked to be in my dreams, as he kept glancing at me throughout the day as he talked to his friend's mom. I didn't know what I thought, but just then I decided to just go over and say hello to him all of a sudden. Maybe I wasn't so foolish after all. Maybe I should go in and say hi to my friend's mother, just to say hello to him that way.</p> <p>I said hi to him and his buddy, Jake, a little after Jake had told Jake how I was sitting down with them in the living room of my parent's house, and about that little incident I overheard when I got home that I hadn't really thought of that before. But Jake was right, after that I was going all the time in my mind.</p> <p>My parents were going for a little run-down house, too. I had the feeling that this would be the closest thing the girls had ever let us get together. I figured if I couldn't have any of them that I might as well just go ahead and have my little girls' night out. I mean, what difference can a girl make in a place like that anyway, anyway?</p> <p>My mom and dad gave me a big hug, and I just hugged them back.
