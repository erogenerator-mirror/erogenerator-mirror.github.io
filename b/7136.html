He took her chin in his palm, and lowered her mouth on his nipple. They kissed gently at first, but with urgency, and then harder.</p> <p>His hand traveled her body, over her back, from her neck down to the small of her back, his finger reaching beneath her. He explored, dipped his fingers into her pussy, pressing against the tight, firm ring of her anus. She moaned into the kiss, feeling his hardness rubbing against her. God, that would feel so good when he slid into her. She had so much better things to do that soon, and that wouldn't be so bad.</p> <p>"So, I have a bit of a surprise for you, won't I?" he said softly, moving his mouth from hers, his fingers still moving beneath her.</p> <p>"Mmm," she said, her voice a moan of pleasure, and she felt it press upward. He had his fingers inside her now, and she couldn't help but moan into his kiss.</p> <p>"And what is that?" he whispered, lowering himself down to kiss her mouth as his fingers worked her insides.</p> <p>"I think it's time for me to make love," she whispered once again, and he moved on top of her once again. He positioned himself again, placing his body over hers. She lay back, leaning against him, and he kissed her again.</p> <p>Slowly, his hardness slid inside her. She wrapped her arms around him, feeling their bodies pressed against each other.</p> <p>He looked deeply into her eyes. "You're so beautiful," he said softly.</p> <p>"And you're so hard!" she said, smiling at him. "Mmm. Yes. Very!"</p> <p>He lifted his head slightly, looked at her, and then back at her again. "Do you really like this?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Mmm-hmmmm!" She responded. "Yes. A lot! Especially after what we just shared earlier."</p> <p>"Then I need to make this last some more," he said. "It's been a lot of fun getting to know you. I can't remember the last time we did this together."</p> <p>"I'm glad we did," she said, "because I'm more in love with you right now than I've been in a long, long time. I feel like I could've died with happiness with you. It seems like my whole world is falling apart apart at the moment."</p> <p>"Do we ever learn to do this?" he said. "It's one of the ways I know how to make you happy."</p> <p>"Can you teach me?" she asked, moving her legs apart. "I love everything about our relationship."</p> <p>He lifted himself a little bit, then lowered himself again. "Are you sure?" he said softly.</p> <p>"Oh, God. Yes," she said, closing her eyes. "It doesn't matter," she heard herself say.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to go this far?" he said. "To have our last time together?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said, and he lifted himself up a bit, then lifted himself completely off her once more. He was on his feet next to the bed, and he looked down at her body as he came back to her. With his arms wrapped round her, he pulled her down to him. He kissed her cheek again, then her mouth, and then her neck again as his hard cock pressed against her.</p> <p>"I'm not saying anything," she said softly, her voice almost too low to be heard over the kiss. "I'm not going anywhere!"</p> <p>"Not with you," he said, his voice breaking a little. "We can't do anything like that again. Not with each other."</p> <p>"Why not?" she asked.</p> <p>"Because," he said, a bit louder this time, "if you're going to be with anyone, we're going to have to learn how to do this again."</p> <p>She leaned closer to him, and felt his erection press against her thigh. "Then I want to know that you will," she said, "when we're together. And there will be more. I've never wanted to do anything as much as I want to do with you again."</p> <p>"I love you," he breathed, and then he kissed her again, their lips opening to receive each others' tongue. They were sharing their passion and the feelings they shared as they made love.</p> <p>"And I love you," she said again, then she felt him slide his hardness out of her slowlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
