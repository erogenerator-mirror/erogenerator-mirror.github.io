I asked</p> <p>"If I was looking for your friend, I would just drop him off here and meet him here and then come in with you," she replied</p> <p>I stood up and moved towards her, "I will take that for granted, but I would really like to talk to you first before we go any further."</p> <p>"Ok." she replied "You go put your clothes on and follow me back to the beach house." I nodded back and followed my wife, who was still wearing her robe. We walked for about 30 minutes before we came to the beach house. There was someone waiting outside waiting and when we finally got inside I told the stranger to follow me in. After I closed the door, he followed me towards a small bathroom area. My wife walked into the bathroom, then entered with flowers. We sat down on the small couch, and told each other we were ready to talk. My wife turned on her heels and entered to tell us, "I need to tell you something that you shouldn't disturb unless you are ready."</p> <p>"What," I asked her</p> <p>"Do something," she replied, "I think your friend would like to have some time alone with you." I didn't say anything but my cock was already straining against my jeans. My wife turned on her stereo and pulled out a few music videos. We watched one for almost 20 minutes. The two of us watched each other masturbating, each of us bringing ourselves to climax. My wife got on all fours, placed her head on the couch and spread her legs.</p> <p>"Get on your knees," she told me. Her ass was inviting. I had always fantasized about this.</p> <p>I obeyed and entered my wife pussy from behind.</p> <p>"Your friend is on the couch, watching the TV." I could feel her pussy tightening around my cock. "Your friend will enjoy what his friend may get. He can get a taste of your juices as well."</p> <p>"Is he coming here to watch you," I asked her</p> <p>"Yes," she replied. I slowly fucked her, watching every move. My wife closed her eyes as she got close to orgasm. I slowed my fucking, then pulled out of her.</p> <p>"I am almost there," I told her. I walked over to a bag nearby and got out a rubber I had taken from a trash bag. I walked up to my wife, kissed her as I slipped the rubber on my cock. When she opened her eyes to see what I was doing, I was ready to show her what she had been missing for months. She sat astride me and we started fucking. My wife was watching every movement I made and she loved looking at my face as I went in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>"You've got a big cock," she said, as I fucked her harder</p> <p>"Does it feel good when you're inside me?" I asked</p> <p>"Your friend's cock is huge," she said, with a little laugh</p> <p>"Yeah," I moaned</p> <p>"That feels good, but yours is so big," she replied, as I pumped into her harder. I could feel that I was about to blow. This time without realizing it I pushed my cock as far into my wife as I could and started jerking my own cock and spraying her insides with my sperm. We both moaned. My wife's pussy tightened around my cock, as her juices ran down my cock and out the sides.</p> <p>"Ohhh. Ahhh," she moaned, as I emptied my load into her.</p> <p>"Was that a good fuck?" I asked</p> <p>"Sure was."</p> <p>"I just want to show you how special a guy this is."</p> <p>"You're serious?" I asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely." She said, still smiling.</p> <p>I had a hard time trying to catch my breath after that. It was about 3 months later that she told me that her friend's name was James. I had gotten my cock out again just after she had told me this. I found out that I was in fact married to my wife. I couldn't help it.</p> <p>One of the last things that she wanted me to do was to give her a massage. I agreed, but she got upset. "If you do that for me, I will forget you ever saw James" she said, with a pouty face</p> <p>"Ok," I said to her</p> <p>I told her to lie down on her stomach, with her head in her hands and her ass up in the air. She got me a small pillow, and turned over. I put my cock, and started massaging her thighs. My wife's moans and sighs indicated that she was enjoying the massage. I massaged her entire body from feet to belly button. I took both of her breasts in my hands andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
