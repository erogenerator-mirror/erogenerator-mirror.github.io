He reaches up and caresses your cheek gently. You kiss his cheek and neck gently and then he leans back, leaning against the wall. You walk slowly over to him, your body tight. You move around in front of him, standing close to him, your hands sliding to his chest. They kiss gently. Your hips make a slow circle around against his crotch, rubbing and teasing, sending a small amount of excitement through his body that only starts when your hands slip up to his nipples and massage them slowly. His eyes are closed and his chest heaving. You slowly undo his jeans and help him out of them. You kiss his neck slowly, rubbing your breasts against him. He moans softly and your body continues rubbing the soft cotton of his underwear. He slides his hands down your back and slides under your nightie, pushing it up over your ass and down your thighs to your feet. You step out of his jeans and his briefs slide onto the floor. He puts his hands on your hips again and kisses his way up your shoulder to your lips. Slowly you kiss your way up to his ear. You gently move your body into his, allowing his erection to touch your pelvis.</p> <p>You bend your knees slightly and step out of his boxers. You slide your hands down his chest and stomach, feeling his hips move involuntarily as you go. Your hands move down his body to his cock and you slowly wrap your fingers around it, rubbing your palm upward slowly. Slowly you move your hand up the shaft of his cock, running your fingers over his head, feeling the softness of his skin and you push the head into your fingers. He gasps quietly before his hands are on your body. You turn to face him, holding your head in front of his. You look at one of your toes and smile, letting your eyes drop to the tip of his cock and back up. You bend down and take him in your mouth, making little sucking motions on his head with your lips. You slowly move to your knees and sit in front of him; slowly taking his cock deep into your mouth, running your tongue around his length. You feel your wetness and see that your juices are starting to run down your legs by now. Your fingers find his balls, feeling his sack and then gently stroking him in your hand. You smile again and look him in the eyes as you slip him from your mouth. You raise your head, looking down at him. You take his head in your mouth, running your tongue on its underside. Then your eyes go back to his face as you kiss him, his mouth meeting hers. You gently ease him from your mouth and bring him back to your mouth. You run your tongue over his lips, slowly sliding it over his lower lip. You slowly pull away and look around. You smile in his eyes as you smile back at him, slowly running her fingertips up past his cheek. You sit back on the bed, pulling him down in front of you. You sit back, crossing your legs at the ankles. His eyes lock with yours as you run your fingernail over his cock through his trousers. You turn and sit back on your heels, smiling. You put your hands to your face and brush your nails over your lips, then slowly lower them to your chest. Your fingers slide on the wet fabric of your bra and they meet on your skin. You lift it and your eyes meet his and you know you want him. You slide the bra up and let it fall down your arms, your breasts exposed. You turn around so he could see they and he looks at you, then back at his pants.</p> <p>His eyes are back on you and you grin and slowly run your hands down your arms. Then around to your breasts, gently caressing them with the back of your hands. Your nipples harden as the heat between you grows within your belly. You push your breasts out to him, offering them to his hands, taking his hands and placing them on either side of your stomach, giving him a little squeeze. You lay back down and let his hands run up and over your thigh, the fabric of your panties tickling your skin. You spread your legs slightly, allowing his touch to run between them.</p> <p>You run your hands down your stomach and back up, over your waist. He smiles again at you and slowly runs one finger down your slit. As he feels you wet, he slips his finger inside you. You moan your pleasure as he flicks his finger in and out, causing you to arch up once, then again, moaning again the pleasure. He slides his finger slightly out just before you climax, and you look at him, your face slightly puffy from your enjoyment and desire. You move down and take his cock in your mouth. you lick slowly and run your tongue around the head of his cock. You let your head rest on the bed, taking his cock deep into your mouth as you strokeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
