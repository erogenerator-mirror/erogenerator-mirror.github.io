I guess we went for the whole summer. I had a girl's swim meet, and they both had sex with me. And we had drinks a little before I left. After dinner we had some late dancing on the floor, and she got very wild and got very aggressive for me...I could feel her cumming pretty hard when we were dancing."</p> <p>I had actually enjoyed this, and I had to admit I was really excited to try it again with some of my friends. I felt a little embarrassed and a little excited myself. I really wasn't into guys, and hadn't done anything in awhile.</p> <p>"Honey, I want you to see how it's going to go. My cock is hard because of talking about her, and I can't do anything with you...I'm sorry. That's okay. Tell you what...I know you like girls, right?" I was a little worried about him, and really wanted to know more, but then realized he was married.</p> <p>He laughed and said, "Yeah, well, you're married...not, well, it doesn't have to be. But if something should happen just tell me." She smiled and said she would tell him later.</p> <p>I got my panties and skirt back on and we went back to our room. I put my skirt back on as I got out of the car. I couldn't even remember where we were, or how much time we had spent in the car, or when we had gotten back to the room. We were the only ones there.</p> <p>We kissed like that for a long time, our tongues wrestling and probing for each other. Then he got up and said he had to go, and walked toward the door. I looked right at him and said, "I don't know if I still want to do this, but if you are, that's okay, it's okay." I turned to him and gave him a big kiss and said, "Thank you for letting me know, and for inviting me for this." He smiled and said that sounded like his answer.</p> <p>I kissed him for a minute before he pulled his wet face away and headed into the bathroom. I watched as he came out with this big hard-on. I knew for sure that he had a girlfriend, and so did most of his friends, and I wondered if she was still in the bathroom. He had just walked by me when I walked by and said, "She'll just have to wait until you get back to the hotel."</p> <p>He left to go in the other room, leaving me standing there like a little girl who just got caught in the middle of an erotic fantasy. And I found myself excited thinking about what was going to happen.</p> <p>My boyfriend had never touched me down there, so that was new. I know she has never touched it, and I hadn't really explored it yet...but I am sure that she had done a LOT while we were married. I was sure she touched herself while I would go down on her, and I was sure I knew what she liked. But being her boyfriend, he was her first male sexual partner too, so he didn't feel the need to ask. And he liked it more when I would give my boyfriend a blowjob, than he normally did in a minute.</p> <p>"Well," he said "My girlfriend didn't leave so much as come in this morning, did she?" And that turned me on some.</p> <p>I asked if he had ever cum just from me having one orgasm, and if she had ever gotten off from it. "No...I think I've had about four, but she wouldn't tell me they were 'two'." He laughed out loud. Then he smiled and said it seemed to be the best way to explain what had happened. He took off his shirt and told me to watch him, but not to touch him anywhere else. I was afraid that was just one of his "guy stuff" things, and I had not done anything else.</p> <p>So now, here I was standing in the hotel room, a naked, nearly naked, 18 year-old male, with my boyfriend standing before me. I could feel my excitement. I couldn't look him in the eye, my eyes still locked on his. But I was sure now that I could see a tent in his pants and his cock pressing against his boxer briefs, and it was obvious that my nervousness had diminished a little.</p> <p>"I need to be more comfortable." I said. He seemed surprised.</p> <p>I slid out of the panties that had been hanging down on my crotch as I walked over to him. I kissed him on the cheek and said, "I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
