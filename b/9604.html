At the rate that I'm going to go on this trip, it will be even sexier." To say that she was a "slurper" would be an understatement. The way that she'd spoken to him was the epitome of "slurper."</p> <p>"Oh yeah I thought that you were such a slut that I'd find ways to dress that slutty with a little help," He laughed.</p> <p>"Well, there is a way that I can assist in providing a bit of inspiration for you," she said, "let me tell you why I'm in trouble," and she stepped forward and leaned right in front of him. She moved just behind him and reached a hand down, placing it gently on his cock and squeezing it through his pants. Her eyes were on fire. She looked up at him as she brought the tip of his cock to her lips and lightly kissed it before she ran her tongue over the tip. In that moment, he felt like he was about to blow a load right then. She took the head into her mouth and sucked on it, licking the underside of it, pulling slightly away and then down a little as he held nothing back so that she could really taste how good it was to have him close to her mouth as it went all the way down her throat. As it moved lower, her hair fell around him and her lips pressed firmly to the base of his cock.</p> <p>His first load erupted from him and he couldn't hold it at bay much longer. He felt like he needed to be on the verge of a violent release rather than a little over excited. He released a huge load right into her mouth just as she looked up at him and smiled, then she quickly leaned down so that only a few drops of his cum landed on her face with the next load. She looked up at him and then up at him again. He saw the mischief in her eyes, even though she was still looking him directly in the eyes.</p> <p>"Did that feel good?" she smiled.</p> <p>"Yeah, it did," he said.</p> <p>"I can taste myself," she said. He just about lost it there. She leaned back a little, pulled his cock from her mouth and leaned down so that her mouth was right next to it. She was still holding onto his cock so her lips could touch the tip. "It was the best taste I've ever had in my mouth. How can anything better taste that?" she said.</p> <p>"Well, you definitely know what it tastes like," he chuckled.</p> <p>"You're still hard," she said.</p> <p>She kept smiling as she moved back on the bed and crawled onto the floor, straddling his legs as she sat on his thigh. "I've been doing this for a while, but I just haven't had anything to stick it into," she said.</p> <p>"It doesn't seem like it will," he said and ran his hand up her thigh. "That's right," she said. With that, she sat straight up so that she had a better angle of him where he could stick it in her. She was a little nervous about it, but for the most part, it felt like it was what he needed. She got up on her knees, facing him, and leaned forward so that her hands were going to hold onto something. His hands went to her knees and he pushed her legs apart as far as he could. He slid into her with one steady thrust and started to go really deep at a very slow pace. Every time that he hit bottom, she pushed her hips back trying to get him to go deeper. His hand went to her clit and he started to stroke it as he started to fuck her. Her hands went to his balls and started to squeeze them slightly. The pace of her actions had picked up and he knew that he was hitting the right spot. He slowed down, but kept going. His dick was beginning to throb against her leg and he felt her body start to tense up a little. He knew that she was going to cum soon and he could feel it. She was moving her hips back and forth in a slow, rhythmic motion that he liked. Her face was turning a deep red and it looked as if she was getting ready to pass out. He increased his pace slightly until they bumped together.</p> <p>"You feel so good baby," he said.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that feels good," she said as she came back down. He let go of her clit and wrapped both hands around her waist and started to rub both of her clits in unison. The combination of what she just got done brought her to orgasm faster than she had started and as much as he wanted to hold back, he wanted her to cum again. He started to fuck her quicker and faster andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
