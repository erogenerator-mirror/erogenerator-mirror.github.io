For now maybe I should put that story alone. I might get another chance if I just give the story a chance. What about you?</p> <p>Alessa’s Story In the first place, I was still not sure about him, or, about sex with him, with my wife in the way that we had with my wife, with her naked, and I had seen her with others, and with my own hands, my fingers, and sometimes with others, in the way I had seen her with another man, or with her husband. Now, I was sure, I had seen my own version of her.</p> <p>But if I had said yes, and done all this for her, and given her the choice, and taken care of it if she chose, then what? There was nothing I could do about it, I could’ve stopped this, the way I felt like I did when I was in college, and in my own mind, I might as well have, in my own way, to let the world decide it’s own course, the way it would.</p> <p>But I was now in the presence of an old friend. His name was Jack, and my husband had died in a car accident when I was still in college. I never would have done anything and I certainly never would have taken another lover, or ever had sex with anyone who didn’t deserve it, if it wasn’t too good for someone, and who owed him that.</p> <p>But I had no intention of doing it, and neither had he, in fact the idea, the choice, of what to do it again, of doing it to my friend, of all this had always taken place in my mind. I couldn’t even consider taking it further, the idea of being with someone else. I would rather not have to feel like that, but I had to do it for her.</p> <p>In truth, for some reason I did it, and I suppose it wouldn’t even have meant that much, and for her, too. She said yes, to whatever, as long as she enjoyed it. This seemed to be the price of her choice. I could have, I would have done anything, to have him. Even fuck again, and make her happy if that was what it took to finally get his old car and get her, and make her happy, even now. If she didn’t like that idea, she could leave, and maybe get a job, and maybe get back on the road again. That didn’t mean I would be satisfied as a man of the world.</p> <p>But there was only one way to do it, and that was to ask for nothing.</p> <p>To be continued—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
