She was flushed and her hair was disheveled by the damp towel on her head. But she was smiling when she leaned over to pick up her clothes while keeping her legs together. She pulled her legs together, and the towel fell off of her. I was left with only one thing to hold onto and stare at as she turned to head for the bathroom.</p> <p>She quickly got up, pulled her pants up and she walked out with a slight giggle. "What do you think? Do you like it?"</p> <p>"Yes, I love it."</p> <p>"Why don't you take my coat so I can get the rest of my things? I'll meet you out here," she suggested.</p> <p>"Sounds good," I replied before I stood up and grabbed my things.</p> <p>She laughed with me as she stood up, and she hugged me hard. My hands slid up and back down her back as we stood there. I felt her warm ass press into my cock and it started to stiffen once again. She stepped back and just looked at me with those eyes that I loved to hear.</p> <p>"Are you ready to get out there and get some fresh air?" She asked.</p> <p>"If I could, I would," I told her.</p> <p>Once inside the small building, she said, "Can I get them for you?" and I nodded, not knowing what she had in mind.</p> <p>"Sure," I said, and she took them from my hands and held them out for me. While she held them back for me, I turned her towards the small back window that separated the lobby from the parking lot and we started walking slowly in that direction.</p> <p>Once inside, she opened her coat and hung it on the coat hook, while looking around the parking lot. There was not much to see beyond that side of the roof but it was pretty secluded. Once inside, she took my hand and let me lead her out of the building. I had not really noticed she had put her coat around her body, but I looked across the street and saw that this is no longer the case.</p> <p>I followed her around to the front of the building. She opened the door and we both stepped inside. The sun beat down on the building as I let her through the door. I shut the door after her and followed her to the back of the building.</p> <p>"You just about broke my heart back then," she said softly to me after we were inside.</p> <p>"I don't know," I teased back. "You're not my type."</p> <p>"Maybe for me anyway," she replied with a soft giggle.</p> <p>We started walking down the hallway that led to the back of the building. When we got to the second floor, I led her to the corner of the building where there was a small door.</p> <p>"I want to get away from here for a minute," I told her, and we heard a giggle from the corner. I went and opened the door and we stepped out into the sun. "If you stay here for a while," she asked.</p> <p>"That's fine with me," I told her, and she took a card from her purse. I started to follow her back down the hall to her room.</p> <p>"Wait," she called.</p> <p>"I'd better not," I told her as I got up the stairs to her room on the left.</p> <p>When I got inside her room, she was lying on her bed. I walked over and walked around to the other side of the bed, and I stood in front of her. She just lay there and kept her eyes closed. I stood quietly a few more minutes, and I moved back to behind her in the small room. I started to slowly unbutton her blouse from the middle button. As I reached the top of her bra, I undid it and took it off of her. I pulled off her panties first, then reached down and started to rub her clit with one hand, then my hand, and then began to rub her tits.</p> <p>She moaned and moved her head back from my hands, and I went to work on her clit and nipples. She was wet, and her sex was dripping. She gasped and moaned while I kept rubbing her. The harder I rubbed, the wetter she was getting. It was like heaven for both of us.</p> <p>I pulled my hand out of her pants and slid it down to her knee. Slowly, I began to slide it up her thigh. I pushed up to meet it and she gasped out again when I entered a finger or two into her.
