She grabbed my head between her hands and gently, but firmly, pulled me deep into her with one more suck on my tongue. I moaned in ecstasy and gave way to an even stronger pull.</p> <p>She moved her arms around my shoulders as I held her and pulled my hands away until they were all but resting on her buttocks. I lifted her up and sat her on my lap. My hands went up to her cheeks, my thumbs caressed the crack and over the anus. I looked into her eyes and smiled. She smiled back and then I slowly pulled back while holding her.</p> <p>I raised her and set her on the floor then stood with her on my knees then took a seat on the couch. She stood in front of me with her hands on her head. A grin of delight crossed my face. I turned her so that her back curved out. I took the tube of lube from her hand and then I began to work it into her anus. I could feel her tensing up as I worked more of it into her, her hands holding me more tightly. One finger began to massage my prostate and I pressed it hard into her. I felt her muscles contract around my finger as she moaned with pleasure.</p> <p>She stood up and moved her knees apart. I knelt in front of her, leaned forward and pressed the crotch of my pants against her moist pussy. I ran my thumbs around her tight anal opening before pushing my thumb into her anus. As she leaned back on the couch my hands worked up her cheeks to her shoulders, then down to her buttocks, which I squeezed and pulled gently. My thumbs stroked firmly from her anus up her slit, over her clit and around her cunt. I began to push the fingers of my right hand in and out of her before pressing them as far as I could into her. Her juices were freely flowing down my hand and she trembled as I worked them in and out of her, my thumb working her clit. She moaned loudly while I did it and then she began to rock back and forth. I felt the tip of my thumb press against her rear hole. Her anus contracted as I did it. I moved my hand inside her and began to push harder, pushing the head and then the knuckle of my thumb in. Her juices ran down my hand as she pushed herself back into it, taking more of me into her.</p> <p>She looked back at me with adoration and excitement as I worked her ass. Her eyes grew glassy with pleasure. Her cheeks parted widely. Her cheeks flexed as I worked her into a frenzy. She pushed back into me harder. She was moaning and groaning at every thrust. The muscles of her anus clenched at the tips of my thumbs. I looked at her face to see her pleasure again. I slid my hands down from her cheeks and let her legs down. Her buttocks hung out over the edge of the couch and her arms rose up behind her, her face turned to me. Her eyes showed pleasure as long lashes slid down over her eyes, watching me, not me. Her voice was a low, strained whisper, as she looked at me to see me respond to her.</p> <p>I smiled at her as she looked back then turned and lifted her face to me. Our lips met. Her lips were soft and warm and my hands caressed her body. There was no need for me to move a finger around in order to move my thumb in, as her lips were already moist. Our lips parted and we looked into each other's eyes. And then we smiled and I lowered our eyes. I kissed her nose, her cheeks, on her chin, her neck, her breasts. She pulled me closer and pulled me toward her. She kissed me again, and then moved away. She knelt up and looked into my eyes and said, "Fuck me, stud."</p> <p>I got to my knees on the couch and pulled her to me. My lips met hers again and then I felt the head of my cock press against her wet pussy. I rubbed the shaft in circles against her clit as my lips pressed against hers. When I felt her mouth open as I rubbed back against her cunt I slid the shaft inside and her hips flexed against me. I pulled back and then thrust harder into her. Our kiss broke and we looked into each other's eyes again. She looked like she enjoyed something that I had never, ever done. I leaned forward and we kissed again. After much kissing she pushed me back on the couch and climbed on top of me.</p> <p>She straddled my body, looking down at me with a mischievous look. She moved around slightly and my cock slid between her lips. She pushed herself down and my tip entered her. She slid a finger around me and then stroked me. I felt it touch her cervix.</p> <p>I pushed into herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
