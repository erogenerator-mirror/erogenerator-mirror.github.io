"What was that about? Because I've not been the one who was complaining, I'm not a one of those people."</p> <p>"Yeah, sorry, no apology necessary. I just didn't want to push you out on your ear. I was wondering what it would be like to be with just the two of you."</p> <p>"What? No. I didn't think you were serious."</p> <p>"Sorry? Is it a good thing or a bad thing?"</p> <p>"So long as it is a good thing." Her lips curled slightly as she smiled.</p> <p>"It can really get kind of interesting to say the least."</p> <p>"Yeah, that's what I thought too. Well come in, what are the conditions?"</p> <p>I went and sat on the edge of her bed after I'd washed my hands. The shower ran a little haphazardly as we sat down on the opposite side of her bed on her floor. She was right, she was actually pretty hot. Maybe not my best view in the world, but the one that I'd seen many times before when we first talked.</p> <p>I took in the curves and the contours of her body. I leaned against her as the water fell between us. She let out a breath, held the water up. I ran my fingers along the length of her naked torso. "So what are they you looking for? Are you looking to make this a one time fling?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure but if you ever do happen to have what it takes..."</p> <p>She trailed her fingers over her lips. "I think it would better than just a quick fling... You know, for your own sanity."</p> <p>"No, that's not what I'm looking for. The one thing that I'm looking for is a relationship."</p> <p>"Don't you want to sleep with me?"</p> <p>I saw the confusion in her eyes. "You know how I can go crazy?"</p> <p>"But... it has to be this way. Besides, if you think we'll sleep together if you have a boyfriend you know you could just go ahead and do it if you wanted to. You know you're going to end up spending the whole summer with me?"</p> <p>I looked down at the water dripping from my naked shoulders; I wasn't going to lie. I looked back up at her. "No, I don't think we should do that."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply there is a relationship. It's just that... I think we should do this right and have a normal relationship." She let out a small sigh, leaned back and closed her eyes. "Do you know what I'm thinking?"</p> <p>I sighed, nodded my head. "Maybe we should wait."</p> <p>"What would I do without you?" she asked as she reached down, grabbed a handful of my hair and pulled my head back. I leaned back as far as my shoulders would go as she rubbed the back of my neck with both hands, which almost caused me panic. I wanted to tell her that I loved her, but I couldn't. All the reasons in the world that she should still have to come to this point were so overwhelming that I could have killed her, I couldn't let her go.</p> <p>"I love you." I whispered.</p> <p>A smile played over her lips as she pressed against the back of my head. "I love you too."</p> <p>I pulled my head back, looked up at her and smiled. "We'll get it," I said and leaned forward to softly kiss her. I let out a soft sigh. She put her hands around my neck as she returned my tender kisses. She was surprised but relaxed as my lips were pressed against hers, as I let myself be wrapped within a soft embrace. I let myself take the lead and let my tongue slide all along her bottom lip. It was a small taste but pleasant.</p> <p>I could take the time for myself and she didn't notice. As I felt her arms go around me, the kiss ended and she let go of my neck with a sigh. "God, I needed that." She broke the kiss just long enough to nod off before turning her head to the side to her side and resting her hand on my shoulder. "I don't think you'll get it that hard, but you better take you time if you're not about to jump into bed with me."</p> <p>I felt like a little girl again for how long. When I heard her breathing and pulse quicken, I knew this was not going well. "I'm sorry, but I promise you I'm not going."</p> <p>She leaned in closer, her lips brushing against my ear. "Just so long as I take care of that big bad bear dick of yours, okay. You just might enjoy being with me."</p> <p>I hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
