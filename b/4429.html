I’ll be there!” She said. “I saw that sign. And it says that you were in a motel at some motel.” I’m going to let her keep this.</p> <p>“It’s a good idea.” She smiled.</p> <p>There is no way she would be home when I get home; and it won’t be long before we start making love. I know she is horny, but that isn’t the point.</p> <p>I was horny all of the time and it didn’t help at all. And I was about to start to have sex. I had been masturbating since about 3:00 this morning, when Sally called to tell me. I must have been dreaming for a while because I couldn’t remember when she had phoned on my cell phone. She sounded surprised, but seemed happy that I had been able to make my way over to a motel for the weekend. So, I decided I would take advantage of her. I went into her room and put a robe on and hurried through town to grab some things.</p> <p>Sally had taken a bathroom bathrobe. She came out a short time later dressed in a bath robe, as normal. I told her to lay down on the bed and we start a little movie. I’ll let her get a little rest before I start with her. I poured a glass of wine as she lay on her back with her head toward the front of the bed.</p> <p>While I laid down near her head and watched, she started playing with her nipples and occasionally rubbed a drop of perfume off of her nipple. It didn’t take long for her to get aroused. We went a little crazy, especially during this part of the tape. My cock was rock hard as Sally continued to rub herself, as we played with each others breasts. Her hand was under my robe, massaging my leg. I wanted her to feel my cock and balls, but knew nothing more was to be had.</p> <p>It was getting darker inside the hotel room, but I decided to take the time to check the fire escape outside the motel. When I closed the door to the room with the remote control, I heard a buzzing sound. We watched the movie.</p> <p>She must have been masturbating, and her eyes had closed. Her breathing was short and shallow. I thought that even though she was getting more aroused, she had stopped her playing with herself.</p> <p>I had not put all the lights on and we decided to just use the bedside-light. It was a small one in the room. I lit the lamp as it started going out the room. From the bathroom window, I could see Sally and the front of her robe, in front of our bed. The lights were switched off immediately, and we could see each other on the bed. Our eyes met for a good minute, as my cock was rigid in my robe; and she was looking at my crotch. She smiled at me, and pulled back the duvet enough to keep her breasts exposed.</p> <p>I knew that I shouldn’t, but couldn’t help myself as my cock was straining to get out of my robe. I turned and took off my robe. She quickly removed her robe and moved over to us. She had her head on my shoulder near my ear, and was breathing lightly. She was rubbing her crotch on my left leg, up to the waistband of my shorts. She moved up a little so that her breasts were against the front of my thigh. I put my right arm around her as we continued to watch the movie. I could feel her warm breath on my ear as she reached down and rubbed the crotch of my shorts. Her hand had reached my cock as my shorts were on the outside of her thighs. She rubbed around it a little, squeezing it a little. As she did this, her robe started to slip off of me. She broke for a moment, looking at me with a smile, and said that she didn’t want to hurt my feelings.</p> <p>I asked if I could put my arms around her for a few seconds. She lifted her head for a moment, looked me in the eye. She had a devilish look on her face as she said “Of course you can’t hurt my feelings, but in your dream, you made them come true for me.” I moved my face up to hers, and kissed her. At first, we just held each other. But then, we really started to get into it and it was obvious to me that we were going—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
