"So, I'd love to get that hot dog you gave me and get some good fuckin', but unfortunately, it's past noon. I just can't do that tonight. I'm supposed to go over to that little strip club up on the highway after midnight, get a couple of drinks, eat, do my hair, and then go home and crash. It's a good fifteen to ten miles to get to the last stop. I should go. I have nothing better to do. I'd really like to get another fuck, if only I got that good fucking," Bri said as a matter-of-factly.</p> <p>"We'll do that, sweetie," Todd said, "we'd better get your hot dog before it's too late!"</p> <p>Bri reached down and pulled the front of his T-shirt up so that his upper body was exposed to both women. She pushed her chair back a couple of inches, allowing Todd some room between. He took the hint, lifting himself up in his arms slightly and then dropping his arms off his lap.</p> <p>He watched them both step out of their chairs and then he walked around to the other side of each of their chairs. He lifted the backside of each chair so that he was facing them. He got down back on his knees between them, holding each other in his arms while they began to undulate against each other.</p> <p>"Why don't you get back into the game, honey?" Todd said, "You know I can play. I might even fuck that hot bitch tonight. I'll watch that fuck you're so hot for!"</p> <p>Bri couldn't help herself. She had never been this forward with another woman before in all her adult life, even a year ago when they were first dating. She just felt too guilty of letting the guy she really loved finger her to even consider giving her a hand job and getting into a fucking contest at the strip club. But somehow, right now, she just knew that she needed to be fucked.</p> <p>Bri stood up off of Todd's lap, turned around and backed up till she was almost in his lap. She sat back on her heels so that she could run both hands up and down each of her boyfriend's exposed legs. Their chests bounced softly as they moved. Todd rubbed her bare ass and ran her hands up and down his leg, teasing her until she moved her hands to her nipples and rubbed them as they rubbed against each other.</p> <p>Todd bent down and cupped both of Bri's breasts in his hands, moving them up and down as he massaged her tits and leaned forward, kissing her as he licked her nipples. He lifted both nipples, letting them pop into his mouth, sucking on them while he rolled and kneaded and kneaded them with his thumb and forefinger. They felt as hard as little pebbles and they ached for attention.</p> <p>Bri stood, leaning back against Todd and sliding her thong off before stepping away from the chair. She stepped back until Todd stood directly in front of her now. He leaned forward, pressing his lips against hers and forcing them apart. Bri moaned into their mouths as one of her hands went through his hair.</p> <p>"Bev," Todd said with a smile, "get up on the table. I want to do you from behind as I finger fuck you so you can be so ready to be fucked that you can't wait?"</p> <p>Bri climbed onto her hands and knees, her pussy hovering just over Todd's fingers as she lowered her face to the floor and started to rub her hands over Todd's thighs.</p> <p>"Come on, sweetie!" Todd said, "Fuck the shit out of me!"</p> <p>Bri knelt down and took his cock in her hand. She leaned forward and rubbed the head of his cock up and down her slit a couple of times, spreading her slick pussy juice over it. Then she turned to kiss him, sliding her body down until her pussy lined up with his crotch. She lifted herself onto him until she was sitting straight up against him.</p> <p>Slowly, almost teasingly, she began to rock her hips back and forth on his shaft.</p> <p>"Bev," Todd said, "Just a minute, baby, my fingers are too tired this way and you might even take a little Viagra!"</p> <p>Bri felt him get even harder in her hand, and she smiled up at him, pushing him into her. She began to ride him as she lowered her body down onto his cock. The feeling of his cock sliding through her pussy was unbelievable. She leaned forward farther until her lips were pressing close together against his neck. His hands quickly went back to her tits. He could feel little shivers shooting up her spine each time they touched her skin. And just as quickly, as he pressed into her, she beganâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
