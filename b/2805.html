She had loved every second of it.</p> <p>She sighed again and relaxed; "Mmmmmm. Oh god!"</p> <p>"That was so good baby. I want to do it again, soon again too..."</p> <p>She felt him smile down at her; "Then you will be my slut... you will be our slut."</p> <p>And just like that he was moving up and setting her between her spread legs, his cock ready to penetrate her.</p> <p>The heat coming off him made her jump.</p> <p>The sensation was so soft and gentle.</p> <p>But the fact that she was there and all around him in the world was different! It seemed so much more natural...</p> <p>She arched her back a little giving him a little more room to enter her.</p> <p>She smiled around her lips and leaned up a little further, "Ohhh, uhhh... uhhhhh..."</p> <p>He placed his hands on her hips and began slowly entering her, as if pushing a cock into her stomach. She felt him push in and she bit down on her lower lip. It always did that, it made the whole experience and the whole experience seem so good at the same time.</p> <p>She smiled again and closed her eyes; "Ohhh... uhh... god! Oh God Oh God Ohhhh!"</p> <p>And then it was him pushing in and pulling out.</p> <p>She felt his whole body moving as he got used to it. He moved with little motions, as if he was trying to find a new set of motions.</p> <p>She began to really enjoy it in a way she had never thought possible. He had an erotic control that she had never felt and she liked it a lot.</p> <p>He was in control and they both knew it. The love, the lust, the heat. She felt like she was in a trance!</p> <p>She closed her eyes and moved her face down towards his shoulder and wrapped it perfectly around the warm flesh.</p> <p>She could smell his cologne and smell his smell, all of his cologne, his hair and his masculine scent.</p> <p>She kissed his shoulder and smiled down to where his shoulder met his neck.</p> <p>The sight of his soft skin excited her even more, and she rubbed herself against his bare muscular body, "Ohhh...ohhh... that feels so good,"</p> <p>She heard him moan as he began to pick up his pace. She felt his cock sliding into her again. It didn't take much more and he would be ready to cum.</p> <p>"Ohhh... oh god... ohhh my god...!"</p> <p>She felt him speed up, pushing into her again and again.</p> <p>She closed her eyes again, reveled in the feel of his body moving against her and the feeling of his cock inside her. She felt as if she was swimming in his love fluid.</p> <p>He began to grunt and she could feel his cock getting bigger.</p> <p>"Ohhhh... ohhh ohhh!"</p> <p>She felt it then and it was pure heaven.</p> <p>Their bodies became one. It was so perfect. The touch, the feeling, the sound. It was like someone had lit a fire inside of her.</p> <p>She closed her eyes again and felt the warm feeling begin deep in her.</p> <p>"ohhh yes... yes... yes... yes!"</p> <p>I can feel it.</p> <p>She could feel the warmth, the way he was moving against her and the heat, the feelings. She was going to cum again.</p> <p>"Cum, baby... cum!"</p> <p>She could feel his cock swelling up inside her and she knew he was going to cum too.</p> <p>As her second orgasm began to wend a little, she heard some sort of noises, and felt the pressure of his hands on her and suddenly she felt the warm wetness of his tongue on her clit and her cunt. And it felt so good and she knew it wouldn't be long before she felt the first waves of her orgasm washing over her again.</p> <p>"Ohhh... uhhhh... yes... yes... yeeeer! Oh god!"</p> <p>She grabbed his arms as her body spasmed in a way she didn't think it could.</p> <p>She felt him take a couple of final strokes and then he slid his whole body against hers as they came together.</p> <p>"Ohhh!"</p> <p>And she opened her eyes again and saw the most beautiful thing for her in all her life. The softness of his face against her skin. The way he held her and kissed her, so tender.</p> <p>She felt so complete.</p> <p>She wanted more than just her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
