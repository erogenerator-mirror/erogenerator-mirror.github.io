That means no sex?"</p> <p>"Nope," and then she started laughing, again.</p> <p>Then she began talking a bit more to me.</p> <p>"Okay, enough already," she said.</p> <p>A moment later her fingers were back at her pussy again, and this time, she was inserting two fingers inside me as I was doing back at her. This got me even more excited.</p> <p>"There, that didn't hurt," she said again as she finger-fucked me.</p> <p>This elicited another laugh.</p> <p>"That was good!" she finished.</p> <p>She pulled out her fingers, and reached over to me, rubbing something onto my face and rubbing it into my lips, as I opened my mouth with a 'o' as she moved my lips wide apart and then pushed it in, and pushed it to my tongue. In a flash, I took the goo inside and sucked on it, as well as another finger from her.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt two more fingers in my pussy, and both fingers began moving in and out, in and out.</p> <p>Her orgasm was quickly approaching, as was mine, and just before she was coming it was a real orgasm, her pussy muscles squeezing my fingers as they were still moving inside, and her fingernails digging into my hips.</p> <p>My own orgasm started quickly and was immediately followed by hers. I kept my fingers in place even after they were gone and sucked on the cum and pussy juices from her fingers as I kept my mouth open.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she said.</p> <p>"Mmmph," was my response after a few seconds.</p> <p>"I love you," was what I said after she was ready to go again. "You're so beautiful."</p> <p>"I'm still a little embarrassed to put your fingers inside of me like that," was her reply.</p> <p>"Maybe it's time for you to change that," I said. "It's been a long time. I'm not sure you're ready."</p> <p>My own orgasm was quickly approaching, as was hers, and she was quickly making me cum over and over.</p> <p>"Are you going to tell me when you want me to let you cum anymore?"</p> <p>"I want you to do it," I said, my breath coming in gasps as she made me cum yet again.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, after letting me go for only a few seconds.</p> <p>Instead of taking off my clothes, or letting me go, she reached into our lingerie drawer and pulled out a strap-on, which she placed on her hips next to mine.</p> <p>She positioned herself with her body at the foot of the bed and spread her legs apart and began to press the crotch of the strap-on against her pussy. It looked like the cock I had seen in a porn video would look in porn films.</p> <p>"I know this would hurt, but I want you to try it," she said, and pushed a button and another strap-on appeared. "I have to be able to get this one up into your boyfriend's tight hole."</p> <p>The cock dildo was very big, as far as I could tell, as were the fingers.</p> <p>As she was lying on the bed, trying to position herself to try and get more of a grip on the fake cock, and not have me try to force it in, I stood directly above her and watched.</p> <p>Her eyes were wide as she stared down at me with anticipation.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, "we can try something different, but we're not gonna last too long."</p> <p>She leaned back on the bed and removed her panties, as I walked toward her, the small dildo bobbing inside her open pussy.</p> <p>"Ohhh," she said after watching me approach. "That doesn't seem real."</p> <p>I didn't know what to do. It felt so strange to see her looking down at me and the fake cock bobbing in front of her very attractive body.</p> <p>And when I turned back and stepped to the side, I saw her lying on the bed with the cock in her pussy, as I came closer.</p> <p>She put one of her hands on the bed and began to stroke the cock in her pussy. I felt my body flush as she did that, feeling like the cock in her pussy hurt more as it pushed in and out.</p> <p>"Oh, that is soooooo good," she said.</p> <p>She was still holding onto the dildo as she pumped it in and out of her pussy, but slowly she leaned toward me and began to lick the fake cock that was sticking inside her as she pumped it in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>I wanted to tell her how it felt, to say the words "this is notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
