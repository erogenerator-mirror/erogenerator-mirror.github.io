"You have nice muscle on you," Dana exclaimed.</p> <p>"Thanks, Dana," Ryan answered.</p> <p>Ryan got a quizzical look as he leaned toward her and his lips grazed hers. He looked up at her and said, "I have to admit I don't see you at a funeral."</p> <p>Dana smiled and sat down next to him. They kissed again and she felt his hand reach around her and start cupping her breast. His grip on the breast was firm and strong. She moved her lips to his ear and said, "Let's go inside."</p> <p>Dana and Ryan walked hand in hand down to the back yard. They stood in the middle of the yard in front of a large stone fireplace. Dana pulled Ryan into her arms. He wrapped his arms around her body and they began kissing again. Dana wrapped her legs around his. Ryan was holding on tightly to the woman he loved when he thought he could do it even after the death of his wife. He was amazed at his woman. He loved her too. But there were reasons for this passion. First of all, he did not know what was going to happen to her or if anything more. Dana was going to live the rest of her life with the man she loved.</p> <p>Ryan was having a hard time containing his feelings of confusion. He had to know what was going to happen between them. It might not have been what he had expected with the woman he loved but somehow they were going to make their own love. "Dana," Ryan said, "What are you doing?"</p> <p>Dana looked at him and said, "What are you doing Ryan?"</p> <p>"I just want to know what have you and my wife been doing together?"</p> <p>"Just what?"</p> <p>"Just what I mean when we were talking about you. You know?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah. That's something I know."</p> <p>"Ryan, please. I love you. We're going to have a lot of fun together."</p> <p>Ryan sat down and said, "Yeah I know. I agree. You have to admit that it was an awesome time. I think that it's all a part of life."</p> <p>"We have the whole thing to think about. I never felt like it when you weren't here and when I told Dan I was going to start taking the kids over to work. At least now we know who knows what the kids are doing." Dana paused and looked at Ryan, then reached up and took his hand in hers. "It's just what we had been doing. I'm glad we made the decision. I just hope we can have a lot of fun together."</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
