"You really seem pretty well fucked!"</p> <p>She smirked. "So do you, I'll admit," she said. "I'm still not really sure what I'd call it if I didn't have you."</p> <p>"So you haven't even seen this guy?" He said, pointing at the laptop. "I got one of you to meet me. Where in the world does his name come from?"</p> <p>"It's his real name," she said quickly before he got it. It was a long story, with some interesting twists.</p> <p>"Yeah, he's pretty nice, too. I think some of the other guys around here are pretty nice too. He has his own apartment. He's got a spare bedroom that's a bit nicer than most of the dorms I hang out by now. The guy I saw you with came in for one of the beers he offered me last night. He kept it cool.</p> <p>"He's also got a great room, too... and I thought 'I hope so...'" She laughed nervously. "So you can have a real one to relax off you. It makes staying out with me feel like you should have a real home."</p> <p>He nodded at that. "I guess we both have to agree. I was just asking about you."</p> <p>"Don't think I'm coming on too strong," she said. "You know what I like about you?" She smiled. "So, I have a little confession to make?"</p> <p>"Just in case," he said with a smirk. "I found it really interesting that you had a friend in your dorm, too. I'm guessing you two had a few drinks. I'll ask you this for you, though: is it unusual for you and his roommate to be doing this?"</p> <p>"Maybe," she said. "Maybe not. They seem to enjoy each other's company a lot, but if they're even doing it together, I don't understand why they would do something like this here."</p> <p>"Good point," he said, nodding. He knew why they hadn't. "So, tell me. Did you and the roommate swap friends?"</p> <p>"Not even one of them knew for sure that the roommate was my roommate, at least. He's not too interesting, though. The last boyfriend was a total asshole before I even met him. He was still my boyfriend and I loved being the rebound boyfriend.</p> <p>"When I started seeing him on more than one occasion, I didn't exactly enjoy the entire relationship, but I just did what I needed to do. I let him get away with things and we ended up talking and having some fun. Maybe I had to do it for the same reason," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah... I saw that he came more than once in a night," he said, not sounding surprised. He wasn't sure she was making that statement.</p> <p>The memory didn't faze her. "Well," she said, "he did have one particular relationship I liked."</p> <p>"What happened, then?"</p> <p>She shrugged. "It didn't come that way. At the beginning, we were just friends, right?" She said. "It just kind of started," she said, a hint of sadness in her voice, "but we got closer over the years and things only got better."</p> <p>"Okay, I get it," he said. "Is it because you're not so attached to them?"</p> <p>She didn't respond before she was interrupted. "D-do you know what this is he's trying to do to us?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, what, me? Does he know how to make us think we're not special?" he said.</p> <p>She shook her head. "I've been talking to him about it too," she said, "but it's mostly him. He just happens to be his first roommate."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "I'm not exactly surprised. I do get it, though."</p> <p>"I'd like to ask you something, okay?"</p> <p>He nodded. It wasn't that big of a deal. She probably wouldn't get back what they had, and if he did, they definitely would discuss it, though they'd also probably talk about it.</p> <p>"Okay," he said.</p> <p>"It's not like I'm going to be in a relationship with them all my life. It really doesn't matter. He's good with his relationship, he just comes across as more the 'real' guy after all."</p> <p>"You're not kidding, right?" He frowned at her.</p> <p>She nodded, then shook her head. "If, you know what makes this a good relationship—especially with the right person—that's not really a good relationship.
