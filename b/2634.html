Lizzy whispers, "Now do you want to feel me touching the rest of you?"</p> <p>I lean forward and whisper into her ear, "Yes."</p> <p>"Good." She says. My head is still bowed as she lays down next to me and grabs both of my hands.</p> <p>"Let's do this." She says, "I want it to go so smooth so we can feel each other's bodies for the first time."</p> <p>"It isn't that easy." I say, "Just trust me."</p> <p>She raises me up a little so my head is hanging off the end of the bed so it is in the correct position. I feel her hands massaging my shoulders and back as her mouth opens and begins sucking and licking my right breast. My breathing is getting more laboured as I continue to massage her upper back and lower back, hoping she could feel my excitement as my breasts move gently in and out of her mouth. The tip of her tongue flicking at the erect nipple which is now poking through the soft fabric of the lacy top I have on.</p> <p>"I like it." I say, "It's making my clit tingle and the feel on it makes my pussy muscles tingle!"</p> <p>Lizzy's mouth clamps tight around my nipple and she moans against it and then opens her mouth and slips her tongue under the cloth covering it and slides her tongue inside.</p> <p>"Oh god yes!" I scream out as a shudder shoots through my body, my hands clutching at Lizzy's head and her hips pumping up and down. "Oh god... oh god yes... oh god yes yes yes..."</p> <p>The intense feeling of her tongue touching my nipple and her hands cupping and squeezing my breast is sending me to orgasm again, but not very quickly. I'm gasping for air, trying not to moan and trying to catch my breath and to think if this was all a game after all! After a few minutes Lizzy slides her tongue out, and I feel the wetness of her mouth on the tip of my nipple.</p> <p>"Oh god yes... please... oh god... please don't stop!" I exclaim.</p> <p>She sucks it in and nibbles at the small nub of my nipple, leaving it hard and shiny, and then she licks all around it, licking lightly across my nipple and back to my breast in a slow sensual movement. She looks up at me and says</p> <p>"I didn't see you cum so quickly." Liz says, "It was good for just a little while."</p> <p>She takes a finger and starts rubbing my hard clit, and then she wraps her hand around my hard nipple, pressing it hard against my body, and then she begins to move it back and forth, back and forth rubbing it against my hard clit. "Oh god yes!" I cry out. "Put your clit!"</p> <p>"Yes!" She moans softly as I am still moving my hips up and down. "Yes!"</p> <p>I hold her and moan into her ear as I continue to rub my clit.</p> <p>"Faster now." She says.</p> <p>She takes my right hand from my pussy and pushes it under the top of my bikini bottom. I try to spread them as my fingers slide over the soft fabric and then feel the warmth on my hand where the moisture I can't actually feel drops off my finger to the sandalwood of my bikini bottoms. I put my hand back in my lap and then take it off the end of her strap.</p> <p>"Put it back on." She commands as she stands up, leaving my hand laying on my bare mound.</p> <p>She walks over to where I was on my hands and knees, lying down on the sand, and slides her body up to the edge of the bed, her right leg and her left leg on the outside edge, her thighs apart, her left knee propped up on the bed. "Now... put it back on."</p> <p>It turns out her right strap is tied off with a length of string tied off to one end of the bow.</p> <p>"Oh god yes," I scream out as I raise myself up a bit in order to pull both the top part off my left breasts and then the right one, dropping my right leg back down to the chair next to the chair. She has one hand on my right breast squeezing it tightly, the first nipple hard as I feel the tension of the string pull.</p> <p>She smiles. "Good pet." She says and begins to rub the end of the string up and down across my nipple. "That feels really fucking nice." She says, "It's a good thing that no one ever told me anything like that."</p> <p>She continues to rub my nipple with the string until it'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
