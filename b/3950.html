Her heart ached for that moment. This time she should show him her appreciation, and when the time came, she would make the most of it. She let those feelings wash over her over and over again, and she was almost disappointed when he moved. Her heart was pounding and her breath was taken away by the power of this moment. When he looked back at her, his blue eyes were as blue as the sea. His eyes were like his own. His hand slowly moved down her body with a slow deliberateness that caught the hunger in both of them in a moment like a storm. The moment he touched her, as much as it was like the heat of the day, the storm had turned to something more intense and intense as pleasure coursed through her. Even as her body shuddered and shook, she could feel the heat of his stare in her eyes. He could tell she was almost as wet as he wanted to be. That hunger again surged through his eyes, a look of urgency and excitement to see her exposed to him. He could feel the wetness of her desire on his skin, and he lifted her in his arms and gently kissed her lips.</p> <p>As he moved closer towards her, he could taste the taste of his own arousal on her lips. His fingers traced her neck, his face inches from hers. He watched as he held her close as he looked in her deep blue eyes and then leaned into her. When she wrapped her lips around his, he could no longer keep his hands off of her body even if it had been his duty to restrain them. He slid his fingers slowly down her body and let one slide under the fabric of her tank top. He slid the other finger up her side, under her shirt to her breast and around to her nipple. He slid his fingers back to her other nipple, and the slight pain he felt told him that she knew what he was doing. When she felt the warmth of his hand, it felt like heaven on her skin.</p> <p>He pulled his lips away from hers. "You are so beautiful," he said as his fingers slid up to her chin, and he tilted her head up to his mouth, where he kissed her once and then again. His hands glided down her body to the middle of her hips, and he slid his hands up the back of her leg. When he lifted her foot, he felt her body tremble a bit as her leg spread on its own to allow him access to her pussy. When he slid his tongue across her pussy, he could feel the heat and hunger of her body on his tongue. He moved his fingers away from her nipple to her clit, and when he touched it, it was like a electric current as it began to run over his fingers. He could feel her body shudder as he continued to tease her body. He let his fingers continue to tease her clit and feel the tingles that were quickly growing and becoming stronger. He could taste her sex on his fingers, and the musky tang of her arousal on his tongue made him hard almost instantly.</p> <p>"Touch me," she almost growled to him.</p> <p>He nodded, and moved his hands toward her. He slid them across her shoulders and slid them down to her sides. He slid his fingers over her breasts as his eyes watched as he watched her. He felt as if he was about to touch another of her body's most most intense desires or desires, and if they were there at all, he would gladly allow her to enjoy them. When her back was turned to him, he looked down to see how wet she was to be touching another woman. That thought alone made him smile as he watched her body trembling on the way to orgasm. He gently slid his fingers up and down across her clit, making her shiver in pleasure. His finger began to circle and run over her hole, making her clit twitch and make a low moan of pleasure.</p> <p>It had almost come to him just how much she was enjoying it as she had done to him. It was as if someone inside her had given her that moment when her body took over. She closed her eyes and her lips moved against the fabric of her tank top, and she was lost to her thoughts. His thumb moved to her clit and began to trace circles across which he could feel it building with each pass of his hand. As his body moved in a way that she would only do so at her request, he could feel how desperate she was becoming for him to touch her. He shifted off the bed so his body was now leaning into hers from the sudden change in his position. With that shift, he could feel her legs spread and her body tensing, and his hands were moving faster and faster. He wanted to move over her, to find what she would call a connection she would never forget. He wanted to give herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
