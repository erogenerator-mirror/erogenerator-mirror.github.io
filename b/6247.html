"Would you like some more?"</p> <p>Betsy took a step towards him, her eyes burning into him. After a moment, his mouth fell to her neck, where his tongue slowly licked her collarbone. He was still dressed, and she knew she should protest. "No," she said after a moment, "I don't think I should be doing this."</p> <p>Betsy looked down at him, and there was no more fear in her eyes as she shook her head vigorously. Her hands moved to his neck, pulling him to her. Her eyes were filled with passion and need.</p> <p>"No," she hissed, "Let me get dressed," and without another word she pulled him by the shirt, and headed off to the bathroom.</p> <p>When she returned she looked at him, and he looked at her.</p> <p>"Get undressed. I want to go shopping, and if you are up for that, then you can join me."</p> <p>He stared at her as she removed her coat, shirt and pants, and turned on the water for bath salts. She pulled her panties off and dropped them on the ground. She reached behind and unhooked her bra, freeing those big, beautiful breasts. She reached back to slide her panties down.</p> <p>She was so small, and he so big. He had to touch her, but she was too small.</p> <p>When he reached for her hips she pushed him away and he grabbed her hand and led her to the bed. The sheets were smooth and soft next to the bed. She crawled on to it and he slid under her.</p> <p>She reached up and touched his cock, feeling the big ridges. "You're so big," she said, and he groaned. She slid down and wrapped her lips around the head of it and started to blow gently. He moaned and pushed deeper inside her mouth.</p> <p>After a minute he had to stop and pull away. He reached over and unbuttoned her jeans, and pulled them off over her hips. She wasn't wearing panties, so when they fell to the floor, he quickly pushed them aside and was soon between her legs. He stroked her, getting her wet before lowering his head. When he touched her clit she moaned and moved her hips.</p> <p>When he came up for air, he reached out to cup her breasts and played with her hardening nipples. She cried out and pulled his hands back to her tits.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asked, and she nodded, "yes, I feel it."</p> <p>She reached down and grabbed his cock, and guided his mushroom-shaped head inside her. It was so large and long, that he had trouble getting it inside her. He looked down at her and pulled her up so she lay on her back.</p> <p>He began thrusting into her, and she put her hand on his stomach. The feeling was too good, almost more than the fullness. He thrust into her several times, and she started to orgasm. He stopped and lay on top of her, her legs wrapped around his waist. She pushed him off and held him to her with her arms.</p> <p>She turned his face to hers and kissed him with passion. When she rolled him on top of her, she was panting, and he had no problem sliding the condom off.</p> <p>He kissed her again as she reached for an article of clothing. When he saw that she wouldn't be taking anything in, he helped her pull it over her head. When that was gone, she had a beautiful, healthy-looking body.</p> <p>She lay on the bed and he lay on top of her as he kissed her neck, shoulders and chest. When he got to the top of her shorts, he pulled them off, rolling down the blanket to her chest. He found a blanket and covered her, kissing her face and moving down to her breasts.</p> <p>She raised her legs to feel him between them. She felt so sexy as he touched her between her legs, the cool air of the room on her sensitive skin. Slowly he was moving down, and when her eyes closed she felt his dick pressing against her.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered, "that's it."</p> <p>"Oh, Betsy, you feel so good," he said as he started to lick her. She held onto his neck, and he pushed in until she felt it at the back of her cunt, then withdrew before kissing her again. She held onto his head now, and she guided him more deeply as he lapped up her clit.</p> <p>When he found her G spot, she had a huge climax. She came around his dick almost instantly, and he made her cum with his lips and tongue. She came long and hardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
