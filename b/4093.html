Her words about going for one night stands might sound a little silly now but, I think, she was right. We were both looking forward to coming back to each other one day soon and making love to each other. Maybe we were only trying to find happiness when we realized that, if we really didn't want to, we'd have to put us past each other, start over.</p> <p>As it was, I was getting better at it already and I felt that I could start a relationship with her. I had a big responsibility to help her learn to deal with all this. I'm just a guy and we haven't even had sex in forever and, I've been waiting for a girl to come along. I didn't know why but, there hasn't been any girl on the face of the earth who has said, "I will never have another one of those!" and that's all because she didn't want one of them. I can relate, we weren't ready to commit like that but, if we could find the one, we could start a new life together. Maybe when I finish with her I can have a really good future after all this pain and suffering. I know how much I love her but, it'll have her back to being happy. She's right, I can't even begin to describe the hurt and hurt that I felt for her, I wanted to be with her.</p> <p>The more and more that I thought about it, the more it struck me that I still wasn't ready to commit and commit at the same time. If we were able to find the one and only time that we'd be together, then we could start making love to each other. If we had the ability to look at each other and see each other's needs and wants, I know our relationship would be the same. I couldn't even ask for a guy to do that just to me. No, this is just going to have to wait.</p> <p>I turned the computer off and sat there on the bed, feeling that I was doing better. That was until I heard a woman crying softly from one of the rooms on the top floor. I reached over and gave her a big hug and held her close until she stopped crying. "How's it going?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's going good." Was all she said.</p> <p>"I'm happy for you now." Just then, there was a phone call. I answered, "It's Bob." He asked, "Can you tell me who it is?" I replied, "It's Carol. Are you mad at her?" she asked. A second woman answered, "No, I mean it's all right." I said, "Come over tomorrow if you want to tell Bob." I said, "I'm going to leave you a note to meet you in the lobby. I will be on the other end tonight for one of my sessions." After she hung up the phone, I said, "I'll talk to you later," and said goodnight to a different couple of women.</p> <p>When the doorbell chimed I opened the door and there stood, and I saw, just like she did, is a beautiful woman. I took her in my arms and gave her a big hug and kissed her on her lips and said, "Honey, you're everything I hoped for." She hugged me back and said, "Thank you." Then, she said, "Can we talk again?"</p> <p>I said, "Absolutely." As she walked toward the door, I asked, "Is there anything else I can do for you to know about?"</p> <p>She said, "No, I'll come right over." I told her that I was coming over tomorrow to talk with Carol and that she could meet me in the lobby. I kissed her on the cheek and told her to have fun and that I was going to see her at 8 o'clock that evening. When I closed the door, I kissed her on the cheek and said, "Thank you. Is there any more problems?" She said, "No not really. I'd better get ready. I just love meeting you." Then she walked to her room and closed the door.</p> <p>The next day, I woke up early hoping that she was still there, but she was nowhere to be found. When I opened my eyes in the morning, there was a note on the night stand beside the bed saying, "Bob, I'm sorry that you couldn't make it to work this time but, I know we're still a long way from home but, at least we'll be able to have some fun and be together, tomorrow."</p> <p>It sure sounded nice to me but, no man had come up here until I got some answers from herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
