My head was spinning now as I realised that I wanted more.</p> <p>"Then stop," she ordered.</p> <p>I had not really thought of that or how to answer but she kissed me again and my tongue shot into her mouth. Then she pulled out her wet fingers, which she quickly stuck into my mouth and I could taste the cream I'd made with them, and she licked them clean.</p> <p>"I always liked that taste," she said. "And now it's much better."</p> <p>"I love the taste of your cream when you're sucking me," I murmured as she pushed her fingers back in front of my face. I started to lick my cum off the hand she'd been stroking me with as she put one finger right into my mouth, then moved on to the second finger. She pressed hard against my tongue, so that all I could taste was her wetness and her pussy juice. It was as if her juices weren't as dry in there as my own cum was, but in the same spirit as the taste of the cream she'd made for me. I was in desperate need of one of her fingers.</p> <p>"I'll show you," she said, opening her legs. "But this is only your first time."</p> <p>She took a few steps back as she reached a hand to my head and I saw the glistening of my cream on her finger. She pressed it into my mouth and then kissed me deeply, my cum was everywhere, my tongue lolling out, wetting her lips.</p> <p>"Open wide," she ordered, pressing her tongue deep into my mouth.</p> <p>I opened my mouth, but was not prepared for the hard sharp points of her tongue.</p> <p>"Show me now," she whispered in my ear as I felt her soft warm breath on my skin.</p> <p>She rubbed her hand over my cheek before gently caressing the back of my neck. Then she let go of my neck, grabbed my wrists and pushed my hands against the wall. She bent to my ear and said.</p> <p>"Show me."</p> <p>"What?" I asked, shocked at the request.</p> <p>"Show me," she insisted in my ear.</p> <p>It wasn't so much a request now as it was a statement of fact. I watched her in the mirror and then saw her smile as she touched my shoulders, then walked around to where I was standing.</p> <p>"Do it," she said. "Show me how you love me."</p> <p>But her tone of voice said more than the question at all. She said it and it meant more than the question. There was, perhaps, a part of me that still hoped my relationship with her would continue but the other part of me knew there was no question I wanted to continue, to be with her...</p> <p>"You want me to suck your cock," she said, her voice just above a whisper. "Show me."</p> <p>"Show me," she commanded again as she stepped back so that I was standing in front of her. I was shocked but also proud of the fact that the look she'd given me the other day when I'd been sucking her cock that day had meant a lot to me. "Show me," she said in that same low husky voice again. I could not take my eyes off the thick purple knob she'd stroked with her fingertips as she looked down, her fingers still moving up and down the length of it.</p> <p>"Yes, show me," I said again as I slowly turned away so that my knees were touching the tiles of the floor. "I want to feel your mouth."</p> <p>She laughed softly in response. I felt so close to her and so aroused, but I also felt the need to be close to her. A couple of tears, then, but it was enough to drive through me and I had to have her. I needed her, needed to lick her, and I needed to be naked with her, wanting her to feel naked with me. I stepped closer to her, trying to look away as much as I could but she pushed away quickly, pulling me into a standing position. I was not sure whether it was the fear that had set in or what she was going to have me look at.</p> <p>"I think this is the right place for you," she said, kneeling to my front, facing me. "Where do you want to be?"</p> <p>"On my knees," I said quickly. "Up your back."</p> <p>"And up all the way down there?" she asked, her voice husky and excited as she pulled my head down over her shoulder and pressed her breasts against me so that I felt her warm naked skin and the smoothness of her skin against mine as she lowered herself.</p> <p>She pushed her breasts against mine, then my chest, beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
