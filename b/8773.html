I learned that she was a student at the state university, just out of school. She was a tall lady, with a cute face and figure. She had dark hair and auburn coloring. I had never seen a woman as attractive and I had never been with a woman as hot. We discussed our families and work history, our favorite sports, movies and favorite foods and we all seemed to know the others. Her mother, whom I had always assumed to be another cousin in her family, was also a friend.</p> <p>We both had heard of several other couples of her peers coming to the city. Each time, I had met them, they each seemed to recognize my wife. All of the guys at the office that had heard our stories said that my wife was sexy as hell. They seemed to be very complimentary of me, because I had never met. I made a comment that my wife was too short to take care of me, which was very true. We had been to some movie theaters, but I never got a good look at my wife during that time. They seemed to have not been the kind of people she would want to be with in the future. Then the other day on the beach, when she stripped naked in front of me with my eyes bugging out, the one guy got me to undress him with my eyes and mouth. She had told him that it was something she did with her girlfriends at one time, and he'd probably gotten a second thrill on his face when she said that, because he could feel how hard she was getting with me on that day.</p> <p>In the future, I had met my wife at a bar that I occasionally went to since the summer before my senior year of high school. After the first bar we'd had, I went to the same bar with her several times each week. The next evening, we went back with her to her house, where I had dinner and she had watched some of the movie, so we went and sat on the couch together. Before the night was out, we had both stripped to our underwear, but this time, we did not keep our clothes on. When she had turned out to strip me, I had been ready for a turn, but I did not expect a kiss, so our lips just touched for a few seconds.</p> <p>My hand had been working its way over my wife's breast in the same moment, rubbing her side gently and her upper body. When she felt my hand, she lifted it to her lips and licked her own lips. "It's been too long, sweetheart," she said, "you might come early tonight."</p> <p>My hand had moved to her waist. I pulled her towards me, and the two of us kissed for a moment, with my tongue exploring her mouth. My hand started its work in back and over her ass, and then to her pussy. My hand slid into the top of her panties to probe her, while my other hand moved her to the couch until her head was resting on the end.</p> <p>Our kissing continued for several minutes, as my hand moved to the front of her panties. She knew it, and that it was something we had both done to each other. My fingers traced her pussy lips, until I could feel the wetness of her. With a final kiss, I pulled her panties down just a bit and allowed her hand to follow the way it was going and start exploring my cock again, this time in earnest.</p> <p>I slid two fingers into her, and as I did, she rubbed her clit with the head of my cock, and I knew she was ready for it, too. While her hand was pleasuring me, rubbing my cock with the head of my fingers, she reached for my ass and pulled me towards her as our lips met again. When our tongues met, I held my hand very still inside her and she used the force to push me toward her as the kiss lasted longer and more passionate. After a moment, I moved my fingers from inside her and slid them inside her slowly, all the way up to her clit. When I did this, she moaned in ecstasy.</p> <p>My fingers kept working in and out of her, until she reached down with one hand and gently started to stroke my cock, taking her hand away. "Oh, baby, I've missed that," she whispered with a smile.</p> <p>"I haven't been to this part of town in a long time, sweetheart," I told her as she continued to stroke my cock slowly.</p> <p>"Me either, darling," was the best I could muster, as she looked at me as if ready to say something, when suddenly she said, "Oh, sweetheart, we can't."</p> <p>"Yes we can, honey," I said, "but just go and lay on your back on your bed, and let me haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
