She knew it wouldn't take long for me to come soon because her actions were giving me more pleasure. As she fucked me, I began to cum with each of her thrusts. As I came, my body reacted differently than the first time as my cock and balls reacted to the feeling of our bodies. I could feel my blood racing through my veins. I felt my dick swell with each spurt, and I could tell that was turning her on tremendously.</p> <p>She started to thrust in and out faster. Her tits were flopping wildly with their movements, and her hips were slamming into me with each thrust. I was grunting in time with her moves, and she was grunting out with her own movements. She lifted herself up the bed in the air and let me do all the work, while her hands and mouth reached out grabbing my butt and pulling me closer.</p> <p>We fucked for a long time, and her body was reacting to her second orgasm of the night. I think she still hadn't moved from underneath me, but I wasn't done. My cock was now aching for release and I was afraid I wouldn't last long.</p> <p>I lifted herself up on my chest and sat up to support my upper body. She was looking at me as she leaned forward and took my dick back into her mouth, sucking on it.</p> <p>"Ohh, that feels so damned good!" I said. "You suck cock like you're a great cocksucker, but that's not what I'm after," I said.</p> <p>"I love your dick," she said.</p> <p>"I love your pussy," I said with a smile as I leaned down and kissed her. "Your mouth is so fucking sexy, and your body is so hot."</p> <p>I slid off the lounge chair at her side and put my naked dick back into my swimsuit. She leaned toward me and kissed me again.</p> <p>"I'm going to shower now," she said. "And I'll see you later, right?" She said, before I could respond.</p> <p>The next day I couldn't get out of bed to see if Julie had finished anything, so it was all I could do to make it a quickie. I wanted to take my time showering, but I wasn't sure I would be able to resist her. When I walked out the door in my swimsuit, she was already out in the kitchen.</p> <p>"Well?" she said with a mischievous smile. "What do you think?"</p> <p>I walked slowly by her heading for the bathroom, holding my arms open slightly.</p> <p>"Uh, yeah," I said. "Well, yeah. I'll shower, if you like."</p> <p>She just grinned at me and turned to go back into the kitchen. I followed, only a little slower than she did, so I could enjoy watching her sexy ass. She was wearing a sexy little number that I had seen on Julie. It was a red lacy mesh teddy with matching panties, that really hugged her sexy form. She turned and waved at me from across the kitchen. I turned back around. She leaned down and leaned over to kiss me.</p> <p>"I'm ready to shower," she said as she kissed me.</p> <p>"Go ahead," I said as I grabbed her waist and pulled her into the shower.</p> <p>The water was so warm and it really made me want to just take her right there.</p> <p>"You should take more time," I said as I finished washing her body.</p> <p>"Not all of it," she said. "Just the parts you like more."</p> <p>"Oh, I like all kinds of things. What do you think of a lot of them?" I asked.</p> <p>"I like the ones you like the most."</p> <p>I smiled at her like I knew she was serious. "Do you really think I'll do those things with you?"</p> <p>"Of course I really do."</p> <p>"I like the ones that have the best of both, and I'm sure you'll like it too," I said. "Soap," I said as I poured soap in her hand and began to rub it on her back.</p> <p>"Yeah... I'd love to use my body against yours," she said as she finished washing me.</p> <p>"You mean you want me to do the other stuff to you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Uh-huh."</p> <p>"Are you serious?" I asked as I washed her.</p> <p>"Oh, I am. Are you serious?" she breathed.</p> <p>"I've loved having you do these for me."</p> <p>"I always knew," she said as her hand went to my balls and began to stroke them slightly.
