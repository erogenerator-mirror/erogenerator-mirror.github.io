He said. "I have been looking forward to this meeting all day." He looked over the paperwork and pulled out his card from his back pocket. "Call me." He said, his voice deep and soothing.</p> <p>"Call me," I replied, my voice a whisper.</p> <p>"Very well, Madam." He gave me the card and smiled.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed me deeply. He pulled away from the kiss, but then leaned in again, giving me a second to recover from the kiss and take a breath before he pressed the card back in my back pocket.</p> <p>"Call me." He said, his voice a whisper to my ear, and left the building. My heart raced in anticipation of what might be about to happen. I sat there in the waiting room, waiting for everything to happen. It didn't take long, but I was very nervous as we moved through the reception area of the firm office building. As was expected, someone approached me and whispered something in my ear. I laughed nervously.</p> <p>"Hello! It's Mr. Wilson, the Executive Manager who ran the office this weekend." He said, his voice calm and casual. "Would you please follow me? I'm afraid it would be too embarrassing to leave him in the men's room." I laughed nervously when I saw him.</p> <p>"No, no, of course I'll be fine, Ms. O'Connor. Thank you." I tried not to act awkward, but I had little choice in the circumstances.</p> <p>When we got to the elevator, he pushed the button for entry. I followed him as he walked across the lobby. I watched his ass as he followed me, his taut ass cheeks swinging to the rhythm of the music. I got on the elevator and waited for him at the end of the hallway. When the doors slid down, we exited the elevator and he grabbed my hand. He held the door and led me down the hallway. I followed him up a flight of steps leading to a large door. When he knocked on the door, his eyes were red where the lights were already coming on.</p> <p>A soft feminine hand brushed the top of my head as we approached a red door with the door on the left. It opened in a large room, a large room for a small office. I followed, his hand caressing my thigh. I felt as though one of my legs was going to tear off with excitement. He pushed his fingers into me, gently sliding them into my wet pussy and rubbing their length in and out, rubbing around my clit. We broke the kiss and I heard a soft moan of pleasure as we entered the building.</p> <p>Inside I looked around the large room, all of the windows were open, and there were lots of windows. A small conference table with four chairs was situated right in the middle of the room. The room was dimly lit, the room smelled faintly of sweat, perfume, and sex. A woman in her forties was seated at the table, but her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, just like the others. She wore a long red gown and a long silver necklace adorned her cleavage. Her face was still flushed from her passion. When we entered the room he pushed me against the wall and kissed me with a passion that I wasn't sure of. When we broke our embrace, I could almost feel the blush over my cheeks.</p> <p>He moved quickly to the other side of the room, and I watched as he placed something behind his back. He handed my drink and kissed me softly again, his fingertips brushing the smooth lips of my mouth. When he pulled back I found myself unable to speak. I didn't dare to and it shocked me. He grinned at me and asked me if I wanted him. I simply nodded yes.</p> <p>He took my hand and pulled me towards the couch. He sat next to me and kissed me again, as he unbuttoned the buttons on my shirt. He caressed my breast through the thin cotton of my bra. I felt as though I would explode with desire again. When he pulled my shirt off, another set of lips followed. When he kissed my neck, his hands caressed my breasts, which were exposed in the dimness of the room.</p> <p>When he pulled the last piece of clothing from my skirt, he lifted my skirt and I pulled it down, allowing him to remove my panties. My pussy was now exposed to his eyes and as he leaned to kiss my panties, I felt his tongue slide into my slit. It felt so damn good. He slipped his tongue right up into my pussy and licked around it. The feeling was incredible. I had never had anyone go down on me before and I was afraid of breaking it. But he just smiled and licked me up the side of my neck and nibbled at myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
