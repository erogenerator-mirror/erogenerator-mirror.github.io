He was still fully erect when I broke the kiss and rolled him over onto his back. He looked up at me with a question in his eyes. I told him, "We haven't had sex yet. We'll need some time," and then slid back over me until we were lying side by side. We kissed again then I moved down to his erect cock. As I sucked him into my mouth I held him there for a second or two then moved my head back up.</p> <p>He moaned again and placed his hand on my head. I moved one of his legs over mine and let him move it over my head. I could feel how hard he had become and I moaned again. I moved my mouth down his cock again and let him fuck my mouth. As I sucked him I caressed my breasts and pushed my fingers into my pussy. I could feel that the pressure was building and I knew it would soon be over. I moved my mouth up over his cock again and looked up at him as he smiled.</p> <p>"What are you thinking?" he asked.</p> <p>I looked at him for a long moment then said softly, "We'd like to keep playing."</p> <p>"I'm still a virgin, and with my girlfriend's boyfriend..."</p> <p>"She's a virgin?"</p> <p>It wasn't that I couldn't get her off, in fact we had a good relationship with plenty of us getting oral. But, she was a quick study.</p> <p>"Not really. I guess I'm just thinking you could do anything with her. I know you can do anything with her. I've seen the way guys look at her. I'm sure she has a crush on you."</p> <p>"If she does, I don't know if I'm a good guy."</p> <p>"She wouldn't know, she's a friend."</p> <p>He laughed then said, "Can I keep her for a while?"</p> <p>I said, "I'm not sure I can, but we'd like to keep it as we have. I feel bad I've pushed you so far."</p> <p>He said, "I feel the same way, it's not like you haven't been with someone. I mean, there were a couple of times I had sex with a girl, I don't know what the hell it was but, for some reason I've avoided all of them. Then some girl I just met has been her boyfriend. Anyway, it's not just because I've lost interest in a girl, and there hasn't been a girl in there. I want to feel like I'm the only guy there, and it doesn't bother me, you know?"</p> <p>"Do you feel like you need to have another experience?" I asked. It wasn't a question of whether he was good at oral sex or not.</p> <p>"No. It's just that, if someone has a thing for me, then it would be kind of wrong of me to say no to you." He looked at me as he said that. I smiled and said, "Oh, I understand. I don't feel at all awkward with that."</p> <p>He looked at me for a long moment then looked up at the ceiling and smiled. It was a very pretty smile. I felt so at ease sharing this with him. I said, "Oh, I think kissing with you would satisfy you, would help you to get better. But, it would be kind of wrong for me to say no to you. Why am I saying no?"</p> <p>He smiled widely and said, "You're right. It wouldn't be right."</p> <p>I thought back to that, then smiled again at him and said, "It's just that, I'm not sure what to say. I think kissing would loosen me up, and it wouldn't be the first time someone else has done that. I might even be able to be that girl."</p> <p>He smiled at me then said, "I'd love to be your girl, but there's nothing wrong with giving oral. Have some friends."</p> <p>I looked at him for a long time then said, "Thanks, I think kissing will loosen me up."</p> <p>We kissed again then, and he rubbed my back as we kissed for some time. We broke apart after a short time. He said that he wasn't done and his penis was still quite hard. I told him I needed to help him get the hang of kissing. I took his hand and he moved up to lay on his back. I lay alongside him and he reached up and put his right hand on top of mine. We kissed again. I turned toward him and kissed him lightly again, then kissed him again. I didn't go anywhere, and his erection was not a big deal. It looked good enough. I kissed the tip then ran my tongue over it then took him in my mouth. I held it thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
