She replied. She had already started to change the subject a bit. "So tell me about your business in the City."</p> <p>I told her about the club and the meetings, but I thought she wasn't interested, not at all. "Just how serious are these meetings going?" I asked her.</p> <p>"You mean, the meetings? They aren't supposed to be for everyone, but most of them I do with the women I have met, just to keep you from suspecting that the wives I have done with before will be there too."</p> <p>That was something I'd never thought about, so I was surprised. "I only have that to do, you know." I assured her. She didn't say she wouldn't have to meet more people with the same commitment when she wanted to and was ready to meet her husband again, but she never asked about what I would be doing for the next four days.</p> <p>"You don't think I'll mind if you're my secretary for the next two days do you?" She smiled.</p> <p>"Nope." I replied.</p> <p>She was already thinking ahead. "I guess I'll just have to make sure that I am here when you arrive." She said in a rather seductive, yet firm, tone of voice. She was already pulling out of the parking lot. She must have already given her information. She had me by a good two hours, so I started off at the restaurant, but stopped there and looked around the restaurant to see our waitress waiting for us. It had already been a five hour drive by bus and she would see us arrive when she saw us.</p> <p>I had been driving the bus on the first stop, and we were soon joined by one of the most important people of the trip, my wife. "Hi, you must be Steve." She began.</p> <p>"I am Helen." Her husband replied very matter of factly. He was one of the most beautiful people I had ever laid eyes on and it was all I could do not to think about the way he'd been looking at me for the past hour. The way he seemed to be staring right up her skirt when she was sitting down across the aisle.</p> <p>"I'm Mike." She replied with a little more of an out loud giggle than I thought she would.</p> <p>"I was just following them, when I caught them talking to each other." He replied.</p> <p>"I'll bet." She agreed.</p> <p>"I didn't catch them in a bad light." I chuckled a bit nervously. "I'm just taking in just how beautiful you are, and how much better they look in my opinion." I added.</p> <p>"That makes two of us. What did happen between you and Dave that was so beautiful to me." She was looking straight ahead, down over the city, with a very nice view of the city below. "You never asked me out in high school, and I never asked you out. Now I know why it made me want to go out with you." She said, smiling as she said the last part.</p> <p>"No, I wasn't going to ask you for anything you said after what we did yesterday." I offered.</p> <p>"You're not mad?" She asked, a bit concerned.</p> <p>"No, not at all. I just didn't want to see anyone in that dress. I don't like to think that anyone else would have an opinion if they ever turned me down for it."</p> <p>"You're right." She replied, and took the opportunity to kiss me. It was a longer, lingering, lingering kiss then one she'd had from the outset. I tasted of mint, not honey, and it had a nice, salty-sweet taste. Her tongue darted between my lips.</p> <p>As we kissed she said she didn't know what we had talked about, but she did know that Dave loved to see her in nothing but a strapless dress.</p> <p>We broke our kiss and she suggested we go down to the bar and find a quiet corner to talk. We did just that, and while we talked, I slipped my arm around her and slid my hand up the top of her dress and over her breast. It felt so warm and soft against my palm.</p> <p>"I was right, it did feel nice." She whispered into my ear as we stood up, and lead me out of the restaurant.</p> <p>"This is my best friend here." She said as we approached the bar.</p> <p>"You are?" I asked.</p> <p>"You have no idea."</p> <p>"It's nice to meet you." I told her.</p> <p>"It's nice to see your friends too though." She smiled. "I love to sit down with you in the evenings."</p> <p>"It really is nice sitting with you. When you're not being bothered by your friends being around, you know."</p> <p>"When they are, I just think of you sitting here with these other peopleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
