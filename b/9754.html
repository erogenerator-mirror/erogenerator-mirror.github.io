I pulled my hands up and grabbed his hair, pulling his face back into mine.</p> <p>Our mouths met, our tongues sharing a brief but sweet kiss. I felt him beginning to pull out of me. "Fuck me," I begged.</p> <p>"Not yet, baby" He whispered into my lips, then slammed back in. "Are you ready, baby?"</p> <p>"Please," I teased, pushing back towards him. "More."</p> <p>"Not yet your gorgeous pussy is being ravaged by my cock." I moaned as he thrust forward again and we heard it. "Oh my god."</p> <p>He pulled out, looking at me in the eyes, his face bright red and pained. I ran my hands over his shoulders and down his back in the aftermath of our climax. Without warning my fingers found his ass as he came inside of me. That seemed to wake him back up as he slammed into me again and again. My orgasm continued to wrack my body. It was the most intense orgasm I'd ever felt so far in my life. He kept slamming into me as his breathing came in gasps. He started to moan and I felt him jerk as he emptied his juices into myself as he held himself in me. He collapsed on top of me as his breath returned to him.</p> <p>We lay there in one another's sweat, he still inside of me.</p> <p>"That was amazing. I can't believe your first time has really been like that."</p> <p>"It feels like everything has been amazing."</p> <p>He reached down to the front of my dress, pulling my shoulder back as he did. I felt his hands move my dress up and away and I smiled to myself at the thought that he had a good look at my breasts once they were freed. They weren't completely firm in some areas but they were just enough for him not to be distracted by them. That thought was enough for him to take a step back.</p> <p>I pulled the dress all the way up over my head, letting me see my breasts properly for the first time. He had seen enough of everything to know they were all perky and ready. My breasts were firm, his, and he loved them. His eyes were still drawn to them as he reached out to caress them. I closed my eyes at the feel of him on top of me. It felt incredible to have him all in me and the sensations I felt were just as powerful. He kissed me slowly, his lips pressing against my lips as our kiss grew in passion. He pushed me back and sat up on the bed. I watched him as he undid his pants, pulling his cock out of his boxers, which were already soaked. He tossed me the dress of which I had let fly the moment before, leaving it on the floor.</p> <p>We watched each other, taking in the sight of him as we lay there, his cock twitching with each breath. He pulled me to him, laying over me again as his cock head entered me. I couldn't take anymore as he thrust into me again and again, filling me with his cock. He kissed me softly as our pace quickened. Our lips broke apart and we laid there for a few minutes as the pleasure built and built. "You made me feel alive."</p> <p>"I hope you feel amazing, baby."</p> <p>"That's just you," I smiled as I opened my eyes. "You feel amazing."</p> <p>"I know, I always feel that way." He kissed me again and started to thrust into me again. I put my arms around him and squeezed him tightly as he pounded me. When I was ready, I pushed him down onto his back. I straddled his body, making sure my pussy was right over his cock, keeping it right on the tip. He started to moan loudly as we both rode him in our passion. I leaned forward, biting his neck, my breasts swaying, my hips thrusting as we rocked against him.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I hissed. He looked at me, one hand on each of my breasts as his cock pushed against me.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I repeated.</p> <p>"Please baby," he begged.</p> <p>"Please what?" I rolled my eyes in his direction.</p> <p>"Please fuck me." He leaned down and slid one of his fingers through my slit, feeling our wetness. He pushed a second digit into me as I pushed back against him so he could be pushed deeper. His fingers felt so good in my body, touching him that way. We fucked and I rocked on that cock, grinding it into me, wanting more. We were both lost in the sensations of him thrusting into me while his cock, being fully inside of me, kept giving me pleasure.
