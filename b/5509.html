I said with a coy smile on my face. "Are you going to call?"</p> <p>"Is your mom gonna get mad?" she teased.</p> <p>"Not right now. She's too busy with work. Besides, I'm already late for the wedding."</p> <p>"Maybe we could have lunch tomorrow if it's that important. It's been so weird." Her words were a little more flirtatious than normal while this was an important moment.</p> <p>"I'll talk to her and give her a call in a few," I promised.</p> <p>"Are we still friends?" she asked.</p> <p>I hadn't even realized what a friendship truly was until now.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "We still have a lot more in common than that."</p> <p>She was looking at me strangely, and I thought maybe she knew I had ulterior motives, so I went on.</p> <p>"And that's why we have such a little fling. She's going to marry me tomorrow."</p> <p>"The wedding?" she questioned.</p> <p>"Yeah," I admitted. "She's planning on getting married to you next weekend."</p> <p>She still wasn't understanding so I went on.</p> <p>"My dad's going to be furious, but he's also going to be a happy man. I'm sure he's going to love me," I concluded.</p> <p>"And you're okay with that?" she asked. "You're sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "He's already seen me naked."</p> <p>She was silent for a moment and then asked a question. "Is my dick bigger than yours?"</p> <p>I had her again.</p> <p>"Mom's tits are just big enough."</p> <p>Mom and I were in bed when she asked that question. She was wearing a night shirt while I was still in my shorts and my shirt was hanging on the bottom of the bed. That night shirt was already wrinkled, so we just took it off.</p> <p>"My dick is bigger than yours?" I said.</p> <p>"Yeah!" she answered. "Even with all the practice I did all last night, I'm bigger than yours."</p> <p>"Wow!" I complimented her. "How big is it?"</p> <p>"Just barely," she said. "And I've got a thick cock! You can't imagine how long it is!"</p> <p>"Okay," I said. "It makes too much sense."</p> <p>"I had a boyfriend of four months when I met my first sex partner. I was a virgin until he started fucking my mom. She was too afraid of what I might say to tell her. I was the first male in her life and she didn't know I was even there."</p> <p>"What did she do?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, I don't wanna be in a relationship where they're not talking," she stated.</p> <p>"Me neither!" I laughed.</p> <p>"I have no intention of keeping this relationship," she began. "Until I give you a real reason, and you can tell me what you want."</p> <p>"I've actually been kind of hoping you'd say that. I've been trying for years." I paused a moment before looking at her. "How many girlfriends do you have at home?"</p> <p>"There are only about nine, but she and I have been fucking the entire time we've been dating."</p> <p>"You and me?" I asked.</p> <p>"I have never, ever, fucked anyone else," she said. "I love giving pleasure. I'm not ashamed to admit it."</p> <p>With that, I had an incredible chance to ask her questions. What do you call it? An honest discussion, albeit a bit awkward, was about to become more difficult.</p> <p>"Can I ask you something personal?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course?"</p> <p>"Why am I here?"</p> <p>"Do you want me to go to your room and masturbate?"</p> <p>"I'd like that very much."</p> <p>"I'll tell you."</p> <p>I went about my business with mom on her knees. It took her awhile to get me erect, but finally she had me inside her. She was still a virgin, but she was able to get me to last long enough for her to climax. I never used my fingers, but mom did put some on her clitoris, just to let me know it was coming. She was so close to orgasm, almost yelling obscenities.</p> <p>"Oh God, I'm coming!" she said.</p> <p>Even on the verge of climax, I knew I was close to coming. My own mother had become used to my presence in the bathroom while the other person was doing her. I pulled out after one last thrust and came all over her stomach.</p> <p>Mom wiped my come fromâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
