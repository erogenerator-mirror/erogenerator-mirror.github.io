She gave a half-smile.</p> <p>"No? What's your name?" Alex asked, a bit shocked by what he was hearing.</p> <p>"I was born in Montreal, and moved to the east. My father is not a really good dad. He says my education is too valuable to be wasted on him. My mother is not good. I'm pretty sure my parents are also wrong." She answered him and laughed.</p> <p>"Yeah. I'll have to agree." Alex offered.</p> <p>"Well, I'm kind of new here, and there's really no way on this earth to really connect to people." she said as he leaned in to look her up and down a bit.</p> <p>"I take." he sighed, and walked around to her to sit down in his chair next to her. He reached out for her hand and she wrapped it around his thigh as he kissed her deeply.</p> <p>Her lips pressed hard against him and her tongue slipped into his mouth with a force that she wasn't familiar with. He ran his hands up and down her back under her shirt, and then reached down and slid her shirt off over her head. Alex began to caress her sides with the back of his hands and pulled her body closer to him. She moaned into his mouth, and she rubbed his hardon through his pants that she couldn't contain herself anymore. She could practically taste him on her tongue. His kisses became harder, and the faster they worked, the more she grinded against him.</p> <p>She broke the kiss almost instantly. "Alex, I can't." she said. "I think I need some space."</p> <p>"Oh, do I have to?" he asked, his hands sliding down her sides again.</p> <p>"Well, no but..." She started to say.</p> <p>"What?" Alex asked, pulling away from her as his hands made their way to the bottom of her shirt.</p> <p>"Let's just play." She told him. "Let me go."</p> <p>"Honey, we're going to stop for a minute, I've got a date at the club and there's a party." he told her.</p> <p>"But...I said lets play." she countered.</p> <p>"What? Not a chance. I mean...it's only a one-time thing. If we don't play, we'll never get to do anything. Besides we should be able to take part at the party. You know how horny I am being for you." he told her, trying to persuade her.</p> <p>"But...if we don't get there before the party, why don't we just hang out here? I know I'm feeling like a teenager and I'd like a whole bunch of fun before I'm too embarrassed to go home." she told him, squeezing him gently through their clothes.</p> <p>"Well I can't promise not to run into any problems, I'll give you a call and make sure everything is ok." he said, pulling her up and giving her a kiss as he slipped his hands back into her blouse and pulled them over. He helped her off of the couch and led her over to the bar. "So, if you're going to be here, it'll probably be just a one-time thing." he told her again as his hands slid up on her sides and pushed her back against the bar, making room as they made their way toward the room.</p> <p>She turned to Alex. "You sure you want to do this? Your work here is never guaranteed. But I'm actually quite sure that you want to let me do this for a living." she told him as they made their way toward a large glass on wooden tables in the center of the room. "Besides it will definitely be more fun if I tell you." she said to him.</p> <p>"Ok, see how I understand." he responded, his hands sliding down to her ass and squeezing it as they entered the room. "We'll just hang out here and get comfortable for a while." he told her, his body leaning against her as his lips met hers. Alex stood up, and then laid her back across the back of the bar. She lifted her legs, pulling him into her as she wrapped them around his hips, arching her back as he slowly began to fuck her into the bar. As her legs came up over his ass she leaned back into him, as if the effort could make her tits sway and bounce with each thrust of his hips. Their movements became more intense, and they were both moaning loudly now, as the bar moved at their pace.</p> <p>She felt Alex getting closer to climax. She reached down between them and ran her fingers across his hard-on, feeling it jump once more under her touch. As she played her finger across his head she could feel him getting as stiff as he was beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
