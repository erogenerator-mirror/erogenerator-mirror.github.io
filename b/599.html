All the tension was gone, and I found that I was able to reach out and put my finger to my mouth to quiet the laughter. As I did, I found myself laughing harder.</p> <p>I was able to focus on how to speak, but the words didn't make it to my intended speech, because the laughter continued to go on. Suddenly my laughter slowed, replaced by one of my own. It was a long time before my eyes began to clear, and I looked down at the beautiful brunette as I sat back against a shelf with a smile.</p> <p>"I take it you didn't go to dinner with your friends," I said as I stroked her cheek with the back of my hand.</p> <p>"It always feels this way when I'm home," she said with a smile. "I just like being with you in this way."</p> <p>"Thank you, I feel so lucky to take you in this way," I said as I stepped away and walked around the shelf to take up position against her.</p> <p>We embraced, and I held her tight as our tongues danced. I felt her arms snake down to my waist, to the front of my shirt which was very buttoned and untied, and she ran her hands up and down my torso. I pulled back and looked into her eyes, and was surprised when she gave me a sexy grin.</p> <p>"This is a nice feeling," she smiled as her fingers trailed over my shirt, making it feel as if it had been ripped.</p> <p>Slowly, I reached behind me, and released the tie that held my shirt on. Now the garment would stay on my back. I felt her fingertips run down my abdomen as she reached for my belt buckle, and I helped her by raising myself up. Our lips met again as she unhooked the button and slid the zipper down on the back of her pants. We broke our kiss as I slid my hands inside her pants and felt the soft, velvety skin of her ass cheeks. She had a nice, round ass, and I loved playing with it.</p> <p>As my hands caressed her ass cheeks, Jennifer moaned into my mouth. My hands roamed over her back, her neck, and down to her small but firm breasts that I couldn't help but squeeze. I squeezed the soft and roundness as I pinched the stiff nipples.</p> <p>"You like that?" I asked as my mouth found hers.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, but you can't do this!" she said as she pulled back from me.</p> <p>"Not here! This is a private place! It’s my office!" I said as I walked around the desk.</p> <p>I unbuttoned her pants and let them slide to the floor with the rest of her clothes, then lifted her onto the desk. She stood up so I could easily look at her legs, then at her chest. Both of her tits were still exposed under her shirt and had the outline of her nipples through it as I gazed at her large nipples.</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed her as I cupped her ass cheek with my hand. She leaned back on the desk and allowed me to kiss her again, this time her lips became more urgent with each second. I felt her tongue press against mine and it tasted of her. I ran my hand down to feel her pussy as the touch of my finger made contact with her clit.</p> <p>"I’m going to make you cum," I said as I began to run my finger up and down my clit.</p> <p>Jennifer pushed her hips backwards, forcing her crotch back with me as she let out a moan.</p> <p>"God" I heard her say as her hand dropped to the front of her pants as she began to stroke herself.</p> <p>Suddenly, the front door opened, and I felt her legs buckle. I lifted her leg and stood it in my hand, then slowly walked back to her as I put her down.</p> <p>"We’ll be right back," I said as I looked in her direction.</p> <p>As I walked around the desk, my shoes and pants hit the chair next to me. I leaned down and quickly pulled on my shoes and pants, and stepped out of them. As I walked back toward Jennifer with her clothes still in my hand, I looked over at her face, and she had a look of pure desire in her eyes.</p> <p>"Why don't we go into your office, and I'll work for you," I said as I took the last button on the dress shirt from her.</p> <p>She watched with a smile as I pulled the chair out and sat down against the desk, then took out a folder from a drawer, which I slid into the desk behind me. I sat back and closed the lid, then sat down on my chair again, facing Jennifer—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
