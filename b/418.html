His breath blew at her and felt like it was rasping her, "you don't mind?" "I liked it when you did that," she said. "I've always liked that."</p> <p>"Well, it makes it easier for me if I use it first." He took in her scent before licking her lips and chin again. "What do you think?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh," she responded. "It's so...nice."</p> <p>He laughed softly, "It gets better?"</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"Well, can you get my tongue a little lower," he asked, and she reached out with one hand and gave his erection a squeeze. He groaned and thrust against her, and she took his cock in her mouth almost as quickly as as she came in there.</p> <p>"I feel you there," she said. "It'll be so nice down there, too," she whispered. "Can you get it deeper?"</p> <p>As she worked him, she could feel herself slowly tightening her pussy around him, and she felt him start to buck against her, and he was doing it with a growing urgency now. "There," she whispered. "There." Her eyes opened in surprise, but she was already moving her hips and her own pussy was working on him with growing desire. He took in a sharp breath and thrust himself again and again, and she felt the pressure building between her legs, as her breathing quickened.</p> <p>"I'm...." It was barely a whisper. "Yess.....yes.......I'm....I'm going to -ooh. Oh god...." It was a word she hadn't learned yet, but she found herself smiling and her own breath came out in a rapid sigh. "Do it faster," she whispered, and she saw his hand disappear over his cock, up until her fingers wrapped around him and he jerked forward, and it felt like it felt even better than it had in her mouth. He kept coming, his hips going wild, as her fingers tightened and her pussy clenched and her body started shaking.</p> <p>Slowly, he lowered his body, and she felt his cock slip out of a wet, sloppy mess, sliding against her lips and then he was gone. "I think that's a good idea," she said, as she pulled her panties up around her thighs and sat up. "I'm still a little excited."</p> <p>"Honey, don't be. You're a naughty girl and everything will be fine," he said. "Let's get cleaned up and then get out of here."</p> <p>He picked up his clothes from the floor, and she stood up, wrapped her panties around her waist with a little difficulty, then went to the bathroom to clean herself again. They sat on the kitchen bench, and she couldn't resist a kiss. "Thank you," she whispered.</p> <p>They cleaned up the kitchen and put a lid between the panes, then she put together some salad, and they ate in the kitchen, where she watched him closely. Her heart was beating faster, and her cunt juices were beginning to get a little moist, but she decided she was hungry enough to eat for once without being too loud.</p> <p>"Well, that was fun," she said. "Are you ready to get back to school?"</p> <p>"Absolutely. I think I'll be staying around here a lot longer."</p> <p>"I'll bet," she said as she walked back to her room. "You were great, honey," she said as she closed the door behind her. When she sat down, she leaned back against her bed and let her hand slip to her lips. "You might want to put on a show for me," she said, and she felt her body respond to her. "And see if I can get you hard again," she said as her fingertip pressed a tiny circle on her clitoris. As her finger started working in and out of herself, she watched the way her eyes fluttered as she moved her hand away from the counter.</p> <p>"That was incredible," she whispered as her body responded more urgently. "Just let me know when we get together."</p> <p>"You better," he said. "Your pussy just got your juices all over me. I have a surprise for you tomorrow."</p> <p>She smiled, "I hope that's a good thing. I think we'd better get in bed."</p> <p>"Are you trying to get me all worked up again?"</p> <p>"Maybe," she said as she moved her hand to her pussy again, and she was pleased to feel her finger slip in easily. "But it's not your fault." Her eyes were closed as she fingered herself faster and faster. "You shouldn't even be touching yourself," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
