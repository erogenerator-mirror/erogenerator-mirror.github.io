"There's nothing that we have to worry about. We are alone here, we both are."</p> <p>"We don't even know each other." He grinned in the dim light. "This is where you come to your senses the first time. What do you think?"</p> <p>"I don't know." She replied, a little breathless. "I think I saw a flash of something, someone look at me."</p> <p>"You saw something, and it was so dark you couldn't tell whether it was real or a dream."</p> <p>"I wanted to do that." She said, in some urgency.</p> <p>The door opened, and a tall man came walking through.</p> <p>"I am so sorry I disturbed you, but your sister could be home by now, and I wanted to talk about my troubles tonight."</p> <p>"I didn't tell her." She said quietly. "She never comes this late on weekends and, well ... it's been a year. Just before Christmas my sister took me out of the city, and she asked that I come tonight. I'm sorry."</p> <p>She could get herself together now, she thought.</p> <p>"What is it you want to talk about?" he asked, looking her up and down. "Do you know about this woman, you're a detective and a friend, or do you care about your life?" He asked kindly.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" she asked. "Aren't you going to tell me?"</p> <p>"I think so," He shrugged. "It might just be fun. Now come on, how would you get to the apartment? I can't find you at your job, or anywhere near the apartment."</p> <p>"No, of course not." She agreed. "I'm still in this city at the moment."</p> <p>"I'm calling security." He said in a cold voice. "Now let's make you a drink. We'll drive in the back."</p> <p>He led her into a tiny lobby of the building and they sat in the back of a car on a raised bench. He looked at her and she nodded.</p> <p>"What?" She asked, the corners of her mouth turning up just slightly.</p> <p>"I'm a detective," he said. "I'm not interested in you."</p> <p>"So what am I going to do then?"</p> <p>"That's what you're going to do." He shrugged. "Don't be embarrassed. I'll tell you what if you don't show me the way."</p> <p>"Just tell me whatever you want." She said, but didn't look at him.</p> <p>He drove her to a small entrance and he pulled open a door.</p> <p>"Well?" he asked. "Is there a security camera?"</p> <p>"There must be a key on that bench there." She said.</p> <p>"But if I saw it at first it doesn't show." He said simply.</p> <p>He walked past her and she followed him in. She was amazed at the opulence of the interior and of the building, and she suddenly felt very at ease. He turned a circuitous route around the building and she had no difficulty finding her way around the long room.</p> <p>"I want to tell this story about your sister." It was an invitation he hadn't intended to offer. She nodded and he smiled at her.</p> <p>"So we're going to make love today."</p> <p>He reached into his back pants pocket and pulled a couple of photos. She had followed his gaze and she saw her own reflection at the photo.</p> <p>He pulled out a second set of photos and handed them to her.</p> <p>"These are my pictures." He said.</p> <p>She nodded, looking at the photos.</p> <p>"Your sister." She said aloud.</p> <p>"You mean like this one?" he asked. "We were going to do it in this dress." He laughed.</p> <p>"I don't understand." She said, confused.</p> <p>"Well," he said, looking at the photos. "We'll do it this way." He said, then turned to look at her and shrugged, taking her by the hand.</p> <p>He led her through a door and she followed him through the door and into a dark corridor. The way the doors were set up made her nervous and she nervously moved closer to him. He put one arm around her waist and pulled her against his chest.</p> <p>"Well how does this make you feel?" he whispered.</p> <p>"I'm just nervous." She answered. "I don't know if I can go through with this."</p> <p>"You can do it, if you want to." He answeredâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
