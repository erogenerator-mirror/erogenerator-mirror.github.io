I looked at a picture in my mind's eye, I wanted to be made up. I felt like some sort of prostitute. I was a hooker. I felt like a drug addicted whore who could barely walk. I felt like a schoolgirl with a raging crush on a teacher at prom. And then, there I was, looking like such a hooker, and then, with a cock. In an instant, I felt like a whore.</p> <p>The rest of the day passed very slowly, and then I spent some time thinking about my problem. I was nervous to start with, but then I realized that my mind was wandering to different thoughts on a deeper level and I was being led astray by a new direction to try.</p> <p>I got to my home early in the morning, I got dressed and I had my coffee. I walked down to my computer, I was looking for any more notes, when I heard a car. I looked up, it was a car! My heart fell out of my chest and I panicked, I jumped back into a chair, got a pillow, put it in my lap, I took my laptop and started to work. What should I do? What should I do? I needed to think about a more detailed plan, but how did I get here?</p> <p>I was a little apprehensive about trying to find a pen and paper to write down. I decided to come up with some more ideas about this. The next morning I went to my laptop's web browser and searched for a pen and paper, and found one. I quickly sat down at a café on the way back home that is just outside my town. I went to the kitchen and got the one I'm hoping will get me somewhere to sleep that night, so that I could start an email and get to work early tomorrow.</p> <p>I got home, showered and changed into a slinky little miniskirt, a cute see though silk top, and a lacy pink top. I laid out what I had gotten at home. A pair of short black leather stilettos, with the requisite black heels, I put my laptop on the kitchen table and sat down. I picked up my phone.</p> <p>"Hello this is my personal phone. My home number is 4-ax," I said.</p> <p>"I understand. I will call you tomorrow. Goodnight," said a smiling woman.</p> <p>"You were asleep. Well, I hope you didn't go to bed early? That would not be wise."</p> <p>"My fault. I woke up when I put the phone close to my ear and listened to how you got on. I just turned it off. I was so disappointed."</p> <p>"Don't get too excited. It's not like he's your first call. I was going to send you up the block and send you right back to that bed with him. That's the idea."</p> <p>"I understand. I understand."</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that. I didn't set down the first order of business. I want this to be a surprise."</p> <p>"Oh, okay." I sat up in my bed. Now it was time for a plan.</p> <p>At around noon, I went to my email account. I copied my address from the email, and added this one to it as well. This was it! I could start a new life with him. I logged off my office computer and started a new project.</p> <p>Over the next five days, I thought about a plan that I couldn't see. I made more notes and started a new project that I needed to get to work. I did the whole thing on my own. I wrote a draft about this scenario that seemed to come up fairly slowly. I wrote about what it should be and was going to try on the same device that I had seen on a picture and had been given before.</p> <p>But then I stopped. My plan had been made. Now it was just going to be a bit of an experiment.</p> <p>My plan had started from the beginning, that's actually where the "project" in the email came from.</p> <p>The first couple of days had been very awkward to say the least. I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue, but there were plenty of other people around today that got off pretty readily. It was a good thing that I didn't have to worry about what people were doing in my home. People are a little hard to spot, and they can get a little weird sometimes. People are really easy to spot, but the more they get to the surface, the further you get to them.</p> <p>A few of the people I talked to earlier told me that this sort of thing has been going on for a while. I guess it is a habit that we are all aware of, even if we never—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
