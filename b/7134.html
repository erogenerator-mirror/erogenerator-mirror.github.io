Her hands moved up, rubbing the tip of his tongue onto her clit with a wave of pleasure. She closed her eyes, enjoying the soft touch of his tongue, and feeling his cock hardening. She opened her eyes as he moved back to the top of his chair, watching for the next movement as his hard cock slid from her and lay on her.</p> <p>She opened her eyes, looking up to see that his eyes were closed and his head was tilted back slightly to maintain any contact of his dick on her body. He brought his hands from the back of the chair back down to her legs, spreading them with one move. He lifted them with his hands, the heels of his hands pointing straight at her. He moved in between her legs, guiding his hardness between them as he lifted them to him.</p> <p>He brought both her knees up to his chest, holding them there, the tips of the feet in between. The tip was now just brushing her pussy lips at first, making her stomach flutter; then her lips would open wider and his tip would touch her clit, sliding down, brushing her slit. Her hands dropped to his shoulders, holding him tight against her as he continued stroking. His head turned to the side in a questioning kind of way. She smiled as he nodded.</p> <p>"Put it in me. Put it in me," she purred. He looked up at her, his eyes still focused on something, and found her eyes on the same as his, his cock head nudging her pussy. He moved his hips just a little, sliding it back and forth, feeling the head of it with each stroke. He leaned forward, reaching down and pressing the head of his dick against her opening. The tip of his dick parted her, parting her lips before entering her, sliding in. She clenched onto his shoulders and began to grind against him as she brought her hands into his hair, holding her as he pulled back on her, almost forcing himself in with one push. His head almost disappeared in then nearly out of her, and her body would tense, the warmth of his dick filling her. She wrapped her legs around his chest, trying to keep his eyes on her as he fucked her, their eyes lost in pleasure as he filled her, the sensation of his cock hitting her pleasure center, hitting her cervix, pushing her over the edge.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she demanded. He lifted her legs and pushed her up against him, reaching over to the desk and getting it and a condom in the pocket on the side table. "Please, fuck me now. I'm so hot…"</p> <p>She raised her hips off the chair, wrapping her arms around his neck and pulling him toward her. He slid in to his full length, her wetness coating his cock. He pressed against her, feeling the pressure of her muscles in his penis begin to expand as she wrapped herself around him. "Oh God…" he whispered as he began to move. She reached back and pulled him tighter against her, his cock sliding deeper inside of her hot, wet tunnel, her clit pressed against his dick. Their lips met as they kissed, his tongue probing hers as his cock entered her again, sliding in and out with the force of his will. She pushed back against him as they kissed. Her body began to tremble with her orgasm, her thighs tightening on his dick. He leaned his head down to suckle one of her nipples, his other hand working her clit as he moved in and out of her. She let go of his mouth, her fingers now massaging the length of his hair as he thrust into her with one final plunge of his cock.</p> <p>"God, I'm cumming again," she said, her orgasm hitting like nothing you have ever felt. She slid her arms up his neck and held on tight as his hips pulsed as she gripped his dick, trying to drain it as it was pulling out and plunging back into her. He felt the walls of her pussy tighten and then loosen around his dick as the waves subsided. She pulled his face down to hers and kissed him.</p> <p>He sat down on the edge of his bed, his dick still hard with the heat it had just received. He put the condom on, putting his wet dick away. He sat down on the bed next to her, still in the doggy position.</p> <p>"Well, did you enjoy your little show? No?"</p> <p>"It wasn't so bad," she said, her voice a little shaky.</p> <p>"What happens tomorrow?" he asked, sitting next to her on the bed.</p> <p>"Tomorrow," she agreed, running her hands through her hair.</p> <p>"But tomorrow," he asked, not moving—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
