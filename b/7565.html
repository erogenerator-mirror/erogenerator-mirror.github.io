She asked, feeling his eyes burning through her skin.</p> <p>"Because I'm being difficult... I want to do this," he added. He looked over at the clock on the side console and smiled wanly.</p> <p>"Well," the girl said, sounding surprised. "What? No, wait, you're coming, you're not!"</p> <p>"It's going well, I'm sure of it, but still..." he said.</p> <p>"But I need it..." she said, leaning over to him. "I do. I want it, I need your cock inside me."</p> <p>"You want me to fuck you," he said flatly.</p> <p>"Yeah. I want to feel that beautiful cock of yours deep inside me," she replied. She grabbed the table back in front of him. "Get over there, I want to ride you," she said, motioning with her hands.</p> <p>"But what about your family?" he asked, knowing full well where she lived.</p> <p>"I've never been close to my husband," she giggled. "But I want to do this," she said, reaching her arms around his neck, placing her soft lips on his for a deep kiss. "Yes, I'm willing to take care of you if you will take care of me.

His tongue ran in slow lazy strokes across her own. She leaned back in order to meet him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, her lips still toying with his. "I'm going to take it slow but I really like it. And you have a gorgeous body," she told him. "I want you to take me," she added softly. "Take me," she said firmly. "Take me into your thick fucking cock," she whispered, her voice becoming raspy. "Take me, right now..."</p> <p>He lowered his face to her. Their lips met and he tasted the sweet, sweaty essence of her body. His hand slid into a cupping her mound while her hand moved to meet his. "Oh, god," she whispered, softly. She felt his fingers slowly moving, feeling a taut tension in it. She was so hot... So aroused... His kiss was passionate and demanding, and it was all hers! "I want you inside of me, I want you to..." she said, again, almost begging. "I want your cock inside of me," she repeated, her voice pleading. She began to slide him in and out of herself.
