The silence was deafening, as if someone was calling out the alarm but I couldn't do anything to help. I felt more then my body relax, and soon her voice was coming higher and higher.</p> <p>'It's alright, baby, just relax,' her voice said, and I could feel her thighs pressing against mine, against my own. She squeezed my face between her arms and my eyes shut, but I couldn't hold my breath for fear of falling forward.</p> <p>'It's alright, baby, don't you worry,' she said, 'it's okay.'</p> <p>Then she shifted so that her head was buried against her chest, and I could just feel her hard nipples on my arms, and her legs. I could feel her fingers caressing my scalp as her breath came out in soft, sexy growls. I felt one of my arms was pulled up, and I felt her pulling me down, so that my face was now pressing against her soft belly. My mind was focused on what she was doing, and it seemed as if for the first time I heard this deep female sigh.</p> <p>'It's okay, baby, I won't hurt you, just let the muscles in your legs relax,' she said softly, and I knew there was nothing I could do. I felt her arms start to crumple in my thighs, and heard her voice in my head, 'I'm not going to hurt you - I'll just get used to it,' she continued, and I felt her arms start to slacken, and then I felt a few of her fingers press down on my shoulders, as I tried to pull my head forward.</p> <p>'No...no,' I heard a voice say, and I was in a semi-awareness of the darkness, still aware of her warm body, pressed against mine, as I became aware of her fingers pressing me down gently, and a groan escaped me as my head bent, with a heavy weight.</p> <p>I slowly opened my eyes again and looked down. It was still dark outside, as if still a little later, and I thought about getting back up, and getting out of there. My arms would not release me, so I closed my eyes, and started to rock my head to try and find a way to get on the surface of the water. It was a little difficult, not to look as if there was something wrong, but by the sound of her voice, she wasn't talking, as the other girl had. But I wasn't going to be able to just move myself so that the water washed away everything that had happened, and I started to panic. I felt my heart skip a beat, and I knew that I wouldn't be able to find a way out of here if things had gone too far.</p> <p>My mind was in turmoil. Where was she all the way? And, then my body started to come back to me that very second. As it did, I started to realise that I was still naked, and that I wasn't on the surface. After the shock of the moment had passed, I became aware of the warmth in my arms, and knew that, while I was still sitting in the water, there was nothing else that I could do now. I was cold and I was naked. I was naked.</p> <p>That all thought disappeared as suddenly as it had arrived. I stared into the darkness, and saw the pale skin of her face, as it was just then, and I felt my legs getting a little weak, as if I wouldn't be able to fight it. I was on the edge of panic, feeling as if I was going to die.</p> <p>'No - no!...not my breasts...' I heard her voice say in my head, and I felt my face flush with shame, and my arms started to fold from the pressure. She kept her arms loosely behind me, as if they could hold me still. I could smell the faint scent of perspiration on them, and her arms would now be pressing me down, making me feel as if I was going to fall.</p> <p>'It's okay, you don't have to look,' she said, 'all the blood is still in there.' She was speaking to me, and I felt the weight of her body press against me, and then feel my own body responding. She was still there, and I could feel her breasts, pressing me down, as if they were not there, and I was feeling more and more, as her hands kept pressing against my shoulders.</p> <p>She was speaking in a soft voice, and I could hear the sound of her fingers caressing me, so, I thought, she is not going to hurt me and I won't have to fight. I was still holding on, and the weight of her body pressed up against me.
