I'm just happy to know a friend and not have to work on the farm."</p> <p>"I see."</p> <p>"Are you happy about it?"</p> <p>"Absolutely!"</p> <p>"So when you want to ask me out, do you want me to pick you up and take you for a nightcap?"</p> <p>"As long as we go as far as I want."</p> <p>"That's perfect. When do you want to give me a call?"</p> <p>I look her over and she gives a smile. "Soon. I'll pick you up in about twenty minutes."</p> <p>I get up and go back into the office to hang out until the evening. As the clock ticked down, I think of how our evening could possibly go out. I can't get my mind off our night, no matter how many times I make love to her. My cock begins to stir at the thought that she wants me more, maybe even more...</p> <p>************</p> <p>I arrive at the house a little after six. She is inside having a drink in one hand, while the other is on her hip with a sly smile on her face. I walk into the kitchen and sit down next to her.</p> <p>"Well, well. You look as ready as I did last time. Did you have a fun day?"</p> <p>"Yes, he was amazing tonight!"</p> <p>"What's up with you tonight?"</p> <p>"I was getting pretty tired but couldn't wait another night."</p> <p>"I can imagine. What can I do to make you happy?"</p> <p>I lean over and kiss her on the lips and she gives me an uncertain look.</p> <p>"Okay, what can I do to make you happy, besides get off my mind?"</p> <p>"Mmmmm.... I've been thinking about something a little different tonight."</p> <p>We are sitting there talking for a few while and she is slowly taking a lot of her time. She is a very beautiful sight. I'm wondering what it would feel like to have her in my arms; to have our hands exploring each other's body.</p> <p>"What about you?"</p> <p>"I'm a little lonely."</p> <p>"Why? You're a very attractive woman. I can feel something on my leg; it's not sexual."</p> <p>She looks at me, and her eyes are a little wider than I anticipated, causing the hair to fall across her shoulders. "You're very smart, you have an engaging personality. It's what you do when you want to. I've just missed you." She gives a shy smirk, and I'm sure, on purpose.</p> <p>"I know. I've wanted you too... for some time."</p> <p>"What are you up to, then?"</p> <p>"Nothing much. I'm only here to watch you."</p> <p>"Well... I... I haven't been the best company."</p> <p>"Don't worry. I'll have you on my bed at the end of the night."</p> <p>"Don't you have to work the next day?"</p> <p>"No, I'm staying home this weekend. This is my first semester, and I want to spend the weekend with you."</p> <p>"You were here."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm glad to be here, and I want to make love to you right here in this house."</p> <p>She gives me a seductive smile and leans back in her desk chair. She opens her coat up and lets her tits out; I see the top of her tits. The nipples are very dark, very hard with excitement. They seem larger than normal, but more firm without being. I feel a surge of eroticism. I see her eyes open wide in shock. She leans forward and kisses me very gently and I know our lips are very close. We're in an office and I am feeling a little like a deer in a bush. I pull away and sit back down.</p> <p>"I told you how I felt the last time we were in here, and it sounded like it could be worse. Now that I've got you here, it seems I'm having a lot more fun here than I thought I would."</p> <p>"You sound excited about some fun."</p> <p>"I was just thinking..." and she pauses.</p> <p>"How about I fuck you in the restroom, like before?"</p> <p>She smiles and gets up and goes into the restroom. A minute later, after she has taken it in turns to open up her skirt, she comes out and opens up the bottom. I look down at her panties which are very thin, and I can see her dark bush.
