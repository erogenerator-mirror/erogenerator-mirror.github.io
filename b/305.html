I suggested.</p> <p>"Sure, that's cool. Go grab a couple glasses."</p> <p>"Uh..." I started, thinking he was going to refuse.</p> <p>"Don't worry, we're just kidding. Besides, this place has some of the best liquors around."</p> <p>"Liar." I said with a laugh. "Let me grab a couple glasses of wine." I turned to leave off her drink and she took the glass I offered. "So you're not a guy."</p> <p>"No, I am not."</p> <p>"Oh? I'm sure you're only thinking of the most perfect way to get laid tonight. Or have you?"</p> <p>"No, not at all." I said, trying to make myself sound convincing.</p> <p>She laughed. I was sure it was a laugh. He was so confident, so full of himself. I looked back at the table and noticed there were several other attractive women around us. Several others had their boyfriends between them. One brunette wore a pink mini skirt and a green silk blouse over it. Another wore a black mini skirt, a green tank top, and a pair of green sandals.</p> <p>My eyes returned to the table where she was sitting. I noticed one of the older women had just brought over a bowl of ice cream and several glasses of champagne.</p> <p>"I'm Amy." I said, looking her over appreciatively. She had a slight tan, short brown hair, cute round blue eyes, and a cute little nose. She looked pretty, and if I wasn't already over-used and feeling awkward about leaving her unattended, I certainly wouldn't want to say I was. She must have been in her mid-thirties.</p> <p>"James?" She asked as she set the bowl on the table, turning to face me. "You know, I'm assuming you're not a guy?"</p> <p>I shrugged sheepishly.</p> <p>"Well, let's just say it's been a while." I said, leaning over. "This isn't one of those places you go when I have a guy over to do this." I wrapped my right arm around his broad shoulder. "Besides, I'm not even sure what I am." I whispered.</p> <p>He put his hand on my right knee and smiled. I felt his warm, soft fingers slide up my knee and up my thigh. I was surprised that I was still wearing my clothes.</p> <p>"So, what did you do on your own?" I asked. "I mean, come on, I'm sure you have a lot of experience."</p> <p>James laughed. He leaned over and kissed me, and I felt myself respond. My breasts were pressing against him as his lips brushed mine, and his hands slid around my waist to cup my ass as he kissed me passionately. I felt his hand slide up the back of my body and around to cup one of my small but perky breasts, lightly pinching my still erect nipple through the thin fabric of my dress until it stood fully erect. I pulled away, feeling my insides turn to a puddle.</p> <p>"Mmm, I'm so horny." I moaned as his hand stroked my leg until he reached the top of my thigh. "Let's go into the back." I suggested as I took his hand and led him into the back room. "But I don't have anywhere else to go, really."</p> <p>"Oh, I want some of that." He said, dropping onto one knee before me. His large cock was straining against his pants.</p> <p>"You know, you sure could use some of this yourself." I whispered, looking up into his eyes.</p> <p>He smiled and looked back down at his enormous erection, which made me feel self-conscious. But I wanted to see what he had in store for me.</p> <p>"You got the idea." He told me as he ran his hand up and down my back, down and around my waist. "We have about fifteen minutes before we do this."</p> <p>I nodded enthusiastically and put my arms around his neck. "Ok." I said, leaning in for another kiss. I felt his tongue probing and seeking out mine, but he had other plans.</p> <p>"Here." He told me again and pulled me up so my knees rested on the end of a large bed. I didn't notice, but he quickly pulled my dress down so it could barely move when I pushed my hips away. I leaned up against him so my breasts had his attention as his hands slid up my thighs to cup eachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
