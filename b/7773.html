"She's really into it and I've had sex with her plenty of times. I love it, but sometimes I want a third wheel."</p> <p>She smiled. "Maybe we should give each other a call," she said with a shrug. "It's not like we can't ask for you in any of our lives, or our kids, and we already have a lot of things in common. We're all open to meeting other people, but we'll take whatever opportunity we can to become a couple."</p> <p>"I wouldn't mind meeting up with you," I said. My wife was the last one living that part of our suburban life.</p> <p>"I'll see you soon, Rob" Heather said. "Enjoy the summer and get to know you better."</p> <p>The conversation was quiet with only a few laughs. "Let's have a glass of wine," I said.</p> <p>"What did you have in mind," Heather asked. I looked at her to find her looking out the window at the lights that lined the patio out front, casting long shadows and making shadows across her body. She must think that's why she's still wearing her summer dress.</p> <p>"Just a couple shots," I said, knowing she couldn't disagree at that moment. There's something about sitting behind your wife with your thoughts and heart racing. When she says that, I think there's something sexual there, whether it's a sex fantasy or anything else.</p> <p>"Yes," she said. She looked at me over the rim of her glass and then back at the glass, looking back down, again. In some ways she'd already answered the question. We'd already decided the summer could be as much fun as what we'd planned.</p> <p>I sipped on the wine, not really thinking, letting it flow through my fingers as my head was still spinning. As I did then, I realized that she'd just asked for me to join her in the nude at the beach. She was no virgin and would love to see me without my clothes on and have me touch her. I took a big swallow and held my breath.</p> <p>"Don't you want to get your cock inside me?" Heather asked, still in the kitchen working through the kitchen cabinets. She was leaning against the island with her elbows on the counter between her feet. Her t-shirt was pulled up so low it was visible, and I couldn't see much through it. I swallowed again and looked at her.</p> <p>She smiled back and said, "The first time isn't the most exciting thing, but you sure can try." Heather turned and came back with a half finished glass of Pinot Noir and a bottle of Cabernet and three shot glasses. She poured two of the wines in one glass and went back out to the deck. I watched her the whole time she was back down, admiring the way that her back curved into her butt that wasn't hiding so much as being revealed every time she got up.</p> <p>In the living room, we had decided that nothing was sacred. She said nothing but we had decided to call it the retreat. She got to her knees in front of me and said to me, "Robby, I've been thinking about this all weekend."</p> <p>"What," I asked her. She didn't wait for me to answer her question. She had another idea. She got me under the blanket and pulled me on top of her. They weren't kissing, like she thought they weren't going to be, but they didn't seem to be too interested in finding out what was between her parted thighs. We were both naked in no time, her body on top of mine, her legs spread open, and my cock pressing into the soft skin of her belly. I didn't need any additional stimulus, and when she felt it pressing against her pussy she moaned softly.</p> <p>She ran her hand down my back and found the crack of my ass. "Are you sure you're not up to it, baby?" she said, pulling the cheeks apart and rubbing my asshole with her finger. "I want you to make sure this goes good. I'm going to show you how it feels." She went to the stove and found the skillet with the pan. "But you better start going slow so I don't worry about breaking up." She held the pan upside down close to her face and took one of the glass of wine I'd bought her for her birthday, as a dessert. She then lifted her head up and slowly pulled my cock inside her mouth and into her throat.</p> <p>I kept my hips on top of hers, pressing into her. The heat emanating from between her legs made my head swim. I tried my best to keep from going crazy and then I heard her saying, "I think we ought to doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
