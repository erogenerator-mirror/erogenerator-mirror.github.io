It didn't take long before he felt her tightening around him as the sensation built in her pussy. He pulled out, allowing her time to adjust as she leaned over on her side to take him back between her legs. He moved to his knees behind her and pushed the end of his cock into her ass. She jerked a little and moaned, her eyes still closed. He slowly slid back until just his head was inside her, he pushed forward. The warmth of her ass surrounding his shaft was incredible. He could not believe how much that felt as he held himself still, waiting for her sphincter to open up and allow him in. "Oh god!" she cried out. "Oh my god!" After a few moments, she managed to reach between her legs to feel his cock pulsate once again in her ass. She was so tight, the muscles gripping and releasing with each heartbeat.</p> <p>"My turn," Paul whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she managed to respond.</p> <p>He pulled out for the last time and stood up, pulling her up to lie on the bed. He positioned himself on top of her, his cock sliding easily in and out of her now wet pussy. He moved one hand to her lips, pushing his fingers inside her mouth. He started to finger her mouth again, his movements getting faster. Without even realizing it, she became lost in the orgasm as well.</p> <p>"Oh yes" she hissed out. "Yes."</p> <p>Paul drove himself inside her then. Hard as he could, he grabbed onto her hips, pulling her backwards each time his cock drove home into her pussy. He kept fingering her mouth and finger fucking her ass, which he was finding more and more difficult to do with each second passed.</p> <p>"I'm getting close again!" he warned.</p> <p>"God yes," she moaned. "You go slow now."</p> <p>He was just barely able to maintain the fucking session in her pussy as well as her mouth at the same time. Eventually, his cock lost its ability in her.</p> <p>"Oh god!" she moaned. "Ahhhhh yes!"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>They looked in each other's eyes as they fell asleep in each other's arms. Paul knew that if he kept it up a minute, it wouldn't last.</p> <p>"I'm not done with you for another hour and you never would have been able to cum without my help," Paul mused to himself.</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>He could barely wait until morning. The next day, he would make up his mind about how he wanted to spend the rest of his time without his wife. The time he spent with her would be foreverâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
