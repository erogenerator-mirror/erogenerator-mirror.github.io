I just stared into the mirror and began to cry. I could not help myself. It wasn't fair that I had to be ashamed by my actions. I felt like someone had taken a knife and cut me. I had no choice but to do what I had to do. After all, it was not my fault that the man's name was Charles. It wasn't fair, it wasn't right. I was not what they think I was. If I was that I would have tried harder than I did. I just did not like being told what to do, what to even do that felt wrong.</p> <p>He stopped by my side and asked if I could bring a friend over to spend the weekend. He said he had to pick up his new baby. I felt like I had no choice and said that I would just stay home. As soon as I opened the front door I realized I forgot my purse as I closed the door and slammed it again. It was the only way I could think of to get away from the man I had become. There was no way in hell I would let him go. I was sure it would be over quickly and in the way that I thought at the time. The way the man at the door saw me standing there tears were running down my face now. How could I have ever let this happen?</p> <p>I sat down on the couch to try to control the tears and tried reading the words on the wall in front of me while I tried to make sense of everything. I started with what I had learned at school. "That's your fault" I thought. "Your stupid for thinking your fault for what I did to you." I thought back to how I felt. I knew there was no way I could change what I thought. I just had to try harder or face the truth.</p> <p>After about five minutes of trying to think of the real world, I had the words. The one that was not so scary. The one that was so real. My head was spinning. "This is real." I thought. I wanted to tell him but I couldn't make myself say it. I just kept walking.</p> <p>I finally heard the name. I had just heard it but couldn't remember it. I looked up the man sitting across from me. "He's mine," I tried to say but failed. He smiled and said, "Hello." He looked at me with big brown eyes and said, "Hello. I really like that name." I smiled back at him and said, "Yes I guess I should be called Mike, but I have another thing to speak of." I saw him take three big gulp and his eyes look long and deep at me.</p> <p>I just kept walking until we entered his living room. I just stopped and looked to him. My mind was spinning. He was not really her anymore. His wife. Not like her anymore.</p> <p>"I'm sorry Mike, I guess I should have told you the name." I said trying to get the words out and to put things in perspective of what had happened today. He laughed and then said, "I have never met a black woman. I do not go out with white guys."</p> <p>I just looked at him and just said, "Then what does it matter? I am not looking to be a homo; I just want to start out with black pussy again. Just not with that big black cock in my mouth." That made him laugh again. He walked towards me and started to kiss my neck. I just leaned back against him and said, "That would have been a very safe thing to say."</p> <p>He pulled his arms from around me and stood up. He looked at me for a moment. I just shook my head and said, "You wouldn't dare." He chuckled then walked to his bedroom and began his task.</p> <p>I stood there for a minute or so looking at the man outside of his door. He looked at me again and said, "I can't take this anymore my little black slut. This makes me incredibly angry with you. No, I can't take anymore. It's not fair any more."</p> <p>I just looked up at him with my mouth ajar and he just said, "Come and sit next to me. I won't tell anyone anymore."</p> <p>He sat on the bed and after about ten minutes we relaxed enough that we could talk. He was a quiet man, if ever there was a term for "silent" but talking was just what I needed right now. After an hour or so of talking we both realized that we were both tired, sweaty, exhausted. I said, "I have a headache." He laughed and said, "I didn't put any pill in here. It's a habit of mine. I just don't care to drink."</p> <p>After a very long while he asked, "I just want youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
