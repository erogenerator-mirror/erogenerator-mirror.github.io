I asked.</p> <p>"You got it. Now get me out of here, and get me my clothes."</p> <p>I picked up her panties and set them in the hamper, and put them inside a little hamper baggie, and closed the lid.</p> <p>I walked out into the kitchen, and had to give a quick "fuck" to the living room to find them, and make sure they were on the couch in front of the fireplace.</p> <p>A few minutes later I heard the front door open, and an old guy come in from the back yard.</p> <p>I was walking up to where they were, and smiled when I saw him pull the little baggie out of the hamper and start to pull things out as well as sit down on the couch. I stood there wondering if he would come back, just sit down and watch.</p> <p>But he did not. Instead, he reached out and picked up the baggie baggie and held it in front of him, and he stared at the top. I could see his eyes running over the top.</p> <p>"Here," he said, "Open the top and look. I know you like it."</p> <p>I had a big sigh, and pulled out the top of the baggie and looked inside.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, it looks like fun to use my old clothes in this way."</p> <p>Again he had a big "fuck" look on his face.</p> <p>I went down on my hands and knees on the floor, and pulled my skirt up and folded it over. I looked as well as I can in the reflection and looked up into his eyes, and saw a big smile on his face. My heart went out to him, as he had told me to do.</p> <p>"Put this baggie on the floor," he said, and he handed it to me. "I never used this in the hamper before," he said, pointing to a corner of the hamper. "I guess you don't like it, do you?"</p> <p>I looked up at him, and told him that my "pussy" smelled pretty good too, and that "pussy" was probably better than anything in a man's bathroom or mine, if I had anything to say about it.</p> <p>I took the bag, folded it into a ball, and put it, too, on the floor with the baggie on top.</p> <p>I didn't notice that the corner of the hamper was closed, so I picked it up, and laid it carefully down on the floor between the two corners.</p> <p>I looked at him.</p> <p>"You just gave me a nice tip, and a good tip for that tip I got," he said when he saw me looking at him.</p> <p>"There are better things than that," he said, "and much better fun. I hope you like it.</p> <p>I did agree with him, and he gave me the baggie back.</p> <p>He handed me the bag, and I picked them up, and laid the top on the floor at the end of the room. I looked at him and asked the last question. "Does that feel good? You can use my old clothes whenever you want."</p> <p>"That's a good point, honey," he said, "as long as you know that you just offered a nice tip.</p> <p>That's how I came to learn that I need to find things to do in that bathroom or I'll spend the night doing nothing, and going off. A nice guy like you needs to find something to do when no one is around. Find something to do, and be done."</p> <p>I smiled at him, and put my fingers in my mouth, then started to give him my answer. "I see, what do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, I could teach you a little bit, but it can be kind of... awkward," he said, "and I won't have the opportunity to teach you the real thing."</p> <p>He picked me up a little, and pushed me up against the door, then reached down and grabbed the top of my dress. He pulled off the hem, stood up, and pulled down my skirt to the floor. He stood there just in front of me in his little white undershirt and boxers, and asked, "Honey, why don't you come out there, and we can sort through this."</p> <p>"What do you mean, I don't want to go out there like this?"</p> <p>"Don't worry," he said, "we won't be out in a few minutes. You can help me pull this off."</p> <p>He was standing with his hands on either side of me with his feet just on either side, and his hands were on either side of me, his palms together just below my knees.
