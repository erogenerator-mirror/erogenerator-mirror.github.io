My body is aching. I've been rubbing in your blood, to make it clear that you are not to be pushed around."</p> <p>"I think I understand," he grinned, grinning back at her, "now, we may not want to get up for breakfast yet."</p> <p>Nadia's smile deepened as she held out her arms and they embraced again, kissing gently, caressing every inch of their bodies. He put one arm behind her back and ran his fingers beneath her collar bone, teasing to his advantage, "And you've been rubbing in my blood to prove the whole experience wrong." She grinned back and ran her hands up and down his back, squeezing his ass, before pulling away and moving to his belt. "Oh, I can't wait to see what else I can do to you," she whispered as her hands unzipped his pants and let them slide down over his ass as she leaned in, "I've been dying to fuck you all day."</p> <p>"Damn, you have no idea," he grinned "If only I could keep my hands off of your body." He lifted her up by her arms and held her, one arm around her waist and the other around her neck.</p> <p>"Oh you sure do," she smiled, sliding her lips along his neck, "I can't wait for you to fuck me." His lips met hers and she moaned in his mouth as their tongues danced. His hands held her tight and his penis rubbed her abdomen as they kissed. Nadia was so wet and she wanted him to fuck her, that she could hardly stand the feeling of his erection pressing against her. She let her arms fall to her sides as their tongues dueled. They kissed again, Nadia now breathing very hard and feeling dizzy, as she ran her hands over his broad shoulders and back, loving the way he smelled and tasted.</p> <p>Suddenly, she pulled back, her lower body weak with lust. It had been such an exquisite experience. Nadia grabbed his face and kissed him softly, not breaking contact just feeling the way his body pulsed in her hands and hands. "Can I?" he moaned, "Please?" She shook her head as his lips brushed her lips, "Please fuck me. You know, it wasn't hard to tell from what I've done with myself in the past that I just wanna fuck. Would you like that?" His hands were cupping her, knotted on her hips. He pulled them both toward him, and she pushed her pelvis toward him, her fingers wrapped around his shaft. His mouth left hers, kissing her throat and licking up to her collar bone. Nadia shivered as if he were biting her and he bit hard.</p> <p>"Nadia!" he groaned, her skin tingling with pain. She laughed and ran away, running down the trail to a nearby cabin. His hands found her, and he lifted her, setting her on a tree, her naked body spread out on the ground. He positioned her head above his penis, his lips meeting hers again, and his penis slowly stroked her hot slit. "Mmm," she sighed as he entered her. "Ohhhhh, fuck me, lover, fuck me hard. It feels sooooo good."</p> <p>"I can't believe how beautiful you are. I'm going to fuck you so hard, you'll think I never stopped. Please?"</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," she whispered as his hips moved around her body, her arms around his hips and her arms around his shoulders, thrusting her pussy against him as his erection thrust against her cervix. "You have no idea. You're beautiful; you're so goddamn sexy."</p> <p>He was so close that he thought he might faint if they continued. "God, I love seeing you naked," he moaned as he plunged in and out of her body, "that's so fucking sexy."</p> <p>"I'm going to put my legs up here and you can do me." She pulled him down and her pussy slid along his thighs. "And when I get you off on me, you're gonna do me as well."</p> <p>"Are you sure? I don't want to hurt you."</p> <p>She squeezed his hardness between her legs for added emphasis and, "That won't be necessary," she kissed him, "You'll just do it."</p> <p>He thrust up into her as she pressed down, "Oh, fuck, it's so good. You're so sexy. It's so much more than my fingers." He took pleasure in her groans as she felt his shaft stroking her g-spot and her cunt. "Mmmmmmmmmm, don't stop, fuck me. Oh yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
