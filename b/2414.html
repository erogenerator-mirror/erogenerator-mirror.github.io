Her thoughts were now centered more on the teacher's words than the idea of being with the teacher. It was hard to think, but she also wanted to know what it felt like to be with the teacher.</p> <p>She tried to think of nothing else, but her thoughts kept racing. It was not as though the teacher had made her anything. She had been told how the teacher taught the best things to women. She had believed that she would be better off than the woman that her friend had been when she had told her that the teacher told the best things to her.</p> <p>She had thought that women should experience pleasure when they were with a man and only when the teacher was in control. To do that was to experience it with a man; women do not. She was not sure that she did it on purpose, but she didn't have the desire to make it happen. She knew that she wouldn't go so far without knowing what the teacher did with her.</p> <p>Her thoughts kept going to the teacher's words, but she only saw the teacher's eyes, and then she focused on those eyes. The teacher had a look that was a mix of sadness and anger on her face. She could tell that her attitude had changed for a different reason than the old girl that she had always thought she had wanted.</p> <p>"I think that it is best if you do what your friend's boyfriend would do if he found out and told his girlfriend what she did tonight. If you were the man she wanted, you will want to do that, and your boyfriend will not think that you had a choice with a girl like her. Do you have any idea what she has always been like?" the teacher's question was directed to the teacher's eyes.</p> <p>She took a step toward her. She didn't know what she would do. She didn't know how to react. She didn't know who she was supposed to be with, or what was her name. She wanted to know if she liked it, knew what it felt like, if it was a turn on.</p> <p>The teacher saw her struggle and leaned up on her elbow. It would be a sin to force her to do that, to have a relationship with a person who was not interested in sex. She thought of herself as some kind of sexual object, a possession that she might be treated for money at a moment's notice. A thought occurred to her, the teacher was not interested in sex. She realized that she wanted to make some of that interest come in a way that she did not wish for it to come as some kind of punishment for herself.</p> <p>"No," she said. She looked at the teacher. "I don't want to do this." Then she looked at herself. She had never felt more exposed in her life. She could see that her clothes were wrinkled. She hated the thought that her skin was still tingly from the sun. She looked at the class and realized that she had never felt more exposed and vulnerable.</p> <p>"Don't do this," the teacher said. "Make yourself an example of yourself here, remember your choice?"</p> <p>Nodding she leaned forward a bit to give the teacher a kiss on the cheek. The teacher was surprised at first, but then she relaxed as her eyes wandered over the student's body. "I'll be back in a moment," she said.</p> <p>"I'll be back in a minute," she said as she rose and headed up the stairs.</p> <p>With her legs slightly wobbly she made her way into the kitchen to prepare dinner. She sat at the table, pulled a sandwich out of the fridge, and took a bite before she realized that the feeling returned.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The teacher left soon after, but she would be right back with her sandwich, so she quickly ate the sandwich. When she was done she took the sandwich and her trash out onto the front porch, and then headed to the back door and back yard. She needed to think about what she was going to do with that thought. It was obvious that she had made a decision to be with the teacher in a sexual way, but she didn't know what that would feel like to have sex with a woman.</p> <p>She was feeling very conflicted for some reason. Maybe with the idea of being with the teacher in a sexual way was not completely out of the question. It was also obvious that she would have to think about that when making a decision. She wasn't ready for that either.</p> <p>She had no idea what she would do if anything were aboutâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
