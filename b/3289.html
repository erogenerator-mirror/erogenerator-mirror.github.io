I've never seen that type of energy." I said, blushing.</p> <p>"Well, you'll have to go to a bigger class next year," said Brad. "This is the way our campus is...or not." he said.</p> <p>"Okay, thanks, but I'm going to do this tomorrow."</p> <p>"Uh-huh. I think we should get you here tomorrow. When it gets really dark, you can use the key I gave you." said Brad. "Maybe you'll find a better use for it."</p> <p>"That's probably a good idea." I said.</p> <p>"I got all kinds of great ideas, but..." Brad said, pulling me up by the hand. "I'm sure I'll have a wonderful future with you. So, if you want to stay, I'm sorry to say I'll definitely stay."</p> <p>I leaned up against him and smiled. Then I began unpacking the boxes in my arms.</p> <p>"I think this is a great place." I said, turning to look over the trees.</p> <p>"Yes, and I agree. I had a lot of fun last weekend, and I enjoyed it more than I could let down the rest of my family."</p> <p>That was true. They had lived there for about a decade. I hadn't seen them since we moved to this campus.</p> <p>"I can't believe we are moving to this place." I said, turning back to pull on a shirt that was already dry.</p> <p>"You aren't disappointed, are you?" he said, grinning at me.</p> <p>"I guess it is, but I'm not complaining."</p> <p>I grinned back at him.</p> <p>"You better look good to me when you move out, Rob." he said.</p> <p>I took his hand and raised it to my lips. He put his two fingers through my lips and then rubbed my bottom lip. Smiling, I put our hands on the shirt, pulling it up over us as we walked down to the dock.</p> <p>"Hey!" he said. "Don't you want to get out of it already?"</p> <p>"Not as much as you do." I joked, turning around. "Why don't you pick that towel up over here and we can get in the car?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you do great with that." he said, stepping forward. He pulled his shirt off and threw it aside, then went to his bags. I took off my shirt.</p> <p>"I don't see anyone in the cab, so come on." I said, grabbing him and pulling him into the cab. "I have to put a towel over your legs for the ride here." I said, pulling it off and dropping it into the back seat.</p> <p>The ride was fun. The guys in the back talked and joked with each other, and me and Brad talked about our favorite books. There were many, many questions that we never got an answer to, but we were all really having a good time.</p> <p>When we got to the resort, I opened the door, slipping in first.</p> <p>"Come on in." I said, leading Brad back inside.</p> <p>With him standing with his back to me, I walked around to the door. I pulled Brad into the hall and pulled the handle a bit, then stepped back. I opened the door and led him in. As we walked upstairs, I dropped our clothes on one of the guest beds.</p> <p>"We have a suite for the week!" Rob said, standing up.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's what I thought."</p> <p>"You like sharing, don't you?"</p> <p>"Sure." I said, pulling him into the bedroom. The front door closed and I stepped back with Brad.</p> <p>The room was small, barely big enough for the bed, but it would probably fit. I pulled Brad to me and wrapped my arms around him, kissing him as I did.</p> <p>"Let's go out in the pool," Brad said, leading me down the hallway, past the door, where there was a huge, white chaise lounge in the center.</p> <p>"Come up, let me change before we go in, I want to get a swim." I said, kissing him.</p> <p>Brad led me over to the chaise and sat down. I smiled and sat down as he undid the towel tie and slipped it off, then dropped the towel on the pool deck. "You know, I haven't done this in a long time." I said, stroking his legs.</p> <p>"Me either." Brad said. "But if you want to go in and make out at one of the pools, I'll be happy to go with you."</p> <p>I smiled, kissing his lips whileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
