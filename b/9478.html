"But I know I can't take too much more of that in this position," she says.</p> <p>"Don't worry. I will get in the best position, that's for sure. We can stop here at the end of the dance floor to cool off some before heading back to join your other friends."</p> <p>"Thanks, Dave."</p> <p>"My pleasure. I will see you after we leave."</p> <p>Karen goes to the bar and starts to get what she knows I like. When she returns with a couple of vodka tonic's she orders another one. We toast our good fortune and continue working on the dance floor.</p> <p>I can tell by the look on her face she is having a good time with a couple of the other guys and also the other couple we are dancing with. I notice another woman dancing at Mike's table with a guy. He is really enjoying himself and he is obviously enjoying it by dancing with her. Maybe he will get lucky tonight.</p> <p>Karen starts the dance with a couple of the guys and soon is dancing with another guy. I continue to be amazed.</p> <p>We move into the back of the club to a booth in the back of the corner where we start to get more risqué. The dancer is a redheaded girl who looks like she may be of Japanese descent or maybe Native American. She is in her forties and still has the body of a woman. She looks a bit like a younger woman. There is no doubt about that.</p> <p>She dances with a couple of the guys dancing. Most of them seem to be in their mid-thirties.</p> <p>The redhead moves a little farther away from the guy she is dancing with and starts to rub her body against him.</p> <p>There is a slight gasp from the guy she is dancing with. He moves back and places his hands on her waist. His hands move up her back and he starts to massage her naked tits. He moves one hand down to her pussy and starts to finger her. She moves her body back and they get tangled up again. I am sure that Karen would never do that. It's obvious she likes to feel a man's touch there. They both take their hand off her body and her friend moves closer.</p> <p>I have had a lot of voyeur stories and this is definitely one of those for me, but she is doing this for me. My cock is sticking out of my pants and Karen notices! She moves right in front of me and kneels in front of me and takes hold. I start to stroke her hair and look around to see who is there. I see a woman I recognize as the black woman who took Mike to another club. She is standing behind Mike.</p> <p>They are both naked and the two women are obviously kissing as they are swaying back and forth. They move their hips in perfect rhythm as the other woman dances close to them. Suddenly she steps away and turns to get beers from behind her friend.</p> <p>A look of shock and awe comes over her face as she sees I am stroking the big dick that I am sure is sticking out of my pants. A look of shock turns to excitement as she sees she is about to get a real handjob from a big man. She smiles at me as she pulls her friend away and starts to walk away.</p> <p>I get some drinks for Karen and myself before we turn the dance floor into another dance. This time I keep my hand over my crotch but still stroke her hair. We continue to dance and she starts to make a point to grind her pussy into me. Her hand starts to move under my top. Soon she is rubbing my rocker while I stroke her friend's chest.</p> <p>Another song comes on and it is just the two of us. They start to move in a more forceful rhythm. They are really moving back and forth as they sway. I wonder if this is going to be our last dance before she puts on a show for us.</p> <p>Suddenly the couple from the night before is getting out to the open area to dance. She has a very fine body.</p> <p>Their dance is almost over. They turn back and walk away. One of the girls says something to them in a French accent but doesn't seem to be saying the same thing to me. I guess Karen feels she has a chance. She does what Mike says that she does and she gets out of the booth and goes back to the other guy she was with.</p> <p>The guy gets out with the lady one too and walks away. She then pulls him in front and they dance the next dance.</p> <p>Karen has been having an incredible time, dancing with me, watching her friend and kissing me. She tells me to give her a "free tour". After that dance they both start to get back to their places with Mike and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
