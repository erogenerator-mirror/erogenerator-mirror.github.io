He's never had a blowjob in his life."</p> <p>Doris let go of my head and rolled off the bed. I scrambled to get up, but just as I got to the edge of the bed, I felt a hand on each thigh and a tongue licking slowly up from my knee to my ankle, then slowly back down one more time, starting near my knee and ending at the bottom of my foot.</p> <p>"Mmm..." she cooed, "You taste delicious, baby."</p> <p>Her tongue ran along my inner thigh, slowly toward her wet, hot mouth. I closed my eyes and tilted my head back, savoring the pleasure of her soft lips touching me. She kissed her way across my legs, dragging her tongue along one side of my knee and back over the other. When the underside of my foot came to rest between her lips, she licked back and forth and around one side of her mouth, then went to the other side until she was back at eye-level with my sex. She didn't just use saliva to moisten, she used her tongue, sliding it from top to bottom of my slit all the way up to my clit.</p> <p>My back arched, my breathing came short, and my knees began to tremble. I was going to cum - I knew it - and my hips were already pumping my aching sex into her face. She didn't stop and I felt fingers playing with my clit, and a tongue running up and down each side of my slit, then back down to my other opening. It was a shock as she moved back up, but I felt her tongue dart over my clit like it was a cock. As soon as my head came up, I opened my eyes and watched Doris as she moved into a kneeling position beside the bed, her head between my legs and her fingers playing with my opening. I felt her finger slide right inside me, then back out again.</p> <p>"I want you to cum," I murmured.</p> <p>"Mm, yesssss," she answered, "Yes, baby, yessssss!"</p> <p>Doris sucked my clitoris between her lips, nibbling the nub with her teeth. It didn't take long, and my body began to jerk in response. I was thrusting my hips, trying to gain more of her attention, but she just kept licking, her tongue still flicking across me from top to bottom.</p> <p>"Oh yessss," I cried out, "I'm about to cum, oh my fucking god! Oh, yessss!"</p> <p>And I was, there, on the very precipice of orgasm, the dam breaking under Doris' skillful tongue and fingers as my body began to shudder and shudder, and as my cum shot from me, I felt her finger slide out of me and my insides spasm in orgasm. Her tongue kept rubbing against me until I began coming down from my high, only to come back up again, and I felt her mouth at my opening again, just as I was coming back up from my high.</p> <p>"I love you," she whispered, then kissed me on the lips, her face against mine, her tongue sliding over mine.</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>"Shit," we heard Trisha yell up the stairs, and Doris' head flew back.</p> <p>Tori, a girl from the neighborhood, came downstairs and saw Trish and me both in the nude. Trisha looked embarrassed as she sat on the edge of the bed, and then saw her naked self in Doris' arms.</p> <p>"Holy fuck," Trish said. "You two were meant to be together."</p> <p>Doris and I looked at each other and laughed.</p> <p>"It was one thing to make love to your girlfriend on New Year's Eve," Doris said, "but it's another thing to be involved with two women without the usual stuff, right?"</p> <p>"What's wrong with being with two women? After all, it's a party, isn't it?"</p> <p>Doris reached out and smoothed her fingers over Trish's cheek. "You really need to tell us if you really want to go for it. At the same time, tell them that they're beautiful and that you really want us to be happy together."</p> <p>"What, do you have a secret you won't tell?" Doris asked.</p> <p>"Not a secret," Trish added.</p> <p>We sat there in silence for a moment, as Doris slid her hands all over Trish's breasts and legs. Trish was breathing hard and her nipples were very hard, so Doris kissed her neck then turned her around and kissed her, then turned her back to Doris and kissed her breasts and kissed herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
