She smiled at me as she climbed on the bed, slipping inside me in one smooth motion.</p> <p>"I love you," she whispered, as her hands caressed and played with my nipples. The sensation in the morning was so different from the previous night; I could feel more than just her fingers moving over me.</p> <p>"I love you, too," I whispered, but I didn't want to wake her up for another ten minutes!</p> <p>"Good!" she said. She started to move herself up and down my shaft, and I moaned my approval. "I love you, too!" Her own moans of pleasure added to her enjoyment, and for some reason, she moved a little faster, but kept her hand still, allowing me to enjoy what was coming.</p> <p>It was a long slow ride, but each one got better for both of us by the time we were done. Gail was more vocal than Anna was, and her own moans of pleasure were the loudest on record. "I love you, Gail. I love you." Her fingers worked to push her orgasm into me as I watched my lover moving herself with her mouth and my hands.</p> <p>In between moans, Gail asked me to move down toward her. I did, and she grabbed my cock and guided it into her waiting pussy. "I want to suck you, Jack," she said, giving me a brief kiss before moving the tip between her lips and down my shaft. "My husband likes it that way, too." I felt the tip of my cock slide open, and she moved it gently in and out of her and said, "Let me take care of you."</p> <p>I moaned as my cock slid into her and slid into her, but she wouldn't let me go, and her movements with her mouth felt wonderful between us. The two of us were in a sixty nine on top for a good long time, and that made it even better for both of us. She came harder than she did before I'd started, and I felt her juices run down my balls and into the hair on my pelvis. She held me with her arms while she finished her orgasm, and I started stroking in and out of her as she held my cock near the edge with her lips and hand and massaged my balls.</p> <p>The sensation in my cock was nothing short of amazing, and Gail told me as she felt me shoot inside her one last time, "That was great, Jack." She let me up, and stood up again. "You can help me with this if you like..." She spread her legs wide and I slid into her again. "If you're ever horny, you can use Jack, now, if you want to watch me doing this," she said, stroking my cheek as she moved to the bed again. She lay on her back, opening her legs and inviting me to fuck her. I entered her with one easy thrust and felt my cock sliding in and out of her pussy. Her hands were on my chest as she held me in. "It was just the way I wanted it..." She reached up with her arms, pulled her breasts away and looked directly at me, then reached down behind her and touched her clit. I started to move against her, feeling the heat of her body. We were both close to coming. "I want you to come, to come in me. Right now." She rubbed her clit harder, as she pushed her body closer. "I want you to come on my tits!" She arched her back and thrust her tits high in the air. "That's it!" Her pussy tightened around my cock as she gasped and moaned. "I'm coming!" She grabbed me tightly and moved on her back to catch the fullness as each wave subsided. Her body seemed to go still for a moment, then she lay back on the bed with her legs open, pulling me with them. I slipped out and got up to use the bathroom.</p> <p>Gail was still lying in bed, her legs open and her pussy red, and she smiled at me as I got back to the bedroom, getting behind her, getting my cock back in her pussy. I knelt in front of her, kissing her neck and down to her shoulders as I reached up to fondle her tits. Gail was still smiling as I went to work, my hands caressing her smooth, naked body. She was so warm under my hands that I really felt the heat inside her when my fingers started to make little circles around her stomach in circles, moving slowly. A couple of them went lower, across her pubic hair, and then I felt the smooth skin run between both breasts, moving lower onto her rib cage, and then back onto her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
