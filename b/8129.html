She was still wearing her panties and I went down on one knee and placed her ankle onto my shoulder and moved my face toward her pussy. Her outer lips were slightly opened and I could see wetness just beginning to seep out. They were so beautiful and I looked at the pink inner lips that were swelling with desire. I could hear her breathing quicken and she said, "Oh, fuck me."</p> <p>I lifted her legs up so I could place her feet at the top of my thighs. She was still quivering with passion, her legs stretched out at the edge of the tub to accommodate the weight of my upper body and her legs came up to encase my torso. My cock throbbed in response to her eroticism and I positioned myself on my knees between her legs, placing my glans on her vaginal opening. She could feel the warmth of me as I pressed forward and her legs lifted to give me full access.</p> <p>"Oh yes, darling, fuck me." she said.</p> <p>When I felt her body relax, I moved my penis back and forth along her vaginal opening. She responded with her hips moving up and down to enhance the feeling as I slowly entered her. I felt her vagina contract. My penis continued to penetrate her. She could feel my pubic hair as it rubbed up against her bottom. She continued to breathe through the head of my dick and when I finally felt my pubic hair brushing against her lower lips, I pushed forward causing her to gasp again.</p> <p>"Oh Yes, that's good." she said.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Darling it's been so long."</p> <p>When I felt her body relax and I felt the warmth of her wetness, I knew I was going to shoot hot semen into her. I stopped. I felt my penis twitch. I could sense her tension diminish as we waited for our orgasm to take control of her. It didn't take long. I was ready to make love to her but the feeling of her vagina around my penis kept me from doing so and I was able to keep going.</p> <p>"Yes, Baby, yes, please, fuck me." she said.</p> <p>This time that I entered her with a sudden and forceful thrust I was completely engulfed in her wet warmth. I felt her contract. She had been anticipating the feeling of me deep inside her and the heat of my come that had been filling her for several minutes.</p> <p>We both moaned deeply. Our breathing came in rhythm and our grunts made perfect harmony with our mutual satisfaction.</p> <p>She turned to face me. She placed her arms around my neck. We kissed with abandon. Her breasts were soft against my chest and she had a look of joy on her face. We broke the kiss and our breaths became shorter. I knew right then that our orgasm had come one which had gone on way too long and was still going.</p> <p>She whispered, "It was wonderful, Darling. Wonderful... wonderful... just wonderful and unbelievable, but it's going to get much better from here."</p> <p>"I want you inside me again."</p> <p>"And maybe we both want the same thing."</p> <p>"Just as long as I'm with you."</p> <p>"Oh, so soon, and I want you, too."</p> <p>"And that's what I was hoping, Honey."</p> <p>"Oh my God, I can't wait until you feel the fullness that's coming again."</p> <p>"That's what I hoped, Darling."</p> <p>That was another story we won't be telling when the next installment comes. This is not a relationship and I won't discuss sex with other guys, but that's what they are doing and it is a fantasy. It seems that I have created a sexual character from another man.</p> <p>I wish you enjoyed this story as much as I enjoyed writing it.
