But as I pulled on my pants, she said:</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind if I take care of the car ... it will be easier that way ... I'm not going anywhere right now ..."</p> <p>I smiled.</p> <p>"Don't worry. And we won't need much anymore. I think you can drive it ..."</p> <p>After we got home, I asked her to take the Jeep and I drove it to the mall - I had a new new Lexus. She asked me to tell her about my car. I told her to make herself comfortable ... she was sitting in the living room watching tv. I knew she was still feeling weird about last night ... but it was the best sex I've ever had. And that's what she felt. Now it felt so right too. All this time she felt that she didn't have it ... she was just afraid, that all those things would be the same ... but they didn't ... it feels too good ... she just wanted that much more and that she liked them ...</p> <p>So I went into the bedroom and started looking for her. As I came out with her, she looked me in the eyes. She was still dressed, but she had on a robe. It looked beautiful.</p> <p>"Well ... if you can get me something from the kitchen," she said, "There's some left over stuff for breakfast."</p> <p>I got up and went into the kitchen and started to prepare whatever I could - I knew how to reheat food, because they came with the cooking gear from Europe and the refrigerator and all the rest.</p> <p>I got the tub of water from the cabinet and sat down, putting in the water from a sauna-like setting - I had just done that yesterday ... and with a drink of the water, I started to wash the hair around it again.</p> <p>"That's good ... you did that for me last night ..." she said. But then she said:</p> <p>"And if all went well, you will have more hair, ... even in the middle ... you know - in fact, the hair that grows on me will be more natural anyway."</p> <p>I took the shampoo, got that and looked at her again. I couldn't believe the total transformation. She was still dressed, but more beautiful in that dress than she was last night. She was still beautiful! Her shoulders were almost back, her hair hung almost all the way down to her lower back but was long and silky smooth and there was something about it that caught my eyes and made me think how much she looked really sexy.</p> <p>She put the shampoo down; she looked at me with her eyes wide and she saw me looking at her.</p> <p>"I guess we should get your hair ... I didn't mean to embarrass you ..." And she looked me right in the eye and leaned closer to kiss me ... I kissed her back. After a few seconds, she stepped back.</p> <p>"I'm not ready to sleep right now ... it's been a long day, ..." she said.</p> <p>I didn't bother to reply; I kept on washing her hair, just standing in the tub with my back to her. As we came down from our mutual kiss, she said: "Honey ... I think I want to do this some other time. Please don't get upset if you don't feel comfortable ... I won't." Then she said:</p> <p>"But right now, we need to get some work done ... if not that before we go shopping ... if you don't think you will mind?"</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"I'm ... not sure ..." she said. "It's more of a feeling now ... not in school, ... but at home ..."</p> <p>And she continued:</p> <p>"I still like your hair ... it's really beautiful, and I really like it ... but now it's time to get to work, ... I want you to do this a lot."</p> <p>"If you do ... I don't mind ..."</p> <p>She just nodded and we started going back to the work - but when I came out with her, she looked at me again. I started out with a glass of water - just water, but she went ahead with some coffee and we started making some sort of omelet ... and when I finished that, I put my hands up her robe and took it off of her ... and we got down to work.</p> <p>She was still wearing nothing but one of the robes - her hands were on her knees ... I said:</p> <p>"This time, we should go in the clothes-store, I think there will be some other clothes to show you as well ..."</p> <p>She looked at me and asked:</p> <p>"Well ... what should I buy?"</p> <p>"You can choose to wear aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
