She moved one hand up to my breast and then back down between us as she cupped my sex and brought her fingers to my clit. She started to stroke me and I shuddered as she teased my clit, then she moved one hand up to continue stroking my lips and the first three fingers, then she circled my clit again, and again, and she teased it with the tip of her little finger. I was surprised by how quickly she could bring me to that threshold of excitement. She sensed it, and kept going to tease me. My breath coming in short gasps.</p> <p>Then she turned her attention to the head of my pussy and she used her finger to tease my clit, and the fingers stroking my clit, and the fingers teasing my clit, and soon she was making my whole body tingle. Then my body tensed, then relaxed, then I almost fainted as I came with such a force and intensity my breath left me in little whimpers. "My darling, I know what the orgasm feels like, but the moment it comes, I have to feel your body on mine," she whispered. "I'm going to do everything I can to make you happy." Her hand still stroking me, her fingers still pressing along, bringing me to the edge again - then backing off, as if to tease again. It was too much, and my breathing was ragged and shallow, yet she continued to caress my clit while she teased me and I felt like I would erupt.</p> <p>She moved her hand away, and she lay beside me and, as if it had been on its way to us, she rolled onto her side and cuddled up to me. She put her head on my right shoulder, and she snuggled close to me as we lay panting and spent. "What time is it?" I asked, "what would you like?"</p> <p>She turned to look at me and then leaned against me, "The alarm clock's still on in the back seat." She whispered, and we turned our heads toward each other and kissed. "Would you like to go to bed?"</p> <p>After a bit, I replied, "I'm exhausted and you are making it feel like home." That comment wasn't so unexpected. Still, it was the last thing that I wanted to do, that I knew I had asked, and I smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, "but we can be quick if you really want to take the train."</p> <p>We got up and showered and then put on our clothes and went to bed. Just before falling asleep, I got up to get some more wine and to make love again. Then I was asleep.</p> <p>It was a short sleep with only minor dreams. At the airport, I got dressed and went directly to the reception desk where the security officer was. "Thank you, sir. I'm afraid my husband is still on the line. He doesn't have his phone in him now."</p> <p>"Don't worry, sir, he doesn't have one. Just make sure the man I'm expecting to call on our flight." The security officer assured me it was just a quick check in with the security officer, and the man was happy to see me.</p> <p>I sat on a bench with the security guard as we waited for the plane to take off. As I said, my husband told us about his encounter with the security guard. Apparently, he had a girlfriend too - he'd told me what happened while we were waiting for the plane and I told him about the blow job he'd given the security girl and the hand job she gave.</p> <p>"Well, did she give him a 'fuck' as well as a 'fuck'? That makes a lot of difference. Did she fuck him? Did he cum when he gave a blow job? Or does it bother you?"</p> <p>"I would think. He is very attentive to your wife and to him as well."</p> <p>The guard gave me his report on why I should be concerned, but I found it hard to see that he had the same thing in mind when it came to his wife.</p> <p>"Mr. Hines? Mr. Williams? Are you on the plane? Is it ok with you if I join you. I know your wife is tired and so is she. And if you think it would bother me, then I have nothing to fear. Just stay out of her way and make sure he stays in line. In fact, I hope he does for you." As he said that, he put his arm around my waist and brought his lips close to my ear and asked "If I could give you a hand while you were awayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
