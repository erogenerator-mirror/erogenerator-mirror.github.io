Now, as he watched her from the foot of the bed, her bare feet made tiny and sexy little mounds. She stood there in those heels and the stockings, her fingers lightly stroking over the tops of her breasts as they stood erect. Finally, as he lay back on the bed, she reached for his cock. She felt him hardening even more inside his boxers as she slid her hand along its length, back and forth, all the way to the bottom. She could feel the length of him, as she stroked him softly for just a moment, before she moved on.</p> <p>This time, she went to a place that the young guy from across the bed stood, his hands at his sides. "Are you a good little boy?" she whispered. "Is daddy good little boy?"</p> <p>The guy leaned against the head board, his cock sticking straight up. She stood there, stroking slowly and teasingly. Her hand slipped down to his hairy chest, feeling down to his belly and gently stroking up and down, to his cock, which was fully hard and throbbing with his heartbeat. She was so near to it, as his hands came over hers and together they caressed it, his hand sliding gently on her bare forearm, while she stroked it in the meantime. His touch was firm and gentle and she could feel herself growing wet, especially around her panties and through the lace.</p> <p>She stood up, kneeling on the edge of the bed, the heels of her shoes digging into the backs of his calves. His hands came up to her and she brought her hands around his face, kissing him, his tongue sliding quickly into her mouth, as his hands moved to her small breasts, his fingers lightly squeezing her nipples through her bra.</p> <p>His hands slid down her back and then moved around to her ass, as he squeezed her buttocks and pulled at her cheeks. The material of her panties felt cool against his face as he slid his fingers into it, feeling her cheeks. It made her tremble and as he pulled her cheeks apart, his breath on her skin made her shiver. He bent and kissed back against her, his mouth pressing hard on hers.</p> <p>His body was so hard and so hot as his cock slid against her. His tongue moved out and lashing out, sliding over hers, as she felt his body heat on hers. She broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Baby..." her voice was shaky.</p> <p>The man's smile was a little harsh, and she had an idea. "Yes, baby?" he whispered in response to her. His voice was gentle now, almost to her ear, as his hands slid along her ass and across her thighs, rubbing her through the thin material of her panties. She opened her eyes wide, and watched him in the mirror as his hands moved to her, the hair on his cock tickling against one side of her crotch. His body was hard and his cock throbbed as his fingers felt her skin through the cloth. He ran his hands all over her ass and thighs, feeling the shape of a woman as smooth and perfect as his wife. She slid her own panties off and stepped out of them, letting them drop to the floor. She felt his hands on her ankles, guiding them higher so that she was kneeling more upright.</p> <p>"Mmm," she whispered, as the man lifted her by both ankles and laid her on the bed. He moved to her left and he took off her shoe, and slid it off her left foot, then slid it off her foot. His hands worked up her calves and up her thighs, to her thighs as he leaned down to kiss her again. The feel of him kissing and licking her as he rubbed his body against hers made her quiver so much and the softness of his body against hers. Her legs opened instinctively, offering him more access for him to stroke along the front of her panties, as she moaned into his mouth. She could feel his cock, as it slid up along her leg, as her own juices wet the material of his boxers. She could tell from the size and shape of him it was hard and swollen, just the way he liked it.</p> <p>He pulled back then. "Are you okay?" he asked. "Do you want this, for a little bit, honey?" he whispered softly.</p> <p>She nodded. "Yes, ohmigod yes, I want this more than I've ever wanted anything."</p> <p>He leaned down again, his lips caressing her again, as he unzipped her panties and slid them down her long and toned legs and off them, leaving her wearing only her shoes. She was completely naked apart from the little panties covering her, as he stood up and sat on the bed. He lay on his side next to her, his arm around her, and she felt his hand on one ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
