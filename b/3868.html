"You like sluts don't you?" She asked in a teasing tone as she licked her lips. Looking around.</p> <p>The parking lot was quite. Most of the guys at Jamboree were already there but there were those who just got out of the line. They didn't care what she looked like with those jeans she wore; she was the prettiest girl in town.</p> <p>"Here is your chance," she said holding up a set of keys and putting them inside her black designer purse. "Come on."</p> <p>We walked to the lot and I took a deep breath as we started to walk to Jamboree's. I could just imagine myself standing there. Here was the perfect opportunity and I knew there was no turning back.</p> <p>I walked the few blocks and when I got to Jamboree's it was quiet. Just a few guys sitting at the bar were talking to each other. I wondered if I should really bother, but it was too late now.</p> <p>I walked up to the door after looking around to see if anyone could help me. I waited for about ten seconds. Then one of the guys at the bar asked me if I could buy her a drink.</p> <p>I walked up and she waved and turned to say something. Then the bartender came over. He smiled as I put the glass on the bar. "Just a double to get her another double," he said smiling. He handed me a single malt, something I had never tasted before.</p> <p>Just then the lights in the parking lot came up. I saw two cars in the lot. I stepped back and then walked back toward Jamboree to tell her I would buy her a drink.</p> <p>We went to the bar and he poured her a double. When she sipped her drink she sat the glass down on the bar with her eyes still staring at the door. "Thanks," she said.</p> <p>He asked for a beer and she put one in her purse. "I'm going to watch the road, guys," she said.</p> <p>"You'll be safe here, you know," he told her, with a wink.</p> <p>Jamboree had the keys in her hand and she took them from her purse. The guys at the bar took a closer look at her and she handed them to them. I watched as they took their glasses, they were about two feet to the left of me where my head was.</p> <p>"Here, hold these," Jamboree said as she handed me her keys. They were the keys to my car and then she took a set of keys in her purse. "Now, lets see about getting into the car," she said, holding up the keys.</p> <p>They both took the keys and I followed her around a few cars and then through a metal gate to a house. "Ok," she said, again holding up my key. "We'll be waiting outside for you." I watched as they opened the house and then the gate that led off onto the street.</p> <p>The front door had a little door leading off into the forest; a wooden fence over it was at least eighteen inches high and about three feet wide. There were a few light stands on one side of the yard in an orderly fashion and the front door was the same as that in the driveway, but now the light stood.</p> <p>Jamboree walked around holding up a set of keys, a couple keys. "Here, let me open that door." She said as she opened the door to the porch. "Come, I'll take you inside." And in a few moments I saw the lights in the kitchen going on as she led me by the arm across the kitchen and through a set of wide wooden doors into the kitchen area. We walked into what looked like a home office, there a large sofa, a coffee table and a desk with some shelves behind a counter.</p> <p>All the tables were full and there were four chairs and a round table. The center of the couch faced the coffee section. As we walked through the kitchen a second door that went in back held an adjoining toilet by its own power line from the ceiling. There was a sink with the sinks in it. The front of the bathroom had a toilet inside and the door to the bathtub was at least five inches open.</p> <p>Jamboree was standing by the sink holding the keys. "Take them, come on. It's time for your drink." She said waving them through the open door.</p> <p>I looked at her as she picked back a couple of keys with my keys. She held her hand out toward me.</p> <p>"No," she said, indicating my arm.</p> <p>"Here," she said, as I took the keys from her and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
