She teased.</p> <p>I smiled and headed to the end of the bed. She leaned back as I kissed the corner of her lips. My mouth continued my journey toward hers, gently nibbling along the inside edge. When I reached her waist I was pleased to feel her shivering as she felt my lips near.</p> <p>As they met, we shared the kiss. I slowly worked toward the center of her body as the soft caress of my fingers danced across her stomach, over her breasts and down her belly to her sweet place. I loved every second that my mouth danced over her sweet lips, the warmth as I kissed her made me want to taste her sweet juice. When I reached the base of her navel I paused. Her hands came up to meet my mouth. We embraced together with just the two of them.</p> <p>I felt her hand reach for the back of my head, pulling me closer to her. When our lips came together I felt a rush of electricity flow through me. Our mouths melted together with the touch of their tongues and the soft stroking of mine. I was in heaven.</p> <p>I broke the embrace. As I stood up my hands were suddenly covered in liquid heat. I watched her breasts shake with each of them. With outstretched arms I took control, bringing her down to the bed as I gently caressed her legs. She gasped at the pleasure I was causing her and wrapped her legs around me, pulling me close to her. The bed dipped in and out from the movements of our bodies. She moaned in pleasure as she lifted her hips upward. I felt her hand reach back as if to guide me to enter her. But I hesitated a moment more. I smiled as I lowered my mouth from her neck to her breasts.</p> <p>I kissed my way down her belly and felt her hands pulling me up. She wanted me. She wanted my mouth on her.</p> <p>After making my way to her inner thighs I began the journey down her body. I licked her right through her panties and stopped to allow her body to open just a little. When I raised my body and sat down again I allowed her body to slide down. She groaned at this loss as I ran my lips back up her flat belly. When I raised my head she looked down to see my mouth hovering over her panties. I kissed her belly button and began to slide my hands up to her hips just above the waistband of her panties.</p> <p>"No, just suck them!" She demanded.</p> <p>I looked at her briefly and saw a grin on her face. Then I went to work on her panties, gently kissing each pair. I saw her hips raise when I ran my tongue from the bottom of her panties to the top at the top of her thighs. I made my way up the left side of her smooth skin and licked the little strip where her skin met her panties. When I kissed there I could feel her shiver again.</p> <p>Her hand took the back of my hair and tugged my head up as she began to grind her sex against my face. I wanted to take the time to explore but I had to kiss her first.</p> <p>As I began to kiss her lips, she brought her hand to my face. "Lick them, honey! Lick my lips! I want to feel you lick my lips" she moaned as she felt my tongue flicking across her lips.</p> <p>My tongue darted into her mouth as soon as she opened it. I had never tasted a woman before, though I had heard some of the videos it would be fun to try. But the taste was divine! It was the very essence of a woman's essence. I felt her hands pull me up tightly to her face. When she met my mouth again she pulled me closer and pressed her sex hard against me.</p> <p>It was like her hand was holding me in check. When we made contact I felt as if I had just come out of nowhere.</p> <p>My tongue made an exploratory journey into her mouth. With out touching her, I felt my tongue caressing her. Her tongue moved closer to capture me. It was like a caress that was almost impervious to the warmth of her body. The only response I got was a moan. While my tongue was working on her, my hands traveled higher and slid beneath her to feel her soft breasts.</p> <p>My thumb and fingers kneaded them as I continued the assault on her lips. Her tongue was alive and moving with my mouth. She began to groan and was moving her hips slowly, dragging them over my tongue.</p> <p>When my hands reached her bare skin, I cupped her hands and squeezed. She moaned again.</p> <p>"I want you." She begged.</p> <p>My thumbs slid into the soft flesh of her hips and rolled them back and forth against myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
