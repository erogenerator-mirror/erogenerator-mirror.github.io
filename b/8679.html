What she hadn't told me was that she used a special oil with no other company, with a slight sheen to it that made up a film of sweat and semen on her body, and she had just sucked my prick off and swallowed every drop, all the while keeping her eyes locked onto mine (or rather looking directly down, into my eyes) as she gave me the most intimate blowjob of my life, and she had been drinking it. I'd come three times already in her mouth, and she kept swallowing every drop of cum; I don't think that in real life would've felt better, but with the alcohol I still believed that she didn't want to do it again. We had made love a few times but she never swallowed my dick. When she finally broke the kiss, she looked up at me with her lips parted and smiled. That smile had been for years, but it had disappeared long before. In one of the things about her I'd discovered about her that she seemed to have been a real person, and that I couldn't help believe it. Claire, after all, had taken the time to learn what we could and couldn't do together. I thought of her naked body, which I often admired and admired. I found myself fantasizing about it and it seemed to be a big turn on.</p> <p>Claire looked back into my eyes, which looked at her for a moment, and nodded her head.</p> <p>"It's okay, Jack. You've fucked many women, and I love it. It's been too long and there are so many women out there who'd give anything to have you."</p> <p>She paused, and I smiled at her. My thoughts flashed back to her naked body, which I imagined making up the bedsprings, and wondering how it would feel to have her come in the house wearing only her panties, with her legs spread wide apart and the cheeks of her full bottom exposed, giving herself to me, to the world, to the world of other women, for me to fuck. But I knew that I wanted it too, but that would never be part of our relationship.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said and kissed her. "I'll give you until Friday to leave my house, and then I won't be able to fuck you again."</p> <p>Claire hugged me and I kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>"I really think you're a nice guy. You've been very generous with me, and all around the place. I don't know what I want. I guess I'd like to stay here until I can get back a lot, to keep in touch, and I'm glad that you are open-minded like I am and I don't have to spend my life living here anymore."</p> <p>I wasn't sure that Claire would take me for a fool. I could have been a real, if shallow, guy but I'd gotten what I needed, so there would be no real harm in asking her for something along those lines.</p> <p>"How about you?"</p> <p>"I suppose. I have to go home to get a job. Should be awhile. But I hope I can stay open for you."</p> <p>I'm not sure what she was thinking, but then I guess that it wasn't all about me getting her back. Or maybe she thought that if I fucked her she wouldn't have to go back to the one where she had to be faithful to her husband. It was certainly something that I didn't share with her, but I couldn't think of her as a saint.</p> <p>Claire had said that her friend Angela was a good lay. I didn't care for that and I didn't see any reason to doubt her. Claire had been very kind to her friend and she had done all she could for her friend, and I would have loved to have fucked her. But I also had a feeling that Claire would be able to use her friendship to help me with mine. And she had been there for a number of days. What was going on?</p> <p>I felt that it was time to get up and leave, but I had one more thought. This wasn't about me making love with Claire, but about me coming to the one place where I was sure that it would be okay. I needed somebody special in my life. Someone I could trust and didn't need.</p> <p>"I had a really nice night," I said. "Would you like to come back to my apartment before you go back home to college?"</p> <p>"I'd really like that," said Claire, then she paused and looked at me for a long moment. "Do you want your apartment on campus or would you like to come back here as soon as we can find something to do?"</p> <p>I really hadn't been serious about having a job or living with her yet, but I also had some serious doubtsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
