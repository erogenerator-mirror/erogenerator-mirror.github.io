"I can always change my mind."</p> <p>"So you are going to get what you want?" I said. "You're only going to go with what's happened here."</p> <p>"Well, I guess I'm a little nervous because I wanted to say something about it, but it was really just that... It was so sudden, and I'm really afraid you are going to think I'm weird."</p> <p>"I've never expected to think that way about anybody, I've just always thought you guys were great." I said. I put my hands on her shoulders and rubbed them gently. "Now if we just talk for a while, I'm sure you can find it all kind of interesting, and I'm sure we can come to some kind of agreement on how to handle things if we really really don't want to," I said. She smiled at that, and leaned back against me, resting her head on my shoulder with her arm over me. I think we both fell asleep in seconds.</p> <p>After a lot more kissing and a lot more touching each other, which were both very pleasant to do, it was time to go back to our room so to speak. So we did, and I took her to the bed, and we kissed again for a while before I slid out of bed. I pulled the covers back and undressed myself. She looked up at me and smiled. "Okay," she said. "I'm game for anything." She ran her hands down over my body. My penis had quickly become somewhat hard in anticipation of her touch. I pulled the covers back with them, and she went back to her bedroom.</p> <p>"Are you hard yet?" I asked, trying to keep up.</p> <p>"I don't want to come," she said. "After what I just saw... What happens then?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I just, I don't have any other idea. I just want to see what happens," I said. "And I can see how I wouldn't worry if you were just a little bit scared or afraid. But..."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm okay," she said. She grabbed my penis and moved it to her mouth. She stuck her tongue out and touched the head of my penis all over the head of my penis with her tongue.</p> <p>"I'll be gentle," I said. She pulled back a little bit, and I saw a glimmer of some liquid just where my penis had been, but it was gone. She pushed further in, and my penis was wet with her saliva. She took it all in, and held it against her throat and then looked up at me.</p> <p>"I thought we agreed to talk about everything. Now that I think about it..."</p> <p>"I hope so too," she said. "This isn't your first time. Maybe it is, I don't know. I think maybe we have just made an agreement."</p> <p>"I think we have," I agreed. I looked down at her and smiled. "I'm all yours right now."</p> <p>I moved my lower body under hers, and she followed me, and we got up. "Let's go to my bed," she said. We got our shoes off first, and I pulled her up against me, and I kissed her passionately. We kissed deeply for a little while, and then I helped her to her bed.</p> <p>"It's only going to get better," I whispered to her as I slid away from her. "I don't know how much longer I'll be able to tell you the truth."</p> <p>"I know," she said. "You have no secrets from me," she said. "I love you very much."</p> <p>"I love you too," I told her as I held her tightly and kissed her neck. I ran my hands up and down her back and cupped her bottom, running my fingers over her cheeks and then slipping down to her shoulders. I put my arm around her waist, and we continued kissing, and her hand rubbed over my penis, and it returned her touch.</p> <p>"I can't wait anymore," she said.</p> <p>"I can't, either," I said. "I can't believe you would be willing to talk about this, after what happened." She was a little hurt that I had only gotten to this point, and I could have continued to talk, but I was afraid for her.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said. "I'll tell you what happened, and you can have at it."</p> <p>"Okay," I said.</p> <p>"That isn't a problem," she said. "We won't be doing anything that you don't want to, and I won't be trying to fight it anymore."</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed, and we kissed some more as our hands explored each other.
