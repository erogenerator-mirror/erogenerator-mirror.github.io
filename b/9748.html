And there it was, her son. They stood together at the door.</p> <p>"Come on, let's go." Josh said. He kissed her cheek and turned and took her by the hand to get her to the door. He closed the door behind them.</p> <p>Chapter 5 - The Awakening</p> <p>Dale was so relieved...he had hoped they could do this...but he didn't know exactly where he wanted to go. He had hoped maybe it was going to take him back to his parent's house...but there she was he thought...she was his sister.</p> <p>"Josh." He spoke softly, his heart beating like crazy.</p> <p>"Come on...let's go to bed." He said pulling her to him and making her sit. She looked up shyly toward him.</p> <p>"But...I thought you enjoyed it last night...I...I mean you...you did say you loved me, a lot, so I..." She stumbled. He put his finger to his lips and pulled her down over his lap.</p> <p>"I am still not sure how you feel about me...about us." He said softly. Taking her from his lap he ran his hands over her.</p> <p>He sat in his chair and felt her shaking when she felt how hard his pants were and what his cock actually like.</p> <p>"So do you want me inside you?</p> <p>She did not answer the question he asked. He took her hand and held it with one of his as he guided her head between the spread legs that were spread open. He spread her pussy and pushed her legs back to his chest...her hands were still holding his. "Come on, just make me feel good, please, Baby."</p> <p>She wanted this so bad but could not say no. She felt her face flush at the thought of what she was about to do.</p> <p>Josh took up a position between her legs and started massaging her pussy with his finger as he leaned over her.</p> <p>"What are you thinking about, honey?" Josh asked as he started to spread her lips.</p> <p>"Just going to take you hard again." She told him as she felt him pull away.</p> <p>"No...I want you inside of me. Are you sure? Do you want me to cum hard again?"</p> <p>He saw her eyes go wide and nodded vigorously, his face was so close when she was being turned over.</p> <p>"I want to hear you...like this...tell me...tell me what you thought. Now I want to hear it." Josh said as he looked down at her. He rubbed his thumb against the hardening clitoris as he watched her eyes.</p> <p>Dale looked up at him and nodded her head. "I am sure about that!"</p> <p>He kissed her gently on the lips, holding her mouth open as he slowly pushed her legs back into the bed as he positioned himself between her open legs with his hard wet cock as his eyes took in the way she felt underneath her face...her lips swelling up with her need for him as he held himself in front of her so he could see her eyes...just looking down as she saw just how much he wanted her.</p> <p>"Now, slide yourself down between us." He instructed. She didn't even hesitate. She was there. She wanted it so bad...all those years.</p> <p>As Dale pushed her, her legs fell back as they met the bed. She felt him lower himself and she was sure he could see and even feel it through her. This was so hot she thought.</p> <p>His cock was on her pussy, his ass right in her thighs. All of one second he stopped, and looking down, the look in his eyes was so intense, yet so much like her own. This had gone further than she ever wanted, yet she couldn't stop herself from letting it all out. All of that yearning and need, that was all she was letting it from her body. She wanted to be in his arms, to be his wife...She wanted to be his lover and to finally feel him in her and make love to him....</p> <p>"Do you want me, Mom." He asked. Her eyes were watering, the words flowing out of her mouth like crazy. Tears rolled down her face and splashed on the bed below her.</p> <p>"Yes." She whispered. "Now please fuck me, Josh." She begged.</p> <p>He lifted himself over her and positioned himself between her legs. Her legs were at the bottom of her bed and looked like it was made of thick rose petals. This way he could look down at her. She was just so fucking beautiful.
