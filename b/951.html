I made my way to the parking lot just before noon. I grabbed my bag and hurried to my car, leaving it a minute before I arrived at the mall. I felt like I needed to catch up, maybe I could even pick up a friend...</p> <p>The sun was high above the sky earlier, so the walk was a short one, and I decided to stop for a coffee. The parking lot was deserted, with cars already parked everywhere. I was pretty sure I was going to find a parking lot that wasn't filled with teenagers. My eyes were still in a daze when I realized that I didn't know which spot to park, so I was starting to feel a bit guilty.</p> <p>"Sorry..." my deep voice sounded. It wasn't that I regretted it... rather, I was starting to think it was worth it...</p> <p>I looked out the window and saw a young couple already inside the store. It looked like that was the place he worked at, and I was wondering if what I had seen a minute or so back was the true truth.</p> <p>"Is it still empty?" I asked, as I pulled out of the parking lot.</p> <p>He nodded his head.</p> <p>I got out of the car and headed towards the register. My fingers trembling with excitement I grabbed my purse and went to the register. I looked at the man as I left the parking lot, smiling.</p> <p>"Hi I'm Amanda...I got to run...." I said as I left the counter. I felt a little embarrassed, but it was kind of exciting to be out in public with a woman I was about to fuck. I started to pace around the store, a look of fear creeping into my countenance. In a split second, someone came up to me, and I just about fell over a coffee cart. The next thing I knew, I was in my car and speeding towards this part of town I had longingly wanted to get out of.</p> <p>"Amber...are you okay?" I heard a voice from outside as I pulled up to my stop.</p> <p>"Yes..." I responded as I sat down on the stool at the other end. I looked at the woman next to me, a woman I had met only once, but I'd never been able to get to know her, and I was having the hardest time feeling comfortable with myself as it was.</p> <p>"I'll give you a ride back." Her voice said as she gave me a brief hug. It felt so strange to have such a woman in my life, and she pulled me closer to her, her words soothing and comforting.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I am." I whispered, smiling like an idiot.</p> <p>My smile turned to disbelief at the fact that I was making some woman feel happy like I had never felt before.</p> <p>"I mean you shouldn't have, you know, left me alone like this!" She asked, looking surprised and embarrassed.</p> <p>I just stared at her and felt myself blush at the same time.</p> <p>"You know, I'm sorry for making you feel that way, I shouldn't have." I said as I put my right hand on the left side of my chest. I felt the warm feeling in my hand as I ran my hand over the blouse, feeling the soft material of the fabric. "Just let me take you home..." Her eyes were burning into mine as she leaned forward and gave me a hug. I could smell the scent of our desire in the other woman's touch.</p> <p>"No I don't...it's okay..." A voice said in my ear. I turned my head to see a girl in her 40's running up to me from the back. She was about my age, but not so much I thought. She was wearing a white blouse that fell open all the way to her midriff.</p> <p>"What are you doing here?" I asked, taking her right hand in mine. We just stood for a moment.</p> <p>"I needed you." She said, sliding her right hand over and around my neck, pulling me towards her for a deeper kiss. I could feel the heat of her body against mine as her hand pulled at my collar. Her voice was soft, her voice soft, and sensual.</p> <p>"You're not the only one that feels the warmth of another woman's body." I heard the woman behind me say as I leaned on my elbow, pulling me closer to her. I felt her tongue slowly licking up my neck, before it slid over my ear. I felt a slight breeze on the bare skin of my neck, causing my skin to shiver, causing my already hard nipples to tighten. I felt her hips press against me from behind and she rubbed herself against me in a way Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
