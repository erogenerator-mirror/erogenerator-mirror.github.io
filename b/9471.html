When I put my tongue inside her mouth she moaned her approval.</p> <p>I moved down to her breasts and started at her nipples. I began teasing her with my tongue and sucked and nibbled her breasts. I moved to where the lips formed a suction circle so I could go from one to the other. Julie arched her back and pushed herself deeper into my hand so I knew she was wanting more.</p> <p>She was making me very impatient. If I wanted to keep this for as long as I had, I had to wait for a bit.</p> <p>She began making a few little cooing sounds with each of our kisses. I slid down to where my tongue was making its little trail between her legs. My first taste was of what must have been a very light sweet-tasting cocktail of her sweetness. I made the lick her pussy with my tongue while I was still sucking on her breasts.</p> <p>I could feel the urgency of her need. I knew she was about to come as I slipped a finger into her pussy. Her lips were wet and slippery. I could feel her hot breath on my tongue as I kissed her face and lips. One of her hands was on my cock and the fingers went immediately to my balls. She felt the hardness and weight of my cock as she held me in her hand and slowly moved it back and forth while she pressed herself against the hand that was pumping my cock.</p> <p>"Yessss, please fuck me with your fingers, Jack, please!" She begged.</p> <p>At last I slid two fingers into her pussy and pressed them further up into her hot box. She was so hot and so tight that she knew that I had almost gone into her.</p> <p>She moved her left hand to my shoulder. She pulled herself against me and then pressed herself down so that my cock was against the softness of her lips. She began working her way around my cock until she was taking me deep in her throat. She pulled back off my cock just enough to put a glob of my precum on her tongue. There was just a fair amount of my creamy juice at her lips so she put her lips around it and licked it off of my cock and let me slide back in her throat.</p> <p>Julie was a natural. She was taking me deep, and she knew exactly how to do this. I was going wild. I had never been fucked like this before and I couldn't hold back too much longer.</p> <p>"Yesssss, I'm so close, I need to come, please." I was panting now and she looked up at me with that mischievous grin of hers.</p> <p>"Please? Please come in my mouth, Jack. I need it."</p> <p>This got me off. There was this urgency in her voice that was just out of this world.</p> <p>"Oh God, I'm so close, I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!"</p> <p>Julie pulled me forward and I felt her tongue flail against my balls as I emptied my seed into her mouth. She licked and sucked and swallowed.</p> <p>I held her tightly as my dick softened and slipped out of her mouth slowly. I kissed her neck and cheek and finally she pulled me to her and kissed me softly. This kiss was soft at first and I was sure that I could feel the urgency of her tongue, but there was more than that. I tasted the hint of my cum lingering on her lips. I guess that gave her idea for what to do next.</p> <p>"We should get out of this bed," she said suddenly. "There's something I want you to do."</p> <p>"Anything for you Ma," I responded.</p> <p>I picked myself up off the bed and carried her to the edge with me by her. "Let's take a shower together, I'd hate to catch you in a shower." She moved to the bathroom with me and we went into the bath.</p> <p>The water was cold just as I had imagined it would be. Julie didn't care so she turned to face me and closed my eyes with the motion of her lips. I felt the softness of her lips and then the coolness of her breath on my cheekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
