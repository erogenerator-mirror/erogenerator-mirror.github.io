I'm doing this and I want to know the difference."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>She had me in her bed. The next step would be to take off the panties. She knew I could handle this easily.</p> <p>"Yes. I think so."</p> <p>We were naked in seconds. She had the bra on for the first time. The first two times were quick. My first rush was that she wasn't wearing a bra. I wasn't surprised. My second first rush was that she wasn't wearing a bra. The third time I was surprised. I hadn't taken hers off in nearly 10 minutes. The third time she was wearing panties. As soon as I took them off I realized that I was in. It was as though the whole world was on display in front of me.</p> <p>"What you see is how I want you."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>In the process of undressing myself, I was taking off the rest of my clothing. I had her completely naked. Her body came into view as I took off her t-shirt and the bra. Her breasts were beautiful. I took time to appreciate the beauty of both of them. They were perky and perfect. Her nipples were very erect that made the color of the nipples so much darker.</p> <p>My eyes were drawn to them. They had never seen someone so beautiful and erotic at the same time. I just couldn't stand the embarrassment anymore. I was now naked as she lay on top of me. It was my turn to take some of the sexual tension into my sexual body. I grabbed the back of her legs and lifted them as high as I could. When my cock was level with her pussy, my body was touching hers.</p> <p>I moved my hand off of her ass and started to rub up the side of her. Moving up her thighs, my hand went to her belly and down over the front of her stomach. My fingertips were already aching and wet with sweat on the outside. I moved her right leg so that it was near the center of my body. Leaning up, I started to kiss her thigh. She closed her eyes and just lay on me.</p> <p>It was as though we were one. It was as though we were two animals on a blanket that had been spread wide for a living. She moved her hands down to my back and held me up. She moved her hands down and grabbed my ass. As I started to move my hands up her body, she pulled me down.</p> <p>I held her close and moved my body down to lay on top of hers. Our lips met. We kissed in the way that we had been kissing in each other's home. The intensity of it made the kiss seem more intense and lusty than we had ever done. We stayed together for an eternity. I held her tight. We held each other. I was afraid to move just to let her know that I loved and wanted her.</p> <p>Her mouth was moving over mine more and more. Her tongue was exploring my mouth. Her lips surrounded mine and began to explore me. She opened her jaw and her tongue slipped into my mouth.</p> <p>I opened my mouth and began to lick her tongue as it moved around mine, exploring every centimeter of my mouth. As our lips melted, our tongues moved like never before. Her body began to move in rhythm with mine. It was like we were dancing, as if it were going to be our first dance. We kissed like that for several minutes. Finally, we came up for air.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" she exclaimed, "What did you do? What did I do?"</p> <p>"You're beautiful. It was everything I imagined it would be. Are you ready?"</p> <p>"God, yes. This is the best thing I've ever experienced. You're so beautiful that I can't say how much I've been thinking about it. That was the best sex I've ever had." We lay on each other and caressed each other's body.</p> <p>"I'm afraid that I won't be able to do it again, though," she said, "I couldn't take this any longer."</p> <p>"That's OK, too. You look so lovely like this."</p> <p>"We're not done yet," she said. "You have to learn to do each other's body the way you would if we had done other people."</p> <p>As I was saying that, she got up and got a blanket from the night table. She put the blanket on the couch and sat on it. She lay back and opened her legs, inviting me to join her.</p> <p>I got to my knees and lay beside her. I moved over to her. I kissed her. I slid my tongue over her lips. She responded. She opened her mouth to receive me and her tongue moved inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
