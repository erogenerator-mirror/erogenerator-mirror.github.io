I asked her if there was a nice little local dive bar, but she said she wasn't feeling good and asked why. We had a couple of drinks and I sat on my porch for a minute and looked over at her looking for a spot.</p> <p>"What do you want? What do you need?" I asked.</p> <p>"I just needed a cigarette." she said. "You wanna smoke too?" I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Sure!" I said and took the place of the lounge. I lit a cigarette and she lit hers. I had a nice smile and she looked good looking, she had her blonde hair pulled back in a pony tail and her blue eyes sparkled. She had a little cleavage on show but still nice looking with big tits.</p> <p>"So do I have a choice of a cigarette?" she said. "I mean....we didn't smoke before......"</p> <p>She looked at me and smiled. "Well, there's always the pot," I said.</p> <p>I handed her mine and she offered to light mine while I put mine on my tab. When she finished it, she handed it back to me. "So what do you want to do?" she said. I didn't know what to say to that. Not knowing what to do with a woman I hadn't had the chance to approach.</p> <p>"Well," I said, feeling sorry for myself, "I'm not sure that I'm comfortable doing this. I mean, I'm married..." I said, sounding really hurt.</p> <p>"I know, I'm not so sure, we just found out tonight, it's just so weird. I know you didn't smoke before, I just don't want to offend you." she said.</p> <p>"Well, no, I mean I don't feel comfortable doing this, it just feels so weird." I said.</p> <p>"I know," she said. "It's okay, you don't have any choice." I got it. We both lit her cig and she held it and smoked. I took another one and she did the same. It was like we had been together all of the time. After we finished our cigs, we got dressed up and headed out to the parking lot. We had a couple of more drinks and a couple of joints then went back inside to watch a movie until the time we had to do a lap dance. She sat up against the headboard while I got on the pole and held her while I played. It was about nine and the lights were getting a little hazy. The room had gotten even darker, the curtains were open a little but neither of us noticed. I could see the outline of her large breasts pressing against the thin material of her top. I started to take off my clothes for her. "So", she said, "what do you think, should I take it off?" I didn't answer that, I just pulled it off and put it back on the ground. "So, are you still okay with it?" I asked.</p> <p>She looked at me and I just let her. She didn't say anything. I just moved closer to her and started kissing her. It was more than a quick peck on the lips. She grabbed at my cock with her hand and started to pull down my pants. I told her I thought it was a big one and she just smiled. We looked at each other and started to kiss again. Her tongue snaked across my lips as she pulled me deeper into the darkness. I took her head in my hand and pulled her even closer to me. I slid the zipper down and pulled her blouse open to expose her breast. It was a good size and a nice firm glob of flesh. I started to slide my hand round and around it, feeling her nipples under my fingers. I lowered my mouth onto her breast and started to suck as I rubbed her other breast with the same hand. Her hands were pushing at my back so she could pull me tighter to her. I started to get more and more turned on by what I was doing to her and her nipples got harder with the combination of the sucking and the feel of my cock between her legs. I pulled my hand back down and she took it and put it back to her pussy. I slid it back over and it glistened with moisture. I slid the tip between her lips so she could feel the warmth of my cock. I started to thrust it back and forth a little and she started to moan. She pulled more and more to meet my thrusts and she started to get louder. A few seconds later, I could feel myself cumming. I couldn't take it anymore and I pulled out and pulled her to me and kissed her.
