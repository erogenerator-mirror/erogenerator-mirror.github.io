She was stretched out so full, so deliciously empty but it still made her feel so sexy. He was sliding into her and she could barely move while he was in her, but the sensations her body was so good made her feel very sexy.</p> <p>"I'll let you do first," he told her as he withdrew, pulling her legs upwards until she felt his knob press against her tiny opening.</p> <p>"Do you ever talk to Jim?" she asked him, her eyes wide.</p> <p>"He's gone," he told her as he entered her again.</p> <p>He felt her body tighten round him as he began to fill her; she could hardly believe the feeling.</p> <p>"I told you you could do it," he added.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Come on, tell me," he grinned.</p> <p>"I'm so full, my legs, my arms and all," she moaned. She could barely concentrate on anything but how he penetrated her and how she felt.</p> <p>"All the men in the place, every one of them," he said quietly. "Do you want me to go slower? Or do you like Jim going all the way in?" he asked her again, his tone a little uncertain.</p> <p>"I can't," Rachel told him. Her head was still thrown back, her eyes were tight shut and she was completely under his control.</p> <p>"Tell me what you want," he asked her. His face suddenly showed concern.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me," she whispered.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"I know," she murmured. "In the car tonight. Please. Please."</p> <p>"Then let it be."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"You look like a slut," Jack said to Jim as he and his wife sat side by side on the bed. All three were laughing over some joke.</p> <p>"I could never be a slut," Jim laughed back.</p> <p>"But now you can be," Jack said with a wink. "You can have Jim. He can fuck your brains out as many times as you want. You can give him to whoever you want."</p> <p>"I can't!" Rachel cried.</p> <p>"Don't worry," Jack assured her. "Jim hasn't cum yet, not yet," he added gently rubbing her clitoris.</p> <p>"How does he feel about being a slut?" Jack asked Jim. "Does that make sense?"</p> <p>"It's so liberating," Jim said, his face still serious. He was smiling as he spoke.</p> <p>"Jim? You can put that thing on now. It will feel lovely," Jack said gently stroking his husband's face.</p> <p>"Oh yes, please yes!" Rachel cried looking wildly at Jim.</p> <p>"But you can't put your toy on then!" Jack said. She looked scared. She didn't know what to do. She was scared.</p> <p>When they had both got him into position and had moved their feet to make their asses accessible, Jim got up to leave and Jack had to move his own knees to keep him from moving too far behind him. They'd had a few drinks when the conversation went in a different direction.</p> <p>"Jim," Jim started the story. "Jim," he said to Mr. and Mrs. Jackson. He could see them talking quietly, but they were obviously very drunk too. He felt very sorry for the guys while he had been holding on to the very happy and horny wife, so the others had to work harder and for more than a half hour.</p> <p>When he could see the way they were chatting quietly, Jim knew that the girls were getting quite drunk judging by the looks on their faces. He was almost certain that they were plotting some way to humiliate him in front of Mr. Jackson. Maybe they were planning it that he had to be punished if he didn't tell the truth and that he would feel a lot worse for lying to Mr. Jackson. He suddenly remembered that he had to tell the truth and then he wondered what to tell Mr. Jackson in his own defence. He decided not to tell Mr. Jackson that he had already heard every word. It would give him just another little lie to justify what Mr. Jackson was going to do to him.</p> <p>"What are you waitingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
