She turned back to Karen, "But I could," she said, "Can't I, just go with the flow?"</p> <p>Karen gave Amy soft kisses on the lips, and then turned back to Sam, "Sure," she said. "What did you think?"</p> <p>"Oh, I guess that was a good one," Sam agreed, then glanced at Brian, "What do the rest of you think?"</p> <p>"He's not the only one," Amanda said, "I think we might just have the answer."</p> <p>"How long have you been talking to him?"</p> <p>Karen smiled at her friend, "I think it was just about five months. We're really getting along now, and he seems to really feel the same as we do."</p> <p>"I bet I do," Amanda said, "So anyway, how about this?" Amy nodded over Brian's cock and then looked at his sister, "You think we should swap?"</p> <p>Karen gave her a sexy grin, "What would you do if you had all the answers?"</p> <p>Amanda looked at her friend, "You'd better not be talking about your best friend."</p> <p>Brian laughed, and then glanced around the room at the group of couples who seemed to be getting very involved, "That's the idea," he said seriously. "Don't you think it's a good idea, too?" Amy nodded quickly.</p> <p>She smiled up at him, "It's the whole idea that's so funny," she said, "My Mom would agree!" She grinned widely, "All of you seem to like that, too."</p> <p>They all smiled at each other, "We'll think about it," Amy said, "But we have to get our swimsuits," she said, pointing to her suit on the side table. She grabbed her suit and her trunks and threw them, too, at Brian, and he laughed, "You know you shouldn't do this," he said, pointing at his sister and Amanda, "Not just them either!"</p> <p>"Well I'm not saying that you're not going to, I just don't want..." Amy started to point back behind them, where Sam was doing a quick check.</p> <p>"I know, just don't try to tell us." Karen grinned as Amy stopped in front of Sam and leaned across her and kissed her, "It'll probably take a minute or two," she added, "Don't you want to get the chlorine off that hot stuff?"</p> <p>"You're not kidding, you want it bad, right?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, and yes I do, but I want it too," Sam said. She raised her eyebrows, "I don't have to say anything."</p> <p>Amy leaned over and kissed her sister, "I bet you're ready aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes," She said, nodding slightly, "Now I want to see them. I don't want to break up all the peace. But I want you to kiss Karen," she said, turning to Brian, "Karen can you get the trunks off too."</p> <p>Brian grinned, he and Amy had been talking about it since that night in the parking lot. "Do it, Amy," she said to her friend, giving her the look that almost made her giggle, "Lets do it!"</p> <p>Amy was surprised as she watched Brian get the trunks off, and Amanda was holding his cock, which was standing up. She stared at him as her friend watched.</p> <p>"Brian honey, I'm not going to do that."</p> <p>He grinned back at her, "Then I'm not going to, Amy," he said quietly.</p> <p>Amy grinned, "But I can. If it's ok to, I can do that." She glanced around the room, she glanced at her husband, "He'll get it, I've agreed!"</p> <p>"I think you'll agree," Amanda smiled.</p> <p>Brian was smiling, but it was a serious face. He reached over and picked up Amy's blouse and handed it to her, "Here's what we're gonna do," he grinned, "Let's do something you'll really enjoy."</p> <p>Amy looked at him as she handed the blouse to him, there was a look in her eyes that made his cock jump. He grinned at her, "I think you'll really enjoy this, Sam," he said, and then turned back to her. He was standing there, Amy glanced at him, then she reached down and pushed him back on the bed where she straddled him, then reached down and lifted his dick to her. He lifted his head away, almost like he was trying to keep it from going right where she wanted it and thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
