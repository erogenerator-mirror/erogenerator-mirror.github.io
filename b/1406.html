I went upstairs to change and it sounded like a voice. I wondered who it could be."</p> <p>"You do remember my name from now on, don't you?"</p> <p>She nodded as she climbed the stairs to their front door.</p> <p>When she opened the door, she was startled to find it was in fact her parents. They were standing in the hallway that led to the guest bedroom and she saw her parents holding hands and laughing at something she was saying and all she could think was, "My God", as they stood staring at her. She started to speak but she couldn't speak because her mouth was dry. She felt so dumb as she looked at her parents. One of her mother's hands rested on the door and she started to turn her head to see who was standing there.</p> <p>She watched as a man in his mid forties came and opened the door to the room closing it in his face. At first she thought he meant she'd seen the man, he really did. The room was decorated with white cloths on the walls that looked as if they were made in New York. Then, all of the furniture had been covered with black silk from the top, and all of the windows were colored black or black and blacked by white trim. The man came and stood in front of her, waiting for an explanation.</p> <p>Just as she was about to ask him to leave, a girl came out. "Hi, guys, I'm Sarah and I'm sure you're excited about coming to see us."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm excited about it," one man said.</p> <p>"Yeah, we should have seen the man first," the other said.</p> <p>"He's our guest," one of them said quietly.</p> <p>"I'm glad we're invited; everyone else is in the other room," Sarah said.</p> <p>Sarah went to the window and looked out as the three men came out of the door. She saw her parents and they were laughing at something they were saying and so Sarah put on her best face and turned to Sarah. "I'm sorry for staring, I, uh, uh, um, do you know what happened?"</p> <p>When Sarah was sure they'd forgotten what had happened, the man on the bed took her hand and took her back upstairs to their bedroom. When he and one of the other men came in and stood in the hallway, they said, "I'm going to show you a great movie."</p> <p>"You like it?" Sarah asked her parents.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sorry that was so long ago," one of the men said.</p> <p>"It's okay. I was eighteen when I met Tommy. We hit it off really quickly and he's been with me ever since. I saw how the others looked at us, and when we were alone I realized how much they like you. And you're very beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you, it was so nice to meet you, I was really turned on by the whole experience."</p> <p>"Well, I would have liked to have had fun with you," the other man said.</p> <p>Sarah looked down at her face and saw some makeup on it. The makeup was smeared and she had a long-suffering expression across her face. The man standing in front of her said, "I really, um, didn't know you were that kind of girl."</p> <p>"My folks have been talking about going to the adult movies, but I just never really came up with a date. I haven't made up my mind to go."</p> <p>"That's good," her father said, "they've all been so nice and supportive when I asked them for an escort for me. And they're always ready to support me because I'm the youngest of their entire families."</p> <p>Sarah didn't believe in her parents being on the cusp of trying to put her in a wheelchair; although they weren't the least bit concerned about being forced into seeing a strange girl; they probably just assumed that she would be some kind of freak or something.</p> <p>There was a knock on the door and Sarah answered it. It was the woman she'd seen earlier that hadn't come into the house yet and was standing in the hallway. Sarah couldn't tell if it was the man who'd been standing in front of her or the woman, but they all seemed surprised at seeing her; Sarah was sure they were waiting for her to say something. Sarah didn't say anything. She didn't want to tell them that her first visit with the man she'd just seen had been on and off as well as on and off. She just walked in and they saw her.</p> <p>The woman was shorter than the man in their living room and looked to be slightly heavier than the man who wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
