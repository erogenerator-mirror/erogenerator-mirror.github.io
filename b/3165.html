"But, the other reason I have you down here is because you will not stand a chance if you don't do this assignment."</p> <p>"I don't know my boss?"</p> <p>"No, and if you are not here because you think you need more money, then what's going on?" the sales woman said, and as she continued, her face became even more stern. "I'm sure you can think of something else besides paying bills." "I guess so," I said, "just be careful! If you think I'll be home by the time you finish with the assignment, be sure to give me a call and let me know, we will try to see how things go when you finish here."</p> <p>The saleswoman smiled and stood up, before turning around toward the door.</p> <p>"See you then. You have another week's work here, so, just let me know when you finish with the assignment," she said, and as promised, she left the store.</p> <p>I picked some clothes off her dresser, and headed for home. As I was putting them away, I could see them in my mirror, and was even hornier by what I saw. These sales girls really are just messing with me.</p> <p>The next day, the weather was sunny on the sunny parts of the day. So, I drove back to the campus, and walked to class. I was in my classroom after all, so I just sat down and began to take notes. This day of my life was going to be great. The week was going to be awesome. I was going to be able to be involved in an erotic erotic sex situation with these girls for real. If I could find a chance, then it might be worth it.</p> <p>When the class began, I was in a great mood. They all got up from their desks, and walked to the front of the class. They took the papers out of my hands, and began to read while each handed the paper back with their eyes. I knew I needed to talk to my boss. I had been looking forward to this day for weeks now, and had some crazy ideas of what to do first. However, I couldn't have something that happened today, and get them to stop talking about it. Instead, I started to speak.</p> <p>"Hey girls, do you guys know my name?"</p> <p>"Yes sir, I have an assignment on my hands today," the sales woman offered.</p> <p>"Why? Are you a customer of the clothing department? Do you like the price of clothing?"</p> <p>"What?" They all seemed surprised that I offered to help them.</p> <p>"I have been asked to help you with some new shoes," the saleswoman said with a grin. "But you've really just come in without any money. I'll give you some clothes to pay for this job. My office is directly across the street. It's just across the way between the building where I work and campus. I'll meet you at my door at one-twenty in the morning."</p> <p>We didn't have a choice, so we agreed to come right to his office. My job would be done by one o'clock in the morning. I got out of my teacher outfit and headed to the elevator to go up to Mr. Jenkins' floor. I took my time climbing the stairs to the building and walked into his office. He had told me he had some clothes, which I was going to take. The clothes he had provided were something of a bargain, but they couldn't be that expensive. The clothes were in the back of the closet that were located up and down the hallway. He had told me just to have them on when I finished with the lesson on how to make good clothes.</p> <p>When I got to his door, it opened to a plain looking secretary with a cup of coffee in her hand and a small stack of folders underneath it.</p> <p>"Hi, I haven't finished this question of how to make good clothing." she said.</p> <p>He turned his desk chair back around and she said, "Please get naked right here." She grabbed my towel from my closet and wrapped it around me. I felt my shirt being lifted away, and was thankful that it was a short skirt that was so short as it had to come just below my knees. I pulled it up and felt my tight white undershirt being pulled away too, revealing all of my pink bra-pierced breasts. My blue panties were also being tugged down.</p> <p>"Please turn around," Mr. Jenkins asked.</p> <p>"No," they both said.</p> <p>He pulled the bra down and off of my top, showing me his shirtless torso as I laid down onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
