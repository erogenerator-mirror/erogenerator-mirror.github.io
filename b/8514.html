We continued kissing and I started to move my hand down, down, over her hips, into her crotch.</p> <p>"Hm?" she said.</p> <p>I stopped kissing her mouth and brought my hand to her waist. As I did, she ran her fingers through my hair, then pushed my head backwards so that my mouth was against her neck.</p> <p>"What the fuck?" she murmured, and pulled me down, onto her body, wrapping her arms and legs around me. My cock slid right into her, and we both gasped at the sudden fullness of it, and our mouths opened. I felt her hands on my butt and she pushed down for me.</p> <p>I was so wet that I could feel it sliding in and out of my pussy by the pressure I felt from her as she moved her hips, and her arms locked around me. I let go of her arms and brought them down to the cheeks of her ass. It took just a moment for me to find the spot for me, and I knew that I had found it when she reached behind and pressed my hands into the bed to encourage my fingers to go deeper.</p> <p>"Oooh yeah, finger fuck me," she moaned, and she let her legs go and clamped them around me as I slowly slid back and forth in and out of her. "Mmm, that's okay. You're in deep, aren't you? Just go faster. Oh fuck, I'll cum, just go faster."</p> <p>I kept working in and out, trying to go faster, but she was going wild with me. I could feel her fingers on my ass; pushing me down, then up; pressing harder as I pounded down into her. Then I felt my ass open up, so I slid the fingers deep back in, and we were still for a moment, before she came with a long shudder.</p> <p>In the dark, I could hear her breathing heavily as we continued to cum, and felt myself getting close.</p> <p>"Let's go back to the room," she said suddenly.</p> <p>"Uh-huh."</p> <p>We went back to her room, and she laid down. I knelt down in front of her and she opened her eyes.</p> <p>"Let me do you in the bedroom," she said to me, and pulled me on top of her, spreading her legs. She took my hand and led me into the room, then took me to the middle of the bed, then pulled me down to the mattress.</p> <p>We lay back down on the pillows and she pulled me close and began to kiss me. She kissed my breasts, sucking and biting on my nipples, then slid down my body, working her way to my bush, then my mound. Her mouth moved between my legs, then up my belly, and I felt my own hands slide down over her.</p> <p>Her head moved down and I felt the tip of her tongue. It ran across my hole and back up, and I opened my legs to let it in, and she licked and nibbled on me there. She went back down, only going up to the tip, and I felt it push past my opening and enter. I felt it move there for a moment before I felt the pressure from my pussy push against it.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck yeah," was all that came out. I couldn't believe this was happening. It was like we were two people in a dream, and we were just about to start it all over again. She worked my hole with her finger, then worked it slowly up into me. It slid in easily, and she slid her finger out as she pushed it in, again and again and again until I felt like I could go no further. And she did it again and again, sometimes slower and slower, and sometimes quicker.</p> <p>She got me to the highest possible level, which I don't think her knew where she was going. She wanted to get there, but I was right there with her and the pressure, and I just kept pushing my hips towards her. Finally, she got me right up to it, and I couldn't get more than one or two more of my fingers in me, and she had me on the brink, and we could still come up.</p> <p>"Mmm, that's it," she said as she got me going, but I wasn't finished. I had to have her ass. Then I got her on all fours with her legs spread wide, knees bent and her ass stuck up in the air. I reached around and put a pillow under her, lifting her up as I got in position behind her.</p> <p>"Wait, wait."</p> <p>Then I put it in, and she groaned as it slipped into her, but we moved in unison, me into her cunt, and she in my ass. She was still tightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
