He pushed two fingers into her and they found, indeed, the tiny, soft entrance that was there. They pushed slowly until he had a third finger joined them. "And this... yes, yes." With each push, she pushed back against him with the force of his thumb. "Oh god,"</p> <p>He put one hand on her tummy to hold himself up, her legs pressed into the bed, the other still resting on her hip. He pressed a bit more, the angle of his cock moving the tip up and down her slick folds.</p> <p>"Wait..." He hesitated and waited again. "Wait, please?"</p> <p>She pulled herself even towards him, and he thrust forward, aching with the pressure inside her. She shuddered, a small squeak of pleasure escaping from her lips and her eyes flashed, her head snapping up with pleasure. He pushed harder, his entire length now buried inside her and his eyes closed, the pleasure making him dizzy again. And then he paused, his hips moving as his cock moved and she clenched around him.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, god, yes, that's so good," she purred.</p> <p>"And this..." He pushed forward again, his heart pumping through the hard ridge of her hymen and through it into her canal. She groaned, biting her lip.</p> <p>"No, no, no..."</p> <p>"No, no!"</p> <p>He pressed harder and the skin of her hip pressed painfully flat against his and she clenched around him hard. He kissed her lightly, and in a blink, pulled out, then again came back in.</p> <p>"Fuck!" She gasped. "Fuck, yes! Fuck!" She grabbed his hips and pushed down onto him, hard. "No... no... no..."</p> <p>And he began to move, thrusting himself inside her, his body shaking with every thrust. The bed shook now, too, and he gripped her tightly, the skin of his forearms squeezing the muscles of her body tightly as her legs pulled him with each inward stroke.</p> <p>"I... you..." She began to moan. "...oh, baby, you are so... you're fucking me!"</p> <p>When he took her word from her, she was close. She couldn't take it anymore. She closed her eyes and threw her head back, her mouth open and her hips arching into the air, holding herself against him.</p> <p>"Fuck!" She cried. "Fuck! Fuck me! God..."</p> <p>He thrust hard. His hips smacked against her with a sound of unyielding sound of power, and his whole body shook with tremors and convulsions of release. He didn't stop, his body shaking and shaking, and she came again. Hard. And again. And again...</p> <p>He lifted her off the bed and lay her across it, keeping his weight off of her, his body trembling and his face pressed against her shoulder blades. She reached for his head and pressed him into her, letting him rest in her warmth.</p> <p>"How was that for you?" She heard herself ask, and he gave her an even bigger smile, but he was still shivering. She couldn't help it, and a new sense of trepidation swept through her.</p> <p>"It was good," he said, his voice still shaky from the intensity of the moment. "It was good in more ways than one."</p> <p>"Yeah, me tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
