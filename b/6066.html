We hugged a bit longer and then I told her, "My wife left me about a quarter of the way through my last appointment, it's been about three weeks!"</p> <p>"I think you've had a lot to drink," she said in a quiet voice.</p> <p>"I did, the alcohol was taking it's toll."</p> <p>"OK, I'm glad."</p> <p>"My wife had to keep her eyes closed and couldn't see me, but I still get it. She just wanted to make sure I was there."</p> <p>"OK, I'm ready,"</p> <p>She went off to make her husband happy. She came back with a tray with champagne, strawberries and whipped cream. She poured us each a glass a nice big glass of our favorite champagne and then gave me a glass of champagne herself. We ate the strawberries and drank the champagne, then she took my empty glass.</p> <p>"I'm really glad you stopped drinking," she said to me, "I did think it was going to be a lonely night."</p> <p>"My wife never drank any champagne, you wouldn't have believed it! I love having champagne in my hand for the last time."</p> <p>I sat there watching as she took a strawberry from the bowl, dipped it in the champagne, and then smeared the cream around her nipples and breasts. She got a mouthful of the whipped cream and then she smeared it all around her pussy and nipples. The cream was so delicious, it turned me on. I was going to cum as soon as I tasted it! She reached into her purse, came back out with fresh whipped cream and proceeded to cover over her pussy and breasts. Her nipples were pointing at me at most, the cream was still in her hand and I could see her little clit sticking out of it. She smeared the whipped cream all around a nipple making it as hard as a small cock.</p> <p>"I'm glad I had this," she said, "I guess I could let my husband put more loving on it for me."</p> <p>"Well I'm glad you got it too." I said, "I just want you to have all of that fun we love so well."</p> <p>I got up and went and got a wet dish and then handed it to her. I started with her breasts, and then slowly went down to her pussy. She smiled at me and told me to use the wet spot on the dish. I wiped the whipped cream off her pussy lips, she spread her legs more, then I took one of the whipped cream covered tits and began to wetly lube up her nipple. Once I was ready, I reached down and dipped my index finger into the water. I added a little cream so it was good and slippery, then I went back to her nipples. I took the tip of my index finger and rubbed the cream around a couple of her nip to make it slippery. I then inserted my finger to get it to go in, she held my hand steady. I then began to slowly move up and down on her nipples, just gently at first, then getting faster.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhh!" she said.</p> <p>I knew it was time to take her to orgasm. I continued to rub the cream around her nipples with my fingers, making it even wetter. I kept my finger moving the cream around and when she had it in to nice size, I quickly added a second finger. The feeling was wonderful. She began moaning and humping my hand and I was amazed that she was coming hard, her whole body was shaking. I kept rubbing all around her nipples and got her nipples hard again. I was going crazy touching them.</p> <p>"God, that's great," she said, "don't stop."</p> <p>I then picked her up and laid her back on the bed, the cream cream still on her breasts again, she spread her legs a bit. I knelt down in front of her and looked at her shaved pussy and then up at her face. We kissed deeply. She put a hand on my head and ran her fingers through my hair. We kissed some more and then looked each other in the eyes. She gave me a little look that said I wanted to taste her, so I slid my tongue out and got it to her wet lips. She opened up for me and I slid my tongue over them one at a time. She grabbed my head, and put her legs right up against my ears. I pushed my tongue in a bit and then slowly movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
