I blurted, trying to pull away but he was too strong, he grabbed my hips and rammed himself deeply into me. I gasped and clenched my muscles, gripping onto him for dear life as his cock slid further up me, pushing past my cervix and against my cervix.</p> <p>"Yessssss!!" I screamed as he slammed into me; making a slapping sound as our bodies collided. "Unggghh! Oh my ... I uuugghhhh ... you... uhhhhnnnnn!!" His hands gripped me once again and continued to pound me as hard and fast as he could get. The walls of my cervix were squeezing it now, rubbing on his cock and making it grow thicker and more erect. "Unnnnh!! Ahhhhhh!! I'mmm c-cumming!! Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!" With eyes screwed shut now I began to scream; a loud stifled cry of pleasure. I held myself there until the pulsations from his cock left my body and he pulled out completely. He held on to my hips and thrust himself back into my body with a final lunge.</p> <p>I could not believe that I had been given that wonderful orgasm. I had not even noticed his hands until they gripped tightly onto my bare hips, not even consciously but my legs were wrapped around him once again. I could feel his hard hot cock pressing on the soft, warm skin of my ass.</p> <p>"Aauugghhhh!! Fuck-meeeee!! I'mmmm c-cumming again!!" I screamed as I felt his cock pulse inside me and send its hot seed deep into me.</p> <p>"Mmmm!! Ohhhhhhhh!!" He growled, thrusting once again to the hilt inside me.</p> <p>For a few long moments we remained joined, his cock slipping from my cunt and our bodies finally sliding onto the bed. We were both breathing hard now and his mouth hungrily found mine, kissing me with a passion that was as intense as our orgasms. When he pulled away, I moaned my desire and desire again, "Please, Mark, I need you again."</p> <p>"You know I do, don't you?"</p> <p>"Uh-huh." I pulled him to me once again and kissed him deeply. "Just not inside me."</p> <p>Mark wrapped his arms around me and pressed me tight to him, "Mmmm, I'll never be done with you yet."</p> <p>We remained in that position for a few minutes; our bodies pressed, me on top of him; his chest against mine. I could feel his cock in the warm pool of my pussy and the pulsations of his orgasm as he tried to pull me off of him again. He kissed my lips again and said, "I've missed a good fuck like this. And I had a good night."</p> <p>"I could tell. You had better get home so I could finish packing."</p> <p>He gave me one more lingering kiss before turning away to go. "I'll have to leave early tomorrow. I've got to head to San Diego first to go back to work for one of my girls to see the kids. That should help him relax as well this afternoon."</p> <p>I kissed his cheek and smiled. "I sure hope so."</p> <p>He kissed the tip of my nose and rolled toward his side before snuggling close to me, his erection pressing against my belly. He kissed me tenderly on the lips. "I will definitely be around tomorrow to see you after I've got the kids in bed."</p> <p>"Good Night!" I kissed his cheek and rolled off of him, feeling slightly dizzy and unsteady as the last vestiges of my passion ran back to their normal place. I managed to put him to sleep before I got up to leave, putting my suitcase down in my room after the kids were asleep. I was alone and not feeling too ragged so I headed to the kitchen to make breakfast. I had breakfast going and I decided to stay in the bedroom and read while I worked today on my project. All I wanted was to get home and get some rest so that by the next day I might be back to working.</p> <p>Chapter 3-Bag Delivery</p> <p>I sat in the kitchen a few minutes longer and just put the dishes away when I heard soft buzzing from the hallway outside my bedroom door. I opened the door slightly. It was Mom but the bedroom door was closed, and she must be at work yet. I looked back at the room; it was clean, clean, and the sheets were clean. There was a small pillow on the bed and I put it to my left shoulder to lay on the bed.</p> <p>I opened the door a little more and saw that she was naked and I could see that she was looking at my body, my naked, naked, naked body, with her ownâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
