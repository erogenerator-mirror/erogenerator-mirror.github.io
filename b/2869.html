Besides, if she has a big orgasm while she does it, I'll probably be a little disappointed because I haven't cum yet today."</p> <p>"I think you probably have a big climax already."</p> <p>"Not yet."</p> <p>"Good. I want you to get me off too. I want you to make me cum while I play with my clit."</p> <p>My eyes widened.</p> <p>"You think?"</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>"Can I?"</p> <p>Her breath was catching.</p> <p>"Anything you want"</p> <p>"Ok, I want you to get on top."</p> <p>"You want me on top?"</p> <p>"Yes, I want you on top. I'm going to be on top of you this time."</p> <p>"You really want this?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do, but..."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Please do."</p> <p>Now her eyes widened again.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes, really. It's a surprise, not a 'come here quick'. You won't want it that quick."</p> <p>She put her finger on my lips and stopped me.</p> <p>"I want you to come, then, when you're ready to."</p> <p>I nodded and moved forward to settle into position.</p> <p>I had been playing with myself for at least an hour. My whole body tensed and I had been afraid I might not be able to hold out any longer. I had to be careful. As I shifted my weight a little, my hand started to wander down the front of my body, touching my clit a second time. My legs spread and I pressed it down into the bedding, opening my entrance to her fingers. I had never imagined that she could be this patient. Her tongue gently stroked me as her fingers continued to caress me, and it was all I could do to hold myself open and stay quiet. Before I could ask, she eased herself forward. It felt strange without the feeling of being inside of my body, but she continued her probing even as her fingers found my entrance.</p> <p>Her finger started sliding up and down my opening, as if she was trying to bring me to another orgasm. My clit began to stiffen even more, and she knew it too.</p> <p>"Please, please, don't tease, don't...ooh!"</p> <p>Then her thumb slid down, pressing into me, rubbing at my entrance. My legs parted automatically, and her thumb slid into my cunt.</p> <p>"Ah, ah, oh, yes, yes!"</p> <p>I was going to cum, right there. I felt her hand leave my clit, and a rush of feeling ran over and through me. I was going to cum as hard as I ever had before. And as I came it became, as it always is.</p> <p>I felt her pussy tighten around my fingers when I started to feel the climax. It had been building since before my shower, but now with her finger stroking my pussy it seemed to be building with more intensity every time. I was going to cum, hard too. I felt a rush that I had felt when I had had some of my first climax, just moments before.</p> <p>"Cumming, you fucking slut, cumming yet?"</p> <p>"Cumming, oh yes! Cumming!"</p> <p>"Yes. Cum, now!"</p> <p>As my climax started to subside, I continued to tremble from the sheer pleasure that was rushing through me. I felt her hands pushing me down onto the bed beside her, and then I felt her legs wrap around me. I was almost asleep before I felt her tongue again. My orgasm was coming, I was not sure how much longer I could last. But then, her mouth left my pussy and she lay beside me, with me just in the bed. I was still naked, and she reached out to pull me close to her. I was still covered from both sides with the sheets and mattress. She reached to touch me, and I could feel her heart beating again.</p> <p>"Now you can play with me. It's not necessary, I think we can take care of that."</p> <p>"Why, what's the use?"</p> <p>"I'm your Mistress."</p> <p>I had to think quickly.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I'll go easy on you if she doesn't."</p> <p>"I'm not sure if anything is going to happen, but I'm sureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
