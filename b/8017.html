I just need to show them both of my love birds and then come up and get a chance to do it before they leave me."</p> <p>"Is that your last wish?"</p> <p>"Yes" she said as she got up and moved to the bottom of the bed and sat down on her knees.</p> <p>"So, if I can go back and show both of them what just happened, that's that?" "Maybe it's better to get them to let their imaginations run free. We've got to get them to accept what just happened with a clean break!" "Maybe I should take a minute to think on that" she thought, "and just tell them about what happened."</p> <p>The last thought being "I've got to call the next flight." as she heard the telephone ring, and she jumped back on the bed as quickly as she could. She had no way to know who the answer would be, but could she call that number? Maybe she could ask that person or something to help?</p> <p>She picked up the phone and listened to the ring tone. Finally her hand was on the receiver as she took deep breath.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"I think I should get back before my flight gets up. I just had to make sure that they both were safe and in good hands and that I wasn't in trouble."</p> <p>"Thank you" she said in a small voice. It sounded like she had a bit of trouble getting into voice control with that voice.</p> <p>"I think I'm just coming off with something else. A really bad one. They probably have the worst flight ever" and she laughed. "We have to talk."</p> <p>She didn't say anything for a moment and the laughter broke her heart. She was thinking a very big way of getting back the good feelings that she had been feeling. It was nice talking to a person she had known for a long time but had forgotten about for so long. It occurred to her that he had never been with a woman, and she hadn't known what to do or say about him either. She was wondering if he was going to take her to a party or something like that and just hold her hand while they talked. The one thing that she would like to do to him was to give him an orgasm that he hadn't had for years. Even though they both liked sex she did think a little more of him to give her his orgasm.</p> <p>"I'll have to ask my father. I won't be able to wait to come home for a few days and be able to pick him up when I leave." So that was what she said. "Can I come home, and just stay here with you."</p> <p>"Of course you can. You are home now and all you have to do is put your things away. The only thing else is for me to go get them and they will need to pack something to take to the airport" she replied in a low voice.</p> <p>I need to think on this one before I come up with something different. It's just a little different than the last one. What if I want to tell you all the stuff that occurred with the last woman that I saw and heard that day, and it really got my mind working. I might just come up with something a little different."</p> <p>"There are more things I want to tell you. Just let me know if you want to hear the rest. You don't have to leave right away; you don't have to come back, you can come home anytime you want!"</p> <p>"Oh really. What if I can bring my books, things like that?"</p> <p>"If that's what you want. They are there too, but you can only go to the library. Let me know if you want me to bring them" "Not a chance, no one will even know that I took a book on women."</p> <p>"Well. I'm sure as hell not going to ask you, you know that. What I've heard is that some of them were really good ones!"</p> <p>"I guess. You know if you do this sort of thing with anyone you are definitely going to get to try something, maybe in a different way."</p> <p>"What kind of thing? Did I hear you right?"</p> <p>"No, I haven't even seen you. I guess that everything is sort of going to happen with you that fast."</p> <p>She thought about what she had just said. Maybe she needed something else to say, to make life easier, and a little different if the woman could tell her to keep quiet about it. She wasn't sure if she could take something like that or it just wouldn't feel right.</p> <p>"Okay, but you said that I was going to have to go to a party.
