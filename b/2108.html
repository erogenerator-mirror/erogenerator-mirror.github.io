I know what you're doing.' She had her arms around him in a hug and they hugged tightly and kissed like lovers.</p> <p>'If it wasn't so busy on Monday, I'd have been looking forward to lunch with my mate. I can remember one day my girl had so much fun in the garden with the little girls. I didn't have much chance, until I had met you.'</p> <p>'Me too. It was so much fun. Your friend in the garden too.'</p> <p>'And the two of you just happened to be the centre of attention when we went over to the house.'</p> <p>'I'd have liked to have done things at your mate's place, but he didn't want to. So I went over.'</p> <p>'Well, I hope one of us has a couple of pairs of hands to play with.' She grinned at him. 'I would love to have had a threesome with you if you and I are a couple.'</p> <p>'You might have to take off my panties,' he said smiling. 'I didn't think you'd do this with your mate watching.'</p> <p>'He won't be watching. I just wanted to have fun with my mate's friends.'</p> <p>They were both quiet for a bit then Dan asked, 'Does the neighbour think the girls are in touch about the rules the other way and don't ask the neighbours questions?'</p> <p>'I would think he doesn't ask about all that stuff so he doesn't make any big deal about his family or the odd relationship he has with his mates.'</p> <p>Dan turned to look at her and saw she was looking at him again. 'But you're so attractive. It's hard not to stare at them.'</p> <p>"Sorry."</p> <p>'Don't apologise, it's only half true. He's right I've always been attractive.'</p> <p>He grinned then turned to her with a very warm smile. 'I'm not the jealous kind, but I've no complaints about the way you look."</p> <p>"I don't think my friends would be happy about that being a bit of a show for me. It's not like what you guys are sharing every week."</p> <p>'Do you think there's a problem between you two?'</p> <p>"No, I think nothing will be. You two are the best.'</p> <p>'You're a lovely couple, both of you,' She had a big smile of surprise on her face. 'I thought there would be a lot more than just the three of us to be nice about. Asking if I was your friend and what we were doing or where we were going to go.'</p> <p>He just laughed gently and rubbed her shoulders gently. 'No it's not that. The three of us are all pretty and friendly with each other, but nothing has happened.'</p> <p>'You haven't had anything to do yet with his friends.'</p> <p>'No, when I met you they didn't want to talk about you. They were looking at you just like they had looked at me before. They both knew what you were doing. Why did you put on that dress all that time? We wanted to know you liked it!'</p> <p>She squeezed his hand around her and kissed him deeply. 'No, they didn't want to talk about it. There wasn't a thing that happened.' Dan reached down to her and put his hand on her left thigh. 'You're just the type of girl you could make those things look good and not even want to touch.'</p> <p>'I know. I thought about it for a while after I saw your panties. I hadn't realized until the first pair were showing that I had an excited imagination. But I was thinking that I was a bit out of practice and that I should feel that way all the time.'</p> <p>'I thought there was a lot to feel.'</p> <p>She had a serious look in her eye. 'No, I think there might be. But I was also worried a lot, because I didn't know you had so much experience with girls. I hadn't really thought that much about it before with guys or my girlfriends. All the girls were beautiful and I was pretty sure you weren't your boyfriend's type. But with me, that was a little different.'</p> <p>'I'm a girl who likes to get her own way sometimes,' he smiled then kissed her and put his left hand on her cheek. 'You have a stunningly sexy body.'</p> <p>'I still like to think I'm attractive,' and she kissed him again.</p> <p>The kiss lasted a little longer with him holding her firmly in his arms but she still knew he had to take her home. They pulled their clothes out of his pants and straightened themselves up. Dan said, 'Are we leaving? I think I want to go home with you tonight, and I wouldn't really want toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
