The other part of it was this little adventure; no-one knew it was my husband, his wife and his friend inside, and that we were all alone in the room where the bed was made. The only place we'd been this night was on our own couch. I sat opposite him on the edge of the bed; he took his time with me, moving around and trying to get me to lie down, and that's how a night like this is fun.</p> <p>As his hand made his way down my body he whispered, "I like your tits," and I smiled as they jiggled against my chest, making him crazy. He reached under my blouse without taking it off. I shivered in delight at his touch, my nipples tightening and getting hard. "And, there's nothing like having two hot, hot, horny guys on the bed next to you," he said, "with plenty of love to do with each other."</p> <p>I grinned at him, the way my husband had been in the past. He slid slowly onto his back as I slid right next to him with his hands at first, but then he took my full breasts in his hands, and caressed them gently, making them shine. He started kissing my neck and ear, sliding his mouth up to my ear and biting my earlobe. I almost screamed with desire and love, but I fought through it, wanting him to take me, to please me, make me feel as wonderful as he was making me feel right now.</p> <p>In the end, I pulled his face to mine and kissed him, letting him get up slightly so we could kiss and play with each other's mouths. I'd been craving that for such a long time, and when it came, I was ready to burst. "I love you," I said to him in a soft voice.</p> <p>"I loved it too honey," he replied, "and I love it when we make love tonight." He leaned closer to me and brushed my hair aside, kissing me as his hand started sliding up and down my belly.</p> <p>He started pushing my skirt up, slowly, and I helped him, lifting my hips to help him. He pulled my skirt away, leaving a bare white skin between our bodies from which the pale of my buttocks and pussy could be seen. It was so lovely, and I loved it when he touched my pussy. He had to have tasted me; he had no idea that it would get so wonderful. He kissed me, taking his time. I was already incredibly wet and it made the teasing sensation of his tongue on my cunt feel exquisite, just feeling it was so good. As he reached my thigh, his tongue was on my whole leg, making me squirm against him.</p> <p>As he slid up my leg, I felt his tongue just at the edge of my pussy, and then slide up again. I moaned. I think it was the most erotic thing I'd ever experienced. As he slid all the way up, my lips closed on his tongue and I tasted the juices of him running down my leg. Oh God that was wonderful. He tasted incredible.</p> <p>My body was shaking at the excitement of his touch against me, like a little girl's that has been asked to be shy and want. His hand on my thighs was the sweetest and sweetest thing I'd ever felt. As he continued to slide up and slide down, I started begging him for him to put his finger inside me. "No, honey, please don't do that," I begged, afraid of what his reaction would be, afraid if he'd say no he would.</p> <p>He smiled. I couldn't believe how wonderful it felt when he slipped his finger inside me, and kept up his teasing movement. He kept sliding his finger up and down my vagina, making it slippery and smooth as it slid in and out; I was quivering and wanting it very badly. But he kept sliding it in and out. He loved that he was making me feel so good and so good to him, and it also turned him on. He'd never really thought about being with a woman; but he knew he'd get there the second he'd kissed me after so many years, and it gave him something better to do then to stop and start all over again. Now he was going to; and I was so excited I could barely breathe, and I could've screamed, except that his mouth was too tight for that.</p> <p>"Take me, I love you," I told him.</p> <p>"I'll kiss, I'll lick," he said back, and he slid back down and kissed me all around my pussy. "Is this what love is," he asked, "is love," he repeated softlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
