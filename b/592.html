He stepped back and walked back to the door. I walked out of the room and headed for my car.</p> <p>"Let me get that. It's been a long day."</p> <p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out a pair of keys.</p> <p>"Where to?"</p> <p>"It's up by the interstate around 4."</p> <p>"You're on."</p> <p>I drove the twenty miles to my house. I didn't know what I was going to do until the engine idled and I heard it stop. I looked at the number on the door to go. When I saw it, I turned around and drove up to the house. I picked up a note pad off the counter and looked inside. It was my ex-wife. I was in love with her. We were just dating and all. Now, I wanted to be alone with her in the house. As I pulled into the driveway, I put the pad down and looked at her picture on the door. The picture of her perfect body lying with her legs hanging over the side of the table.</p> <p>It was a picture of my ex-wife. We met while we were still dating and I thought our time together was over. There was no way she was in love with me.</p> <p>"We're done." She was standing in the doorway looking at the room. I could see the tears rolling down her cheeks. She said, "It's over."</p> <p>"That's not the end." I reached across her and held her hand as I leaned over and kissed her cheek. We both turned and stood there for a moment, holding each other.</p> <p>"I'm sorry that we never got to move on."</p> <p>"It's okay. I'm in love now."</p> <p>"I know. I know." She ran back up to her room. I had to sit down, but I was grateful for that. We sat on the bed and talked for hours. We talked about our lives, our jobs, our feelings about each others' marriages. We talked about how much we wanted to end it. I was so grateful for her taking me into her arms with her beautiful body hanging over the table. We talked about how much we meant to each other.</p> <p>"I've finally made up my mind." I said softly.</p> <p>"Me too." She leaned over to kiss me.</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>We fell asleep in each others armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
