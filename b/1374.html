I walked back to the house. I heard a loud noise behind me and I looked over to see my friend running into the house. We all went inside and I locked the door and told him to strip. He started to sit down and I said to him, "I think a little more clothing is in the shed."</p> <p>I started to strip and after I threw his clothes out of the house, I laid down on my bed. He went over and sat on the bed facing the window. It got to be about a half hour before we heard my friend come into the room. I looked over as my friend walked across the room and grabbed his cock. He started to put it in her mouth. He didn't want to get away, as a few of our neighbors had seen him naked. I sat back as my friend fucked her mouth. Then, he got off the bed and he walked around the room. I heard him turn on the light and walk back upstairs to the bed.</p> <p>He dropped down on the bed. I looked into his eyes and just said to him, "I want you inside of me now."</p> <p>He laughed and got on the bed. He got in between my legs and he laid on me. I let out a soft moan as he entered me. The feeling was incredible. I opened my legs to let him in. His cock went in my pussy easily. It was amazing. There was no feeling as it was my pussy being split apart by him. It felt so perfect. I grabbed him by the waist and he began to fuck me.</p> <p>He told a little voice in my head, "I'm going to cum."</p> <p>I closed my eyes and let him fill me up. His moans and thrusts filled the room and I could hear our bodies slap together. He came inside of me. We held each other a couple of minutes before we looked at each other, smiling. I said, "Damn, that felt better than I ever remember. Thank you."</p> <p>He smiled and said, "That was wonderful. You know how I like to talk dirty to you."</p> <p>I replied, "I can't believe that I let him fuck me. Your cum is so creamy."</p> <p>He smiled and smiled at me and said, "I never knew it would feel good. It feels great. Do you remember that we had dinner here tonight and I brought home some food?"</p> <p>I asked him, "You should have brought back something special."</p> <p>He said, "You'll need something special to remember the evening."</p> <p>I smiled and said, "Okay."</p> <p>We made love again. A few minutes after we got off at the house, my friend came back downstairs. I told him that I was going to go do the dishes while he and I continued our walk. He said, "Okay."</p> <p>We went to the bathroom without having to say anything. After that night, things seemed to be the way they used to be. That's when I started to make my way across the entire town.</p> <p>By the time I got home, I was still feeling better. Even though nothing was going on, I was looking forward to going back to my classes. I didn't really care much about classes anymore. All I knew was that if I was going to have sex and if I had my hands on guys, I needed to feel a man's cock inside of me. I had to have some.</p> <p>The next weekend I stopped at the bar and I decided to stop in. I didn't plan on it being the last time, but the idea of seeing another man had me excited. While I was in the bar, I started to feel nervous. Part of me was hoping that he would leave.</p> <p>I had decided to buy myself a drink when I went in. I was nervous as well as excited. My nerves were a little mixed up. I guess I shouldn't have worn a skirt when we walked in. I know it was just to go to the bathroom and get ready for him. I didn't know what to choose with just a short skirt and heels. I picked a white button down, red dress shirt (he liked that), black skirt with a short scooped neckline and white pumps.</p> <p>When I saw him, I could see a little bit of his body. I was excited with him. I had never been that nervous before. After he got out of the door, I turned a bit red and just said, "Oh, sorry." I smiled and said, "I'm just glad you stopped by. Why the surprise?" Before I could continue, he put his arms around me. He gave me a kiss. Before I could react, he took my hand and said, "Come with me."</p> <p>We got into the limo and made our way back to the house.
