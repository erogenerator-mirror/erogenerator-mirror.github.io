"It's not the best way to think."</p> <p>"It's the best time to think," he said.</p> <p>"No, it's not the best time to think."</p> <p>"Why? What are you talking about?"</p> <p>She shook her head with a smile that he could feel and told him. He didn't have her in his head, and she was in his. As much as he enjoyed the control, he hated the fact that they were having sex without having her. "I dunno. Maybe because there's something so special about making them have this kind of relationship."</p> <p>She stopped talking for a second and he saw the sparkle in her eyes. "We have. You said you'd never had a relationship that didn't start with sex. What happened? Last night?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nothing. You had sex?" He asked, shocked by what he heard. "Is that really your life?" he thought, and shook his head. "Can you feel that?"</p> <p>She nodded and smiled. "I can still taste her, but we have all night. I can kiss her."</p> <p>"No, we don't. Why?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I'd probably enjoy doing so if she got out of line again. It's never been a big issue with me."</p> <p>"You're just saying this to hurt her," he said.</p> <p>"We've already touched that little pink pussy. No, I'm not doing that. It's not for you or anyone like us or you. Besides, let's get out of these clothes so we can feel each other more closely and she can be sure you're not trying to play around."</p> <p>He thought for a moment. "Okay."</p> <p>"I love her. She's really good for us."</p> <p>"I can give her that."</p> <p>She didn't look up from her book for the moment. "What?" she said. "You know this isn't a good idea."</p> <p>He laughed loudly at the thought of her doing her own writing.</p> <p>"Let's get dressed and get out of here," he told her.</p> <p>"You think?" she told him, taking off her panties.</p> <p>"What do you think I mean by that?" he asked, looking down at her with a smile.</p> <p>"I mean if we're being watched, how does that make us like each other?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well, it does. When I watched you, it made me so hard. You really looked so sexy today."</p> <p>"So did I," she smiled. "You really like that."</p> <p>He laughed again.</p> <p>"Do you do that often?" he asked, looking up at her as his hand slid between her legs.</p> <p>She nodded. "Yes."</p> <p>"You know that you're not really wearing any panties," he told her.</p> <p>"Not if I was wearing mine," she laughed.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I want you to do that," he said. "You don't like it?"</p> <p>She nodded. "It doesn't really bother me. It's nothing. Do you wanna come back to my room or is it all right for us to do something? I'll let you know."</p> <p>"Your room," he said. "No. Maybe I'll just go take a shower. That's okay with me if it's just one," he said.</p> <p>She looked up at him once in surprise and nodded. She picked up her book before looking at him. "What?" she asked.</p> <p>He stood up and began to undress.</p> <p>"No," she said firmly. "Don't. Take my clothes off, okay?</p> <p>"I understand," he said, and pulled off her bra, letting his shirt fall to the floor. "How about I give them to you?" he asked, and she raised a brow.</p> <p>"Oh, okay," she whispered.</p> <p>He reached behind her and unhooked the bra, taking it off her shoulders with the strap. He had never seen a body that was this sexy in his whole life. Her nipples were hardened and stood up proud. He reached over and cupped one of her breasts with one hand, lifting it up to his mouth. She gasped when he kissed her nipple.</p> <p>"I'm going to leave the rest for you to see," he told her. "Do you want me to leave the rest for you or give them to me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Both of them," he said. "I was gonna give these to you before but since you've never been in them, feel free." He slid his hand inside her panties, feeling her naked pubes. She was already wet and swollen, and he could feel the wetness on his fingers. He brought them upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
