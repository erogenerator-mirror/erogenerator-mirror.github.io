I just didn't know what to think! I had to ask him. "How do you feel?" He was calm as could be, but it was a start.</p> <p>"I feel like an ordinary woman. I like you!" He moved toward me and planted the palms of his hands on the arm of the couch. "I felt that I could trust you!" His eyes scanned over my body and caught mine, "You are a good looking woman."</p> <p>His deep masculine voice brought me back to the present. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too." I smiled as he took my hand and brought it to his lips. "Would we be the kind of lovers we always spoke of?"</p> <p>"We can be just as you are, if you would like." His head bobbed in my hand.</p> <p>"Yes, I think about you all the time."</p> <p>"I know I do!" He grinned. "I can't help it, I see all of you!" He leaned in and kissed me again. My hand slid downward to his stomach and found the waistband of his bathing suit. He pulled it up quickly and off.</p> <p>I leaned forward and pulled him to me. I wanted to feel him again. My face was level with his. We stared at each other for a few long seconds, staring into each others eyes. I slowly ran my hands over his strong arms. Finally I gave in and slid them over his smooth chest and found the hair in his pubic hair. I ran my hand gently over his chest and belly, trying to caress every inch of it. When I got to his cock, I couldn't believe how large it was! I rubbed with it a little at a time, but my fingers never got close to what it was like from just looking at him. I had to taste what I had before, but just as I thought he was about to come, he backed away.</p> <p>His body shined with sweat, his hair was slicked back and he did most of the work with it. "Are you ok?" His eyes met mine again.</p> <p>"You can't kiss him!" I stood up and turned to face him. He held one of my hands, pressing it against his chest. He kissed my fingers that were still covering his now growing cock. I let my lips move slowly up his neck so they were close to his ear. "Don't," I whispered, "I want that too."</p> <p>He leaned back a little and kissed the tip of my index finger. When he did this, his cock jumped in my hand. I squeezed and released it a couple of times, then he reached down and put it back against his body.</p> <p>"I think we're going in," he said as he began to pull his bathing suit back down.</p> <p>"No." I took his hand and started to lead him back to my couch to sit again. "Lie down."</p> <p>He did as I asked as I went into my room. I came out a minute later. Standing in the doorway, his cock standing straight out, and his cock on display, I told him to lie down on the couch. I followed his eyes and moved up to face him. I sat on his face and started kissing him again. He put his hands into my hair and pulled me close. I felt him grow and swell against my stomach as our kissing started. "Mm hla." His voice was rough as he whispered, "I love you."</p> <p>My hand moved between us and I caressed him with the softness of my fingertips. He put his arms around my neck and pulled me close, rubbing the tips of his fingers into my flesh. My hands were slowly and hesitantly moving up and down over his stomach, over the top of his bathing suit, across his chest. I could feel his nipples hardening with excitement. When my hand started to move lower, his eyes closed and he bit his lip and pushed his hips up toward me. His breathing got heavier.</p> <p>I moved to my knees on my couch and kissed his knees before I opened his suit. His cock stood straight up from his body like a tower building in a jungle of flesh. I could not resist his hard cock as I brought the tip to his lips. We could both smell and taste our juices mingled as he kissed me deeply. My hand started to play with him, feeling his manly hardness through the thin membrane that separated us. Finally, I felt a drop of precum slip on the tip of his cock and I opened my mouth to taste it. He tasted salty from the friction of our lovemaking.</p> <p>His breath was coming in gasps as his body responded to me. I moved back a little so I could place my body over his. I placed both my hands on either sideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
