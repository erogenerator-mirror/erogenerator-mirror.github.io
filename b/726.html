Rachel asked as they started the fire. "Is it really necessary?" She asked again.</p> <p>I pulled her towards me and gave her a kiss, "No," I told her.</p> <p>They stood there, facing one another, silent for a long moment until Rachel said quietly," I've never done this before. I never knew anything like you did." Then she said, "I'm glad we hooked up with a real person that can look after you so I'm not going to let it go to waste." She grinned as she reached up and kissed me again.</p> <p>I smiled and told her. "And I'm glad to have you here. I'm glad that I'm not alone."</p> <p>"Me too." She whispered. "I've never been alone before and I want to learn how to share it with you. Will you let me?"</p> <p>"I'd love to," I said as I kissed her one last time passionately.</p> <p>"I'm glad that you can share with somebody," Rachel told me. "I'm so happy that I can be of service to you. And I can't wait to tell you about the time I spent with you."</p> <p>Rachel and I were sitting in one of two bedrooms, kissing and caressing each other all over. My little Rachel had grown into quite the sexy young woman. Her small round breasts looked great against the t-shirt. And I loved the feel of her breasts encased in her tight T-shirt clinging to them like a warm wet towel. In my mind, I had always thought of a young woman's breasts as the soft breasts of an older man. Now I had thought them as large soft breasts, soft, warm, soft. And I now knew more than anything in the world. I loved her body. I loved her kisses, the way she tasted, the way she touched. And I loved her smile.</p> <p>The next day we spent a day together just enjoying each other's company. We talked a little about sex and how much we liked it. In truth, I'm an amateur at guessing which parts of a woman's body do more to excite a man. And if given the chance, I can't remember ever being attracted to a woman's skin, particularly not her tits. Rachel loved me telling her about my past relationships and sharing her story, but in the end, she was my best friend. She was my one and only friend.</p> <p>After a very long day, we got up early and made a good breakfast before she drove me to my new office downtown. We spent most of our time together in her car. She had brought lunch and a few sandwiches, and we watched a little TV and just sat down and had lunch, sometimes just talking about old times, and other times just a bit of catching up.</p> <p>We were sitting on the sofa in the dark, watching one of our favorite re-run shows when Rachel reached back in her purse and pulled out a small black box. She opened it and slipped it down into my hands and smiled when the familiar smile came over her face.</p> <p>"Happy to see me as well as to have a new friend," she said as she took my hand and put it back in the small box.</p> <p>"You are a treasure," I said, "and it will please me very much to make it known that I'm as good a treasure as you said."</p> <p>"I guess you'd better believe it," she said as she stood up and came to me, pulled my hand back up, and kissed me passionately and lovingly on the lips. "I wanted to thank you for bringing lunch today, and for making me feel better about my depression."</p> <p>"That's okay," I said with love. "Even my depression is your fault. You're the one who helped me. You're the one who saved me from this terrible loss."</p> <p>She kissed me again and said, "I'm glad to hear that." Then she kissed my cheek and said, "But one more thing," she added as she knelt down and gave me a brief kiss. "You can still feel that you're my friend."</p> <p>"Thank you," was a teary and trembling response to my last words.</p> <p>"That's good," I said, "because that will be that much of a compliment to you, too." Then we sat holding the phone in our laps, listening to the news. In a moment, we heard the sound of the elevator stop at our floor.</p> <p>"Thank you," Rachel said with a smile. "I'm excited to see you." Then she stood up, holding my hand and kissed me again.</p> <p>I looked at Rachel and said, "Now we know a lot more about our past. In a couple of hours we'll know everything that we need toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
