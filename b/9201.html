"Because we haven't seen the film yet."</p> <p>"Oooh, no you don't," she protested.</p> <p>"I didn't say you need to say you don't. Go ahead," I whispered to her as I pushed her hard up against the wall. "And don't move a muscle."</p> <p>"Oooh...that hurts," she moaned while putting her left hand back on her stomach and pushing her chest up against my cock.</p> <p>"Ouch, stop it," I panted in between breaths as my fingers began their slow work of her left nipple with a vengeance. She began pushing against the wall as my cock began to swell within her cleavage. Our eyes locked as she looked up at me and then turned her head towards me. I had her in a full sexual frenzy again and she was making loud gulping sounds as I continued my relentless attack. Within minutes I could feel her right nipple begin to tighten as her orgasm approached. The first wave of pleasure overtook her as her body convulsed. She leaned forward to rest her forehead on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Don't move," I said in a soft tone as I pulled my cock out of her cleavage and stood up from the couch. I continued to stare down at her in disbelief. "You've been doing that a lot." I looked into her eyes. "Now what am I gonna do with you?"</p> <p>My mind wasn't so clear after that first session with Heather. She had been the one to take a chance by forcing my mind to focus on her, to think that maybe I wasn't worthy enough for her anymore. Now, with a new persona and a new relationship, my mind was a blank and there was no love or respect for her now. I was simply a new lover in a new relationship. I took my hands and slid them up over her body, feeling her soft flesh under my hands as I caressed her. She moaned as I began moving my hands under her clothing, sliding up and down over it.</p> <p>"God, no," she moaned lifting her arms so I could remove them. She turned away from me and I slipped her panties off.</p> <p>"What? No." She responded with exasperation as I slipped my middle finger in her dripping pussy and began massaging her g-spot.</p> <p>"Take off my shirt," she said pulling her arms up, exposing her body fully. The moment the words escaped her lips she realized for the first time that her breasts had gotten even bigger than they had before. They were capped with nipples that only seemed to grow bigger with each heartbeat. After a few moments she began to reach up and remove her shoes and socks. When she was completely nude I let her turn herself around.</p> <p>"Do you like this?" I asked her as she backed up and slowly backed toward the wall. Her breasts were now fully on display as her nipples were rock erect with desire. I took her hands and began kissing the backs of them lightly before moving them down to feel her tight ass. "Is this what it's like to be naked here with you?" She asked with a wicked grin as her breath quickened.</p> <p>"If you take off your clothes, I'm sure you'll make me come back to see me naked," I said as I moved back between her legs. I took her knees and pushed them back towards her tits. This time I didn't put my cock down by her vagina. Instead I moved into position behind her.</p> <p>"I didn't bring a strap on," she said as she brought her hands up under her breasts and began massaging them as I pushed myself into her. "But you can come in me," she said as she lifted her rear. "Do it."</p> <p>"Do it," I responded as I began pressing myself against her. "Oooh." When I finally penetrated her, she began working her hips against me while she held her arms up against the wall.</p> <p>"Oooh," she yelled as I began sliding in and out of her. "That feels good." Her words cut through the air as our bodies began the rhythmic motion they had begun before. I could see the sweat bead on her chest and could tell that it was beginning to look more and more difficult to hold all of this back. "Oh, God, yes, yes," she shouted as my arms began to tighten on her.</p> <p>"Tell me," I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Uhhhhh..." she moaned as a powerful orgasm racked through her body.</p> <p>I was lost in a world of ecstasy. We held each other tightly as her mind seemed to be focused on the waves of pleasure we were both feeling. We were just in my head as we kissed passionately.
