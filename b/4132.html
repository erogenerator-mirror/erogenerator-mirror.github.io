All the kissing had sent butterflies through my stomach. For me, it was not so bad. We were having a great time and I was enjoying myself. I felt like I was being a princess and I loved being that way. After my kiss, I looked at my hands and they were all sticky. I got out of the bed and went to take a shower, but decided against it. I couldn't find a clean one in the bathroom.</p> <p>I was going to take another shower at home that night when I got up to go. I got dressed and sat down at the dining room table and read the paper. We chatted for a little while and then I put the paper in front of the window and told her I was going to make dinner.</p> <p>She asked me to take it down the basement, so we could eat together. We sat at the table and began to eat. We talked and laughed together for a long time. The longer we ate and talked the more comfortable we got.</p> <p>About halfway through our meal, a car came down the street. We got out of the chair as the driver got out of the car and got out. The driver came around the car and got in the passenger side and they drove away.</p> <p>I got up to look at her and gave her a hug. We kissed as I went back down the stairs. We kissed several times, and when I pulled back she was smiling.</p> <p>"I had a great time! And you, that is!"</p> <p>"You too?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, thanks!"</p> <p>"You were funny."</p> <p>"Well, thank you, too!" I smiled and kissed her cheek.</p> <p>When I got home at around 8 o'clock, my husband called. It was about a minute before 9 o'clock. He was going to stay with a girlfriend, but had told him how tired he was being at the bar tonight, and that her parents were going to the golf course for the day.</p> <p>I had not called him earlier so I assumed he didn't answer. I got out of the house and went to make dinner. Around 9:30, I came downstairs to wait for the phone to ring. I wanted to see how the call was going. When it did ring, I waited a minute and waited for it to go to voice mail. When it went to voicemail, I picked up the phone.</p> <p>"Hello!" she answered on the first ring. I listened for a couple of minutes and she said something else. I knew what she was talking about. "Do you have a brother?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said and got up and kissed her. We kissed some more and she put her arms around me. She whispered in my ear. "I want you."</p> <p>"I do too," I whispered back. "I have a friend that works at the bar. Would you like to meet her? It would be nice for us to meet her and get something out of it!"</p> <p>"You are too kind!" she answered and said my name in the most sexy voice she knew.</p> <p>I pulled back, kissed her quickly and said, "I'll talk to her later."</p> <p>"I love to see you kiss her too," she said.</p> <p>I knew it was important that I told her I found out everything about her. I just didn't know if I could. The second it hit me, I was going to be the hero. I knew exactly how she would react if she knew, and that she would probably hate me.</p> <p>"I promise!" I told her.</p> <p>As we kissed and talked more and more we kept to our routine of drinking and joking, telling jokes and looking sexy. I was enjoying our conversations. Her voice always had that "I'm not into it" edge to it. It was just music to my ears. All I could do was smile at her. By now there was no one in the room. She and I were very close.</p> <p>"If you make me crazy, I'll kill you," she said, finally.</p> <p>"I'm not doing anything you don't want to try," I told her.</p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>I could tell that the kiss had got to her and she was really getting into it. I wanted to be sure that I kept my promise. I had to do something.</p> <p>"There is a movie on my way to the restaurant and if you would tell me, I might have a good time tonight," I told her.</p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>"Do you want to go pick it up after work?"</p> <p>"Sure!" she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
