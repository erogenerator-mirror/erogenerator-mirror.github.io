I'd never given it much thought in the past - I didn't need much help just getting up. After a shower, I changed into my regular dress and went out for a day's shopping.</p> <p>I did a little bit shopping: I bought some dresses and skirts and other purchases, and I bought things to see and do. I bought a couple of things to wear to the mall. I also purchased a very sexy pair of black stockings, along with some high heels, and I spent an entire day buying them all. I also bought a very sexy set of lingerie - "I'll be a lingerie model for the entire day!" I thought it was incredible and I wanted to try it out. I also bought a really sexy dildo and a butt plug. I also bought a short version of the same pair of very high heels. I bought some new earrings and several more bracelets.</p> <p>Before I knew it, I was a little late for my date with my girlfriend. Not only was there a really sexy young woman, she was also a very sexy and very sexy woman. I found myself fantasizing about her as I sat on the curb just watching her walk by, trying to imagine what it'd be like to be between the girl's legs.</p> <p>I arrived the next afternoon to pick up my girlfriend for dinner. It was a strange feeling just being her as her friend, but it was so nice just being around her. She wore a short pleated, knee-length dress that was completely unbuttoned but that came down very low, showing just a hint of tummy, showing off the very long legs that I'd guessed to be her best feature on the young, attractive blonde.</p> <p>It seemed she had no idea as to what she looked like, and I'm guessing I'll never know. I was just enjoying the moment and being with her, her being so nice. It felt great to see someone like her again, and all I knew was that it felt good to be around her.</p> <p>As she got off the elevator, I reached over and took her hand. "Let's get our things," I said. Once we were in my car, I began kissing her. She let her hand drop and let me slip my finger under the skirt of her business dress. I took my hand away.</p> <p>"I want you," I said. She didn't say anything. I slid down her panties, taking a good whiff of her wetness. I took her hand, put it to my penis. "It will help," I said. It had to, to help us both. We held each other, moving our hands in small circles in the space that had gone white before we arrived at the restaurant. I broke the kiss and began to play with her nipples. They were already hard. I let my fingers slip lower, between the pussy lips of her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels so good," she sighed in my ear.</p> <p>I ran my fingers around her pussy hole, feeling how wet she was. I brought her hand up and began to kiss her. "I want to watch." I said.</p> <p>I slid my hand up her body, over her breasts, down her smooth stomach to her pussy. She was obviously excited because she began to move her hips.</p> <p>"You can wait," she said, smiling. I pulled of her hand and put my fingers inside her.</p> <p>"Mmm," she said, again looking at the fingers buried in her. I moved her hands to rest on top of mine.</p> <p>"I don't want you to take pictures of us. I'll send them to the internet," I said, but I knew what she was thinking.</p> <p>"Why wouldn't I take pictures of you?" I asked her.</p> <p>"That depends." She said.</p> <p>"On what?" I asked.</p> <p>"On what we're doing to each other," she said.</p> <p>I looked at her. "I thought we'd be going out to dinner, right? That's okay," I said. I began to slide my finger in and out of her.</p> <p>"Would you like to be the driver?" I asked her.</p> <p>She didn't reply. Instead she began to ride my fingers. It felt like a dream as it was me doing this, but she had no idea it would do this to me.</p> <p>"Mmm, that feels so good," I said. I was a bit of a voyeur myself. A woman with her own hand under the table, doing something while another was enjoying her.</p> <p>Her hand went between me and the chair. I put my free hand on your pussy and began to rub her clit. The feeling of your body around me was incredible. I moved my hand up and down along your clit. This was going to be our last timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
