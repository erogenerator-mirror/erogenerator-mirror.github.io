I opened my eyes and watched in amazement as he did this, noticing his hand, or rather the man in the room, moving over my body, moving around in circles, gently cupping my mound. I had to move my left hand from his hair to stroke back and forth against his body. He started moving his hands down my body until they reached the hemline of my skirt. He started in a circular movement, teasing my clitoris with the fingers of one hand as he moved his other down to run his thumb up and down my clitoris.</p> <p>As I felt this I closed my eyes and allowed my mind and body to be taken over by the feelings that were swirling around my body. As I had no particular agenda, I allowed my legs to part slightly, welcoming the caress of this stranger's tongue on my labia. His finger moved down and began to explore my vagina, moving from deep to shallow, and back again. I felt myself start to writhe, and his hand continued to tease, move, excite and tantalise my sex as he continued what he had started earlier. I was not surprised when he pulled slowly and deliberately on my clit, but when he started to massage it again I felt a shudder of pleasure ripple down from my very core. I felt as though my body was on fire, and then, as he gently eased his middle finger into my vagina, causing it to slide in and out, I could feel myself start to throb. The feeling it caused was wonderful. After several minutes of teasing I could feel an incredible sense of closeness to something I had no clue what it was.</p> <p>Then I felt the lips of his mouth on my breast, he was caressing my body with his lips, he gently kissed and nipped every inch of my breasts as his hands slowly ran over my bottom and my legs. I felt the man move away and felt him push his finger deeply inside of me. My vagina felt tighter, hotter and more stretched than anything I had ever felt in my life. My whole body contracted as he started moving his finger in and out, faster, he moved his thumb over my clitoris, causing me to gasp, moan and squirm again. As he removed his finger I could feel my knees weakening and I just hoped that this was just the beginning, that what we had were going to be a magnificent experience. The only thing that mattered was who was fucking me.</p> <p>I looked around the room, to my right the man was kneeling between a woman wearing an almost cat like outfit that exposed her body, but her legs were wide and he was moving very slowly, just enjoying the sensations that were radiating from her soft, smooth skin. I felt his tongue run along my thigh, and his hands were moving slowly, but I knew what was to come and just couldn't wait for it. I felt my eyes drop to the man between my legs, and I watched as his dark hair fell back behind him, as he moved his tongue over my clitoris, he could taste my juices, and as his tongue slid from my pussy up to my clitoris he could taste my sex more strongly. He started to lick the whole of my legs from ankle to my bum. The first taste was great, and as soon as the lips kissed my cunt he knew I was ready to experience an orgasm, I felt him move his tongue out long enough to taste my juices before it returned to my clit. As the first waves of pleasure washed over me he moved his tongue up my clitoris again, and then back down, he moved his hands up my stomach and along my thighs until I felt the warm wet sensation of his tongue running from my vagina back to my clit. The sensation of his tongue had brought me to the peak of passion and this time could only be described as overwhelming, but at the same time it was as great pain as if he had hurt me. But I was close; and with a cry I opened my eyes and watched as my body shook and arched.</p> <p>I was panting and gasping, feeling the tremors run through my body as wave after wave of orgasmic pleasure came over me. The man, who had been watching my orgasm, stood up, pulled his clothes completely off and walked over to the couch. He sat down and watched asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
