Sasha felt self conscious standing with her panties in her hand, but then, realizing that she liked what she saw.</p> <p>"Sasha... I've wanted to see that." He told her.</p> <p>"I've wanted to see you too." She told him, feeling her cheeks starting to burn and her heart start to quiver. "Let me get them off. I'll tell you what to do."</p> <p>With that he got out of bed and handed her a pillow, then sat naked in the armchair with his head resting on the desk. She could sense that he was still aroused, and that he had probably masturbated himself as he watched her walk away.</p> <p>Sasha tried to get off the bed, but the moment she got off it, one of his knees went between her legs and he lifted her a bit higher. Sasha felt the tip of his erect cock rub against her pussy from one side to the other. Even with her panties on, Sasha could still feel the heat of his erection rubbing against her through her thin teddy.</p> <p>Once again, Sasha's skin flushed when she started to move against its own will. She heard him moan, "Yeah, like that, sweetheart." Then he was sliding the tip of the cock into her and she couldn't stop herself from moaning loudly. "That feels so good."</p> <p>It was the first words that Sasha said since she finally got on the bed with Sasha. Not the least bit timid today, Sasha thought.</p> <p>In the next few seconds, Sasha felt his cock throbbing and then suddenly he was coming. The warm liquid that ran out of her pussy onto her leg almost caused her to explode with pleasure.</p> <p>Sasha heard him moan as he finished his climax. Then she heard a noise in her ear.</p> <p>It was the door open that she had no way of knowing. A little light went off, but then stopped, and Sasha was forced to follow the noise.</p> <p>"What is it that a man does to help a woman?" Sasha yelled. "Can a man help a woman make a woman feel good?"</p> <p>Sasha heard him talking with a male voice.</p> <p>"That's a man she wants to be with." It was the male voice. "Are you a man and/or a woman?"</p> <p>Sasha heard him ask "Are you a woman?"</p> <p>"Oh yes! I can make a woman feel good!" Sasha responded.</p> <p>"Are you a woman?" The woman asked again.</p> <p>Sasha's face was ashen. "No I'm not a woman!" Sasha protested furiously. "You're such a prude! I don't really know anything about sex!"</p> <p>"Is that a problem? I'll never hear from you again." The man answered her with a calm voice.</p> <p>"No! What about David?" Sasha protested once again. "... I mean, are I a woman?"</p> <p>"He's your boyfriend." The woman told her. "Can't you see that?" Sasha asked, but her own voice was quiet.</p> <p>"What do you mean? He's your boyfriend..." Sasha protested. She felt as though he was speaking to her, and she couldn't seem to think of a way to even say the words he was saying.</p> <p>Sasha felt a hand grab her from the back. "I didn't say 'David's' a man." It was the male voice. "So you can make a woman feel good."</p> <p>Sasha started to cry. "Please don't hurt me." She begged before she really got any of it.</p> <p>"No, no." The man was saying. "I'm sorry. I'll do anything to stop you from making her feel good."</p> <p>Sasha felt a wave of relief rush over her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry sweetheart." The man said softly. "But I like it when a man plays with my woman, you see."</p> <p>Sasha's eyes widened.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I see." The man responded before Sasha could respond. "You may not be a woman yet, but you're sure going to make a real woman feel good."</p> <p>Sasha heard the man say, "You can't do this at the office." Now she felt that she had to.</p> <p>The man was silent for a moment, then "I know that. But I can't help it if you feel like you're missing out too.
