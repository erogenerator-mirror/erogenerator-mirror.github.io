I asked, knowing his answer.</p> <p>Steve looked at me, and then over to the table next to the bed in front of me.</p> <p>He paused for a moment, and then said, 'Go ahead'.</p> <p>I hesitated for a moment, trying to fight the feelings. He was right. The pain was fading now, a bit of pleasure was returning, the desire to use the device again was back, stronger this time. This was my fantasy.</p> <p>I felt Steve's hand touch my leg, lightly brushing my inner thigh with the tips of three fingers. I wanted him to touch me again, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk that. I don't know how much that realization made a difference, but for now, it helped me to relax.</p> <p>I felt the first thing that went off in me was Steve's lips pressing against my ear as he whispered to me. I relaxed against him more, turning so he could kiss me just a bit more. It wasn't anything like the one time he sucked my nipple, but it was still fun. My nipple was hard, so he rubbed my breasts with one hand, the other rubbed my pussy in slow, circular movements.</p> <p>With the first half hour of our relationship off, there was just a light buzz, that made everything seem more sensuous.</p> <p>I turned on my side, sliding my hand down Steve's side to his stomach and between his muscular legs. I ran my fingers up and down his leg, brushing his balls, which were already tight. As we kissed, my hand moved further up his stomach, finding the little patch of hair just beneath his navel.</p> <p>Steve started thrusting his hips against the soft, hard contact as I ran my finger between his lips and around the ridge there. My other hand was on his chest, holding him close, as we kissed. I brought my finger in a slight circle around his nipple, pressing slightly.</p> <p>I was starting to feel the excitement of the last hour, as our bodies were making love against each other for the last time. My nipples were rock hard and I could feel the bumps and ridges in his chest as they pressed against me as we kissed. I moved my hand upwards in slow, lazy circles around his navel, my fingers brushing the top of his hard cock, pushing my fingers through the hair there.</p> <p>Steve thrust one knee between my thighs, opening himself to me in that soft and gentle way. He leaned over me and held me, his lips seeking mine, his fingers running through my hair. I felt the warmth of his body as he lay down against mine.</p> <p>I held him close again for a few minutes as we continued to kiss as one. I was still trembling with excitement as he started to move his hips again.</p> <p>Then it happened. It was like I had never felt before. My muscles were tight around him and after a few minutes, we both felt the tension release, as he thrust against me one last time and I felt the warm, slippery fluid of our love flow into his mouth.</p> <p>We lay there holding one another. I felt like he had somehow just come into my life and he just rested against me.</p> <p>At some point, my breathing began to pick up again, but Steve put his arm over my shoulders and kissed me lightly.</p> <p>'I love you.'</p> <p>‘I love you too', I replied, but I was sure he didn't mean it.</p> <p>We kissed again.</p> <p>'How'd it feel to just get your body wrapped around me?'</p> <p>'It was amazing to be with you like this'.</p> <p>'Me too' he said.</p> <p>'Just like this?'</p> <p>'Oh yeah. It was really so romantic'</p> <p>'Well good. You are too...'</p> <p>The idea that we would just make love was beginning to arouse me. I just wanted to hug him once more. I don't know how long we lay there like that, but eventually, Steve slipped away as well. 'Whew', he said to me, kissing my lips softly.</p> <p>'Did you like that, or did you want to do it again?' I asked hopefully.</p> <p>Steve rolled onto his side, looking at me.</p> <p>'It might be better if you got dressed first', he said mischievously. 'You do have better breasts, don't you? I don't think I'll be able to keep them up again'</p> <p>I laughed. 'It's not your fault,' I said. 'I did say that you had a good sized chest. I mean, that was a compliment.'</p> <p>He rolled back over, facing me as we were.</p> <p>‘But not a mistake for you'.</p> <p>He kissed me again then. This time, it went a little longer, maybe—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
