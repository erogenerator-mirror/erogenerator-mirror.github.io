The first time I saw you my heart was racing," he continued.</p> <p>"What? What are you talking about?" I asked, taking a sip of the wine.</p> <p>"What would you have done without my encouragement?"</p> <p>I laughed. "That doesn't include saying no, is it?"</p> <p>"Why not? Your answer is obvious," he answered, as he took another sip.</p> <p>"Well, what do you think? Do you like me as much as I like you?" I asked.</p> <p>David smiled and replied, "You're gorgeous and I can't imagine a nicer compliment. I just need to have a few glasses of wine."</p> <p>This time, it was my turn to take a sip of wine. "I'm flattered David."</p> <p>"You're very open and honest," he said.</p> <p>"I'm sure."</p> <p>"So how come you're sitting so close to you like that?" David asked. "You're right that you're beautiful and you look as beautiful as I imagined. Why do you look so sad?"</p> <p>"I do know it." I replied. "I guess that's the thing. I'm always going around in front of you and trying to read your mind."</p> <p>"What kind of a book is that? I really wish there was someone with you. My mind starts running and then my eyes turn to the book." he said.</p> <p>"I'm really starting to feel the heat coming from your eyes and that's only turning me on even more. I can't believe what I'm doing. Maybe you should be able to read someone else's mind?"</p> <p>"Why don't you put some bookmarks in each of the bookcases in the room so we can see who we can talk about," he suggested.</p> <p>"That would be perfect. I'm really getting horny," I told him. As I placed the glass on the table, he took the glass I was carrying and replaced it.</p> <p>"I'm going back for another glass of wine to keep myself under control," I said.</p> <p>"Why don't you bring a chair over there?" he said as he sat down. "There should be plenty of room."</p> <p>"I've always liked the view over the top of your head. It's amazing," I replied.</p> <p>"Good. Here you go." With that, he handed me my glass and returned to the front of the room.</p> <p>I was shocked that all of the candles were glowing a little brighter than they were before I began to enjoy the candles. I didn't have to work the lighting to feel the heat coming off of them. The candles were burning a lot quicker than they were before. I felt lightheaded and I became completely out of control.</p> <p>David sat very still, as if he was holding his breath. He was sitting in my arms, not saying a word. I let go of a few inches off of his lap to see what he was doing. My god, I thought again. How did my heart do that? When did my heart have power? I couldn't move an inch.</p> <p>In less than ten seconds, I could feel David's eyes on me. I thought I can still see his face. I started to move closer to him but he stopped me cold.</p> <p>"It's okay. You're not here for me," he said.</p> <p>I was in awe of how beautiful the man in front of me was. His face was almost angelic in its beauty. He looked like a giant angel. I felt my breath catch in my throat as he put his arms around me and leaned down to kiss me. I felt my mouth fall to his and for the first time, I allowed myself to be kissed and not only allowed my heart to feel warm. I wanted more. I had to feel his hands on me, feeling as much of me as I wanted.</p> <p>"David, you're not the only one who's been giving yourself to someone," I said as I pushed my tongue into his mouth. "How about we try to please each other, and then maybe make love?"</p> <p>"I'm sure you have," he said as he sat up. I moved so that I was right in front of him. I grabbed his hand and pulled him to me. He was on his knees next to me on his hands and knees, with his head in front of mine. "I've wanted this for so long."</p> <p>In the soft lighting of those candles, it took a few moments to get my eyes to adjust to the glare in the room. David never went very soft. As soon as I felt a hand grab my thigh, I realized it wasn't my own. It was another man.
