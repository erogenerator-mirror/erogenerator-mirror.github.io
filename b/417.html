I couldn't take my eyes off of it for it seemed so big, so perfect. I wanted to touch it but I felt so nervous that I couldn't get away. He reached out and ran the palm of his hand over my nipple, lightly squeezing it between his thumb and finger. I felt myself getting weak in the knees and my pussy was contracting on his finger. He leaned in and sucked one of my nipples into his mouth and ran his tongue over it and I felt the warmth of his tongue on my breast. I shuddered, wanting his lips and his mouth on my skin, so I grabbed his hand and placed it onto my other breast. I groaned, hoping he would do that to both of me.</p> <p>He looked up at me and took my hand and placed it on the bulge in his boxers. I squeezed his throbbing cock gently and then moved my hand further down, his balls resting on my wrist. I felt him tense up and then heard a soft moan, then I felt him move my hand down, his thighs. I felt the skin on my fingers as it moved closer and closer to his cock and then gently ran just the head of my finger up and down the length of it, feeling the pre-come on it as it slid up and down on my finger. He moved closer and closer to me and his hard cock was pressing against my inner thigh which was pressed up against my pussy and then I heard him gasp as my fingers touched his balls, then run up and down, his balls and the head of his cock.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," he whispered, taking my hand that was on his cock and leading me to the bed. He laid me down on my back, pulled his boxers off and lay next to me on my stomach. His mouth was on my breast and I felt his soft hands running down my body, over my belly, across my mound, stroking me gently all the way to my pussy. He slid a finger along my soaking wet lips and then slipped under my clit hood to run his finger over my clit. I trembled with desire as his finger moved over me and inside me and I was sure he could feel me as tight as a virgin. I pulled to my side for air, feeling that I was naked as men's bodies. He lay down beside me, gently running his hand down over my stomach and onto my mound, feeling it, spreading my lips as he moved his finger up and down over my clit. My clit was hard again as he touched it, running his finger up and down it and I heard him gasp slightly. I ran my finger down over my nipple again, feeling it get hard on his hand, feeling it getting wet on my finger. I felt my breath quicken as he felt me, moving her hips to feel me, feeling the soft warmth of my mound as it moved. I wanted him to move his finger so badly that I could feel him moving. I heard him gasp as I moved my finger back to my clit, feeling my wetness as she slid down onto him until I could feel him in my throat. Then he moved his hand back down to my pussy and his middle finger sliding deep inside me as I pulled his head in tight, needing more. As he fingered me I thought I could feel his lips around my nipple. He started sucking harder, going in and out, moving his hand up and down over my clit. I gasped as that felt so good, the sensation of having his tongue lapping at me and his finger inside me just a little more.</p> <p>"Oh shit, oh my god," I gasped, his pace quicken as I felt my orgasm building. I felt him slide his finger out from between my lips and into his mouth, my juices running down his finger, his breath hot against my clit.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said, kissing my stomach, moving his mouth down my body, licking and touching all over me. His soft lips moved over my mound and my breath caught in my throat as he kissed the outside of my lips, teasing them apart and then pressing my mound right up against his lips. I tried to lean back but he held me in place.</p> <p>"N-n-n-not," I said, reaching out and pushing his head down to me. I felt his head as he parted my lips, then his tongue sliding up into my dripping pussy. His arms went around me, pulling me back against him as he went in deeper with his tongue. I gasped my appreciation for the feeling of his lips on my pussy. He moved from my lips and onto my stomach, my body moving up and down as his lips caressed my legs, the way he was kneeling by them. I felt his weight on me and knew that he was going to slide himself up my body toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
