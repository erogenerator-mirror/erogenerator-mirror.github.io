That’s right, she did. You do too.” Josh said as he laughed at his own joke. He was also pretty proud of himself, and he couldn’t wait to see his girlfriend on the stage in a bikini in front of everyone.</p> <p>“So, I guess we have a problem then.” Josh spoke. I knew he was kidding.</p> <p>“I guess so. What do you mean?”</p> <p>I could almost read the thoughts running through his mind.</p> <p>“Well, you know, I really want you to go to college, if you like.” Josh started.</p> <p>I heard the tone of his voice change, but it all seemed to settle out of his control. It was like he was holding himself back. He stopped talking and looked at me. He then leaned his hands over his head and started watching the dance floor and the dance floor at the same time.</p> <p>“You really want to go to college, don’t you? You think it's a risk, don’t you?” Josh said as he laughed.</p> <p>“Yeah, I really do. I know I would want to get my degree, but I’m just not really sure.” I said. “I mean, you want to and it’s only fair I do. I mean I’d be willing to do anything to be with you.”</p> <p>“You know, it doesn’t have to be a risk. It’s just a kind of chance, isn’t it?” Josh said.</p> <p>“Ok. If we stay out here much longer, would you be willing to help me?” I questioned him.</p> <p>“I was thinking the same thing.” Josh said after a few moments. He took one step back and then sat on the stool next to me. “You know, there were those things we did, and even though the idea is a little scary, I think we’ll have the experience to do it again.”</p> <p>I was surprised by how good his mind was making him sound. It was like he wanted to come on to me, but didn’t come on to me. It didn’t help that it seemed like it was a fantasy, that way. I thought about it.</p> <p>“I’m sure you would like to. You’re obviously excited about it and don’t want it to end.” Josh said as though surprised to hear it.</p> <p>“Yeah, the things I saw you do made me want to do them even more. But I don’t know if it would be a good idea.” I said. That made him laugh a little.</p> <p>“Yeah, it would bother me too, but I think that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want to do it.” Josh said quietly.</p> <p>I smiled. “I understand about that, but I just don’t want to risk it. It’s not like I said that I would always force you. I’m telling you that I’m not going to force you, if you don’t ask me anyway.” I said.</p> <p>He smiled then. We were talking, but I could feel him looking me up and down. His eyes were intense. His skin was the colour of emeralds and his hair and beard looked so nice. I felt my pussy getting wet just seeing him just looking at me.</p> <p>“Ok, if it’s ok with you.” Josh said quickly. “That’s cool with me.”</p> <p>“Yeah, right with me.” It came out in a rush that I couldn’t quite say, but I could still make it. It wasn’t as sudden and as painful. My whole body felt alive and I was really excited right now. I hadn’t even considered the possibility of having an orgasm just once! When I looked at him I could see the lust in his eyes. I think he felt the same way as well.</p> <p>Josh sat there smiling as he watched my chest move in small circles. We were both thinking the same thing.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>We were on the way to my university and I was going to be going with him, so Josh didn’t have to leave. The way he looked at me made me feel like a slut and I was actually thinking about that. He was really making me feel pretty.</p> <p>After a few minutes of talking to each other, a few—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
