The fact that you’re being fucked by their friend may be a good excuse to go get dressed and go pick up their daughter.” He stated.</p> <p>“Oh, I’m sorry you feel that way.” I responded.</p> <p>He reached up and wiped the droplets from his eyes with his finger and said.</p> <p>“Now then there’s that question…Do what you want to do. I’ll only agree to the best of their minds if you help them with any problem.” he replied.</p> <p>He leaned over took my nipple in both hands and squeezed gently. I winced at the cold touch; I needed to feel the touch of his warm body on my naked flesh. He leaned back and stared at me with a huge satisfied smile. I smiled back and asked him to continue. I leaned down and kissed his shoulder, as I reached to his pants…I could feel his throb as my wet lips brushed it. I could hear his breathing start to increase. He leaned back and began to slide his hand down my body. He could feel my nipples becoming hard and pointed, as he ran the index and ring fingers over my swollen clit. He could feel my legs tense up and my body quiver. I pushed his hand away again and I looked at him with a worried expression.</p> <p>“I want to play this out so that we can have a fun time together.” I exclaimed.</p> <p>He reached over and kissed my lips and said, “What are you talking about Katie?”</p> <p>I smiled and said, “I’m sorry.”</p> <p>“There's no need to be sorry either. I don’t mind at all. I like what you do to me, you seem to enjoy it too.” He laughed…it was almost scary how much this turned me on.</p> <p>We started to pull up into his driveway and he said, “No. Let’s not rush it. I have a lot of time and you just gave me an opportunity. Just enjoy the feeling of being with someone else for once. I’ll drive and we can go.”</p> <p>I smiled and said, “OK. I really don’t mind. I think we can get out of here and I’ll just follow you to the bed.”</p> <p>I led him by the hand into his home and we quickly disrobed.” It’s not easy to leave the lights on but that’s what they’re here for. They’re only for us once it happens.” He pointed to the large screen TV. “The next time you see it you will know who is being fucked by whom.”</p> <p>“OK.” I smiled. I watched as John got down on his knees in front of the beautiful naked man kneeling at his feet. I could feel the juices start to leak from me as he ran his finger across my wet cunt. He ran his finger up and down my cunt coating it with my juices. He reached into my pussy and scooped out some of my wetness. He pushed his finger into my cunt and brought it up to his mouth and he sucked it before allowing it to fall to the side to join the others that were already there. He turned off the TV, turned to the large sofa and then he pulled the chair up.</p> <p>I sat before him on the sofa as he sat next to me. I watched as he pulled down his pants and boxers. He had not touched his erection, not even for a minute. I saw his cock spring into view. It must have been nine inches of perfectly formed steel. John turned his head slightly so he could look at me as he moved up between my legs. He leaned toward me and placed his left hand on my left thigh. His right hand was holding my right leg over his left. He moved his face to mine and kissed me passionately. He wrapped his arms around my upper body and pulled me to him. His left hand held my leg up high, and his right hand was stroking my right thigh.</p> <p>“I’m going to fuck you. Oh God. I can’t wait for it.” He cried out.</p> <p>He placed his right hand on the top of my thigh as though he was trying to get me aroused. He had already opened a pair of jeans and he had already worked his hand into the leg of my shorts. I reached under his shirt to feel the soft hair that lay on his chest. His back was arched and his head was thrown back, as he kissed me. We were pressed together tightly. He leaned back. My right thigh was spread open, which allowed his hand to move—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
