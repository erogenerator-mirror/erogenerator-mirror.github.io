"We've gotta go."</p> <p>When we had left the bar, we had stopped at a Mexican place. It was nice, and I liked it. It had a large patio with a large hot tub at one end: I'd bought a place for it when I was still at work: I loved it.</p> <p>"Where are we going?"</p> <p>"I brought you my house."</p> <p>"How do you know?"</p> <p>"Because...because you're mine..." I smiled; I felt her tongue on my cheek, "and you're not even going to need a drink for that, are you?"</p> <p>We spent the next twenty minutes in my living room; we'd spent three years going out and the occasional carpool date, I'd been too shy to take her out for a walk in the park. Once, I'd taken her back to her home, to my house, and I'd watched her grow in her new manor. Her legs wrapped around me, and her pussy came once and then again.</p> <p>"So what are we gonna do about it?" I asked, looking around at the open house, just looking at the pool and the hot beach.</p> <p>"I don't know," She said with a shrug, "I'm not sure I want to take this any further, but...we...are, aren't we?" I felt I did.</p> <p>"Well, okay," I smiled at her, "I'm not doing anything with a guy...that's up to you." I smiled again, enjoying her body.</p> <p>"What are we getting into next?" She smiled.</p> <p>"Well, I told you...but...I don't know..."</p> <p>"I know," she shrugged and looked at me, "...but we can't." She smiled again, "we've gotta do something."</p> <p>She pulled me close and put her arms around me, "Why do we have to stay married? I don't want to change it, okay?"</p> <p>"That's what...that's what I'm scared of," I said, "If it gets the wrong idea."</p> <p>"Well, don't worry," she said. "I'm not gonna change it. You're not gonna...never mind."</p> <p>As the next morning was our first official day together, we'd left the bar pretty early, we walked the streets toward my house and it was just a short walk to the front door. We'd had sex before I got to the house, but it was usually just for kicks. We walked through the front door, got in my car and sat under the umbrella on my porch.</p> <p>"I don't want to change it," she said, "I just want to get back inside."</p> <p>"Me neither, sweetheart."</p> <p>"You just want to get to know me, okay? I know you were feeling guilty about last night, but I was feeling guilty too. I wanted you to fuck me, too, so now you're all outta your mind and I don't want to lose you."</p> <p>I smiled at her; I know she loved me, and she loved me. "I'll try not to, sweet one."</p> <p>The sun just slipped through the curtains. The warm fall breeze tickled me. She slipped the robe from her shoulders, let it tangle to the ground. She looked like she'd just gotten out of bed.</p> <p>"You don't have to leave," she said. "We both knew you could stay."</p> <p>"Of course we do," I said, "I just...I can't."</p> <p>She looked a little concerned but kept on. "You could stay, too..." Her voice just drifted, and she put her arms around me, "and we'll both be happy."</p> <p>"I don't think we should do that," I said, and I was starting to wonder why we were not doing that already. We knew we weren't getting anywhere, we both had too damned long to spend time here when we were ready to leave, but neither of us had time for anything further.</p> <p>"Why not?" she smiled at me, "That can be fun sometimes."</p> <p>I felt a little sad but happy.</p> <p>"I just...I don't know what to say," I said, "I'm happy you're both in love and together."</p> <p>We got out the house and walked the street, and we went across the park. We went for a swim in the hot tub. By the time we got back to the house, the sun had come outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
