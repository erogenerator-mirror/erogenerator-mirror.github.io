You can use the shower and I'll wash you off too. Okay?"</p> <p>"That's fine."</p> <p>She moved closer and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"You're not getting dressed are you?"</p> <p>"No," I told her with a small smile on my face. "Just go ahead and get dressed and come down."</p> <p>She shook her head. "You're such a baby," she said.</p> <p>I looked back at my handiwork.</p> <p>"What a job!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"Yeah! It's only a short time in the kitchen for me to get undressed. That's pretty much every day."</p> <p>"Why?" I asked feeling uncomfortable.</p> <p>"I'm trying so hard to get out of my mind that I can't just be so casual around you. I can't even think about how you're going to get to this table," she said with a grin.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because they have to come down to the water."</p> <p>"The water?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "The room's just below the pool. We'll take a short swim to keep it from going dark."</p> <p>I had to agree. We went down to the water and swam around for a few minutes, enjoying the sun.</p> <p>"See?" She asked as we splashed against each other.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's exactly where I expected it," I said. "But then I thought of the pool."</p> <p>"Oh, right. It must be very secluded around here."</p> <p>"No. It's definitely secluded."</p> <p>"Don't worry. It feels secluded."</p> <p>"You're so nice. It's like the first time."</p> <p>The kiss turned to one of affection. I held her tight against me.</p> <p>"How much do you want me, Angel?" I asked.</p> <p>"We'd better hurry though," she said as she grabbed my cock. "You're not getting dressed and I'm getting undressed in the bathroom as fast as we can."</p> <p>As she looked in my eyes, she ran her fingers lightly along my collarbone. Her fingernails dug into the small of my back.</p> <p>"Well," she said. "I'm getting undressed too."</p> <p>"You're right," I said and then realized that she wanted to make me naked. She reached up and grabbed my hands from behind me. I let her hold me as she led me upstairs towards the master bedroom. Once inside, she pulled the covers up so that just the tops were off the bed and pushed me onto them. She climbed on top of me and slid my cock inside her. We kissed passionately as my hands explored every inch of her back.</p> <p>"You feel so good," I said.</p> <p>"Mm, just keep saying that. It feels so good," she responded as she wrapped her legs around me. I wrapped my arms around her and felt the wonderful softness of her skin. Her breathing became heavier and her breasts quivered against me. I took her nipple between my lips one last time and she let out a sharp gasp.</p> <p>"Oh, baby. That felt so good," she said. My hips moved towards hers as if to thrust her body against me more strongly. It didn't take long before I felt her begin to tense. Moments later, she wrapped her arms around me and kissed me.</p> <p>"Now we're even," she said as she squeezed me in return. I reached down and began to tickle her outer lips, making her breathe even harder. She squirted water around the base of my cock and began to moan. As I found her clitoris with my thumb, she reached down and began to rub it.</p> <p>"You want me to do some really naughty things," she said and then asked, "Do you want to do me a favor?"</p> <p>I nodded in response as my thumbs found their way up and down her wet slit.</p> <p>"You think you can cum with that?" she asked.</p> <p>"I think I can," I said and then added, "You can do me any way you like if you let me cum without your having to stop."</p> <p>"Oh, yes. The whole deal's off now," she said. She slowly lowered herself onto me, her muscles clenching around me. I heard the sounds of my cum seeping down my balls as well.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>We had spent the day laying in bed together, watching some TV at dinner, trying to find something to do while we were alone.
