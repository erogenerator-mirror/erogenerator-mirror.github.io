I’m with you,”</p> <p>I started to pull away when I felt her hand on my ass pulling me back. I slid over and lay down. She grabbed the top of my head and pushed it toward her and I opened my eyes. I felt my mouth getting hot as she sucked my neck and worked her way up to my ears. I could feel her hands rubbing my body and chest and stomach all over and I relaxed. As soft and soft as she was, she was so much more than that as she was much more than me. She was gentle as she reached my lips and pulled back. My lips fell open and we kissed deep and passionately. I felt her tongue slowly dancing under my lips and my body melted as it found it’s own sexual nature. It came from heaven. As her tongue danced around mine, my own tongue darted out to probe her depths, seeking her tongue and tasting her.</p> <p>Her wet fingers rubbed my nipples and pulled them gently up and down the skin, sending shivers through my body. I felt the heat between us growing by the second. She moved her chest to my body and began circling my nipples between her fingers. She began squeezing them firmly but gently as she felt a change start in my body. I groaned as she rolled her fingers around my nipple and started rubbing between my outer pussy lips until I felt it growing and the heat of my pussy rising. She began pulling the lips open and felt her wetness seeping from inside. Her mouth fell on my nipples now and sucked and lightly bit them. My legs parted and her tongue slid over my clitty. It felt so good and so very exciting to feel my body responding. My hands explored and pulled at her body. My legs parted and closed and started stroking my pussy. The sensations were so intense and intense and so wonderful I felt myself cum. My body tensed as the wave receded. It was more than I had ever felt and I was ready to return the favor. I slid my arms under her arms and up her sides to her shoulders as she lowered herself down, and started tonguing my thighs. I moaned as my body relaxed and my legs opened wider for her.</p> <p>I felt her tongue move closer to my ass and run up my cheeks. There she kissed the cheeks and worked her tongue even deeper in me. In my mind, I was in a dream come true as she began taking her face away from my ass. It was the best sex I had ever had. My body began to shake as she kissed my body and stroked my skin. I could feel that it was going to end as she moved back up to her knees. It was then I began to get to sleep. I was never quite satisfied. The thought of what had happened that evening never left as if the reality of our relationship had been. I fell asleep in front of the mirror and dreamed of the beautiful woman standing before me, naked with a beautiful smile. I wanted to hold her and kiss her but it was no use. The next thing I knew, I had passed out from the lack of sleep. It was sometime after midnight. I awoke. I looked around me and there was the figure dressed only in her robe. The look was one I was familiar with. We had shared one of our many erotic conversations and had gotten together with many of our own fantasies. I rolled out of bed, slipped into my robe and went into my room. I stripped off my sleepwear and stood, looking at her in her nightgown. I ran my hands up my thighs, over my stomach, and slowly slid my right hand between my legs, over my clit. I felt it start to rise and spread open at my touch. I watched as her body writhed, her breasts rose above her robe.</p> <p>I had not had sex that night. It had all happened so slowly. I had spent the day looking at porn. I had spent more time at her work and had sex with more than my fair share. I was amazed at the variety and excitement of what I was seeing. She had spent time over at my home looking for my fantasy and then found one and had been able to have it with her and had been very willing when I had told her to have sex with me.</p> <p>I wanted to take her there. I wanted to see her. I wanted to show her how a woman could be loved. I wanted to make love to her. I wanted to take her until she was tired and then take her home. I had been thinking about her all day and just now got up to do my shopping. I made coffee and went to the living room to watch TV. I got into bed, but my heart told me to go back to sleep. I heard her come in and then go to change. It was then I heard her on the phone.</p> <p>�—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
