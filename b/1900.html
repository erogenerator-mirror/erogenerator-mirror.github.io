I reached over and put my hand on her shoulder.</p> <p>"It's ok. I told you that it will go away."</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "So long as they stop being friends now we're through, is that it?"</p> <p>"It's fine. So if someone asks I'll tell them what we do," I said taking her right hand and putting her hand back on her shoulder. "Well, have you ever done that? Are you sure you don't want to do that sometime?"</p> <p>"No, it's something I've thought about doing but never had the courage to do it with someone close to me," she answered. "This looks just how I like it."</p> <p>"Ok, I don't think that I'm ready to talk about it just yet."</p> <p>"Nonsense. It's your call," she said. "You've just waited too long."</p> <p>So here's what she did. She undid her bra and pulled it over her head. It took me a few seconds to get my dick away from its prison before she covered it with her bra again. She slid her panties off, so that they landed face down on the floor and started rubbing her pussy in front of me.</p> <p>She spread her legs again and reached up under the bottom of her nighty to caress her breasts. She had an odd expression on her face which I guess was that she was ready to go back to the party. She gave her pussy a big kiss and then reached down for me to pull me out of the chair by my pants. This was the very moment again when she had the audacity to pull my underwear down and expose my dick. I have always wondered how she really felt about this. Here it was, the moment that she had been waiting for.</p> <p>My pants came down with her panties and she pushed me down onto the bed with her. She crawled over me and started to kiss me again. She started to get me aroused, but when we began to make out, it was more of an experience then of just making out. She was making out with the other girl as they caressed each other on the couch. She kissed down my neck and over to my right breast and sucked my nipple. The feeling was sensational.</p> <p>I put my hand on her head and could feel her breath through the thin fabric of her nighty. She knew exactly what she was doing because it only added to the excitement I was feeling and I began to rub her hips around to get my dick out of her panties. I felt her move back down to the waistband of my briefs and feel how she was working me out.</p> <p>She moved her head off me to the outside of my briefs and then kissed below the waistband. She pulled off my briefs and exposed my dick as she had done before. This time she used both hands to pull me out as far as she thought she could and the feeling was incredible. I had both of her breasts in my hands now and they were moving back and forth. As she continued rubbing her pussy up and down the shaft she was moving a little, sliding up and down. I could feel her nipples getting harder and felt her pussy juice dripping all over me again.</p> <p>And that's when I looked for something.</p> <p>I looked across into the room at the chair in the corner where I was sitting in it. The action had made me somewhat uncomfortable since I had an erection and the sight of her lying on her back on the other sofa made it harder to look. I turned and looked at the chair next to me until I found what I was looking for. I turned it again and looked in at her. She was smiling and rubbing herself on my leg and looking at me intently now. I felt her warm breath on down there. "Mmm, I like the taste of you. I think I can do this every time," she said.</p> <p>She spread her legs as far as she could and began to run her finger across the lips of her pussy. I could see them wet through a thin layer of hair. "Do that with me," she said. "I like it."</p> <p>I slid down until my mouth was by her feet. I looked at her and she was staring in my eyes with a look like a kid at Christmas. And I took her foot in my mouth. I could hear the wetness as well as feel the heat as it spread on my mouth. I ran my tongue across her heel and then sucked on her toes. She began to run her fingers through my hair which I kept with my mouth. We both liked that so much that we both wanted more. Her pussy was a little too tight for me to sit on it so I slid back and up along her thigh. The feel of her warm wet sex caused me to get wet again.</p> <p>I lookedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
