He stayed. A big strong man with a deep voice. He looked after me like that, keeping me safe. He told me not to go to bed, and that I could. It was not love... It was sex... I didn't understand what he was saying but I knew it was true. I told him how hard I had masturbated every night. He seemed pleased when I told him I could, but then he didn't say yes. We were at a stage. We were to have sex, but not before I came. But he hadn't asked. He didn't want to take no for an answer.</p> <p>I felt a sharp sting to my ass as his hand slapped me harder than anyone had ever slapped me before. I screamed again but this time it was in frustration, not pain. He stopped suddenly, pushing his weight onto me. He was so forceful that I thought he had just struck my bottom. He didn't want to give me my punishment. I had been very open and honest with him and he knew I knew the rules before he said them. He didn't say a word, however, he didn't remove his weight.</p> <p>"So... do you really want to do it like this, my dear?"</p> <p>I didn't answer right away. I stared into his dark eyes once again, wondering what he was going to say next. However, I didn't see his finger sliding down my slit or his cock penetrating me. I hadn't thought it possible. This whole situation was not as I'd imagined... but it was. And it was just as I had thought it would be. I knew when it was really happening. It seemed to just happen so often because I was a nervous woman, but it was real. I never got this excited, though, as I thought it would last a long time. It had taken me so long to learn how to enjoy this with others... It felt like a very long time, but it didn't.</p> <p>"Yes, I want to do it. I want you to have a climax. I want you to take my lover. I want us to make love. I want to have a baby inside of you."</p> <p>He told me to hold it in... that he would tell the doctor. He told me to be on top because of the danger. He would tell the doctor that I was on birth control for the moment, but to be safe. He told me not to cum, that I would just be his toy and take it when he wanted. I didn't answer. I didn't know for sure. But he didn't take no for an answer and I was so fearful of him. I heard a zipper and then my skin was being removed by my own hand and I felt his hard cock filling me up and then being shoved into me. He began to slowly thrust it in and out of me a little, but I was so afraid of any sound. In my mind I envisioned a room full of doctors in black, and he wouldn't have cared if they were on a ward on the floor screaming at the guard in Arabic. As he thrust faster and faster in and out of me, I felt him pushing harder into me. I didn't have to thrust to feel him push to make his thrusts deep.</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Keep doing that... "</p> <p>He wanted to be a doctor?</p> <p>"Yes, yes! I... " but my voice was barely audible.</p> <p>"My... my... my... you want... " He said.</p> <p>I couldn't hold it in any more. When I was finally able to, I began to come inside of him... like none I'd ever been able to do without. Just the feeling of being filled over and over again by him. We were lost in a reverie of love, oblivious to each other. I was naked and he was fully clothed, so we just lay there, as he held me in his arms. He began to massage and stroke my breasts, as he spoke very softly in my ear. Then he was on his back and had the strength to lift me up so I was on top of him. My head was resting on his chest. I was very close to him. I realized I did not want to fall asleep so soon. I wanted him to be ready. I felt his cock begin to move. I looked. I looked for signs from his face... I held his gaze. He was ready.</p> <p>"Do you want to come in me? Yes?"</p> <p>I didn't answer him, but that was what I wanted.</p> <p>"Ask me one word."</p> <p>"Yes," I said.</p> <p>"When did you want to do this?"</p> <p>"When I was in my bed." I took his hands and held them behind him, as he pulled me downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
