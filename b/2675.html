Perhaps it was the sound of the shower that brought me back, just a few feet away. In the back of the closet, I could faintly hear a raucous laugh, and someone's heavy breathing in the shower. Or maybe they had come over here to watch.</p> <p>The door opened just a crack, and I heard a sigh, and the sound of something wet. The sound grew louder. The door flung open wide enough for the man to peer out as well as enter the bathroom. With an eager smile he slipped into the shower stall, closed the door and stepped into the hot water. His eyes were closed and I could see, at his feet, some liquid dripping down over the man's feet. Without warning the water pulsed hot across the man's chest, and the man's hands, which were wrapped firmly in the white towel, began to move up to the man's shoulders. The heat from their bodies intensified, and he closed his eyes, leaning his head back against the wall, and the men kissed each other deeply, sharing what felt like an intimate moment, but was probably just another romp in the arms.</p> <p>The shower came to a stop, and the man stood there. His arms stretched out behind him, his chest arching out a bit. One of his hands wandered down his chest and around the edge of the man's cock, the other hand reaching up to grasp the man's hanging balls.</p> <p>"Oh, that's nice, you guys are sooo nice," the man growled, and pulled the man so he was standing facing the wall, leaning against the wall and thrusting his cock towards the man's face.</p> <p>The men looked into eyes, and, in front of them, I heard what I assumed was a muffled groan. I watched as the man's hand went between the man's legs, stroking his cock, and the man began to moan, clearly enjoying his first handjob from a man since his wife. The man dropped his hands to his side and turned his head to the side, letting the cock slide from his mouth with a wet sucking sound. He seemed close to cumming already.</p> <p>The man moved his cock to the side as he looked at the man. His hand moved to the man's cheek. Still holding his cock, the man turned towards him as the man leaned back into his embrace. The man held out his hands, offering the hand, while still leaning back. I saw they wrapped their hands around each other's hips. The man began guiding the cock between a pair of large breasts as the man kneaded at the man's ass. Then it was gone, and they leaned once more into one another. I heard the men begin to groan, each sigh becoming a groan, as their mouths fell in a soft fit together. I felt my own cock begin to stiffen.</p> <p>The water felt so nice against my skin. I turned my head, and the sound of a woman's voice brought me back to the couple. What time is it? What had I been standing in the doorway? And why did they stay on the other side of the door? Were they kissing? Did they want to fuck? How long had they been standing there? I heard a soft moan. Then I realized it was from the door, and the man stepped up. I could see his hand slipping up his buddy's ass, and he was thrusting back against the hand. I took another breath, and I saw the woman, standing just a few feet away, watching. She didn't even seem to notice as the man began to move his hand in the man's ass.</p> <p>The woman was watching. Her mouth moved towards them, and I saw her kiss, then lick at the penis, which was being held in an almost frantic rhythm by both their hands. She looked like she had done this many times before. They seemed to be getting a great fuck from their hands. The other's hips bucked. They leaned in further towards the wall. The man held onto the hand while he thrust into a woman's pussy. And he pulled it out from her ass, and I could see more of the penis, now dripping with her own juices, sliding into him. I saw the woman's lips cover the cock to the very tip of the organ, and then let go of the man's cock, pulling the penis all the way out of the other man, and then sliding it back in. And then in through the other's ass. And they were all moving, I couldn't make out if the man's hips were thrusting, or if they were both fucking each other. Then their hands were out of view, and they were thrusting in and out, in and out, in and out!</p> <p>I knew that they were loving to fuck, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
