I thought to myself.</p> <p>"I mean, I'm a little worried about something there..."</p> <p>"Oh, you know just take the edge off, sweetheart. I have nothing better on the road than a sexy woman...and it can be fun..."</p> <p>"You're crazy...I can't believe you..."</p> <p>"Shush, sweetie, please. I want you to look at me. It's your turn."</p> <p>I turned my attention back to the road in my mind as I drove further into the wooded area, taking deep breaths, almost as if I was running through some sort of nightmare.</p> <p>"Shall I stop?" I heard a voice outside.</p> <p>My eyes snapped back to reality as the voice was right there with me...and I looked closer.</p> <p>It was the young man who had spoken to me this morning with my face in his lap and his eyes transfixed on my eyes.</p> <p>"You really are looking hot when you're this excited," he said, his voice getting deeper.</p> <p>"Please don't tease me like this," I pleaded.</p> <p>"Do you want to have him inside of you, little girl?" his voice became huskier.</p> <p>"I can't. Please stop! I can't! I won't break in!" I could hear myself pleading again.</p> <p>"It's too late to think of making him stop. There's more to you than I know," he continued. She just didn't seem aware of where my eyes were going.</p> <p>"Hmmm," his voice grew more confident as I watched his hand slip from his lap. He began gently running his hand through my hair again.</p> <p>"There's more," he murmured, his body relaxing and beginning to writhe in his seat. It wasn't a slow seduction. My legs began to tremble as the sensations built inside of me from the erotic experience of being with this young, handsome, very experienced and sexy person.</p> <p>"You're all wet, sweetheart." He said. "How does it feel to have my cock between your thighs?"</p> <p>"I...I don't know..." I managed to say, not really knowing I wanted him inside of me. My body was shuddering when I felt his hand run along my thigh, caressing and squeezing at it. "It's not a bad one, my girl," he continued. "I don't want you to feel so overwhelmed, I promise," he added.</p> <p>He moved his hand down a little further, but never reached my moist folds. His fingers came to rest where his fingers had so carefully spread them to let him find my center and touch himself inside. His fingers stroked and caressed a bit and I began to move my hips towards him, trying to feel the pleasure he would give me. I could feel his cock growing as his excitement grew. He leaned forward, almost pushing his shoulders back against the seat.</p> <p>"Take off your shirt," he said in a deep, husky voice, almost demanding in his tone.</p> <p>I hesitated only long enough to undo the buttons of my shirt and it fell open to my sides. Then he slipped my shirt off my shoulders and dropped to the floor, exposing my breasts to his scrutiny...and, perhaps more importantly, to his touch. I raised my hands for the first time and he took my breasts in his hands as I lowered them back, holding onto them both. He continued to caress my breasts as his fingers traced along my sides, my tummy and finally, my hips. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feeling of his fingers on my body. As he began tracing higher with his fingers, they began to travel back and forth along each leg, tracing my inner thighs.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he whispered, finally moving his face down to just above my vulva. His mouth made contact with my skin and I could feel my pussy becoming warmer as every second ticked by and I felt a desire that my body was dying to find release.</p> <p>With my hands now on his shoulders, he rose back up. With one last glance up at my face, he took both breasts in his hands and began tracing, squeezing and kneading his way down my body as he went. By now, I was breathing heavily and felt almost dizzy. I turned my head and let it drop so that I could see his face as he explored my body.</p> <p>I was surprised to see him gazing at my body with those eyes again.
