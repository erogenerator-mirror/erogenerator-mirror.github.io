Our work nights really paid off and were better than my first few weekends. I really did enjoy our time, and the excitement we got when we were done working on the car. We had a few more beers then went out to dinner. We had our meals so quickly and the sexual tension that had built up in the evening was almost too much. We went to a pub to have a few beers and chatted. The first time we had talked about our feelings for each other the other night I was shocked that she had feelings for me... even now.</p> <p>The conversation was quite intimate - about our jobs, our friends and our sex lives. It was easy to see that she was a sex therapist with a lot about her. We made jokes, laughed, and laughed. This really became a thing from our first meeting. We had agreed that I would take her back for her first time having sex with me. She got all hot and sexy while I played with her breast or fingered her. For once we agreed to let me fuck her and she wanted more. She also wanted to let me stick my tongue into her mouth. Now, I am a big guy - I have to admit, she was a little nervous as she looked around the room - she seemed like she wanted to be in that position.</p> <p>Her curiosity got the better of her. She asked me about work, about my relationship with Karen, so much that we stopped talking about our mutual feelings and moved to the bedroom. We had the sex a lot more that the first time, then she wanted me to fuck her again. We made love, and it had the same effect on me, feeling totally relaxed when I touched her vagina.</p> <p>I was ready for her right at seven. We were just going to lie there naked, with nothing else on. I lay down with her on top of me and slowly moved my shaft into her warm and wet hole. I loved the feel of her breasts pressed against mine - so soft and warm. I was still inside of her as I put my arms around her, kissing on her cheek, neck and chest. I just kept on slowly moving in and out of her. I had already made her cum over my dick - so, she was no longer a virgin.</p> <p>My dick was hard and sticking straight up. I could feel the heat, the slickness as my shaft rubbed up and down her slit. I kissed her again, a little tighter, more passionate as I was kissing her back. I kept slowly moving in and out. I could tell she was getting very excited. I wanted her to feel as good as I made her feel with my dick. I really enjoyed feeling her pussy as it slid up and down on me, then it was like I was sliding up a hot river, and then I could feel water cascading down onto us. I don't think I had cummed in months so there was a lot stored up inside of her.</p> <p>I began moving in and out of her and then she began to grind her crotch into mine. Our dicks were both hard and sticking straight into each other. We both knew we needed to make it last.</p> <p>I kissed her again, then held her tight to me as I felt the rise of her impending orgasm. I let my hands roam over her body all over her. It was all I could do from holding her as my dick rubbed her clit and into her cunt. I could tell she was very close to cumming as she had her face buried in my chest again and her breathing was coming out loudly, panting with pleasure!</p> <p>I was surprised by the amount of excitement that was building in her. She wanted it - she wanted me to cum in her! I knew that that would be the next stage of her sex life. I was about to cum really hard, so I reached up and took several firm handfuls of her long brown hair.</p> <p>"Cum in me," I whispered into her ear as my balls began to spasm in release.</p> <p>"Oh God!" She whispered in my ear, looking up at me with those hypnotizing eyes. Her hand was on my chest, rubbing lightly as she moved back and forth on her hips, almost sitting up and rolling me with her pussy. Her face was buried on mine.</p> <p>I couldn't hold it any longer and I began filling her as I thrust into her again. It was the most intense feeling I had ever felt. I could feel my orgasm coming and she was moving on me even faster. Our bodies were wet and slippery as they moved together, my dick and her crotch. My whole body was tightening up and I was in ecstasy!</p> <p>She stopped moving and was just kissing me as we both tried to get more oxygen to our lungsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
