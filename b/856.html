"I need you here." He pulled both of them up by the shoulders and slammed them into the bedroom with a thump that made her scream into the night. "Come here," he growled, grabbing both of her ankles and dragging her towards the bed and throwing her down at the point her knee hit the glass wall and she fell down onto it. She saw it in his eyes and it was then she realized that he wasn't going to rape her. She would do whatever he wanted at this pace if he would just give it a chance. As she lay there he pushed off the bed and pushed his pants off the rest of the way, making sure they wouldn't be needed. He pushed on his pants and shoes, and then sat on the edge of the bed. He slid both hands up and around her thighs, lifting her left leg and then pushing it up towards his waist.</p> <p>"Oh, Daddy!" she cried, feeling the throbbing between her legs as he lifted her thigh and then pressed it against his cock, making her gasp.</p> <p>"I'm not hurting you, baby," he whispered in her ear. "I want this right before we make love. Trust me." He pushed her leg up higher and then slowly pulled it back so her thigh was against his now bare chest. He reached up and unbuttoned her shirt, slowly moving it down from her shoulders. As he pulled her shirt over her head, she could smell herself on it and she gasped.</p> <p>"Oh," she murmured. It was intoxicating and she couldn't help but to lift her arms and push her breasts closer to his mouth. He moved his hands down her stomach and then lifted a breast free of her bra. When he gently sucked on it, she arched her back and gasped. He looked at her, his expression completely serious, his words cutting right through her mind and she felt the tension in her body slacken as he released the breast and lifted his hands from her.</p> <p>"Now," he said simply and, taking her right hand, he pulled her hand towards him and he laid her hand flat across the mattress. He lowered his head and looked at her, watching and waiting for her. He bent forward, kissing her palm and then pulling back to look right into her eyes. "You want this?"</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered.</p> <p>He leaned forward and put his mouth right on hers, gently sucking on first one and then the other of her soft lips. He could smell her perfume and the musky scent of the soap he had given her when he first had met her. He could taste her arousal as well, but it was so soft and smooth and tasted almost like honey. He brought his mouth right up to hers again and kissed her again, slowly at first and then more deeply and lovingly. He put another lip against hers and held it there, just barely brushing it as though he was afraid his lips might break it down. He kissed her one more time, slower this time, but in a way that was so sensual and tender and delicious. There was a fire within him, and he could feel it spreading through his heart and between his legs as her tongue snaked its way into his mouth in a long, slow, sensual rhythm. He wanted to move his mouth to taste her and to make love to her, and he wanted to give her the only gift she ever had. He could feel her breath coming more rapidly. He kissed her chin and then trailed his tongue down onto her throat.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Are you ready? Are you ready to make love to me?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she responded, her voice trembling. "If you can make it perfect, that's what I want." He kissed his way down her neck and throat, taking it gently as he had kissed her lips and then her breasts, until he reached the juncture of her thighs. She wanted him, she didn't know, but she knew to tell him she wanted his touch on her, too. He reached between her legs and pressed her hips down so he could move lower, pulling down her jeans in the process. He kissed and licked her thighs, finally arriving at her panties and teasing the insides with his tongue through her thighs.</p> <p>"Please," she whispered. "Touch me."</p> <p>"I will, baby," he promised, looking up at her. He smiled as her eyes opened. "Just let me touch you for awhile first. You're so perfect for me, it's like you just made a baby." He slid up her body and then brought her up. She moaned at the feeling of his lips on hers and his strong hands on her hips as he lifted her legs up to settle hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
