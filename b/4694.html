" she moans as she kisses me again on the lips. I feel her shudder but I know she wants me to stay. "It's okay, baby. If we keep on with this, we will get caught up in it."</p> <p>"It just feels so right, you feel so good in my arms. I don't know what I love more, the feeling of your skin on my skin or the smell of your breath. It's so good, baby, I want to keep feeling you."</p> <p>"I want to feel you... in my mouth, I want to get close and kiss you so deeply. I would love that, but we will have to wait though, I don't want to wait too long. After this, just wait, we will talk, we will have a wonderful time... you can kiss me if you want to...we can let this get pretty crazy."</p> <p>"Oh I'm so glad we keep this going, that we make enough noise for the rest of the party." she purrs as she kisses my lips repeatedly, "Mum just loves to wake me up with kisses and caresses. Will you love me that much, baby? Mums can be really horny, can you?"</p> <p>"That depends, I really love your mum, but you just got to know her a little first. I can't really tell you much about my mother, though."</p> <p>"Well, you have only been with her enough times, but she did ask for you when she was eighteen. Are you going to tell her now?"</p> <p>"Of course, baby. Let's start again tomorrow." and I pull her onto my lap, kissing her again, "I really love you and I'm looking forward to us seeing you again. You will have to ask her about me and how to dress."</p> <p>"I might think about it and ask her, after a little time alone, if she'd like to come here."</p> <p>"Well, I think it would be a good idea. Maybe we can find some sexting friends, just for a while... don't worry."</p> <p>"I know, darling."</p> <p>"Goodnight, baby," I breathe before pressing her lips and tongue back to my chestâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
