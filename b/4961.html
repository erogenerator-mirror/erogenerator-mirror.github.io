This must be a dream. This must be a real cock. But my pussy and my pussy can't get enough. My orgasm is building. I know I must go slow. Slow is the better word, slow is not. My body is shaking. God, this is so good. I need for release. Right now. I need you to cum with me. Fuck me with your cock. "</p> <p>You can hardly breathe.</p> <p>My body. My pussy. My mind. All my senses have gone awry. Just as your cock is going to explode and explode into me, I can feel the tip of your cock is just inches from me. You are rubbing the tip of it back and forth across my clit. I can't keep quiet. You know I can't. You are driving me crazy. I can't be quiet any longer. Cum. Cum! Cum with me! NOW!!!</p> <p>And I cum. This is it, my orgasm. The orgasm that made me fall into the abyss on top of the world. What happened there is still with me, but I can't move. I am too paralyzed to get out of there. Only you. Not even the stars. I am floating somewhere in the blackness, floating for all these hundreds and hundreds of miles in the desert. This all happens in less than a minute.</p> <p>I know I have died and gone to heaven.</p> <p>And it was a very long time. And it was a very long time. You did everything possible to get my mind and body ready to continue. But you had me so weak. So weak it was hurting. But you had me so ready. You said that I needed that release. So just as I said, there was nothing to do but let you release me. I needed to go slow. So slow was slow just so that I could enjoy every millisecond of your presence there.</p> <p>And as I said this, you did it. This was what made me come to this place. This was my new "real" life. I never wanted this to end. I never wanted to stop. But I couldn't. I was going to die.</p> <p>And even after all the years since I was born, I can feel it again. And the fire is still there. I don't know if I can move or if I will, I'm sure as all hell now. I just can't move. I don't know how, but I know that I will come. I just know that I will have what I will never have, or will never have again. Right now, I can feel the sun shining off of your face. You are my lover, my soul mate.</p> <p>It is not enough that you want me to go to sleep just yet. It is not enough that you feel that this is about to happen. That this is about to take place. So just as I said earlier, we can get it right. We can stay here, and let the sun light up your soul forever. And let us be happy with this life.</p> <p>Until then, your wish comes trueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
