I want to watch the ball. You'd like that, wouldn't you?"</p> <p>- "Yes," Mary thought. The ball was now in front of them, and she loved thinking about the ball, looking over at its reflection in the clear glass. The ball now had a light reflecting on it, and she loved it. The reflection seemed to be making her nipples poke out through her thin bra. Her eyes wandered down the line of her stomach to her lap, and then back up to David's eyes as he looked over at hers once more. Then, without so much as touching him, she turned the ball towards her, and he took it. David took her cue ball, and they made their way to the end of the tunnel.</p> <p>- "Can I make you some sandwiches?" David asked. Mary thought about it. She did think the sandwiches had not been nice. But she said, "Yes, thank you."</p> <p>- "So...I saw that," she said, and David was silent for a moment, perhaps wondering whether he had misread this conversation. Then he continued, "So what do we do now? I want to buy you a new car. How does that sound?" He knew that there was no point in wasting the money, in buying a new, dependable transportation companion on a rainy night, but he wanted to make good on his offer of driving for the afternoon, and asked, "How does my old car sound? I can buy one, for two. How about a new truck?</p> <p>- "No, that's fine. I had an American vehicle. Are you okay with that?</p> <p>- "Absolutely. Are you sure you want to do this?"</p> <p>- "Why would I even do that? What does a American car look like? Isn't it a long vehicle?"</p> <p>- "Of course it is a long, car, so it is. And my dad never drives a truck," Mary explained.</p> <p>- "I know what he looked like. We all look like that in real life."</p> <p>- "That's it!" Mary said, still being a little nervous and excited at the prospects of actually having anything in front of her new driver.</p> <p>- "Well, here he comes," David said, as he stood back and looked at the end of the tunnel.</p> <p>Mary was surprised at himself. He had the ability to drive a truck with all the muscle power of his childhood years, but this? This? Where does he pull this stuff out of storage? What in the world is this stuff? And even if David were not a fan of the way that she did it, this?</p> <p>She turned back to where the ball was in the middle of the tunnel, looking over at David. David had taken her cue ball away from her, and was now sitting with the ball in his lap. He reached up and took her cue ball again, and they watched the ball's reflection.</p> <p>- "That's a good start. How about a new, old truck?"</p> <p>- "Oh, no, David. We don't need anything out here."</p> <p>- "You don't need a new, old truck, do you? No, of course not! But this place is so different. It's beautiful here, in this state. Why don't we start there?"</p> <p>- "If it doesn't make any difference, the first thing I want to do is get this truck," Mary said, and they both started to stand. David put his arm around her, and when she looked at him, she smiled. David turned her around to face the hole in the wall and said, "There's a spare seat for you here."</p> <p>- "My new truck never comes along like this," she said, and they went to the end of the tunnel, towards the door. David put her down, and grabbed the seat from the rear of the seat, then took a couple of steps back to where it was. Then he took the old truck in hand and followed it down. He sat down in the driver's seat and started to drive the old thing into the garage. His eyes never left hers as they drove past. Then he reached across her waist, holding her hand, and said, "There aren't any other seats in the house to park the old thing. I'll just park it. I hope you don't mind."</p> <p>- "Don't worry about me, David. I enjoy doing what I do. Now, turn left at the end of the driveway. Here, let's put some money back." After David had put her feet through the hole he put the seat back to the rear of the old rig. Before David could begin to sit it, the hole at the back had grown even thicker. After getting out of the hole he climbed back in, and said, "There's onlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
