It struck me that this stranger looked at her, and at me, in the way that he was now looking at me. My heart beat faster. I'm sure it was in my imagination. I smiled and turned to the bathroom door that leads into the next room.</p> <p>"We have a little privacy. Go ahead and turn on the shower jets. It's only the two of us here," she said as she lifted one foot in the water and pushed it out, taking off her shoes and putting them aside. She held the warm water and I began to do with her the bath oil to help me soap her down. She began to soap herself up before turning around to look at me. She rubbed my chest, running her hands over my breasts. She gave my stomach a couple of slow, circular rubs.</p> <p>"Mmm. You have an awfully nice body," she laughed as she gave me a smile, her voice was rich, as it always was. "It's been a while since I've been out alone like this," she said, looking down at my hard cock. She gave a little shudder as she felt it grow against her belly. She looked up at my face, her eyes were still glazed slightly.</p> <p>"This just might make me a little late," she teased and reached for the shower tap. She rinsed me off and handed it to me. I took the bar from its place on the bar and she walked to the side of the bathtub. I moved to her side of the tub. My hands ran over her, my hands making her skin glisten. I leaned forward, rubbing the soap lightly against her cheeks and neck. She shivered as my hands touched her.</p> <p>"Turn around and put your hands over the side of the tub," I said, my body sliding up hers. She slid onto her stomach as I lifted myself up from the tub.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked, looking at me, her hands covering mine.</p> <p>"Just for the moment," I returned, slipping my hand between her legs. She leaned forward slightly as my fingers probed deeper, searching for her hidden treasure. I could feel the moisture beginning to trickle down her thighs as my finger made contact with her.</p> <p>"No...not yet."</p> <p>"If you feel anything I might be more than a little embarrassed."</p> <p>"You know I'm your friend's wife, you would never take advantage of it." Her eyes closed and a smile came across her face. As I moved closer, I felt her hand reach up to run through my hair. I moved with her so that I could kiss her, I had no intentions of stopping until my lips met hers. My tongue slid against hers, pushing it inside her mouth, exploring her mouth as the water splashed on our bodies. My hand slid up between us to touch her pussy, I could feel her warm juices as my fingers pressed into her.</p> <p>"You have a sweet spot...so I'm glad to know," I said.</p> <p>"Mmmm...yes." We continued kissing as her hands touched mine. "Oh that feels sooo good," she said. I felt her mouth go to my ear for no more than a second before her hand went back down between her legs. I could feel her fingertips press against the lips of her pussy, her wetness flowing easily onto my fingers. I ran a fingertip in slow circles across her lips, my finger sliding easily into her tight hole.</p> <p>"A little wet here," I said, my voice low as my touch made her gasp. "Do you want to watch? I'd love to see what you do to yourself."</p> <p>"Yes...yes," she answered between kisses. I moved my head down, planting a kiss in the small gap between her lips. I slid the tip of my tongue inside, my other hand pulling her toward me. My free hand slipped beneath her to begin to stroke the lips and then caress over her clit. She moaned as her hand moved, I pushed a finger farther inside and then slid it out quickly.</p> <p>"Oh fuck...." she breathed. Her hands left mine to slide down into the small of my back, pressing her against me. Her hips began to grind slowly and as I felt her hand press against my ass, I raised my head.</p> <p>"No...not yet," I said, as my finger returned to her lips. Her eyes were still glazed over. I pulled my finger out and slid my finger up to her lips.</p> <p>"What's in your mouth?" I asked, moving toward her ear, "Is something you'd like to taste?"</p> <p>"I'm...ah...not sure." I felt her lips run over mine, her tongue tracing the edges of my lips.</p> <p>"I think youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
