But I'm a bit old for that part of you."</p> <p>"It's ok. I didn't think you'd leave so soon after our first night," I said and her smile got bigger. "I just loved your hair. It looks so sexy on you." I reached back to grab her hand and pull her closer to my lips.</p> <p>"And you must never tell anyone about that. It doesn't matter."</p> <p>"Oh, I wouldn't do that," she said as she leaned down and kissed me. I felt her hand close around my shoulder and it took all the strength I had not to grab her and pull her tight against me.</p> <p>After giving my tongue a quick lick, she pulled away a bit and whispered into my ear, "What do you want me to do for you?"</p> <p>"That, I think, is up to you." I reached down and pulled on her hand and pulled her closer until her hair fell back and her soft lips brushed mine. I could feel the excitement building up in her again and I knew she was more than ready.</p> <p>I was already pulling her dress up, leaving her with only a thong on, when she suddenly broke away from me to pull the dress over her head. I couldn't help but stare at her breasts, which were perky, firm and just a bit wobbly from the rush of heat in them. "What do you think?" I asked as I cupped her breasts and pulled her down so I could lick her nipple.</p> <p>"Are you sure this is a good idea?" she asked in a nervous voice.</p> <p>"Of course." I looked down at her small breasts and sucked on the end of her nipple while I held her closer. "They're beautiful," I said, and she moaned as she closed her eyes and leaned her head back on my shoulder.</p> <p>When she moved back up again, the feeling of her body against mine was incredible. I pushed her hips down and lifted her to me so it was more of a turn-on. She was on her back now and looking at me again. "I'm not sure of what else I want to do," she said, not looking me in the eye. "Just let me do something for you." That was it. It didn't surprise me at all how much I wanted to kiss her. "Ok." If she didn't tell me, I didn't care. I wanted her to know what I really meant by "don't do anything else for you."</p> <p>"That sounds like a good idea," I said as I pulled back from her and sat up. I moved between her legs and pulled them apart. "You're beautiful," I said almost apologetically, and she smiled and nodded.</p> <p>I had a difficult time getting my camera out of its hiding place. Her eyes were closed and she was biting her lower lip so I reached out and took a picture of my own breasts, which were quite pretty in my opinion. She hadn't moved yet, so I let my eyes wander over them and found them staring right back at me. There was nothing that I couldn't touch and I liked that she liked it when she did it.</p> <p>I put my hands on her thighs and spread her legs as far apart as the strap of her thong would allow, revealing what I wanted. "What do you want to do?" I asked, taking another picture, focusing on her pussy. "Come and fuck me," she said and she lifted her hips up to me as she spread herself open for me. I moved between her legs and lifted them up and over my shoulders, taking a picture, getting a better angle as she closed herself around me. She pushed her hips up a bit and moaned, but didn't move her body. "Oh God," she said, pulling me tight against her and pushing her breasts against me while pulling me close.</p> <p>"God, I needed that," I said, letting go of her legs and reaching up to touch her chest. This time, her chest covered hers as I got closer, touching her skin there where we both wanted it. She tilted her neck and opened her eyes and looked at me before closing her eyes again. I lowered myself and lowered my hands down toward her.</p> <p>She brought them up higher until I was touching her clit and she let me touch that until she moaned again. I let her pull her pelvis up with her legs and moved my hands down until I caressed her butt that was still pointing up. She put one knee up on the bed and the other knee down, giving me room to move up to where I wanted. When I slid down between her legs again, she looked back at me and opened her eyes again. She raised her knees up just higher as I kissed her. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
