She kissed my cheek gently.</p> <p>"I love you and love you too." And then she turned and strode off.</p> <p>I sat there, watching her walk away, feeling almost lost. How could she possibly think such a thing, knowing that if I came anywhere near her, they all would disappear forever, I just assumed it would be on me.</p> <p>But at least now I knew why, why my wife never wanted me near. And if they all kept on going, she'd be back on top in just about any case. I just hoped she was in for a great sex life.</p> <p>The rest of the evening passed by uneventfully. I did not think about whether or not I wanted that again, that night or the next, but I did not have much fun either, though my mind was very clear just from the conversation.</p> <p>Friday after work, I decided, if I could just sit back and wait. I figured it would be the best thing to come up with a way to get through the night without getting into a fight. Besides, I'd rather have a fight and have that little fun that I knew was coming.</p> <p>It was getting dark when I got into the house and saw that my wife and her two friends were downstairs. It was apparent from the way they were acting that I'd never seen my wife so openly flirted with them before, if anything less.</p> <p>My wife's head was down, her blouse pulled up and bunched around her waist, her long blonde hair falling across her shoulders. She was sitting in one of the armchairs. She looked good enough so, with a little more movement and a smile of approval, I knew it would be fine for her just like it always seemed to be.</p> <p>"Hello?" she said, as I walked in.</p> <p>"Hi. Sorry I startled you guys. We were just getting started."</p> <p>"We're glad you guys are getting along okay."</p> <p>"You know what," my wife said, giving me a little wink. "I know you're enjoying our friend, but we are also about to have some fun with her next," she added with a little giggle.</p> <p>With that, my wife dropped her head back and the girls burst out laughing.</p> <p>"It'll be a while," Katie giggled. "We'd better get back to enjoying what we've been waiting for."</p> <p>"I hope so," I answered, and as I headed back upstairs to my bedroom, I decided that the best bet might be to ask my wife about the night.</p> <p>We were back again in a few minutes. My wife had a huge grin on her face and she was laughing so hard that her eyes were rolling up and she looked as if some kind of drug had taken hold.</p> <p>"So, honey," she said. "How was your week?"</p> <p>"It was better," I whispered back to her, as we both tried to keep our voices down. But even the sound of her laughter was enough to drown the rest of the way together.</p> <p>"Well, I hope you are satisfied with what we have been doing and if I'm wrong about the other night we will never get to return from another trip to Jamaica, or our cruise. Don't worry, we'll get to Jamaica soon enough."</p> <p>I decided she needed to talk to us in private. She had some important things to tell us and that would only happen when we found the time.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>"How are you feeling?" I asked as I dropped to my knees and crawled up the bed.</p> <p>"Wonderful," my wife answered. "And I hope you're not having second thoughts about our last conversation. I know you are probably wondering what happened between us, but I think you know better that you're thinking with the head than you know. I just don't want you going completely off base thinking that I really screwed up or anything other than having fun with them."</p> <p>She looked up at me, smiled, and blew me a kiss and she was off her bed.</p> <p>My mind just stayed on her and I could not tell if my wife had enjoyed sex more or not. All I could think about were her amazing tits and soft, silky skin on my face and it was not helping my cock any.</p> <p>In spite of all my sexual excitement, my brain was working overtime trying to figure out what had happened with my wife and Katie. Had it all just been a one night stand? But as I slowly became aware of the fact that my wife, my wife, was standing over me staring at me, and then my body, I felt as if I was still alive.</p> <p>My wife stood there wearing a short skirt and a skimpy top thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
