My body jerked, and I moaned loudly, but I didn't care. That was how my mind was when I'd come from having his cock pressed up against me with my pussy being fucked by him.</p> <p>Now, all I felt were his hands gripping my bare ass, pulling my body up and down against his, his cock sliding in and out of me.</p> <p>When his hands fell away from my ass, I felt something else, something I didn't understand it at all.</p> <p>His fingers were buried between my own legs, stroking my clit like it was the last time he went there.</p> <p>After a moment, he pulled out of me. "Don't move," he said. "That's the second orgasm I've ever seen you have in you."</p> <p>He left my vagina aching, but I still felt his hands holding my butt. My legs wrapped themselves around his waist as I rode him, my back arching.</p> <p>"It's okay, baby," he said to me. "I won't be gentle." He pulled my bottom toward him and began fucking me with long, slow strokes.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," I said, feeling like I was being torn apart. "Oh, God, oh, fucking hell!"</p> <p>He pulled his cock straight out of my pussy again, then quickly jammed it back inside as far as it could go. His hips smacked up into my lower back and I was overwhelmed with sensations of pure bliss. The sounds of our fucking echoed around the room.</p> <p>With two feet of pure pleasure and pure joy, I was having an orgasm of my own. I began to cry out. "Ah, God," I said, and then we were both done. I collapsed onto the bed, and after a while, my breathing returned to normal.</p> <p>He held me tight, and we kissed and cuddled and talked about what we'd just done.</p> <p>"You were terrific," I said. "That was the most intense orgasm I've ever had."</p> <p>"You're an amazing, beautiful young woman," he nodded in agreement. "I hope we can do that again; again, I hope to see you again soon."</p> <p>We lay, cuddling, for several minutes, before, suddenly, it changed to a concerned voice: "Who's going to be waiting at the door with a new girl? You'll meet with me and I'll tell you everything."</p> <p>She was right. What else could I do? I had to go home. I was ready to walk the mile from there to the train station, then meet up with Mark.</p> <p>"I can't," I said. "It'd drive me crazy to know you and I, at the same time."</p> <p>"You have a right to know. It'd be nice to meet you, too, but I'd feel terrible if I didn't, too. If you'd only stay on the train, if we did meet, and were really close together... I'd be sorry for not going with you."</p> <p>I didn't say anything like that.</p> <p>With only a look from me and a half-hearted wave, he left the room and the house after that, and that was that.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The next day in class, with a little help from Mark, I got a text from the other girl, "I want to meet them. Please bring two double beds, with double covers, that I left as an extra pillow in the room!"</p> <p>She was pretty, just like the rest of us, and she was cute. She was about five foot five, with shoulder lengthish brown-black hair. Her figure was all hips and curves, and she had a pretty face and big breasts. We were all in our last year at college, and we'd all been friends with each other; we'd all shared our rooms.</p> <p>We'd all been assigned a single bed. She told me that I was supposed to sleep in the middle, with the top of the frame above the mattress, but under the sheets, she'd take over the middle section for her roommate.</p> <p>As we had planned, we got there around 7 that Tuesday.</p> <p>After we had finished taking turns in the bathroom, getting ready for class, she took her time. I sat her down on the edge of her bed, in her white one-piece sleepshirt, and helped her in. I felt her naked back and butt under my hands, so I had her turn around, which I did.</p> <p>There was a slight sound of fabric being put on, then the top of one of the bed's pillows shifted, and it was me. I climbed on the bed, facing the other way, and laid my head upon her stomach.</p> <p>"My turn," I said, and my weight shifted over herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
