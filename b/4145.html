Sarah laughed again.</p> <p>'No way.' I sighed.</p> <p>The next few minutes were a haze. Sarah's arms were around me and she was whispering something in my ears or some other piece of music. I wanted to say something back like I had earlier, but somehow it just seemed a little too intimate. She was so soft. Her breasts pressing into my back, her smooth belly pulling me close to her soft body, her firm breasts pressing into my back.</p> <p>Just as I wanted to say something, I felt a hand on top of mine, and I looked down just in time to see her face, her expression impassive but slightly amused as she looked across at me.</p> <p>"Is that you...?" she broke off suddenly. "This is your girlfriend?" the redhead asked.</p> <p>"You know Sarah?" Sarah said. She had a small voice, but I couldn't quite place it. I found it hard to place her at all.</p> <p>The redhead's eyes darted to me briefly, then to Sarah and back again, and the expression on the girl's face was one of... of... of what? Of what she'd heard? Oh god, this was wrong.</p> <p>I didn't say anything.</p> <p>Sarah put one arm around my neck and leaned down to kiss me, and in my confusion I grabbed her and pulled her head up, our lips crashing together at first and then parting as our tongues quickly sought each other out. I was shocked to feel her tongue slide in and out between my lips and I could feel as she took my breath away. Sarah pressed her lips together and I met her mouth with mine, pressing my tongue between hers.</p> <p>It took my breath away. This gorgeous girl had done that to me.</p> <p>The kiss was broken when the redhead broke it.</p> <p>"We don't really know what we're missing here." she chuckled, but she was still smiling in a way that would've been incredibly attractive on anyone other than Sarah.</p> <p>"It's okay, sweetie."</p> <p>I looked back at her as if to say, "This is just what I thought it would be like."</p> <p>Sarah's brows rose, but she didn't say a word. I didn't know how to react. I'd never been in this situation before, but what the fuck just happened? I tried not to think about it, but my stomach did flip-flops, and I was still a little bit aroused from the wine we had consumed.</p> <p>"Now, you're not making out just for me," Sarah said softly. "I want you to just do a lot of things to me, okay?"</p> <p>I smiled, "Of course."</p> <p>I looked back at her. The rest of the crowd seemed to be talking with each other. That didn't surprise me.</p> <p>Sarah continued to hold me. "Let's dance a little bit."</p> <p>As she said it she started to move her body even closer to me and started to rub my arm or my hip. My cock was swelling, and it pressed against my skirt. I looked over at Sarah as she moved in closer. My hand wandered onto her ass and grabbed it, squeezing it roughly in a little squeeze. The redhead just laughed and shook her head but she still looked up at me, her eyes staring into mine, holding a finger against her lips.</p> <p>I just moved my hand along her bare thigh. She lifted her other leg, sliding it up the chair. I slowly inched towards her on one side, as if it was my fault she had to feel her up. She put her leg over mine and pressed it against my groin.</p> <p>As the song started I put my hand on her leg again, feeling it warm and soft as it pressed against my cock. It was a weird feeling to run my hand over her inner thigh, feeling her skin taut underneath, but it felt right, as was evident by the feel of her hips pressing together to mine. I slipped my hand up the soft fabric of her skirt again, up to just below her breast. I couldn't believe this. This was something I'd done on a number just to tease her, not just to make the night of my life.</p> <p>After a few more songs I slid my hand up her inner thigh in the same manner, and I felt Sarah shiver. If she didn't want to tell me, she didn't need to say what she did. I wasn't sure exactly what to do now. I tried to think of something else.</p> <p>"This is just so different," I said.</p> <p>"Different?" Sarah asked. "I know what you mean."</p> <p>"Maybe we shouldn't be here."</p> <p>"Why? You're just sitting there with me and a few people," I said. I could feel myself blushing.</p> <p>I turnedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
