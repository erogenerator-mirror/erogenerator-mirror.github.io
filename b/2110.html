"Why don't you take a break and have a look at that pretty slut?"</p> <p>Looking at me, she said, "It's all gone, so it looks as though she wants to see you. Well, it might not be as pretty as it looks but it seems like she is trying to figure out how to get that outfit off."</p> <p>I could feel my cheeks go red and I was suddenly ashamed of the thing she saw in me. But she wouldn't stop speaking to me, even when I refused to even look at her.</p> <p>After a few minutes of this, she got up to gather up the trash and took care not to stare at my body as she left. I was a little confused about why I thought this would be easier than trying to leave.</p> <p>On her way out, I felt the need for a pee. I could not explain it. I could have just stayed quiet. But my bladder was really full, and I didn't really want to have to go. But as soon as she walked away, I was in trouble. I had been trying at all different things with women. I had never been interested in sex in the slightest. And, although there were certain urges at the core of my lust and my body at the peak of desire, there was also fear of what I would do if I were caught peeking into her dressing room.</p> <p>I made my decision and as soon as I was out the door I rushed into the bathroom. I didn't even bother brushing my hair which took my breath away. It was a combination of my fear of what might happen, and the thought of what would happen if I peeped into a room in the club to see if any woman was in there, would have me arrested.</p> <p>As I pulled out of my stall, I realized that I was still covered with my own piss and the whole thing felt strangely exhilarating in a way. I had tried it once in the men's room and I knew that I really didn't want to be discovered. But the thought of watching my friend in that club, in a place where there were people watching made me feel alive, and once I was past all that, I started to lose control. I reached down and felt my cock starting to get stiffer under the jeans I was wearing.</p> <p>As I looked around the room from the corner of my eyes, I saw a dark man staring to the back, looking back at me.</p> <p>"I'd like to give you a tip if you do watch me," she whispered to me.</p> <p>I turned to give her a quick look over her shoulder. Her hair was spread out on the bench, so I knew she was really checking out any possibility of what was going on.</p> <p>"Oh," I said, and she immediately flashed an embarrassed look back to me.</p> <p>"Yes, that's it," she said. "You want an extra tip for following me around like we're her escort?"</p> <p>"I.. uh. Thanks, but I'm not really... looking..."</p> <p>I couldn't believe it myself! What must I do?</p> <p>I turned around to return the favor. "Here's another tip. Come around after your shift," she said.</p> <p>I turned to her and was shocked to see that she still had that cute tinge to her voice. She sounded like a little girl who had just gotten a puppy.</p> <p>I hurried over and waited while she came and sat next to me. It was a little awkward feeling being in a booth watching someone of the opposite sex while I finished getting my clothes out of the hamper. All through the entire shift, I could feel the tension in the situation increase, as I watched her. I glanced at the clock and figured, what the fuck, it's past 2 am and it's time to start the morning at the beach.</p> <p>She made me so excited that I didn't notice if she leaned over next to me as I started to get out of the booth. Before I was ready, she put her hand on my thigh and started to lightly stroke my cock through the jeans. At that moment the waitress came over, and I almost couldn't keep still. As the waitress took our orders, I saw her eyes move lower on my body until she got to her knees on the floor. What the hell! I thought to myself.</p> <p>I watched as she slowly slid her mouth right up the length of my cock and slowly slid her lips over my cock. It felt like electricity ran through my body. When she had her lips all the way around my cock, I knew right then that I was about to come in front of her face.</p> <p>She looked up at me and asked softly, "Is everything alright in there?"</p> <p>I couldn't talk just looking into her eyes as her head bobbed up and downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
