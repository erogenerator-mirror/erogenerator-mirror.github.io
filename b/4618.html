The soft material felt as if it was on fire, but the heat from the fire was spreading from her naked body.</p> <p>Just as the thoughts swirled around her head, there was a sudden flash of pain. A small hand was on her shoulder. She turned to find a young man holding two sharp whips. His grip was so tight she expected to be slapped or whipped. As she watched he swung the whips harder. In one quick thrust her entire body was covered in silky red material. The sound of cracking whips echoed as the young man slapped her repeatedly with all the strength he could muster.</p> <p>The leather straps came together with another resounding thwack followed by a final slap with the crop. Her whole body shuddered with emotion as the sensations washed through her form and soul. She knew that if she didn't take her pain now they would only last a little longer. "Now I will use these on others."</p> <p>"I'm sorry.. please don't," she moaned. "You know they hurt," she cried.</p> <p>The young man let her go and she slowly rose to her feet. She was ashamed of the red lipstick she sported, but at least she would have to show her face.</p> <p>"I'll be back later," he smiled at her. "I have to leave right now."</p> <p>"No..please..." She looked to the floor where her feet were still numb with her tears. He would have to come back and finish her off.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"But I don't think..." she stopped mid-breath.</p> <p>"You still have to let me," he said softly. "I will come back."</p> <p>"No, leave me alone," she said softly. Her knees buckled as she felt her arms pull at her ropes. They were now both dangling from the ceiling.</p> <p>"Come," he said as he took her in his arms. She tried to get away, but his body shushed her. He grabbed her ass and pulled her hard against him. Her mouth closed on his as he kissed her. She could feel his hardness under her skirt. His lips moved to her neck and then she closed her eyes.</p> <p>As his hands moved over her body she felt his fingers run over her clit and her body arched against him. He broke from his kiss and slid his hands along her naked body before she could move away. He moved them down between her legs and cupped her wet pussy.</p> <p>"I think I can help you with this," he said.</p> <p>"No," she begged. "Please no."</p> <p>"I will think of something else," he said as he ran his hand over her clit again. He rubbed his fingers over it gently with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm sorry..please...."</p> <p>"Don't be sorry," he whispered. "Just tell me when to stop. Please."</p> <p>"I am sorry..... I am so..."</p> <p>"Don't even ask if I'm going to do this for you.. I may even have you do it for me."</p> <p>"No, please," she said firmly.</p> <p>He smiled and pushed her hips away from him. Pulling himself up at her waist, his hands ran over her breasts before he lowered his mouth to a breast. His hand continued to rub her pussy. He pulled at her nipple through the cloth of her teddy, knowing he would leave a streak of blood where it joined the thin material. As his mouth found her breast, feeling the softness of it, his hand slid over her pussy, over the softness that had only moments before been so exposed in front of him. A shiver ran over her body as his finger found her clit. He sucked at her breast as he played with her. As his mouth trailed along her breast he sucked at it, then lightly bit at the nipple. He bit her like a cat would bite at a mouse.</p> <p>"Oh my God..." she cried out.</p> <p>His lips pressed against her again and again until finally his fingers curled and he slipped them slowly and gently into the soaked opening to her pussy. He ran his fingers softly over it, feeling her body shudder in response to the feel of his touch. His lips were on hers again, but he turned them back to the nipple.</p> <p>"God..ohh..."</p> <p>"Do you want me?" He whispered into her ear as he fingered her. "Do you think you can come?"</p> <p>"No!" she cried out softly.</p> <p>"Oh, god yes..." he said in her ear. "But if you're not good enough, I'll just come back."</p> <p>His fingers moved up her body and touched her stomach. The heat from her arousal made him feel sick to his stomach. There was something about her. Something that was repulsive or dangerous or dangerous. He pushed his fingers into her. "Please," he begged.</p> <p>"Noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
