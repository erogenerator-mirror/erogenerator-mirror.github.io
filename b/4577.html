"We like to play outside." To reinforce his point, my hand rose to his groin.</p> <p>I felt the familiar hardness of him. My heart fluttered; I was nervous, excited. The thought made me even wetter as my fingers rubbed his length.</p> <p>"I want to make love," I thought. To please him, my hand went to his pants. His warm hand clasped it as he pulled his pants and pants down. He was as stiff as I expected from the bulge in his pants as my hand went inside and closed over him. His hand squeezed mine. Our eyes opened as his cock started to twitch.</p> <p>I saw his eyes glaze with lust. His finger tips parted my bra. Then they moved to stroke my breasts as they stood proudly, high and perky, on display. I felt the hardness of his cock as it twitched with his hand. His eyes roved over my body in wanton abandon, watching the lust in my eyes. I reached between them to wrap one hand around him. He groaned his approval as I cupped and massaged his balls and shaft. His fingers rubbed my nipples, pulling at them, rolling them both in his fingers until they stiffened and hardened.</p> <p>I slipped my fingers through my hair. I closed my eyes as his fingers spread my lips, pushing them apart and penetrating my pussy. I could feel him inside me.</p> <p>"Take it...slowly," I muttered, trying to control my breathing.</p> <p>"Don't...let...me cum yet," he murmured, his voice thick. I opened my eyes; he was watching me with his mouth agape.</p> <p>"Hands on my shoulders," I said, "like this."</p> <p>The feeling of control was indescribable. I turned around, offering his cock up to me. It hung straight out, almost touching me. I leaned forward, the tip pressing into the top of the hair-lined cleft between my legs. I rubbed a line with my other hand over his hairy pubic mound. My fingers opened my labia, revealing my pinkness, the pinkness of my labia and the clit. He was glistening with my juice and precum. I opened my mouth and kissed his swollen, bulbous cock head. I tasted my own arousal on the tip of his cock as my lips kissed it.</p> <p>"Mmm," he hissed, "this feels so good," as I started to lick his prick. His hips started to gyrate slowly, forcing his hardness deeper into my mouth. I licked the underside of his cock, pressing his tip on the roof of my mouth. Then I lifted his cock away from my mouth, the swollen head shiny and wet. I licked it from the base to the tip before swallowing the whole of its length.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus!" he gasped, "suck me a little more honey," as I slowly and deliberately licked his prick, taking just his balls into my mouth, holding them as it slid out, then licking again. "Oh," he growled as I repeated the sucking motion with his shaft, each time sucking it deeper into my mouth. He was fully hard, his shaft twitching, pulsing, as he neared the brink of orgasm. My hand wrapped around his shaft and he moaned, his hips lifting off the pool table.</p> <p>My hand kept up the rhythm and I knew he needed to cum again. I increased the tempo, stroking him, licking him, sucking him, taking him deeper into my mouth. My tongue worked over his flesh. The salty taste of pre-cum on my tongue was heavenly. He pulled me to him. The angle was perfect. I wrapped my right leg around his hip and raised the back of my knee off the floor, to give him access to my cunt. I held his cock stiff and throbbing as it slipped back out of my mouth. His finger found my erect clitoris, his palm firmly gripping it, his fingers probing my cunt as his thumb found my clit. I threw back my head, the image of my face being pounded by a big stiff cock sent my excitement soaring along my spine, making my cunt throb even harder.</p> <p>My orgasm was as explosive as his. A flood of juices poured over my fingers as my body spasmed in orgasm. He was so excited, I lost count of his words as my orgasm continued all through my body. My nipples stiffened against his palm as my hand continued to pump up and down on his shaft.</p> <p>He pushed two fingers deep inside of me. I was so slick that he easily slid another inch or so into my hot hole. His thumb found my clit again. I could feel the throbbing in his fingers and he worked the whole length of his prick intoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
