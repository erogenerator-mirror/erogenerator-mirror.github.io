He moaned.</p> <p>"Your panties are wet," I said, looking at him.</p> <p>"My panties aren't," he said.</p> <p>"But my dick is getting hard. You'll know soon enough what the hard part is," I said.</p> <p>"My dick? Oh my god, you're a virgin?" he asked, with his eyes still locked on mine.</p> <p>"No, I didn't have any hymen. I don't even know what it means," I replied.</p> <p>He looked disappointed and I looked down at his penis. When did we have to do all that and still have to take his virginity? He got nervous. He got up and walked around the bed and pulled me over his face. I put the panties on his forehead and he looked up at me. He kissed the crotch of my panties and then took the panties in his teeth.</p> <p>"Oh, my god, you smell nice, too," I said, pulling him back onto the bed and kissing him. He lay back on the bed, and I moved over him. I put his dick near the entrance of my vagina and he spread his legs apart. I slowly slid down on his cock with my hips.</p> <p>I got up on my knees and put my head down.</p> <p>"My boyfriend does this quite a lot," I said.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p> <p>"He makes me do it."</p> <p>I reached over and grabbed a tube of hand lotion and rubbed it all over his dick and balls. He smiled. He got a little lightheaded. I could feel my own dick getting hard, but he didn't notice.</p> <p>I slid off his dick and grabbed his penis again, sliding on the lotion.</p> <p>"I want to feel you inside me," I said.</p> <p>I got back over him. I was getting close and I wanted in on it. I lay down next to him and he put his hand on my butt. He massaged the cheeks of my ass. He slid a finger inside me. I moaned. He rubbed me all over a few seconds before bringing his finger up to his mouth to clean my sperm from my crack.</p> <p>My dick was throbbing and I could feel it against my stomach.</p> <p>"Did you get off at the same time," he asked.</p> <p>I had never let that question come out. I had to find out.</p> <p>"Yes," I said, pulling his hand to my mouth and kissing it. I kissed his fingers, then let him taste another man off of them. My erection was pulsing and I could feel the blood pounding down there. Then I kissed him again, passionately, and he put his lips on mine. His tongue entered my mouth. He put one arm under me and I reached down to the back of his neck and pulled him into me. He moved his hands up and down my back. I kissed him again. He pulled my panties off and I spread them around my waist. I grabbed a condom from my purse. I rolled it down his penis which had the thickest piece of rubber on.</p> <p>A condom was about to be used on another man. I was going to make the first man. I took his cock head in my hand and looked over it. I took him in my pussy while he reached his free arm around me, pulling my breasts out of the bra. I reached for my lubricant.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" I asked.</p> <p>He nodded. I got all the way on top of him and felt the head of his penis hit right in the middle of my vagina.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh, my god. I have never done it, you know, so fast. It's such a turn-on. Is it really possible to put it in before it hurts you?" I said.</p> <p>I put the head of his dick at the entrance of both of my holes while he adjusted my panties from my neck to my face and pushed it in.</p> <p>"Uhh. Oh. Yes. It's good, now, but it hurts a little."</p> <p>I did too.</p> <p>"I don't care," I said.</p> <p>He did too, pushing itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
