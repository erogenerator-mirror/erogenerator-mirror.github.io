"Hello."</p> <p>He looked away; she moved closer, straddling his lap and began sliding herself up and down his length, using his member to rub against her clit again. "My name is Mariko," she said. "It's been awhile since you've called me that."</p> <p>He looked up at her before he responded. "Yes, sorry, I didn't realize you were even in the bar."</p> <p>"I am," she smiled and leaned down for another kiss, her full breasts pressed against his chest before she broke away and turned around, placing herself on the couch and began sliding her panties off her ass.</p> <p>His hands began roaming up her back to her breasts, and suddenly Mariko took his hand and began squeezing and massaging her perky breasts.</p> <p>He was a little shy, being with a guy, but his hormones hadn't been a priority all those years, he didn't want to seem as awkward about being with a girl as he was. He had to learn to control himself around women, so he tried to figure that out on his own.</p> <p>She smiled, leaning forward and taking his hands in hers, running them over her hips, over her stomach, down between her legs.</p> <p>"I know that looks weird," he whispered, feeling awkward, but he found his hands beginning to get sweaty, as he tried to cover himself up.</p> <p>She smiled, pulling his shorts and underwear off, and she placed one foot up on the couch next to him and began sliding her panties down her thighs and onto his shoulders and chest.</p> <p>He began to panic, he had no idea what he was going to do. "Um..." he said, but before he could react, she was shimmying back onto his shoulders and was pulling him onto the couch with her. "I'm not sure how," he blurted out when she pushed him onto his back.</p> <p>Mariko climbed off the couch and came up to him before he could speak as she straddled him, grabbing his cock and pressing it into her before she leaned over to start kissing him again. She could feel his hard body against her as she pressed against him, and she moaned against his mouth. "How long have you been with women?" she asked, looking into his eyes.</p> <p>"Since yesterday," he moaned. "How long have you had a boyfriend, Mariko?"</p> <p>"Until yesterday," she replied. "Not long, actually." She leaned away from him, taking his hand and placing it on her ass. "And I'd kind of suspected that you were a guy for a while."</p> <p>"I uh... well yeah, I guess I've been with girls, but I didn't know that it could be done with just a kiss."</p> <p>"Oh that's because you didn't know a single girl with a thing for guys?" she replied, giving his cock a quick squeeze.</p> <p>"No, Mariko."</p> <p>She smiled slightly before she slid off him and grabbed his hand, pushing it back between her legs and guiding it inside her.</p> <p>He groaned as her fingers wrapped around his wrist, and she leaned down on him again, grinding herself on his dick. "It seems that my sister got a special gift to you," she said, sliding her fingers up his arm. "Don't you like to make love to me?" They were both breathing heavily, her words sent shivers down his spine.</p> <p>"Don't worry, Mariko," he responded, "I would love to make love to you."</p> <p>"You just lie there and kiss me," she told him before pulling away from him and sitting up, reaching between them to undo her jeans. He gasped as he felt her hand sliding inside his underwear and reaching out for his cock.</p> <p>"I'm just going to make sure that you're nice and hard," she said, pulling his underwear aside and looking over his shoulder at him. Her eyes were sparkling with arousal as she took him in her hand and guided him towards her opening.</p> <p>The feeling of his naked and hard flesh against her was unlike anything he'd ever experienced. It was something he had never really thought about, not liking cocks, but he found himself looking forward to it. It was kind of weird, having to do that on some guy's wife while not even realizing it might happen.</p> <p>"You're going to try to come in me," she told him, rubbing the head against her opening. "If I'm not so sure then it will hurt."</p> <p>"Oh Mariko," he whimâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
