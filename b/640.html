I don't think I've ever felt so vulnerable yet," she panted.</p> <p>"You're making it harder for me to concentrate, so it's going to hurt if I just keep kissing you that much longer," Dave complained as his lips left her neck, kissing gently, trailing his fingernails up and down her spine before finally pulling away.</p> <p>She looked directly into his eyes.</p> <p>"You can always stop now."</p> <p>In response, he kissed her neck.</p> <p>"No, I'll get it!" she shouted.</p> <p>In another quick second he was gone, leaving her feeling bereft, naked, alone.</p> <p>Shirley started to get up, but Dave stopped her.</p> <p>"I want to make love with you, right here."</p> <p>His hand reached down and slid his condom on before undoing his jeans. He pulled his cock out, holding it at the ready and pushing his jeans free.</p> <p>"No. Don't," she pleaded.</p> <p>"No, silly. I'm going to fuck you, just like this."</p> <p>In shock, she didn't know what to do, or even what to say, but she was stunned.</p> <p>Dave's hand reached out for her, as he stepped closer to her.</p> <p>"Wait," he insisted, "stay back a little. I don't want to be the first one inside you while you're on your back."</p> <p>Again, she hesitated. She was getting frustrated.</p> <p>"Do it," Dave insisted and her fingers tried to undo the knot to undo his jeans.</p> <p>"Not yet," she finally said.</p> <p>She pulled his jeans all the way off and he stepped out of them.</p> <p>"I can't wait," she insisted, staring up at him.</p> <p>She was looking up at his cock, standing at attention, inches away from her. It seemed bigger from her perspective. It had been hanging there, semi-erect, just waiting for her to take it in her mouth. In her mind's eye, she stared into his eyes, waiting for what he wanted.</p> <p>"What is it?" she wondered</p> <p>"You can do anything you want. I'll just have to wait," he retorted.</p> <p>With that, he walked away, still holding the condom, his cock swaying in front of him.</p> <p>"Come here."</p> <p>She walked to him, facing him in the darkness.</p> <p>"Put it in."</p> <p>"No"</p> <p>"You can have a rubber now."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Put it down," he insisted.</p> <p>"I can't do this in the dark. Come here," he pleaded before pressing his cock to her lips.</p> <p>She didn't resist and she slowly opened her lips, pushing the rubber over the tip of his penis. Slowly, the head slipped inside his mouth, her lips closing around his shaft.</p> <p>"There," he whispered, "that's better."</p> <p>She felt the head begin to disappear inside her mouth.</p> <p>"Don't stop," he urged, "give me more."</p> <p>With little resistance, Dave slowly started pushing inward, sinking the whole of her head inside.</p> <p>"Oh, God yes," she moaned as the head of his cock began to explore her throat.</p> <p>Each time she opened her mouth wider, opening wider to receive him, Dave's cock slid further into her mouth, inch by inch.</p> <p>All his previous inhibitions died at the moment of his first feeling of cock. Now...</p> <p>He couldn't control it anymore.</p> <p>His hands came over her body, sliding up to find her nipples, his fingers pinching and turning them.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she moaned as he slid deeper into her mouth. She was losing her gag reflex and she managed to get his cock completely into her throat. Her lips wrapped around him and she felt his pubic hair scraping against her nose in the darkness.</p> <p>"Mmmm.."</p> <p>As her lips slid up and down his shaft, her tongue lashed against the underside of it. She felt it start to throb in her mouth, a tiny twitch of his cock head.</p> <p>"Oh, that's it. Deeper."</p> <p>She obliged, taking him as deep as she could. Her teeth teased his erection as it ran down her cheek and then his cock fell out of her mouth.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt him come up between her legs, sliding inside her again and then pulling it out again.</p> <p>"Please don't," she begged.</p> <p>Her words were meaningless as his fingers began to fondle her breasts.</p> <p>"I can't. I can't take it anymore. I'll just die there on the floor. Please don't stop."</p> <p>In the darknessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
