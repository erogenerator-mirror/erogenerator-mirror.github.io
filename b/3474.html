Have you had to spank yourself to get into that routine?"</p> <p>I stammered something and gave a fake smile. I had a point, she could always tell when to lie to me, or to play with my toys if I was getting too kinky.</p> <p>"I've already told you that, I'm a little kinky. It's the way I really enjoy getting laid. I don't expect to have an intense sexual relationship before my 30th birthday, and I'm still very much in love with this guy called Gary, but I'm sure that in time, if we're married, I'd love to continue to get the better of you," I said.</p> <p>"That's sweet. But I have a question first. Can we try our new position?" She asked, her eyes on my face.</p> <p>"Sure, if you don't mind?" I responded. "Why do you think I feel the need to punish my wife?"</p> <p>"Well, I can't believe that we are actually trying to make our marriage more fulfilling, and I'd be perfectly happy to start with some punishment, but I can't think of any way in which we can do it while on our honeymoon. And it will have to be very personal and private."</p> <p>"How long will you be out in the middle of the week to work with me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, we'll have to have some time away from our home for our trip." She replied, not giving a hint of regret. I could see that she had given me some insight into what would happen if we couldn't make it to the end of the week. "But I don't want to be a bitch," she said, and she leaned in towards me, kissing me deeply, one arm around my shoulders and the other around my waist, "I just want to be with you."</p> <p>Her lips grazed down to my neck and her hand slipped down to my inner thigh, lightly touching against the thin fabric of my panties, but not touching my sex directly. I could already feel this was going to be extremely exciting. I leaned into her pressing my body against hers, feeling her soft breasts press against my chest with their hard nipples.</p> <p>"Yes! I love you! But I also love the way you fuck!"</p> <p>"I love fucking. Especially when the woman is getting ready."</p> <p>She pulled her hand away and pulled her shirt up over her head. I pulled her close to me by her firm breasts, wrapping my arms around her. There was only one thing that I wanted more than to continue the foreplay. I had to have the two of us, but could we really call it a week? I kissed the tips of her nipples and she started to pull away, but I stopped her from going any farther.</p> <p>"Honey, we have only been there a little more than about two hours, so we need to get ready to leave, if we are going to have any time for all four of us." She said simply.</p> <p>She continued pulling me tight to her, feeling my chest and abdomen. I slipped my fingers inside her jeans zipper, pulling them down, not letting go, and started to gently rub her warm, moist pussy.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that feels really good." She purred. "Don't stop. That's perfect!"</p> <p>Her fingers worked their way inside my panties, tracing my clit, and rubbing against my slit.</p> <p>"And it feels so much better when someone else's fingers are working their magic." She said encouragingly.</p> <p>We started to dance more sexually, I slid my right hand inside her panties, which made her moan, and her hips start to gyrate with the sensual motions of my touch.</p> <p>"Oh, god, this feels good!" she whispered into my ear, her right hand now straying to my neck.</p> <p>I could almost feel her orgasm building in my hand, and she was moaning softly.</p> <p>"I want to feel you cum in my hand soon." I teased her. "Do you want to cum inside me, David?"</p> <p>"Yes! Please do!" I responded, reaching back to caress her smooth stomach instead. "My body is ready."</p> <p>"It'll be fun to have you squirting inside me." She said, her head back against my shoulder.</p> <p>"I'd love to cum inside you, David."</p> <p>"Do it! Do it!" she repeated, leaning closer, planting kisses down my neck, and across my breasts, as her hand trailed down to my pussy. Her lips teased and sucked my nipples as her two fingers danced across my wet pussy. My right hand moved to rub her face and I leaned in to kiss her mouth.</p> <p>"Take off my panties."
