I smiled looking up at her, my expression unreadable. "But for now, I think you know why I won't let you fuck me. You are going to have to wait. I just had to suck off my lover and you have to wait until you get to the other side."</p> <p>"Honey...You can only be in that scenario because of what this is all about." She paused for a moment, putting her arms around his waist and gently kissing his neck. "I can't let you leave until I tell you I love you."</p> <p>"Do we have to?" He asked, looking down at her. He had been about to say that, but then he had seen the look on her face. "I know, it's hard. It isn't even fair how you let me walk away...but this is the only way."</p> <p>"Well I love you too." she said kissing him again, lightly grazing her lips across his neck and across the tip of his hat. Her hand rested lightly around the base of his cock and her fingers lightly stroked it as they kissed.</p> <p>He lifted her chin and looked into her eyes, and she turned her head just slightly to the side. "Well you're in luck then. I can feel something coming up. And you're going to have to finish what you started."</p> <p>She raised her right hand and slowly stroked his cock between her fingers as she kissed him again. Her tongue moved out for a lick then, swirling around the top side of his crown, her long nails scratching him gently. She heard him let out a small gasp and looked up at him as she did this.</p> <p>"I can see that you're going to have to hurry. Don't rush." she smiled and looked over. "The rest of me is going to be waiting for you...I could see it in your eyes."</p> <p>He smiled at her and her hand stopped moving his cock. "It's only your lips." He smiled as his head tilted to meet her lips briefly before opening the door again. "I can't wait." He laughed and they both smiled before he turned to open the passenger door.</p> <p>After they had gotten in, the drive to his apartment was about all quiet. They both knew their lovemaking was about to begin and she decided that she wanted to start off slowly to test him.</p> <p>"You ready?" he asked as he shut the car door.</p> <p>"If you want...do something." She said, reaching for his cock as he turned his head. She kissed him again while his hands roamed her chest and stomach, her fingers combing through his long hair.</p> <p>"Anything." He said softly as she started slowly, his grip firmly on her breasts.</p> <p>"Anything." She said quietly, pulling the top of her sweater up and letting her breasts bounce freely as she kissed his lips, her left hand rubbing his cock through his pants.</p> <p>He pulled out onto the street and turned to look for a building when she spoke up again. "Do you want me to come out this door or should I just stop...I know you don't love me anymore...do you?"</p> <p>"Please...let me go back inside." She begged as he drove.</p> <p>"Honey, I think this is just what some guys would find so attractive. Let me at this end, before you go back into your room and start the night in your pants." He laughed, feeling her nipple hardening as she squeezed him. "But...there is something else I have in mind."</p> <p>"I'm not sure what that is...I just don't know, I guess I'm going to need a few minutes." She said as her hand resumed her stroking action, moving downward between her legs as she began to stroke his cock again.</p> <p>"This... is just where we are getting off to." He said as he drove, his eyes never leaving hers, watching as they drove. His hands ran up her body, stopping with the tips of them just brushing up the outside of the top of her sweater. He felt the heat of her body; she felt his touch so light and his kiss so warm and soft. Her nipples tightened at his touch and she had her hand moving over the head of his cock, cupping it gently.</p> <p>"No...please...Let me turn around or I'm going to cum too soon." She begged again, pulling his hand back down and taking his other hand in her left hand. Her head leaned to one side as she looked back up at him.</p> <p>"That's fine." He said as he put his arm around her and pulled her against him again. His hand found the soft valley between her breasts, his fingers slowly sliding up and down the inside of her right breast as he kissed her neckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
