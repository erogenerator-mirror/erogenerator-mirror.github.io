I was really surprised that she had any idea what sort of pleasure she was getting from the things that a man wanted from her when the opportunity to perform such a thing was at all present. I didn't know where all this was leading with her now.</p> <p>As I was wondering why I was actually getting off so much, my mind began to wander to the things she had said she wanted to do but didn't really need permission to do. What she had said to me the other night was clear to me.</p> <p>"Oh, you really really want to fuck a man?" I asked.</p> <p>"I want to be fucked!" she said. "I just don't want to do a thing with any of the other men that I do go out with for drinks. I just like to have men come in my mouth to eat my pussy. I want another man to come in me and then fuck me.</p> <p>"You wouldn't do that to me," she said. "You would let some other men fuck me for you!"</p> <p>My cock started to stir and I was sure that she had noticed and I couldn't think of any reason why she would be so open to the idea of having another man come in her mouth that way in the heat of the moment and she wouldn't want any of those men to do that to her. It would still be just part of what she had told me about my sexual fetish after all.</p> <p>Maybe in my fantasy that was the real reason that she was actually offering me this experience. I thought that I would let her take on as many men as she wanted and I was so turned on by her being that she had asked me to go and do this. And the way that she looked at me as she took on all of those men that her husband had wanted her to do and I had, to my horror, been so turned on by that of others that I didn't know, so turned on by the idea.</p> <p>"I said yes!" I said. "I'm serious!"</p> <p>"I know," she said. "I really did love to do it. It made me so fucking horny in those few seconds just listening to you tell me how good a fuck you really are and how much you really love it. If you're really that happy with it and you do have a good time too."</p> <p>"I sure didn't do you any harm though," I said. "I really love you. I'm sorry that I did what I was told to do."</p> <p>"I know," she said. "That's part of why I love it so much. I want and need to cum as much as I can and be completely satisfied with each and every one of your orgasms. I also want to do this for you. I like the idea of being your slave."</p> <p>"Doing this for me?" I asked again.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I love the idea of being your slave. And, I would love and need, no more, more than you have a right to give me. I've never been with anyone just for me to do with as I please," she said.</p> <p>"You just let me know what I have done to your body for you," I said. "I guess that this is part of it too. I've never done anyone to do anything to have done to me."</p> <p>"You're just getting started," she said. "I know just how much you love it when I do it. I just want to feel it. I want to know what really feels good and what kind of feeling is like. I know that you would love to do that for me if only I could, but would just want me to do it for you in the way that you want me to? I don't think that I can even go that far."</p> <p>"I could never do it," I said. "I don't even think that it could ever happen. The idea is, once you see the way I feel at the moment, that you can go through with it and have sex with me, that I can have that. I'd just want to feel it."</p> <p>"So, what's happening now?" I asked.</p> <p>"You can watch and learn what feels good for you," she said. "Your mistress will know, and won't want to change anything or make you do anything that you don't feel comfortable doing yourself if you know what's right for you."</p> <p>"I don't know," I said. "I'm just going to sit here for a while and I'll do what ever I can do."</p> <p>Just as we were leaving theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
