I wanted his hard cock inside me – to put it into my pussy with it.</p> <p>We broke the kiss so we could go upstairs.</p> <p>The house seemed very nice. There was a king-size comfortable den chair. The place seemed larger than at many of my house, and the walls were covered with a mural of the sun outside the sun. I sat in the big comfortable chair. He was close by with a strong arm across my shoulders. We faced each other. I was thinking about making love to his cock. I wondered what else he was thinking of.</p> <p>We were still kissing, slowly, gently, when his hand moved up my side and rested on the swell of my breast. He softly but firmly cupped it. He leaned in for a kiss. The next kiss was on my lip. We were still, breathing hard, trying to find something to say.</p> <p>"What?" I asked him.</p> <p>"I just wanted to say that." He said as he cupped my breast again, this time kissing my left nipple lightly. "I want to put my penis in your vagina," he said after a pause. "I want to give you pleasure. I want to make you happy, I want you to enjoy pleasure." He lowered his mouth to my other nipple and he sucked it in.</p> <p>When he was done, I felt as though he was sucking on them long lost and cherished. I had never been with a guy and the thought thrilled me. I didn't know what to do for the next few minutes. What did I feel like right then? I had never known sex to feel good. I had never been with a guy that turned me on. Was there a sexual component to this?</p> <p>I reached down and felt his cock, which was not hard. I squeezed it and heard him moan.</p> <p>"Is it good?" I asked. I was pleased with him.</p> <p>He grinned and looked at me. His lips returned to my nipple, and our fingers joined in the mutual suckling. After a few minutes, the urge to go further in his cock was growing. He had to know we were sexually active, and we could get away with it.</p> <p>"I want your penis inside my vagina," I said.</p> <p>"I want your vagina too. I want your vagina inside of me" he answered. But, I knew what he was thinking, and he had been thinking about it many times before.</p> <p>"Okay," I said, somewhat surprised.</p> <p>He sat up and slid onto the hard, upright seat of the chair. He moved between my legs. I raised them slightly, and he pulled my thighs apart and pushed them toward my chest. He positioned my legs to his shoulders and looked down at my aroused, moist pink flower.</p> <p>His tongue dipped out between my outer and inner lips. Slowly, almost in slow motion. He tasted me on the tip of his very tongue and tasted my excitement against his lips.</p> <p>He licked and sucked in the juices that were oozing up toward his chin. This time, he pulled out some of the fluid, which he used to lubricate the shaft of his penis. As he moved, his fingers were between my legs, and I realized that he was teasing my asshole with his finger. He moved his tongue to my clit and slid first one, then two fingers into my wet vagina. He started at the small, swollen, pink bud and moved his tongue up and down my pussy-lips. His fingers were wet with my flowing lubrication.</p> <p>He stopped and put his face up to mine. His mouth opened. His lips were firm, but moist. His tongue licked my lips and the sides of my mouth. He pulled my face to his. Our kiss lasted several minutes. His head fell back against my tits and he sucked each nipple. He was still only wearing his loose gym shorts and it felt wonderful to be pressed against me like this.</p> <p>His cock was pushing up into me as it touched my belly.</p> <p>He reached around and unclasped my bra. My breasts slipped out of the fabric and the straps moved off my shoulders. He kneaded my breasts. Finally, he pulled my breasts out so the nipples stuck out, then he used his hand to rub my nipples. He pulled my mouth down and kissed me as he reached behind me for his shorts. He pushed them and his shorts and his underwear down.</p> <p>I pulled him close. I grabbed the top of his shorts, pulled them quickly back up—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
