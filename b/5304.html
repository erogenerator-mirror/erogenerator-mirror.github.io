Everyone had a big job and worked hard to support me in it, but no one was talking about missing me. I'm with the same family, but they all came with the same boss, and they left when I was out of school. They even left before I found out anything was going on between us, but I think that if we went through a breakup, a new relationship would have happened. They are great people, so we'll see them when we have more time together." I could feel Sam's gaze on my breasts, and I gave myself a little smile, "How about if you join us for a bit?"</p> <p>"Oh, you mean... you really would let me?"</p> <p>"If the weather is okay, why not, we have a cabin, and it was nice to have both of us with you. In fact, the cabin isn't really a cabin, it's just a large log that was kept in our basement on the top of this roof, and the roof is a beautiful shade of brown." Sam ran a hand along her collarbone as she looked up.</p> <p>"Wow... that is so thoughtful."</p> <p>"Thank you." Sam looked over at the woman I had licked, and I felt a shiver go through me as the idea of having her in my mouth.</p> <p>"I guess we don't have to go all the way if we don't want to."</p> <p>"No, we wouldn't, it'll be nice to just make it with one person." I could feel my already swollen member swell even more at the thought.</p> <p>Sam smiled seductively, the smile that always turned me on. She took off her jacket, and reached down to unzip her pants, before she pulled her panties off entirely, leaving herself completely naked.</p> <p>"Is that what you wanted Sam?" I asked as I looked down over her beautiful, curvaceous body. I leaned down and kissed her lips, "You looked so sweet lying there." I ran a hand up her arm, over her breasts and she giggled.</p> <p>"And you really did make me look so sweet," she said as she ran a finger around my lips, tracing a line through them. Sam slowly rubbed my lips with hers, and I ran my fingers down her chest, across her stomach. My hand reached her mound, and I pulled her down until her wetness just rested against my lips. "Mmm," Sam said, as her hand continued to rub my lower lip.</p> <p>My dick was now straining against my shorts, aching to be freed, as Sam stroked me. "I thought you might like this." She said as she sat back up and leaned in towards me so she could kiss me.</p> <p>I let out a moan as she ran her hands through my hair, "You could keep it like this if you wanted to" She said as she gave it a little tug, "and I wouldn't mind a little taste." I reached out one hand, and stroked my own body. I could feel her body quiver as I did this. I looked at her, my thoughts were running wild, and my dick was hard as a rock. I wanted to have her in my mouth, but didn't know if I should be getting hard or not. I decided on the former anyway.</p> <p>Sam kissed me as our chests pressed together, the air between us causing the friction that only just existed between us. I could just feel the wet kisses through the thin fabric she had on, and the heat of her body. She broke off our kiss and kissed down my neck, leaving a trail of kisses right down my chest. I heard her suck in her breath, and I saw her tongue slip out and tease the tip of my nipple.</p> <p>Sam looked up at me, and smiled before kissing her way down my chest. I arched my back as she moved closer, running my fingers through her long dark hair. She smiled, and moved her face closer, before running her lips up the side of my cock. I felt her hot breath on the underside as she ran her tongue across the head, causing my mind to swirl in more pleasure. I could feel Sam's tongue tracing around the head of my cock, while her hand began to stroke up and down the length of my shaft.</p> <p>Sam leaned back off my body. I could hear her breathing as she worked on my cock, and it was an incredible sensation. I grabbed her head and tried to push her down onto me.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>She giggled and said, "I'll be right back." She got up and ran into the bedroom, I laid on my back and closed my legs.</p> <p>Sam came backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
