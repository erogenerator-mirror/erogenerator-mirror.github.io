I muttered.</p> <p>"No!" she said emphatically. "It hurts a little, and I was afraid you'd really hurt it."</p> <p>"It did," I agreed. "It hurts a lot." I went through mental images and thoughts of what I would do with a girl's body. The more I talked, the more real life I was going to do it. I knew if I ever got her drunk enough it would have to be at least one day a week.</p> <p>I wasn't sure if I'd ever do it. I had a pretty great imagination.</p> <p>I remembered what my dad had said—</p> <p>"Look in a mirror!</p> <p>And it looks like he did!"</p> <p>His words made my heart almost stop. I wondered what he'd been thinking. It was like watching a movie on an adult video tape.</p> <p>He'd asked me, "Just look into your eyes and you're sure?"</p> <p>I knew he'd do it if I looked into my eyes. But for the life of me I couldn't make his thoughts clear. I was having trouble focusing on the action on the movie screen.</p> <p>"Look at my eyes." He said, then put his arm around me.</p> <p>There was a big difference. "And?" I said.</p> <p>"It's like...like he says it's like seeing his face, and I'd...see...my face when....when he puts it...just there, I mean" His words made my heart beat faster.</p> <p>"See your eyes...they're the color...the pupils...and that way the eyes shine...they look like blue pools. And I'd think what if he said that that way, and then that way...." I said, and then looked right back into his eyes.</p> <p>"That's....I don't know," he said. "I just...didn't know. Don't know. If that's what it would be like...."</p> <p>"Yes, look at me," he said. "Look at me when you're in front of you," he said, and I saw him smiling. "You're beautiful. I don't want you to feel pressured to do what I say. You're a girl, and you look like you'll make something wonderful for..." he said, and I saw him move his hand. "And, by some...what do you mean?" He said and I felt his fingers on my neck.</p> <p>"Your neck," he said and I heard a soft sigh. "It was just like...when we kissed, and I didn't feel as if we'd be...like we were supposed to be together. You were special to me, and we had been...in love long before I met you, and I just...I guess, we hadn't...you know, really done things. But I've felt that we...we hadn't...you know, that we'd be...you know, closer than boyfriend and girlfriend..." He said and I felt his warmth.</p> <p>"I don't have to find out...maybe...I'll just go on with the story," he said, not looking at me, not looking away. I was seeing his eyes in the mirror. His face was calm and caring.</p> <p>I don't know how long it took for him to say he'd come to his senses. We hugged again. I felt him against my ribs and I moved my hand between us. "See, you're as beautiful as I remember," he whispered and I felt his fingers on my left cheek and it made me feel as if he was trying to find some way to touch me.</p> <p>I thought for a minute. I didn't really want to go back to what he'd said. It was the wrong thing to do.</p> <p>Why did I think that it was wrong?</p> <p>"Look at me." He said and I did. My eyes followed his fingers, then his face and they were on mine. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. They were as bright as blue pools and I could feel his breath on my face, and I held mine there. "Look at me, and I'll make you feel like a person is supposed to." I whispered and he brought his hand up. A flash of emotion passed over his face when his skin brushed mine, then he was smiling. "Do you feel that?" he asked. I nodded.</p> <p>"That's really nice." He said, and I saw his chest rising and falling and he was breathing more in and out and I felt his hand come up to my cheek. I turned my face and felt how far his leg went between mine. I kept my eyes on his, but I pulled a little closer to him. I'm sure the first thing he said about his sister's face was how pretty and pretty—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
