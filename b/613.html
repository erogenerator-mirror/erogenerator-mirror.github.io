I slid her hand inside mine and wrapped my fingers inside hers. I squeezed her hand tightly and moved my own hand around the back of hers. I found the back of her palm and gently pushed it towards me. I took her hand and placed it in the middle of my own.</p> <p>"Mmm, so soft and warm, like a little hand," I whispered before kissing her softly on the corner of her mouth. My lips were so soft and delicate and she closed her mouth around mine and we kissed. We both knew what was expected of us. I pushed her tongue and her mouth and we kissed deeply. We both relaxed against each other and just enjoyed our time in the warm sun. After a while I started to feel a tingling in my groin. Not unlike how you felt when you were getting off and feeling a warm and erotic climax after it. It was hard for me to control myself.</p> <p>I had one of her legs between my own which was still straddling me. I held on to her leg so she wouldn't move. I could feel she was not uncomfortable. I kissed her neck and pulled more tightly on her hair. I slowly pulled my hand back from where I had been holding her leg and slid my hand inside the thin material of her bikini. I massaged her knee.</p> <p>Once my hand was inside her bikini, I slid all the way up to the side of her mound. I could feel her pussy. She was so soft and smooth that the material was even more so in the warm sun. I could barely feel if the material were a thin sheath. I was gently rubbing the outer lips.</p> <p>She leaned back on my shoulder and I pulled her bikini to one side. She slid down until her body lay full across mine. I could feel her skin against mine. A little more than a half inch separated her pussy from that of my hand. I kept rubbing her. I could feel the heat from her vagina and the moisture of her lips as we lay on the grass.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so embarrassed." She whispered.</p> <p>"Don't be embarrassed."</p> <p>We kissed again. I moved away from her until she could turn over. My face was within inches of hers. I ran my fingertips over her cheek, down to her lips and down her chin again. I lightly kissed her on the mouth again. This time her mouth opened and I gently pulled her back towards me. Our tongues danced together in mutual oral sex. She reached around and began fondling my cock in my swim trunks. It had taken all of my strength not to come right then.</p> <p>My cock was very hard and throbbing in my swim trunks. She reached up and held my balls in one hand and continued to caress and caress the head of my cock. The soft feel of her fingers stroking my cock was a little more exciting than getting a finger deep into my ass.</p> <p>She released her hold on my balls after licking up my shaft and looked up at me with her lustful eyes. I pulled her into another kiss. Our tongues were still exploring each other's mouth. She slowly moved her other hand around to the back of the lounge. I could feel her back starting to arch as she touched the back of the lounge.</p> <p>She had just brought her arm underneath me while I was lying back on the lounge. She wrapped her arm around my lower chest, leaned in and slid her tongue inside my mouth. We kissed again and again as I played with her nipples and she caressed my cock.</p> <p>Finally she broke off the kiss and looked up at me again. I was so hard from having her in my swim trunks and feeling her touch my cock at the same time. She moved her face and lips closer to mine and kissed me again. It was really hot to kiss someone in that moment as we stood there kissing and fondling each other. I gently squeezed her breast between my hands and lightly pinched her nipple with my fingers. She moaned and moved her body closer to me. She gently rubbed the front of my swim trunks. Her fingers moved inside the waistband of the swim trunks and wrapped around my hard cock.</p> <p>I pulled away from her, took her into my arms, and carried her back into our house. We walked to my bedroom in the warm afternoon sun. She got down on the bottom of the bed and I moved between her legs. I slid her bikini top down her shoulders until it lay on the top of the pile. I took off her bottoms and set them on top of the pile as I pulled her close to me again.</p> <p>I pressed my face against her stomach and looked at her pussy. I could feel that the fabric of her bikiniâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
