You have really grown up here and I appreciate the company." Sarah blushed. "But, I haven't gotten to do anything to the place for years. There's a girl who I know who has really grown into a really nice person, but she doesn't know it yet."</p> <p>"I think she is a good person, too."</p> <p>"I mean, she's been great, to give us a chance to talk about anything except just getting to know one another. You've been in my life from the beginning."</p> <p>Sarah smiled, "I'm glad we bumped into each other again."</p> <p>"I'm glad she does too."</p> <p>Sarah was walking toward a door and the one on the other side called out, "Come on, you're coming,".</p> <p>They both looked as they heard a car pull into the driveway. Two more cars pulled into the garage and three or four of the occupants got out of the cars. One of the occupants had a look on his face waiting for them with his arms crossed and the other got out quickly. "Uh, Sarah?"</p> <p>Looking over her shoulder, Sarah said, "Just come in, they don't want to hurt you,".</p> <p>Sarah walked over to the entrance and saw someone standing on something and a man standing there by the door. Sarah saw the man look back at her and turn to his man in the same suit. He nodded.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Sanders, but we just don't think we have your back?"</p> <p>Saying nothing, the man turned and walked toward the door. Sarah heard two of the door handle on the other side open and close. The door opened and closed and a door on the other side closed. "Mr. Sanders, how may I help you?"</p> <p>"I'm here about this place."</p> <p>"Yes, well, I've been trying to reach you, but I can't get a hold of any one right now. May we get on with what we want to know."</p> <p>"We've been in here for almost two hours. We do talk though."</p> <p>"But maybe a little privacy wouldn't be a problem."</p> <p>"You could still leave your door unlocked."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, but it would be really dangerous for me to just come in here."</p> <p>He shook his head, "It would look dangerous when someone leaves their door open."</p> <p>"You'd have to knock, I guess," looking at him.</p> <p>The man on the other end of one of the doors opened and said, "Thank you," as he turned toward Sarah with the door.</p> <p>"It's my own business, I don't know where the woman might have got the key."</p> <p>He shook his head. "Would you go back to your office, please?"</p> <p>Sarah's face flushed with embarrassment as she stepped away from the door.</p> <p>The man in the suit and some of the other people in the room looked at her. "I'm really sorry about your husband. Please don't talk and try to leave me alone," he said. He had some difficulty staying on his feet as he walked, but eventually stopped.</p> <p>"Is everything ok?"</p> <p>"Yes, I just wanted to say how nice it is to meet you. I'm a computer engineer, so it's nice to have someone to talk to, especially after all those years."</p> <p>"I don't need to do anything. The phone is fixed."</p> <p>He looked at Sarah and said, "I'm glad you came right out with me. My friend in the office says this place is a great place for people to meet," as he walked off toward the back of the room. He paused, looked back and continued, "Mr. Sanders, it would be helpful if you came to dinner sometime."</p> <p>"Thank you, but I'm afraid I'm only going to be by myself," looking toward the door, "maybe we could meet some time?"</p> <p>She felt like her heart pounded in excitement. "Please, you probably think it would be a bad idea getting a second chance to get married if your old man hasn't been taking you out on a real date."</p> <p>He nodded as he looked around and said, "The last time he was doing that was probably not long enough for me, but I'll follow your train of thought. Anyway, it wasn't as much of a date as my wife. It just happened that he'd just turned twenty, so this was something we had to catch up."</p> <p>"Well, I can always find someone to do it for me, if you want."</p> <p>"No way!"</p> <p>"Come on, my friend said you could use my help." He stopped and turned away from Sarah and extended his hand sayingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
