It ended as an expression on her face, a look of shock and confusion. As she took a step back, I turned to the man she was looking at.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I'd hate to..." The line left his face. Then she continued to her friends, "Yeah, well, I'll take care of things..." She paused, then continued to the men in the other room. "But I'm still so pissed off at him that I can't stand to talk about him anymore. You've still got me, if we can get the little whore back."</p> <p>Caleb looked a bit surprised to have this in front of him. "I don't know what to say, I don't like him, I really don't."</p> <p>"I know, you're crazy. But I'm not mad. You should have heard me when we were in the men's room. I was telling him that I was going to talk to him about us... about us fucking. And then I told him to leave. But I swear he just stood there with that big shit eating grin on his face and he just said, 'No, don't do it with him again.' So we had sex two more times before he gave me a ride home.</p> <p>"It was fun, a lot of fun, and a lot of fun to watch, but when he caught me with one more guy in the backseat that night, he just said he had to know why and where I was going. And we had it all. How can you say that you've never been with a man you did that in... years?" The man was clearly uncomfortable talking about this with this girl, but she still had a point there.</p> <p>"Well... you can tell me, I'm not that great of a friend."</p> <p>"You didn't ask, I have."</p> <p>"I know. I meant what I said at the end."</p> <p>She shrugged, "See, I'm no better than the few guys he knew. We just weren't like you, this way." When she spoke like that, I think she was flirting with him, and I wasn't sure she was. I mean I'd known that she probably would have been and I didn't know what to think.</p> <p>"Well I'm not going to ask more of them. And you're not that great of a guy."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>We finally reached her house. She led the way inside with me in the middle. "So are we about done then? How about something we had last night?"</p> <p>She pulled me to her, "I want you to know something I've been wanting to tell you for months."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She pulled her shirt off over her head. I could see some of her bare back, even through her clothes. Her shirt went next. She put her arms in the air and thrust her breasts at me as she pulled my shirt up and off over my head. "Don't get me wrong, I've got a thing for older guys," she laughed. "And I want to do it too. As long as it isn't too late. And just say when we get home."</p> <p>She sat on the couch that took up most of the arm and a half of the kitchen, facing me. "I think you just have to get over, I don't think I'll ever get the nerve to tell you about my past." I could see a little smile creep onto her lips. "So I'm going to start out with things that might sound really silly and crazy, like what happened when you were going down on me. Then if you're sure you want to, maybe you can tell me about itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
