Her voice was calm and collected.</p> <p>"Rules?" I asked. I didn't like the sound of that.</p> <p>"You'll see." She replied.</p> <p>As I looked through my fridge, I saw two bottles of beer - both white, one red. She set hers down, and as soon as I was satisfied that she hadn't put on a show of her own, she slipped out of her clothes and climbed onto me. "Eat it, stud!" she pouted. She kissed me, and as she did, I felt her tongue sliding along my tongue, and as it did, she opened the bottle of beer and took a swig. I put my free hand on her breast, which was rock hard. I could feel her growing wetter by the moment.</p> <p>She lifted her eyes and kissed me deeply, and I could taste herself still on the inside of her mouth. I brought my right hand around to caress her breast. Her nipple was bigger than I'd fantasized and her aureole seemed puffy. She groaned loudly as I squeezed her breast. She let my finger enter her mouth, sucking the beer out.</p> <p>"Mmm, this is good," she said around the beer bottle.</p> <p>She moved into me, pressing against me. We were both breathing hard. She rubbed her nipple against me, and I lifted my butt so she could grind into me. I lifted my hips and pulled her down onto me. She could feel how hard against me, she could still feel how soft. I could feel how wet I was becoming for me, the fabric of her skirt was rubbing my legs, and she moaned. My hard-on throbbed against my pants and she looked down at it, as if questioning whether or not she'd got me erect. I was sure she'd seen me masturbate once, while looking at herself in the mirror. But she never spoke, but her tongue was deep in my mouth, and hers was working my tongue. She had both hands behind my head, pulling me into her, and she squeezed my breasts. It was the most intense feeling of our lives, and she'd never done this before. She moaned as she kissed me more and sucked faster, grinding her hips against me. I'd never thought of this in my wildest fantasies. And to think, I'd been dreaming about her.</p> <p>We were both breathing hard. I could feel the wetness of our pussies as she ground against me, both hands squeezing her breasts, and her nipples were hard. We were both moaning, in a language of lust. She was moving so fast, I almost fell out of the chair, and as she came, she pressed against me a little harder, and I heard her moan. I was right on the edge between her and the chair, and she pressed me into it and held me there as she came again and again. I could feel her pussy pressing out and rubbing against me. She moved her hands down to my ass, where I started rubbing her and she pushed against me again. I could feel the wetness around my cock and as she started to move against me, she moved her finger into me. I arched and moaned some more, still holding onto the arm that she'd used earlier. She groaned and came again, this time even stronger, moaning softly, moving back against me, grinding her hips onto me. She groaned and pressed hard against me, and then slowed and held onto me, and I gasped and she moved slowly, pulling her head away from mine but letting my shoulder sink to the chair back.</p> <p>She pulled my hand to her face, kissing her fingers, moaning again, and she pushed the fingers into my mouth, and then moved her hand over my mouth and chin and up to my neck, pressing her wet fingers down to the hollow, where my shoulders curved. She moved slowly, not wanting to stop. It felt so beautiful, so different from what she had been doing with her fingers. She moved her wet finger along my collarbone, just barely brushing my right nipple. I moaned. She did the same to the left one, feeling the heat in my neck on her body. The tip of her wet finger was rubbing my chin now and I started to move my upper body to rub her, too.</p> <p>"You like that?" she murmured.</p> <p>"It's a good position, I think."</p> <p>I could feel her hand moving down my neck, then her fingers tracing along the outline of my chest. I knew where it was going and I could feel my own heart beating, and I could feel myself dripping. I couldn't stop the movements of my hands. I couldn't believe I could do this.
