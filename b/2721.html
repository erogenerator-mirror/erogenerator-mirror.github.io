They were all dressed in just slacks and slippers and had an umbrella and sun hat. They stopped when they saw the approaching group of seven and took up positions at its umbrella. Both girls were wearing teddies and high heels, so they wore ankle sandals with matching high heels. They were all wearing a white knee-length sun dress and sandals, so they were wearing sandals. The girls had obviously been practicing for a long time. They had been living together for several months, and just seemed to get more and more comfortable, as they took to the water freely.</p> <p>It took all of us a minute or so just to recognize that the girls were nude. I think they knew we knew, too. They all had a good sense of propriety and modesty. We all sat around talking or just watching, and had little or no idea what to do or say. Finally, after about fifteen or twenty minutes, the girls asked, "So, honey, could we all like get started on something else? Do you, too, Steve, get undressed?" The guys all nodded, and then, one by one, stripped down to their boxers. The girls sat around and played cards on the big, comfy cushions. After a few minutes, the girls asked us to stay for a while, to wait until everyone was naked, so we did. We watched all of the action and had a good time, drinking beer, drinking beer and dancing. At one point, I got a call from Steve on the phone and told him, "Hey, honey, I've got an offer you have to make, and I'd be willing to give a shot if we could meet a group of about six people who have gotten to know their new friends." I asked, "And you're not so sure about sharing them with me?"</p> <p>He laughed and replied, "I know, buddy, but I think they're getting to know and appreciate us." We all agreed that they deserved to work together and that they might be a good addition to the group, if they wanted to do so. I got the call back, and Steve offered us a beer. We left the table and headed down to the deck. When we got to the cabin, we found that there was a lot of empty chairs, so some of the girls spread out some lawn chairs, which are the best seats where we could all sit comfortably. Steve told me that it might be a good opportunity to go and find four more girls, but I said fine. We were at the end of the deck, getting out a good drink. We were talking as we were about our future prospects. After our second beer, we all decided to call it a night and lay down for a night of rest. We all slept well.</p> <p>Next morning, as I was getting dressed, I asked Becky, "Do you think you might be able to do something to keep me from sleeping, tonight?" She replied, "It wouldn't be right to make fun of you or your friend, so we thought we'd just have dinner. We also think our friends might have something that is in your favor after all." I agreed and we headed off to the restaurant. As we parked in the restaurant parking spot, Becky suggested that we share the table. I smiled and then asked my mother if she minded if I came, knowing that a bunch of us might be watching her. She asked if I minded, as it might do me some good to get out of here without all of us leaving the house. I thought that that would probably be a good thing.</p> <p>After we had our food and another beer in our hand (I hoped to get some more later), our next destination was our cabin. When we got there, we parked next to the door, got our bags (I put the food in the trunk), and went inside. We had plenty of room in the kitchen, so we both went in and put all of the food and our stuff into the fridge, while we still had things in the bedroom. When we returned, we went to the living room. I brought up a good movie so we could watch it. As he started it, I could tell that my mother's eyes were as big as saucers and she was not very happy to see that we were now watching it. Steve came over to me and said, "Hey, buddy, how about joining us for pizza?" We both agreed that would be great and we went for another beer and some dinner. After we finished our dinner, we decided to watch something that started off about twenty minutes before the start of the second movie. When we returned to watching the movie, Becky came and sat next to me on the couch, but did not say a word. She turned to me and putâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
