I said as I jumped into the tub.</p> <p>We lay there in the tub, our hands working over each other's body, kissing and caressing each other, just enjoying the warmth and feeling of the water wash over our tired bodies.</p> <p>"Wake up and go to sleep" I whispered, kissing her lips and nose, "we have a long night ahead of us."</p> <p>Mae was out of the tub before I could even begin but when I opened my eyes she was lying back against the side of the tub, with her arms up to her head, and looking up at me lovingly, eyes closed. Her legs were spread wide and her feet were propped on the tub edge. She was looking up at me, like an angel, smiling.</p> <p>I kissed her forehead and gently opened her eyes. Her lips were red and swollen and her eyes were wet and glazed over with excitement. She reached for my hand and I stood and led her back into the bedroom and out into the hallway, to my suite.</p> <p>When I closed the door behind us and turned toward her, she gave me a passionate kiss that promised all the things she had. Her hands were all over me but she couldn't touch me where she hoped she could. She was panting and trembling, with excitement of what she was about to do.</p> <p>My lips were wet with her and my tongue slid across her lips, across her chin, then down to where she wanted it. Mae kissed her with long deliberate strokes like a practiced slave. She reached behind her, grabbing my cock as she pulled, and pulling it, hard, into the softness of her ass.</p> <p>I lifted her and spun her around, then pushed her toward the head of the bed, her legs hanging over the corner and her face above the edge with her butt wiggling in the air. Her wet skin slapped against it a few times, then her hands were behind her. I slid between her legs, pushing them apart as I did so. I wanted to see her, the most beautiful, most beautiful creature I had ever met.</p> <p>My cock was pressing firmly against her crotch and I could feel it against her pussy lips, sliding up along the slit and pressing gently against her clit. Mae was groaning deeply and I could feel her nipples harden into hardened points.</p> <p>I lifted her butt up and slid the wet silk of her panties over her hips. I slid her up the bed until it was at her waist, then slid down and slid the silken garment over her legs and off her feet, throwing it aside. It was then I turned her around and kissed her deeply, slipping my tongue into her mouth and exploring hers, as I slid my fingers lightly across every inch of her body.</p> <p>She was writhing and squirming underneath me and I wanted to show her that I knew how to please a woman. I pulled her toward me, slipping my cock between her lips. I heard her suck in her breath at the first contact but then, after a moment or two, she began to kiss her, as I slid my tongue deeper, pushing against her soft lips and working up toward her clitoris.</p> <p>Mae's body began to tense and her breathing was coming out in hard short gasps, as my tongue slithered inside of her and I sucked on it, then I reached down with my finger and gently pressed it against her slit, making it slick and swollen with her juices. I slid it up and down, across her clit as I slid my finger over it, trying to get her to rub it along with mine.</p> <p>Mae was moving against my tongue, trying to make myself more aware of the feeling of the wetness that was covering my finger. I felt her muscles begin to clench a little, and I took that as my signal that I had reached my tipping point. It was only a matter of moments until Mae's legs began to shake in uncontrolled spasms, and I felt her juices flow over my finger and into me, coating my fingertip.</p> <p>I was surprised at the force and the pressure coming from her as her legs went stiff and almost came off the bed. I held her close, then rolled her over just enough for her to lay on the bed beside me, facing me, her face only inches from mine. I slid my fingertip down across her lips and around the tender bud of her clit, while kissing her deeply.</p> <p>Mae began to moan and move faster, moaning, "oh yes, oh god yes. Oh yes!" as her head lolled.</p> <p>"Shh, it's OK. Oh no you don't! Your thing is all wet and slippery. Oh yes, god yes! Oh god yes!" Mae was now moving much faster, pressing her face into the bed and arching her back.
