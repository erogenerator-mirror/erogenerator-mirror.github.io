I had no idea that was possible."</p> <p>"Well, you know I've been thinking a lot about you," she told me. "I guess if I wanted to I could come to see you every so often."</p> <p>I smiled and said, "I've thought about being here for a long time."</p> <p>"I know," she said, "but you'd better come and see me tomorrow."</p> <p>"Ok," I said.</p> <p>Sue came over to me while I was working a wheelbarrow. We hugged. "There's nobody here," she said.</p> <p>"I think I'll be a happy camper," I said. "How's New England?"</p> <p>"It sure is," Sue said. "What's that all about?"</p> <p>"The town is in the middle of nowhere, isn't it?"</p> <p>"No, sir, there's nothing else," Sue said. There seemed to be an uneasy tension as we all got out of the truck and walked together toward the house.</p> <p>When we got to the house, Sue was out front and the lights were on in the sitting room, a very nice bedroom that seemed so cool and serene compared to the sitting room we had been in for the last four months, and the bathroom was like one of those rooms that you can see out of the window in the living room. She had just removed the curtains when I joined her in the sitting room. I was feeling kind of awkward, but Sue said it was for me, so I sat down and tried not to stare too much.</p> <p>"I'm sorry that we didn't make the first move," I told her.</p> <p>"We had to, too. Just stay quiet until I get my chance." Sue sat on the sofa and then I took her into my arms. I kissed her lightly, then her lips, first a peck, and then she opened her mouth and we had our first taste of each other's lips. I put my hands on her cheeks as our tongue met and she squealed into my mouth. She reached down and found my cock hardening right away. "Oh," she said, her hands running through my hair, "I love it like this."</p> <p>"I guess, I guess I'm not the only man who has the equipment to satisfy a woman," I said.</p> <p>I kissed her neck while she put her hands to my belt and pants, working it through the zipper. I was surprised when she grabbed all the underwear that was at my ankles and pulled my pants and underwear down. As soon as my cock was free she was stroking it and squeezing it with one hand. Sue pushed her leg against my leg as she leaned over and sucked on my dick. My head tipped back and an almost painful feeling filled my body as I realized that she was going to take me into her pussy. "Oh, God," I screamed as she fucked me with her bare leg. She moved her mouth up to my ear, and I pulled her up so that we were kneeling on the sofa. Her pussy was so wet, I could feel it slide against my shin as she moved with me, and I could feel her moving. I'd never felt anything like that before, but suddenly I came in her without the slightest touch she took with me. She shuddered, and her moans were muffled by my cock in her mouth.</p> <p>"Wow!," I said. I was lying on the sofa, trying to make sure that I wasn't leaking any of my cum. The first time that happened with a guy it was amazing, but that wasn't the first time it had even been with a woman, and this was something I hadn't had the experience of with a woman before. She didn't move, but she kept sucking on my cock, and my sperm seemed to be flowing from the corner of her mouth. I think she thought that I would be okay, considering mine looked as raw as mine felt.</p> <p>"I think I came a lot," she finally said. "I never did like to do that much if I did that."</p> <p>"I don't blame you," I said. "I'm surprised I can manage that."</p> <p>"You don't have to," Sue said. She moved my shirt up and off, exposing my flat chest. "I don't want to tell you how much I enjoyed it." When she looked at me I was shocked. There was no expression in her face. Sue's hands were still all over my chest, gently pinching and pulling on my nipples while we kissed, looking straight into each other's eyes. Once she got to my mouth she sucked and licked her lips until everything became shiny. "You're so beautiful," she said. "It's hard not to stare at you all night.
