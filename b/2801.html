I shouldn't have said anything. It's just that..."</p> <p>The man nodded. "It's okay. I promise."</p> <p>The man put his hand down, stroking her face. "I can't believe it. It's been almost three years. I just never thought that you would have the nerve to go through with it."</p> <p>"You shouldn't have to," she said, taking his hand and putting it on her cheek. "It's because I've been with this man for just over a year. You know what I was really thinking? I wasn't really sure about dating any men. I was hoping he would have taken me, but he never did."</p> <p>He leaned forward, his mouth coming down on hers. Their kiss grew passionate as the man's tongue danced with her own. He took her hand, and put it over his cock. She couldn't believe how big. She wasn't sure that she would be able to wrap her hand around it. He stroked her hand a few times, and then pushed her hand down. She felt him spread her legs, and his cock began to swell inside her. He put his hand behind her head, and he kissed her again. She had never been kissed that way before, and it turned her on very much. She broke from his embrace, and the man took his place between her legs. "Are you ready?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Hell yeah. Just make me hurt."</p> <p>He laughed as he put his hand on her back, and pulled her down into his lap. He looked into her eyes. "Do you trust me?"</p> <p>She nodded her head. "I promise you, I don't think I'll ever cheat on Jack again."</p> <p>He chuckled. "Are you sure? About anything?"</p> <p>She nodded her head. "Absolutely. Please don't try and change anything. All I'll say is it's okay to do this, and to you."</p> <p>He smiled. "Very nice," he said. "And you're the most beautiful woman I've ever been with." He kissed her again. "All yours."</p> <p>She laughed. "Okay."</p> <p>He helped her to the bed, and she lay back. She reached down and spread her legs open. "Do what I tell you, Tom," she said.</p> <p>He lay down, and slid his fingers in. He felt her warmth as he stroked her with his fingers, exploring her until she had a series of small orgasms in her fingers. She was enjoying herself, when he rolled over her, his cock pushing against her leg. She wrapped her legs around him, not caring what she looked like. She wanted him inside her, and wanted him to do what he was doing just ten minutes ago. She moved down, and took his cock where she could get it. He felt the warm wetness of her lips on the head, and he took in a deep breath as he felt her lips wrap around the head of his cock. It was so big. So thick. There wasn't anything he could do to hold back, and he didn't need any more of a warning. He felt the tightness that made him come in her mouth, and he couldn't hold it back either. The man in her mouth had let go a lot of his pent-up control on her. Allowing her to take every inch of him.</p> <p>He felt the spasms of his orgasm, and he felt hers around him, waiting for it to end. But instead of stopping, it started to fade. He was afraid he'd blown his wad prematurely. He held in his last groan, hoping that was over. "That was fantastic, Mary," he said, and kissed her again.</p> <p>Mary took his hand and placed it on her mound. He touched her lips, parted them, and pushed his finger inside. She was soaking wet, and didn't protest at all. He slid to the side, until he could get his legs underneath him. He held his cock against her as he pushed inside of her. She was so tight, so wet, he couldn't control himself. It felt so good to be so filled. Mary had never wanted everything as much as she wanted him to fill her. He looked into her eyes as he pushed in and pulled back, until he felt the skin of his cock pressing against the tip of her hole. She moaned.</p> <p>"You're so tight," he said in a husky voice. "You're gonna break me, Mary."</p> <p>That really hurt. He tried to say it was okay, but it seemed so dirty to ask him to do it back. It was just dirty like he had always done it, or like it now as a woman does it once in a while. Now, she was screaming, begging. He could imagine him fucking her with her nails. It felt so wrongâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
