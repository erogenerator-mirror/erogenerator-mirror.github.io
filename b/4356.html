They had been through their own problems and were both now back on track. They knew they both were in need of a good fuck and a really good cum.</p> <p>They stood back and looked at each other, as she stood up. She took the condom off and opened it. Her fingers started slowly caressing his cock, which responded with a full-on erection almost immediately. After a few minutes she had him lie down on the bed, propped on one elbow and started slowly lowering herself onto him. From the look on her face and body language, she knew that this was the best fuck she could get. The fact that she had been doing this for so long made that even better. As she slowly lowered herself until they were perfectly positioned she began rubbing the head of his cock with her clitoris, which elicited an orgasm in him and set a pattern for them that would ensure an even better fuck to follow soon. Her clitoris, however, was not the only way to trigger the orgasm that would follow for either of them: she had a cock up her ass.</p> <p>The feeling inside of her caused her to reach orgasm in a heartbeat. She started to move up and down on him. His cock was not as big as hers, but it was a beautiful piece of flesh nonetheless. It didn't take long for her to reach her second orgasm. She knew this would come sooner than later.</p> <p>When it was over, she rolled to the side and put her legs together to rest a moment before she climbed off of him and went to stand beside him on the bed.</p> <p>"You guys have been in the same bed, haven't you?" Tom had been looking back at her and trying to look at the same time this time as they both noticed that Tom had a slightly-on-up smile on his face.</p> <p>"Yes we did," Lisa replied, "And we had a great time. But we didn't have much time to ourselves. There are plenty of ways we can be alone."</p> <p>"What would you like to be with?" Tom grinned, obviously wanting to join them now that they were both naked and on the bed, which in a way was still and open.</p> <p>"Oh I know where to go." Lisa said with a smile. "But I just want to be on top. I want to try riding you for real. I love it when we go cowgirl."</p> <p>"Really?" Tom said. "I'll put the condom on and hold on for a few seconds."</p> <p>"Absolutely," Lisa smirked, "I'll go over to your room to change and I'll take my shower. There's no hurry, but we have already done a lot of work tonight, so it would be a bit of fun for me to take it for you myself while you lie there."</p> <p>"Okay, I'd love to watch you shower." Tom said.</p> <p>"Well why don't we get you ready. We still have an hour or so." Lisa winked again and began to get dressed.</p> <p>Tom was still a little stunned by what he had just heard and hoped didn't include the sex that was now absolutely necessary for himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
