He was aching to do something and my feet ached as I sat on the edge of his bed. I knelt down and placed my lips on his. He moaned and raised his hips and I took his penis in my mouth. His shaft seemed to swell and he pushed his hips forward. I ran my tongue around the tip and flicked my tongue on the underside. I sucked him into my mouth as he thrust forward again, fucking my mouth as his fingers tangled in my hair. His breathing became heavier as he kissed me and then his hips pressed forward again, fucking my mouth once again, moaning as my teeth scraped his skin. "Damn," he gasped, "You are good,"</p> <p>I moaned around him as I let him slip from me and he looked at me with lust in his eyes. "I'll take care of you," I said with a grin and I lifted myself, my wetness dripping down my thighs. "What do you think?" he asked excitedly. "I think you have a nice cock! I can stroke it, if you want," I said and I straddled the bed. I lay back on his bed with my arms down either side of me to expose my breasts and his erection. He knelt at the edge of the bed and he grabbed my panties and I wriggled out of them, handing them to him. His eyes were wild looking as he took them from me and then he smiled as he raised them from my skin; they were too tight and would take forever to get rid of. He licked them, one at a time, one at a time as he stared at them and then kissed them before turning to me. He kissed me first, sucking the tip and then kissing me hard again and thrust into me as he moaned into my neck. "Oh, yeah, that's good," I moaned as he entered me for the first time. He pumped my wet slit with his long shaft; I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him long and deep. He moaned as he fucked me hard and deep, slamming into me with each thrust.</p> <p>"Harder, I'll come!" I whispered in his ear as he fucked me and I bit into his shoulder. I cried out when I felt his cock spurt and flood me with its warm load. He came for hours afterward, panting as he collapsed forward onto me. I pressed my lips against his as he kissed me, his cum still dribbling down my thighs, his penis flaccid inside me.</p> <p>"I love you," I whispered as he caressed my face. I felt him soften inside of me and he smiled. "That was fantastic,"</p> <p>"It was fantastic," I agreed, "I'll treasure every second,"</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The next weekend was spent in the office. Michael would be in meetings all day and it would stay that way until Wednesday when all the staff members would be gone. I knew that his trip would be interesting, which I always wanted. "I'm sure," I smiled as I sipped my wine, "you'll be thrilled, I promise." I looked out the window and saw Michael. He would be alone for several days but was going back to his room when he left Friday. I smiled at him and he turned to me. "This is a great idea, I've been looking forward to it as long as I can,"</p> <p>"That's good to hear," I replied smiling. I got up and slipped on the robe that I had on. "I'll see you later," I stood there for a second holding out my hand to let him look at me. "Do we have time?"</p> <p>"No," he laughed. "Come on, I have to get to bed,"</p> <p>I smiled; I walked him to the door and opened it for him. He was to follow quickly and I turned and closed the door.</p> <p>"Don't let me scare you, I'm only 20 and I'm married," I said with a laugh and turned to leave. "I don't want to be caught," I said to myself as I stood there.</p> <p>I walked slowly down the hallway that led to his room and was stopped just before he was in the room. I sat on his bed and watched him as he stood on the bed. The muscles of his arms were hard and he was wearing a shirt, I didn't know why. I watched his face as he approached me and he wrapped his arms around me as he kissed me, his body pressed hard into mine, his erection making its presence known. I pulled him close, his body soft against mine and he lowered himself to me. He held me close to him as he kissed me.</p> <p>"You look great tonight," he said softly when the kiss ended.</p> <p>"Good," I sighed. He pushed me up with his arms and I layâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
