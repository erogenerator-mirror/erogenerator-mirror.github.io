Do you want to come with me?" she asked him, looking into his eyes with an impish smile on her own.</p> <p>"I want to. Lead the way."</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>That weekend, he woke alone in his bed, but not alone. He felt the blood rush to his head and he knew why. He was awake and he couldn't remember where he was. His ears and eyes were still tender from his orgasm, but he could smell the coffee on his bedside table, a slight scent of cinnamon and musky cologne.</p> <p>He had never done anything this sexual, but he thought it had gone far enough. He decided to get up and start packing and getting ready for work, knowing that his new job would require a bit of work and he had no intention of getting one of those. He had come around to the conclusion that he should be using his hands to relieve his frustrations, instead of his mind.</p> <p>He turned to find Beth at the table, leaning against it again, her head cocked with a look of interest. Her hazel eyes had a look of confusion. "I'm sorry for all the trouble, but you said you had to work?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I do. But, I'll do it," he said, "But, first I need to check out some of the paperwork I need from a contract. Can you take a look at that?"</p> <p>"Certainly, Sir," she said, and took a look at the contracts on the sheet. "That's everything, I don't know about you, but I can't wait any longer." She put her hand on her shoulder and stood up. "Thank you so much, Sir."</p> <p>"Yes, you're welcome, Beth. I want you to help me sign the contracts tomorrow while I work over there." He reached for her hand and led her to the door.</p> <p>"Now, be safe." She looked up at him and smiled. "Please come back to our dorm tomorrow. I may have you over." She kissed his cheek and left the room.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>He heard a noise from the other side of the dorm and turned around to find his roommate lying on his bed, wearing a nightgown. As he looked over him, Beth's head dipped between her arms. "I'm sorry Sir, I really can't get the sleep. But thanks for thinking of me."</p> <p>"That's alright, I'm sure you're quite capable of sleeping." He laughed and shook his head. "Nope, I can't stay awake just watching you sleep."</p> <p>"I slept alright, Sir. I was just tired." Her nightgown was pulled up by her arms and she looked as if she had slept for hours, her breathing still coming in short gasps.</p> <p>"I'll walk you over to your hotel, it's not far."</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, as she stood up and stretched, then moved to her side of the bed to get on. At this point, he decided to keep it short and just hang out for a bit. "Goodnight, Sir," she said, and closed the door. "Night, Sir Knight," she said and walked over to her door.</p> <p>"Night, Beth." he called as he unlocked it and looked back at her. "Good night, Beth." He turned to see a large grin on her face and she walked back towards her doorway, turning her back to him as she closed her door again.</p> <p>He was silent for a few moments and then began to get up. "Hey, do you want to get back to it?"</p> <p>"Not at all. I'm tired. Please stay here, I'll make myself at home as usual." She smiled, turned to walk towards her room. He reached out to turn on the lamp.</p> <p>"Not a problem," he said as he walked into hers. "Do you need to work?" she asked. He turned around to return the light to him.</p> <p>"I'm on my way back, Sir. Be up very early tomorrow." He turned around and she watched him walk out towards the door, and she heard him walk outside in the night. She turned around to look at him.</p> <p>"Thanks, Sir Knight."</p> <p>"No problem," he replied cheerfully. * * * * *</p> <p>That evening, he made him coffee and they watched TV together in front of the closed door. It was early, but she had to go out again to do some shopping. She was a few minutes late, getting dressed, and a few minutes after, he knocked on the door, asking for her presence.</p> <p>"Come through, Sir Knight." he entered the door and she looked at him smiling.
