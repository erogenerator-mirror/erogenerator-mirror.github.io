Then she looked back up at me and said, "I bet you were getting nice-bye!"</p> <p>"Mmm...thanks for offering to share this with me," I said honestly, then grinned shyly. I looked down and she looked back up to me, smiling, then turned and went to her car. She turned to me and said, "Have a good time. We'll see you next week."</p> <p>"I'll be ready when you are," I replied, smiling at her.</p> <p>"Promise?" she whispered as she walked toward me.</p> <p>"I promise!" I replied back, getting to my feet.</p> <p>"Good. Have a good time. Your wife is just as awesome as she was in her day." She leaned in, then kissed me lightly on the lips. She backed away and said, "That's one reason why we had such a good time. She couldn't have been more hot than me either."</p> <p>With that comment, she walked toward me, slowly moving her hips in a way I could see the lips of her shaved pussy. I watched as she turned so that her ass was near my face, then slowly pushed it down on the couch between us. When she stood and turned me, I looked her in the eye and then kissed her. As our tongues touched, I felt the warmth of her body on me, and saw that she wasn't wearing a skirt. "Would you like that?" I asked softly.</p> <p>"I'd love that!" she replied, giving me a sexy, sweet smile. "Wouldn't we both?" she said as she slowly, teasingly stepped back towards me, giving me a view from the doorway. "I suppose it would be my turn to see how far I can take things!"</p> <p>With that, she turned around, sliding her panties aside, and lowered herself on to the couch, allowing her legs to drop to the floor, exposing herself to me. "I suppose there's a first for everything," she stated.</p> <p>After she had her feet below my cock, she leaned toward me and said, "That's one thing we haven't done before."</p> <p>As she leaned for me, I reached out and touched her cheek, and she took my hand, and pushed it toward her pussy. Holding it there, she slowly lowered herself onto the couch, taking my hand in hers. She was breathing hard as she lowered herself on my cock, gasping as I slid deep into her.</p> <p>"God Damn, you felt just as good as you did!" she gasped. "We were always good together, but now...I can't get over this! Are you getting close to blowing? Did you touch me?" she asked between gasps.</p> <p>"No! Not yet!" I replied, then kissed her deeply. "I have to keep my tongue away from doing that to your pussy."</p> <p>She kissed me back, slowly sliding more and more of her tongue in and out of my mouth, as she began sliding up and down my cock. After a minute of this, she began moving faster, then began to slide back down on my shaft. My hands were on her hips as I watched her, watching my cock slide in and out of her pussy. She leaned back into me, looking over her shoulder at me and then her eyes closed. "Mmm...your cock feels good," she said, as she kissed me again.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed tight as she rode me, her arms on her waist, her fingers running through my hair as she ran her fingers through it. I could feel her muscles tightening as they contracted and loosened. "Ohhhhhh..." she groaned as her body began to shake.</p> <p>I felt the first spasm of her orgasm, and, knowing that I was just moments away, I began to slide my cock in and out, making sure her pussy rubbed my shaft as I slid in and out. With every downward thrust forward, she clenched her muscles, squeezing me tighter then before. I could feel myself about to cum, as she slowed the pace. And just as her orgasm began to subside, she leaned back, pushing her ass back up as she continued to slide up and down, pushing her pussy further and further onto my cock. As she did this, her body began to quiver, then began to buck, her hands moving from her hips to her breasts. The look on her face as her body bounced and shook, was one of total exhilaration.</p> <p>"FUCK!" she cried out, as she let go and began to ride up and down on me, never slowing the pace or rhythm of her movements. "FUCK!" she cried again, as she leaned back, then threw her arms around me. In between gasps, she whispered "I love you!" as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
