I don't like you looking at me like that. Don't look at me like that. If you are like that I won't let you look at me in the first place, ever."</p> <p>She leaned back to look at me carefully. "If I was like that you would be watching me, you wouldn't be watching me. And if I was like that you wouldn't be staring at me. It's that simple. You're not the jealous type. And I'm not the jealous type. That means you're not the kind of man that would want to be with anyone other than that one. If you and I weren't together, I'd never want to be with anyone else. Even if I had sex with anybody else."</p> <p>I started to respond, but thought better of it. I let her take her time. And she just smiled and looked at me steadily. Her eyes locked with mine.</p> <p>"I don't want to be with anyone other than you," said I. And then I kissed her.</p> <p>"I won't let you have sex with anyone but you, too. I just want to have my way with you, you know," I said as my hand started to roam all over her body, and as we kissed I ran my hands over her.</p> <p>"This is not going to be what we did, John. This is what I want in return."</p> <p>After a moment she spoke again. "You said you only had one thing or even two? I know of every thing, but what does that get you?"</p> <p>"Oh it's more interesting, the more interesting."</p> <p>We kissed again, this time more passionately. I was now exploring the parts of her body that I thought about for a few moments, when I suddenly looked up and took her face in my hands. I kissed her again, this time much more forcefully. Her lips parted and we met again. In the excitement of kissing another woman I didn't think I was the type to really go all out and kiss again.</p> <p>I slipped my hand up her skirt. I could feel my hand against that soft smooth skin. I could taste it. I ran my hand along her, feeling the softness of her skin, and with just a bit of luck felt the heat of her sex as it pressed into me. That gave me the idea that she was a bit excited. Not aroused, but excited, and that aroused. And as in my imagination it gave me the idea that she was excited herself. And not just me.</p> <p>I let my hand slip around the round of her waist and then felt the wetness. That wetness was beginning to run down her thighs. As she kept kissing me she slid a finger down that wetness, into her pussy. Oh how sweet she tasted.</p> <p>"Oh, there, that's it, yes," she said, as she continued to rub up and down on my hand. "Let me feel how you feel, how you taste."</p> <p>So I did, feeling her wetness, feeling her warmth, feeling the warmth of her skin. The feeling of how she responded to me, the excitement of my hands in her body. As we kissed and felt each other it was as if she was in charge. I was on top of her, and she was going for my chest. And from that I had visions of taking off the shirt I was wearing. Or pulling down the bottom of her skirt, and then we would be inside each other's bodies. In that way we could feel each other inside as we explored each others body. With that, I felt the warmth of her soft body as her hands on me as she held me, as we kissed and caressed each others bodies.</p> <p>And then I was all in. I could feel her body responding as she moaned as we kissed and touched and made love to each other. Then my hand moved along her body, to her breasts, to her pussy.</p> <p>In my fantasy I saw her breasts in each person's hand, I imagined what they felt like, and that it was her body against mine. I could see her beautiful face with those big blue eyes, the way her mouth was open as she kissed me, could see the curves of her breasts, and feel those nipples as they made contact with my body.</p> <p>And then it was all over. We were moving with each other, I felt her body, and her mind. We moved as the last of the energy and energy left us from being in love. We were going to be each other's partner, forever and always, as it was going to be.</p> <p>I kissed her again, this time I slid my tongue in her mouth, as my hand was in her pussy.
