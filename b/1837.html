I couldn't help myself. I moved over to her to kiss her, and she leaned in for one as well. Her mouth was hot and her soft lips felt like they were on fire.</p> <p>Her body was incredible. She looked so beautiful, so womanly, so naked under our clothes. It was amazing. My body was on the verge of orgasm, and I reached for, and held, her breasts as I rolled her nipples between my fingers. She responded by leaning toward me to kiss me too. Our lips pressed together and our breasts rubbed together, our nipples touching, our hardening cocks rubbing together.</p> <p>With a sudden movement, she sat back, leaned over the arm of the couch, and spread her legs wide. "Like this" she demanded. As she lay on her backs, the tip of the dildo entered her pussy without a hint of lubricant visible, so I slowly pushed the dildo into her. As I pulled it out, it pulled tight, and I could see it stretching her open. She grabbed the arm with her other hand to hold it in place as it made its way inside her. After a few seconds of slow sliding in and out, I saw that the head was pushing up against the hole I had just left. I didn't know that I could do this this way, but it seemed to be working, because she began to breath faster and her body moved on itself.</p> <p>"You're so good baby" she moaned. I smiled to myself at that, and slowly thrust it farther into her while pushing it back out, only adding another inch. Finally, I pulled it completely out, and pushed her legs up, and thrust it in. She grunted "yes" and tried to match my thrusts, but she couldn't do it. "No - take it", she demanded.</p> <p>I wanted to, but I wanted to be able to do it. Not only would she feel the pain, but I felt that I was doing this so I could make her feel pleasure. I began to pump the dildo, as hard as I could, and felt as it slid in and out of her. The skin on the shaft was slick with my sperm, and it made it slick as well. I wanted to keep on fucking her, but I wanted her on her side. I moved one arm to turn her so that we were both facing each other. I slid a finger into her pussy, and I could feel it vibrating under her. I looked at her to see her eyes closed, and a slight smile on their lips. I took that as another sign that she wanted to have a little more, so I kissed her again and we fucked again. When the tip was fully in, I had lost all resistance. In and out, I fucked her, and in one long, rhythmic movement, I pushed the dildo in and out as fast as I could, to give her all the feel she deserved. As my body worked itself around hers, I was trying to hold onto the pleasure completely. Soon we were fucking as hard as we could, trying to get maximum pressure across our bodies. The rhythm of my thrusts was fast and strong, and she held me tightly as we reached a pinnacle again. We both came as one long, strong orgasm, as hard and as one orgasm as one long orgasm, as one long climax, as one long climax. We lay there together in post-orgasmic bliss. We hadn't even decided to continue with the slow grinding and caressing our bodies were trying to send, yet.</p> <p>We had a wonderful rest, even having our bodies exhausted from the workout. We kissed and cuddled each other and we kissed some more. Soon, we stopped kissing, and went and got dressed, saying good night and thanking each other for a wonderful weekend. On our way back to her condo, I whispered "I am so sorry, that was a wonderful ending to what we had." she whispered back "I will go and use my computer to check on things."</p> <p>We continued on our way, and soon we were back in her apartment. We talked to each other and told some of the wonderful things we had done for each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
