"Well, maybe you would," she said with a wink. And her eyes looked a little wet, Alex looked that way from time to time. But she didn't say anything else. It wasn't as though we'd been making out. It was more just a casual sexual contact between people on the side. Not what we were thinking or really wanting at all.</p> <p>And I guess what I meant by 'maybe we would.' Alex just rolled her eyes and grabbed my erection. She stroked it a couple of times and gave it a squeeze before turning around and giving it a little kiss. Alex returned to the room leaving my penis to stand at semi-mast.</p> <p>"Well, I think we're done," she said as she turned round to get out of the door. She smiled at me. "Well, I won't keep you long," she said with a wink and turned her shoulders to leave.</p> <p>"I'll be back in a little bit," I said as I put my hand on her hip.</p> <p>"You have to go for that walk," Alex said. She was looking out her door but she seemed to be looking straight into the pool at the other end of the property. I tried to get back onto my feet but it wasn't getting very much of me.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked.</p> <p>Alex gave me a look and shrugged.</p> <p>"Do you have a swim suit? I can't wear that around your house," she said.</p> <p>"I've got it in my room," I replied. "There's only a little one in my bag."</p> <p>I was trying my best to calm my nerves and just give Alex everything I had. We had known each other for years. And she was my one-time girlfriend. So although I wouldn't have wanted to, I was also attracted to Alex and the way she looked.</p> <p>I made my way back to Alex's room and she was just out of the pool on her way to her room to get changed. She was still putting on one of her skimpy little bikinis she'd bought to model for me. But now she was standing in the mirror with nothing on but a black, strapless top underneath which she really wasn't wearing. And for the first time all weekend she was naked. She was wearing a very skimpy blue sarong which didn't completely cover her body from her belly button, over which she was showing off her breasts. That bikini bottom, just barely covering her crotch.</p> <p>I was standing there in my bathing suit holding my erect penis under what I thought was my left wrist.</p> <p>"Um, that looks nice," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah thanks. I'm used to it a bit," I replied.</p> <p>"So what do you think?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just like it the other day. It feels really good," I replied. Alex seemed to be trying to see through the top as she smiled.</p> <p>"But you'll have to adjust for me," she said a little nervously.</p> <p>"Sorry. Don't mind if I do," I replied but I wasn't going to try something that she couldn't see.</p> <p>"So I guess you two are going to have to do the talking," she said, her voice now a seductive, sexy whisper.</p> <p>"Yeah, sorry," I said. I'm really trying not to be rude," I told her with a shrug.</p> <p>Alex smiled and said "Maybe we can have a glass of wine before we go," she said.</p> <p>"Sounds good," I agreed. We took the wine into the kitchen and I made a couple of glasses and then we sat on the couch watching the television. I watched Alex sit across from me. She was a pretty good looking girl. And she had a great pair of tits. I think the bikini bottom was to accentuate that in a way. But my erection was getting bigger every pass she took.</p> <p>"So, what do you like to do?" Alex asked.</p> <p>"Everything. I like to watch a bit. It's such a sensual moment to watch," I responded.</p> <p>"You like to watch me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah. But I think you're very attractive."</p> <p>But just being the compliment might have been the wrong thing to be. There was no way Alex was thinking of me as 'available' in that way. It was just me. And she wasn't really thinking of me as potential lover material...that was one of the things I was thinking about.
