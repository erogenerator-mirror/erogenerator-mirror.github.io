"Yes Ma'am!" She gave him a smile and he returned her smile.</p> <p>Doris looked in turn at him and smiled. "Yes ma'am!" she said while shaking her head.</p> <p>"What does my name mean?" he asked politely.</p> <p>"Your name is...is...'Karen,' is it Miss Karen?"</p> <p>"Yes but, please call me Karen."</p> <p>"Well you may call me that."</p> <p>Dinner went to a lovely evening and Doris was in a splendid mood. They had a very nice time. They had a wonderful dinner and enjoyed each other's company. It wasn't a sexual thing but they enjoyed each other's company.</p> <p>The last thing they said to each other before their second glass of wine was, "Well Doris?"</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"Would you like a glass of wine in my car?"</p> <p>"Of course I would, please take me to your home."</p> <p>"Would I be out of line asking you to drive alone in your car in your neighborhood?" Doris was laughing so hard she couldn't contain herself.</p> <p>Doris smiled at her and held his hand up. "It's ok. I don't mind. It's a beautiful neighborhood; I'll just walk back to my house and finish my wine." "Thank you Karen." Doris smiled and he put his arm up around her. "You look wonderful with the evening's light out."</p> <p>Karen smiled at him and said, "Thank you."</p> <p>They walked hand in hand across a beautiful lawn and ended up at Doris' house. Karen stood behind Doris while she reached for Doris' hand. Doris was thrilled that she was doing this. His arms went around her, hers around Karen's. Karen and Doris were feeling good. Doris' hands rested on Karen's thigh and she was touching her. Doris and Karen embraced and kissed tenderly.</p> <p>"Why don't we take a walk in the back yard."</p> <p>"Oh yes please do," Karen giggled. They did.</p> <p>Doris looked at Karen's exposed breasts just barely covered by her tight knit top and Karen saw her breasts jiggle slightly. "This is a lovely neighborhood. I'm almost in love," Doris said. Karen looked at Doris; she was smiling.</p> <p>Doris was in a new world for her. She liked being with Karen. She loved her. She thought many a evening with Doris would lead to a very memorable night. What a lucky woman to have such a wonderful relationship. Karen's mind raced. It would just be another dinner, what were they all going to do? Would they do more sex? Maybe they would just kiss and fondle each other. It could be just that. Doris could feel Karen's heart beating against her arm. It was a strong beat. It must be very strong for Karen. She would have to walk home alone. Doris' mind made up her mind. She just had to make this night special for Karen. Karen must love her. Karen always did. She just had to be with someone.</p> <p>Doris had just started the walk home. She could feel Karen's arms around her as she walked. Their legs were touching each other, and their breasts were lightly touching. Karen's nipples were showing her excitement. They smiled and giggled. They hugged for a few minutes and were laughing and giggling with each other.</p> <p>"I love you," Doris blurted out and they kissed. It was a very lovely kiss.</p> <p>Doris' hand went into Karen's lap and she touched her thigh. Her hands were on Karen's inner thigh. Her fingers touched her warm soft thigh. Karen's eyes closed and Doris' fingers did things. Karen had found out that an electric shock had been a part of Karen's evening. Doris touched Karen's pussy and it got Karen's juices flowing. Their kiss was hot and wet and it made Karen feel good. Doris smiled at Karen and she kissed her again. Her kiss was so hot and so erotic.</p> <p>Doris' hand moved over Karen's body. She knew that her hand was right there. There was a difference in their minds, Doris looked at Karen and saw her look, but not notice. Doris began to rub Karen's pussy through her skirt. She could feel Karen's excitement. She felt Karen's pussy getting wet. Her fingers went higher up her thigh and soon Doris was touching the top of Karen's panties. Her hand was up against the top of the panty's waistband. Her fingers slipped down the waistband of Karen's panties and she was moving the panties up and over her body and to the floor.
