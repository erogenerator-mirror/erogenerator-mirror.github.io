The way we both taste, my friend. You will always have a little bit of me in your mouth, will always be grateful to my friend, and I will always love you for what you do."</p> <p>I could feel an urgency, and with that the thought of tasting that was my undoing. This was the final straw as I opened my blouse and undid my bra as if it was one of my own devices. It was all the way open now and with my breasts exposed my own tits were in the open. I was breathing hard and my nipples were straining against the cotton fabric.</p> <p>There was no way that I was going to be able to take this. I was going to have to be passive. No, no no, the girl had other plans! She would finish what she had said to me by kissing her way down my legs and licking them. Oh, her tongue, that was better. I could think of nothing more than that.</p> <p>With my nipples, her tongue, I heard her voice. "The first time you kissed one of those, you are going to do things to me that you never even imagined in your life. A girl will do her share for that!" My own moans, which meant they were the start of much in my imagination, told her that all was true.</p> <p>Slightly to my own surprise, she paused, and, with a very gentle touch, began to run her tongue all over my breasts. First first to my right nipple, then to my left. I think that I was a bit more aware than I'd remember. However, as she did so her tongue, with its tip running all the way, down my stomach, stopped just short of my panties. Her fingers did the same on my other breast. Then suddenly, without any warning, she was pushing me onto my back and kneeling between my legs. Before I could object, her mouth was already there and her hands were there also. Oh how I wanted those hands on me and those fingers on me.</p> <p>I felt her tongue run into me, and then her mouth and her mouth were on me, tongue and lips on me. She had a strong tongue and with that, she pushed her tongue up into me and began to lick me again. All of this was going to happen almost as one, and although it could have just started, I know there were some things I wanted to do that would start with a kiss, but the experience of feeling her tongue in me.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" I moaned. "That feels so good."</p> <p>The second time it started, the whole feeling of tongue in me, the feeling of softness there, the feeling of her, in touch.</p> <p>We were both going up and down on the chair as I lay back to enjoy the feeling. The first kiss was like nothing before, but even more like a lover. She was licking me there so that I could experience the sensations that my body had never had. Her hands were also on me, pulling off my top, and pushing my bra and panties off in one slow motion. She didn't move fast enough, instead continuing to kiss me, moving all over me, and with my own hands, too.</p> <p>She had a finger, just a little, up me. That was all. She was doing the licking at the top of me with her tongue and the kissing with her fingers and with her mouth. Then, with a little more strength than I was accustomed to, she had slipped a second finger in me and began moving them around inside me. "Is that it", I said, "please do me some more like that."</p> <p>"Yes, yes", she responded, "I have so much more to give you." She moved one finger to a third and began moving them in and out for me. The way she said it, she had an idea, which made me so excited I could no longer resist. The thought of her finger in itself, it would feel lovely and feel so warm on my clit, was making me even more excited and my body reacted to it.</p> <p>She was doing this so wonderfully, not really doing it enough, just rubbing, stroking me with her fingers. She had three fingers in me, one on each of my outer lips, and she was pulling out to put pressure on my clit with her thumb as it moved, pulling on it. Then she would push back to move the fingers so that they had access to my inner, inner lips. I was close to coming and just had to do something to trigger it. It was the first of many orgasms that were about to occur.</p> <p>Then, finally, it was my turn to come.</p> <p>"Come now", she said. "Come on, come for me", she said, as she pulled the fingersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
