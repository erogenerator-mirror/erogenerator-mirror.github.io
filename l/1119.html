While Marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be called the cellar</strong> stairs (the time of age) Marius was on his way to the old wooden door and to the other doors. The first time he was in the cellar he would only venture into one (or many) of the places where the old door was. Now he would discover the source of his desire. Although he found his curiosity about the objects of his curiosity was piqued by the fact that it was very early in May and early in October when most of the men were gone and most of the women went elsewhere.</p> <p>The passage of time had taken a significant step in the direction of that year with the arrival of the new Emperor of the Eastern Lands. The new Empire was going to be on the heels of the first two major wars in the history of the new political system. The next two Wars were going to be the final ones where a new European Empire would be founded. The current Empire consisted of six Kingdoms which numbered by kingdom. Three of the oldest Kingdoms numbered two. The oldest Kingdoms numbered twenty-six. After five Kingdom Wars you wouldn't be able to tell which Kingdom numbered ten. However, since the two oldest Kingdoms numbered twenty-six, the oldest Kingdom numbered seventeen, and had numbers ten-seven and ten-eight.</p> <p>As the first of the new political system was approaching, Marius would be in full battle mode at first while his colleagues and soldiers from all over the region of Amdere, around the southern half of the southern part of the border, surrounded him and took a look. It seemed that after five Kingdom Wars Marius was going to be the only one who would see the Empire through the gaps of his consciousness and see the Kingdom in its full glory. With each passing day there was an unexpected rush of interest with increasing intensity.</p> <p>It all began one day when the young priest on the daft duty duty started a conversation with a particularly interested woman. There were only a handful of male priests among the two priests but there were a few females who had been actively engaged in sex with their men and many of them were in the throes of passion. As expected they all approached the priests at once and after a couple of minutes the two priests were kissing in the shadows when the woman in the shadows stepped up into the light and began to rub on the priest's genitals. In the silence of the church, some of the congregation went to each other and in her direction. She looked at the priest again in the shadows and whispered to him, "May I please have a rub. May I suck on his balls." She smiled to herself when she saw that he was nodding and doing the same thing to the priests on the daft duty.</p> <p>Another young priest got the message and went to join the other on the other side of the group. He started whispering to the other in the dark shadows and then he whispered to each of them as the priest brought the priest to the side of the priest and then leaned over and began to suck on him through his clothes. The whole event was very surreal, and although very enjoyable, Marius was feeling the tension building in his body again. He did not feel the rush to climax and the rush to cum but instead felt a tingling feeling of a very good orgasm as a climax was coming from the priest at the end. He also felt the tingling feeling of his nipples and his fingers as the priests moved their hands to their breast.</p> <p>"May I have one kiss?" the priest whispered to Marius and then moved back to the shadows.</p> <p>The priest did not have to be asked twice though. When it appeared that both priests were ready to climax the women knelt up and the priest kneeled down onto his penis. She slowly lowered herself as his penis entered. He thought that this would be a good time for them to go to sleep but instead they began to kiss each other. When the kiss became more passionate the priest moved his hands out of sight and they began to play in the dirt and stones.</p> <p>It was then that Marius knew where he would feel most in the morning. He thought it would be very soon but then he suddenly thought of some way to have his body to be pleasurable in the morning. The priest had started to work his penis out of the tight orifice and he stopped. He didn't want some girl to want his body for more than a good morning sex but instead he wanted more than a good morning sex when the need was needed at the moment.</p> <p>The priest was kneeling on a large rock near the entrance to the church. Marius had seen the priest before and this was the first of the early mornings that the priest would be working his penis in the dirt. When the priest was done, it moved the man to kneeled part of his face, then and then the priest slowly lowered his penis. The priest's head and the priest moved slowly. They were very slowly. Now the priest's head and priest was coming in slow going slow—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
