The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air.</strong> The storm was still raging through the area, and they moved across the street to the Rue Mouffetard. She opened the heavy door of the room; we had all got a drink of champagne in the main bar, and the crowd had thinned. We entered, we closed the heavy door, and followed her into the room (our room? What the fuck is a room?) It was lit by candles, but the room was dimly lit with an electric electric light, like a movie screen with a lamp lit. It was cozy. I sat in front of her in the chair, and she sat down on my lap, with a single strand of long fingers. She moved her head from side to side and rested it, her eyes closed. We kissed, and slowly. There was no tongue. We were kissing with just two, but they were so gentle! They were all right! It was erotic, and it was thrilling – too right! She was a beautiful, sexy young woman; so much sexier than the other girl I had ever known. I wanted this to last...I was too. We talked in whispers.</p> <p>“I’m going to come, too!” She whispered “do you want to come with me?”</p> <p>I was too, and I replied, “It has been too long.”</p> <p>“But don’t you want to hold it?” She looked very serious, and gave that special smile of hers.</p> <p>“No! I’m not going to come.”</p> <p>“I know you want to hold it.” She said, and leaned forward. I felt her warm mouth enclose my penis as she opened her lips wide to get it deep inside her mouth. I loved the feeling. It was a real thrill!!!</p> <p>She moved her face back and forth and began to suck my cock really nicely, and really fast, while her fingers played in the shaft. She took it out of her mouth and played with it with her tongue, and it seemed to make her face so shiny. She let go, but kept the head in her mouth and then slowly lowered her mouth down onto my cock again. Back and forth she went, and I was really enjoying the sight of that wonderful, lovely mouth on my cock! She looked up at me and said, “I love your eyes!”</p> <p>“I love it!” I responded with my own response.</p> <p>I reached up and slid my hands down to her boobs, her hard nipples showing very clearly through the thin material of her blouse. She kept her eyes on mine, with her hair dangling from one shoulder. We kept kissing, fondling each other’s boobs, and she let go and slid my hands back to her breasts, which had become big and swollen from my stroking them. She smiled and said, “No more!”</p> <p>I didn’t know how to respond, but I kept my mouth on hers while she sucked it. We were both breathing hard and I could feel her heart beat rising to a fast speed.</p> <p>I broke off, and reached around her to unhook her blouse. She was wearing something under it, but she didn’t stop me, and she raised up her torso and let it fall around her head, still with her bra. Then she took my hand and led me, like we were falling, to the bed where I saw a wide mirror, all lit up by candles. There I saw my face in that mirror, and I was staring at something else in that mirror.</p> <p>“Do you like what you see?” she asked, but this time from out of the mirror, I smiled and nodded. She smiled again and said, “Yes!”</p> <p>She moved to the bed, and I knelt next to the bed. I put both hands on her beautiful, smooth, smooth boobs, then she held one of them, and with her other hand, she rubbed my hand over her nipples. It was an electric thrill! Then I put my hands on her butt, and she did the same to me, and we kissed for a long time. She was a beautiful lady; so hot, so sexual. She moaned, I was moaning, as our kissing got stronger. Her boobs were magnificent in my hands, and I was very excited by the sight of her soft boobs as my hands were busy in them. We both moaned and my penis was growing up a notch.</p> <p>“Don’t stop!” she gasped, and my hands were all over her ass.</p> <p>I reached my arms around her butt and pulled, and she reached into my face and we kissed again moved her boobs, so passionately.</p> <p>I was kissing her tits were kissing so, we were kissing, and she kissed—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
