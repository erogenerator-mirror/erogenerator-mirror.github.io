Fixing the Nets</h4><p><strong>“We’re at close grips at last,” said Holmes as we walked together across the moor. “What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself together in the face of</strong> such a profound discovery!” We made our way further down the corridor, down the flight of stairs and over to the study room door, he holding a chair in front of it.</p> <p>“Where’s Harry?” said Holmes as he opened the door to the study room. “Why, wait, come along, I haven’t got all day. You guys can have the study room tomorrow.”</p> <p>“We’ve only just got here,” said Holmes. “Just wait till tomorrow then you guys join me!”</p> <p>We nodded and followed Mr Watson into the study room. “Come on, everyone’s waiting,” said Holmes, sitting down and pulling me up with him. Holmes kissed me quickly, and then proceeded to strip, leaving me standing there with just my panties on. I stood there with my breasts hanging loose, nipples hard, while he slid his boxers off. He pushed me down to my knees and stepped out of them, his dick looking absolutely huge sticking straight in my face. “Nice!” he said excitedly as I opened my mouth and licked the soft head with the tip of my tongue. I wrapped my full lips around the shaft and swirled my tongue around the head. I felt Mr Watson tense as I laved his balls slowly with my tongue, before licking my way back up the shaft and sucking on the head as I ran my hands up and down his shaft.</p> <p>“Good.” He said as I brought him back to the brink of orgasm, before sucking his balls into my mouth and running the thumb and forefinger of my hand over the base of his cock, feeling the pre-cum oozing out before pushing my lips down on his shaft.</p> <p>I stood up and pulled his mouth off my nipple. “You want another feel?” I said as I pushed him back into the easy chair once again. “Come and lie down on your back,” I said as I dragged my panties down my legs to my ankles, pulling them off as I walked to the bed. I laid down on my back and put my arms over the side. “Sit up,” I said. “I want to feel your lips around my breasts. I want to have my first real sex with someone else!”</p> <p>“What’s this?” said Holmes, as he stood over me, his erection standing straight out in front of him, pointing up at my face. “This is just what I think it will be!” he said, as he lowered his cock to my lips. “Now, get comfortable.” He said as he put a pillow on the carpet and sat down on it, putting his body between my thighs.</p> <p>I spread my legs even wider, and started to stroke my slit as I put and caressed his cock. “Just like in your dream,” I said as I ran my hands all over his hairy chest, feeling his muscles tense as I rubbed him against my wet pussy lips. “You’ve got great breasts,” I said as I ran my fingers around his nipples, playing with them gently as he lay back and closed his eyes.</p> <p>“No, no!” he said trying to reach out to me. “No! I’ve got to have you now,” he said as I continued to massage his cock with firm strokes. “Take me like you know you want!”</p> <p>I moved onto my back as he lowered himself on top of me. “I want you like this!” I said, smiling. “Now fuck me! Ride me! Drive your hot cock into me! I want to feel it as much as I do! But not before we both go to sleep!”</p> <p>We had already gone to bed, which was the first time I had used our bedroom for sex. I was horny after feeling Holmes’ cock move up and down my thighs, but I still felt like we had to start now. And I didn’t want to forget where we were staying tomorrow, and how we had all been so busy that it would be impossible to make love for long, long hours.</p> <p>I pulled Holmes up to kiss him as he slipped under the duvet towards me. “No-one’s ever been able to make love to me like this,” I whispered as I felt his lips kissing me there, his hands reaching up to cup my breasts. “But it’s been so long I thought! And that he must do’t ever get any time to do love you to love me!” I thought as I said as I pulled myself and kissed me and went lower myself to have his cock slipped my knees—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
