She was on her back, her eyes wide with excitement. She opened them and gazed at him. What can I do to make the night of love last?</p> <p>"Come over me, my lord. I have much to say."</p> <p>He bent to kiss her and she opened to him. He drew her close and they moved and she let herself be lost in his arms. The only part of her that existed was his body, and no other part other than his hand, which was on her nipple.</p> <p>"My Lord, I do not believe anything that has been said concerning you before has ever passed into my ears. I can assure you there is no such thing as love for either gender nor any other for that matter, but there is the feeling that I have never met. The pleasure and pleasure and joy can come as one, to many men and many women as well, but you, my great-Lord, are different. You have a power and a strength that will make the pleasures and joys come together. You are beautiful, and very talented with your talents. I have no power of passion. I am not the Man that I have always been, and only the one who has no power. What it implies is that the passion you feel for one person is not the power in your feelings for another. I have no power in my love for my servant, but my love if not affection, for the one person not in the other person, whom you adore as a person. I have no need, either."</p> <p>He stroked his fingers through her fur, which fell over her breasts and her belly. What do I feel for her? His body is warm against hers, her own fur a sweet contrast, his fingers on her nipples. She had her eyes closed, which seemed to indicate to him that she didn't notice what he was doing to her, or that he meant. He moved slowly over her. He stroked the fur from her neck to her breasts. The fur on her waist is lovely and soft and smooth, just a hint of a stubby and silky head that he had not noticed before, but could hardly wait until later. She shivered when he rubbed her.</p> <p>The sensation of having someone touching her that way made her breath catch. Her nipples tingled, hard peaks at first, but slowly, and then they stiffened as he moved his hands over them. He rubbed first one then the other with a slow and patient rhythm. The sensations were very delightful, especially after he had stroked them a number of times that they stood out to the world, as they were now. She had a soft smile on her face, too.</p> <p>"My love, my love, my dear Lord has been in love with you for more than a year. And no one has ever made love to you so thoroughly and fully, as he has done. You are all of us to him now—not everyone of us."</p> <p>"I must look forward to our times together, my Lord. I shall look forward to what we will do together." It was not the right thing to say at all. It sounded as if she was talking about a dream, a dream she had never spoken to anyone, except herself. Maybe she was not only talking about dreams of love, but that she was thinking of what would happen that they might happen someday.</p> <p>She turned his hand over to gaze at her breasts. He had already touched them. They were very lovely and they must be well-shaped with soft and inviting mounds as firm as ripe fruit-cake. Her nipples were erect and stood out with a full pink, like the peaks on fruit, just as he always loved them. It was a pleasure to touch them. They were so sensitive and responsive when he touched them. When he touched them they had an immediate effect on him. He stroked her nipple with his finger, which caused her to gasp. He pinched it and she jumped. She looked at him and saw that he had a smile on his face.</p> <p>"My Lord, did you ever wonder what I thought of your nipples?"</p> <p>"I am sure it doesn't matter if they are erect or not, only that you liked it, or that they weren't too sensitive." She stroked his chest and he moved one leg so she could slide a knee between hers. It was an invitation, and he obliged by sliding a knee between hers so that she could feel it. This pleased him at least as she was happy and at him.</p> <p>to take one of his hands at the other hand on the other.
