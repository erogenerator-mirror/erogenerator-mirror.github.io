Drawn to the Loadstone Rock</h4><p><strong>In such risings of fire and risings of sea—the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the flow,</strong> only now it was to be washed by the sea.</p> <p>Sheath. "Cum," she breathed, pressing her hand inward. "Cum."</p> <p>"Yes," he said, then added. "Yes."</p> <p>With a start, he had gone over the edge. His climax, the moment of truth, was nearing. Sheath reached out. "I'm c—gonna cum. C—God—please." Sheath released a jet of semen toward him. He gasped in shock, his eyes shutting. He turned on his back, his penis deflating. "God—fuck. Fuck." Sheath fell on her back. Her face and breasts were on fire. Sheath's face was a picture of his pleasure, the sight of his erection, the sound of his passion; he was the center of her universe. He didn't deserve her, she thought.</p> <p>After a few moments, he stirred, turning off the lamp. He was naked in a moment, his penis still erect in his hand.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he murmured, looking at His nude body. It was beautiful. "I'm sorry." Still lying on her back, he lay beside her, his penis still erect, its head touching her shoulder and the curve of her arm.</p> <p>He kissed her, their tongues exploring. And her mouth—the soft lips that had once held his.</p> <p>Her hand stroked him. "It's all right," he said. "I was only thinking of you."</p> <p>"I know. I'm just a little bit disappointed." Sheath's hand slid down her body, stroking her breasts. "Do you want me?" Sheath's hand slid to her vagina. Then, his penis went in. For a moment, he paused for a moment. "I'd love to take you from behind," she whispered, then added. "I'd like to be in your ass."</p> <p>He nodded in an unconvincing manner. "And you?"</p> <p>Her hand was around him, a finger tracing a route from his tip, to the tip of his penis then downward to his base. "If this is what I should do, do it."</p> <p>He stroked her ass, then, and then he moved. "Do what?" He asked.</p> <p>Her hand rose and came down again. "Let me see," she said. Sheath kissed her ass cheek while his middle finger ran its path up and down. "Yes." Sheath kissed her ass, and he licked at all of them. Then he kissed her cheeks, cheeks and her neck. Then she was kissing him.</p> <p>Her thumb rubbed at his penis while his finger stroked her asshole. "Let me make you cum!" Sheath's face was burning. The intensity of his kiss was the height of eroticism: His mouth open and his tongue active, dancing among the lips of her butt. Sheath's hand was around his testicles, moving in an almost trancelike rhythm. "Do it," Sheath whispered, not willing to let go. But his finger moved faster and harder. "Do it," he repeated.</p> <p>His finger pushed into her anus. "But--"</p> <p>His lips and tongue were everywhere. "But," Sheath breathed, "but" He moved his penis a bit, then he came inside her ass.</p> <p>Her body was aflame. "I'm sorry," she whispered. "I'm so sorry."</p> <p>Sheath's penis stayed soft as his semen, though he still ejaculated, he was spent now. He rolled off and put his penis, which was limp, back towards her, the tip wet with his semen, pressing against her anus. "Would you like to go back to the hotel and sleep with me again?" Sheath wanted to ask about their love. "Would you? Would you really, really, really want to take me back to the hotel?"</p> <p>Sheath didn't want to ask about their love. "I'd like this, too," she whispered.</p> <p>They lay there, both naked, as if waiting for the next day. Sheath's erection returned with a vengeance, the hardness of his organ causing an itch in the back of her body. It felt so good. And she was so warm. "You're so warm," he whispered.</p> <p>"You can feel more of me," she murmured. "Let me do you do you." Sheath kissed her breasts.</p> <p>"Let me," she said.</p> <p>Partly as a favor, partly an order. Sheath and he had made love many times, and now he was going to do the next.</p> <p>Sheath.
