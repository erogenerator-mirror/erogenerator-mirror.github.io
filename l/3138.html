This is not a textbook class-book-Practical-Learning-For-School-Students-and-Learning-For-Lays!</p> <p>The purpose of these lessons was to be taught to every human being by an instructor and to help improve the lives of the students by teaching their practical-Learning-For-School-School-Class-Class-Name-Class-Like-No-ways-Any-time-I-Have-OrA-Fantastic-Stop-Pun-E-Nights.</p> <p>There are many times in the human being, the human being whose only sexual organ is his dick, that the very idea of sexual intercourse can bring sexual pleasure and pain. And it can bring pleasure, pain, and suffering. In spite of that, all that is the nature of sexual education.</p> <p>The whole purpose of the Sex Education Programme is to help students learn sexual pleasure and learning new sexual ideas and skills in order to understand their own sexual desires. If we learn to teach sexual pleasure and learn new sexual ways, we will be very successful! And all these lessons can become our lifelong-Class-Learning-For-School-Student-Class-Students-and-For-Life!</p> <p>----------</p> <p>I would prefer to introduce you to the first part of this lesson, then I will start the next lesson. In the beginning, we will begin with the basics. I will explain how sexually relevant is a useful Path in Life.</p> <p>Let me begin with a discussion about sexual experiences, first.</p> <p>I will start by taking you at your age. Your mind is young and your body is very slender. You are very lucky. Now, for about a year, from age 18-30, we will begin with the basics. First, I will look you over. Then I will begin with learning your body. Let us begin with a lesson about my eyes. And, eventually (if we do not already), I just want to look you over for a moment. This will begin with observing your physical appearance. I am looking at you now. Then, I will start with noticing you.</p> <p>My eyes... They are looking at you... Your body... Your breasts... Your ass... It feels good, I am looking at your body... It feels good to be looking at you... It feels good to be in your class... It feels good to be naked in front of you... And, it feels good to be walking in the park... At night... In the woods... At day... (Yes...) At night... At any time... At any place... (Yes...) Let me observe you... Let me see... Let me observe you... But at night... Don't even think about your clothes... Don't even think about your clothes... I'm studying your body... The pleasure comes with the thoughts.</p> <p>I would like to examine you... Let us start with your eyes. I would want to study your face for a moment and see your eyes. I want to observe you with my eyes.. Do you want to go into the nearby bushes? Have you gone inside the bushes? Are you going in the bushes? Do you have your legs open? Why won't you just stand there?</p> <p>As I will see, yes. You will like that. That's just how it has been for us. When you first started doing this for us, you were very shy. Now, you're more experienced... Are you really interested in what it feels like to explore yourself... Do you want to find out what it feels like to be touched?</p> <p>Come to the first part of this lesson. And, let us start with our bodies...</p> <p>Now, it will be easy if we undress. First, you just have lovely legs. The body of a woman...</p> <p>Let me examine you properly - my eyes...</p> <p>You can see how lovely and beautiful you are : Your whole body.... And, especially your breasts... I would like to know them... My eyes could see your whole body...</p> <p></p> <p>Let us look up... We will look under the whole body of pleasure... For a breast... for your breasts... My eyes...</p> <p></p> <p>(No words...</p> <p>... I'll begin in my eyes... your whole</p> <p>- And we will be in each Let - our breasts together: - your eyes</p> <p>- for</p> <p>- My own - the same way</p> <p>- I- mine</p> <p>- My eyes</p> <p>- my eyes - together - we - I, the eyes</p> <p><| I - the way yours: ourselves; for</p> <p></p> <p>+</p> <p>- like</p> <p>- and ... my</p> <p>< <: my sightâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
