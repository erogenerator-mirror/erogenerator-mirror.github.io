Whatsoever is now present, and from day to day hath its existence;</h4><p><strong>all objects of memories, and the minds and memories themselves, incessantly consider, all things that are, have their being by change and alteration. Use thyself therefore often to meditate upon</strong> them.</p> <p>It was time for me to do that, when the day finally arrived for us to go ahead and do that. We had decided to go ahead with our plan.</p> <p>As my father and mother waited patiently, their parents smiled and waved them on, and they waved me on. I guess since it was the middle of winter, the snow had started to fall and my mother and I didn't mind too much, even though she looked at me and smiled.</p> <p>As the day finally arrived for the first day of the new year, my father and mother hugged and began kissing on the mouth, holding each other close to each other during the momentous day. I have always thought of that moment as the happiest of my father's memories. The moment in which he gave birth was that time in which he made the beginning of my life.</p> <p>Chapter Two: The Beginning</p> <p>I awoke to the feel that the entire night was completely forgotten. I thought of everything I saw: that moment of love between two people. And even though the world is full of memories of that night, my father said, "Donna! Don't forget those moments." He meant every word: the moment of love.</p> <p>As I thought of the moment, I wondered how many memories that he had said. "That was the happiest time in my life."</p> <p>I realized that while I had been dreaming of those moments of love, I missed his words and those words spoken in my father's mouth.</p> <p>Chapter Three: Day One</p> <p>Now that I am about to experience, there is to be no point in having a discussion of the days and weeks of love and passion. We are going forward with our plan, and I don't mean in the least to try to convince you that it's all because of the time that Dad used to spend with me. But the reality is that a plan is always, not only wise to have in mind, but also wise to have to have in mind.</p> <p>On the very night that you have to sleep in our room, I am afraid that neither of us can keep our hands of our selves. And the day begins at the moment of the wedding and the day of consummation of marriage.</p> <p>We entered the room and saw an entirely beautiful, but tired, lady in her late 30's standing in the door. She did not look like the kind of person that you are usually looking for in any one of your romantic fantasies, but she looked beautiful to me.</p> <p>"Hello, dear." She said.</p> <p>As I looked at her, she looked at me with lust in her eye.</p> <p>"Oh, Hi, Mrs. Smith. I don't want it to be a formal orgy. That's the whole 'old stuff'. Besides you don't know who you are marrying in a short time. You will not be invited to our bed tonight unless you're married with your husband."</p> <p>"I couldn't agree to that, dear. It was not supposed to be a formal event."</p> <p>I guess we have had this conversation before: the moment of wedding is that special day. Since the day of the nuptials is our moment of love, then the moment of marriage is that perfect moment.</p> <p>"No, it is not a wedding ceremony." I said.</p> <p>"I guess you don't want to see my face anymore, now about that."</p> <p>She moved towards me and sat down in the chair.</p> <p>"Now don't be such a prude. It's our night. I know you remember what I am wearing."</p> <p>With that she reached out and removed the wedding clothes from under her gown. I couldn't tear my eyes away from her body. I was almost in awe of her.</p> <p>"How do you like these?" I asked.</p> <p>"They are wonderful." She said, as I moved towards her and kissed her there on the forehead.</p> <p>"Why don't I take them off?" I said, taking the gown off from her shoulders.</p> <p>"It's really not that much difference that they have been worn for years." She said as I went on to remove the gown.</p> <p>I reached out and touched her face with both my hands as I removed the gown. I kept them on her for a while, just touching her face, with my face just at her neckline. Then I moved both his hands along her body, and caressed her breasts, and then moved my head to lick at them and play with them as I felt her mouth on my chest.</p> <p>We were now in a very special moment of passion, as I felt both hands moving all over her body, feeling each of her body while we were kissing, on the lips, mouth and mouth. My hands were touching all her while we were fucking each of her. Now I was completely under her while we were in that I was fucking her completely between herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
