But he never did. He just couldn't. He was stuck with himself. He was the son of a great husband.</p> <p>His daughter hadn't been that far off the path. She was a senior in college, and recently he'd been invited to visit her new home, one of the few remaining houses in the city. It had been a long time since he'd seen her. And he couldn't ever stop imagining her in bed again.</p> <p>But that was his future.</p> <p>As much as he'd missed his daughter, a part of him wanted to be somewhere other than home with his wife, where it was safe for him to fuck her whenever he wanted. And not every man would want to be a part of that, and most men never got the chance.</p> <p>As soon as he heard the familiar sound of his wife's doorbell, he hurriedly slid his jeans and shirt up, and opened the door.</p> <p>There she was. Standing there, wearing a very short cotton summer dress and looking very sexy. Just a couple feet away, she looked like a movie star. And she was still his wife.</p> <p>"Hi," she said to him cheerfully. "What's the occasion?"</p> <p>"Well, I just thought I'd come over and say hello," he said. "Sorry for barging in on you like that..."</p> <p>"It's okay, honey," she told him. "It's my friend here. He's a friend of mine, right?"</p> <p>She put her arms around his neck and gave him a warm kiss. His cock pulsed when he felt her tongue snake out of her mouth. Her hands were on his cheeks, rubbing him gently as she brought her mouth back down to kiss him again.</p> <p>Then she pulled him over to her bed, and let her hands move down to his pants, where she immediately unbuckled his belt and unzipped his pants. The bulge in his pants was obvious to both of them.</p> <p>It was his turn now. If he wasn't standing behind him, he could have been watching the way her tits jiggled at the corner of her dress.</p> <p>She lowered her mouth to his cock and sucked it between her lips. He groaned with pleasure as his dick filled her mouth. She slurped and licked all around his head, and deepthroated his shaft until his cock became completely hard.</p> <p>When she pulled back from it, the entire length was glistening with her saliva from the tip of his large cock to the bottom of his balls. She moved down the bed, straddling his lap, and began sucking him again.</p> <p>"I can't believe I let you fuck me." She panted when she came up for air. "I've waited so long to do that," she confessed to him.</p> <p>"It's not the first time," he told her. "But you're the hottest lady I've ever seen, and I just can't wait to be able to do you."</p> <p>He grabbed her hair and pulled her off of his cock, but she didn't stop sucking him, because her hands never stopped moving up and down his body. And when she did this again, she was practically shaking as she reached down and wrapped her hands around his balls, lifting up his shirt so she could feel his cock press up against her fingers and her pussy.</p> <p>Still holding on to his balls, she moved herself closer to him, then wrapped both of her arms around his neck and kissed him again.</p> <p>And when their tongues brushed against each other, she broke the kiss and stared into his eyes with heat and lust. "Oh, God, you feel so good," she said as she kissed him again. "So good."</p> <p>The intensity of their kiss was intoxicating. As much as she had been looking forward to fucking him, she couldn't wait to get her sweet pussy to be filled with his hard, thick cock. She didn't even care if he was the only one fucking her.</p> <p>It was a good thing.</p> <p>He could have easily moved over to the other side of the bed, but he wouldn't be able to. His wife had been a lot more experienced than him, and his mouth could probably still taste his wife's pussy on his lips.</p> <p>He needed to feel inside of his wife.</p> <p>He couldn't resist pushing his fingers along her pussy. She responded by pushing herself against his fingers, and her juices dripped down his wrist.</p> <p></p> <p>"You're going to fuck me now, sweetheart?</p> <p></p> <p>So close to say it</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Oh, baby Say is too much</p> <p>.</p> <p>. You love</p> <p>I want it Oh yesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
