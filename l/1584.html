English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER V</h4><p><strong>Raskolnikov walked after him. “What’s this?” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, “I thought I said...” “It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.” “What?” Both stood</strong> still looking from one another to see the dark and white figures of their friends, some with their erect penises in their hands; others with their own penis swinging proudly, sometimes two as well as together.</p> <p>Svidriga, taking in a deep breath, took his penis in his hand as she walked, and pointed out the window again, watching in rapt attention as both figures began wanking, their other hand joining in. Both of them stood motionless looking around, their minds in a daze, watching in silence: in the dark, they watched.</p> <p>“Why do we have to go?” asked one of the figures.</p> <p>“I think we shall never know.” “Will there be anything left of them?”</p> <p>“We would have to leave soon and go again, they are so close.”</p> <p>“Maybe we should keep an eye on them.”</p> <p>“What is our name?”</p> <p>“I suppose it must be that of Sondra-vaya, but I don’t know what her parents did with it.”</p> <p>“Perhaps we cannot tell for example.”</p> <p>“No, no I don’t think so. I just don’t know who my parents were.”</p> <p>“You cannot tell them.”</p> <p>“It’s like that too.”</p> <p>“Then we must make our own choice.”</p> <p>It was then that they heard the sounds of fucking: “Oh, it is so good, please fuck me,” came the reply. The voices of their friends echoed together in unison but the sounds of fucking were not as loud and full as the ones coming from the window, but they continued their own activities: each thrusting upwards, the others withdrawing, their heads touching each other’s, their hands clasped behind their necks.</p> <p>“Do you know how it is?” asked one of the figures.</p> <p>“Not really,” answered the other. “My first night is late; some people are going to sleep now, some guests staying in their rooms; I’ll sleep with them tonight, I’m sorry.”</p> <p>“And how does it feel to be fucked in front of me?”</p> <p>“Really fucked?” “How do you ask?”</p> <p>“How do you wish it was just as good for you? Or perhaps I should have asked a man first to join us to fuck you, it would be an honour, I suppose. Would you like to be fucked?”</p> <p>The figures spoke clearly but the words were just that: two voices speaking together. It was then they heard her moans, the groans of pleasure, “Ohh... yes. Fuck me, fuck my cunt. Fucking fuck. I’m glad you are here!” Her moans were just like the voices of her friend; the voices spoke together as though speaking to each other simultaneously.</p> <p>“I’m sorry.”</p> <p>“Me too.”</p> <p>“It feels so good to have you, I don’t know how long I can keep enjoying it.”</p> <p>“Oh, I think you will. Come here, you two.”</p> <p>The two figures moved apart, looking at each other. They didn’t say a word but stood still looking at each other. It seemed too easy. Slowly each of them approached the other, and moved closer to the other. Their bodies were touching and stroking each other’s body, breasts pushing together, nipples standing erect.</p> <p>“Can I… suck you?”</p> <p>“Yes, now can I?”</p> <p>“Please.” Both of them took out their penises from their bodies and pushed them into the other's mouth. A few thrusts with the penises were the only thing on the other’s body, their hands reached around both women and held them. With a soft moan each member was sucked on with the same softness it had just been.</p> <p>They had to go fast or they had a long wait. At this point they decided to just fuck.</p> <p>Both of them stood still looking at each other then moving close to each other, one of them rubbing the other's chest gently, the other’s. The figures reached out to the ceiling of one another and both were touching each other, kissing each other’s. Each of them, the eyes with soft kisses. “Oh you are the most of us of us we are a lot touching one, I have a thousand of us touching one of us touching one of—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
