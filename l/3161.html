M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXI. A New Departure in Flavorings</h4><p><strong>DEAR ME, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as Mrs. Lynde says,” remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books down on the kitchen table on</strong> the other side of the pool. Anne couldn't help but notice that the room was empty, so she and Susan exchanged a knowing glance, and they were still only in the swimsuit bottoms, just as Susan said. Anne quickly made quick work of the top and bottom, and then stripped her own, letting the top fall onto the pool deck. She was left with her bikini bottom on, which Susan had already removed when she came in. They both smiled at their naked bodies, but that didn't mean that they didn't ogle. As it was, Anne had a hard time keeping the bulge in her swimsuit contained. Susan was pretty in her own way; she looked like an athlete, but Anne found that the bikini bottom was getting in the way more and more as she neared her point of climax. “Wow, this is going to be a fun trip,” Anne thought to herself, as her orgasm began. She let her eyes slip closed and enjoyed her climax while her nipples were teased by her hands as she was cumming. Susan was watching Anne’s reaction with a knowing smile, and she was just about to join in when Anne said, “My god, I need to use the computer so bad, Anne. Why haven’t you been reading it?” She smiled and put her book down. Anne, who seemed a little embarrassed by the fact that her neighbor was watching her as she masturbated, quickly removed her bikini bottoms, while leaving her own panties on. Anne was only wearing a thin pair of low-rise panties and the skimpy panties had little straps and a tiny red bow in the front, but they were very short.</p> <p>While enjoying Susan’s reaction to her exhibitionism, Anne, who was still having a fairly intense orgasm, turned around, but without much self-abuse. In her mind she thought that she must have been blushing as she stared at her neighbor’s naked body. After Susan had finished cumming, there was no more holding each other's fingers against her so that they could remove the rest of the bikini bottom without much struggle. The two of them looked at each other and quickly turned their gaze away, but Anne was still horny. Susan was still laying there in the pool, but Anne quickly went into her own. They kissed again, and then Susan pulled away just as Anne’s climax was coming to a close. Still on the top, but with her skirt still on, they stood in the pool kissing, her bare tits pressing against the water, and then Susan's hand on her other breast. Anne had to resist pulling off Susan’s top so that she could reach her nipples without a bra. Susan moaned as Anne teased her nipples around her nipples with her fingertips, and then Susan turned to the side, pulling Anne, still with her hands wrapped around her waist, into her arms for a hot French kiss.</p> <p>When their kiss broke, Anne said with a grin, “That was fun, but I think that your top is almost soaked.” She took her own bikini bottom from Susan, stepped out of the pool, and laid down on the lounge chair. Susan didn’t hesitate and immediately removed her own top. As her nipples were still hard beneath Susan’s fingers, it was not surprising that she had another orgasm rather quickly. She did the same with Anne, and then she laid down next to Anne on the lounge chair, still with her hands by her side. Susan then turned her body so that her back was between Anne’s legs, and she began to gently rub Anne’s belly with her right hand while she lightly kissed Anne's left ear, then her neck and shoulders. When Susan finally had both women sufficiently aroused, she put a light kiss on each head, causing Anne to give out a little moan. Anne, as if in a daze, closed her eyes and began to rub her clitoris through her panties as she enjoyed Susan’s attention. Susan moved her head forward so that her mouth could get closer to Anne's earlobe and ear while she ran her fingers through the hair that covered Anne’s neck. She could tell that Anne was definitely getting turned on.</p> <p>Not long after Anne’s return to the pool, their own lust had been brought to full intensity. Susan had Anne on the edge of a mind-shattering orgasm while massaging her nipples with her hands. Susan decided that she’d have to bring Anne to orgasm herself, after all, and so she turned the tables on her neighbor. Anne seemed to understand what Susan wanted, so she responded with a kiss at Susan’s mouth. They rolled over and kissed, and continued caressed each other’s body, and hands and breasts, until Susan’s were completely satisfied. Then a hot again, then they continued with kisses. They took turns. They both at times again—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
