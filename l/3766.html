AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW</h4><p><strong>It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops</strong> of rain, which began to gather in an arc at the base of the tall, dark stone wall. The air was suddenly thick with warm, humid, fragrant, musky odour. It felt so good to be held by the hands that belonged to others, to feel their strength around me. It was only a matter of time until it was time to go home, and before I could think about anything else, an arm was draped around my neck, and a hand was rubbing my cock. I was hard yet again, and the hand was pumping the shaft up and down. "Don't worry about being late for work," said the voice over the sea. "Tomorrow's the big day."</p> <p>"Oh god..." moaned an anxious voice. "I've really gotta go, and I've gotta get a grip on this shit. Fuck, am I really gonna be a pain-slap when I get to my car? Oh, please fuck me." I was on the same page as the hand that was pumping me, as, with some encouragement from the sea, I bent my head down to the hand and gently licked the tip of it.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes," cried the voice, as a finger slid under its front and began to pull off the condom, which was still firmly encased in the thin, elastic skin of the plastic-covered shaft. The finger pulled its front slowly past the base and it slowly emerged the inside of the plastic as it was pulled back. I could see the condom and its contents, as it was peeled off and the hand pushed it back on. The hand turned to me with a grin in its eyes.</p> <p>"You're already in a hurry and eager girl," said the voice, with which I was about to reply. "I didn't even know you had a hard-on. It looks to me you're eager enough to finish off before you actually do."</p> <p>Before I could comprehend what she said, the hand pulled me off the floor by my cock and I felt herself standing next to me on the wet ground. She stepped over me and lay back on the wet stone wall. "Come on, baby. It's been too long. You can do me good," she cooed quietly while looking down at my cock, which had already sprung to attention. "Come here and fuck me, baby," she continued to say, while she gently pulled my head towards her.</p> <p>I didn't need asking twice. I knelt down next to the woman's thighs and felt her wet pussy against my face. I inhaled deeply through my nose and felt it being rubbed on my cheek by my tongue. I felt so horny, so eager for the woman's pleasure. I was so excited my tongue was soon working itself between her soft, pink lips. I ran my tongue up and down her wet slit, licked her slit from her bottom to top, before pushing my tongue as deep as I could into her pussy. I tasted her pussy, and felt the texture of her hair, and the dampness and smell. I didn't have to taste her. If my thoughts hadn't been driven by the sexual arousal of the moment, I might have, but I couldn't think about anything except how good it felt to have my tongue inside a warm, wet, wet pussy, licking up the wetness of her vagina, exploring the walls of her body, the softness of her skin, and the taste of her. And, as I licked and licked more and more into her, the sensation of the fingers gently pulling at my engorged cock and guiding me towards the entrance of her vagina, was the best that could be experienced. The finger that the tongue was working deep into her vagina was just the tip of one finger, which was moving back and forth inside her. I was almost delirious with the sexual gratification of having my cock's head inside a hot wet pussy.</p> <p>When I finally had to stop sucking her clit and plunge my tongue into her pussy, she held me right up to her, so that my cock slid between her legs. She pushed my face away from her. "That's enough," she said. "I want you to feel how good it is for me, when you fill me properly."</p> <p>She pulled off my face and stepped aside to let me get my bearings. I gazed at her as the water fell, letting the air move around my cock, while at the same time she looked straight down. What the hell was she looking at? She could see my rigid cock pointing straight as it strained towards the sky. She smiled and said, "Just wait. We can get together and have our first 'special' fuck together soon, at last."</p> <p>With that, she reached a hand to either side of my head and drew me, and drew my eyes to hers, she gently kissed me and said, "I'm yours. And I was yours."
