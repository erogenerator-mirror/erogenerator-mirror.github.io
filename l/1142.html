With that pronouncement she straddled my lap, and with all the experience we share, a slow journey of lust took place.</p> <p>When I began to stroke her clit her pussy was like a furnace, and when her eyes grew bigger her eyes said, "I love it! It's time for the cock!"</p> <p>While I did not know what it was like to fuck, if you are to fuck the girl of your dreams, the feeling of your cock inside her was what it was like to feel the sensation.</p> <p>I began to piston my cock in and out of her tight pussy as the pleasure built and built. As my cock penetrated within her, it was like being in a furnace, and I was in the midst of burning. The feeling became stronger, the heat spreading outwards into the room.</p> <p>I felt that orgasm come. It radiated out from the deepest part of her being through my cock. The feeling became sweeter by a thousand tiny points, like a wave of euphoria. I know that moment will never be the same.</p> <p>I began to pump her faster, and with greater vigour. As my cock was fucking her in both senses, the feeling became more intense. It began to become a tingle, and as the feeling began to get more intense, the heat became an inferno. The warmth was a kind of searing heat.</p> <p>As my cock was coming, too, the sensation spread out from my cock, and all manner of wonderful sensations coursed through my body. My dick was a living furnace, and although I am the same age as the person who was to be penetrated, I felt the heat spread out from my cock, down out towards the end of my shaft to that point, which I felt the tip of my cock being penetrated.</p> <p>I saw the fire in her eyes and that beautiful expression in her eyes, and felt the heat in her pussy. I felt the heat of her pussy growing stronger, and then with a roar she let out a loud grunt and began to tremble uncontrollably.</p> <p>I felt that moment of pure ecstasy, of the sensations in the deepest part of her being becoming more and more intense. I looked down at the expression of the intense feeling in my crotch, and for a while all I could do was stare at her in a mirror.</p> <p>Then with out any conscious thought I knew, I felt her mouth on mine. Our bodies were pressed firmly together as our kiss was deep, passionate as our sexual encounter. We were fucking each other in our minds. We were kissing. It was the moment of absolute fulfillment.</p> <p>I felt with love for her. That feeling of love could be seen in my eyes. I felt as if I am with a lover. I felt her pussy tightening and releasing around my cock, and it caused a flood of sensations, and when I felt that I could not control myself any more I felt the cum boiling in my balls.</p> <p>"Cum for me! Oh, my wonderful man, cum inside me!" she cried.</p> <p>I felt the pulsing of my cock and the first of the waves of my orgasm as I felt the pulsing of her pussy. "Yes, baby! Yes, like that! Yes! That's it, baby!" she cried as she started to climax herself.</p> <p>I felt the orgasm wash over me as it did its initial impact, as waves of pleasure overcame me as I shot my sperm inside her pussy.</p> <p>When my penis had stopped pulsating, she collapsed on me, and after lying there for a minute or so, I was able to breathe, to think, to gather my courage. I had done what I had wanted to do for my dream. It had just turned into a nightmare! Then when I felt her mouth on mine again, when our lips were together once again, I felt both a sense of relief and a new joy.</p> <p>She began kissing me and felt that I felt the same way. The love I had felt for her was a big step in the process of building our bond.</p> <p>She said, "I've wanted to do that for so long, and she has kissed me just as surely."</p> <p>"I want to do the same." I said</p> <p>"That sounds so romantic. It is so romantic for both of us," she said</p> <p>"No, I don't feel comfortable in a conventional relationship like that. I don't feel comfortable about it." I didn't know what to say.</p> <p>"I didn't think you were too shy."</p> <p>"No, I'm not," I said, and with that said, we embraced.<|end> "This is</p> <p><|end<|>(I'm<|end><|> <|> <|end<|end> |></p> <p><|></p> <p>|”And that night—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
