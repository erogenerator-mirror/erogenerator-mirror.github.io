Nothing."</p> <p>"But you'll be, if you carry out your duties like men: you'll be, by all means, men."</p> <p>"Yes," he replied, "it's true."</p> <p>"But you shall be, just as a man, you'll be a man, like the woman that came up with you."</p> <p>"Yes. Perhaps so, but surely not if all men are like a man is."</p> <p>"I don't."</p> <p>"Why not? Because men were not like men. A man was no longer a man. Why not a man?"</p> <p>"This is stupid!"</p> <p>"And so am I! Do you understand?"</p> <p>"Don't look," he grinned and pulled the towel around himself and took a sip of tea from it. He knew what it was.</p> <p>She thought he was looking at her.</p> <p>"No," she said, "just look."</p> <p>"And you will do what you must to achieve it," he said smiling again.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"And then I shall be all right."</p> <p>This was the moment she would wait a year for when she would be permitted to take a man on. This was the moment of her first male lover, the day they knew each other and had shared the joy of having sex with each other at last; an experience that she would again savour for ever.</p> <p>But there may be a time when it was not just the physicality of their lives that brought her pleasure, but also of the fact that she would be given the pleasure of having a man on top of her. For she loved the power of the man atop her and it would be her pleasure as well as the pleasure of the man being inside her; the pleasure that would be given the man's sperm, his seed.</p> <p>She reached between them and found his penis, which, she thought, was still quite hard. She held it as she looked downwards into his eyes and, smiling, she pushed it between her legs again. He looked at her with the same intensity of his eyes she had seen on his face.</p> <p>"You are beautiful," he said smiling in reply and, before withdrawing, he kissed her nose and told her,</p> <p>"You are sexy."</p> <p>"Thank you, darling," She answered smiling again, "You are so good."</p> <p>With that she put down her tea cup and walked to the bedroom door. She entered the room and turned the doorknob. As it opened, the bedside light went out. She moved towards the wardrobe and opened it a little and found a small chest. Inside was a small, white brassiere, perhaps containing perhaps the same sort of underwear as the ones she was wearing at the restaurant, but her bra would have been better: it was a brassiere that allowed her to wear only a top button loose at the top, thus the way that her breasts would have accommodated her breasts in their more feminine forms.</p> <p>She took the brassiere off and found a tiny brassiere. She took it all the way off and now stood naked before him. She smiled and said, "You have such a lovely face," and she reached for it, so that it covered her breasts completely. She knew she had achieved the same effect, the way that she had achieved her first male lover, the way that she always loved it: the way that a man had given each of her, not just his penis, but that he had given her his sperm. This pleased her. This pleased her hugely.</p> <p>As she leaned forward so that she could kiss him again he turned her around and pushed her against the wardrobe's wardrobe. He bent to open the wardrobe door and took her to the bed. They got onto the bed and they made love and they made love. It turned out to be one of the most beautiful days of her life.</p> <p>The day started out with the most wonderful sex and they both loved. During the day a man could be seen by women who smiled and laughed, but the sight was not for them; it was for them. And whenever he was present, they got pleasure in knowing that it was a man, not some woman, who fucked the man. That was how it was for them. When it was time for him to be taken home, they had sex together in the same bed or in the same room. As for now, they were happy to be alone together but they wanted to fuck more than be with an empty lovers. The Man and empty lover would make love. S were always the same for him. There were times when women who had their men together they always they had love.
