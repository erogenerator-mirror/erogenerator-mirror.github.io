M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXXV. The Winter at Queen’s</h4><p><strong>ANNE’S homesickness wore off, greatly helped in the wearing by her weekend visits home. As long as the open weather lasted the Avonlea students went out to Carmody on the</strong> 23rd to meet Mike and Paula.</p> <p>Paula was already in her room preparing her makeup when the two women joined her in dressing for their Saturday activities. As they undressed each other, they were amazed at their appearance. Not that their beauty was lacking in one way or another. Their clothes were all made up; Paula's hair was long and wavy and Mike's was straight-line blond. Paula and Mike both carried their short hair carefully and wore a pair of sunglasses.</p> <p>"How do I look?" Paula asked.</p> <p>"Wonderful. Your eyes are so pretty," said Mike as he pulled her into his arms. They kissed passionately while running their hands all over each other’s bodies.</p> <p>They had never had sex before and now they each wondered how the other’s body and especially Paula's body were going to fit into their minds.</p> <p>Mike's hands caressed the silky skin of Paula’s waist and slowly made their way up to her breasts. Paula took his hand and brought it to her tit. Mike played with her tits until her eyes closed and she began to moan and push his hand on her breast.</p> <p>As Mike’s finger rubbed her nipple, Paula felt her hips begin to move. She felt a tingling between her legs. Mike kissed her as he inserted one hand between their bodies until it covered Paula’s pussy and his fingers began to rub her clit.</p> <p>In an instant Paula screamed, "Oh, Mike!" as she came.</p> <p>Paula felt Mike’s cock growing hard as he watched a woman coming under him, so he turned her around so his hard cock would enter her.</p> <p>Mike lifted Paula’s body and slammed it into her as Paula screamed in ecstasy. Mike continued to fuck her until Paula was ready to pass out.</p> <p>After Mike’s cock erupted inside Paula, Paula smiled and said, "You liked having a hard dick sliding in and out of you," She reached down to pull his cock out before saying to Mike, "You’re one crazy fuck."</p> <p>Mike kissed Paula, then they moved behind her on the bed so that they could kiss. Their tongues explored each other in between them.</p> <p>Paula moved down Mike’s body as she kissed him. She licked his face before sucking his tongue and then kissing his neck.</p> <p>"You’re making me horny," he said as he moved his hands up Paula’s body to caress her nipples.</p> <p>Paula’s hands had been under Mike’s shirt, and she caressed him there too. They licked each other’s nipples, which Paula loved. As Mike’s hands caressed Paula’s tits, she caressed his cock.</p> <p>At last they were satisfied. They showered, got dressed and returned to their classes. On the way back to the dorm Mike kissed Paula on the lips, then whispered, "Your lips are so soft."</p> <p>"I like being kissed by you too," Paula answered.</p> <p>Mike kissed her and held Paula’s face in his hands.</p> <p>Two weeks later while their friends were leaving for a trip they had just finished for the first time in a week, Mike and Paula kissed and held each other. They never did anything more than kiss once.</p> <p>Their relationship continued to develop but that is another chapter for another part of the story—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
