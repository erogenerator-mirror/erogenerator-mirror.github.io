English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LXV. THE MAGICIAN.</h4><p><strong>When however Zarathustra had gone round a rock, then saw he on the same path, not far below him, a man who threw his limbs about like a maniac, and</strong> said, you fucking lucky shit's not my name and how did you know my name?"</p> <p>"Because you said I'd been talking so many fucking names...you fucking horny fuck."</p> <p>"You're not so damn sure this is a hot movie, are you?"</p> <p>"I've got the camera, and I'm the man...the only word you are going to use to describe me," I replied back.</p> <p>He put the camera down and the lights turned on. It was still pitch black in the dark, but the dark had given way to the lights behind us.</p> <p>"Why don't we go on in your big ol' black dildo on the floor. We'll both be able to see it."</p> <p>"You want me to turn down all the lights?"</p> <p>"I don't know...why don't we both just walk up to it and see if you can see anything."</p> <p>"Why don't YOU do what?!"</p> <p>"Go and stand next to the big-topping one," I replied, and as he walked up to the rock a little ways, I took out my dildo. He said it was black so I put mine on top of the pink one I had been wearing. It looked amazing on the black, as he picked it up. I was in awe of finally touching another man's cock. He had his cock at full mast and was moaning like an insane manly beast.</p> <p>He knelt down next to my dildo and placed it on my cock. He gently moved it up and down my cock with his hand. And once it settled against my cock, I grabbed it and pumped slowly. He looked at me with a smirk and said, what the hell!...you going to be fucked by my cock! I was so out of my fucking mind, that he never seemed to hear I said that aloud.</p> <p>And fuck me, he did. He lifted himself up so his face was near my cock. He looked up at me with a smirk, and after he made sure that it would never go anywhere else, he licked his lips and told me, I want to taste your cock.</p> <p>"Suck it."</p> <p>I was confused by this sudden command.</p> <p>"What?!" I heard, as I saw that his lip went and went up his teeth in something. Whatever it was, it was dark so I didn't like to be interrupted from the sight of it.</p> <p>"Suck my cock."</p> <p>I was aghast when he said this, and in an immediate response was wondering what that was?</p> <p>"Come on, go on, I'm fucking dying to have my cock inside you. It's ok, don't worry about me, go on, suck it, fuck it with your warm wet mouth."</p> <p>So I kissed the head of his dick and held it and held it as I licked his cock.</p> <p>"Yes, suck my cock, make it hard for you, suck it harder," he encouraged. "Suck it hard, you fucking horny fuck."</p> <p>I went back and forth all over his dick, taking it down to the balls and licking and sucking on it. It was like he was fucking my sweet mouth for the millionth time ever.</p> <p>I looked into his eyes and saw no condemnation or regret at all over doing the things I'd just watched him do. I felt safe and cherished as I slowly began pumping my dick for him.</p> <p>It felt wonderful. I couldn't believe I'd really done it, and it felt absolutely incredible. When he put his hand up and cupped my balls, I knew I just had to do this with him.</p> <p>After only a few strokes, he gently pulled on my balls which had never been touched before. He said, I don't know if it's a pornstar thing, or just the way you guys are used in sex as porn actors. But that's exactly the way I felt as I was sucking away.</p> <p>He didn't put my dick in his mouth, or put me in his mouth, but he kept licking and sucking on it and telling me how good it felt, how much it'd been making him feel.</p> <p>My breathing changed and it felt as though his cock was going to come out of his mouth, that it was going to burst.</p> <p>I felt this rush, as if I had to pee. I put my hands on my dick which started to jump, so I knew that it wasn't going to be long before I came. And like that, his mouth took over from the dick and his tongue and hands went, as if to make sure that as much as it could go, it was going to be sucking me too.</p> <p></p> <p>and it was. You're fuckin'. We'll's'' and will and''. and''. and''cause''. â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
