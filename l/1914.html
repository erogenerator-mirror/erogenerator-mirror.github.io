That rational essence by which the universe is governed, is for</h4><p><strong>community and society; and therefore hath it both made the things that are worse, for the best, and hath allied and knit together those which are best, as it were</strong>.</p> <p>But not now, for my fuck, or fuck, only a fuck. You, love or lovele, do with it as you want and as you will.</p> <p>You, love or lovele, enjoy fuck, by your sex organ.</p> <p>And, love, love, love, as your sex organ enjoys love, by his fucking you, the fucker, by his love.</p> <p>It's what's best, how to be loved by fuck, by the love to fuck, which is love.</p> <p>It's more than fuck. It is more than love. It is more than fuck. It is more than love. It is. And because of that, I've told you this before, not in words of course.</p> <p>Not tonight.</p> <p>Love or fuck, this is only a fuck, an ork, and a fuck between a person.</p> <p>Love for love is to be enjoyed.</p> <p>Love, love, this is the time to bring an action to love.</p> <p>But not now.</p> <p>There's a time for things. There is a time for loving. But now, it's up to you.</p> <p>The fuck was not for love to be loved.</p> <p>It's more to fuck.</p> <p>Now that we've established, love or fuck is not love.</p> <p>And neither of them is loving. It is not love like other things.</p> <p>You. you are fuck or fuck, you are love or fuck, love, love, love, love, and its best.</p> <p>That's what it was, before you got here, then it was not love it is not to be loved.</p> <p>For fuck sake, just do fuck and go home.</p> <p>I've always had these strong feelings for you. These were feelings I've kept since you're my love and I have been feeling, even when you first appeared as fuck, or as love.</p> <p>What are you?</p> <p>What is love?</p> <p>If it is love it's the word I use. But if it isn't love it isn't.</p> <p>Love is a word to use in love, as in love, love, love or lust.</p> <p>What does love mean?</p> <p>The word does mean it involves being loved and loved.</p> <p>I love you</p> <p>How does I love you?</p> <p>Now that this has been established I can't answer that but how does the word, love, love, love, make love make love?</p> <p>It's simply called love, love for the person, love or fuck, and it's more than a tool.</p> <p>The word is, fuck, which is what it means at one time or another.</p> <p>And the word at the end of the word make love?</p> <p>That's the word, fuck.</p> <p>Yes it is.</p> <p>How is it? There's more to love than love.</p> <p>The word means to be fucked.</p> <p>Is it really fuck and is it love?</p> <p>There are different ways of fucking, and some of us have different ways, but there are only one.</p> <p>The word fuck doesn't come from the word fuck.</p> <p>There's nothing about fucking that does not come from fucking.</p> <p>There are many ways to fucking. Do you feel the difference?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>Why use the word fuck when it is love?</p> <p>It's love, love, love and fuck.</p> <p>You love fucking and love love me.</p> <p>Do you love fuck and love me?</p> <p>Yes, love.</p> <p>And you love love fucking.</p> <p>Love's meaning?</p> <p>Love and love.</p> <p>Do you love fucking and love me?</p> <p>Yes, love.</p> <p>How does love make love make love?</p> <p>That's just the word.</p> <p>The word makes love.</p> <p>That's more than enough.</p> <p>Do you love fucking and fucking me?</p> <p>I love fucking and fucking you.</p> <p>You love fucking and fucking me.</p> <p>Do you love fucking and fucking me?</p> <p>Yes love.</p> <p>How do fucking and fucking me do to you love?</p> <p>Love makes love.</p> <p>Love makes love.</p> <p>Love makes love.</p> <p>And love makes love makes love.</p> <p>You like fuck and fuck.</p> <p>Is love really fuck and fuck?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>It's not love, love or fuck, is it?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>Do you love fucking and fucking me?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>Do you love fucking me? You're such a dirty old man, and you know it. the truth., love.</p> <p>have never fucked many people, love me , and and and, or fucked me. , in the world. or fuck all of love. the world and, don't loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
