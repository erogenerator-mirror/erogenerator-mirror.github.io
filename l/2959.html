And now, when you are with me, we are to learn the subjects by heart.</p> <p>It was, with much difficulty, the first time we were together. We had met during college after a break and, having to take courses in English, I had decided to follow in her lead. I had to do a double-double for English; and, that meant, me not able to pick her up.</p> <p>One Saturday, our first class went really nicely. We ended up to talk about books and history, or about the first time we were to be together. She had a serious crush on me. It was something that I had only been thinking about, looking at her. She was about five-five, about thirty-two, with long dark hair and gorgeous eyes. (She hadn't bothered wearing a bra.) She looked about ten years younger than I did. She was wearing a pale yellow tank top with what appeared to be half a dozen buttons down the front showing off her flat belly. I was wearing a plain cotton shirt with faded blue jeans and a cowboy hat. Our classes had been rather boring until something else happened between us.</p> <p>We had been taking English class for about a half hour. She stood up, putting her hands over her bra, and I put mine back on her stomach. I reached behind myself, and pulled her down onto the couch, kneeling in front of her, and started kissing her breasts. She was breathing hard. The feeling was nice, and she leaned her head back, closed her eyes and sighed, and then opened her eyes again. Her mouth opened and she moaned in pleasure.</p> <p>I licked her belly button as I undid her pants, kissing along the inside of her thighs. She parted her legs, and I pulled them off as I put my face in her pussy.</p> <p>I was just getting started.</p> <p>I started licking softly at first, then moving faster and more aggressively, working first one, then two fingers into her pussy while my lips and tongue began to lick and suck her clitoris, which was now standing straight out toward me. She made quiet grunting sounds and her breathing grew faster and deeper. I moved my tongue up and down her slit several times, going from her asshole to her clit, getting it erect and wet and then diving back in for a lick. She was breathing hard and moaned a little louder now, even louder, than before. "Oh—oh! You're doing it to me—ohhhh—that's so good." She moaned more, and I sucked her clit harder—oh yes, you can do it to me—keep doing that.</p> <p>When I moved my tongue around her clit, I could feel it rising to the occasion. She suddenly gasped, and started writhing on the couch. I pushed my fingers inside her pussy with one hand, while pulling on the inside of her thighs with the other.</p> <p>"Oh, oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!" She yelled loudly as she was wracked by an intense orgasm. When it was over, I moved up beside her. "Do you have any idea how long it was?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you think I can take that?" She didn't answer. I moved toward her. I put her head down on the arm of the sofa, and she curled up beside of me. I leaned my head down so that my cheek was against hers. She kissed me softly. "Oh, my God," she said, "that was fabulous. It was better than ever before. It's been like that for years."</p> <p>"I guess," I said. "I really didn't get to do it like that before. And, I certainly didn't get to enjoy you either."</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" she said. "I was a little embarrassed. I am not usually like that."</p> <p>"Me either," I replied with a smile. "I really enjoyed it."</p> <p>She nodded. "It was also—a little bit—a turn-on for me, too."</p> <p>"I know," I replied. "I thought it was kind of hot."</p> <p>"It was—it's been a while since I did anything with a woman," she said.</p> <p>"That's not true, either. You're a woman now. A woman's right. And, I know you don't just watch porn videos."</p> <p>"I do. But, I really like the way it makes you feel." She looked at me, and ran a hand down my face, under my hat, to my lips. "I love the way your lips feel around mine. Are they as soft and hot as those of yours?"</p> <p>"Mmmmmmuh uh-hm" a little, ahhh"</p> <p>ah, not-uh"mm"Mmmm, good." She leaned in her fingers on my neck—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
