Breakfast.</h4><p><strong>I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a</strong> long time ago. We were soon talking again, with the mutual attraction of old friends.</p> <p>"So you're not a werewolf..."</p> <p>"Why do you worry?"</p> <p>"That my brother is going to be a hunk."</p> <p>"I know, but I'm not exactly an ideal specimen at the moment." He leaned forward and nuzzled the neckline of my blouse with his nose, giving me a good sniff before nibbling a bit more. I shuddered, and he grinned, licking a long slow stripe across my collarbone. He looked up at me, still grinning, and reached into my blouse for one of my breasts. He played with it, while I looked back at him with a shy smile. That had been long ago, and much more fun. He had made me cum too much, but he paid me very well.</p> <p>"Don't say that, you bastard!" He started to take off my bra, and I giggled and put my hands on his shirt. "Oh, god, I'd love it, if you'd do it for me..."</p> <p>It wasn't an easy task, and I wanted it. It's not like he would hurt me, or anything, right? But he didn't do it this time; he took off my jeans, and I let him take my sneakers off before he pulled off my socks. I lifted my ass to help him in, and I felt his cock sliding into me. Not the most comfortable position, but enough for us both.</p> <p>"Oh!" I gasped when I felt him in me, my walls tightening around him.</p> <p>"It...it doesn't hurt you?"</p> <p>"No, nothing that bad." I was very happy to feel him inside me so clearly.</p> <p>"Good. I'm not the biggest guy you could ask to fuck you, but I sure can get it up." He smiled up at me, and his eyes were sparkling. I smiled back at him, and pulled off my panties. He pulled up my legs and lay them over his shoulders before plunging back inside.</p> <p>"That's...that's so tight!" he gasped as he went deeper inside me. I spread my legs wider, giving him all of me before he pulled out and slammed back inside me. I squatted over him as much as he could, feeling him sliding inside me, and he began to groan.</p> <p>"You...are...fucking...bad..."</p> <p>"I'm not," I admitted with a smile. "I'm saving myself."</p> <p>He looked right back up at me, and it made me tingle as he continued to pound into me. "It doesn't hurt at all, does it?" I asked, sliding my hands up his chest and rubbing my nails over his nipples.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah...I wouldn't want you to be the only were to get it up."</p> <p>"Fuck! Now, get me back on the bench. I want fucked. I want to feel you in me."</p> <p>He grunted and tried to pull me back into me with one arm, but there was no real resistance. He fucked me, and all that mattered to me was getting his cock in me. I spread my legs and began to ride up and down on his cock, and he groaned.</p> <p>"Yeah...yesssss. Oh, fuck, I'm gonna cum!" I knew I'd do anything for him, if his was up to it.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, just like that. Fill my ass, baby! Gimme there!"</p> <p>"I'll do my best." We both groaned as I felt his cock explode inside me.</p> <p>"I love you so much!" We didn't move while we were still on the bench, though, and he kissed me, and pulled from my body and left the bar-room. He came back with a towel wrapped around him so that he could wash off all of our lovemaking. He then stood where he'd been, staring out at the street.</p> <p>"Do I look ok?"</p> <p>"Of course...you look good. You should be ashamed of yourself."</p> <p>I laughed. "I should be the one feeling ashamed, but I can't help it. I've never cum like that before."</p> <p>"You're a beautiful slut."</p> <p>"It's not about saying that. I'm never ashamed of anything."</p> <p>"I feel the same way."</p> <p>"Do you mind if I stay here with you today?"</p> <p>"Of course you wanna stay with me. Let's just finish our joint." this bottle of beer...whatever you know?" I really wanted it." the fact I'd want to finish my time out. He'd go on later, and I did it. So long. .</p> <p>he's time to finishâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
