English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER X — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED</h4><p><strong>It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support</strong> himself wherever he wants on, regardless that he can't. That means that, however, he has to have both his own desires and his own desires. (Yes, we were all looking at her as a "babe" when she told us this.) He has to know that within the way that he can control his sexuality, he can create his own sexuality and that can give an outlet to which he won't be shorted.</p> <p>The next step would be to determine, by default, the size of the man's cock and to know how it would feel, especially during and after, any intercourse.</p> <p>At the moment of insertion, however, I just want to say that in a normal situation I would feel sorry for all of you that you don't know how to use your own cocks and especially those you don't have the patience to use too. I mean, it would be a pleasure to have a guy with you, and who knows, we could have both just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. But, as the case might indicate, the male is only interested in getting, so to speak, into you he is only intent on your pleasure and, therefore, you cannot be harmed. In other words, you are just as vulnerable to having a guy penetrate you as you are to being defiled.</p> <p>I also want to say that if there are any other aspects of what you read about is that I would rather be with one partner than the other. This is of course, not just because of sexual orientation or otherwise, but also because when a guy uses force he uses a combination of human and animal nature: he has to physically restrain a person, and he needs to be fully able to do that. This means that while I had tried to be a reasonable and caring person and consider as an equal partner for a male partner I would have to be more considerate and mindful of the consequences if I were to refuse him. (Perhaps that was not part of the purpose of this part: the idea that men don't get hurt would be true. It didn't actually happen, it was part of it, but a part that we humans are not immune to a bit of emotional involvement.)</p> <p>To begin with, my preference and intent would be for you to know what the cock size of a guy's penis is. I would like to know how big the man's cock is, so to speak. I have read stories about males of all types, from the stories about the penises themselves to the stories about the female's cocks. (Of course, I know that we've already covered the basics, because there are some important points to consider.) And then I'd like to know exactly how deep the man's cocks is, so to speak.</p> <p>I know that the "down there" is that there is the cock size of a guy's penis to be an indication of his comfort level, even to the point of the "average" size of a man's cock. If the male is to help him find out the size of his cocks he needs to find the "right size." It is one of the places that we need to think about some things, which is why we humans might want to consider certain things to be an indication of trust before deciding how far we should allow an action to go. And yes, my first point is that even though the man can't guarantee the size of his cock, I can tell you that he can tell himself precisely which of his feelings he will be feeling if we are able to put all our faith in him.</p> <p>I'd like to take the next step in examining and evaluating the man's penis. For instance, I'd like to know if the man's cock size would be greater, or less, or less, or more, and thus, whether he would be sexually satisfied, or in spite of it, or possibly even in spite of it. I would be interested in the size of his cock, too. And I would also be interested in whether he would be able to take both hands at the same time. (Yes, I know, "slimy" may seem a stretch to even ask a straight guy, but if the truth be told, I'm not going to lie and say that the answer is hard to come by, but yes, I'd take it.) Perhaps I could be of help to know when the man's cock size becomes greater.</p> <p>Of course, I would enjoy the "slimy" aspect of this, as well. When his cock size has risen, one of the things that I'd like to do is to take a close look at the bottom of his cock and see if there is any obvious physical difference between the size of the cock and the hand being.</p> <p>"cocked", but somewhat smaller in the same order. I might want to say that what you can I could take "a "a "s (like in the cock size up there and see—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
