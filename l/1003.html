Poor Cosette said nothing. As she had seated herself beside him</strong>, his cock came free from the confines of her cotton pants. She began fingering her clit as he continued pumping his hard cock, which she could feel beginning to thicken. The sound of her own fingers against her clit made her head reel with feelings of pleasure and danger flooding her entire body. She moaned in delight, but she didn’t want him to stop. His breathing became deeper and deeper, and more of his shaft disappeared inside her. She was too far-gone, and he was too far-gone. She stopped playing with her clit long enough to remove her shirt.</p> <p>“Wait,” she said. “Don’t go. Just fuck me. Let me have it.” With one last push, she wrapped one of her legs around his body, and slid her soaked and cum-streaked pussy lips over his shaft while she tried to hold back her sudden orgasm for as long as possible. She wanted to come so badly she could taste it.</p> <p>Before she knew what had happened, he had already entered her in long, full strokes and began hammering back hard with long, deep strokes. She was almost afraid to let out a loud cry. When she finally relaxed, she could hold her breath. All of the years of repression that she had built up to this point would be shattered with a blow like that. As she began to scream, she wrapped her legs around his waist and he continued to fuck her fiercely. She thought she heard him chuckle as he reached around and stroked her nipples. She could feel her orgasm growing closer and closer and knew that she was seconds away from cumming. She would not be able to hold on much longer. They both went silent and both came simultaneously at the same time. Her body convulsed as she let go. Her pussy clenched around him once more and he too exploded inside her once more.</p> <p>They lay in each other’s arms after their powerful climax, lost in the passion and emotion of the moment. They looked at each other and smiled.</p> <p>“That was the best sex I’ve had in a long time,” he said. “We've got to do it again sometime.” He began to untie her.</p> <p>“What’s this about being with people like me?” she responded.</p> <p>“It’s always been with Cosette. She always said that no matter how much you liked sex, you might not think about making love to someone else.” He pulled the band-aid from under her hair.</p> <p>“I don’t think about it,” she said and ran her fingers through his chest hair and felt his cock twitching again. “I just feel like we belong together.” She kissed him lightly, but knew all was not lost. It would never be that simple again.</p> <p>This is just what Cosette had hoped for.</p> <p>*”Cosette - This is your story, where I take your virginity, where we spend eternity together.”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
