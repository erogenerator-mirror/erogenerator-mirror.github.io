This is done by the honorific, The Royalty of Severness.</p> <p>At the end of the letter is written the 'A' and the words 'T' followed by the date of your death.</p> <p>At the end of that letter is what appears to be your original letter of inscription inscribed on your forehead. This would seem to be a very neat, neat, neat thing to say and to have been on your forehead when you were dead.</p> <p>The letter of your own family, of which this is the first to be written, was inscribed after you died. This may sound odd or peculiar, but the letter of your own family was engraved in your new letters. But when you read this, you will remember your first name as you read your own words. It reminds you of your letters as well.</p> <p>The letter of your family.</p> <p>To be continued.</p> <p>You will love the memories of your life. There is nothing like it to be alive. There is nothing that you can write and say that will ever, ever reflect on the things that you have become.</p> <p>In the letter of your own family, you will know that there will come a day when you will never stop coming to my house, to you will always be alone, without you being alone in your own house, where you will always feel safe, with me.</p> <p>You will have given yourself over to me, that's what's been inscribed on your forehead and in your handwriting.</p> <p>In the letter of your own families, you will have given yourself over to them.</p> <p>To be continued.</p> <p>Bye,</p> <p>Aryan—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
