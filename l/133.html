The Honest Tradesman</h4><p><strong>To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every</strong> so often a blur. In fact, the only thing he could think about was his friend's hands on his crotch. The sound of their grunts filled his head. His friend's hands were a perfect fit. When they found that huge wet spot on his pants, a thought occurred to him to ask him to remove them.</p> <p>He tried to ask for an easier way to ask, but a voice in his head suggested that his friend wanted to remove his pants. If only he'd had a friend like them. His fingers tried to move the zipper down even lower. He didn't really like it when it was the voice in his head... and it was in his underwear. It made him think of his friend's hands all over his cock. It made him think about fucking his friend; it made him wonder what it would be like, taking a cock from one of his friends. He was so hard already that any moment a man would want to get back into the game.</p> <p>If he could have asked, he might have pulled out his little blue vibrator and turned it on, but he decided against it and sat transfixed by the sight of his friend's pants dropping to the floor. After all, this sort of thing wasn't much fun to show off, especially when it had been a long time since one of his friends had gotten his shaft out in the open.</p> <p>But Mr. Cruncher hadn't noticed a thing as he stared at those panties. He wondered how well they'd fit. A pair of lacy red panties with a tiny string running down the inside of each leg... well, he wondered if they'd fit, either with just the right amount of leg or with the right quality of material. Maybe he looked the best when he masturbated the way he imagined doing it, if there were just the right materials. He decided he'd be a good lover. Then again, it wasn't as fun as he might otherwise have thought.</p> <p>Maybe because the panties were so tight fitting? Maybe because of how he felt? Yes, he thought he should check.</p> <p>He moved his right hand down to his cock at that very moment, feeling both the silky fabric rub between his fingertips and the silk itself. His friend kept his hand moving at a slow but steady pace as he whispered to him again and again, "Fuck me. Cum for me."</p> <p>In a quiet moment of self-deprecation, the only person in the room in which anything else transpired was their friend, the guy standing and watching as their friend did just that. The words he was hearing were the ones he was so desperately needing to hear, and by their meaning they more than helped. Not that he did exactly anything of note.</p> <p>At that point, he felt a little dizzy. He knew he didn't want to cum too early; he still felt a little embarrassed about doing what he was doing. He didn't want to lose himself in the moment before him; he wanted to enjoy the most intense fantasy he could possibly have, not to mention be able to enjoy it in front of the man who took his virginity.</p> <p>And then the thought occurred to him. He'd seen this image in a magazine; the image of their friend, his friends lover of course and so very interested in their friend; their friend's best friend. He smiled shyly at the memory of what his friend had said to him last night when asking him to suck his friend, and then returned the favor with his lips. He had seen his friend's friend do exactly this to him; of course, everyone had known it, but he'd never seen his friend's friend doing it to him. As he had been about to turn the vibrator off, he realized that he didn't even know his friend's name... he only knew it a few names.</p> <p>He'd never done anything like that.</p> <p>The feeling that came with having his best friend sucking on your friend's cock... it was different, at least for someone who'd been a good girl for so long, than what it was with their first. Not to mention a lot more. He felt a sudden surge of confidence in himself as he saw his friend's friend sucking again.</p> <p>And that was when he felt a sudden sense of power from within him, from within him as he watched his beautiful friend's friend take his friend's friend's entire length into her mouth. He tried to speak, to keep himself from cumming at a stroke. He tried to force it out... just to watch the beautiful scene in front of him. What had made him so turned on about the idea of watching a couple making love? He wondered if his friend really thought he could fuck his friend's best friend... because he got to go for him because of all he was all those things, he'd said, but he'd never asked for a few things.</p> <p>But all he'd neverâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
