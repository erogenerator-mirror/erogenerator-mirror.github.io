And there be but two things which make</strong> it worth waiting till we are twenty.</p> <p>The first thing that we learn is how to pleasure a woman. And as a woman we have three very important lessons which we must learn before we can truly know it.</p> <p>Remember that your mouth is small. And because you use lots of teeth you will probably need teeth for a cock. Don't worry though. When a woman takes it in her hand and she feels her lips touch the cock head she will remember as such and you will know then that it feels like a cock. But remember don't worry. Remember you won't need your hands for your hand is nice as it is.</p> <p>The mouth of a pussy would probably feel nice, and the mouth of a mouth on her breasts would perhaps be nice, and the mouth of a pussy would definitely feel nice. However, your cock and her mouth have always had the magic of pleasure and you don't actually ever need to think about where your cock might actually find its pleasure, if that is what you are about to do. We learned that very early that I might be wrong about you, however, if I hadn't gotten all these lessons by now I would have said that if you would just go fuck her in your best position to enter your lady-woman's pussy from behind. That is indeed, even if I had never done it myself.</p> <p>Don't read into the next lesson; remember the first part, the foreplay. The foreplay, the preparation the pussy needs to be wet and ready for a man.</p> <p>Now, as a woman you'll need to suck her nipples, which are always very nice, and you must always gently suck them. If she is not very hot for you you must use plenty of lubrication. This is always necessary if you intend to fuck her. Her nipples always feel wonderfully soft and warm in your mouth. And as my dear you will know this is important here, you must also be used to be the recipient of pleasure in her body as well. Of course the pleasure is of her pleasure, not of yours. And as her nurse, you will learn how to love her body so that you can properly pleasure it, and hopefully you will have your own pleasure. But you must also remember that if you suck her nipples, her breasts she will always take pleasure in your mouth, as her pleasure is hers to use, and if you suck her nipples you will be more pleased and more pleased. And while sucking her nipple it will never take more than a moment's time for you to learn. It will not be just to have her body enjoy your attentions, but also to enjoy her tits and nipples. She will always appreciate having her nipples sucked.</p> <p>Now what? I don't know, but I don't usually do it anymore. But as I've said before this lesson was too much for me to just go to sleep and sleep on a blanket with you. Maybe I would just stay up a little longer but...</p> <p>Now you must be careful not to say a word just because there are other ladies out there, but women like you are not a man. Well, not really, but you do have a chance there but that's just the extent of your learning.</p> <p>Now my dear how are you going to go about having sex with you? It's only for you and only you as the man who gives it to you and only you. But of course you might have to be more enthusiastic and more enthusiastic. Just think it, you'll have to do some exercises to get the girls to do their jobs in bed. And they probably can't handle the cock if they do it for themselves. However, sometimes they'll be just as interested in your pleasure as they really are.</p> <p>So how can you have sex in this house?</p> <p>In the house it's a strange situation, one you should never forget. In the world men, especially when they see their women and think of their woman, are much more sensitive than they think. Some men think of themselves as being more attentive to their woman, that they are paying attention to it and are in control of themselves as it arises so naturally. You are always right on the point; you will always be right. Men are not always so attentive as they are always saying that they are being more attentive than they are. Some men might actually go a little overboard in trying to get what they want, for whatever reason.</p> <p>Men can't understand how their women are enjoying sex. And if they didn't enjoy it then, what could they have said to you? Maybe they didn't think they liked sex, or maybe it didn't help them feel better, after all, they are usually so selfish and they don't realize not what's good sex even half the fun.</p> <p>If a woman wants to enjoy sex, and thinks of her man is more attentive she should love him, and do that what to. Then, then do for him and have him and love and not loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
