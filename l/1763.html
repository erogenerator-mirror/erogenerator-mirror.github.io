HISTORY OF A LEAVENED CAKE OF MAIZE.</h4><p><strong>At the epoch of this history, the cell in the Tour-Roland was occupied.

The school was large and contained a hundred children attending the age of thirteen. The school president, Miss Henderson, was a short girl who had been in the army for a decade. Her name was Janice Henderson, a year or two ahead of Mrs. Henderson.</p> <p>The school, a small four-bedroom ranch house a few miles along the river, was used by Mrs. Henderson, a widow in her late forties to early fifties. Her daughter was a senior in high school.</p> <p>"We have a small but very good staff here," the school president said before turning to begin the last of the class. "I think you may find the first thing you need to know when you're in Miss Henderson's class is how to make your mind up about whether or not to go into her class."</p> <p>"Yes ma'am," the class leader said before giving Miss Henderson a nod. "I understand what you might think of me in class and I know that I'll be a fine teacher. I need just a little luck."</p> <p>The class leader watched Miss Henderson for a moment before continuing. She was a tall fellow with glasses and a long face. She was wearing a pink blouse that was nearly see-through except that her bra was still in place. Her skirt wasn't that short as it was when she was sitting in front of a teacher and her shoes were white.</p> <p>She had her hair pulled into a pony tail that fell almost to her waist. Miss Henderson wore little make up and wore thin sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat that only she wore when she was working in her library. The school president didn't notice any way that she wore anything else.</p> <p>"Miss Henderson, Miss Davis, I believe I have some information on how to make my mind up about whether or not to go into your class," she said before giving Miss Henderson a nod. "I'll need to see the teachers' records first, before I know whether or not they'll take up my time or if I need help."</p> <p>The teacher nodded quickly and a few minutes later, she found the teacher's records and was satisfied with a good enough answer in only a few minutes.</p> <p>Miss Henderson went back to her lecture, where she held up her hands and waited for her grade.</p> <p>As Miss Henderson continued on her way ahead of class, her attention was focused on not only the teacher but also the school teacher, Mrs. Henderson. Their eyes met and when Miss Henderson did not see what had been so obvious about the teacher or was it not enough that she was staring at the teacher, Mrs. Henderson looked at Miss Henderson's face and smiled.</p> <p>"You sure don't seem to be a student of the school Miss Henderson," Mrs. Henderson said before closing the door to the teacher's classroom. She left Miss Henderson sitting on the teacher's desk as she walked down the wooden aisle with Miss Henderson trailing behind.</p> <p>The four other teachers took a quick look around.</p> <p>"You know, we've probably not taught many of you today," Mr. Thompson, the school leader said as the five of them walked through the class. He was a big man with a fat belly and a short beard. He was very old with glasses and he stood six feet tall with an oversized hat and a big gut. Mr. Thompson, also a young man was not as tall as the teacher was.</p> <p>"I know I'm just not going to have a good time," Miss Henderson said as was a matter of fact. In addition to being obese, Mrs. Henderson was also rather short.</p> <p>"Oh don't look at me, Miss Henderson," Mrs. Henderson said as she moved between Miss Henderson and Miss Davis. "This is the classroom in front of the class room."</p> <p>Miss Henderson was wearing a black dress. It had a large brimmed hat and she had her hands laced behind her, like Miss Davis. Her lips were very pink and full, and she took the time to look at Miss Davis. As she thought about what Miss Henderson might look like in class, she wondered if her hair was as pretty as Mrs. Henderson. She realized that at eighteen-years of age, she had a lovely face. Though it was mostly her hair that looked good on Miss Davis, she noticed that the black dress accentuated most of it.</p> <p>"This is class, Miss Henderson," Mrs. I believe I know you'll teach it right," Miss. I hope I can learn it right. You do you teacher, we can help," Mrs.</p> <p></p> <p>Miss Henderson nodded to her head high off the teacher was happy to Miss Henderson was one minute Hendersonâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
