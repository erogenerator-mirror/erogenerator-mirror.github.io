In the robin’s nest there were Eggs and the robin’s mate sat upon them keeping them warm</strong>. And in the kitchen in the living room there were Eggs and their little sister on the floor eating eggs, listening to music, and snuggling their little brother. It was that same morning that they woke up in the nude in front of their parents. It was that morning that they realized life can only get better each day.</p> <p>The first time that they felt their parents' presence was right after an incestuous coupling but it left a great sense of love, joy, and respect in their hearts. Now that their relationship had developed to it’s ultimate conclusion it had become one of freedom. They fell in love with a friend of theirs in her garden. The friend was an older neighbor of theirs’s but had been a very lonely young man. Now his father was coming to take care of his aunt.</p> <p>She turned over into the warm embrace and pulled him on top before his erect cock was buried deep inside her. She rubbed him all along her body, the warm glow of his semen flowing out of her body with his warm love making. The hot feeling of his cock deep inside her made her forget all about how long they had been married. They began at her lips, where his sister gave him her first kiss, and continued all the way downward until their hips were touching. The smell of his mother’s perfume was the strongest aroma that he had ever smelled before, even though the smell was still an intoxicating one. His sister knew that she wanted his hot semen in her vagina as long as she could bear it. She had even sucked him while they made love. And she liked the taste of her own juice.</p> <p>He had always told her that her aunt was a little like his father. Not too thin in fact but thin and wispy and sweet. Now her aunt was so much like her that he had no trouble fitting himself completely inside her. They kissed even in their mouths, which made him feel like a child again. And then she rubbed herself up against him in the most wonderful and erotic way. He found that his mother’s scent seemed especially intoxicating tonight. It had a much more exotic tone to it. He found that his aunt was different from his father. She was more like his mother in more ways than one. It was as if all the things that women had said could be their own.</p> <p>He made love to her slowly, as she had done to him. First it had become their habit to go up to her bedroom and sit in silence until the sexual moment of her incestuous passion had passed and they finished their day together. Then they would come up to her at night to lay her on her stomach and continue to make love. To do so they both had brought each other to orgasm before they had done it any other way, although they knew that they had to do it just once or more before they were tired enough that they could resume. When it was finally time it had been time to take her mother into her bedroom, both before and after they had consummated their incestuous lust. The way their parents had treated her made her more than grateful. But it had not quite changed how she lived.</p> <p>She sat on the edge of the bed and spread her legs. He knew how she loved to make love to him and was happy to make the first move. Her lips parted with a sigh and he bent his head between them. His mouth quickly found her vagina and soon there was as much of it as he would ever want.</p> <p>He found that his tongue was the stronger one in fact. It began to work her clit. She was always ready and eager to receive his loving attention. They were in heaven together. The kissing became more passionate. She found it hard to breathe, and then she found herself moaning in pleasure. Her legs pressed against him and her arms tightened around his neck. She began her ascent to the heights of her passion.</p> <p>After he had made love to her it had been time for them to get back to the business of making love. But now their passion had been replaced by need. So they lay naked side by side on the bed. Her legs were still around him. While she held his head there she ran her fingers through his hair. He loved it every part of his anatomy.</p> <p>With her hands she stroked him everywhere. Her fingers played through his locks and down his back. They rolled around him so that they were not in the same position. In fact they were much better at what they did. After she moved down his back she kissed down his entire body slowly.</p> <p>This time it was different for both of them. The next kiss was a lot more powerful than the first. It was the whole of a passionate one, more tenderly and intimate. She held on a man's lips. They made their passion and lovemaking them as their own. Their lips and making them kissing was full of their own.
