When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped</strong> to say</p> <p>"My name is Kutésov."</p> <p>She could have been wearing a pair of sunglasses in the dark. The sunlight that was invading their eyes was bright yellow. His hand reached for her shoulder. Then another hand reaching out to grip hers. That hand was held to her cheek so he could kiss her.</p> <p>She couldn't believe that her body was behaving so aggressively like a man. She couldn't believe she'd taken such a risk to be a virgin and never have her last. She couldn't believe she'd been so eager to please him because she'd failed to make up her mind about her first time.</p> <p>"My name is Kutésov. What was yours?"</p> <p>"I'm Yulia and I'm going home with you to get a divorce and a place to stay. Will you marry me?" Yulia asked.</p> <p>"I am so glad I found you and I can't tell you how happy. I can't think of anything better than what we've been going through. Thank you."</p> <p>Yulia and Kutésov continued to hold hands. During the trip she was on her knees sucking her husband's cock. Yulia had stopped after Yulia had been allowed her orgasm and she watched her husband masturbating his cock. Their eyes were still closed when they got to Kutésov's bedroom and Yulia stood in front of him with his cock in her hand.</p> <p>She could have been doing something else. Her husband was standing near a full sized bed, naked and ready to be fucked. Yulia would be in the bed next to him. Yulia might not even be able to see her husband. She may have seen her husband naked. Yulia might not even be able to hear her. They would probably go to his bed and be kissing, making out, and making love.</p> <p>She loved seeing a naked woman and especially with a beautiful woman. The whole experience was surreal. Yulia could have easily gone down on her knees and started sucking her husband's cock. Yulia may be able to see her naked husband standing in front of her. But it made her feel more alive. It made Yulia feel like more of a woman in love. It could have been anything.</p> <p>She liked this. She liked her husband looking at her while she was naked. She liked being sexually desirable and being fucked.</p> <p>She would like to be naked in front of him.</p> <p>Their lips met and they embraced and their fingers started to rub the others vagina. She was wearing a skimpy bikini and she couldn't wait to have it all. Yulia was very nervous about the day ahead. This was her first time with a man. She never knew anything about being sexually interested in a man. She couldn't do it in front of her husband. Yulia knew her husband would come back.</p> <p>Yulia was a virgin. She had failed in a sexual session. Yulia didn't care if her husband was a guy, a girl, a girl, a geek, and a girl or what she was doing. Yulia didn't care about any of that. Yulia was ready and willing to have sex.</p> <p>Yulia thought of herself as a virgin and a virgin. What was wrong with that? Yulia thought of herself as a woman and a woman who would do anything for her husband. Yulia was eager and willing to give her husband the benefit of her choice. Yulia knew she'd be the first woman to have sex with an erect cock. Yulia could do that. Yulia could just bend over and offer her husband her vagina. Yulia knew she'd probably have the penis of the man she desired in a short time. Yulia didn't care about any of that. Yulia knew she wouldn't care about being the woman she was. If Yulia wasn't satisfied by a cock like her husband was the first time he'd had sex with a woman, she didn't care. If Yulia was satisfied with a man's cock it was okay to have sex with him. Yulia wasn't. As long as she was on the pill she would be a virgin. Yulia wasn't a prostitute. As long as she was safe, her husband would be safe. Yulia didn't care.</p> <p>Yulia didn't know what she was saying. She was hoping her husband would say yes. Yulia knew her husband would be fine. She knew she'd be good with a penis. Yulia didn't care if she was a virgin. Yulia knew Yulia would be a great lover if she had sex with her husband. Yulia was ready and willing to give her husband the best. Yulia had always wanted the best. Yulia and that was best was to be the best was the best.</p> <p></p> <p>After the first chance to date Yulia took Yulia looked they were to a man said yes their hands she'd their vows said thank fuck you.
