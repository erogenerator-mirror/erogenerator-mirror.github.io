The warriors formed a circle around the council fire in front of him. Little Bear had listened to the long debate</strong>, and he had nodded. Well, I would, he thought. Then the council's general spirit was taken and the lights came on.</p> <p>"Do I just get a general good-bye, or is there a special announcement in the way of 'cause?" said Little Bear as the lights went off. Little Bear raised his eyebrows over the roar of the assembled crowd. His lips curled in a smile. "Or..." He stopped and grinned. The lights came up.</p> <p>"Good morning." said Lord Oaken. "You were... very good with that," he said, nodding at the handkerchief.</p> <p>"What?" protested Little Bear. "There's nothing about 'cause I'm not going for my first real meal, and then 'cause I'll be fucking you so hard you won't think you'll be able to survive. Are you happy right now?"</p> <p>Lord Oaken shook his head. "I don't see what you've got in common with Lord Cuthbert," he said.</p> <p>"Oh, we don't have much in common!" sneered Lord Oaken. "Besides, don't you think you better call me Master, or Lady? Well, here then, Little Bear."</p> <p>Lord Oaken took a step forward towards the boy, then turned to his wife and addressed her as he took his place in the circle. "I just hope you can still make my Lord Cuthbert very happy, Little Bear." Then he stepped back to the fire, a grin lighting his face.</p> <p>The light flashed off in one of the dim lanterns. Little Bear sat up as he noticed.</p> <p>"You still haven't heard me... yet, little Bear?" said Mr. Cuthbert with a leer.</p> <p>"Is that what the light means in your mouth-?" asked Lord Cuthbert with a smile.</p> <p>The light flickered on the candle and grew brighter. When he saw that the light had grown so that it seemed to glow in little streaks that seemed to have been coming from a spot in the ceiling and a few feet behind it. Little Bear's head began to turn.</p> <p>"I have been... really good, Little Bear," said Little Bear.</p> <p>"All right, now, dear, since you can still make Lord Cuthbert happy, how 'bout you sit in my lap with that beautiful cock of yours again?" said Mr. Cuthbert.</p> <p>Little Bear was a little surprised at Lord Cuthbert's comment about the light. Did he just make his Lord Cuthbert's wife feel like some kind of celebrity? No, thought Little Bear. Why couldn't he make the Cuthbert-Cord?</p> <p>"Now, dear, I want you to sit there..." said Mr. Cuthbert and, without another word, put his hand in the young man's hair- that Little Bear so enjoyed.</p> <p>Lord Cuthbert and Lady Oaken, as he had done with Lord Brandy, had decided to call off the light. Mr. Cuthbert stood up and turned on the light.</p> <p>"Now, Little Bear," said Lord Cuthbert as he reached forward to fondle Little Bear, "I want you to suck Lord Cuthbert's cock. Now, my little pony, I want you to put out a little bit of light."</p> <p>Lord Cuthbert smiled. "Well, don't you think your little boy is a little bit kinky, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, sir," said Little Bear.</p> <p>"Mmmm, you're a little kinky, aren't you, Little Bear? And this time, it's Lord Cuthbert's time. Who do you think he's going to like first?"</p> <p>Lord Cuthbert smiled. "All right, I thought this would be my day. It was my day, wasn't it? I thought your little boy, Little Bear, was going to love it. But I didn't expect for you to come so quickly," he said.</p> <p>Lord Cuthbert had begun to unbutton Little Boy's uniform shirt when he suddenly stepped back. Lord Cuthbert was surprised, but not for long as, as he unbuttoned the man's tunic, he reached around the boy, unclasped his bra, slipped it off, and stepped back to let the boy's white moprobe hang over him.</p> <p>As Lord Cuthbert stepped forward again towards him, the boy stopped him.</p> <p>"Let's say, Little Bear, you really do have to finish your drink," said Lord Cuthbert.</p> <p>But the boy could not be seen as he was. He had on his knees, hands and knees, face up in the cuffed bow. But the boy was standing on hands, face up. With his head held up! And the other hands behind, mouth upâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
