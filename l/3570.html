"No taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, "why should you think so? He does not</strong> have anything."</p> <p>They both laughed when Marianne suddenly lifted up the hem of her dress with her left hand and pulled her legs apart, her cunt wide open, exposing it to the world. The other students stood their staring intently at it, not moving, until Elinor turned her round and pulled her dress up and off. The other students looked at themselves in a long mirror on the far wall, not wanting to move.</p> <p>"He hasn't seen anything," said Marianne. "What is that?"</p> <p>"It's a tattoo. What is the word?"</p> <p>"What is the word? It's a small, small tattoo."</p> <p>"Do you want to tell me?"</p> <p>With a sly smile, Elinor reached under her skirt and touched it to the inside of Marianne's thighs. Marianne gasped at first, but soon her eyes glazed over.</p> <p>"You will like it," said Elinor. "You'll like it much better."</p> <p>"And the other two?"</p> <p>"Nothing. That's the word. You'll see the other tattoo later."</p> <p>Elinor gently took hold of Marianne's clitoris, which was sticking up from under its hood, and very slowly stroked it, letting her fingers run up and down its length. The other students watched in shock - their eyes, their penises - while they watched Elinor touch their friend's cunt.</p> <p>Slowly and sensuously, the older woman's sex swelled, the lips opening in readiness of intercourse, her clit throbbing.</p> <p>"I never thought of fucking in front of the class," said Marianne. "I thought of taking my husband's virginity, my maidenhead, and fucking all of the boys at school. I've always wanted to be fucked by a virgin again."</p> <p>"That isn't what I meant," said Elinor. "I'm suggesting you fuck a classmate, a girl in her class. You have a class, now, in the student union. You can go on down there, fuck me good. I'll even go down to the university's art library to look at some paintings that I used to love."</p> <p>"That's it? That's all? No."</p> <p>"That might be a bit much. I could show you. You'd like it even more. Would you let me?"</p> <p>"Err...sure," said Marianne, "if that's what you want."</p> <p>"That's what I want. I want you," said Elinor, stroking her clit to a quick stop. "Come to college." The young woman gasped at the suggestion. It felt so good. Her clitoris was hard and throbbing and that little button was about to explode.</p> <p>"I don't want to go to college," said Marianne, taking her hand that had been over her breasts. "I've got a boyfriend. I've already signed my first paper at the university. I don't want it to be the end. I want to be with a boy, in college, in a girl's body. I mean, I know what I want, but I just want to be with you."</p> <p>"You're sure you want to do that with me?"</p> <p>"Absolutely. I just want to know if you want to fuck my boyfriend?"</p> <p>"I think I do," replied the other students.</p> <p>Elinor nodded and lifted Marianne's dress and dropped it on the ground. "I like that dress," she said, "because it's not so tight."</p> <p>Marianne gasped, but her eyes went instantly to her legs and the little tattoo that made them look like wings. "How do you do that?" she asked.</p> <p>"I think it's one of the few sexy things a girl wearing it will have."</p> <p>"I'm not sure," said Marianne, moving the other girl's panties aside before taking hold of her wrist and tugging Marianne to a sitting position. "Come here."</p> <p>Marianne let out an excited gasp as she pushed open Elinor's legs, reaching inside her panties to touch her vagina, her clitoris. Elinor pushed her fingers over Marianne's clitoris and started to stimulate her vagina.</p> <p>Marianne squirmed on her fingers. "Stop just a little bit," said Elinor. "I like the feeling."</p> <p>Marianne smiled. "It's going to feel good. I won't be able to last long, I know."</p> <p>Marianne looked up at Elin and stared down. "My mouth will always want to be yours?"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><|c]o/n/na. : :/ "My lips.
