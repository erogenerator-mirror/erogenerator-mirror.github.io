A Hand at Cards</h4><p><strong>Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her</strong> mind the vast sea that lay beneath the ship.</p> <p>"I'm the love of your life," she said.</p> <p>The captain nodded his head, still feeling no remorse as they approached their destination on board the ship. "You're beautiful, Miss Pross," he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"You're gorgeous," she whispered back, feeling her heart skip a beat as she watched him walk towards her. "My God, I can't wait to see you again."</p> <p>The captain stopped and smiled. "Yes, my love, I plan on meeting you to see your face again tonight."</p> <p>"It's you!" Miss Pross exclaimed. "You're the love of my life!"</p> <p>"And you're my wife!" Miss Pross added in reply.</p> <p>"Yes!" Miss Pross agreed, feeling the excitement in the captain as they neared their destination again. "Please, meet me."</p> <p>"Of course, you are Miss Pross," the captain said and then gave a slow nod.</p> <p>"Come!" Miss Pross rushed with the captain's arm and they ran away, their hands clasped together as they crossed down to a narrow bridge off of town.</p> <p>The ship lurched from the sudden impact, but in the blink of an eye the crew was on the receiving side. A man was on Miss Pross' side, his arm around Miss Pross' waist as they entered the bridge, which had been hastily constructed for them. She turned her head and saw the man standing guard, a man just past her age who was carrying a young girl in his arms. They stood apart and the boy held her closer and kissed her on the lips. Miss pross smiled her approval, a feeling of love rushing through her at the boy's boldness. The boy pressed his lips tight against the girl's mouth, kissing her gently, teasingly, sending her excitement soaring. It was an act of courage. If not for the young woman's inexperience she might have found it all too awkward in the presence of the captain and the young man, but Miss Pross' smile reassured him, as the young man pushed open the girl's buttons and began exploring her body with his tongue, his mouth sucking gently on her lips.</p> <p>"Oh!" Miss Pross smiled as the boy began sucking on the girl's earlobe and gently biting. She moved her fingers on her own stomach and felt the hardness of the boy's cock as the boy slid his hands inside her blouse to caress her breasts through her bra, cupping the soft flesh between hands, pushing her bra upwards, freeing her breasts, which the boy played with and kissed.</p> <p>"Come," Miss Pross whispered. "I promise I'll make you feel so loved. I'll be here waiting. Please come."</p> <p>"Will you make me feel loved?" Miss Pross asked.</p> <p>"Yes," the boy replied, a smile passing over his lips as he felt her nipples tightening in his fingers as he flicked his tongue over her swollen nipple, teasing it between his lips.</p> <p>"Do you know why I don't wear the uniform of the captain right now?" Miss Pross asked.</p> <p>"You don't!" the boy replied and then kissed her again, thrusting his tongue deep into her mouth. Both his hands were busy exploring Miss Pross legs and she felt his fingers pressing against her panties, but not as far as the captain had been.</p> <p>"I just don't like to give anything to the captain if he's the only one under there," Miss Pross giggled.</p> <p>"Well, I'd better teach you then," the captain replied, his tone more matter-of-fact as he slid his hands down to Miss Pross' arse, pushing two long fingers into her tight little hole, causing her to gasp as he did so. Miss pross smiled against him, feeling the warm flesh of his hand slide over her flesh, her flesh responding to the man's touch.</p> <p>"You can get off like this and do whatever you want, but you have to tell me when you want to cum," the girl said.</p> <p>"Whenever I want," Miss Pross agreed, feeling the captain's fingers start to pump into her pussy, making her moan in pleasure as the man did what the girl asked.</p> <p>"I want to feel you with my cock," the girl said, sliding her hands down the captain's waist and reaching around to grip his cock firmly. The captain gasped in shock as her hands grasped the head of his shaft and pumped it firmly, her thumb caressing the head where it shone through.</p> <p>"I want you to feel your pussy with my cock," Miss Pross."</p> <p></p> <p>"No one little Miss Pross co</p> <p>"</p> <p>"please let me make me do it like it I want it " yes itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
