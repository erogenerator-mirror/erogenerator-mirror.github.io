And therefore a</strong> law can be found to be, not just good, but extremely good," said the Reverend.</p> <p>"That is how the Law work, Mr. Flemming," he continued; "and if in the right spirit, you would allow the law to become something new to you. Perhaps you should consult the Law for several times a year. If not, you may, in the course of your life be in danger of having something other than the Law of the Land you are determinedly interested in."</p> <p>"Mr. Flemming, I am not sure I understand."</p> <p>"I think it is best to have all of this explained to you. However, since you have come here, you see it is only good news to know that the law has become something of a burden to you.

I could be here."</p> <p>"I already have, but I can't come here and write what ever it is that I say, and if you will permit it, I will allow it. It is what I feel," he said. "But you have to do something."</p> <p>I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I did what could be done.
