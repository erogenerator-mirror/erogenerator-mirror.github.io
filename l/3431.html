Henry VII., King of England, articled with Don Philip,</strong> the Irish Emperor. He was on the road at a time when I was working at the London office. It was my first experience with another man. I had never done anything remotely like it.”</p> <p>“So what do you believe?”</p> <p>“I've never fucked a cock before. This will be my first time.”</p> <p>My cock jerked in my pants. I wanted to get up but I felt frozen in place. He had his cock in his hand. It was a beautiful sight. I could imagine it as if from the moment I laid eyes on it a hundred times. I am not gay, but I had always been interested in cocks. Henry had a cock, but I have not. And a beautiful one. He was hard already. I had to adjust my own cock to be able to feel his. He took it in his hand and showed me how to stroke it.</p> <p>“It's not that you don’t trust it, it only makes you more horny.”</p> <p>“I’ve never been that horny.”</p> <p>“You’ve never been stroking a cock in your hand, but you have once. And you never liked looking at it. It makes you feel self-conscious. Do you think you could be gay?”</p> <p>“I have never been with a guy before.”</p> <p>“You’ve never even kissed a guy.”</p> <p>“I’ve never kissed a dude.”</p> <p>“I’m a natural, I don’t care what you like.”</p> <p>“You should know. I’ve never tasted anything so delicious.”</p> <p>He moved his hand higher. My head was spinning. I could hardly stand this excitement.</p> <p>“Do you want to feel my cock?”</p> <p>I thought, “I’ve never even kissed a guy.” He wanted to know.</p> <p>I took him in my hand and leaned over. His cock was soft as he put his hand on it. I looked up at his face. I wanted to kiss him before this ever happened, I really did.</p> <p>I leaned in to kiss his lips. I felt his body heat through my blouse. My lips touched his and then he held my lips with his. His cock rubbed up and down my leg as it was pressed against my leg. I could feel my pussy throbbing and wet. I was so glad that the meeting was over now.</p> <p>We stood there kissing for a long time. My cock was hard as a rock now, he could feel it poking him. The kissing was wonderful. I thought my cock was about to explode through my pants, but he broke the kiss and started undoing my blouse. I was wearing a sexy bra that really showed off my big breasts. My tits looked big and I don’t care if you think the bra is sexy or not. We stood there for a long time, kissing, feeling each others bodies, enjoying the situation. I felt warm and very sexy and happy.</p> <p>His kisses increased. When he finally got my bra off I felt the weight lift off my breasts. My nipples were erect and throbbing. His lips found my nipple as his hand had a finger in it. I didn’t know what to do, or say. Everything just seemed to happen in the next second. I was feeling his hands caress my breasts and my heart was beating so fast. I could feel myself getting warm and wet from a strong desire for him. My hand went straight down to my groin. I ran it through the front of my pants and was thinking only that this was so wrong. I felt a tingle coming over me and I was shaking and moaning. It felt so good I had to get up and leave. My breasts heaved and pulsated. I was feeling weak. I pulled Henry’s hand out and I reached down to pull his cock but he stopped me.</p> <p>“No, not yet, please wait, we’ll do this later,” I could hear him saying. I was getting scared if I left now. I wanted to tell him I felt bad, but I didn’t want him to leave me.</p> <p>“Henry, its alright,” I said meekly to him. I pulled his hand away from my crotch. I wanted his cock in my hand and he knew it too. I slid to the floor and held the back of his head. I leaned against him and kissed him again, our tongues were long, slow and soft. He kissed my nipples rubbed his cock slowly but firmly. When I could feel it was fully hard as if my hips began shaking and he couldn’t take him so much longer.
