English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER III</h4><p><strong>He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious. He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes</strong> he could go without sex for a week. It was not the kind of year to be celibate. But sometimes the sex turned him on. Sometimes he got into an episode long before any of the main characters. He was a boy in the 1970's. Some kind of guy, he thought. He got into a gang bang film, a porn flick, a porn shop, a bondage club. He was in an out of the blue hotel room all night, fucking and sucking girls all around the hotel. Most of his friends were married and he had no one, which he took in stride. He even had his car out front by the window, cruising up and down, getting more and more horny, his cock hard as iron, with little blue balls hanging down. He liked the sex. He didn't. Not one iota. It had to be because he was in love with something else altogether. And he was definitely in love with a girl.</p> <p>One day he woke up from a dream he was having about a girl he had just met. She was gorgeous, dressed in a black corset-style dress, red boots and high heels, and her long auburn hair flowed down over her back in strands that reached for the back of her neck. Her lips looked painted on the face of a girl she had just met. They smelt like real people, not what he and his friends used to wear to make the day seem like forever. He kissed his cheeks and ran his hands through her long red hair, but even it was slightly parted, and in the middle of it. It looked like a girl's hair in a bunch. It was a pretty ponytail. Her eyes were green, but the colour of emeralds. And he looked at her with both admiration and reverence; he felt like a goddess of love, and she looked perfect for him. He took her face in his hands and kissed her. It was a kiss that had seemed so long ago. He was a man of love, not just of sex.</p> <p>Her arms went round his neck and her mouth sucked his bottom lip between her teeth. He felt like he could go on forever. His hands were caressing her waist and waist, and her skin felt soft and warm under his finger tips as they ran up her body. She moaned a little as he pulled her towards him and kissed her neck once more, teasing her a little. Then she let him go and ran her hand down onto his cock through his trousers.</p> <p>She slid her hand up his shaft, and gently squeezed it gently. He was thick as a cucumber, and it slid smoothly along her hand in a smooth, tight fit. She had never felt him like this. He was a man of pleasure, and he was hers. She loved it, too. She stroked his length. She stroked him and caressed him, strobed his cock. His whole body felt like it was glowing. There was little else, just sensation; there was just the feel of pleasure. His hand slid down her stomach and touched the top of her pussy, where it stopped. It was warm and wet. He moved his hand to feel there, and felt his fingers slide along, then into her. She was wet. There was only heat. He slid another finger into her, exploring her vagina, as she stroked his cock. His hand moved to her arse, sliding his fingers around its cheeks so that his finger stroked over her anus. His cock was hard, and it was throbbing.</p> <p>He slipped his fingers out of her, and put them on her lips. She kissed his fingers, then licked his palm, which gave her a taste of her own sex. She was hot and dripping and ready for him now. He moved his head down, kissing her arse as he did. He kissed her vagina, then his hand slid down to her cunt and felt her wetness. He pulled her to him. She opened herself and felt his rigid cock sliding up and down her thigh and across her cunt. She moaned when she felt his head at the opening of her, then he was inside her, pushing to her and then sinking in. He went slow. She loved it. She loved him so much, and was ready to feel his cock grow in her until he took all and started to thrust gently inside her: inside her. He slid down onto her, slowly, and she felt the warmth of his body on the thin walls of her cunt as she pushed herself onto him. She felt as though he was inside her all the time, feeling her body go hot and wet inside his shaft as he kissed her. She felt his lips on her lips and tongue, his tongue, and nose and tongue, feeling as though, as she kissed. And suddenly as they were part of the lips, part of her body, joined and part of the lips, merged together, joined, joined in a tongue part of lips of body.
