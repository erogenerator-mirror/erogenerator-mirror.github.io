Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXV In Undying Loneliness</h4><p><strong>Ere the dawn, guided by those old embalmers and bearing with me the dead Kallikrates, I departed from that hateful Kôr. As I think, none saw me go, for, forgetful</strong> to the gods of the ancient world, I had not gone much longer than those who would have known me to see me.</p> <p>For I was alone, not even with the Gods of the Earth. Aye, I was alone, so did I have the right to have the honor and pleasure of having my body fucked. I thought, it was just a matter of time, and there was no man of ancient age to satisfy me like that. Still, being alone, I saw no need to fear the mortals with my flesh on the earth. To them, I was as they saw only a whore—a well-formed cunny, a wanton, lustful fuckhole in search of her own lust. Besides, my life just seemed such that I did not want, no, need to have sex with that, just to make ends meet in this town of the dead. I could just get a couple of quick sessions of love.</p> <p>A few minutes later a group of people came out in the direction of the marketplace, so I walked over to them and asked them to buy me another item of clothing. Then with trembling hands, I made a new choice, "I have always wanted a woman of the earth with this fine skin."</p> <p>The pair that purchased the garments looked at my new appearance, and with a nod, "You'll enjoy this." Their hands went directly to their dicks under the table, and I was soon naked. For a second, they sat on the side of the table, each other, and then I was the center of the crowd, their hands sliding up and down their erect shafts in quick, efficient movements. It was quite exciting to watch.</p> <p>A little later, I saw a group of men arrive in the courtyard, dressed in western robes, standing around the fountain of the sun. Their hands were already busy, stroking their cocks, the men in the robes caressing each other, while one man with his erect member pointed his in the general direction of me. He leaned over toward me and they kissed, whispering, "My God, don't go. Stay with us." My naked skin was being caressed, the smell of sex, the feel of hands on flesh from head to foot, along with the taste of sweat, and I felt I was going to get fucked. I wondered whether the people would come back to the house for sex if they saw me like this, but instead their hands moved down my body, and I saw their long fingers dip into my cleft.</p> <p>I moaned aloud, "Ooooh," under my breath. They must know what my answer was, too. The men took one step closer to where I was, I could feel the erect penises rubbing together, and soon I was rubbing my hand up and down them, feeling their wetness. All of a sudden I was taken back by their presence in the courtyard. As my heart was pounding with excitement and nervousness, I was afraid that they might be jealous or, maybe, even possessive. My fears were of course unfounded, for I did not know a man that loved women, even though many did now.</p> <p>"Please leave these alone. You're going to love me."</p> <p>The men left, and I felt their nakedness, the hard cocks and the smells of male sweat, the wetness of cunnilingus. Then another young and quite attractive, black man appeared, and I was almost in fear as he was so much taller. He was wearing a loose fitting shirt, and I could see his chest muscles were taut. He was also as naked as me, but, for lack of better words, I was soon to see his large and stiff phallus.</p> <p>"Please, do what you think is necessary, but please do it first, before those cunnies are soiled. I'm sure your husband will see no reason not to. Come with us."</p> <p>He led me to the fountain of the sun, and I wondered how we could do it without attracting attention, but we passed easily by them, and, suddenly, I was naked with a large cock in my hand. The young man took his penis in his hands and started pumping it in front of me. The youth was very large, and as we passed him, his cock was soon spurting a lot of semen. I stroked and kissed my cock while he was pumping. I could smell our sex on his hands as my hand caressed his cock. A moment later the youth had pumped his cock up the side of mine a couple of more times, and the first ejaculation was very satisfying.</p> <p>The youth led me up the stairs to the first floor of the city, and where we entered a room with walls thin walls. In which were like the city. It had a single door, which was wide, and, and only a mirror to keep the men.
