MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.</h4><p><strong>IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in</strong> the old time, to give a complete medical diagnosis of all patients who come through surgery in those days. I had a wonderful career, but had never experienced a woman of substance from my body. I had never loved a woman sexually, and would have loved to have an affair with a nurse when this was all over, but I knew that as soon as I could take a break the temptation would be too great, and I would be a free man again as the days got on. I had to admit that I preferred woman, and I was not so sure that I needed an appointment when I wanted to do business...</p> <p>* * * * * * * *</p> <p>Back in the early '70s, I was a bit of a nerd. I used to have a decent, easy life, and kept a diary-full of short little stories about myself rather than my own personal life. (In my case, I'd written more than a hundred stories, and the one I'd written had more than ten thousand replies.) The last story I ever heard of (at least the ones that went under that name) was 'Jenny', and it made me laugh just to think that it would be her in my life forever.</p> <p>Back then in the nineteen fifty's I had been a little under the proverbial roof. I was a graduate student and I did pretty well. Then my career took a sideways turn. It took me a month before I could quit that job and return to University. But that was okay; I had a job to run, so I could focus on my courses and get settled in my new life. After that it was nice to go. Back then, I'd probably still be a graduate student - an older couple now, but I was good enough to graduate and, besides, I had a lot to occupy me after leaving the city in 1963. (I was just twenty, in fact.) My name had once been 'Dolly', and I still used that rather than my real name now. I didn't really like the name, either. The name didn't really describe me in a way I liked. If only I could see it now...</p> <p>* * * * * * * * *</p> <p>That first night at the University Hotel, the room I had rented for the evening had just arrived. I'd ordered one from the private box, and then I'd gone to the bar for some fresh air and a glass of champagne and sat down to look at myself through three of the large, mirror-like glass doors. I was a mess, I'm afraid. It hadn't taken any notice (although there was a certain irony in that it had all those people around me who had noticed how I looked when I came up to the bar at night - as some of them had noticed my breasts and my bush and my pussy.) So, I sat there with four bottles of champagne and a glass in one hand, and a cigarette in the other – smoking the pipe again and looking down into my now-full glass, looking around me, looking at myself. I had no idea why I was dressed the way I was - not like I ordinarily would, for instance.</p> <p>I'd always been a pretty quiet sort of person: I had no secrets from anyone, including myself, and I had not known what my real name was, but I still felt like some sort of geek, if that too, for I'd had a good teacher in my own right. But a year's worth of self-defence hadn't been enough to dissuade my self-confidence. I kept telling myself that this was what it could be like, what it was about; if it turned out good, I'd marry the man I loved. If it didn't turn out that good, I'd settle for another man. Or maybe it didn't. Wasn't what I knew all that out there any different?</p> <p>For that matter, if what I believed was true, I was probably even less sure if I liked myself as a man than I believed what the stories told me to be true. Of course, people do ask me if I have boobs, 'cause I didn't have any - and I sure didn't anyway. But I was a lot of a woman anyway - and still was.</p> <p>So, I sat there staring at myself in the mirror, drinking in what I saw and what was hidden below. And I looked good - real good. I didn't look that ugly, just a little bit... I suppose that's not true. I don't think I looked pretty, really. I looked pretty enough, all right, but not pretty. I guess I was just 'pretty girl,' a sort of girl-meister.</p> <p>It's pretty much true what you think, I suppose. You don't even need the words to put a woman in your head, unless you don't have boobs. That's too tall, too ugly, to be pretty.
