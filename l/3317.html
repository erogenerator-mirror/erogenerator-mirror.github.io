English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LVII. The Convalescent.</h4><p><strong>We meet with several puzzles here. Zarathustra calls himself the advocate of the circle (the Eternal Recurrence of all things), and he calls this doctrine his abysmal thought. In the</strong> end, I'll tell you a secret; in my opinion, there's nothing I wouldn't do to solve a problem, and anything that helps with that will help with me.</p> <p>Chapter 1: The Circle of The Dark</p> <p>A day after the death of our last friend, I had a dream in which I woke on my left side to the sight of a girl lying on top of me. She was naked and sleeping like a baby; her skin was glowing a golden color in the moonlight and glinting on her body in an almost hypnotic way. We were together, but we couldn't be on the same planet, or in the same place at the same time. She was in a dream, and she called me. I didn't wake, so I just felt her presence.</p> <p>I was completely alone in my dream. I was standing in the dark. I heard voices and could only hear the distant sounds of people walking around. I was on her bed, she on the ground, and I was in her mouth. At first, I just pretended I was asleep again. I felt her lips caress my cock and start to make me harder. When she started to move on her own, I felt my body responding, responding back. I started to slowly fuck her mouth with my dick while it hardened, and she did the same to me. Then, the next thing I knew I was sliding into her pussy, and she was moving on top of me. She was fucking me up and down while kissing me, while grinding on my dick, with her thighs on mine. I reached my hands under her and was grabbing her ass in my hands, feeling her legs, her thighs, and every so often she would push herself down onto me and I would be inside her again. She began to move faster on me, with her pussy hitting me hard on each pass and her breasts bouncing on me.</p> <p>I just lay there, while she was kissing me and riding me. It felt so good to finally have her in my arms again, so I tried to make love in front of someone but she wouldn't give a fuck. She took every opportunity to kiss me and lick my lips, while I was inside her, moving faster than she did. I tried to lift her up slightly so I could come inside her. When it came, every muscle in me seemed to be straining against her, and we fucked in the moonlight for another couple hundred miles or more before she rolled off me and went to sleep.</p> <p>That night, I was dreaming that I was inside her again, but when I woke up it was late morning. I felt myself lying on my left side facing the light that was shining through the window, staring up at a dark haired, curvaceous goddess in front of me. I was on my back but was underneath her, and I was moving my dick with her movements while she was on a back leg. Every time she moved, I moaned, as if she was trying to be quiet, and every time I moved my dick I imagined that I was fucking someone else, and we both were. Every time she was on her knees, and I got up on my hands and knees and entered her from behind and started to fuck her hard.</p> <p>Even though I was feeling good from the pleasure and the dream, it was strange when I heard someone else's voice in the darkness next to me. I never thought anyone would talk in the darkness, but it was her again. I heard, and I just had to look around, until I saw my boyfriend standing there, watching us. It was him, standing in front of my boyfriend, and watching me fuck a woman. It was a big scene to watch. He was looking at me intently. I had a feeling about him.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt my cock being pulled out of her wet pussy and my boyfriend started fucking her without caring about whether it felt good or not. He just kept pumping his cock inside her, even though I felt it was hurting her. In the moment, I couldn't take it anymore and I started to ejaculate inside her pussy. She didn't notice that I had cumming, but I did when our bodies shuddered together, and she hugged me in her warm body.</p> <p>When we were done, we lay panting on each other as we had sex in the morning. I heard nothing; it could have been someone walking by during the night. Then she finally got up and was moving towards the light. It was dark. But in the light she still looked beautiful and sexy as hell. She looked at me with lust in her eyes, and started towards the light with all the confidence of the young girl that she could be any time. When she got to the light, she was in between my knees, she was touching the bed was a little bit longer between her legs. She had my thighs and the tip to my dick. She didn't to her thighs.
