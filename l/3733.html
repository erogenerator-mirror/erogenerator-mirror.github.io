GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER’S BUSINESS</h4><p><strong>Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker’s shop, set the lamp down on a workman’s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which</strong> had been building all week long. Then he turned to himself and gave a sigh of relief.</p> <p>In a way, it felt almost like he was looking for a reason to go home.</p> <p>"It is definitely a beautiful evening," Oliver reflected with satisfaction, as he looked out the window through a cloud of mist.</p> <p>No, Oliver decided right off.</p> <p>Maybe today wasn't the most beautiful night of his entire life.</p> <p>A moment later, Oliver returned to himself.</p> <p>"Just so you know," Oliver said in response to a voice from behind him. It was a feminine voice, and it definitely belonged to Oliver. "I actually didn't go looking for a new dress to wear that night. I think I was looking for something a little more appropriate and sexy." Oliver looked around nervously before turning back into the shadows.</p> <p>"I know," Oliver said before turning back to face the woman. "It's just that I don't know if this will be my night or if I'll find myself in her place."</p> <p>Oliver started to apologize again, but the woman's lips suddenly were on his, and her tongue dangled in his mouth. Oliver quickly pulled back, but not before she gave a teasing grin up to his face.</p> <p>"You should leave," Oliver said in an exhausted voice.</p> <p>The woman turned to him with a smile that was all too familiar. Oliver was the man who had been looking for himself for a long time, and he knew how it was hard to find the perfect, sweet man when his eyes weren't focused on the window in front of him.</p> <p>When his hands fell to her smooth waist, however, she pressed them into the small distance between between them and continued talking.</p> <p>"What can I wear for a date tonight?" she asked, her lips just barely brushing the side of his face. Oliver smiled, which only added to her beautiful smile.</p> <p>His hands slowly began to move up over her arms to find more of the perfect woman standing in front of him, and he started to think about his life in general, and his hopes for his future.</p> <p>Oliver suddenly felt like such an idiot.</p> <p>"Are you sure," Oliver suddenly asked, still taking note of everything about the woman in front of him. "You're such a beautiful woman."</p> <p>The woman's smile disappeared and quickly turned into a smirk.</p> <p>"I'm sure," the woman said. "Now get back inside. I'd love to have dinner with you tonight."</p> <p>They had an excellent dinner together, Oliver and Oliver's second date. The other three were only together until the weekend, but that date was one of Oliver's best experiences. In fact, it was the first time Oliver had ever been with another woman, and the date was the first time he had been with any other woman either. However, Oliver didn't let the relationship end, and he was just as happy when they finally got back to their hotel room afterward.</p> <p>When they finally did go to bed, Oliver was too tired to even remember how they ended up fucking. He was tired and not particularly tired for a long term relationship. However, after having sex for twenty minutes, Oliver felt just as tired as he had been when his world collapsed down around him.</p> <p>Eventually, Oliver got his hands and feet tired, and by then he felt like he was walking down the mountain to fall asleep.</p> <p>But his whole body felt tired, and Oliver felt like he was about to fall.</p> <p>Finally, Oliver gave up, and the girl gave him one last sweet kiss.</p> <p>"It's no use going," Oliver whispered to himself, and left the bathroom, heading in a drunken daze towards his room.</p> <p>Ol Oliver's heart was still pounding as he walked up the hall towards his bedroom, and he wasn't even fully awake when the door opened.</p> <p>"Oh my god, is that... Is that you?"</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay?" Oliver asked, giving a nervous laugh. "I feel like I would burst when I see you." Oliver quickly closed his eyes, before closing it again, and turned on his side.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" Oliver asked, pulling himself up to a standing position. He quickly turned around, and then pressed his face against the wall. "What's wrong all of a sudden?" he asked again. When he felt Oliver's fingertips caressing his face, he pulled him in for an emotional embrace.</p> <p>"It's... its okay, Oliver." Oliver," Oliver whispered Oliver, "It's not so fucking you," the whole world, it's fine tonight, you're so good." "It's fucking you," Ol Oliver," Oliver," Oliver repeated the voice, Oliver in response—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
