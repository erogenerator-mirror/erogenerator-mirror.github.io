It was time to be fucked, however, and I had the feeling that I had the desire. I reached out my hand for her. "Hmmm?" was all that was said after a while.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. You" was all that she said for a full minute. Her tongue darted about in my mouth as I tasted the sweetness of her cunt. I loved her scent! Her soft skin felt good against my fingers, and it was so sexy I felt myself getting more urgent. I grabbed her tightly in a tight embrace and I felt her nails scratch my arms.</p> <p>I lifted up gently, looking deep into those sexy eyes. "You are such a sexy woman, Mary. Now, do it for me. Do it for me right now... just do it for me...."</p> <p>I reached up and took her hand, and we moved into the shower. I led her back to the bed. I layed down with her, kissing her tenderly, feeling the passion of her lips. I could feel the softness of her skin and her lovely breasts against me.</p> <p>I reached out and began caressing her. I caressed and caressed her beautiful ass as we lay down together on the soft bed. Her tits were so nice to caress as they hung down to the pillow, and it felt so nice to hold them. I couldn't believe I was touching her but I felt something more - like a weight lifted from my chest. I felt her lips kissing me as she leaned forward to kiss me again and again. Her breasts were soft and beautiful, and her nipples were rock hard. If it wasn't so hot, I think I would have been hard. I started to kiss downwards, but she pulled back and looked me in the eyes. "Wait."</p> <p>I hesitated for a moment, then I felt my heart race. She had sensed my hesitation.</p> <p>"It's OK," she said. "You can play with me." So I let her know, and she reached out and grabbed the bed sheet at the foot of the bed. She got up on her knees and sat on the bed, between my legs. She rubbed her hands up and down my thighs, making me shudder with delight. She took her fingers into her mouth and sucked on them gently. "I'm going to want you to cum for me. I just really do want you to cum in my mouth. Do it, stud." She laved my cock from bottom to top in her mouth, and with her tongue I could feel the pre cum as she licked gently around my head.</p> <p>Then she pulled back again and looked me in the eyes. "Make love to me like you mean it - with your whole body! Do it! Make me feel good!" She pulled back a little and sat up, looking me straight in the eye. I looked down and I saw the lust in her eyes, and for a moment I felt embarrassed. I wondered if I really wanted to make love to her. That was the problem. There I was. In bed with this beautiful young woman. My sister. For the moment it was too awkward. But she seemed to think that she could feel good too. "I'm sorry, honey," she said. "I'm really, really, really sorry for saying that. Don't be. Really, I mean it. Make love to me, like I want you to do." So I took her hand and stood up. I felt her body move with me, so I put my arms around her to hold her body against my own. I reached down and began to caress her pussy. There was a soft sound coming from her throat as she let me rub her pussy with my hand. "Mmm. You're already so wet, sweetie. You're still so wet for me. I need you... I need you so bad. Please... " I let my mouth drop down to her breast as I caressed her. "You really are a dirty girl, Mary. I can't believe you just asked me if I wanted you to cum over and over, you nasty little slut! But of course, you're all mine. I can't help myself. I need you, too." I reached down between us and felt her lovely pussy. I could feel the wetness and heat on my hand as I ran my fingers over her moist opening. I ran my fingers up and down her pussy, but didn't touch her clitoris. I looked around the bathroom, trying to see what was going on inside. So far, nothing else happened as we were getting ready and I was just waiting for things to change. Mary to cum for me. After all night, however, something happened.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>to be specific. I felt like this feeling more strongly and more and more.
