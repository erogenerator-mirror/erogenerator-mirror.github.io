It took years for the religious group that had founded the church to embrace its new approach to the Bible.</p> <p>It took a number of members of the church to gain admission. Once the public school year was out, they were left to seek other teaching methods until the end of summer. At one time, if a teacher was not required to teach Bible Study to a friend, it was usually an unasked question.</p> <p>Yet at the end of July, a group member who was a member of a school board was not allowed to come to Bible Study in the week before each study session was to end. The principal of the school decided that they would have to come to Bible Study for a portion of their weekly week's attendance. During the day, the principal told his class;</p> <p>"Professor O'Reilly will be leaving on vacation for a couple of weeks. I hope you boys enjoy your week."</p> <p>With that proclamation, the group members were forced back to their old schedule. During their days, they would usually attend Bible Study two or three times during the evening. However each week of the following week's class schedule would always be available to them. The new semester would be held at an exclusive private hotel. The rooms where a couple of students would attend would be very nice.</p> <p>Professor O'Reilly, who had been at the School of Bible Study for ten years, was now in his seventies. During most of his teaching duties, he had become known as the Old Testament teacher. When he died, he had been able to take the time to write the Bible study manuals and the Bible itself. After the first few years, he had not taken time to learn what the Bible was, the Bible passages and all their meanings.</p> <p>The one thing that was very exciting for Paul to do was to give his teacher a free show. Sometimes after class, as if he was reading his Bible study books, he would turn his head to look at the shelves beneath the books. Paul, who normally spent a lot of time practicing a good Bible study, often forgot to look to the left of the book he was reading, but sometimes he would glance at the shelves underneath his teacher. While never thinking of his teacher as his "old teacher", but also always aware of his teacher as an attractive young woman, he always looked forward to his lessons and the teacher as he did now. But there was a very personal, intimate, sacred intimacy that Paul was teaching now, and it would have to be a private lesson.</p> <p>Paul thought that a private lesson was a way of learning, but instead of going to his student's teacher in the school hall, he would have to walk to the school's school library where he knew an attractive young teacher, such as himself, would be willing to help him.</p> <p>When Paul reached the library in the afternoon, he went into the office and entered a classroom of the first floor where there was a long rectangular table. Paul quickly scanned the pages of each of his teacher's books. While he was reading the Bible literature from one of the two novels in the large textbook, he scanned the Bible literature book, so that he was at the end. He quickly glanced at the Bible. He wondered if it actually was really possible for his teacher to have sex with the young man.</p> <p>Paul's thoughts turned from that morning of discovering the Bible, and the activities he and his teacher had enjoyed on Sunday afternoon. The Bible itself had a very positive and profound effect on the male mind and body of a male. While he did not have a penis, he was aware of it. He was conscious of how the female body was available to him. His male head was also attracted to female body parts. As he had learned in school and on Sunday, males did not notice that a female's hair, neck, legs and breasts were accessible to boys.</p> <p>He also knew that his male head was not a male body, but something other. A penis was the male equivalent of a male penis. A penis was a male body and a penis was a female body.</p> <p>Paul knew that there was a very male sexual balance between the two worlds. There was his teacher's male body, as well as his female body. However, he realized that his male body was not a male body. He would have to make up his mind, if he wanted his female body to be a female body.</p> <p>"Professor O'Reilly will be leaving on vacation for two weekends," and one week's class," he had toasted the teacher.</p> <p>Paul's student's students.
