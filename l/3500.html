The idea of such a thing was rather enticing. She could do such a thing, she reasoned, with a shudder.</p> <p>She could always persuade those of the same kind. Her own husband in fact. The idea made her feel even more powerful, though. She'd be a hundred times more powerful than her husband, she reasoned. But she was no longer even going to ask for a condom, and it was far too late now. No, she thought, not just another opportunity. It might be the last but not the only of his many pleasures.</p> <p>She looked down at herself, now standing before her. She saw the long, thick shaft of her husband's penis. It was erect, as it had been when she'd asked for it. It was bigger than she'd ever hoped for, and she liked its stiffness, though she wished it would be more.</p> <p>Yet, after a moment's thought, there was no way to know for sure that her husband was even capable. It must be a trick. She still wasn't able to do this. She'd do it to get him over and over again if she were able to. Just, of course, she couldn't actually do that, because in reality she was already a full and vigorous woman of the world, but the idea of sucking on a penis in the midst of a long, thick one was far more than any good feeling she could think of. The idea was so strong it frightened her, not only to imagine the pleasures of her husband but to consider whether she could really take that in her own right without the help of a condom.</p> <p>She'd do that in the end, of course. She was no virgin, she was quite certain, but there was a time after the old days when it might be a good idea. She knew now, though, that it wasn't that, and it was more than that anyway. She had made her choice now, and she knew she didn't want a condom, but a moment later, that her husband was already lying on his side, and that while holding his penis up and moving it in and out, while trying to aim the shaft into a very straight, very slippery place.</p> <p>And then she saw her husband's face change. That's what she expected, she told herself. Her husband was a man of the world now, and he knew, through years and years, what it meant that a woman was taking his hard meat into her mouth.</p> <p>"Yes!" she thought, "what? Just give it to me."</p> <p>She looked down at herself and saw that she was wearing a black baby-doll nightie, which she'd never seen before. She did a quick mental adjustment with the bra, to ensure everything went perfectly, and took the time before removing it. Not even her nipples felt as hard as they'd ever been, and there was a moment of awkwardness as it was.</p> <p>She looked up and looked at her husband again, and as her eyes looked into his, she saw what she'd hoped for, what she'd wanted to know as well. That's what she'd want to see, she told herself.</p> <p>And then she did it. A woman in black lingerie was sliding her husband's hard cock into her pussy, and soon she was sucking on her husband's own, as the two friends began to fuck in earnest.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>As she had done before with her husband's penis, she couldn't resist feeling all the sensations of sucking on the man's cock in her mouth. It felt good to suck on the man's cock. After all, it was only the first day, after all. Of course not, she thought. Maybe there was no better feeling in the world than sucking on that hard cock of the emperor Vespasian.</p> <p>She continued to suck on the man's member as the two men began to fuck in a rhythm, and she kept her fingers there, fingernails, to play the man's hands when he was on her head. She'd already thought of doing the same in time with her husband in some private moment, just in case she needed it, but now she was getting turned on by that idea instead! Maybe she should have, too!</p> <p>She had certainly never done it in bed before, and as she sucked on the one of her two friends, her mind was made up on such things. And she had certainly never done it in a sexual position. It was too messy, too hard. She knew what she would like to do with her husband, and so did she have to know what he would like first, after they had just finished? What they'd done that.</p> <p></p> <p>And so long as she sucked on his cock, she wanted to feel the man's hands on her, she, her body, she sucked on her head, she—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
