As</h4><p><strong>thou dost purpose to live, when thou hast retired thyself to some such place, where neither roarer nor harlot is: so mayest thou here. And if they will not suffer</strong> thee from tha abominable infractions, they would suffer thou dost mind, where thou shalt fear from thee.</p> <p>"But not my master." She said, raising herself onto her arms and facing me, her legs spread invitingly. "Now, I'll teach thee the joys of being fucked by me."</p> <p>I was at first disappointed, feeling the pain of my testes emptying themselves into the mattress, but seeing as I had only cum less than half an hour earlier, I quickly made up with the pleasure I had already derived from having been fucked the night before. A look of pure joy spread across her face, and at last she was ready to be fucked. Before she had fully become fully into the pleasure she deserved, she climbed atop me, presenting herself to my shaft. I grasped her hips and pushed inside her, feeling her warm cunt walls wrap tightly around my shaft with a sense of relief. She was so wet and so tight that I could barely fit inside her. She paused only for a moment, then began to move up and down while pushing me back against the mattress. She lifted herself up, impaling herself on my length before slowly lowering herself, engulfing her Master in the process.</p> <p>"Nnaa!" She screamed as her head hit the mattress, and she fell forward onto me, kissing me softly and crying out in pain as my shaft penetrated into her. The pain from her pussy had caused her breasts to begin swelling, and her nipples were swelling larger. As I had expected, her nipples were very large, with the tips almost pointing at my chest. I continued to thrust up into her, my hips hitting into her ass each time she rose up. She was riding me like there was no tomorrow, and I was afraid to climax yet before we would start. I could tell she felt sorry for her Master because she was beginning to tire, and the fear she had caused me would not change that.</p> <p>The fear of my coming climax, mixed with fear at my sudden absence, made it impossible for her to maintain the motion she was using on me. She felt my penis swell and start to swell inside her pussy, and she slowed as she felt my excitement begin to increase. She began riding me harder, her eyes wide with fear. The expression on her face only made me want to pound her harder, but I had to let her hold back, or I was going to get thrown from her. I pulled her on to my cock harder, driving it as deep as it would go inside her, and I began to come.</p> <p>I filled her belly, and she felt it flow out of her. She screamed as my penis burst into her, causing her insides to convulse and spasm like a snake. She felt me throb as I spurted my seed into her, and she felt my cock swell and spurt with each explosion she'd made inside of her. As my passion subsided, and she slowly climbed off of me and collapsed on the bed next to me, lying there like that only momentarily.</p> <p>"Nnaaaah!" She moaned as she felt me gently kissing her face and neck, then kissing her mouth. "That was wonderful."</p> <p>"I wish you'd do that for me every day." I murmured.</p> <p>"Mmm, I like that idea."</p> <p>We rested for nearly a half hour, kissing and caressing each other lovingly until we became exhausted.</p> <p>"Hear of this, Master?"</p> <p>"I would hope so." I smiled.</p> <p>"May thee die before thou hast reached thou end, at last, of the passion thou have left within thy belly."</p> <p>"I suppose you'd rather be dead than die before thee can reach thee end."</p> <p>She laughed. "Then it should not be thy end that shall be the end—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
