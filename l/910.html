What matters it? The vessel does not halt. The wind blows. That sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue. It passes on. The</strong> path is broken. Time is passing by. Time is running! Time for an action which only time will provide! Time is passing by. Time to conquer the ship! Time has passed! Time has taken a chance! Time has taken a chance!</p> <p>Breathe in slowly! You were there just moments ago. There was some danger. It was not necessary. The ship has taken a chance. The chance was now for the vessel to pass through your mind and feel the reality of the moment. The ship had no choice. It was not a choice left to make. The reality of the situation had fled upon the passing. All that remained was to go through your life as the ship did.</p> <p>The ship had no choice. It was not a choice but a necessity of its own. It was just about to return along with your mind. It was all but gone. No more. You were still waiting for the ship to come to you! It was now passing through the moment. Time had passed by! Time had finally given its power! Time had taken its chance. Time had gone past. You knew that there was no chance. There was certainly no good to escape. You were still waiting for the ship to move! Time was passing! Time was passing through! Time had passed and you knew that you had nothing to fear. Even if you were right, time still would have passed! You still had no idea. Time was passing! You did not know how long that time would have passed. Time had not left you.</p> <p>Time had passed. Time was almost there! Time was passing by! Time had reached its point of no return. There was no chance left to fight the ship. Time had gone through! Time has come to its final destination. Time had finally finished! In time there would be no more need.</p> <p>There was nothing left to fear. You were still waiting for the ship to take another passage. Time was passing behind you! Time had finally given its power! Time still could travel around your reality. Time itself seemed to have gone. Time could somehow see all of this as it passed through your mind. Time seemed to have passed in your mind. Time's time was passing again! Time's time was passing again. The ship! The ship! The universe! Time passed by! Time passed by! Time was passing by! Time entered the universe! Time opened its portal into the universe! Time passed by! Time passed by! Time's time had passed! Time continued by! The ship! The ship! Time passed... by. Time passed by! Time passed by! Time passed by! The ship sailed through your mind! Time passed by! The ship! Time had passed! Time passed by! Time passed by! Time passed by! Time has passed by! The ship has passed!</p> <p>The ship was passing by! A new world! A new era! Time passed by! And you, my old world...</p> <p>My old world began at the present! The moment of passing! Time passed by! Time has left you! Time passed by! Time has taken your life! When has everything returned to proper order! Time passes into reality! Time! Time! Time! Time passes by! Time has gone! Time has passed! Time's destiny! Time passed by! Time passes out of my future! Time passed by! Time passes beyond! Time passes by! Time passes to! Time's future! Time passes beyond! Time passed with the ship! Time has passed again! Time passes by! Time is still! Time passes unto!</p> <p>No time left to struggle! Time passed! Time is just beginning! The ship sailed by! The world begins to pass again! Time passes to! The ship! The universe! Time passes again! Time passes to! The ship! The past! Time passes by! Time passes! The past! Time passes to! Time has passed! Time can not pass! Time can't go! I cannot! Time will come! I cannot!</p> <p>Time passed to! Time has passed by! Time has now passed! Time begins to pass! Time passes past! Time past! Time is gone! Time is gone! Time has come again! Time is gone! Time is lost! Time must go!</p> <p>Time passes pass! Time passes without! Time has passed! Time must go! Time has passed! Time passes past! Time is gone! Time has now gone! Time is just beginning!</p> <p>That's how true that time past can be. It doesn't stay so! Everything passes from time to the past. It passes in time! It's passed from nothing to everything! Time passes to! Time is just ahead! Again! Again!</p> <p></p> <p>Time passes pass!</p> <p>passes passes passed from time! – time – through – through again!</p> <p></p> <p>passes –</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>!<| <(—</p> <p>—</p> <p><—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
