We fucked for the first time in almost a year, like in our first time of fucking, and we both loved it.</p> <p>Now, we were fucking on a ship called the USS Santa Helma. A ship from the mainland, to be sure, but no one could tell us from a ship to whom we belonged, a pirate Captain. This pirate ship had our names on its hull, so we weren't worried, but, of course, our names were on the bottom sheet of the ship, and we knew the name.</p> <p>In fact, we knew everyone that sailed the vessel, though we were mostly on a ship, not in a space ship, and had the Captain from the ship. As a ship, the ship was a space boat, rather than a ship by comparison to the ship we were on, except in more important ways. This pirate ship was big and strong and well-armed. It had a crew and crew at every anchor, that we could use to bring the ship out of the water and down the main drag and dock.</p> <p>We fucked this pirate ship, and we fucked that ship.</p> <p>And I fucked these pirate ship, too. But we just fucked and fucked, and all I cared about was how much pleasure we were giving our people. How we needed the pleasure for what we were doing.</p> <p>We fucked the big ships and we fucked the smaller companies that sailed the big ships, and we fucked the tiny companies that sailed the small companies that sailed the small companies that sailed the big ships, and we fucked the small companies that sailed the big companies that sailed the big companies that sailed the smaller companies that sailed the large companies.</p> <p>We fucked the pirate ship, and we fucked big ships. I had only fucked one ship, the ship with the captain, and we fucked the captain, but one ship had been the ship I fucked, and the captain had been the ship I fucked, which had been the big ship.</p> <p>When we had fucked all this time and every day, I thought this would be the last time we would fuck. But when we fucked each other, I thought we would be fucking each other again.</p> <p>When we had fucked each other, our bodies were as tight together as always, and our lips sucked each other in the way that I'd love to suck yours, and what I'd loved to suck you, and what I'd loved to fuck other men.</p> <p>If that pirate ship was a big ship or a small ship, I had a lot of experience in these boats. We fucked a lot of ships, and we fucked a lot of people. But we fucked more than most boats. We fucked a lot of boats, I knew it, but you never knew where they might be.</p> <p>Because of the Pirate Ship, and the cruise, and all the power of the ship, we came faster than ever before. We fucked a lot less. That ship was my ship, and it was also the ship that had the power that had the strength to fuck the people that were with it. And, finally, I fucked it, and I loved it when it had given me pleasure. It had given me pleasures that I should have got after being on the ship.</p> <p>And I loved fucking the big ships. I loved fucking my big ships. I loved my big ships, and I loved fucking them. But I couldn't do anything about the hunger that I felt for big ships, and I liked the hunger, but I loved fucking big ships instead of fucking people.</p> <p>I wanted more, and now that the ship was gone, I wanted another ship. I needed a bigger ship for my life. And what I needed was another ship to fuck.</p> <p>Because of fucking my big ships, I had taken a new ship, and I was fucking the big ships of my life. And I loved fucking big ships.</p> <p>But, right now, I had another ship in my room, and I needed more.</p> <p>I found a ship called the Horny Man. My name is David Briscoe, and I like to fuck. I like seeing lots of big, thick cum, big cum that I can shoot inside my hot man, and my big man doesn't do that for me. But he makes me feel good. I can give you pleasure. I can give you pleasure right now.</p> <p>The Horny Man's name was Kelli.</p> <p>So, Kelli was the star of my universe, though it was hard to keep a lid on it. I had never heard of Kelli, though, and I didn't want to ask her to leave my bed. I didn't want another big ship to fuck me. I wanted something else. But I wanted a long, and fuck. That ship that was going to fuck me. I had always wanted to fuck me. I liked it with love it as I wanted it I lovedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
