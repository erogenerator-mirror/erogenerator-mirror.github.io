True misery he had but just</strong> a temporary thing until it became something more.</p> <p>So he had just been fucked by a whore for twenty minutes. It was not even a whore, so Marius knew he would not find another one. This thought angered him. He was too tired to find it in himself, however. He should not have been so aroused by his whore. He had no desire to do so. He should deny the shame it brings to him, his father's whore, for five years of living a lie. That's the way life should be. He should not be a slut. Marius lay back, his head on the bed's comforter, his eyes closed. He knew that he would not sleep. He could no more go to sleep than to dream like that. All the misery he had lived, all the shame he had caused, was to have come to him. Now he would go to sleep. He had no choice. How could he do so? He closed his eyes again. It was like that time of the gods; the old days, his world had changed around him, the old gods.</p> <p>And then he was gone. The world was different now. The old gods had changed, his world and his people. He was new. He was the new version of his father's whore. He was a new version of himself. He was the new version of his father's slave. He was the new version of himself. He was nothing else. He was different.</p> <p>Marius woke with a start, suddenly aware that a shadow was hovering over him. His eyes slowly fluttered open. He sat up slowly, trying to think. Then the shadow slid down over him, enveloping him in darkness. He was naked. He was not wearing clothes.</p> <p>"Marius," said a voice. "You are in darkness. You can't go near me. You have not made love in so long, but now as you lie there you are a lover, the lover of the whore, the slave of the sex-crazed whore."</p> <p>Marius sat straight up, and his eyes adjusted to the darkness. There could not be anyone looking in his face, no one. Had he not been naked before, he would have not seen the shadow's face. Instead he saw a dark figure with long black hair, long dark hair that floated past his shoulders. Dark eyes were fixed on his cock. He stroked the shaft eagerly and leaned forward to feed it to one of his eager lips.</p> <p>Marius' cock felt wonderful. He licked the tip of his cock clean of cum. He had been saving his cum up for months without having to taste it. He licked his balls again, gently, sucking each of them in turn. He moaned in pleasure and let drops of hot cum fall on his tongue.</p> <p>"Your cock is beautiful," said the woman, and Marius felt his tongue sliding down her throat. She sucked his cock for a few moments before pulling back.</p> <p>Marius sat up slowly. "You are the new version of yourself, and your cock is beautiful too. I have not made love to a whore in more than 25 years. I have sucked and fucked you several times, but no whore has just fucked me. I have only made love to you, Marius. Only you and your cock."</p> <p>Marius sat there, feeling the woman's words. A lover, a whore she had told him, she had said. A piece of white flesh between his legs! And the memory of what she had just said made Marius want to be closer to her. That thought made him want to fuck her again, but this time he would need to do what the woman had said. He had to tell her so many things, so many promises; he needed to tell her, not this time, that he was a whore, that he had no more than the last cock he had sucked for days! He needed to beg her to let him make love with her; to let him suck her cock, to let him make love with her cock!</p> <p>He took her in his arms. He needed to tell her what to do. He needed to tell her that he was a whore, that he had been in bed for thirty minutes with a man, and that he did love making love with men, especially men who were sluts--how could he be in that situation?</p> <p>Marius pressed his lips up against the woman's. He kissed the whore's breasts, one after the other. The women in Marius' life had often been his most favorite parts of their bodies: his mouth, his hands, the way that they could feel a man's cock--his cock, his cock, the way that they could be felt a man's cock move inside them, the way that they be fucked. The female had been the sex-making-cocks that they were for hours before the sexual.
