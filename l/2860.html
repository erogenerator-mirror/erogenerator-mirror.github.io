May she be chosen to make her own decisions for, and she may have the opportunity to make her choices." The book is opened by three men, the first, the oldest, the last. All agree that, when young women marry, she may never be able to decide for herself how to decide to be a husband or a wife."</p> <p>The man in the middle leans over the back of his fellow man, looks into the book's eyes, and replies, "As I said, dear, it is a book of all things." The other man offers his glass of whiskey, "So, let's watch a movie."</p> <p>The professor, already in his late teens, knows the plot well, if you can call it this. It's just one of those movies, where a woman is on her knees, sucking cock and getting fucked and the man stands in back of his wife as she sucks his cock. He looks down at her, looks at her tits as she gives the other man the best blowjob of his life. As she is sucking this cock, at the same time, her mouth is filled with his cum. "Ah yes..." she says to the other man. "That's it, darling. Just like your teacher taught you, just like he taught you."</p> <p>His cock is hard at her words. As she continues her blowjob on her second man, the professor, looking at his wife, sees himself coming up from under her, takes a drink of whiskey, puts his glass on the desk, and brings it to a stop next to the front of his desk, where some glasses are sitting. As he puts his glass down, he looks down at her and says, "Ah now... there we are." He puts his glass on the table and goes back to watching the movie. Professor Jones, already in his late teens, has lost his glasses in favor of a movie, and now the camera is focused on the woman as she sucks this guy's cock. Then the man on the screen steps up to the bed, pulls up his pants, turns and leaves the room.</p> <p>"That was a hot video!" he says to himself, "and one that deserves much more than just this." He watches his own cock as it starts to become hard. So hard that, right there on the bed, his wife is sucking her husband's cock and he is also fucking her, but this time they both enjoy a long slow fuck...</p> <p>"Oh yes..." she hisses at the other man, "let's watch the movie. Let's watch one of your favorite movies." She moves her mouth off of his cock and begins to crawl off of the bed, taking her skirt and panties with her. She stands on the way towards the door. "Let's watch a movie. My bedroom has no furniture to take the back of the couch. Come on. Let's watch that movie." She takes his arm, reaches down, grabs his cock, and walks him down the hall to her bedroom.</p> <p>As they enter her room, she turns to face the camera. "Just come on!" she hisses at another man. She takes his cock and leads him by the cock back to the couch. This will be a special sex movie. Just like the movie. He looks at his wife as she takes his cock into her mouth, opens her mouth as wide as she can, leans forward, and takes the tip of it into her tongue. Her finger plays with her clit as she sucks him off.</p> <p>"Ah yes..." she hisses, "oh yes...". She pulls back from the camera a little, looks her in the eyes, smiles, and leans forward again, engulfing cock. "Ah yes..." he moans. So hard, so wonderful. "Ahem... well..." she lowers her lips so that only the tip of his cock is in her mouth. "Oh yes... there... there..." She kisses his cock again, and again, and again. She reaches behind his ass, rubs his ass cheeks and continues to suck and ride his cock. Professor Jones has just pulled his belt off and is unbuckling his pants. "Ah yes...," she says, "you're not wearing a condom, are you? It feels lovely, sweetly. Feel what it's like to have a guy inside a woman without getting knocked up." She looks up at him to see him standing there. His pants and underwear are off. The room is cool against one another man's naked body. He takes off. As she pulls his pants and underwear, the camera is taking his pants down. He stands naked. She lays down, and she begins to the woman is nudeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
