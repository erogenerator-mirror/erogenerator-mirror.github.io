It's called fucking!' and they walked hand in hand down the street to his car.</p> <p>He was so comfortable with her with their naked flesh on public display; they would have never been seen in a crowd of teenagers; or outside a restaurant but as they were alone, with the traffic and other traffic between them they were not so inconsiderate.</p> <p>The two lovers were naked and pressed together in the back seat, side by side, when Mr. Collins had his cock sucked by Elizabeth's best friend.</p> <p>It would be so exciting to be surrounded by others; to walk behind them; to catch any attention that they may have, to be the first to take a cock into their mouth or vagina; to see the other girls masturbate. It would never be as erotic as it would be to hold his dick and do a cock sucking.</p> <p>The first few strokes were very arousing and felt so good; to kiss it as best as possible, to rub, to lick it as it was in your mouth.</p> <p>They enjoyed each other's mouth and the mutual sucking; when it was over they would walk back into the car and start kissing again.</p> <p>They could be standing next to the front of the vehicle. They could get away from any nosy neighbours who might be looking. When they were in the car they were not in the car together but in their private world. They would look into each other's eyes and kiss; they would kiss deeply.</p> <p>For Elizabeth, the kiss was very sensuous, erotic and satisfying. She enjoyed kissing with Mr. Collins.</p> <p>She would enjoy feeling his body pressed against hers against the car and feel his cock at the cleft of her vulva; she liked the feel of his hardening cock sliding across her lower stomach; as he rubbed against it, as he rubbed his erection against her pubic hair.</p> <p>They would kiss with the feel of his cock pressed against hers, against her lower abdomen; against her vagina which she loved and which she always wanted him inside; and he caress her upper abdomen which she loved and which also he loved.</p> <p>When they came it seemed like it might take an extraordinary effort of will to continue kissing so they would be in a place where someone might easily see them. Elizabeth would try to keep the car on the coast for their trip to the airport. And she would hope that someone would happen to park the car next to hers and she and Mr. Collins would not have to stop the car.</p> <p>They would kiss; they would kiss and fondle each other, they would French kiss, they would kiss more; and they would kiss as well.</p> <p>Mr. Collins would press his erection against her vagina. As he slid his erection through his pubic hair she would squeeze her legs together.</p> <p>She would feel his hard on.</p> <p>She would love feeling it pressing against her vulva.</p> <p>They would continue kissing to their mutual pleasure</p> <p>As they kissed he would caress her buttocks and stroke the top of her vulva. He would sometimes lift his hand to her buttocks, squeeze them firmly, and rub them together. With his other hand, he would rub her ass; squeeze her buttocks. He would caress her buttocks and stroke her anus.</p> <p>Their mutual masturbation would also be quite pleasurable, as both needed to rub their clitorises, at the same time. Sometimes, when it was hard and painful, they would rub each other in a 69 position which would help both get off. She loved him fucking her; he loved her being fucked; he loved her tasting him...</p> <p>He loved her, he loved her sucking him and using him as a masturbation device. And he loved her fucking him; and sucking him. Neither knew how the other would enjoy the act. It might be something that they'd make up: fucking, cunnilingus, both the act of sucking and fondling.</p> <p>As he had suggested, they had only just agreed that we would continue kissing. We could kiss in the car, to the airport, and to the airport until we were safely returning home. But we could never be as close as we were.</p> <p>Neither had seen the other's breasts but were fascinated by what was to come.</p> <p>In their fantasy's they could both be naked. Both could see each other's breasts; both could feel them as they were in full contact with their bodies.</p> <p>They would stand or lie apart from each other, facing each other. They could be touching, touching in the same way.</p> <p>'Let's have lunch,' Mr. 'While we are in each other places. And we can do our kissing while we are in each other places'. In each others 'I should stay.' and we 'I might go there' together.
