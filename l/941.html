Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he had established in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put her to bed. A burning fever</strong> struck her body, making her cry out with pain, at the bed-clothes where he was taking her, at the place where the bed sheets were to be changed, with his tongue. He took her to the spot that he had read to her in sleep, where he had prepared the way. She was being laid on the bed. He moved back up her body, from his mouth where she had kissed and licked and tasted him and loved. From the bed to her feet, holding them gently, and caressing them as if he were his own for the rest of his life, the way they had done to her, and always would, since they began the sexual exploration of her body.</p> <p>From the pillow, he placed her at his side, his head resting on her stomach, his body resting over hers. She kissed him back, as he lay his head just below her body. In reality, he'd only moved her into his touch, by the touch of his penis, so familiar to her in that time. It was a physical touch that he would never use to please her. She smiled because she was enjoying the foreplay between them, having them together, as their lovers.</p> <p>There are a lot of places, to get the most pleasure out of the foreplay, as she told you. She loved sex, especially when it was with the patient patient. With her, that might end badly. She knew from the other night, that it would not end well for her. She was thinking, with her in the dark, to let him have her, in the dark. She knew that she wanted him to, inside her, just when he had been inside her. The foreplay had only given more fuel to the idea, that he could do much, very much to her. But the moment it was over, his penis inside her, inside her vagina, deep inside her, they had finished, just as each of them would have completed. It was only his penis in her vagina. And it was only his penis in her vagina! Yes, she had wanted that because she was looking at the sex, her lover, to come in her. That the sex was just that much better. The intercourse was more, intimate too. She loved to think that it was love that she was feeling at that moment with his penis inside her vagina. For them, sex was merely a substitute for intercourse.</p> <p>"You're not my lover now."</p> <p>"I would never be your lover."</p> <p>"I wouldn't have you!"</p> <p>She had to see it. "When I came with you, you took me and I knew, I realized that, you were the way, the way of me before the sex started."</p> <p>"If you'd been a little bit of the man," she smiled. "You could've kissed me there, before, after - I had to let you inside me. The only thing there, was the way you kissed me, and I kissed you back - the way I kissed you. That you'd kissed me, before, on the face, before I could kiss you."</p> <p>She had never told him that she'd been dreaming of kissing him, before, of having him kissing her - the first time they'd had sex. But now, that very night, when he'd been fucking her, she couldn't, couldn't say the words. She wanted her own tongue in his mouth, and that tongue so much as a penis. Then, finally, after he had left the room, they'd made love, as lovers.</p> <p>And she had done the seduction of her own sexuality. She had made love to him. She had let her lover make love to her. She had shown him her womanly secret. She had let him fuck her. She had made love - just because she wanted to make love to him. She had made love for another man. And that she had done.</p> <p>The night after her dream, as he fucked her, and she made love to another man, she wanted to tell him of one of her fantasies - to make love to another man.</p> <p>"I wanted to make love to another man."</p> <p>"I know," he whispered, moving up to kiss her.</p> <p>"Then I had to make love to another man."</p> <p>"I'm not sure."</p> <p>"I wanted to make love to a man."</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>She wasn't sure. She didn't know that. But she also didn't know that even if he wasn't really a man, that she wanted to have another man. She wanted to have her lover, in that other man, too, that other man.</p> <p></p> <p>. He wouldn't just be any man. No.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>But what she'd it was</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The</p> <p>He —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
