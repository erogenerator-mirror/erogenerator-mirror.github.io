After they started the bidding and losing, the winners decided who’d get the best card in their hand. This would be a game with an interesting twist. They could all win their favorite card, but they also had to make sure to get the best card. If they lost, it could also mean that a card might be used as a bargaining chip, because some card might also go out the door for them and they couldn’t go on with it.</p> <p>Any of you have any ideas?
