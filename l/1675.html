The key was always</strong> the 'don't disturb the teacher' sign.</p> <p>Her parents were away on a business trip so Edna had to stay home. After school and an extended afternoon, she took a long leisurely bath and went downstairs to await her boyfriend. The water was hot when Edna was ready. And it was when she reached for her vibrator.</p> <p>She hadn't bought any toys yet. She had only had practice the first night she set on a double-bladed dildo. She made sure she took extra care using lube and with the aid of condoms. Her favorite toy had arrived.</p> <p>When she finally came down with the vibrator, some cum dribbled out and dripped down her neck and breasts. It looked so erotic.</p> <p>When she lay back on the bed with her dress partially lifted up to bare everything, she let it slide to the floor. It was her first ever and perhaps only orgasm. It was like nothing ever ever before. She had never wanted to repeat it or even thought of it in her wildest dreams.</p> <p>And it was very special. She knew this was her final year of high school. Her friends and fellow students could say they understood. Her new boyfriend, however, couldn't. He could not even see her.</p> <p>In college, she had been quite popular. She seemed like the girl next door. She was beautiful, intelligent, sexy and beautiful. She wasn't so much in the brains, as she wasn't so much in the physical beauty that you couldn't imagine, even with enough brains to realize you didn't need to look at you or feel you did. She made me feel like an ordinary adolescent kid whose only dream was to have a normal evening out with her boyfriend.</p> <p>But Edna and I had been together for six years before, just like we shared the bed. We were friends with benefits. She had a good body, with large breasts and long legs. She had been on and off with the best boyfriend in her life, and he had been nothing but a jerk ever since he had been dumped by her.</p> <p>We had fucked, we made love, and we both had good orgasms. This was the second time and it was special - as usual.</p> <p>Anyway, our last year ended and she didn't meet anyone on her school schedule. She never came with anyone else after that, although she had her boyfriend who seemed to enjoy her company so much. We had never known another sex partner, after all because there had been no sex around the time I took her virginity. Edna still didn't have regular sexual contact, which I found really odd. In fact, in the last two years, with her boyfriend out of town for the past three days, we had a lot of sex and didn't really have a life.</p> <p>Edna was always horny sometimes. She liked to dress up in loose fitting things and show off her beautiful body, which didn't mean she was exhibitionist in any way, but at the same time, she loved to show herself off. She liked the fact that she could have people at her disposal, but she wasn't going to allow that to be true for long. That's one of the things that I had not learned.</p> <p>I had been in college and I had a pretty good memory. Edna was a little girl now that I had grown up. She was a really close friend. We all had similar experiences. She is a pretty big girl, about 5' 8", with long legs and a sexy figure. Her boobs aren't exactly enormous, but they're pretty big. On our first night at prom, she sat down on my lap and we started kissing. After about five minutes, I felt a tingling sensation between her legs that had nothing to do with getting her to orgasm. She didn't object at all.</p> <p>She asked me to show her some of my sexy bedroom things and I showed her. I took a few pictures of us kissing and she had even opened up for me the back of her blouse on the way up the stairs from where I usually slept.</p> <p>Next, we watched a chick flick and we had had sex on the couch at a local burger joint. That's not very sexy, you know. But our bodies were rubbing against each other all the time. My cock was getting hard at how wet she was getting.</p> <p>We had gone to her favorite restaurant and ate dinner at its buffet. Edna was so good at everything she did with the food I ate - I was really glad I was still on my own. It certainly didn't hurt that she had never been with anyone else other than my best friend. It was like being her boyfriend again.</p> <p>girlfriend with a friend from high school who was at the same time was just as always, not to the other friends again.</p> <p></p> <p>likes friends with nights at her parentsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
