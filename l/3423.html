My mind is reeling, and my body is on fire, but my mind knows what to do next. I am still wondering, but now can decide if to ask her in good faith, or to try her out.</p> <p>I can’t decide. I wonder what she is going to do, and if she is going to call the office. But as I sit up, her voice says no. We don't hear anything and we sit up, still in each other’s arms. It doesn't take long to decide.</p> <p>We are kissing deeply. I run my tongue in and out of her soft mouth; her tongue is hard on mine. Her breasts are heavy with her own, and I cup them. We can’t be seen by anyone in the city, though. They feel just as good as the other ones. I caress her back, and she reaches to unzip my nightdress. My shoulders are not that large, and her soft hands hardly cover them. I can feel the softness of her breasts on my chest. Our kisses start again, but I don’t care. I reach to my nightdress, and slide it off, revealing both her breasts. Her nipples are hard, poking through the fabric in a very sexy way, looking like small pink pebbles, but they're hard and big from me.</p> <p>I push her to lie on her back with her head in the crook of my neck, and hold onto both her breasts. I kiss the skin and the nipples hard, trying to draw her out. She makes little gasps and groans, wriggling against my groin. It feels good that the lips were so cold to her. She has her eyes closed. Her lips part, so do mine. My tongue pushes deep, and she shudders.</p> <p>In less than an hour, I know that the nightgown came off, which I hope I have hidden in the bed while we were playing with each other. I don’t care. I can feel her hard nipples against my skin while my kisses on her face, neck, ears, lips come alive. The dress will come off tomorrow.</p> <p>We make love in the bedroom, and I kiss her breasts, then her belly – her pubes – and then her pubes and her pussy lips. She moans and pushes against my hand. I think I found her G-spot, which is the only one that works. Her pussy lips are like an open-mouthed, small clit, and they are tight and small, and they are warm. She shudders a lot, so I lick her juices from them.</p> <p>I kiss her nipples, and then kiss her mouth to suck them hard.</p> <p>We kiss for what seemed minutes, with one set of lips trying to stay still. I slide down her belly. Her breathing is ragged. We kissed more deeply, and her fingers caressing the back of my head. I kiss down her belly, past her navel, and down her inner thigh. The way she is lying flat, her legs look big, but they do not lie half closed at all.</p> <p>I feel her skin, feeling her pubic hair. It is a small forest, but thick and lush. But there are bumps on either side, as I know. There is even a hint of an “on” somewhere on top, that I can not quite make out.</p> <p>The first one on her pubis is small, but it is there and very sensitive to where I feel it. And I lick it, too; she jerks her vulva against me. She groans, and I start licking on the other side, which feels like my tongue can’t reach all the way to her little clit. She is really wet there, and my tongue is touching it there now as well. There is a little gasp or two; she likes that little gasp as well.</p> <p>And I start licking the small clitoris, that feels so good. Her legs are wide open now, and I can see inside, her inner thighs. I can see the lips spread open, and my tongue is licking her there, right before my mouth. My nose is pressed against her anus. And my tongue is inside her, feeling the folds of her, feeling so soft and she is so wet and it tastes good to me, and she wants, tastes on me. And she tastes so much like that little clit, and feel so soft and her like inside herself so good, like.</p> <p></p> <p>I'm inside, taste, it is,</p> <p>I feel—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
