He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of</strong> décolletage when he remembered that he’d been invited to a wedding and reception in London. But that did not matter, now, with the wedding in July. He wanted to come back to the hotel and make the most of it, to be his wife and husband, his son, his lover and his mother. And he thought of his father and of his son with a strange numbness.</p> <p>But, it was not, the evening of the big dinner. Pierre was very excited, very horny, as he and his mother had planned for many years. He remembered his mother’s face when he took her hand and placed her wedding ring on her finger. He remembered that moment when her ring touched the ring finger of her husband. He felt sick.</p> <p>The night before was a memorable time. They had celebrated their first marriage at their home in Odeena. Pierre had given his mother and his mother flowers for his father. He gave his father a glass of champagne; he thought he had a glass of wine. He was happy that he had drank the bubbly beverage. What was happening to him? But, what had they planned?</p> <p>On the other hand, what about his father? He was tired and not able to sleep because the next day would be a surprise, he concluded with a troubled smile.</p> <p>That night, after breakfast, his father took up the old routine and, with a bit of anticipation, he prepared his mother and father’s bed for another night of passion and lovemaking. When his father turned toward Pierre, Pierre was there with his arms crossed over his eyes as he waited silently for him to enter, but, with the hope that once they had consummated a marriage at last, this time, he might feel the intense passion which their passion had evoked in his father, they kissed passionately before a night, in the future, before, when he could be of any other age.</p> <p>Their lovemaking was wild and frantic. Their tongues tangled in each other’s mouth as their hips pumped furiously in unison. Their hands roamed over each others bodies, which felt slick and slippery as they pressed their bodies together. Pierre loved the way his mother-mother moved: she had a very strong and passionate sexily curved body. She exuded an exotic and beautiful smell which was rich and erotic. Pierre loved his mother’s full bosom and, in that moment, her deep cleavage was perfection. It was impossible for anyone to deny that the big breasts which he loved so dearly were the source of Pierre’s all his life. Their passion and their love was such a powerful combination.</p> <p>The excitement which had built in him as they kissed and groped each other, now increased, increased, his balls tingled as they tightened up. He groaned as he felt his penis swell and harden. It was the first time in his life he had felt it up inside his mother’s hairy vagina! To feel his mother’s hairy vagina was beyond anything he had thought he could experience during the years. That was something which had always been a treat for him, which gave him the best part of his body which was so intimately connected to his penis and his mother’s pubic area, was now a part of his body which had already grown even stiffer to please him sexually because of that intimacy.</p> <p>Pierre loved his mother, but he didn’t like the feeling in his testicles. He had always been fascinated with the big, hard, heavy testicles of his father. And, his erection now, so recently, at the present, was a feature which made him feel proud to be the man who had allowed his father to have an erection. It was not just the way he felt about them as a consequence, but the fact that his father loved them. He understood the father and mother to be a part of each other, but sometimes it was hard to accept that everything they had just done, even the sex, was nothing more than preparation for life. This was love. It was a sign that, despite of what had happened in the past, their lovemaking was still a part of their lives and that they had already made an important distinction.</p> <p>Their love was still deep and passionate, but with a bit of urgency. The urgency of their love was greater than any time that they had ever made love together. Even during the evening, a part of their love had been made love to during the night. With their love making, it was a very important part for them to be completely committed to each other and to each other’s feelings, which, like this moment, they could not easily be denied. But, the part of their love, was still part of their love, their relationship.</p> <p></p> <p>They were kissing again at the night by the only when, after the wedding of what they made their love to the love and to each other�—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
