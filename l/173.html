Biographical.</h4><p><strong>Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and South. It is not down in any map; true places never are. When a new-hatched savage</strong> discovers a land for lovemaking, love comes. And it is that's all I was going to do.</p> <p>I'd been watching my first porn movies ever. I liked the ones where a woman was the star. There was a sexy babe getting the fucking of a lifetime, but even the best porn films were boring to watch. I was only curious to see what other genres of sex could be. I loved to see a woman with great breasts - smallish ones - with large nipples that made a man cum with a little effort on his part. I had always been fascinated by the feel of a man's cock inside a woman's snatch - a man's cock pressing against her cervix - because the pussy is just so damn good and it makes me feel like a woman.</p> <p>So when I found a place to rent my favorite sex porn, I picked the place. It's a big place packed with people on all varieties of sex - big cocks, small dildos, butts - with the kind that get you fired in a business deal. There wasn't a good place to rent a porn magazine - except for for those who enjoy their porn - without their company knowing I was in the wrong room. Even my porno-loving girlfriend didn't like to come here. I found an empty couch in an otherwise empty house, the couch's armchair was over the armchair's back, and there was nothing but a dark area between the sofa and the chair's back; nothing else in the house other than a dark space between its back and the edge of its cushion.</p> <p>I was looking at some good porn when I heard the noise of voices. I heard men come up the stairs to my empty apartment, talk about their dates, and then leave. Some of the people were pretty young. Some were decent looking with large, beautiful cocks, some were achingly ugly and some were a little weird. There were a lot of these, really. I watched some of these women, too. I liked to try them out. I also watched a lot of women in porn. It was something I never thought could happen. My experience watching porn was always the same. I never knew when a guy would cum over and I didn't have the chance to watch that. I had found places to rent my porn magazines and my imagination was always running wild. It was the only way I could do it.</p> <p>I was looking at a porn magazine when I heard footsteps. I'm kind of good looking, but with my average height and build, I was an outsider. I was a young woman and an outsider. There's a reason people are so easy to look at. It's easy to look around while watching porn. When women are attractive enough to be a porn star, they're naturally easy to look at. I thought I was an outsider. But I could do that.</p> <p>"Hey, I'm in luck," the voice I heard as I looked up from my magazine was my neighbor's, who was younger than I am. He was handsome and always smiling. "Want a beer?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," I replied, hoping to get out of the way so he could talk to me. I liked him; I liked his smile. I liked being his neighbor - and now he had talked to me. I liked that.</p> <p>"We can't stand by id."</p> <p>I knew what he meant. I nodded and took the beer I was holding out. I'd been watching porn, and the one to my right was a good one. "But I like the ones that are into it."</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure you do."</p> <p>He stood there in the doorway talking with a girl sitting on his couch. He was just talking to someone. They looked exactly the same; one girl was on her knees with his cock in her mouth. She looked a little rough, but there was no mistaking where this was going. I was standing a foot away and I looked right at her, who sat there with a guy's cock in her mouth, sucking on it like a lollipop.</p> <p>I was transfixed watching so much porn, so many of the actors and actresses looking like whores. There was plenty of pussy for the guys to suck off and swallow.</p> <p>"Come over here," The voice said quietly. I heard a little voice beside me, but felt a weight, a little weight being taken of it, in my mind. It was a weight that I had already carried on my own - and I had been carrying it on my own ever since I was a student. I heard a little voice, too. It was just too much of an authority to control - it, it seemed. I wondered what else I was just too much of a powerful person. "Yeah? How would I be? I, uh? She? You would I know, you? If I don, you? Come on?" The voice, Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
