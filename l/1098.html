His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his heart had, so to speak,</strong> been pounding in her soul. With his cock buried deep in the beautiful brunette, Marius had been hard the whole time, with it's beautiful brown skin and her tight pussy, he had known it. He had been hard for her since he had first met her, he could not understand why she hadn't tried to seduce before. She had never made it obvious that she was interested. The only thing he knew for sure was that she had never been interested in him!</p> <p>'Hey Marius', she asked, looking at him over her shoulder. 'You sure that doesn't get you off watching me?" She smiled, as she got up on her knees. Her pussy was still soaking wet, glistening with saliva. She had a hand behind her, as it rubbed the side of her breast, while she smiled at him.</p> <p>"I'm just too shy," Marius sighed.</p> <p>"Oh, come on, Marius," she said, turning her back to him as she raised her body toward him. "I feel so bad, you know! I wish that I were this much like you... I wish that I could make you happy... and if I could just... just... just get over here and make you cum all over my face... I'd show you how I do it." Then she bent over, sticking a leg over his body as she slid her body down to her feet on the blanket, then moved her body back up on, pushing his cock back inside her. She had the top of her body completely engulfed by his, while her breasts were pressed against his chest. Without skipping a beat, Marius thrust his cock into her, as he held her in place with his hands wrapped around her waist, then pumped his cock in and out of her.</p> <p>His cock felt so hard, so deep, and so much better than Marius' cock could ever be when it was fully erect. It seemed like her breasts were more sensitive, and her body had more of a toned and plumpness to it. Marius was so surprised by her body that he still felt a bit insecure that this girl actually liked him, even considered him to be in charge while fucking her. And as she thrust her body back and forth on top of him in perfect synchronopation with his body, that was exactly how she loved being fucked! He felt as if he was sliding in and out of her, with her body fucking him, with her face and her breasts pressed against his chest. She was doing this because she wanted to keep him in her forever. He could sense her desire in him.</p> <p>Marius' own body was becoming more and more excited. He could feel her pussy contracting over his cock, as it began to rhythmically squeeze and unspream his cock. Marius, too, sensed her passion and was thrilled with the way she handled him, knowing what she was doing to him. And he felt her love through his cock, even through the fact that it was her. He loved her beautiful body. And when they were close up to each other, he couldn't move without thinking to himself that if Marius really fucked her now, he wouldn't have to get to the bathroom to jack off, and then to get to the bathroom himself to clean himself up afterwards! And if they were in the bathroom together, it wouldn't bother her to wash her face and/or wash his cock, and if she was going to do this, it would be their own.</p> <p>Marius was becoming even louder, and his cock felt it's pulse, the veins on his shaft, his balls, and his ass. He felt the pressure in his balls. They were beginning to swell and get tighter. Marius had never heard a man get this excited before. He knew that he wasn't in danger of cumming prematurely. He'd better not. He would have to take his time.</p> <p>Marius was sweating a bit. After a minute of fucking, and his cock was almost to full erection, Marius began to relax his body from the awkward position and lay back, resting his arms on his stomach. For a moment in the midst of having sex, Marius felt as if he were falling into that state of being where he was only briefly fucking. He felt like he would come before the end of the night, just waiting for the end of the world to come to an end. And just as he was about to do so, Marius felt his cock begin to spasm, and felt his cock shoot his first load of cum at the girl he was fucking.</p> <p>He had done it. He had let his cock spurt cum into the air and land on his chest, and the girls face, and the eyes. He had made his cum landing on a part of himself, and not of him. He had allowed himself, to let himself, and his cock. And he felt his cock, his own his seed, his own—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
