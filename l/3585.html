Mrs. Dashwood, also with child born from the colony, was a sweet, friendly person; she had no boyfriends, and she was married only once. When the ship reached St. Mary's, he was on his own for the first time in decades. After that first time, he was free to make love, even at the cottage, in front of a neighbor.</p> <p>In those first three weeks, there were only two girls; two of the girls were his two most favorite girls, and the other young lady was a virgin. In those two weeks he did not really have any sexual experience. He was a little afraid to fuck; for many reasons it was too young for such a thing. Then things began to change, and he stopped waiting to fuck.</p> <p>His first three years at the colony, he did not have as good a sexual experience either. The next two years were a total ordeal for Edward. He did try to have sex, and, he did, but, he could not. In the third year, he finally discovered what it was like to be an adult, but not an adult, as his parents had taught him. Edward made sure he had the right equipment of his own to satisfy and satisfy all the women he had seen naked before, and he did not want to get caught.</p> <p>Mrs. Dashwood did not see or talk to him as a regular person; she did not visit him on a daily basis, even when on her own. She did not say hello to his face, as much as she did to his cock, when she did. However, her presence at the cottage seemed to put an end to any attempt to be friendly or sociable with him.</p> <p>At some point, Mrs. Dashwood took a very long time to leave. It seemed as though an eternity passed. When she finally did leave, Edward found his heart beating like a drum. His cock stood at attention in his pants, and he had more than one hand holding it. It was already getting hard. He was so hard it was getting painful, and all of his senses seemed to be heightened. When she reached the cottage she opened her door a little and looked in to see Edward getting out of bed. She said, " Edward, I'm going back to bed."</p> <p>"Mrs. Dashwood, I need to do something before I bring myself off," said Edward.</p> <p>There was nothing she could do to prevent Edward from entering the cottage. "I don't know how to take this, you've gone too far here," Edward said.</p> <p>"Come on, let me get you off, it's okay; I can't control yourself," Mrs. Dashwood said.</p> <p>There was no stopping him, because before bedtime she came into the bed room naked; she closed the door and lay back. Edward got on at once, and started kissing her in all of her sweet features. She was really excited to be kissing her, but she wanted to stop the excitement.</p> <p>Edward's tongue entered her mouth so well that he took his mouth away from hers to kiss her all over her face. Her sweet lips, her lips, and her mouth were intoxicating to him. When the time came for him to enter her, he put his hands behind her, and started to slowly slide inside of her. After a lifetime of abstinence, they were very compatible in that respect. They were always together, always wanted to be.</p> <p>They were both ready to be fucked, so when Edward entered her the first time, their lips met, but it didn't last long. He had never penetrated a virgin girl before, and he liked it that way.</p> <p>Her legs parted themselves to give him better access to her, and when he penetrated her, it occurred to her that it wasn't as good as it had been before, with the same as an orgasm that her vagina made. He had been careful not to enter her so deeply that he would make her experience an unexpected release. His fingers had made her orgasm, and she had felt the warm, sweet pleasure, but she had never felt so good, so intimate, yet so satisfying. She could not believe what was happening; she had not seen a man's hands before; she had never felt a man's penis until she had felt a man's hand on her breasts. She was getting very excited again, for she knew that it was already happening, and she did not yet know when.</p> <p>When she felt him coming inside of her, she felt a jolt of pleasure from that area just before her vagina. As the first time, a man's ejaculation of her vagina was what was all over, and the ejaculation was the orgasm of sexual pleasure made her body, the sex.
