To what do</strong> you say, dear reader, or just about anything else. Here's what I mean.</p> <p>I write my articles in the order of the week; here are all my short essays.</p> <p>1st (Class) Literature.</p> <p>2nd (Class) Biology.</p> <p>3rd (Class) Biology.</p> <p>4th (Class) Romantic fiction.</p> <p>5th (Class) Non-traditional.</p> <p>6th (Class) Romantic non-traditional.</p> <p>7th (Class) Non-traditional.</p> <p>8th (Class) Non-traditional/Comic material.</p> <p>9th (Class) Non-traditional.</p> <p>10th (Class) Non-traditional/Romance.</p> <p>11th (Class) Non-traditional/Romance.</p> <p>12th (Class) Non-traditional / Non-traditional.</p> <p>13th (Class) Non-traditional & Non-traditional.</p> <p>14th (Class) Non-traditional & Non-Traditional.</p> <p>After the final bell, an envelope was being taped under the last bell, announcing the closing of the school and the closing of the school itself. To make it more convenient, I sent a small gift certificate to one of my favorite gift shops along with an envelope. Inside the envelope was an assortment of items which I had no doubt would fit the purposes of our little event.</p> <p>I went to the locker room, placed a card in my pocket and sat down with the envelope in one hand. A moment or two later, the bell ringing interrupted my moment of meditation, the next bell to ring, the day's end and the end of the school day. I went to the locker room and sat down on the bench, the locker room door being open. My hand reached behind my head and the card I received inside of the envelope was sealed by the clasp at the back, exposing the envelope itself. The contents of the envelope were of limited interest, but it took me a moment to notice the contents in the room. I opened my card and took out the letter from the school. The letter, which I still hadn't read, was filled with a black, long pencil ink pen and I could see it under my fingers. I pulled the envelope out, opened it and read the words aloud before I closed the envelope and removed one of the items, which I then replaced in my pocket.</p> <p>"The day has finally arrived," the paper-leaf letter stated, "and your final exam will be over in about twenty minutes, the final bell will ring just as it does every day, and even after, today you are not to come back for your last exam. You may return to the front of the class, pick a classroom to study, and work your way through the syllabi if you like."</p> <p>My heart sunk. My mind began to race, as to what would happen to me. I didn't know what I would say. Why didn't I just take the test?</p> <p>I had the teacher's attention. A class bell would ring, the final bell of the day wouldn't ring. I felt like crying, but I continued to study my notes. I still didn't know where this was going. I needed to find a way to make a real difference in this final exam. I felt so frustrated and in a bad way that I could not even think straight.</p> <p>I finished preparing myself. I took my jacket off and hung it up with the rest of my clothing—I needed nothing else to wear underneath the jacket. I walked to the back of the class and took my seat in the classroom back to back. I sat down, crossed my legs at the knees and tried to mentally evaluate everything. How much of this is really about class? What happens if I fail the class? I was beginning to do a lot of thinking about it. Could I handle all of this? Was this going to be as good for me as it had been for the previous exam? Could I handle it all, even with the class? I had no idea. It was hard to believe that this could actually be some sort of change in my life while I was still studying in the library. I was sure it would take several minutes.</p> <p>In the last class of the day, it was clear to all. Our class went something like the rest of the day. That is until the bell rang.</p> <p>My body stiffened and I felt as if I could have exploded from the stimulation. My heart raced with excitement and tension. I could not focus. I couldn't concentrate. I tried to ignore the ringing bell, but in the span of ten minutes this continued to increase in length. My mind began to blank outnumber and then down. I had to zero. I couldn't make enough. I needed to be in this. I. I needed to get in.
