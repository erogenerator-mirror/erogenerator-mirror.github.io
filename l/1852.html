As generation is, so also death, a secret of nature’s wisdom: a</h4><p><strong>mixture of elements, resolved into the same elements again, a thing surely which no man ought to be ashamed of: in a series of other fatal events and consequences, which</strong> the old proverb says was not acceptable to the body and the mind. But the last of the old caution and the new ones which no one cared to forget. After the last one had fucked my cock, I started fucking the girls again. But to get the chance to fuck these nice girls, I gave them the chance. And to fuck them, my body was the last one to cum at the end. I had to fuck.</p> <p>At this moment, I had a decision. My first fuck experience would be an easy one.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"Honey, honey, I am really sorry for what I am doing to you. And even if I want to make this sex so fantastic that you would never want to be without the love of your life again," (It may be the most difficult thing for the man to tell that my wife has actually fucked more of the girl of his dreams).</p> <p>"I know you like me better than this. But please don't call this lovemaking my 'fuck'. It is not lovemaking. We both like it in a different way. Please don't call it lovemaking. It's not really lovemaking because we both like it much better together. We both know what it is about. So make love with me. Love it with me. Love it by my body." (She smiled as she used the word "me"; she smiled more).</p> <p>"Oh, honey, really, I love you so much. I'm so glad you've decided for me. Let's finish this session. If we're going to do this again we need time to have some fun and do all this without any worries of future things happening as planned," (She smiled with a happy smile as she looked at me) "Let me just go and change the bed so you can fuck me and then leave."</p> <p>As my wife walked towards the bedroom she looked at me. "I don't mean anything by it. Let's try for a quick finish. I want you to fuck me good and strong."</p> <p>"All part of the pleasure of this session. I hope you won't feel so deprived of the pleasure and pleasure, at least I don't think I will," She said as she smiled from ear to ear.</p> <p>"My pleasure. Thank you. I loved your company so much that before I could do this I was also trying to fuck you."</p> <p>"Do you feel that you can do this? That is the very reason I have agreed to it. Because you are such a good lover that I feel totally blessed. And the pleasure of sex is so important that you must know that if anything else you should feel lucky whether you have sex with me or not. It is so important that I feel that you feel privileged enough to be my lover. But it's also quite important that it makes you feel that you are a special person. That's why I don't want to leave you after this session and not stay the night because of any fear of having to tell a complete stranger. I still love you. We both still are lovers. I love your body. I love your spirit and I really don't understand what you are doing to yourself," (She smiled as she said it) "But we can have the joys of making love and being together because it is what we have done. Don't you feel satisfied with what we achieved? That there is nothing that I cannot say for myself. I'm just glad that I can still love you like this with you. You're much like your husband when he is with me. I love you to much that if I have tried to give you a single night of love it would be enough even though it would take a lot of time for me to find the right man and I couldn't do anything but hold you and give you a few precious words of gratitude for that. Now you're mine." "Okay. I feel very well."</p> <p>"You can sleep for a day or two and then come with me back to my house. I hope you will feel happy for one day," (She smiled and smiled again) "But you'll definitely need to clean, don't you? And when you come down we can talk in a cup of tea. I think a little tea is in order" (She took a sip of tea and smiled as she held it for a second). "I know that I promised you the evening session, don't I?" (A smile.) "Yes, you did" (A grin.) "Of course."</p> <p>As I lay on the bed watching the TV, I noticed something: I noticed my wife walking to the bedroom. My heart was already running a mile. In spite of everything that went on during the evening session, I felt a little sense of excitement when she entered the bedroom and saw that she was carrying a box on the bed. My heart of joy! I didn't feel excitement that she's wife must—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
