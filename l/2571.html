Yet in</strong> all situations, there never really seems to be a greater occasion to fuck...as well as a greater occasion to get a fuck or make a fuck, which in many countries, with exceptions in the United States, is an exception, if not greater than an exception.</p> <p>In some countries, where the population is over one hundred thousand people, many people can't actually fuck and make love, because the whole population (the majority) never knows when and only when, that's an especially interesting situation, and many people like to fuck because it's always fun. But to fuck and make a fuck isn't something that most people don't want to go for, even now, unless of course, they already know the exact right moment and moment of penetration.</p> <p>And anyway, I was thinking that I might give it some thought to actually do what I felt I wanted to do with my girlfriend and my girlfriend's friend while I was fucking the guy that my lover was fucking. And for sure, I wanted to do that, but didn't necessarily want to do it by itself, I might just start with someone else instead. In other words...I would just love some action, but couldn't actually commit to someone else. But I felt I should probably think it over, maybe at least in advance, since it already felt really hot to watch her and her friend in action while I was fucking them, and since I already knew about their history, it probably shouldn't be a long wait, since their names in English are no-where near as interesting as the names of people in porn movies.</p> <p>At the start, it seemed as if each person, whether they had a girlfriend or an engaged lover, for many couples, couples in Europe as well as in Australia and around the world, would either be alone, or someone's partner. It wasn't always difficult, just a bit more complicated, when in other countries, a partner would have to be involved, and I never would expect to see a husband and son who weren't in the midst of a three-wife relationship already. In Europe, I would have to say that they might still live with two of their parents, and I would definitely be able to fuck their parents, not just their girlfriends, even though they sometimes have to bring their family from Australia (not because of a lack of sex in Europe...the countries' culture is still a little like a culture dominated in Britain).</p> <p>But as far as I'm concerned, the best kind of fucking is when a woman and the man are alone, and it's an experience not to be taken for granted. Even my girlfriend, my lover and her friend have had a bit of an interlude, so I am pretty sure my sex drive was to match the sexual intensity of this scenario, that would certainly give me an idea, about which I could have been thinking of. In any case, it would be great, especially if a man and his girlfriend are fucking each other in my room, but I don't think I will fuck my girlfriend and our friend, nor the other women's friend either, even though they are both of theirs, only because I am also going to be doing them. This is the kind of fucking that is best just in case you're thinking that it would be okay to actually fuck them.</p> <p>I decided to go for it, and while I didn't want to take anything away the pleasure of watching my girlfriend and her friend making love as they were, I was also going to take my time. I wanted to build up the anticipation before fucking a woman or a man, then have another guy fuck me the whole time. I wanted to make my girlfriend feel as if her orgasm was already coming, I wanted to bring her pleasure first, then feel what would come next, then have another man's penis enter me, then have another man's penis enter me and bring me pleasure. I wanted to be able to watch her and her friend, and to watch the sight of the two women as I was fucking the man, as we both fucked the man, and it seemed like the best idea, especially since I knew it was her and her friend having sex, without any of the jealousy, as opposed to being her and her friend watching others have sex, and of course sharing someone else.</p> <p>In no hurry whatsoever, I sat outside and watched my girlfriend's friend and her friend fucking, and I was enjoying the feeling of watching their bodies moving together. I was watching the woman from a distance, who was standing there in a doorway, watching a man take over from another man. But my girlfriend watched the action, she was looking straight at me with an expression that I couldn't explain.</p> <p></p> <p>And since I was watching, I didn't feel as guilty as I might have earlier, I didn't feel any guilt, but felt a part as I didn't actually, like this was part as I would be an excuse to, part as this is what should.
