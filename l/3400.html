G. Wells </h3><h4>THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL.</h4><p><strong>I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill, sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to Leatherhead. I</strong> was on top of the bed, but it did not matter. I was alone.</p> <p>I awoke that next morning. The only thing that was holding me up was the sheet covering my nakedness. I looked down and saw my naked body lying next to the bed.</p> <p>With all that had happened in the last three days my sex life had been over. A couple times during the week I had been fucked once in a roomful of friends, then a couple times in a motel room and then several times on a plane ride to Phoenix. At least I was getting laid and the sex wasn't boring. By Monday morning I was already awake.</p> <p>I reached over and rubbed my hand across my pussy. The wetness was there. I rolled over and took my hand away, and looked down at it. In a daze I opened my legs and touched my wet pussy. I felt my orgasm coming. I started to caress my clit as the waves shook my body. It was like I had been drugged.</p> <p>When I got up I took off my robe and looked at myself in the mirror. I liked what I saw. I couldn't believe I was getting off on thinking about the men that I had been with. I smiled and ran my hand over my body, spreading my legs and rubbing in the moisture there.</p> <p>Looking back at myself in the mirror I smiled, too, when I looked at the image of a man's erect cock. It was bigger than I remember looking at a movie, long and thick, with a prominent mushroom shaped head. I liked this thought on more than just my sex life.</p> <p>Next, I lay down across the bed again. I knew from past sleep talk that if you really thought about sex you wouldn't orgasm until two or three times a day. I felt a thrill going up my spine.</p> <p>I sat up and watched the screen as I made myself cum. I heard a moan as my legs got weak and began to shake. I felt a finger slowly moving under my pussy. I spread my legs wider and moved my hand to it. The finger slid smoothly inside my wet pussy, and I closed my eyes and groaned.</p> <p>I opened my eyes to look again at the screen. We were staring straight at the screen. I heard him moan again, as my orgasm crashed through my body. It sent a flood of juice right to my hand as I watched a man moan for her to lick her pussy juice from his dick.</p> <p>It was so hot. I felt a strange feeling. I was getting turned on again. Just watching a porn star in my mind's eye. The sensation felt good. It was nice. The sex was wonderful. There was something else in my mind that I liked. I didn't remember masturbating that day and I could only imagine what I would do.</p> <p>I let my fingers slide out of my sopping wet pussy and lay again on the bed next to the imaginary dick on the screen.</p> <p>I started to dream that someone had just pulled me away from the bed. It was a dream. I don't remember exactly what it was. Maybe that's why it felt so good. Who gave me such wetness all over?</p> <p>My hand started to play along with the wet pussy of the guy on the screen. I found myself masturbating more often and I let my mind get lost in those pleasures.</p> <p>I kept thinking of the last time I ever had sex. That was the first time I ever wanted to have sex and it was with a guy I was only interested in in business. It was with a client whom I was only thinking about work.</p> <p>I felt my orgasm coming as my finger slipped into my pussy. I fingered myself faster and faster as the pleasure built in my body.</p> <p>I kept thinking, what am I doing. I know it was wrong. The pleasure from my fingers felt good. I want to do what that man would make me do to him in that hotel room where we could take his mind away from whatever it was that he would be making me do when I went home. I want to take him to that hotel. I don't want to do it with him right now.</p> <p>I looked at the screen again and I could see the man moaning as I had imagined myself doing and he was giving her to me. Suddenly I thought of my lover in his office, talking to her, taking her over his desk.</p> <p>I thought about what could I do next. Maybe if I was able to put something in my mind next it would be something just like this.</p> <p>The hand in my pussy moved and I came with wave after wave of pleasure. I groaned and moaned into the pillow as my legs shook over again climaxed through my legs. I moaned loudly.</p> <p>"I moaned "My lover"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>the man... my lover!</p> <p>the ladyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
