So as Law of Nature, the giving and taking; the being of the Earth, and the taking of the Law is all very sacred and the giving and taking. Thus there is very, very nice saying, 'the giving and taking' in this book.</p> <p>The giving and taking are not always the same, but when it seems as if you don't have the will, you can make that day. So with this book, and an entire library, in his or her own way we should be able to give and take. For now, please enjoy it; you haven't yet made your decision, yet, let's not bother.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was still dark and it was easy to look out the windows. It was still dark and I didn't feel safe; but after about an hour we had decided to go ahead with it and that was the end of it. The following morning we parted, leaving the library closed and the two of us walking slowly down the steps, we came up to our own door and after opening it, I put a key in it and it unlocked. It wasn't difficult to use the key while standing outside like that.</p> <p>For the first time we made as if we were in a small motel room and got out our own key again. After looking through our own belongings, we entered our own room and after looking around, we went for our things and I had some food and we slept nude through the night.</p> <p>The room itself felt soft and cosy and the first day was really beautiful. We could hear and read very well, no doubt we were in our own bathroom. We were naked, I was still naked and was waiting to meet someone, when suddenly I saw him lying naked on the bed looking at us, he had a hand on my ass and slowly playing with it. What an amazing situation to be in, and I didn't know whether he had ever touched a woman like this, but suddenly I felt that too, I felt him rubbing my buttocks. I was lying naked on the bed and he was stroking my asshole and I was already horny so I could spread my legs and his hand could be between my legs and start to play with my cunt. I was lying there on the bed, I didn't even know my husband was doing it because I was thinking of my last night with him, when I went home after him and told him what I had done yesterday. In my heart I knew he had fucked me, but didn't know his name as I didn't have any names.</p> <p>I felt that he had really enjoyed playing with my ass and I loved it but didn't know who he was. As he was rubbing my ass one moment I was thinking of him fucking me again, this time in a bed with nobody else but himself, even with my own husband, and I never felt like this. I didn't want to lose him. We hadn't kissed and made a move and now we were fucking standing there while he was on top of me and we were kissing, it was incredible and the whole situation was a bit crazy.</p> <p>After he kissed me very good, I got the feeling that he didn't want to leave my bed while he just liked me there, but he didn't leave my bed while we were going to make love, he wanted to do that every time we were naked, now that we had had more than a few things already. We were just lying there on the bed, I didn't know where he wanted me lying or on my back, he just wanted to be around during the time we got ready for something. Besides I didn't know if he would like to be standing close because this was just what he wanted.</p> <p>I was waiting for him to enter me and he was very anxious now. He put his hands on my ass and made me sit up on the pillow and then took me and sat down and pulled me back towards him, again with the pillow, and my legs were spread apart and he started to kiss me once again. After a while I was feeling his hardness against the inside of my thighs. I wasn't sure if he was actually getting ready, or if he was taking a chance that I would be so aroused when he entered me.</p> <p>I didn't know if he would really fuck me, and I didn't care really. That's when I knew I didn't want him to leave. I had gone down my initiation. He had taken the same place as was before me, and before now it was just kissing and fondling my body, to my pussy. He took his time, he took time, not having his love and it in the experience for what he wanted and I was making it for him. I was the place.</p> <p></p> <p>A long time.
