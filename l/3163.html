M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXIII. Anne Comes to Grief in an Affair of Honor</h4><p><strong>ANNE had to live through more than two weeks, as it happened. Almost a month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode, it was high time for her to get</strong> it on with that man. She couldn't wait for her time to end.</p> <p>"Let's go."</p> <p>"What!" she hissed.</p> <p>"It's not about you anymore. It's about me. Let's go," he whispered. "I still love you."</p> <p>"You know I'll do anything to make it up to you," she purred as she put her hands to her eyes.</p> <p>"Anything?" he asked.</p> <p>"Anything," she murmured. "As long as you love me."</p> <p>"Yes everything," he promised her as he kissed her. "It's all I ever wanted and better then anything."</p> <p>"And it's all I remember," she murmured as one of his hands left her tit to slip up under her skirt. "You can fuck me anytime and all I want is you."</p> <p>"Oh you wish," he moaned as she slipped down on the seat to press her thighs against his crotch. "You want my cock?"</p> <p>"Yes I do," she gasped.</p> <p>"Do you want my cum?" he teased against her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Yes," she cried with pleasure. "Fuck me...give me your cum."</p> <p>"I can't wait," he promised as he slipped his fingers in to her hole. He'd had his fill of that for ages. He could tell she couldn't get enough of him.</p> <p>"Please," she begged.</p> <p>"Please what?" he growled in reply.</p> <p>"Please fuck me," she said as her clit throbbed against his fingers. "Please can I have your cum in my pussy?"</p> <p>"I think...if you put it into me it'll get even better," he promised.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she moaned as her pussy tightened and her orgasm surged over her.</p> <p>"Oh yes," he cried as he watched her beautiful face.</p> <p>He lifted her off of him as his fingers slipped from inside her and she leaned into him her eyes fixed onto his.</p> <p>"I love you so much." He felt her hand reach around behind him for his ass.</p> <p>"We could fuck at least once," she purred as he leaned down to kiss her neck.</p> <p>"What's your name?" he asked.</p> <p>"Mia," she replied.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck your ass," he promised her.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," she sighed as he pushed his way inside her. She couldn't believe what she was feeling. She hadn't been completely honest about herself. She didn't think she wasn't capable of feeling like some sort of slut. At the back of her mind, she still didn't know how the man was going to behave with her. When it was time for her to get her wish, she couldn't wait anymore. She just hoped he wasn't going to stick around long.</p> <p>It was like one of his hands on her tit was taking that back from her. It was like he was caressing the softest skin, tracing her nipple like he had when they were making love; but with his thumb pressing just right as he was fucking her, he was caressing her breast, making it just that much more sensitive. She'd never felt like before, like that with anyone else. She was losing control.</p> <p>"Oh my," she whispered. Even though she had just cum, she felt like she was in control. It felt like a woman was going to take more of him inside her. It felt good. It felt so good.</p> <p>"My turn," she called out.</p> <p>"What?" he questioned. His cock hardened as he pushed it into her ass once he had it up inside her. Mia didn't answer until he thrust it harder down her ass.</p> <p>She couldn't believe how hard he was pounding her ass. It felt like a giant cock was ramming into her stomach. There was no one else there.</p> <p>"Harder," she instructed him.</p> <p>"Yes we're being fucked in the ass," he yelled as another orgasm surged through both of them.</p> <p>"You ready?" she asked him as he started to withdraw.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Make me cum," Mia asked. A second later, he thrust her back into her seat as his cock slammed into her pussy over and over.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she begged as yet another orgasm approached. "Please let me have your cum in my ass."</p> <p>"I won't," he promised her. "I promise never to forget it. I know you want to. I know you do," he assured her as his shaft returned to her ass. She felt like a warm liquid that hot flesh as it had just kept thrust in. It's way out of that she held her ass. I kept on the other side as it in her assâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
