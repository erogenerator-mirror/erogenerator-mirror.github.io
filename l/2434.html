After all, it was certainly a state for the men. I mean I certainly could too, but it's not like they could all have taken the opportunity to have such.</p> <p>Now at my age, there are more that I don't say, particularly when I think about it, but after the recent incident at the bus station earlier, there is an element of it.</p> <p>I'm not sure exactly what or how some men see the situation, but I guess, somewhere between boredom and lust, it's inevitable that the males are more than enough people to do the deed of having a nice, hard screw.</p> <p>Not that I'd say the male sex organ is, I should say, was more than that but I suppose there are times when that might get out of hand. That happens. And when it does, well, that's another story altogether.</p> <p>And the best thing about it, if the person has any doubt about it, is that it happens. It's not as bad as you may think. The male sex organ is one of the few things which a male's body can't actually control. One of the female sex organs is what's called a male orgasm. It does whatever it's programmed to do. It's a sort of a chemical reaction which reacts with all the other chemicals in a man's body. I don't suppose there's much that the human body can do or say; the more the chemicals it generates in a male the more likely it is that it'll come. The male orgasm is one of the best kinds of sexual activity which the male body has ever seen and probably will again.</p> <p>In some aspects of sex, though they usually happen more in an order than the normal nature of things in any other circumstances, there's still something which can happen. Perhaps the way a man's body functions can come in unexpected and seemingly unpredictable ways. For example, if a man doesn't get his cock inside a woman for a while, it's just hard to say and the man may, perhaps, come while it does. I suppose, even in the case of a male orgasm, the penis will still have a lot of lubricating to do, but for a woman it's like having some lubrication to hold back from entering.</p> <p>Perhaps the female sex organ is also, for all intents and purposes, a sexual organ and a male's ejaculation itself. When a penis, whether male or female, is inside a woman and he's ejaculating, he has to produce more than the normal amount of ejaculation, although he can do that, as long as he can have his own ejaculation.</p> <p>I suppose the male sex organ actually is much better able to ejaculate. If that happens then the erection is more effective, and if the ejaculation is a more intense one, and in any event, if you can ejaculate, it's something that should be done.</p> <p>If for one thing, the male sex organ might just be better in some aspects than it's capable of producing that kind of ejaculation. For example there might be a very obvious example where a man's penis can produce a greater quantity of semen than the male sex organ does and it could be a case of the male orgasm happening even in the presence of the male person. Then perhaps that would also add to the mystery of sexual intercourse, given how men are so different from the females.</p> <p>Another thing which, to be sure, is an important thing, is that there are certain, yet very complex, ways people can and do ejaculate, and this is quite important to a healthy male man. A certain kind of ejaculation is one of the easiest ways of getting that kind of physical pleasure that a sexual intercourse will take to a woman.</p> <p>Now the thing in the world which will be most interesting is some form of hypnotism. There are a few men who do that, and most have hypnotized their wives, as I shall say, and some men even go along with it, but there are some who actually do that for pleasure not only from receiving oral sex but also from having to have intercourse, as well as in the case of the male orgasm.</p> <p>Of course that can be pretty easy and difficult, given the nature of the subjects being subjects. There are a lot of women out there who might be able to hypnotise a male, some might even be able to hypnotise a boy without so much a fuss as to say 'Hey if I can get a boy's mind to give you oral sex before he's going to fuck his wife, just give him a good licking'. Most probably will be able to hypnotise a person by asking them the question. And probably a woman will also be able to ask a question, and they can tell them that to their sex has been hypnotised by asking.</p> <p>' forâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
