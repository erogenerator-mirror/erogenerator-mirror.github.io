I also will fuck the way that the Law of God gave me." In response to one of his earlier question, we both began to laugh. "Yes," I agreed, "I guess that is what you are after, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, but for the benefit of the audience, he continued, saying, "After all this has been a pleasure it is time you get a piece of heaven."</p> <p>"Yes, I will. I'll do exactly what you want me to do."</p> <p>"Not so fast," I cautioned him, but continued, in a whisper, "I might just want you to take my butt plug. For all your other sins, what they are, you will still have a nice butt-plug inside your rectum."</p> <p>He smiled at me with a warm little smile that told me that he had gotten to the point that I had put the idea in his head. I was starting to get that feeling that he actually wanted me to fuck him, if only I could do just this one time.</p> <p>"Let's give you a chance then. It's your lucky day."</p> <p>"I've never done that before," he said, "and when you feel the first hard sting of the tawse, just move your butt as far forward as you can so that there won't be any pain."</p> <p>"There are times when there are worse times," I replied, grinning broadly. "However, now seems to be the right time to start."</p> <p>I started running my hand over his backside. He squirmed slightly at first. "Relax, baby—I'll be gentle." He didn't protest.</p> <p>"There are other times," I reminded him, while continuing to hold his body with both palms down. "Now is the right time, don't you worry." I leaned in and blew my hot breath on his anus. "I'll do that for you for the rest of the year. I promise."</p> <p>My warm breath felt good—how the God knew how hot it was going to be, after what they had done. He looked over his shoulder at me as I put the hood of the butt-plug up and pulled it out of his butt. His breathing started becoming heavier. I pushed it back into him before I pulled it back out, causing him to cry out. He tried to hold himself still, but soon succumbed to the stimulation. I put the hood back over his eyes again and then gently put my hand over his mouth while the tawse was still in him, telling him it was no longer pain but pleasure—a sign that he was indeed a woman.</p> <p>"Oh, it's you I love," he said, "so beautiful, so warm, so sexy, your asshole so beautiful, I want to come inside of you."</p> <p>"I always get so turned on when I get excited," I assured him. I couldn't wait, if I had only been a moment away. "I can already see that someone who is just so sexy isn't going to be able to hold out long enough to take my cherry." And then my tongue made that unmistakable contact with his anus, and I was on the brink myself. "Do you like my tawse?" I asked him, while still stroking my mouth over his face. "Do you like my mouth and tongue?"</p> <p>"Oh God, you're going to make me explode if you don't finish this."</p> <p>"Just wait, I want to suck you dry," I said, sucking one of his nipples between my lips and squeezing his buttocks with both hands. "I'll finish it when you do."</p> <p>I couldn't wait, and I did my best to swallow every drop of sperm that I was about to receive—and I did. When I had gotten every drop, my mouth was off him and I was kissing and nibbling his body as he recovered—and then I was in the chair again, kneeling before him.</p> <p>"Are you feeling any better?" I asked him. "Would you like to try a different position?"</p> <p>"Yes! That's wonderful. I think I still need to come before I can move."</p> <p>"Are you all right?"</p> <p>"I'll be OK. I'm just starting to get use to the tawse."</p> <p>"Thank you. Well, don't get any ideas about what is going to happen. Take your clothes off and lay down, I want to do it all over you."</p> <p>We stripped off together. I was so eager to be fucked by my lover and to watch him suck my lover; it all over, that I never thought that there was a bad man's would ever going to be a great for me. The Law, and was not. This night had only for me. He's going.
