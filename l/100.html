The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in</strong> the afternoon. I was quite relieved and hoped that I would hear from him shortly. I had forgotten how many rooms this very place had. I didn’t mind. I knew that I had a job to do. I called him.</p> <p>He answered the phone and invited me to look into the bedroom for my first night’s entertainment. I looked around and found everything well away for me to do my job. I was more than happy. The bed was already occupied. The lamps were on the counter, a couple of bottles of wine chilling on the counter and a tray laden with chocolate covered strawberries lay ready for me to enjoy. I turned to leave. I didn’t see anything. Then I looked down the hallway. There was Holmes. He smiled when I walked in his bedroom door was open but didn’t look all that much like me. His body was as naked as a newborn baby on the bed. His face was red and his hair hanging down around his shoulders. He turned his head with his mouth parted while his body slowly shook. He looked at first at my face then down to look at his cock. It was half hard. I was fascinated by it. It was enormous. I touched it while looking at his face and could not stop myself from admiring it. I had not thought a cock could be so large. It wasn’t too long. I leaned and gently sucked on it. It was too big and so soft. I slid my lips down, taking more of it inside of my mouth and feeling its warmth. There was so much of it that I barely knew where to start. I had an idea that I could take it all and go on fucking in and out every time. Maybe if I sucked him for an hour afterwards? I didn’t know.</p> <p>I was amazed how many small movements I made. Sometimes I was sure I would have missed it completely. I held on with my mouth firmly attached to his cock and my hand stroked his heavy member.</p> <p>“It’s too big! I can’t take it!” I said loudly in a high tone of voice. I could hear in the speaker that Holmes was no longer in the hallway and if he did come into the bedroom that his cock would be in my mouth by now.</p> <p>I could almost hear his moan when it hit the roof of my mouth. My hand kept squeezing and stroking his cock without even opening my lips and feeling it move around inside. Suddenly his hand came up to the top of my head and his fingers combed through its hair and held my mouth against his cock. His hips lifted and his cock went right in my throat. It hit the back of my throat and I knew I could barely take it all. He pulled out of my mouth.</p> <p>“Do you want to eat a cucumber or do you want to eat two bananas?” He asked me.</p> <p>I looked down at my penis. It was standing in the middle of the room. It was big. It had to be twice that size and as big around as my wrist. I hadn’t done a double with my legs wide apart and it hurt my legs to move them. I didn’t really know that I could have taken it. I couldn’t have imagined being able to do such a terrible thing. I looked at it again. He was a man and I had to have a cock so it would fit. I felt more excited about having a cock.</p> <p>I took his cock in my hands and placed it near my mouth. I ran my lips over the head and he seemed not to mind and went ahead. The head passed my lips, the thick shaft rested at the top of my mouth. I held the shaft firmly. I could not really hold it. I could not have imagined it could actually happen. I could only believe that it was happening. Now that I had a mouth full of his cock I realized that I could easily handle it. Then I let go of it and moved my lips down.</p> <p>His cock was big and very hard. I couldn’t keep my hands on it and couldn’t close my lips around it. I touched it with my tongue as I started licking it from base to tip. I opened my mouth and licked his balls and then the underside of his cock without ever taking it in my mouth. I felt something moving against me and my body jerked. The feeling was unbelievable. I felt as if it could not ever be the same. I took the shaft into my mouth and started to move around its thickness. At that point I didn’t care what a man was in my mouth, just my mouth. My mind was completely fixed. His balls to my cock it. I was the only that and I was an expert to everything.
