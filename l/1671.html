At the same time, she enjoyed every touch on her body and she loved feeling sexy and empowered in being with her lover rather than being the passive recipient of his desires. She still hesitated in being so sexually explicit in her own fantasy but in the moment, she realized that she wanted to be the aggressor in their sexcapades. Her fantasies were a bit wild even for the conservative conservative woman of the day and these were only the beginnings of erotic fantasies that she was going to experience. She was going to discover more about her lovemaking than she would with her husband as a lover.</p> <p>Edna would soon be in heaven in her own hotel room with a partner with whom she could express herself in a lover's embrace. Although she was nervous about taking full responsibility for her sexual life, she felt that if he did not want her to continue enjoying things with him as much as possible, she could not resist. It would have been rather nice for them both to move on with their lives.</p> <p>One of Edna's early fantasies for the future would be to become a doctor specializing in dealing with STD's. Her fantasy included a man who would treat her sexually, but she hoped that he did not know the extent of sex disease. Her husband knew only that she was sexually active for whom she was not sexually attracted but when he was on the phone with Edna, he would be the first to suggest and correct her condition. He would help her become more knowledgeable in the use of her sexuality when they lived together as their spouses.</p> <p>The reality would be far more than she could allow herself to experience. Although Edna was not ready to have sex with another man's cock, she could never be happy enough to have sex with another woman's. She had an experience on the other hand but had never thought that she would experience such exciting, sexual contact with another woman.</p> <p>However, she enjoyed the sexual excitement and fantasy of her first experience. She liked what she had experienced with the man she had been with but that she did not find exciting. She had only done such things in the past two weeks and she now enjoyed her first lesbian experience.</p> <p>She felt that she should start a new relationship with an attractive, middle-aged couple, not just for the first time. After all, she had done these things before and she knew that she wanted to do them again. So that she could explore her sexual side, she wanted to explore herself more and have more experiences with her lover.</p> <p>With her newfound confidence in herself, she began getting on her best behavior as a sexual partner. She had started to do more than just have sex; she had started to explore her own sexuality. Her first sexual encounter with another woman was her first lesbian experience. She now knew that she would have enjoyed a long term sexual relationship with someone else, someone who she felt would love her and give her the satisfaction which she needed.</p> <p>She looked forward to having her first sexual experience with a man.</p> <p>A very excited Edna and her husband returned to his room. After she cleaned herself up and dressed, she looked for a suitable partner to satisfy her fantasies and to hopefully be able to fulfill her future fantasies. For the moment she did not want to be bothered by any other woman but a man.</p> <p>Her favorite fantasy for the future was of a man fucking her, a man who would take care of her while her husband went away to work. And, Edna wanted more and more.</p> <p>There would be lots of times during the next thirty-eight hours or so that she would need to be available. She had to come up with at least two new lovers as a lover; she thought these would all be men. She was going to enjoy the sex and she wanted sex as much as possible. She wanted to have sex with a variety of men. And, as she had experienced with multiple partners, as she had learned from other partners, she thought that it would be nice to have them join her in her bed while she slept. She would like to use one of her favorite toys while sleeping.</p> <p>For the past twenty-six hours, she had gone through a series of sexual dreams, both of them of men and men's cocks. She always imagined doing those things with other women with her partner. And, as she thought about it, she was a bit scared about having sex with men.</p> <p>In Edna's mind, she was not a man by any stretch of the imagination nor would she feel comfortable being so sexually open to another man while she was sleeping. So, Edna made the decision and she became a willing participant in her new lesbian experience.</p> <p>The night was definitely going to be sexual.</p> <p>for many good because Edna was going to happen and some women would come over on their heads with Edna and Edna.
