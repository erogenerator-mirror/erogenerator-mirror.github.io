I'm not sure why, but my own pleasure at sex is such that it is a source of pleasure for me even if my own needs remain unadventurous, and even I will not be so easily denied, even if my own joyous delights are denied, in any case, there is certainly time for my release, too.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" I shouted, even though I could feel my own climax approaching, "Fuck!"</p> <p>The moment was fleeting, for however brief it seemed, as before there was no way for me to stop myself. I couldn't have, had either of the people to give me their full attention at that point, for there was something that I would have liked to have taken over me, even if it was so fleeting they would probably think I should wait until I knew more, in fact, even if we did manage to complete our love at that moment.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is something that is, to put it bluntly, a gift which I will not give my own life, because that is, as much as anyone, I am not at all in touch with who we are, or where we are. That is, of course, because I love you as much as I love any man, man or woman, in fact; not that I would ever have imagined I would love another without first having tasted you, or feeling you enter me, even in the absence of the taste of what is called "firm penetration itself", although the taste of this particular meal cannot be anything less pleasant than what comes through the taste of the wine we have consumed. For that, dear, I will say whatever pleases you. For anyone else, I may have tasted you differently before this, but, really, it seems like my most intimate appetizer, too.</p> <p>"Yes! Yes!" I shouted, as it could, without anyone else looking, I said, as the moment reached its peak. It seemed like an eternity, and the feeling became more intense from the very start.</p> <p>"Jesus!" I gasped, "Please don't stop, my beautiful goddess," I begged, "Just...fuck!" It was the first words I ever said, and it felt so nice, so wonderful, that as before I could hold back no more. We went at it. I mean, I've thought about it, I've thought about all this, but never, even at the last moment, I'll say anything. I mean, I wanted to do it, but it didn't feel right at that point, and, anyway, after all, I'm the goddess of love and you're the bride of honor, and I'm only your girlfriend, because that's all that counts.</p> <p>And I guess it was the whole point, right? I mean, the point was so very close to "not really knowing." Now, though, it was an admission of truth, just like, you know, it's kind of embarrassing to say such a thing. But, you know, it wasn't a question of whether you were enjoying it, it was a question who you were fucking. It was a question I've thought about, and I'm certain it was not about the last person to whom I was in intimate contact. And, no, yes, I think part of that was just the fact that if it was just for a moment, you, me, it would be worth it to give this experience a truly intimate kiss. I know you wouldn't have been in a position to do so, but it's hard to ignore the thought of having my lips between yours, and even better, the smell to you of my own perfume mixed with your own excitement. Well, that's just you I'm referring to, because of what you were doing, and, as you know, this kiss was very special, indeed. Yes, you are one very beautiful woman, I confess, and to have you as mine as one as one of my men could be, or want to be, was the most delightful thing I could ever imagine doing to you. And as I had intended this moment, I would do anything for you, just so, the feeling was so special.</p> <p>"Oh God yes!" I cried, "Please..."</p> <p>We had kissed for a long while, and my feelings had been well and truly returned, but my feelings were far distant, and I do remember saying that I felt such a certain intimacy as I do when a man is inside his lover's vagina, as I would, of course, if he was. It's just something I've come to understand the joy of such sensations, and, of course, as soon as the kiss came to an end, I went on top of what I might have already been doing, and gave all that a very special kiss. What it's the very special, and complete experience again.</p> <p></p> <p>And I do you can also haveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
