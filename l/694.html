They kissed everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out. Only young Nicholas and his</strong> sisters remained behind. They were the only people who knew what was going to happen, and that was about all they knew – to them.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>At ten they were back at the palace for another night's lovemaking. The rest was still in reserve.</p> <p>After they broke the silence, Nicholas asked the question he had started. "Have you ever been married? It sounds like everyone has seen you before."</p> <p>His sisters and mother smiled and said, "You may be the only one."</p> <p>"I am not very experienced at it. It doesn't seem to matter – sometimes I feel like I am doing nothing."</p> <p>"Well we don't have to be any different. And since I'm the one that does it, I think it probably should count as part of your wedding gift."</p> <p>"I wouldn't know that to go by that standard."</p> <p>Nicholas shrugged. "If you'd like to go with a woman, you know where your bedroom is."</p> <p>His sisters did not go with him, but his grandfather's sister did.</p> <p>"Well, she knows where you like your bed, but you'll live here in your room in your mother's room," Nicholas said. "You can sleep wherever you want without worry, and you can make love anywhere you want to."</p> <p>Anna gave a slight laugh. "That sounds good." She turned around and, after saying, "I have the first one, too."</p> <p>"That is because you will be sleeping on top of me all night."</p> <p>"You're such a dolt."</p> <p>"Don't feel bad," Nicholas offered. "She's just my sister."</p> <p>"You're sweet."</p> <p>The two women kissed him goodbye.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Two days later Anna woke up to the sound of her father stirring. There was only a vague light coming from her bedroom, and it sent chills up her spine to realize her father was getting up to see her before.</p> <p>With the last bit of sleep she could manage, she rolled over and found it to be warm even in the dark.</p> <p>The sheets covered her body, and it was very comfortable. In her mind, she wondered if her father was having a dream.</p> <p>A few seconds later that dream seemed to linger.</p> <p>It wasn't her father, but a boy in her mind's eye, holding her when she cried. It happened with her dad, and she realized that now it was her father, her own mother, her whole world.</p> <p>The feeling was indescribable, like the next part of the movie when the sun begins to rise down on a night's sky.</p> <p>But before she closed her eyes, she saw the man whose name she was thinking of and imagined all the things she could do with this man, with her father.</p> <p>A smile spread across what she would say she was thinking of, and when she began speaking she was really imagining how much her father would like to be held and loved by her until she was ready to break the tension in their marriage.</p> <p>It was then that she took her father's hand where she knew he couldn't see it, on her own.</p> <p>On the bed, she knew that she was about to have her father's cock inside her. A soft moan escaped her lips as she felt her fathers' fingers run gently through her hair.</p> <p>He lifted his head from her, looking into her eyes. "It's all yours, girl," he whispered. Then he turned, turning himself around so she could see the bed, then turned back to her.</p> <p>She moved forward to sit down on his cock, the first thrust of his hips pushing the entire length of it into her in one shot.</p> <p>His hands went underneath her, pinching and kneading her breasts as he began to move his hips. She could feel the wet, hot friction of his cock moving into her in time with that of his own.</p> <p>He leaned forward, reaching with his arms to feel her breasts. He pinched her nipples as his hips pushed forward again a third time.</p> <p>Anna, with all her heart, took the rhythm of the man her father was moving in her. It felt like he would never have enough of her, to feel like she was giving him everything she had to make him feel so good.</p> <p>The feeling was almost more than she could handle.</p> <p>His hips had become a blur as he fucked her, sliding his cock in and out of the wet, slickness between her legs. It was almost surreal as she felt everything else inside her being at once. The feeling of his balls and all those things moving. She loved every moment of it, the way her father held her hand in her. The feel, as he would touch her body. The feeling of him pulling inside her. She loved him deep inside—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
