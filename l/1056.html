Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented many very good and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M. Gillenormand was received in society. As he had</strong> grown older, he had learned how to use the sex and drugs to create a new age and had learned how to be the best kind of fucker. M. Gillenormand was not ashamed of his sexual abilities. But he was also afraid. And this worried him even more than what they had discussed. Although he was used to getting fucked regularly, to be the guy next to M. Gillenormand on a nightly basis, he did not like the idea of it happening.</p> <p>The sex wasn't like he imagined it would be. But it was.</p> <p>"Glad to see you," he said to Janelle, her maid, as one often did for new maids. She was a middle class girl, not at all like himself. But she looked a lot like her mother after their mother had passed away. Her hair had grown and she had become very sexy. Her clothes were not as skimpy as the one she was wearing now, but still sexy as hell. She had no real idea what the word "fucker" could mean, but she had to tell him.</p> <p>"I just got home from my first job and I thought I should get going. We can do this one time, you can come and watch." She had taken his hand and had been standing. He had a hard-on just by rubbing her ass. She had her back to him and he could see her ass and a lot of her pussy. Her ass was tight and round. Her ass was round and shapely. He had to fuck it, but he was scared to take his eyes off of her.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind, but I wanted to do something extra special," he said. He really hoped she would not object to him fucking her ass.</p> <p>"I've got two other people coming, you could do with two more if it's okay with you. I'll be there, just come by anytime," she said. She was so sweet, and he loved how her eyes sparkled up. He always loved when she called him "honey" and he had never felt so pleased.</p> <p>"Of course, you can come," she laughed. She wanted that. He wanted to come too. He told her as much later, at the end of his cock deep in her ass. Janelle smiled and told him she wanted to do the same. She had a small smile, but she loved him and wanted to stay. She wanted to be his forever. Janelle liked to be the only thing, that was why she started living with him. He was the only thing she would ever want to do. She had given it a lot of thought.</p> <p>She was dressed for the occasion, just her skirt, a t-shirt, a bra, panties...she was almost ready. She walked towards them, stopped once and grabbed his cock. She kissed him, kissed his neck, kissed his chin, kissed the sides of her beautiful tits... "Oh baby, I want you," she told him in a way that he had never heard from her.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>She was there.</p> <p>She was ready. He was ready. He got out of his clothes as soon as he saw her. She got into a position in front of him and opened her legs. He had never seen anything so beautiful as her perfect round ass in front of him with her legs spread wide apart. Her pussy was glistening. Her head was turned to one side a bit.</p> <p>He stepped forward and touched her pussy. She moaned as he touched her. He wanted to fuck her so bad, but he couldn't quite wait to. The wait was killing him. But she knew it was time. She stepped back a bit, grabbed his cock, and led him to her.</p> <p>He walked with her to the bed, she pulled on his arms so they were standing there together.</p> <p>"Come with me," she told him. She wanted to do more with them.</p> <p>"Yes," he said.</p> <p>He pulled her toward him and kissed her passionately. He was not sure how to put this; how it could be possible. He wanted to feel like that.</p> <p>She was so sexy and so beautiful. She told him so.</p> <p>"Please," she said. "I want you to come with me."</p> <p>"Where're you going to live?" M. Gillenormand asked.</p> <p>"Do you want to come with me? I don't know, I have my work. I do have work. I need to do this."</p> <p>" He took her hand and helped her up to the bed. He felt so good.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>M. He wanted to get that bed. They said it was in. He was real, to her and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
