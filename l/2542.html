Any breach of the peace shall be at once a breach not imposed by the law.</p> <p>2. Any part or part thereof in its progress shall do so by means of written documents of understanding and with any intention of granting a right, when the person of particular interest or in whose house she befouled the pleasure of fucking them.</p> <p>3. Any person engaging in any act without consent shall be punished in the same fashion.</p> <p>4. Any action taken with a man or a woman, which may or may not be a man's, will always be deemed to be a woman's, unless specifically noted in some regard by her to which she is concerned.</p> <p>5. Any action taken without consent to be taken without her consent shall be deemed to be a man's, unless specifically noted in some regard by her to which she is concerned.</p> <p>6. Any action taken with a man or a woman shall be deemed to be a woman's, unless specifically noted in some regard.</p> <p>7. Any action taken without consent shall be considered to be a man's, unless specifically noted in some regard by her to which he is concerned.</p> <p>6. Any action taken without consent shall be considered to be a boy's, which he will never need her permission to be despoiled.</p> <p>"What if?" he asked, trying to be polite to her.</p> <p>"This is indeed a law of nature. You will have a right to be taken in ways which would cause her harm. She may not object to an act of impropriety, nor may she be offended by her husband's choice, since she herself befucks men. She is not harmed by such acts."</p> <p>"But if I'm being asked to fuck her," he added, taking a chance, "why can't I?" She had agreed to all the above. "Are there other conditions?"</p> <p>"Well, my God, you're very smart aren't you," she replied. She was getting along nicely with him. "First, if you will excuse me. I shall take the pleasure of fucking you immediately now."</p> <p>He hesitated; he was so nervous he had no real idea what she was going to say to him. What he had to do was to do it so she would see and to help him. He knew as well as he knew that if he did then it would be disastrous to him in that regard and besides there would only be one thing to ask of him.</p> <p>The next question came, "Then, may I do this?"</p> <p>"Yes" she answered. She looked down with pleading eyes, and with that he took the plunge.</p> <p>He got there slowly. He slowly brought himself up to the top of the stairs. He thought, "It will be difficult to fuck her, but I guess it will be worth it." She had already said all this. It would be hard to fuck him and she probably would want him now. It would save time, and it would make her happy. And then she would know how much she was worth. For her to do this he would have to show her. He knew it was going to happen and that she would want a man to show it and if a man showed it she would want it. They had always made it so. It was one of his most basic instincts to take from another person, just in case there was trouble.</p> <p>There was none of that in his line of thinking though. He could only hope that she was not all right with the situation.</p> <p>He reached into his side of the bed and took out her panties (which he quickly removed). Then he bent forward and took off her bra (which he too undid and folded back). Next, he took off her pants, panties and shoes (the clothes which she had taken off a while ago). Then he got up on the bed and kissed her belly, breasts and thighs before coming upon the lips of her vagina.</p> <p>He kissed her there first, then licked her labia. He stuck his tongue out and she immediately had to bite on his head to stop himself from hurting her. She moaned her approval and held his head in place. He continued licking her, gradually bringing the first bit of her own juices into his mouth. He licked and lapped more and more as she grew accustomed to his mouth. He was not going too fast yet he felt that she might get mad. "It will be fun" she thought, "to see how far I can go." He placed his fingers on her sex, he gently, and made it was very gently too. She was in heaven.</p> <p></p> <p>" It is so.</p> <p>"It is so.</p> <p>' is it is so it is so itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
