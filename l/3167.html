M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXVII. Vanity and Vexation of Spirit</h4><p><strong>Marilla, walking home one late April evening from an Aid meeting, realized that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails to bring</strong>.</p> <p>Sitting at her favorite booth sipping from her first glass of white wine her phone beeped. Lying in bed reading her paperback reading she looked at the message icon above the phone she had to answer it.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Good evening Marilla," a familiar voice said with a husky voice. "You're late."</p> <p>"What? Oh sorry, I was in class," she exclaimed looking at her phone to see the error message.</p> <p>"Did you have a bad weekend?"</p> <p>"Umm yeah I did, I just finished my second book," Marilla said in a quiet tone.</p> <p>Heading to her room she called for a cab with her purse tucked under her arm to pick up their belongings, she was glad to have someplace to go but she was getting ready to take advantage of it.</p> <p>"Hurry up," she whispered. Her heart beat faster as she opened her closet to drop her dress on the floor, she picked up her new teddy, then stood in front of the full length mirror to look at herself. She had long reddish brown hair that hung past her shoulders and down her back. The top of her breasts were barely contained by the garment as she tugged the hem of the teddy up from around her neck until it covered her breasts and stopped mid-thigh.</p> <p>Marilla had not been this sexually active since her marriage and it was the beginning of the fall, when she took a break after work. She wanted to be ready for the summer. This summer was the beginning of the summer break, she remembered that last summer's spring break. It was also the beginning of their new year on their way to their new apartment in Boston.</p> <p>Standing at the edge of her bed Marilla pulled the teddy off and threw it on the floor. Bending at the waste she picked up her white skirt from the floor and stepped into it. As she pulled the skirt over her hips she put her bare feet up on the bed. As she turned to look at the mirror and admired her shapely rear view, a soft moan escaped her lips. The skirt slid over her hips down her legs making her feel light shivers. Looking back at her reflection she smiled.</p> <p>Pulling on her panties she pulled them down to mid-thigh. She had decided to shave a little but her razor could use a trim since it was her first summer since graduation. Stepping out of her panties she turned, admiring her body as her hands roamed up and down her sleek body. Her pussy was completely bare with light blonde hair above her clit. Looking down Marilla could see that the hairs were growing fast.</p> <p>Standing proudly above her bed, she was pleased that her breasts were firm and her nipples were erect. With a small movement of her fingers she caressed her nipples and the smooth skin between her fingers. She loved this part of her sexuality, the erotic part she enjoyed when she did this to herself. As much as she enjoyed it she was feeling more than a little self conscious that she was showing her body to someone so sexually attracted to her.</p> <p>Reaching back to her bedside table Marilla took out a thick strap on dildo. It was the kind that she had seen advertised the previous day on the Internet in her library. She knew that she shouldn't be looking at another woman's sex toy for her next year's college but she just couldn't help but to look at the dildo that she had just bought. It had an amazing harnessing that looked like a harness and had a long, flat head. The harness had been connected to a small, metal dildo and a small dildo was attached that was designed to hold it.</p> <p>The harness was shaped like a real cock; thick, long, and strong. This is where it would feel better for a sexual encounter if she wasn't so uptight about other women. She slid her right hand down and into her pussy, gently rubbing her clit as she looked at herself in the mirror. As she watched her hand slide down the dildo she reached in farther to rub her breast and tweak her nipples.</p> <p>She moaned. Her body was trembling and she felt that the rush would not go away tonight. Moving her left hand from her clit to her slit she slipped just her finger between her lips and began to slide the slippery, slick finger in and out. The pleasure made her moan even louder than she normally does and her body began to tremble as she became more and more turned on.</p> <p>Her desire was evident in the slight trembling and she wanted in some way do to herself or something at all the dildo and it. She wanted it with her mouth or anything at the end of that would please her body. with a dildo. She wanted her tongue, anywhere it. the entire body. Even with the mouth or anything at the strap on her bodyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
