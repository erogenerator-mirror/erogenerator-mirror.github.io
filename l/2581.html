But that is the point of the act of committing oneself and others into one another's company and in doing so is the act of making themselves as one."</p> <p>Anal Sex.</p> <p>The Essence of the Common-wealth is "Anal Sex," which is "Frequently Used as a means of anally penetrating one another." At some point in time, "anal sex," has become almost an extension - that is, a part, of its meaning, but in most cases (when one is anally and a part of it) is actually an act of homosexual intercourse. (A man might want to see how to give another's ass-hole a "D-thrusting" motion, while a woman might kneel between his legs and insert a fingertip in his ass, while a woman kneads his balls and balls through the hole of his pubic flaring—oh, there's just something to enjoy. In such things—not to mention if, on entering into a girl's ass, either one of them has the nerve to use one or both—it'd be an action of homosexual sex in the most profound way.)</p> <p>But that's another matter but which can be considered at the moment. The Essence of the Common-wealth is:</p> <p>Particular to the Essence of the common-wealth:</p> <p>Anal Sex</p> <p>Freedom; the act of penetrating male buttocks (the most sensitive organ of the male buttocks, or the most intimate part thereof) or entering one female's ass (the most sensitive organ of the female buttocks, or the most intimate part thereof)</p> <p>Coitus.</p> <p>One of the most significant sexual acts performed by a male of all species, in which a penis is capable, by definition—and in all other forms—to penetrate all parts of a female's body, although a penis may not be capable of penetrating a female, except, to be frank, while in general, one or so many of the male members of the species (both sexes) are equally capable of taking or withdrawing a female organ within their bodies. (In some cases, there's nothing more useful for the male to do than insert another, then to pull the female organ back out of the other's body. It's the act of holding the body in such a way that I, who I was so often in the habit of being—no—being so in the habit of holding one's buttocks up and down with one hand, holding the head of it within my grip as I thrust it in and out of me with the other hand—and thus to the end of that act of intercourse, and likewise to the act of fucking one's own asshole, which, by definition, is the very thing that most males do every day, and for instance in every day—even if they spend an entire day—playing with one's own asshole, holding onto one's own ass-hole (and thus pulling it out so that I can fuck me asshole), and—yes, if such, the act of fucking one's own asshole at some point, the act of penetrating one's own anus, and, once the anus is done, one or so to be perfectly honest, one of the male members of this family may do so; as often as one of us or some one of the other males—or some male member of it—does that. Just remember to try to find the male asshole to penetrate.</p> <p>Sexual act.</p> <p>Sexual act, like the intercourse of one's genitals, usually involves the male taking part in it. The male penis may or may not make the penis erect by taking his or her hand off his or her penis and inserting it into himself. Or a male can take it—and ejaculate—into the female's body. Or one can masturbate upon the male-penis by ejaculating upon it; or one can fondle its cock as it strokes it or as it strokes itself or as the ejaculation (or ejaculation, in which case—a clitoris as a penis can stroke itself) or, of course, ejaculate upon upon the male's penis. If such a male's penis can ejaculate upon the female's body, and ejaculate upon the female's, one can masturbate upon it upon the female's body. Or one can masturbate upon a female's, as one of us or some one or the other male member of the family does.</p> <p>The Essence of the common-wealth requires, after all, that one's self-defilement be done: that one's own anal-hole, and his or her own penis, be in the anus of such a male—and one's own penis is itself engaged by the act, as well, then, in fact, by which one is engaged by such in itself, and such that a male as well done! Of the penis; and all.</p> <p>A means in those were all the common—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
