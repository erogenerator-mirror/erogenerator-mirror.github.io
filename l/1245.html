Cosette asked him no questions, was no longer astonished, no longer exclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke</strong> the French language, he no longer had any difficulty talking or thinking. "Ah, yes, Jean Valjean." he said. He spoke the words. He didn't speak of the time for sex. He said that that was why he had wanted her. In the midst of having sex with Jean Valjean, in the evening, he had come to realise that sexual relations, even the simple, intimate relations of a young man is not enough. He wanted to have sex with her. So he'd waited an eternity to be with Jean Valjean again and he wished he could have sex with her. He had come when he'd thought a sexual encounter could never happen. There was Jean Valjean. A sex angel and Jean Valjean a human being and Jean Valjean was a human being. In the afternoon, he wished that he had known that she might feel the same thing that he would. It was an hour before he'd realised why she had come back to him. "Jean Valjane." he said. "The words that you said, she didn't have and there was no one who could tell the difference between them."</p> <p>And it was only then that he had realised that Jean Valjane saw no reason to continue having sex. She was no longer a woman. She had given her body over to him. She had given herself to him. There was nothing that could say that that would change and Jean Valjane didn't care. She was a sexual being, Jean Valjane.</p> <p>Her sex life had always been her doing and being. She had just learned from experience how to be a slut. But the sex life became more than what you imagine in porn and, at times, a little more like the one she got. This was not the woman who had gone out with men for a week. This was the woman who was a virgin and didn't think that anyone would want her. If she wanted sex with men, she wasn't asking for sex. As a woman she wasn't asking for sex but asking for a different kind of sex. As a whore Jean Valjane was asking for sex but she wasn't asking for money. She was asking for sex. She was offering sex.</p> <p>So, at a point when her life was almost a living cliché, Jean Valjane went back to bed and let him have his way. The sex she couldn't get again, the sex that was good. But there was nothing to be done about the lack of sexual satisfaction that she had, for any reason, lost. Now, instead of having sex with someone else, she had gone back to her life. And she didn't want her sex with someone else. She wanted someone else. In return she wanted a good life. And she wanted a decent life.</p> <p>As you might guess, Jean Valjane was also as inexperienced as you can imagine. She had never been with anyone, particularly a man. And she had never made a first come, first served. She had never been with a woman. And certainly not with another woman. The whole idea of going for it with Jean Valjane wasn't something she was ready to do. Maybe she was ready to give up and go for it with a woman. Maybe she was ready to stop her life longings with a woman. Whatever the reason, Jean Valjane decided she wanted a decent life. She wanted to give herself to someone and nothing else.</p> <p>But she didn't think that she would ever be comfortable doing that with a man again, even if she was willing to do it again with a woman. Or maybe she thought that her sex life was going to go on for ever. Maybe she was a slut. But she was definitely not thinking that she would ever be an acceptable sex partner to a man again. Maybe this really was how love should end. Maybe Jean Valjane was right, but maybe she wouldn't be a good sex partner.</p> <p>The way that Jean Valjane used her magic made Jean Valjane a whore. And if she was the whore again, she would always do it again. With her. Whenever she saw another woman at a bar that had a regular customer, she would try and arrange it while looking for the right partner for her. If she couldn't find a female lover, she would find another.</p> <p>But Jean Valjane didn't want to try out something that she knew that she might not want to do in a million years when she had been so eager to have sex with men and women together.</p> <p>Jean Valjane wanted to be a whore. More than that because she wanted to be a whore. But, if she went with the right man or right man. Maybe she could even try one of the right man. If she would be man would try to get back on, she was she just to man. Just so as if not just try.</p> <p></p> <p>Even when she needed.
