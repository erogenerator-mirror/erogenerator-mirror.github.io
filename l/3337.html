English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXXX. The Sign.</h4><p><strong>In this discourse, Nietzsche disassociates himself finally from the higher men, and by the symbol of the lion, wishes to convey to us that he has won over and mastered</strong> our religion in the arena of sexual desire, which is our God's word.</p> <p>Let's begin by taking a short break. I want people to think about the obviousness of this lecture. The point is that Nietzsche states that sexual desire was first invented by humans, and now it is known. To put it plainly enough, the first stage of human sexuality is, well, primitive. The need for sexual intercourse has been so long dormant, so long dormant, that the need for it is undeniable - and the very last thing anyone wants to do is make it known, even to their own children.</p> <p>To paraphrase Nietzsche, "In the age of man, we can not, and cannot, have an orgy or another of lustful carnal lust. You can masturbate, but be careful - it will ruin you." If you want to fuck to hell, you have to masturbate on my face. I would love to hold on to your ass so tight I can spank you."</p> <p>In fact, Nietzsche doesn't speak very much about sexual desires, but his own personal desires are well-rounded. To paraphrase Nietzsche, "I love to fuck hard, but I cannot do that with pleasure, for I must be content with what I have." You probably remember the phrase "what I have", but it's not necessary to use it to indicate exactly what you have. What you have is a sexual appetite that we writers cannot fully express, because our imaginations (and our lives) are so long in the past, we are not able to express our selves. If you want to know what I have, then you can read this lecture.</p> <p>In the sense that we can't write about such things, there are probably a number of men whose particular sexual desires are not as primitive as ours are. It is important to keep track of how many men are, and what makes the men so special, because when you are making a choice, you need to be certain to say: one. That is the one you'll never want to be, or to be. You've heard the word, "fuck", again. In this lecture, you will notice that, because you will never be able to get what you want, by being a "fool", you could rather be a slut. That is the one you must be, because it is only a sex act.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if I should say this or not," I said, "but in the first place, does this seem like a common expression of sexual desire? The people who are sexually aware of sexual desire are already deeply sexualized. They are more or less open to sexual pleasure, and they like to be treated as though they are enjoying themselves. And if they are already doing something with, what does the next step matter if I want to say something? If we just agree, and agree that people should not be more sexually aware, than we are, and the sexual experience is mutual, we can say that we both love to fuck, as much as we love to spank. I agree to it. I also agree to it if you insist. However, is it possible, in time, that your parents, if you want, or even think they want, may not ever know that you love to be fucked? I may be able to tell that you do. And if you insist - and even to love to fuck - we can say that you are already enjoying it. I also agree to say that we both think you enjoy sex, but you shouldn't make assumptions. I do."</p> <p>"I don't think you really have to ask this," I said, "but you may not have read my philosophy yet. We, my friends and fellow Nietzsche, are not as primitive as that. We don't understand the feelings of sexual lust, and the pleasure of sexual coupling. We should be able to make this happen for ourselves, but also be able to understand that they are not all animal feelings, when animals are happy. What the animals are happy with, is not lust, but a feeling of pleasure; that is the feeling I am sure we all feel when we are intimate with other animals, even in sexual union, but more like pure animal love than love.</p> <p>I mean that with respect to the moral implications of such ideas... you may not expect, at this moment, that all the people here, and even their offspring, are happy enough to enjoy the pleasures that are created by the human body. You are certainly not the type of human being who would want to be anything less than a very attractive species. But I do. I really do.</p> <p>But even if we are happy by human sexuality, then there are some other animals we could rather enjoy, and enjoy than animals that. If that does not seem to do. That does make us animals all animals happier. But for instance, if humans are not. Yes, as long as long as long as long as life, as life mayâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
