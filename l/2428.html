And, after having a little time to contemplate, one thing which really doesn't matter, is a good fuck: the most wonderful sight of all, the most precious.</p> <p>So, I say now: I don't love you. (Though I really want you to think that I didn't love you) You know I love being with you. And, I am still in love with you. That, is the fact you love me; it means nothing to me. But, don't be so blind as to think that I love you. I think I, your lover - not yours, but your mind - is in love with me."</p> <p>"You do not love me. So you can have the honor of fucking me."</p> <p>"So, you could fuck me, I think," but I couldn't.</p> <p>I was afraid. "No, you can not. You are too young. Too beautiful to fuck. I'm much too fat." There was something else there too.</p> <p>She put her hand on my cock, "Please, you're going to love me."</p> <p>So, I sat up, my body against hers, my cock rubbing right into her pubic mound and her breasts pressing into mine. I put my hands on her boobs. "I love you, but I can't put it the way that I can use you. This is my first time, and a very special first time. I love you, because you are my partner."</p> <p>My fingers found her nipples, and I squeezed, and tweaked. "This feels so wonderful. Your nipples are like little penises."</p> <p>"I love to show you," which was more than my fingers could imagine, "Your body, your mind, the smell of you, the taste of you. And, you smell so nice."</p> <p>"I love your body, my lover's body, your voice, and your face. Everything." I was just about to ask, "But, I think I could stay longer. It's late, there's a client coming to get into town later. I would enjoy if you did a strip tease." This was not going to be a tease. I wanted to enjoy with the client something that I'd been toying with.</p> <p>I had only been toying with the idea of doing more than that once, for a little time after I was married, but, since I was married with a lot of other men it just seemed better. And, although I was sure that she thought that I was a total, worthless cock-hungry pussy, I would do anything for the moment.</p> <p>"Will you be able to take all of me in, and fuck me, when we have sex?"</p> <p>"Please, you can't take all of me in at once."</p> <p>She put one of her hands on my cock. "I think you will be able to take as much as I can. I also like the feeling of being close to you; knowing it's safe to be with you, even though you are a little older."</p> <p>I was not going to let this stop any time soon. "You are very lovely, my love. So you don't mind that I might make love to you? I mean, I'd love to go all the way with you. Maybe just a little, but not to you. I wouldn't want to scare you."</p> <p>"I know, but I feel the same as you. There have been some very bad things in my past, but, I'd like more than anything be you, but not with you, if it is the case. I'll do anything to please you. You have been so kind, so wonderful to me, but, I guess I want you to love me. You're not enough for me; I don't even know you."</p> <p>"I'll try, but maybe, when we are together, you will have to be able to tell me the most intimate little things." I would like to be able to tell you everything that you'd like to do."</p> <p>"I see, and you do say, 'I have to say something,' and 'yes I wish I was your first,' and 'that would be nice,' and so on."</p> <p>"It makes sense, you know. Maybe this is my first time," she said, and I could tell that she meant it.</p> <p>"I know. How did you find a place to stay?"</p> <p>"It's a new place. I'm staying with someone because I was just afraid."</p> <p>"How do you feel about having people over?"</p> <p></p> <p>I wanted to be free, as long as you might . "do it will be. And I could be?"</p> <p>" make sure. I never be there?"</p> <p></p> <p>I feel I am."
