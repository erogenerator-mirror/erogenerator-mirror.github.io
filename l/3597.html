Elinor encouraged</strong> her to let herself be so utterly blissfully happy again that time would pass and she would be able again to feel as happy as she had the night before. Marianne lay on top of Elinor. The two of them lay in their own blissful dream, Marianne feeling herself grow content and Elinor contented. Their bodies pressed into each other. Elinor moved her body to a better position against Marianne.</p> <p>Marianne began to caress Elinor’s breasts. Marianne was surprised when Elinor responded and soon began caressing Marianne’s breasts. It was all very innocent, so not surprisingly Elinor was surprised that Marianne was responding to her touch. But as they lay naked together, Elinor and Marianne’s naked bodies pressed against each other, and Marianne’s hands working on Elinor’s breasts, Elinor’s breasts responding as she had that night before. The sight of Elinor aroused her like never before. Elinor smiled. The two of them were beautiful together. Marianne was so happy she found another man. She was happy to be elated again. They were two lovely women who were loved, but they were two women who were happy.</p> <p>Marianne felt Elinor’s breasts, Marianne’s nipples, Elinor’s vulva. Marianne felt another pair of hands on her face, but as Elinor caressed Marianne’s face the first thing she saw was a penis. It was Elinor’s lips surrounded by a penis. Marianne felt Elinor’s tongue on her vagina. Marianne felt Elinor’s tongue licking her vulva. Marianne felt Elinor’s hands caress Elinor’s breasts, Elinor’s fingers caressing Marianne’s nipples. Elinor’ lips and tongue moved to Marianne’s clitoris. Marianne felt Elinor’s hands on her breasts. Marianne gasped in pleasure as she felt Elinor’s tongue on her clitoris again. Marianne’s climax began to build. Elinor felt her body tremble when Elinor’s tongue did another of its most exotic sexual tricks. Marianne felt hot juices flowing. It was exhilarating, exciting, exhilarating. Marianne began to cry out in passion. Elinor held Marianne tight. Marianne felt a wonderful warmth, not unlike having your heart stopped for two days. Then Elinor pulled away from Marianne and sat up.</p> <p>“No sex with boys,” Elinor said. “I’m too young to have sex.”</p> <p>Marianne smiled and agreed, “It’s ok. I’ll make up for it if you’re willing to stick around to have sex.”</p> <p>Marianne smiled and looked down at Elinor. Her eyes were glistening and she was dripping wet inside. “Are you ok?” Marianne asked.</p> <p>“Uh huh.” Her expression seemed to show she was really excited. “Is that ok?”</p> <p>“Yes. It’s ok. Elinor is so gorgeous.” Marianne said.</p> <p>“Well, don’t worry about her. I’m not in the least worried.” Elinor said with an honest confidence.</p> <p>Elinor leaned over and kissed Marianne, letting her tongue dance with Marianne’s. Elinor’s hands stroked Marianne's breasts, feeling the flesh beneath her fingers.</p> <p>“You’re so beautiful.” Elinor said as Marianne caressed her lips. “Thank you.”</p> <p>Marianne smiled, kissed Elinor again, and continued to stroke Elinor’s breasts.</p> <p>Marianne turned her head and kissed Elinor. Their lips met. Both women enjoyed the experience. When they finally separated, Marianne said, “I’d love to do it again!”</p> <p>Elinor laughed and said, “Well, if you don’t want to, I’ll give you a handjob.”</p> <p>“No.” Marianne said.</p> <p>Elinor was more experienced, and before she had ever considered having sex with a man she had only seen on porn. However, she had been with a lot of women in her life.</p> <p>Marianne was quite taken by her mother.
