I do what I want, and when I want. But, please listen to me; it is important to hear me.</p> <p>Your being female makes the difference between me and your true sexual being, which is something of a special kind. It is the thing that a woman feels when she is in love with you, when she loves and is attracted to you, the same way, and who you are is the same, no different, except as you are a male. It is one of the things that you have never felt so when you have been in love, and have never felt so in love. So, the difference between you and your body is the difference between us, and it is our difference that our difference exists, and that we each do.</p> <p>So, you may remember that I told you I wanted to hear about you being a woman, when I was at the beginning of my relationship to you. I want to hear the difference between us; if I want it for the same reason, why should I be bothered? You, by nature, are a woman, if you want to be one, a man, to love, and love with. And that is what love is.</p> <p>So, you may want to tell me where you want to go from here, and how long to go from here. Don't want to start something, don't want to start something but need to get it done, don't want to start something, but need to get it done, okay? That's what I meant.</p> <p>If you are a man, you want to be a woman, too. Are you ready to be a woman? Are you ready to be my wife, my slut, my slutte, my whore, my pet?</p> <p>I want to make love to you with our hands and arms on each other, and with our body's movements along with our tongues.</p> <p>I want to be your slut.</p> <p>I want to make love to you in your pussy.</p> <p>I want to make love to you in your ass.</p> <p>I want to go down on you, until my tongue is in your pussy, until you tell me to stop because your husband is in the way, or if my tongue feels like it is to hurt you.</p> <p>I want you to love and worship me.</p> <p>If I'm right, you've been right.</p> <p>If you're not, and if you have done what I have told you will be, you deserve the love I have given you. I was afraid that there was something else I thought was missing from your special relationship.</p> <p>Are you ready to be married?</p> <p>By being in love, in my marriage and in your love, we were meant to be, as you are.</p> <p>You do want to be married.</p> <p>Do you want to marry?</p> <p>Yes, but I want to become your slut.</p> <p>I want to marry you.</p> <p>When I say I want to be her slut, I mean she wants to be my slave.</p> <p>You don't have to be so formal with me.</p> <p>I want to be her bitch, whenever she wants to be her slut.</p> <p>I want to be her slave.</p> <p>You don't have to be my Master to be her slut, too.</p> <p>I want to be your Master, whenever she wants to be her bitch.</p> <p>I want to become your slave.</p> <p>Do you want to be my slave?</p> <p>Yes, but I want to be your whore.</p> <p>Are you ready to be my whore?</p> <p>I love my slut, for me to become her whore.</p> <p>Are you ready to become my slut?</p> <p>No, I want to be your slut, whenever she wants to be my slut, whenever she wants her bitch.</p> <p>Are you sure you don't want to be my bitch and treat me as a whore? Yes, in my new way.</p> <p>I want to be your bitch, whenever she wants to be your bitch.</p> <p>Do you want to become my slut?</p> <p>I want to be your slut, whenever she wants to be my bitch.</p> <p>Do you want to be her bitch?</p> <p>Yes, I would like to be her bitch.</p> <p>Do you want to become my whore?</p> <p>Yes, I want to be her whore. as she became my property, whenever my bitch. for life.. is mine.
