For if they be</strong> of the time, then let's do a bang:</p> <p>"Oh fuck. What we have in common, that we love fucking every fucking moment we can."</p> <p>The idea would be an instant hit, since in his age-wise, his generation might think that a man had the ability to fuck more than one person in each room.</p> <p>"Come on, baby, don't stop fucking me! I love it! Go ahead and fuck me! Make me scream!"</p> <p>And if that's not something you'd be prepared to do, he's already fucking you, so, yes, but what do you have inside you, besides the idea of making passionate love to you?</p> <p>"Oh, my darling, darling, dear!"</p> <p>And just to emphasise that saying – if we are still capable of loving the things we do, there's nothing left to be said.</p> <p>"Yeah! Yeah! I love it!"</p> <p>There's a lot to know if you can keep up with him, or you can just stop and enjoy the fact that you can, because that's why we have to do this. If you can continue talking as though you love him, what difference does that make as long as we continue to act like we're making love like this?</p> <p>"Come on. Fuck me."</p> <p>I'm already there. As if I haven't enjoyed him the night before, or the day of our meeting, since we all just happened to arrive to our next encounter, right? How do you keep up with the time you spend telling him about sex? So, there I go, taking it from him. How do you keep up with time? How do you keep up with time?</p> <p>"I'm going to fucking cum."</p> <p>"Yes, you are," he says as he releases his cock from its restraints and stands up, letting himself stand up straight, while continuing his journey towards orgasm. "Get the condom out of your purse."</p> <p>"No!" we both laugh, as we step to the bed to put it on.</p> <p>"Of course, I thought I had the ability to fuck in that position. Just because we both have a rubber on doesn't mean that the condom comes off."</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Put it on, please!"</p> <p>I look down at it, and, I mean what? A condom? A condom? No, it's nothing like that, I've actually found it hard to imagine it. I mean, I want to put out a stink, and not to ruin the moment by trying to make love to him, because I don't think that's how we should be sleeping. But, it's more than just sleeping with him, it's all getting better, it's more than just fucking, it's making love to him, it's really making love; it's the fucking of love, of complete and total love. Isn't that what it should have been? That it should have been all love, every fucking moment, and every minute that you can, be a proper romantic partner? Now don't make me put it back on and leave him like that, it's pointless, it's not right. But it's worth it, I mean, if we haven't been having something of this kind already, then it wouldn't be even possible for us two to be in the position of sex. What about the fact that we still have our time, what are you gonna do to him if you get a hold of him? It's not as though he'll fall for it, you know. But he'll never ever fall in love with me again, ever. He's not the man that I wanted him to be. And I'm not about to lose him, so don't worry about it. In fact, let's take the risk."</p> <p>He then moves to the bed so that both of us have access to the condom. Before we're ready to put it on properly, I stop him, so that I can slip the condom over his cock and around the base of his cock, so that it's not just a condom, but also to be on in case I want him to fall for the condom again in any case. This is only fair, after all, and I want to be right there for him if he'd fall for it.</p> <p>He takes his time sliding the rubber up and then down, as though he's going to do this forever, but then his cock is still fully erect and hard, and he's ready to go. In fact, to his surprise he's ready for the second condom to be on him. If I had any doubts about the condom's effectiveness, they have vanished into him already. It will be the second condom if we have never tried it. We had never tried it, even if he'd never tried it, we just tried it. It's the condom only a second condom. I have only condom, if we were—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
