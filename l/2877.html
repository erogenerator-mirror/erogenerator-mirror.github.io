A week had passed since my husband had last been to Iraq. His unit had been deployed, and his father (his father) had been killed in an accident, and left me, my husband, and my children alone.</p> <p>A few months ago, I began to wonder if I had ever had what it would be like to be a woman again. I had, by the end of the Army, and I was ready to become one of those women again.</p> <p>I knew I wasn't ready for anything else just yet, with that being the other thing. I knew I was ready for the first time in my life, to be a woman again. But if it was not the right thing for me, what would be the right thing for the future of the United States of America?</p> <p>And where did those of us, in our time as women, become so dependent upon our own bodies, our bodies being one giant sexual tool, for our own ends?</p> <p>The best guess was to return to those days while still young, before the need for children overtook modern civilization, when humanity had lived to a near- extinction, when the need for men's bodies was paramount, now that men existed, the need for women was greater, and now women only sought to satisfy themselves.</p> <p>Not men. Women were in need of men's bodies, of their bodies being the best men, and as they had become more, better, the more, well, all men need their own body parts, their bodies, to perform their duties for, to satisfy their own manhood. It was like the old age of female sexuality, when we, the men and women, found those bodies, those bodies, they enjoyed those bodies, they had taken such pleasure from those bodies.</p> <p>I was ready to be a woman again, ready to give another man who I should know, and in the process, be the woman I knew, was a woman.</p> <p>A woman! I thought, as I took the last steps towards my husband, to give myself to him, to make myself the woman he had always meant for, until his death and my own. Then for him to get his new life, to be a women again.</p> <p>My husband had been waiting to hear his wife's name, to hear hers. He had, he had even considered it, to give a man more, to a woman, and to try to make himself one of the woman in the world, the one he could always count on, the one that he would always remember, until his own days passed. And then to tell me that he loved me, that he could never stop loving me, and for him, until my return, never to be alone again.</p> <p>He looked at me with hope in his eyes, and I smiled back. Then I climbed into his lap, kissed him, whispered, and I said, "I love you, dear husband. I do. I love you. Thank you, dear husband. Thank you."</p> <p>"And thank you, your daughter. Thank you, your wife, and... you," he said as we hugged.</p> <p>"Thank you, sweetie. Thank you so much. I'm gonna... I'm in love with you, with you for real tonight."</p> <p>And our hug got a little more, a little more, and we laughed, kissed, and kissed. The old joke, "You're not bad at this!" was a joke, but I told him that I was no better than many men, no better than most, with which I would never have been able to compete. He said, "God, I love you, too, little lady, you're worth more than some of my soldiers. You're as good as the rest of them too!"</p> <p>We had both drifted from our love, back to our love, back to our life together. I had a better idea than we did to live, for that matter. I hadn't figured, even at that point, that it would matter as much to me, if I, or any of the soldiers, or even the wives or girlfriends, would be able to love them that much, and give them as much love, more than they would ever need. It was just a simple but simple idea, the reason for men getting their own bodies, having so much more to share, more than they would ever have. In my husband.</p> <p>My father, his family included, my life was the one step in our lives was our home, the future, as much more had been ours, so we were our lives, to live, my world, I was ourâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
