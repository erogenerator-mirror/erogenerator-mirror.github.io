They were both in the process of unlocking him before they reached the old and beautiful tree house.</p> <p>The dark brown brick was the only thing that stood for their arrival, save for the two of them, each of the two people. So, they stood on the top of their respective trees. The two trees were large and their faces were at odds with their own, and it was a beautiful sight. There was no space between them and it was, in every detail. Everything was, literally and figuratively, on display.</p> <p>"I wish these were closer," Mary said.</p> <p>"I have a great surprise for you," Stephen said. He was looking at her again with a questioning expression in his eyes. When she turned back, she gave him what he wanted, and with out taking off her panties in the least, she pulled off his shirt and unbuckled his pants. She could feel the heat of his erection against her belly, and she let it rest there for a moment. As he lay there, she slipped off her panties and handed them to him. He didn't hesitate, and in a moment, both were naked and on the verge of entering each other.</p> <p>They embraced, their breath mingling in the humid night air, the leaves of the tree flicking their feet as time stood still. They kissed, and as they moved together, their hands explored each other. Stephen's hands found her ass, and although it was only a foot, it felt like the soft, warm palm of his hand had been resting on her flesh for several seconds. When they broke the kiss, she couldn't believe how much her desire increased when they felt each other's nakedness.</p> <p>Stephen's mouth and fingers teased and played with her nipples, and he did it again, only this time, he teased her nipples with the tip of his tongue. He kissed her belly button, making her giggle.</p> <p>"I've never been on this road before," she said.</p> <p>"There are certain things you've never been on, dear," he replied.</p> <p>"Yes" she said again. "The places my imagination never told me or the places I fantasized about. The places your imagination imagines happening. The places you're not supposed to see."</p> <p>"But if you can imagine any of those places," he went on, "I guess I'd be willing to bet that I could do it. Not to make love to you, but to make love to you. To make love to you. We both do know each other's fantasies about that time," he said.</p> <p>"Oh yes. Those were all, once, yes, but they'll last only until we're married. Now, tell me, and I'll be happy," she teased.</p> <p>"I'd be delighted to tell you," he responded. "I've a thing for your fantasies, too."</p> <p>"The other's not even yours yet," she said.</p> <p>She pulled Stephen to her with her legs on either side of him and lowered herself down on the soft grass. Her body heat radiated through the thin branches while they kissed. Their naked bodies were so close together that their naked skin brushed against each other, and when Stephen reached down and touched her, she felt like she was going to melt inside.</p> <p>Stephen gently pried one of her thighs open, and he gazed at her pussy. It was shaved clean, and it glistened in the nightlight. He leaned down and softly kissed the area between her slit and parted her pussy lips with his tongue. She parted for him and he gently touched her clit with his tongue again.</p> <p>Mary began to moan. "Yeah," she whispered. "Just like that."</p> <p>Stephen's head went back and forth with every touch of his tongue against her clit, and his lips opened just a fraction for him to slide his tongue inside her. One of his thumbs rubbed the underside of her clit while his mouth sucked her pussy flesh into his mouth.</p> <p>His thumb rubbed her clit while he sucked her clit. She was close and so was he. Her body started to shake and tremble. Her breathing got faster and her head was flailing, and she was making little noises of pleasure.</p> <p>"You're going to make me come," she cried.</p> <p>"I want to come," he agreed. God, how he wanted to come. He wished it was all his own. He wanted nothing more. He wanted to come with her and all her little gifts. He wanted to make her come and make her come. If he wanted to love him and all his own her for him so much and be hers for her. She had always. He had that moment. Her forever.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She began to come to come She began to come, he beganâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
