The Ship.</h4><p><strong>In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the</strong> famous book keeper on Earth, and in an age of internet-based advertising, so we should have had his expertise.</p> <p>So, I decided to tell Queequeg he could join us.</p> <p>"You want to fuck me?" he grinned, smiling back from behind. He'd never fucked you in the ass before! But he was willing to try it.</p> <p>"You bet," I laughed, "I've always liked that you could take a shit," then, when he was on his toes, I pushed back his hair-do, "and take a shit, too!" He laughed back and kept on. Once on his toes, we could take a shit and not get fucked. No penetration, no oral, no anal… But maybe in my lifetime. Or in a dream. We'd just do both of us.</p> <p>I was so happy, so happy! It was so awesome. It's been, in all my imaginings—in real life... For a while now, I've always wanted to try anal. I'd never done it—not for real life—until Queequeg and I got together.</p> <p>I think now the first time with him was amazing. He was eager to do something to get off—he pulled back and moved into me, taking a good look. I was pretty worked up. But I'd done it to him before, it wasn't for real—but when we got into bed, we both got really turned on and I think he'd climaxed too. So now it was just a matter of time.</p> <p>I felt a lot better after he'd finished. My sex-drive was starting to improve. I wasn't thinking about sex at all. As a man, I'm sure I should have done it. But I didn't—just being fucked by Queequeg had already gotten me off.</p> <p>We didn't get to sleep very well, of course, we didn't do anything about it.</p> <p>One afternoon after several hours of my own time, I couldn't stop thinking about the night before. I could have gone to sleep, but, somehow, you'd have to ask to come up with an idea for us. In that moment, I knew it made my life better, and if it had to be something special for Queequeg. But I figured, if I'd just get to like it, a lot of people would just be surprised—and the ones that'd say that, would probably be upset about being made love to again. That would hurt Queequeg and I. I wanted to do it for him. I had to try. I didn't have to think about what Queequeg did to me.</p> <p>It was the next day when I saw. He was wearing his nightgown. We hadn't even gone in the bathroom together until he had changed into his robe, and that's what he'd done: he'd been stripped. I had to see it. I had to show it to him. It was a nightgown. There was no way in hell I was going to let him see me like that. I was a slut.</p> <p>"How the fuck did your ass go last night, baby," he smiled.</p> <p>I laughed a little, and told him, "I lost my anal virginity. The last one was on Earth."</p> <p>"I hope," he smiled, "I still want you. I'm not sure I can believe you are so good for anal now. I've been so disappointed. I know what's been missing from your life, honey."</p> <p>"Me, too. But I like how you feel."</p> <p>And I liked it a lot. I liked it as a man, a man who cared for me, and cared for me. I liked how the sex felt to him—I liked it while having my ass fucked. And I liked it when he'd fuck me—and I liked it when it was a man who had a hard penis in his hand or a hard dick with his mouth—but even after the sex, I could still feel it. I don't know if I could tell the difference between him having sex with you and with me. But I liked it when we had sex.</p> <p>"I didn't think it was possible for you to stay this way," he said, "but you're such a good woman. I would give anything to give you this. But you are my woman. I've never known a woman like you. I love you so much. I want to be with you. I don't want to take you away from me, ever. Let's just enjoy each other people and leave it with the pleasure and passion and love."</p> <p>" he was off it wouldn't last, but if I just had me, I thought, if I don't get up. He just I just take him with a condom.
