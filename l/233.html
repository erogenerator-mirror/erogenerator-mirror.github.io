The Monkey-Rope.</h4><p><strong>In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands</strong> are busy, and then again. We might have a job for the time being, or we might not.</p> <p>Of course every person will want some kind of special item that would be important to the crew. The ship we would be leaving on, the one used for making films, one of the best crewmembers known for creating this film, the USS Harry O'Connor, an out-and-out sex symbol who will be famous for having sexy underthings that would be used for porno videos. The main character would have a dozen and more sex toys, a dozen and a half inch round plastic cock shaped to suit her most sensitive areas, the pink mushroom head of a cock for her clitoris, and so on! We should have a great crew of sexy crewmembers who we would love to fuck!</p> <p>I will try to be less dramatic than that. Here, I have you wondering - do I have to tell you about our story here? Because at the bottom of each story, you need to write out a comment and send it here.</p> <p>Our story was a story about a woman, whose sexual desires and desires took control, and who ended things with a single kiss from a man, who she seduced, and used against her. When you send me your story here, do not let that read fantasy in your mind. It will be published in Literotica, and will have sexual elements, but it is not real. The only thing that's real is that fantasy.</p> <p>Let's begin.</p> <p>In early 1973, the crew of the USS Harry O'Connor was assembled outside of New Zealand, in the "Vulcanese" vessel United States Pacific. It was dark, quiet. I had just finished my shift. I was standing by this time, looking out at the sea and enjoying the view. This time of year, the people of New Zealand were in good shape and healthy for a cruise ship. We were headed for the Pacific Ocean on our way to be reunited with our former lives.</p> <p>The ship had been called out for the sea crossing. It wasn't a bad day for sailing though. We had a nice long day sailing the Pacific Ocean, enjoying the view of the sea. We were going to have a nice long cruise on New Zealand, and I told you about it. There was this old boat that had been in the harbor before we arrived just after we arrived at sea. We had made our good fortunes as a unit of the cruise company. We owned this boat as a boat to be used for long holidays during the summer. It was called the "Vulvanese" because it was the first name on the ship of this cruise company. It was now a name for the boat's crew! It was as good and beautiful as the first one had been, except it was not as beautiful as the ship had been, and in spite of having a wonderful crew, it was not as beautiful as the sea. There were only three passengers on board. The Captain and his lady-in-the-boat, the Captain's daughter, were still young men who had just been in the sea. The rest of the crew was younger men. They came alone, their lives as they knew it, just as one of us, my wife and I, needed their company.</p> <p>We were cruising near New Zealand's Pacific Ocean, on the way back to England, and there were only two passengers on board. The Captain had introduced us to his wife-in-the-boat, a young man named "Maggie Smith". This young man had his arm around my wife and his hand on her stomach, and from the way the Captain was looking at us, Maggie might have assumed that it was a joke. Maggie was looking at the Captain and making sure we were all getting along just fine. She looked at one of the other passengers, a young guy named "Jill O'Neil". All this conversation went on for a while.</p> <p>The Captain knew that I was still in the navy and he was enjoying himself. He kept looking into the eyes of my wife as the Captain kept looking at her. For my birthday, she had given me a present. Her birthday present. That night she was wearing a diamond pendant with her name on one of the three small diamonds in the pendant. I was about to give her another present. The Captain told me that I was the last person he wanted to put it on. He got up and walked over to me.</p> <p>"Hey Harry O'Connor," said the Captain, "You're late, don't you think?"</p> <p>"It's my birthday," I replied, smiling.</p> <p>"That's okay," he said, "We're not the only celebrating in England, so it's our first official. Besides, we won't be celebrating in England anyway here in New Zealand with the Navy, it too."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>With a little love forâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
