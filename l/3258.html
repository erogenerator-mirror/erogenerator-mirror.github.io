English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LVII. THE CONVALESCENT.</h4><p><strong>One morning, not long after his return to his cave, Zarathustra sprang up from his couch like a madman, crying with a frightful voice, and acting as if some one</strong> had thrown him down like he'd done so many years ago.</p> <p>"My name is Zarathustra! I am the Zarathustra!"</p> <p>He jumped at the sound of the voice he heard the very first time he entered his cave. His eyes flicked over his surroundings to the two woman in front of him. A smile twinkled on his face as he realized that he would always be the father of one of these, one of many who would come visit.</p> <p>One look at one of the women in the back of the shop and he laughed with his self.</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"My cousin Zor, she's your cousin! So who are you, anyway? How did you escape when you were at the monastery?"</p> <p>The words hit him like a punch to the stomach.</p> <p>"Where are you goin' to go?"</p> <p>"To the monastery myself, I guess."</p> <p>"Well, get lost and then go fuck yourself!"</p> <p>"I'll see you later!"</p> <p>"Don't make me wait! I wanna fuck you!"</p> <p>"Fuck you in your bed!"</p> <p>A quick look back confirmed their meeting. The way she dressed had left little to imagination. She had nothing on under her loose fitting robes. The way she walked gave him flashes of her shapely legs and her bare breasts that swayed hypnotically as she walked. When she bent down to pick up something out of the pile of laundry, he was treated to a close up view of her tight ass and legs before she stood up.</p> <p>"Bend over and I'll take you!"</p> <p>When she turned around, he knew her eyes were sparkling and her hair hung down to her belly. With each step, her backside moved with a mesmerizing sensual rhythm, a show of sensual perfection he had watched all his life on the television.</p> <p>"Bend over!"</p> <p>He knew that he had to do it, but he had no idea why it was happening. It seemed so weird that a woman was saying dirty things under the shower and not telling him the truth.</p> <p>So he went after Zarathustra with a fury! She was so beautiful when she came. He just couldn't understand him. Zarathustra had a big heart and a huge body. Maybe she hadn't gotten pregnant.</p> <p>When she bent to pick up some dry clothes, he saw her nipples poke into the shirt opening even more than normal. She must be on her back now too. A wave of jealousy swept over him when he saw this.</p> <p>"Bend over!"</p> <p>He got closer and closer until he bumped fists against her ass.</p> <p>"Bend over!"</p> <p>"Bend over! I'm coming in!"</p> <p>The idea of doing this to the woman in front of him was a bit unnerving, but he tried to ignore it. The whole town was watching him and he was sure it wouldn't be long to find a young couple and have them in the same room. They might come and look for a bit longer. He had to play along if he was going to fuck someone.</p> <p>She wasn't wearing anything under her robe, so the way her backside moved left him staring at her body like a hungry dog. He could feel his cock growing by the second. One of the people he knew that had sex with her had to stand on the top shelf of several racks next to the toilet to get their clothes dry. He had never seen a woman doing it in the flesh.</p> <p>"Open up!"</p> <p>She turned around and they started kissing. It was a hot kiss, one full of passion, with passion and passion like his own. When she pulled her lips back, he saw her glistening with the water and some white liquid left in the corner of her mouth just enough to reveal the color. For a second, he saw her look over to him and he smiled sheepishly. She was naked too, and he couldn't resist a quick glance between their bodies. When she turned to face him again, all he saw was some red hair covering the other girl's pussy hair while she had a face between both of her legs. He saw a large pair of breasts and a thin, thin line on the sides of her body that led to her dark nipples. She hadn't pulled them out of the water yet but he imagined that she must be a full cup full.</p> <p>"Bend over..."</p> <p>He was still trying to get control of the situation but she put her hands on his head and began to guide his face towards her pussy. When he felt her thighs touch his face, it caused his mind to lose focus. His tongue twitched away in shock. Zarath to the whole place in the girl. The feeling out of the pussy. When her hands on her breasts, he felt her legs and herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
