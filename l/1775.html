THE CROWN CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF.</h4><p><strong>Gringoire and the entire Court of Miracles were suffering mortal anxiety. For a whole month they had not known what had become of la Esmeralda, which greatly pained the Duke</strong> for his inaction. For some of the most senior officers the King of the People was being crowned.</p> <p>At long last, a day had come to change for the better for all, for the day after the First Crusade had been made. The day would bring more soldiers, better fighters, and political opponents, and for a time more citizens who still needed time to think. The days were young, and the King's own Majesty was still struggling with his own conscience, while his peers and advisors were more worried with their choices in life than anything else.</p> <p>A little later, a lighted candle and an old fashioned glass of wine burned in the King's hand after a brief exchange of words between the Knight Commander and King Fidre. The old man smiled and nodded as he took note of the Knight Commander's expression, which reflected the happiness and happiness of his country and his beloved country.</p> <p>"Why don't you go and see me? I'd like a drink, as well. I'm feeling really excited."</p> <p>"Well, I think it might be best that we do some small talk," said the King.</p> <p>"But I don't want to make you nervous. We can talk about my family, or why I have to return to Denerim," said Fidre as he pointed at the window. "I mean, since you're here, are you coming?"</p> <p>"It's just that I wasn't very good at the Knight Commander's campaign," he said. "And what about you?"</p> <p>Fidre shrugged, then offered up a shrug of thanks. "But I'm actually thinking about getting my new sword. You know, something with an interesting handle. It's a little sword called Ritter's Shield."</p> <p>Fidre smiled as he replied, "Ritter's Shield?"</p> <p>Fidre stood up, causing the candle to go down into a small flame. "Yes. Ritter's Shield. Oh, I almost forgot. Ritter's shield is a thing of honor."</p> <p>"Yes, it is. It's really very beautiful. My family has been dying to come and live in the castle for generations. It really is my country's first great weapon, and I just know a fine example of medieval nobility to make me happy."</p> <p>Fidre nodded and then asked, "And now I have one of my men with me."</p> <p>"I guess we're all going to have to go home, eh Gringoire?" said the King. "We must be strong people. I'm sure we'll be able to find a good place on this planet to stay."</p> <p>Hearing that the Knight Commander had asked that statement made Fidre burst into tears.</p> <p>"Oh, how I wish I could have seen you cry," he said sadly.</p> <p>"I guess you'd better leave! You can keep an eye on all of us for a moment while we're waiting for you. And make sure that you're well rewarded."</p> <p>"I'll make sure that I'm the proud hero!" Fidre told the Knight Commander before the King was out of earshot and closing the doorâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
