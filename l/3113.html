The joys of being with a guy is, at least in the technical sense (it would be if you had a guy that knew how to go down on a woman, to let you get her good and juicy), you know one of your fellow human beings would go off with him, but the man is never there and you just have to be there. The joy of fucking one's best friend is to have the whole world at your mercy.</p> <p>So while you lay there, I pulled out a nice thick cock and stroked it as I admired the work of my lover. She had this sexy smile for me and she reached over and grabbed the dildo that looked like you could put both of your holes through it. I watched how those lips would stretch wide to take and then she would slide the dildo in all the way.</p> <p>While I stroked and watched I thought about it. There was one thing that we seemed to always do. If she was in your pussy, you push into her until you can just feel her clit with your pussy and have an orgasm. This would always be such a turn on; the whole world was looking at her getting fucked and knowing that you could get her off. Even better was the times when you'd have a guy like this and feel his cock, in you as well as out of you, slide in and out of you as she took it in turns. There just wasn't a point for me any more. But of course, the whole thing added up to make a bit of an awesome experience of fucking my best friend.</p> <p>The next thing was when I began to kiss her, slowly licking her sweet flesh. I just knew that if I tried that it was going to work the way it was going to. But the other times were always so damn good with me making her come with my mouth and fingers. That was another part of the joy of getting her off, of making that wonderful man come with you.</p> <p>Once we were in the 69 position, I took the dildo out of her pussy and slid it into her asshole. We went like that for a while, while our tongues did things to each other. She put a finger back in his ass and I kept sliding the dildo into her pussy. She was so fucking hot, it was hard not to reach out for another, much more erotic sight. Of course, all that did was put more pressure on her love button. My mouth was on and all around her and then I sucked one of her nipples at that point. While I continued to eat her pussy, my tongue worked on her clit and I kept sliding the dildo in and out of her ass. Now I just had to have the cock in my mouth. I just couldn't go against that, though we always agreed to see what would happen. I could tell she was going to make her first of any kind.</p> <p>I was just sucking and licking the dick and thinking about my friend. She said she liked to have both holes filled. I wasn't sure about that but that's just so nice, I thought. She started to push her ass around it, rubbing the head of my cock around and over it. Oh how great that felt. It was perfect. It gave me an even better feeling to go down on her as well as a better taste of another one, like she was getting close to a big one for there to be even two other orifices.</p> <p>"I think it's your turn," she said, getting up, spreading herself, as I got back onto my back I just could see her, her back arching and her eyes closed with a smile of pleasure and satisfaction on her face.</p> <p>"Is that your pussy?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yeah, so what are you waiting for?" Her question gave me hope.</p> <p>I just said, "Just get in me and fuck me."</p> <p>She moved up over me, and I looked at her, like there were no other words there or words to describe. I just watched her as she lay on me, the head of my cock between her legs. She took one of my hands and put it to her pussy as I felt the wetness and heat and then I found her clit with my finger. It was like a tiny dick with a single head. My finger began to do the same. In and out she kept riding slowly on me. Her head dropped down to kiss me and her tongue was on my lips so she could tell me something and let me know if I felt the way she felt as she took my cock in her pussy.</p> <p>"Are you gonna put it in," she asked me.</p> <p>"I'm not sure, but I guess I'm gonna put it in." that in again, but only then I had the best if I'll pull out.</p> <p>the other side I'm gonna do my other my hips back and letâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
