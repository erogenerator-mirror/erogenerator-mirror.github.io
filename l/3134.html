There, to the east, south, north, and west, it shines as brightly as if the Amida’s Paradise</strong> has never shone red in the year, because at least there are several suns, a sun that has to shine brighter than that.</p> <p>I stood up and took a sip of the chilled champagne. I stood there, looking at the sky from under my arm as if it is one of those things that you know is absolutely fascinating yet feels so uninteresting; a sun that shines brighter from above, bright as well as mysterious and mysterious, like some mysterious creature who takes the sun off its path, while looking at it as if it is a great, long-gone beast. The feeling of the sun in the eye of the sun, like a magical wind that's never stopped, was so alien.</p> <p>With a start, there was a flash from the distance, but there was no one else there. I turned my head back toward the lake, still in the twilight zone of my mind, but I had forgotten about my evening, and it had all been one huge mistake. There was no other way to go tonight.</p> <p>I put my glass down and picked up my brush, then sat down to put the brushes in the bucket. I put the towel down and picked up the bottle of Chardonnay and poured some out into the glass. I started to take my handkerchief with me to rub into the sun's rays. I sat there staring up at the trees and bushes, trying to remember how we'd been so isolated from the world. I just had to look down my throat.</p> <p>It was almost ten o'clock. I stood up, and took a deep breath. I grabbed the bottle of Chardonnay, and took a big gulp of the cold liquid. I couldn't bear the saltier taste of the Chardonnay as it went down my throat, but I couldn't wait to be in the hot tub, with the moon shining bright over my shoulders, and the sun shining down upon me.</p> <p>What the hell has gotten into me?</p> <p>As I'm standing up, I realize I need to pee. I turn around to my right and begin to walk toward the water. I grab the hem of my shirt and slowly pull it up, to the point that I'm afraid my shirt will catch underneath it. I pause and reach behind me to untie the strap. I pull out the shirt, and slowly turn around, exposing my hairless chest and neck. I pick up the bottle of Chardonnay, and set it down. I throw it at my pants pocket, and slowly push them down, and let the shirt do the same to the pants and pants. It lands somewhere in the middle. I look down at my chest, and notice that my nipples are still standing up, and they almost seem to be sticking out through the thin fabric. I take my handkerchief out of my pocket and put it to my mouth, breathing deeply for a moment and then letting it drop. I stand up with a sigh. I lean back against the stone. My hard nipples, pointing into the night air, are begging to be sucked. I run my hands though my hair. It's still a wet mess. I don't care. My clit is still tingling.</p> <p>I lay down on my blanket, resting my head against the stone. I turn on my side and look at the stars for a while before drifting slowly, with my head pressed against the stones. I let out a long, slow moan as my body tenses up in response to my touch. I slowly remove my hands from my hair and put them on my chest again. I rub the lotion across the top of my breasts, making them tingle in response to some sort of contact, and I watch them shake as I work the lotion in. Eventually I slide my hands over my stomach to my pubic mound, and let a thin, slow finger slide between the hairless lips of my pussy, making them feel moist and slippery as my finger strokes. I lay back, and my hands fall in to the moon's light, touching myself. I run my finger tips across my clitoris, and as my finger circles it, I moan.</p> <p>The sensation is so intense, it's a pleasure from my lower body. I let my finger slide all the way over my clitoris, and it begins to move faster. My fingertip makes light circles all around my clit. The sensation just keeps building, my juices flowing fast and slick. I start to make little sounds in my mouth as my finger works in and out of my sex. A second finger, the same finger that slides in and out of me, slips into my love canal as I press against the roof of my sex. My hips begin to thrust up into their own, and up into the water as my breasts. I feel the waves build. I feel the warmth of the Sun, the sun. My finger deep inside of my legs is moving as I feel the sun I feel the sun—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
