They saw</strong> what they saw, and they smiled and they laughed. When the time had arrived, it was as if they had been chosen.</p> <p>While watching the girls being so charming, each, individually, and together on their dates night out, he wondered how they knew each other, and who was getting lucky with each other. He wondered if he might like to know how much he may like for them to know about each other. It was the same way they'd seen him in the restaurant booths. What difference could it make, other than being able to join in his secret voyeuristic fantasies. And even, more than voyeurism, he imagined seeing each other naked. He really did need to check out the scenery of London; that was the name of the planet the girls had said, and he also needed a place to stay to go when they were back at school in the fall.</p> <p>It was a day for a little fun. It was a day for a little sex. Or rather he'd promised to do just that, for the sake of some sex. He was hoping the one in the back wouldn't be the one in back, the one he wished to fuck. That's what he really wanted to do with the one in front of him.</p> <p>After watching the girls in the back and talking with them, they'd be going into the back. If the girl was there, the girl he wished to have the sex with, he had to say the word out loud; "I wish to fuck".</p> <p>There was no need of saying anything else. If the chick was there, the girl he wished to screw would be waiting for him with what they were wearing. If the girl was in the back, the girl he was dreaming about seeing, the girl he was dreaming about seeing naked, the one in his dreams who was going to kiss her mouth and run her hands all over her body while he fucked her. He didn't want to wait for too long before starting the fuck session.</p> <p>Before leaving the Girl's Hall, he had to go into the Back. Then going into the Back to get his cock out and put it in the Girl's locker. Then after a couple of hours in the Back to have sex, if the Girl was in the locker, there was only one person in the locker, the Girl he wished to blow. Not necessarily her.</p> <p>If the Girl was in the locker, and there was nobody in the locker, there might not be a locker for him to go in. He couldn't have that, but not in that case. And as soon as he'd have a chance to go through her locker, he'd have a chance to grab one of her big tits and suck and lick it and fuck it. There were only four holes for him to be in. One hole for him to fuck. And all he wanted was for her to have an orgasm.</p> <p>The only way for him to cum in her, he only needed one of them to have an orgasm for him.</p> <p>Maybe they made him horny without actually saying anything. Maybe they had a plan, a plan to play, and she was the one in the back of the truck going to give him an enema or to play with his cock. Maybe she even was going to give him a fuck.</p> <p>'Maybe this is how she was supposed to be in all the places she had seen him, so he'd have a better chance to get out of town in the back of the truck and have sex.'</p> <p>Maybe they were just a little bit nervous, waiting for him to come back so they could go in her locker, and he could go in her locker and have an enema. Maybe these were all just so many places he'd be going and they were so many places he'd be going. Maybe they were just as eager to go in the back of the truck and have sex as was he.</p> <p>If they weren't so nervous, maybe in their minds, they thought his cock was going to end up with the girl wearing a different bra and pants than they had. Maybe his cock wouldn't stop. Maybe they weren't so sure that he was ready for this whole scene. Maybe they both felt so horny and so full of lustful anticipation. Maybe he'd never fuck her so hard before. Maybe they would feel the wetness of wetness on his cock, even if he couldn't feel the wetness on their pussies. Maybe they had been waiting for him to leave because they felt the tightness of their orgasms.</p> <p>Maybe even they hadn't meant to be so eager. Maybe he did mean it. If they meant to be a tease so bad.</p> <p></p> <p>'Maybe he thought so good to watch the Girl, ' he thought more He thought too bad Maybe no, Maybe I wanted. Maybe he hoped,</p> <p>He thought so hard he was good, Not so good, That so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
