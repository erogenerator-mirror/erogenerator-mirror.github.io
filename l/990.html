She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette had taken their departure, Thénardier</strong> had made no secret about her having found an extra condom when Cosette had insisted on having a threesome. It had been a long time since she had felt turned on by a man. Even so, having a threesome with her had sparked her libido in another direction. It always had. There had never been anyone else like her and certainly not a new partner, but Cosette. With a sense of regret, she reluctantly accepted the offer as she had known the moment she had made the decision. "Do it!" she had once said to her husband. Now, lying next to him between his legs, Thénard took his chance.</p> <p>They kissed, their tongues swirling in each other's mouths. His hands roved over Thèsséstèès body; his lips sucked on hers, their tongues danced. He pulled Thèsséstès pants back up, and she kicked them off of her body. Her fingers stroked his cock. It was longer and thicker than her husband's. She couldn't resist. She wanted him inside her. Cosette's body was unlike anything she had ever felt. Her small nipples rubbed against his chest whenever she moved to reach down into the cleft of his ass, or to his balls when he pushed back to fuck her. Cosette was too good to resist.</p> <p>Her husband had loved this. Her body was pure. He pushed her against the table after they had cum. "You feel wonderful," he gasped. She wanted more of him. Her pussy had never felt so completely satisfied.</p> <p>Théstèè lifted back up, and when he thrust his dick deep inside her, she shuddered. His cum filled the condom, making her want to cry. She pulled back to try and catch another one. Her pussy was still a little sore. Cosette had always been the aggressor in bed, but now she wanted more. Her pussy was still alive with desire. Her eyes closed as she felt his dick inside her. She could feel her juices running out of her pussy, down onto his dick. He fucked her hard, thrusting his cock forward into her. "Fuck me, Cosette," she whispered.</p> <p>His body felt incredible. Her body was alive with an urgent need to feel what happened to her. She wanted it to continue. She felt the urgency of the man that she had just been with. She opened her eyes and peered at him over her shoulder while he fucked her. He was watching her, mesmerized. Her face was alive. His gaze moved down to her breasts, then upward and to her eyes.</p> <p>"You are incredible," the Frenchman said at last. Then, to her husband. "She has such a beautiful body." She wanted to continue where they had left off the last time they had been together. Her husband's hands had found their way again to her breasts, touching, rubbing until she was moaning, gasping, and wriggling beneath him. He was moving her body in an up and down movement, and it felt incredible. "This feels so good," Cosette murmured as he continued to fuck her. Her lover looked at her with love, desire, and pleasure in his eyes. He had a wonderful manly quality. She thought about that for a minute or two and realized that she couldn't hold back, and wanted to watch him fuck her until her body took control of her. As she looked into those eyes, it was clear that he saw it in hers.</p> <p>They had already made love, and she loved that. However, their first time, just minutes before, had been spectacular. The passion of fucking seemed distant with almost infinite speed. It had been a new experience for both of them. It hadn't seemed as enjoyable as just fucking, but he was doing his best to show her how he really felt, even when she was the one feeling guilty about liking other people. He was doing his best to show her that it wasn't all that bad. He was doing his best to show her how he really felt. Thèssèsssssssss! She thought again, and shook her head. It seemed so different than it did whenever they had had sex. They could share their intimacy. She saw it differently. If she had her husband's cock inside of her, she would want him more. It didn't seem like a fair fight with him to claim Thèssè while she had been so helpless. If Cosette had her lover's dick inside of her, he would take her with it, and take her fully tonight.</p> <p>Thèssès gasped when her pussy suddenly tightened around her husband's cock. Cosette's had always had felt pleasure, but that had never felt, when he was like this had come inside of its intensity. Cosette's first feeling of pleasure. Pletto knew she became nothing, the pleasure. She felt her husband's husband had never felt it so strong.
