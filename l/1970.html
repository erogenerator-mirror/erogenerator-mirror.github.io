To them that are sick of the jaundice, honey seems bitter; and to</h4><p><strong>them that are bitten by a mad dog, the water terrible; and to children, a little ball seems a fine thing. And why then should I be angry? or do</strong> what is best for them, the children.</p> <p>I didn't tell you about his wife, because she always makes it hard for me to see her. I can't help but imagine what her name would be like, what she could be like, her body even soft. I wonder if she would think about her husband at night while she is sleeping, wishing her husband was here and having a nice hard fuck. And then there is that woman that I am having an incredible conversation with. She is not a nice one any more.</p> <p>It is with my wife and she loves her husband so much. She never misses what happens in her bed, her husband knows that. She never thinks that her husband can satisfy her without giving her time or time to prepare. The first time we went through a sexual fantasy session, it was all he could do to hold on to me while my wife came all over the carpet. I was so lost when it happened, but now that it is done, it is something I will never forget. I can't say that I was the first man to have that fantasy.</p> <p>Anyway, the way to get to a man, well, let's just say, to make a woman more interesting. I don't know about you, but I am definitely getting ahead of my fellow man, for the time being.</p> <p>***</p> <p>My wife and I were in the hot tub, relaxing by the heated pool, drinking the cool waters of the water we are in. I had my hand between her legs, trying to find out if she was asleep. After several minutes, I slipped down below the water, trying to take in the scene.</p> <p>I was wearing a loose shirt, very worn, with one button unbuttoned. Normally you don't see any women in hot tubs with one of their nipples being pebbled while they are underwater. I was in a nice bikini top, not a suit much to hold onto and my nipples seemed to be swelling.</p> <p>Then it happened. My wife looked up in time with the water and found my outstretched hand between the water and her pussy. It wasn't long before she was fully awake. I continued to rub her, trying to find out if she was breathing.</p> <p>"A little cold," she said, "did you forget to take off your top?"</p> <p>She had put it on the bottom of the tub and it covered her, covering nothing anymore. I asked her if she felt cold. she said she did. It seemed a little awkward having my hand between her legs, so I reached down under the water and ran my hand over her boobs. We both liked the feel of it.</p> <p>"You are so sexy," I whispered in her ear while my hand started to feel its way around her upper body, and I was starting to wonder if she heard me.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she said with a small sigh.</p> <p>"Can you feel how hard I am?" I asked.</p> <p>"Mmmmm yes."</p> <p>"I have an idea."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"Here, let's see if you can make me cum, shall we?"</p> <p>I knew that I wasn't going to last long. My wife was a pro at getting me off at just the right time. I knew she would do it just right and I wanted to make sure that she did it right.</p> <p>"Mmmm, yes," I moaned as my cock started to grow again, "I can make you cum, just by making you watch me."</p> <p>"Mmmm, no, not tonight," my wife said, "Tonight I am going to make you cum by feeling like you are going to cum by my pussy."</p> <p>"Yes," I said, "I will do that."</p> <p>I reached under the water and found her clit, so swollen it was hard to even focus on her words.</p> <p>"Just relax," she said.</p> <p>I lifted her leg, put my hand under it, trying to find the spot where her clit is, but I couldn't get over the whole way. She was so beautiful. I put my other hand on her chest, rubbing and caressing and enjoying the feel of her body, all of that was so sensuous and hot, so sexual.</p> <p>"Are you ready for the next step?" I asked, but I didn't get the chance to say a word.</p> <p>I had a big hard erection, and I wanted to make it. "I have never cum like this before, it feels like it is at the end."</p> <p>"You have never had a nice, hard, hot, pussy in your hands," she said. "I am going to do that too. Just relax down there."</p> <p>She said that she was already in the first thing they had me in her hands, she had something in motioned in, she had already a gripâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
