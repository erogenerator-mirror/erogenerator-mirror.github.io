English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LX. The Seven Seals.</h4><p><strong>This is a final paean which Zarathustra sings to Eternity and the marriage-ring of rings, the ring of the Eternal Recurrence. ...</strong></p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>"The sun's just starting to come up," Sarah greeted Sarah as she opened the front door of her bedroom to her late husband.</p> <p>"We have to go into town in a couple of days, dear husband," Sarah smiled as she led the young man into the room. "Come on, I've got a special treat for you," Sarah smiled as she removed the robe from him, and he stared at her body with the same lustful eyes as he had the first time he saw her.</p> <p>As Sarah closed the bedroom door behind her, she looked at him with a devilish grin and then turned around to kiss him. "Oh my, that's so good, dear!" Sarah said as she stepped back from the young man.</p> <p>He grinned at Sarah's body and he couldn't believe what they were doing, as he stood behind Sarah, his hands on her upper arms, his cock firmly pressed against her lower back. She moaned softly as she pressed back against his cock, letting her head fall back, her mouth parted slightly, waiting to be kissed again. Sarah pulled her face away from him and gazed down at him.</p> <p>"I think we'd better get you out of these clothes, handsome!" Sarah grinned.</p> <p>"I have an idea, Sarah," Jason replied, as his hands trailed down Sarah's body from her hips.</p> <p>"Why don't you do it yourself, handsome?" Sarah giggled, and then moved down the couch.</p> <p>Jason smiled as he moved behind his horny wife. Her skin was smooth and tan, with just a hint of green as it was exposed on her shoulder blades. Her hair looked like a beautiful braid, or a silken braid, that fell well past her shoulders. Jason pulled a pair of pants from his pocket and then quickly stripped.</p> <p>Sarah quickly sat down on the arm of the couch, and he continued his exploration of every inch of her body that he could. Sarah had one leg dangling off the arm rest so he could place kisses all around and then around her navel. He moved lower and then he licked Sarah's navel, sucking on it softly, as he went lower. He felt the soft skin of Sarah's abdomen as he ran his tongue and lips all over it, and kissed her lower belly down to her pelvis.</p> <p>Sarah sighed softly and then she whispered, "I've always wanted you to kiss me there," and Jason smiled and then placed kisses on the tops of Sarah's thighs, and then he kissed upward and inward from her thighs to the tops of her thighs, as he kissed first her right thigh, then her left thigh. Sarah continued to talk and Jason kissed her from her knee to her hip, where he kissed the insides of her sexy thighs a few times, and Sarah moaned softly.</p> <p>Sarah sat up on the sofa, and Jason quickly undressed. Sarah lay back on the sofa and said, "You can't get me any harder, gorgeous!" Jason smiled at her and continued his kisses on her body, moving in close, kissing every inch of her body he could. Sarah sighed softly, and then she pulled Jason close and held him.</p> <p>"I've never felt this close to a man before, Jason," Sarah giggled softly.</p> <p>"That I am!" Jason smiled widely at Sarah.</p> <p>Sarah closed her eyes and then Jason kissed her passionately, as Jason's hands massaged Sarah's body from neck to toes. Jason spent a few minutes alternating with kissing and licking her breasts with the tips of his fingers and Sarah sighed loudly. Jason smiled broadly from Sarah's nipples as he felt their hardness as he ran his tongue round them, and Sarah moaned, "Aaaahhh!"</p> <p>Jason then kissed Sarah's navel, as he pushed and caressed each side of Sarah's body and then he kissed her upper hips to the top of her thighs and then he kissed downward, over Sarah's sex, and down Sarah's thigh to her knees. Jason kissed the inside of Sarah's thighs, and she sighed happily as Jason kissed the inner thighs of her thighs, and then he kissed downward again to Sarah's pussy. Jason continued his kisses and then Sarah sighed, "Mmmmmm" as Jason finally brought his head down to her sex and kissed her inner lips. Sarah groaned softly as Jason's tongue traced over her labia, and Sarah sighed. Jason then pulled away from Sarah, and then he moved behind Sarah and kissed her gently on her lips again.</p> <p>"You're beautiful, sweetheart!" Jason said as Sarah smiled in return.</p> <p>"And you're gorgeous, too, too, darling," Sarah replied Sarah," was Jason replied Sarah replied Sarah</p> <p></p> <p>"And I'm pretty, sweet-boy," Sarah replied Jason," was Jason said Jason replied Sarahâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
