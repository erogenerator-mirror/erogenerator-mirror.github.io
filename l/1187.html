These two</strong> places are set to coincide with the events in their time.</p> <p>Chapter 1</p> <p>The chronological order of my stories is as follows:</p> <p>Todd & Todd, Preems by J.R. Pantie Todd and Toddie by J.R. Pantie</p> <p></p> <p>Part 1</p> <p>Todd was a little slow to respond. I figured he had a hard time figuring out why I had a cock, but I got a glimpse when he reached out and started stroking it. That didn't stop my hands. They started at where his cock was, and moved right up to his belly. I reached further, grabbed his cock in the palm of my hand, and continued stroking him, getting him really hard. I could feel his cock pulse against my hand.</p> <p>I knew that he liked it when I touched him, and kept on. As he got harder, I reached down and squeezed his cock and started rubbing him.</p> <p>"Do you want to cum with me?"</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes."</p> <p>I looked at him for a second. "Do you want to rub your hard on?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" And I started rubbing him again. I didn't want to make him cum but if that worked for him, that's all that I wanted. There would be plenty of time for that.</p> <p>"Good," I said. "Now, let go of me. I have some other things to do."</p> <p>"I want to cum with you," Todd said.</p> <p>In another time, I might have been surprised when Todd said that but I was glad to hear him say it. Our lives are different now. I love him and would do anything for him if I could. I was in love with him, which was obvious. We were getting along so well that we hadn't known that we weren't meant to be together until the time we became engaged.</p> <p>"That's for me, not for you," Todd said. "I just want to cum with you. Let me do this."</p> <p>As Todd reached out and put his hand in front of his erection, I leaned my head down, grabbed his balls, and stroked him as he stood there in front of me. The touch was electric, and really turned me on. I rubbed myself harder and harder. I felt my body flush with heat. I wanted him to cum now, and I wanted him to cum, too. When he didn't say anything, I leaned back and started rubbing Todd's balls again.</p> <p>My fingers were shaking so hard that I could feel it all over my body. I felt so much better from just rubbing him, and that wasn't all because Todd was in front of me. It was because I was in charge. A part of me is in charge, and if my power to control a man is to be found by someone, then how do I make a man obey my every command?</p> <p>The more I rubbed, the hotter I got. My head lolled back on the couch as I started to cum. I heard him catch his breath. I could feel his cock throbbing against me, and it just seemed like it might burst. His cock exploded. I mean, how am I supposed to get a man to cum? There aren't that many times I can stroke him like that, much less give him orgasms that would be so intense that they would make his life a living nightmare.</p> <p>What would that have meant to me if I had asked him to shoot his cum straight into my hand or face? What would it have done to me if I had let him cum into my mouth? My mind and body couldn't have been more complete if I would have allowed him to shoot his cum straight into my mouth so that I would have tasted him, rather than the taste of him, even if he had shot his cum straight into my mouth, rather than the taste of him.</p> <p>All of these things that were so important to me when I lived my life, I don't need another person's cum on my face. It would be like a third person's cum on my body. My body would feel the touch of all their juices, and all of their cum, and all the rest of it. I could feel Todd's cock as he came all over my hand and some right in my palm.</p> <p>I rubbed Todd's cock hard and fast. The skin of his cock was so smooth and plump. I rubbed his cock furiously and fast when he was done coming, and when he would calm down, and then get up and go over to me.</p> <p>He always told me to rub my hands on my face, when I mean it, and was so smooth and and my body touched my face, and, not the same with his cum as I could feel it.. it if I feel every time it all on my body. a person on my body...
