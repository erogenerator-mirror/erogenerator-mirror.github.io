The diocese of D—— is a fatiguing one. There are very few plains and</strong> mountains for a catholic clergyman to attend a service. I, myself, was the last one there to attend that service though we were not officially ordained. I am happy to say I am not. The church has no problems with us attending our services, and I had the privilege of being a vicar for several years. After the service was complete and in full celebration of the service in the D——, the vicar ordered me to go with him to the vicar's office. I was the only one there in uniform and I was assigned to attend there because the vicar had given me the letter that we would need to attend the church services. After an hour of listening to him lecture me on how the church services are to be conducted, I walked outside and got into the carriage with him. We were very friendly to each other and enjoyed the conversation while we drove to the office. I think we both enjoyed the company of being outside in the back seat of the carriage. I can’t tell you how long we sat there talking and sharing our stories about our lives. When I left him parking lot he kissed me and said he was so happy that we could stay the next night. I am very happy to say that our conversation ended and I kissed him on the cheek too. It will be a very pleasant reunion in our memory.</p> <p>After that I had not had a chance to change out of my uniform. I had not told anyone about my attire. I have already put my tunic back on under normal circumstances. I am hoping to be done wearing it tonight. At five-thirty, I walked around the church and made a point to meet with the vicar. I had no idea how long we would be at the church because there have been no public meetings.</p> <p>It was late and the vicar asked me to come to him. He told me to take a walk around the building and be sure to walk with him. I am a bit afraid that what is going on will be a bit too public. While we walked together, he asked me if I knew what was going to take place in the next few minutes and I told him. We continued walking for about ten minutes and I thought he was going to ask me if I would come or not. We ended up walking several blocks and soon we reached a place where he had a bedroom and his own bathroom. He said that he was glad I would come down, since I was just wearing a skirt and his uniform had not allowed for me to get undressed.</p> <p>He said it was obvious we had some issues in common, like being able to perform the service in a uniform, since we both had the same cloths, but that we had different things in common. He asked me to kiss him. I did not hesitate at all. We continued walking toward his room. We stopped at a window and he asked me to kneel down and he had a towel wrapped around the waist and told me to place my hands in the towel and then to sit down.</p> <p>As soon as we were about to get into the bedroom, we both heard a knock on the door. It was not the first time that he has visited the house. This morning we went back several times to get my laundry and I think he was wondering where the towel was.</p> <p>He said it was necessary to talk to me because he was wondering how many times we would have to get to each other. He said that I told him about the service, so he said that we could talk while he put his suit on.</p> <p>A few minutes later, we came out into the hallway and I asked him where he got the towel. He said that one of the priests at the church said that he got a towel wrapped around his waist. I said that it could be the same thing that I told you that day. He said he did that because he found the opportunity to wear something as sexy as a nun. In truth, we both knew it was the same thing and that we should just talk about it.</p> <p>I had changed into a skirt and a blouse instead, which I had already put on. It was a pretty thing with little buttons on each side that were not tied up. It was a nice blouse and I think it would go very nicely with my skirt and blouse. I was wearing stockings and I was glad to see that I did not bother to put panties on. The skirt was short enough to cover me from my legs up and just barely covered my bottom when I came down. I had not even put on high heels.</p> <p>The vicar was just standing there looking at me and I could feel his eyes burning through me, and I am sure that I could feel his eyes on my legs. I was doing the heat too. I kept thinking the next thing I need I decided to go into the broom shed and took off my skirt and to leave just the stockings under the blouse—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
