For "The Words of the Preacher, the Son of David,</strong> the Son of the Lord", I would've liked to have found a new book that might be appropriate. Perhaps something to do with the letters and titles and not fall into the hands of the people who wrote the Holy Book, the Lord of Knowledge. It was in the second part of the sentence of "This Book", where in the first part I had said that I would like to teach you the errors of the Bible.</p> <p>I began to notice movement in the bed area just as the woman that had caught our eye undressed and walked towards my room. Her hips moved back and forth, as she pulled off those sexy little blouses and found her bra. It was obvious that she had found them as she pulled off the last one of her clothes, and her hands found their way to her tits. She fondled themselves and squeezed her pussy as she pulled her panties off. Her hands moved back to her breasts as she continued teasing her pussy with long, slow strokes. For the first time since I had first seen her she was not a virgin.</p> <p>"Ahh yes!" She said as she leaned in closer, her hands coming back to her sex, fingers flittering over her clit as her body pushed forward. "Just like that! Ohh" She moaned as her fingers found her cunt and started playing with herself as she masturbated. Her eyes were closed as she slowly slid two of her fingers inside herself and then added a third to her dripping mess.</p> <p>"I think I'm about to come!" I said as I pulled my cock from my boxers, freeing it from its cloth prison.</p> <p>"Yes!" She said as she stroked her hand up and down her pussy. Her hips moved a little as she was going over the top. Her fingers were still working her clit as her breasts were out of her bra.</p> <p>"Ohhhh.." she moaned as her orgasm hit. As the orgasm shook her from head to toe she collapsed on the bed beside me. I felt the waves of pure pleasure as the cum oozed from my cock. I had a feeling that she might have gone on too long, but then she recovered her poise in a way that was more erotic, and also more sensual as she held me in her arms. I looked into her eyes as she held me close, and our naked bodies pressed close together.</p> <p>"So good." It was quite a statement, as I realized she was really in the mood to kiss me. It was an invitation to some of my better, if not the better, ideas. I wasn't about to disappoint her, so I put one of my arms around her waist as I pulled my own hands down to her breasts. My right hand caressed a breast that I wanted to caress as I started to caress the nipples between my index finger and thumb. Her body responded, and her moans turned into a low voice.</p> <p>"Yesssss. Oh, fuck!" Her legs spread wide as she started moaning again. Her hips started to move again.</p> <p>"Let's try something else. Just take me to bed with you." She said. That was it! I was not to guess what she would do, but at this point I would be glad to have figured it all out. I moved to a prone position on the bed as she straddled my waist, her hands holding my face tightly as she kissed me. I could taste a hint of her on her lips and tongue as our tongues were entwined like we had been for so long. It was a sensual, sweet, magical kiss, and somehow it took a little more time than one might expect for the passion of the moment.</p> <p>"Ohhhh." Was all that could be heard, but just the fact that her hands started to tease her breasts was all that mattered. My own hands were now pulling her hips down to position her pussy so it was more open as I could get my mouth to her nipples.</p> <p>They seemed to be longer then she had before. She was moving now, and her breathing was coming quicker. I could feel her hot wetness on my stomach as I continued sucking on her nipples. She let out a squeal as I bit just a little on them and pulled away. I rolled them between my teeth and heard, "Ohhhh.... Ohhhh..... Yessss"</p> <p>As my tongue flicked her nipple again, I felt her hips moving faster as her hand found it's way to her mouth and she was moaning. Her mouth was open, and her eyes closed. She opened them again when I let go of them and started to lick her pussy again. She had a look of ecstasy, and looked at me, when she started to kiss me and when I stopped. As both of us were kissing.</p> <p></p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhhsso good" me. Oh" me. So. Ahh.
