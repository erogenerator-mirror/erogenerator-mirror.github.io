G. Wells </h3><h4>The Machine</h4><p><strong>The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and</strong> it was one which the Time traveller found in many parts of the Federation universe. At first glance, the space station seemed to be much larger than a human space station, but then, as before with every other station, the size became apparent. There was a similar thing in their other universe, but they'd all been crammed into space a lot. A second object on the station was a piece of glass, although the glass itself was made of a similar glass to the one which the Space Pirate Alliance had made the space station. There appeared to be silver again, and something else, but no silver. At the same time, it resembled glass in appearance, though it was clear that it was made of something much more complex.</p> <p>A third object was a metal cylinder connected to a third object in the chamber beyond the outer wall, a similar model to the space station, but larger than the others. It appeared to be a piece of crystal, and it had a shape similar to the one that the space station had made.</p> <p>There was also a third object on the station's table, which appeared to be a black sphere that would've looked twice as much like a clock if there were any other things in the station at the time. There appeared to be another object with no markings, but it was obviously a human person in the middle of it. It appeared to be a woman, though this seemed strange, as though one person was going to do a woman thing and one person was taking a man thing, and so what the heck it was a man thing, anyway?</p> <p>All three things on the top surface were of course of a similar substance.</p> <p>The first thing was the crystal, a black crystal, with a few dozen different metallic patterns.</p> <p>The fourth object was a silver spherical object that appeared much like what the crystal looked like, but in other terms, it appeared to be an asteroid.</p> <p>The first thing on the end of the table was perhaps the best symbol that any of them had yet seen.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
