It's important.'</p> <p>'Why? Please, fuck me, Adam, fuck me. Don't hold back.'</p> <p>'Come in my cunt, Adam,' he begged.</p> <p>'Please, fuck me, Adam.'</p> <p>He was surprised by the eagerness in his voice and the urgency of his thrusts.</p> <p>'Let me do it,' he gasped. 'Fuck me.'</p> <p>I love it when you say your dirty, naughty words. You don't hear me complain, do you?'</p> <p>'Adam, please don't worry about the words.'</p> <p>'Are you sorry that your dirty, naughty words get hurt, Adam?'</p> <p>'Fuck yes! Adam's dirty words hit me when I said their names like those in their book. Don't say them, Adam.'</p> <p>'Do you like dirty words in your sexy, naughty vocabulary, Adam?'</p> <p>'You have no idea, Adam.' His words were like honey and his words were like honey because of his love for her.</p> <p>'I like dirty words in my nasty, secret, precious vocabulary. So you love dirty words in your naughty vocabulary.'</p> <p>With my words, which have so far been limited and secret, I can say: 'Adam is the big, strong, man who takes all of my holes.'</p> <p>His words were only half of a story.</p> <p>There is that big, strong man who takes all my holes whenever I want. I'm the big, strong, man whom he wants to take all my holes whenever he wants. I'm the big, strong man who he wants to take all my holes whenever he wants. Say those words, too, I was going to say them. He's the big, strong, man who I want to take my holes whenever I want.</p> <p>'Fuck me, Adam, fuck me. Fuck me and kiss me.'</p> <p>'Your dirty words make me want to go hard, Adam.'</p> <p>He was moaning, I guess. His dirty words gave me an idea so I decided to give her all those dirty words. So I asked her permission, I asked her to say filthy, secret, precious vocabulary, 'Adam', when she told him that 'Adam' is the big, strong man whom he wants to take all my holes whenever and whenever I want him to. It feels good. So as to start our fucking, he asked to say it in my sexy, sexy, naughty words.</p> <p>'Thank you, Adam,' she said. 'I love your dirty words.'</p> <p>'I love dirty words, as in 'dancing' and 'fucking' and 'cunt'. Don't say dirty words. Say them dirty words. Say that dirty words in the right order and then you feel that love and the love that you have for me. Say those naughty words, Adam,' she said.</p> <p>'I am happy that you love dirty words.'</p> <p>'I love dirty words of my lover.'</p> <p>'Thank you for fucking me, too, Adam. Thank you for fucking me.'</p> <p>'I love dirty words in my naughty, privileged vocabulary.

I love dirty words in my naughty, privileged vocabulary. I love dirty words in my naughty, privileged vocabulary. I love dirt words with you.'</p> <p>I didn't want to tell her these naughty words as much as I should. It was a lie in her words that she was enjoying them. It's like she enjoyed her dirty, dirty words because she knew that she loved them. It is what made her happy. I wanted to love and love my sexy, naughty words too. I was happy that I love dirty words in my dirty, privileged vocabulary, as well as saying them in the forbidden way. I was happy that I used dirty words in the forbidden way which I knew and loved. In the forbidden way where I hope to love and love my dirty words.</p> <p>I was so happy that she would love dirty words in the forbidden way. I didn't know whether I should tell her dirty words or just to encourage her because of her words or if I was the one who should kiss her and enjoy her words of love. Only I could figure out which way to proceed.</p> <p>I told her: 'You're very beautiful, Amy. You have such beautiful, beautiful, pretty, naked skin.</p> <p></p> <p>naughty, dirty words?
