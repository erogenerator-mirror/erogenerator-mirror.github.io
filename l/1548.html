There he was before me, in motley, as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic, fabulous. His very existence was</strong> a matter of instinct. It was the greatest, perhaps the greatest most exciting and most incredible thing that ever happened to me in my life! “</p> <p>I looked at the bed, thinking it was a bedroom. I had never bedded such a woman in my life. I looked at her, a woman that never slept in my bed. It had always been her.</p> <p>“Fuck me,” I heard her saying in that voice of hers. There was a new urgency in that voice. There was the feeling of her vagina around my cock. It was warm and wet. It was smooth and tender and oh, so soft like velvet and silk.</p> <p>I had come in her a virgin.</p> <p>The feelings of ecstasy. Her lips and vagina sucking.</p> <p>“Yes,” she called. “Suck on my tits like you suck on your own.”</p> <p>I did.</p> <p>The sounds were music to my ears.</p> <p>She screamed with delight.</p> <p>“Oh, god!”</p> <p>“That’s it. I love the feeling. That sound.” She said. “Yes. Fuck me. Fuck me.” She wailed and said my name in some language that sounded like “Yes.”</p> <p>The feeling was fantastic. It was like being there with a man, in this most wondrous way. There was no pain. There was nothing but joy in what we were doing and in what she was saying.</p> <p>I wanted to push my cock between her legs. To thrust me there and drive it into her in one thrust. It was not as hard as you had fucked a woman you were with yesterday. No effort from me, just the feeling of her vagina as it squeezed and held me there.</p> <p>She gave a long wail of ecstasy with her pussy squeezing my cock and letting me thrust it in and in and in and in.</p> <p>I did.</p> <p>I felt her breasts and nipples, her face and lips. The heat of her body and the feeling of her breasts were exquisite. The excitement as I thrust my cock into her.</p> <p>I had cum like a man, in her.</p> <p>She was enjoying the feel of my cock.</p> <p>The feeling of my cock in her as she thrust her tongue into my mouth and pushed herself against it. The feeling of her body.</p> <p>“Do it all the way in my pussy – fuck me.”</p> <p>“I want to cum there,” she said.</p> <p>“Please do it,” I said.</p> <p>I felt it all at once. The sense of it all. I was completely and utterly in love with her.</p> <p>I did.</p> <p>She took my cock up into her.</p> <p>It was the feeling you do; the feeling of a man’s dick as it rammed up into your own vagina while a woman moves her vagina upon it.</p> <p>I could not hold back.</p> <p>I thrust hard into her and did so with a passion.</p> <p>“Oh, yes! That’s the way, do it!” she said. Then she said words that were words as well as words as I had ever heard.</p> <p>“Fuck me. Fuck me hard.”</p> <p>“Fuck me fast! I’m almost there!</p> <p>“Oh, yes!” she said as she continued to fuck me. “I’m going to come!”</p> <p>“I’m going to come!” I said. “I’m coming . . . I’m . . . I’m . . . I’m . . . I’m coming. I’m cumming!” I shouted and my voice was a yell of passion and urgency.</p> <p>Her vagina clamped and sucked at me. “Yes! Yes! Give it to me!</p> <p>I’ll come in you. Don’t hold back . . .</p> <p>I was as hard as I could be with her.</p> <p>And to see her smiling back at me, at my voice, at those beautiful eyes, those lovely full, soft lips, those perfect cheeks, that magnificent mouth . . it was beautiful.</p> <p>We came and came together in orgasmic joy.</p> <p>Slowly, together in my bed.</p> <p>My face was flushed and perspiring.</p> <p>I could not help but feel a little embarrassed and happy. I had thought of it as something not to do with children but with women. and as a man. of course, that kind of lovers.. -of-of.. I mean.. that, and, the “I thought.
