He felt his heart jump into his throat and feel like it would explode from his entire heart in that moment, a warm flood of love that seemed to be running a merry little lope through his veins; all of it was so real. He was still trying to find his voice but just couldn't, as his mother was looking straight into his eye, and staring back at him with such intensity that it felt as if he were being torn between anger, hate, pity, and loneliness. His mother was an actress whose name he had not seen before, but who had once been his best friend. For as long as he could remember, he had always been interested in his mother and as he had always been attracted to her; whenever he came to her, he could always sense an attraction between them. Now, he felt it, a feeling that he couldn't define; the way his mother held herself as if she was naked in every moment, his mother was bare, so vulnerable, and in awe of her; her eyes were looking into his, she smiled warmly and smiled sweetly at him and he felt such a connection with her, to be that she was that in his heart, and to love her the way that he had always loved his mother. She was a woman, his mom, the mother of whom his heart was made, one of whom he felt so close when he looked at her. At that moment, he had thought of his mother in the way someone is to look at a child, at the way they look at their child, at the way they feel an attraction to their child.</p> <p>As if a switch had been flipped off in his head, his mother's finger traced a line through his blood, down across his chest, up toward the top of his thigh, and she pressed against him; the fingers of her free hand were caressing him. She could feel the heat and the pulsing and the throbbing of his dick in her hand, her body was on fire and burning it alive and it was hers to do with as she pleased. She took a few steps backwards as she moved her lips from his shoulder to his neck, and as she kissed him there, she was able to feel him pressing against her. She wrapped her fingers around his dick and she began to squeeze it, moving her hand up and down the length of him slowly. She stroked him with one hand, feeling the weight of his cock and stroking it with her thumb as she brought him closer to climaxing and closer to giving him his virginity. She pulled her mouth away from his neck and breathed warm air on the tip of his nose so that he would have no warning but to do as she said. She closed her eyes and began to lick and kiss her way up and down his neck. She moved her neck up and down to take him deeper into her mouth, licking slowly and lightly while at the same time, circling his dick with her lips.</p> <p>His moans of pleasure could be heard throughout the house. She watched him as he watched her, taking in the way that he was looking at her, so vulnerable, so sexy, so young. She smiled at how he looked at her. He had never looked at her like that before, because he always had wanted to be a boy but never felt he had time to really study, and he could remember every inch of her face, the curve of her lips, and her eyes. She wanted nothing more than to kiss him then in response to his lusting mouth, but she decided against it, it wouldn't matter that it was only sex. She moved on top of him, lying on top of him and her chest crushed firmly against his, and she kissed him again. The sound of their kissing made her own arousal even more, her own desire palpable. She moved off his hips, onto her knees. She moved forward and began to lick and suck on all of his dick. She closed her lips around him as she began to bob on his cock, and she could taste her own excitement on his dick. She moved her mouth back and forth, licking, sucking, and rolling his head with her tongue. She licked her lips and he watched as her tongue played with his pre-cum on each downstroke, her own tongue swirling around her head the whole time. He felt like he would be able to stay hard for months. Jean Valjean was having one of her best orgasms, feeling the rush of it up and down; he thighs, her pussy, arms, hands, all of them all of her. She looked as if he was looking at her every moment at it before she licked her lips, looked to his cock, and blew him and sucked him.
