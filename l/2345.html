G. Wells </h3><h4>After the Story</h4><p><strong>“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely incredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here tonight in</strong> my fantasy and I feel so sexy.”</p> <p>“I feel the same way. This is the closest I’ve ever been to an encounter with you.”</p> <p>The kiss was like a bolt of electricity in my mind, a bolt that I had never experienced before. My nipples were like bullets and my crotch, which was as hard as rock, was itching for attention. He unbuttoned my shirt, and slid the straps off my shoulders. Then he pulled back the straps of my top and removed the top I had been wearing. I felt the cool air of the air conditioning blow on my large breasts; then I felt the breeze of the fireplace on my chest. He gently grasped both nipples between thumb and forefingers and rolled them gently. It was the first time he had touched me like this before. I was in heaven. I could not believe how hot, how sexy, how erotic it felt. His hands left me and he stood up, which made me very excited and confused at the same time. He then reached between our bodies and unfastened his pants. As they fell away he continued to caress my breasts and nipples. With his hand still clutching mine he moved over to the mantle and got a bucket of ice which he set on the floor. He then knelt down on the floor and leaned back against the mantle where I could see him masturbating to his own fantasy. I could not believe he had been doing this for years, and would not touch me again.</p> <p>I knelt down again and unbuttoned his shirt, sliding it from his shoulders and dropping it on the floor. He took it off his shoulders, and dropped it to the floor. His muscles were taut under my ministrations. “That seems a bit uncomfortable,” I said to him, as I knelt and kissed the base of his cock through his trousers.</p> <p>He took my shirt off and looked directly at it, then he reached behind me and undid my bra. I slipped it off and stood to him. As he looked me over I could tell from his expression that he thought I had a very sexy body. My nipples were rigid and he saw that already. I let him see some soft curves from her breasts, which were very sensitive to the touch. He leaned over and took one between his lips, licking it. I could tell it did the trick and my pussy started to tingle with excitement.</p> <p>His hands pulled out my panties and I stepped out, completely naked, from the waist down. He quickly pulled them off and then stood up.</p> <p>“No!” I said in shock, “not again. Let me be, I need to taste those gorgeous breasts.”</p> <p>I wanted his cock in my mouth again. I wanted to suck him. I wanted to feel his lips spread down over my body, but I knew he would be too tired to put a hard cock in my pussy.</p> <p>I sat in the middle of the fireplace and he knelt down and took his cock in his strong hands, and guided the tip to my mouth. I leaned forward, opened my mouth slightly and he began to rub his cock head on the smooth skin between my breasts. My nipples were already at full attention. He squeezed them between his fingers and rubbed a finger into my cleavage, then used his other hand to rub the underside of my breasts. I loved it when he made the whole body move in his hands like that. He leaned forward and began to suck my nipples. I loved it when he did that. He pulled his hand back so I could just feel one hand at my breast, cupping it in his large hand. He continued on and I felt my pussy heating up with moisture. He could tell I was ready for him, so he moved his face lower and slid his cock deep into my pussy. I was so wet that he slid right into me in one smooth stroke. At the same time I felt his hands on my breasts squeezing them. I could feel his cock moving in and out of me; I could feel him against my pubic bone. The heat of him made me tingle in places that were not in control.</p> <p>He began to fuck me harder, and I could feel his fingers rubbing my aching clitoris.</p> <p>I could tell he was going to lose it if I didn’t suck him more. I was not sure if I would be able to manage one, but I knew there was no way he was letting me down. He slowed his fucking and continued stroking my clitoris. I knew he was close. I moved my mouth toward his and we kissed. It was a deep probing kiss that made me want more. He pulled away after about half way and I was out but continued the kiss. I could feel him hard, it inside me on my clit, and his weight on my stomach. He was on my pussy—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
