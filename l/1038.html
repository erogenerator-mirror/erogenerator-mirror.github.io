I say it like an eager student. It's the last one to say so, as if the first one doesn't already know its own thoughts.</p> <p>"I'm surprised! I'm stunned! Can I touch?" It's the first time this question has been asked and I smile, knowing that. I'm surprised that I can do.</p> <p>"What? Are you sure?" I do, even as I'm talking to myself. I'd love to, anyway.</p> <p>"No, sweetie. I was just thinking."</p> <p>"But you... you have a penis! Oh my!" I squeal and he gets closer. God, he is good looking in the way he is.</p> <p>"There's a difference. You're much shorter; you're much too big for me not to be interested in your equipment. I'm the lucky one who is the lucky one!" I giggle as he goes further; he's just a bit longer than I am at six and a half inches. I've had plenty of guys.</p> <p>"What is your size?" I ask. If I'd known him in high school he wouldn't have said it.</p> <p>"Well, I'd say it's not important," he replies.</p> <p>"Well, I'd better get my own," I say and he makes a face. "I'd say it's all in curiosity," and I do and he does, too, but he's as gentle a lover as you can be. I don't really know how. How does he manage to make me cum and cum and cum and cum, the way he does it?</p> <p>"It's not about any part," he replies when I make a joke or a joke isn't going to take so long. He knows better than that. I think he knows better. He knows what I mean. He knows what I want. He knows what I want.</p> <p>"There is a difference. We're two people of different ages and it's not about any particular part of sex. You're a handsome guy, so why don't you take my things off?"</p> <p>"Really?" He gives me his name. Just like I expect. This is so much higher off than the surface, I realize.</p> <p>"Really," I ask again and he comes too.</p> <p>"So, you'd really prefer to come in my hand or my body?" I ask, though I have nothing to say about that since I already know he'd prefer that from you. I'm so glad you asked me. He's been talking about me like that all night, but this is different. I don't like that.</p> <p>"It's different," he says, trying to act casual. "I'm a boy."</p> <p>"Your cock?" I'm shocked. He's so young. I've got it.</p> <p>"Sure," he finally relents.</p> <p>"And you don't mind that I'm a grown woman? I'm not too old for... to... to enjoy a real man's, uh... a real man's... cock, do I?" I don't know why I sound so naïve. I'm embarrassed because I want him. I don't believe anyone else knows my body. I never know what to do with it. Oh, no.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he confirms.</p> <p>"And I want you... I want to take that into my mouth," I say, taking his hand from mine and laying it on my breasts. I lean forward, resting one hand against his face, the other hand on top of his. He runs his thumb across my nipple, sending waves of warmth through me.</p> <p>"I'd like that too," he agrees, looking into my eyes.</p> <p>"I'm not sure... about... it," I say. He's a bit on the shy side. I'm embarrassed. That's what makes it so much more exciting. And it's what makes it so safe. He's so sweet.</p> <p>"I mean... do you want me to have sex with you? If so, just say so. If not, you don't have to put your penis in my mouth. OK?" I can feel a nervousness in him too, so I'm relieved. He nods.</p> <p>"Good. So shall I say yes?" It's the last one so many times during the game that I'm uncertain whether I should answer or not. This game, and, if it's true, then what makes any part of a game.</p> <p>"Yes." I just want to do you do. You want to do," he says it," and both of us, one. We say so quietly, too. He does—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
