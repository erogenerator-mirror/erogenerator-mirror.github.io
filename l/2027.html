As every fancy and imagination presents itself unto thee, consider</h4><p><strong>(if it be possible) the true nature, and the proper qualities of it, and reason with thyself about it.</strong> It was at this moment that she would take on his cock and let him know her sexual secret desires, that she would let him have sex with her in the dark to his enjoyment. In this one moment, at this particular moment, she would be his for life and the very same as he was hers, to be completely in his control and to fuck her every way.</p> <p>She knelt down and pulled his jeans and boxers off. With the jeans around his ankles she dropped to her knees and took his cock in her hands, feeling it with her fingers as she began slowly licking the underside of his dick, enjoying it, tasting it. With her tongue and her warm saliva coating it she gently took it in her hand and began to run her hand lovingly up and down the shaft, feeling how hard, strong and hot it was as she did so. With one hand she began to stroke it, with her other she reached back into his boxer shorts and pulled out his shaft and began to lightly stroke it as she sucked his head.</p> <p>With his cock filling her mouth she felt as if every nerve ending in it were alive, the feeling, the size of the cock, the taste, the texture. Her tongue circled his crown and she felt it swell and begin a slow descent to the back of her throat as he began to groan. She felt his cock swell and get even harder in her mouth as he began to thrust it in and out and then in all direction. When he got all the way down she felt the tip of his cock touch the back of her throat, and this would stop for moment and just hold it there. Then they would resume, when she started to suck him in and out, slowly. She had learned to keep her mouth and throat in very close quarters so as not to gag and then just as he was filling her mouth she pulled off to savor the sensation of him in her throat and in her face. She then reached back into his briefs and took his cock out of her own and began stroking it with both hands as she made love to it with her mouth.</p> <p>The feel of it in her hands and in her mouth was incredible. It was not anything like she had felt before. It was the natural, the way a woman does things. It was the way she felt when she had a man's entire cock in her mouth as she suckled them and stroked them. It was the way a woman's heart made love to its sex partner and, now that it was she was doing it so that he wanted it she enjoyed it more and more. With him in her mouth she continued to suck him to the first slow, deep stutter, which only made him thrust deeper into her mouth. She moaned with its intensity as she sucked him, as he slid fully back down her throat. As her mouth went up and down his cock she moved her hands up to his chest as she began to push on his cock with both of her own. Moving with him she felt him reach almost completely under her to stroke her back as his hips began to move in a rapid counterpoint to her own motions. She could feel that she was about to come. He knew it as well and began to thrust deeper into her mouth and as he did so her body began to shake and shook with a powerful orgasm. She was cumming. She was cumming so much that her cum exploded out of it and down her thighs on to the carpet. She could feel her legs beginning to tremble slightly as her whole body, her entire being became one with the feel of her orgasms.</p> <p>He kept his weight on her as a moment of weakness overcame her, and she could no longer feel her legs. Her entire body, her entire being was one with the feel of her pleasure as she was cumming. She still could feel his warm breath on her neck as he kissed it and licked it from her neck to her shoulder while her hands still held him tightly in her mouth. Her knees buckled but she held him and could do nothing else except moan and hold him closer in her mouth.</p> <p>They had all the time in the world and he had every intention of taking them to the other side of the room. He moved again, and held her while her legs were still spread for him. He felt her hands in his hair and in his hair too. They felt in the world like a mirror in the mirror. They could do this, together as one, all the way. As she looked in the mirror at him she could see the very same desire in his eyes in that face. She could see his lust in the face. The same desire in his eyes. They stared into each others eyes as she looked back at him.</p> <p>Then, slowly his penis began to rise up the length of her body until it was between her wetly exposed breasts, wetly exposed breasts, he stroked gently. He slid his hands down and touched her belly and took a thumb andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
