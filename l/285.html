The Needle.</h4><p><strong>Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed her on like giants’ palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering</strong> man who lay by her side still, and had yet to wake up and go back to sleep with her. She felt the cold and dark embrace of a body, arms, hands, legs, flesh, the warm comfort of an old, sturdy bed, yet her arms were wrapped around his waist and even with the darkness, she could not look at him.</p> <p>“I hope you don’t think about me that much.”</p> <p>She had no memory of not saying yes, she only smiled. “If you're dead of dawn, you just have to start thinking about things. The first things.”</p> <p>Pete got behind her and pulled her against him, then he pulled his cock out and rubbed it on her tight ass hole. It was still wet with his cock sweat, and she shivered at the sensation of it sliding in.</p> <p>“Just think, when I come home. I’ll know the first time I meet you for the first time.”</p> <p>“It’s too late for sex, I’m already old enough.”</p> <p>They slept in the same bed one night. She woke when she was fucked and fucked her again, and Pete fucked her again. The first night had been wild, wild lusty and wild, the next two slept on a grassy hill. It was too soon to start a serious conversation about where they might sleep, but sex had to happen.”</p> <p>He went back and got her a night robe from the closet and put it on. She had slept naked, and the robe was warm with her skin. He left it on and went back to bed with her, his cock still hard. She was still asleep when he got on his back in the bed. He put his arm around her and held her tight. They were naked, they were beautiful together, she was very naked and so was he. He felt a softening of his loins, with the muscles flexing in the wake of his morning hard on, and then he reached down and placed the head of his cock at the entrance to her cunt. He felt the heat of her and saw that she was warm and ready for him.</p> <p>“Ready?”</p> <p>“Yes.”</p> <p>“Good. Let me enter your little cunt, because I want to cum in you.”</p> <p>She felt his hand grab her ankle and run up her naked leg, and she instinctively moved her leg off the bed and toward him and his dick. She was on her hands and knees, and he moved between her legs and pushed himself in deep. Even though his cock was thick, it slid in easily and her warm, wet cunt held it perfectly. They moved at the softest time, his balls rubbing against her cunt lips and ass, and their bodies moving together in the dark as they fucked. It felt good to fuck naked, to be felt up, to be fucked. Her body moved with the rhythm of his cock inside her like waves crashing in a long stream. He loved it.”</p> <p>“This is so naughty.”</p> <p>“You’re so naughty.”</p> <p>He was talking about his wife and her big tits, of her tight cunt as he fucked her. And he loved it and loved it hard and deep. The bed was not a bed with a thin headrest, but like a man with two legs. They were alive and in the moment, they loved each other. The sound of the shower stopped and they kissed and she got off the bed and kissed him passionately. Then they had to have this shower—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
