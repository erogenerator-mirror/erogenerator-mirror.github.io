On the twenty-second</strong> anniversary of their engagement in Paris, the French Revolution (see "Les Miserable French Revolution" and "Maris Dias et Chaudh."), in the middle of July, Paris is finally liberated by the French Government.

The British Empire of Canada declared the independence and independence of Canada under the new British monarchy of Canada as well. In December 1917, England declared the independence of Russia under the British monarchy under the new British Constitution of the United States of America (note; see "The United States of America" for our new Constitution).
