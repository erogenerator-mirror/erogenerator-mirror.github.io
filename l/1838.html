Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shall ever constrain</h4><p><strong>thee either to break thy faith, or to lose thy modesty; to hate any man, to suspect, to curse, to dissemble, to lust after anything, that requireth the secret of</strong> my virginity. If only you could see the truth in the dark shadows, and the truth befell, the devil to be sure, thy virginity?</p> <p>A week later, I heard from her that she had written a letter to me. I asked her what she was doing, and she replied. She asked if I liked to fuck. It was simple:</p> <p>"I do, you."</p> <p>"Well, I could do that right now."</p> <p>"Well, why did you write me?"</p> <p>"Because, I don't wanna let you fuck."</p> <p>"I'm not going to fuck you. I already fucked you. I already fucked your husband."</p> <p>"So you don't want to fuck me?"</p> <p>"I already fucked. I already came. My husband is a lucky man."</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to be a part of me?"</p> <p>"Absolutely," I replied.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>I didn't get the hint that she, in her own personal world, didn't see. She wrote back:</p> <p>"Oh, my pussy's so sore, and so wet. I don't want you to fuck until I'm completely ready. I want you to lick me until I come all over your fucking face and taste it. I want you to lick my cunt until I suck your cock until I can't believe I'm able to take a cock in my cunt for even a second. I want you to fuck me until my knees shake, and for I'll suck you off until I come."</p> <p>And on and on she went, telling me things that I should never hear from her, and saying things that would embarrass me. She never even wrote a reply.</p> <p>Now, this was where I got the surprise: it's like that in movies, where the hero goes into a house and finds a woman that'll have her husband's cock all night...but this time I got an audience of one. She had me sit in a chair, my eyes looking down, her panties on the floor in front of me. As soon as my cock was hard enough, she reached over and pulled them down. A second later, she had her entire hand wrapped around my cock, and was rubbing herself from all directions. A woman is not allowed to have sex while the male actor is having anal sex with her. I was not allowed to have an erection if the man was kissing her ass, while the man is fucking her mouth or pussy. My cock was being rubbed on everything, inside the walls of her cunt. The sound of her hand on my cock, mixed with the moaning and groaning of the movie, made the whole thing more than I could imagine.</p> <p>"You are really wet down there, Baby."</p> <p>"I'm as hot as a bitch would be if she could get her hands dirty from sticking it in a girl."</p> <p>I felt her pussy twitch, the wetness between her legs becoming much more evident as the excitement built. She didn't even stop when my hand began to caress her stomach and nipples, but began to caress my cock a little harder, rubbing the tip of it up between her lower lips and against her clit.</p> <p>"Are you going to cum?"</p> <p>"I'll wait." I was already starting to lose control. She wanted me to cum before I came. To make me wait, she said she wanted to see me lose control, and she wanted to see it come out of me.</p> <p>"I don't think the lady would like that, so it has to come from somewhere else."</p> <p>"You'll like it, won't you, sweetie? Would you, baby?</p> <p>My heart was beating faster, faster for even the slightest motion, but it seemed so natural that it shouldn't be.</p> <p>"I'll be glad to suck you."</p> <p>She kept stroking me, as it started to become more like the sensation that I first felt in the theater; it came from my balls being massaged.</p> <p>"You're so fucking wet, Sweetheart. I love this. I'm so fucking wet, baby."</p> <p>As with the theater at the moment, there wasn't much of a time limit, just the moment for us to decide that we wanted to do this. My hand stroked her thigh, sliding up. The contact made her clit pulse, her body arch.</p> <p>"Cum so I can taste you, Honeyie."</p> <p>She was getting off on this, and it only made her more excited.</p> <p>"I'm so wet, I gotta come."</p> <p>"I know. Here, lie down."</p> <p>I laid on my back, and spread my cock still in her. She got on the chair. like me. . as she lay there before me. her. I had. I closed her.
