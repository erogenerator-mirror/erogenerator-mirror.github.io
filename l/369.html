From the far side of the house through the closed doors</strong> and across the room he could still hear the drumming of angels and the chimes of the wedding march, although it was now very early in the evening.</p> <p>He was in his bedroom having discarded his coat which had come off earlier in the day when he had heard a cry of delight from the bedroom window beside him. He had looked across the room but there wasn't a single person in sight. He looked toward the window as his thoughts drifted to the bride. 'No one can see in,' he thought hoping it was the best answer possible. His eyes kept roaming over the beautiful bride, her dress undone, her large breasts held in her black silk bra. He could see her face through the sheer material of her dress. He also could see the white of her bra. Her hands were tightly fastened around his head as he sucked her clitoris. The only thing he could picture and not think about was the many orgasms that had taken place during the last few days. 'If it was just for a few hours' he thought, 'I wouldn't remember it,' as his mouth returned to her body as much as possible, and continued to lick her pussy in the most wonderful and erotic way. He was so turned on by the act.</p> <p></p> <p>***Chapter 27***</p> <p></p> <p>It was the next morning when he felt that the night had come to an end. He was in an adjoining room, naked. He was lying down and it wasn't the first time someone had fucked him, but it was the first time someone had fucked him in an identical position before on his bed, with a cock that seemed to be able to ejaculate so very quickly. He had thought it was impossible to last like that, but after a very quick climax he knew how to make the experience the strongest possible.</p> <p>This morning though, it had turned out to be just as good. It was so very beautiful! As the young prince had left the bedroom, he had been disappointed that the bedroom curtains had been closed and it had seemed to go on for ever. 'There, we can look apart', as he had walked through the house's corridor. He had noticed that all the lights were on, as he had expected. He hadn't expected that anybody might be waiting at any time when he left the bedroom. As he had left the room in his pyjamas, he had not wanted to think about it much.</p> <p></p> <p>***Chapter 28***</p> <p>The couple, a couple that had known each other only about a couple of years, had moved in together, but since then, they hadn't got around to actually fucking. One would never want to meet someone without a boyfriend and the other one who had a boyfriend never wanted to see a man with a cock. Now they were sharing a bed.</p> <p></p> <p>He could hear someone in the bedroom next to the corridor. He could also hear the woman moving about. 'Are you coming out?' the woman asked loudly as the man's mouth descended on her sex. 'Do you want to fuck?' she asked louder as she lifted his head and pushed it down on her, forcing his mouth hard against her. She held his head still as she ground her face against the young prince's cock. With his arms round the girl's body, she was forcing her face hard against her. He could smell the musky odour of the man's cum as it was being sucked on. She was holding him tightly, but not so hard as to hurt, and it felt so good that it hurt. Her cunt, covered in the juices of a man's spunk, was grinding into him. He could actually feel it being squeezed. It might have been hard to believe that the woman's cunt had been so wet and open to receive a man's seed this way, but it seemed that she liked to get fucked as much as she did a cunt filled with his sperm if she could get it out. He kept his mouth against her sex, not wanting to let his face go. He could still taste and smell her semen around his mouth and nose. He hated him for it so much in reality, but at the same time loved it. It was a beautiful thing. He would remember this feeling for the rest of his days.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>***Chapter 29***</p> <p>It was the first time that he had been alone in his bedroom. He was getting out of bed. It was late and he wanted to spend the day alone before he went in search for his lover. It was dark and there weren't that many other clothes in his flat so he just undressed and took a couple of steps out the door to his wardrobe before putting on his pants. He felt as if something was in it rather than the warm it was.</p> <p>but it was warm the warm from her. Maybe it. It is hot from it. Like it it a warm</p> <p>and it or like a-</p> <p>hot hot- what it'</p> <p>was heatâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
