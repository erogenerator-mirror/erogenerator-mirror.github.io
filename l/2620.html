To Moses, the children of Israel say thus. (Exod. 20. 19) "Speak thou to us, and we will</strong> grant thee" ("Psalmsim")</p> <p>The only thing that can go wrong is putting Jesus' love in synch with his. I don't even need to ask what the Jews think of the Jews. My mind is a fog. I think about the Jews. I remember all my childhood. The Jewish people are so much more enlightened than I am. They say, what do you know? You aren't Jewish. I'm not sure that's true. I've heard from other Jews that I know that. They say it's a lie.</p> <p>Yet, I can't keep it from my self. I want my own version of the Jews right now. I'm a Jew.</p> <p>A Jew!</p> <p>I never realized that a Jew can be a very smart and pretty one. A lovely, smart, pretty Jew can be a beautiful, smart, pretty one. And a Jewish Jew can also be a smart and pretty little guy.</p> <p>It's true, but like that. A Jew has all of their needs and wants. But, most of all, it turns me on. And I love looking at my Jew topless and see how their nipples look.</p> <p>This is what I think is going to happen.</p> <p>It's not all that great of a show. But, at times I do love to see them.</p> <p>"Jesus, I'm getting hard."</p> <p>"Yes, you are."</p> <p>Then, he moves over to me, leans over and whispers.</p> <p>"You sure you want me to do this?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He says it with certainty.</p> <p>Well, he has the nerve to suggest, oh my gosh! I'm in a hurry. I'm in the right mindset. I'm ready to take to the new level of sin. My cock starts to pulse and expand as he moves to my back. He holds my shoulders and guides me down onto my knees. As I lean over to go down on him, he places me over. I feel him lift and lower him into me. I feel the pressure building as he pushes it into me and down into my body. I push back down. I feel my balls lift and his body pushing down on them, rubbing them.</p> <p>Oh my gosh, that's exciting! I've never felt something so good.</p> <p>"I'm not going to last long. " I say in a soft voice. "I'm not that experienced, but I'm not sure I can last any longer."</p> <p>"Not even a little?"</p> <p>"Not at all," I say. "I'm not that experienced."</p> <p>"I'll be gentle."</p> <p>I'm not sure I can. He's so big. I wonder how. I can feel his big cock pulsing inside me. I wonder if I could take him all the way. I wonder what it would be like. Oh, god. If this goes any further, I'm coming.</p> <p>Then, he starts to raise and lower himself. The tip of his cock is brushing over my lips and it feels wonderful. I spread my legs to feel his cock on my body. It's very exciting. It's not so much fun. The feeling of his cock stroking my body with one hand, and I feel my cock starting to get harder also, I'm not sure how much longer that will be.</p> <p>"It's not that it isn't good looking. " I think. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, take me, please take me," I say in my sweetest tone.</p> <p>He moves faster. I can feel my body getting stronger, the desire to move up and down his cock, to be in my own orgasm. The feeling of a sexual charge rising, the fullness of his cock filling, I'm going to come. I'm going to fuck him. We're going to fuck each other. We're going to be one being. I'm moving to meet his slow strokes and move to his rhythm. The rhythm is slower for both of us. This is the feeling of complete ecstasy.</p> <p>"Oh, David, David." I say softly while he starts to fuck me. "That's it, that's it."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>My lover knows. I love him in his deepest way and I love his strength. I love the way he holds my body and I love the way I feel of being on his lap. I love how he's lifting me and sliding me up and down to his body. I love how I'm touching his body with his hand and holding my body. He's feeling my cock. I'm touching his mind with his body. I'm feeling. it, his body with his cock. I'm loving all of our bodies bodies, his heart. I'm touching my ownâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
