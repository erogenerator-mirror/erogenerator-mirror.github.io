Natásha was calm, though a severe and</strong> determined look was in her eyes.</p> <p>"Thank you for attending this luncheon."</p> <p>"Please have a seat."</p> <p>"I see you met your mother," said Natásha, standing up with one leg raised as she placed her hands on his upper thighs. She was wearing a black business skirt, black knee high stockings, and matching corset, the black garter belt and suspenders of a woman wearing a dress, but her white blouse hugged her body tightly, accentuating her large breasts and the thick dark nipples pushing through the fabric, "And you're the new wife of Father Josephine Chambre. She and my father have been married almost six years and have only been a couple. This is my Mother Mary. She and I are married now."</p> <p>"I'm afraid you are in the presence of a strange man, that you aren't appropriate for the wedding party," Pierre replied, his hands going up to her neck line.</p> <p>"The first woman to take my breath away would think you are just as handsome," she replied, her hand going down to his crotch, which was already beginning to grow, "And the second would only believe that."</p> <p>"It is the first time I have heard your voice," Pierre breathed, his hand moving upward to cup her left breast. He lifted it, finding the nipple through the fabric, and slowly squeezed it, feeling the soft pink flesh.</p> <p>"Do you love me more than you love father?" she asked.</p> <p>Pierre raised his arms, releasing the tie at his neck, letting his hands slide over Natæsha's shoulders, neck, and shoulders and down over the full orbs, kneading the flesh softly, pulling and squeezing them, and rubbing a thumb over the exposed nipple, a finger tracing the dark areola and circling the nipple, "And to answer the first question, yes, you are very special to me."</p> <p>"I also believe that father," Natæsha replied, "that you are very important to me."</p> <p>"I believe you mean it, I believe you in whatever you are going to do to me, so stop worrying about a husband," Pierre said, releasing her nipple. He bent down and placed lips to her navel, kissing it lightly, and moving down over her hips, stopping before the corset came off before his knees.</p> <p>Natásha's eyes were closed and her head was rolling from side to side, "Thank you," she murmured as he continued his slow journey, kissing her stomach, down her body, avoiding the dark patch just covering her pussy because he was afraid she might be getting turned on. She felt his hands on the waist of her corset, unfastening it, slowly lowering the garment down and uncovering the full, lush roundness of her womanhood, which he kissed and sucked for a couple of moments before moving on. He reached up and opened the buttons for her top, letting her breasts come free in the open collar as a treat. "This is a lovely blouse," he said softly, feeling his cock stiffening and pressing into her thighs. "It opens quite nicely." He kissed her lower belly as he unbuttoned her corset and lifted it off. The white cotton garment fell to the floor, leaving her beautiful chest, big breasts, with puffy areoles and nipples as soft red lips.</p> <p>She felt him move his hands up above her rib cage, caressing her sides and her chest, feeling his erection pressing against her as he knelt, his lips kissing the swell of her breasts, then kissing from the edges to the nipples.</p> <p>While still holding her breasts, he moved, lifting them, feeling them, enjoying seeing their fullness in his hands, his thumbs grazing her areolas, feeling the hard bumps under them and her whole body shivering at his touch.</p> <p>Soon he was licking and suckling the soft flesh, feeling her shudder while he bit gently on and around her nipple, as if it were a little cock, and slowly moved his mouth off, leaving it there as he ran his tongue over her areola again and again, making her groan.</p> <p>He was kissing and sucking and licking the other nipple now, but his hand reached down to her sex and he felt the warmth and wetness. Her hands were on the top of his head now, pulling him closer. He kissed and sucked his way down her belly to her navel, tonguing it gently before he reached her sex and slipped his tongue between her folds. She groaned and wiggled her hips a bit, pushing against his head.</p> <p></p> <p>in the room, he looked at a room was still sucking her eyes in the other had a room there, lying against his head was kissing his mouth was between her breasts.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>A little body, He had a mouth—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
