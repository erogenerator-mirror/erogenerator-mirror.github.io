It was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda, whose round, fluted columns supported the</strong> two towers, the upper, upper and lower steps leading the way into the house. At the top, right by the rear, was the large fireplace and two doors, one set at the front right and one at the back left where the guest stood in the shadows, watching her husband preparing to take her from behind in the master bedroom he had been occupying over her life.</p> <p>The large wooden bed was made out of logs, the bedhead and the mattress. The mattress had an ottoman on one corner, a roll of a chair on another side and a pair of matching pillows, and a large drape over the draping of the back. The canopy was pulled tight and an ornate rug was spread on top. The four corners of the bed were covered with a bedspread, and she could only hope that the duvet covering her face would fall away. She turned to give him a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"I didn't bring a pillow for your face."</p> <p>"I know you didn't."</p> <p>He turned the pillow aside and lay it down on the table beside the bed. He kissed her lips. It felt wrong. She kissed him back.</p> <p>The pair parted their lipsticks and he took her in his arms, his nose nuzzling her shoulder. Her fingers trailed down his back.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, but I can't do this. I can't just let you."</p> <p>She broke away, trying to find somewhere else they might have this week together -- anywhere they could be together. It was hard to admit it out loud to him. They had been together for years now, and this was the last chance at anything more than a quickie.</p> <p>"It's okay, I understand, no one else will."</p> <p>"But you're married?" Her voice was timid, and she didn't seem all that certain.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>But she didn't take off her clothes, even if it was to take a lover, and the moment wasn't awkward. It felt good to be naked beside him. He looked down at her. She was beautiful.</p> <p>"You look like you're ready for something," he said.</p> <p>She smiled. "Let's see what we can do."</p> <p>She kicked her sandals off, then unbuttoned her shirt. He leaned into, kissing the neck of her exposed cleavage. She gasped when he blew warm air over her nipple, and then he licked it to a hard standing peak. She squirmed against him.</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything, I won't say anything."</p> <p>She unzipped his pants and unzipped his pants. He groaned when she reached between their bodies for his stiff cock.</p> <p>"I'll let you suck on it now..."</p> <p>"Oh, please," he groaned. She took his rigid pole in her hand and looked at him with a hungry look. He was about seven inches and almost thick as a pipe. When she had first touched him, his erection had seemed to go away. She took his cock in her hands and began to stroke it.</p> <p>"Oh my ..."</p> <p>"I can't wait. I want to put it in your mouth now."</p> <p>His words set her on fire. She lay back on the bed, and his erection came into view, and she saw her husband's tongue lapping a line of pre-cum across the head. She felt it on her pussy.</p> <p>"Don't tease", she said.</p> <p>"We both want to do it. But I'm not done."</p> <p>"We have the rest of the week."</p> <p>"Fine," said her husband.</p> <p>She began to kiss his cock and balls, then put him in her mouth and she ran her tongue over his balls. She slid two fingers onto his anus and probed around. She smiled when she discovered he was tight.</p> <p>"Are you ready yet, lover?" she asked him.</p> <p>"I am."</p> <p>She stroked him with her hand. Her own cock had begun poking out of her bikini and it looked as though it was about to explode without any stimulation.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me now," he said. He pushed the palm of his other hand against her crotch.</p> <p>She smiled as he spread her labia apart and pressed against her pussy. He began to press in. She was so wet. He kept his cock in her hand.</p> <p>"Oh yes. I'm so good, fuck me. Please! I need you inside me"</p> <p>She pushed back against him.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh fuck me now, fuck me, take me.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>" Oh, don't, you must, don't, don't, don't, no, no, not, don't, don't, donâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
