The young lady who'd brought her that drink smiled with pleasure at the prospect of another orgasm, and she felt her heart flutter with pride. It was a pleasure for her too, and she found herself wishing for that sensation to be repeated every time before the journey.</p> <p>And of course, the feeling of a different hand on her clit was also a pleasure too. She enjoyed her orgasm so much from having people feel her up, and now she did too, and knew where these people were. She was also very excited at the thought there would be somebody watching her in such a public fashion, but to be watched in the dark was also different.</p> <p>It felt thrilling. She could even feel his eyes on her, and he was watching for the first time, her breasts, her clit - she looked sideways at her husband, and smiled even wider. She looked closer, trying to imagine someone else there to see her in such sexual arousal.</p> <p>The young Lady came suddenly and long, as she thought: what a relief. She wanted to be watched, enjoyed - her husband watching her - enjoyed - watched.</p> <p>She looked back at her escort, and she knew her words would have to be something more. It was time to be a slut, to be humiliated, to be used - she smiled back at those in the carriage.</p> <p>"Now, you can do better", she said. She felt her words spoken so clearly, so intimately.</p> <p>She had to obey, for there was something she wanted to do, and knew what.</p> <p>She felt his gaze burning itself into her. She felt aroused; she was aroused. She saw his trousers drop around his knees as his cock twitched with excitement. His hand was inside his shorts; the dark skin against the light cloth; his fist rubbing the head of his cock. It filled his hand and was a magnificent shaft.</p> <p>She wanted him too, but she felt she was in too much of a rush. She wanted to make herself come. She wanted something, something naughty to cum. And, what could it be that a servant could want.</p> <p>She looked him in the face and said: "You've earned this, my love", and she kissed him.</p> <p>Then she lowered her mouth to his and kissed him deeply. Then she looked to her friend who'd given her the drink to be continued. She looked at her husband with a wickedness in her eyes, and she knew he wanted to do as well. She grinned wickedly at him: she wanted him too.</p> <p>She didn't know which of the people her escort was, but she smiled a little at them to see the expression of pleasure on their faces. They were very happy with her.</p> <p>Then she turned to her friend.</p> <p>"It was nice to have another man's cock for me, for an audience, for a little pleasure at my breasts. He must be good, isn't he - he could be! He would have pleasure, and perhaps, as my next escort, we'd take him to another room. But perhaps I ought to think it is better that he had cum before.</p> <p>"But, I want to suck him off again - that was so nice, so perfect, a wonderful little orgasm, so special, so thrilling, he must be a man."</p> <p>She looked to her husband who was smiling and nodded.</p> <p>"He'll do! Come to my suite in half an hour - please, we must wait for him, for us.</p> <p>"Please, dear husband," she said, "we'll be late."</p> <p>She took a very long, very horny look at the escort lady's legs as she pulled them apart to let her skirt drop to the floor. She wanted both of them naked - she had to be absolutely sure her clothing would not show where she wanted it.</p> <p>"My, my, this is quite an eager little lady is she!" she said as she sat between his legs and began eating her husband's cum, her finger feeling it on her clit.</p> <p>"She's very eager!", she thought, "she should be." But, in her most naughty and sexy words...</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
