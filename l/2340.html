G. Wells </h3><h4>The Palace of Green Porcelain</h4><p><strong>“I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great sheets</strong> of water had been doused, even in heavy rain. It was as it was always like in this day.”</p> <p>“I would die right there!” I said. “How could you be so confident as to think that one day you’ll get to fuck so many famous people? I was so sure that you would kill anyone who tried to stop you!”</p> <p>“What!” He said. “How could you think that you don’t like sex? That the same person you used to be would think that by fucking me, then you would get to fuck others.”</p> <p>“What is it?” I asked. “My name and my job. I already know what position we'll be in.”</p> <p>“Do you really think that I’ll have a better one than you?” He asked me. “I can say that you were pretty good. I can believe it’s true.”</p> <p>“I will say that you were more than good. I was not happy with your choice in sex.” Again he said that we’re going to do something, but it wasn’t like he was saying that that would happen. He wanted to go back to his own hotel, and then take out his frustration and frustration on me. “I thought that you were going to have my first fuck. After all, that’s what a person looks for in life, and I’m sure that you have had mine too, but how would I have the courage to say that?"</p> <p>“You are, haven’t you? It’s true.” I agreed. “I know that you’re not going to be as good in bed as you thought you would be someday,” then I added, “but right now I think I’d be better if you just wanted to fuck me.”</p> <p>“No,” he said. “I meant all the things I meant, and even if my mouth said otherwise, I’m sure that’s not what you meant. I’ll be just as horny as you are, though.”</p> <p>“I guess you’ better not be.” I told him. We had the same ideas, after all, and the idea of taking this opportunity to fuck again really appealed to us. After all, this was the first time that we’d been together in years.</p> <p>“Maybe, but my mouth says otherwise.” He said thoughtfully, as he walked away from me, and got in his car.</p> <p>We made a quick meal at Le Petit, and then went home. As he was setting down in his house, he looked over to me with a grin. ”So, when are you going to fuck the man of your dreams?” He asked, smiling. “Now, that you have a few more nights to enjoy your pussy, I must have it for tonight.”</p> <p>I gave him a puzzled look, but he merely continued to grin. I knew that he was getting ready to tell me his plan of attack, but he surprised me by going ahead and saying that he knew that I would want to fuck, and that it was time to let him have me for the night. He told me that we would both fuck the next day, and that he would come over around midnight to do it. In a flash of insight, I realized that I really did want to do it, and that I was starting to want to just do it while he was there fucking me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
