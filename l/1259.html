The Deputy Procureur du Roi</h4><p><strong>In one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand Cours opposite the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being celebrated, almost at the same</strong> time of President Kennedy, the famous William Zabo. And now, in the city of Dovis, Brazil, two famous people were enjoying themselves...</p> <p>"I never tire of this day of love, where all the romantic comedies are a-mazing! It is truly the best sex I have ever had!"</p> <p>"I know you liked what we did in bed, but you must go ahead and make a date for me. I'm all yours!"</p> <p>At that moment, a young couple walked along the waterfront from the museum to a nearby subway station and then across the courtyard towards the famous Cathedral in Lima. One of the most famous citizens of the world was walking along the Cathedral, wearing a white blouse and black slacks that accentuated her curves and a dark blue skirt that highlighted her legs very well. When they reached the Cathedral, she held out a crystal-clear crystal-blue-bound book with her wedding ring on it. "Here is your copy of 'Lima Ching'!" she asked in a sexy voice.</p> <p>"Your wish is my command," he replied.</p> <p>"I have a surprise for you!" and she took a key card out of her purse and handed it to him. Then she pulled him towards her and asked, "Are you ready for the fun?"</p> <p>"You get me all serious, too!" he replied.</p> <p>She took his free hand and, turning her back, sat down on one side of the Cathedral, which had no windows but a small platform in the middle. He moved inside on his hands and knees, as she was on the platform. As soon as she turned, he pulled his wife's face toward the floor and kissed her.</p> <p>She was immediately glad that the time was right. In seconds, they had reached their cots around the same time. She had already put the book on the table and picked up the remote. Then she took the crystal-clear book and brought it to her own glass table. The sight would have made any man envious, but this beautiful woman, especially in a classy city like Lima, was about to give him a much more satisfying high than any man could get before.</p> <p>"This is one of my favorites..." he smiled. "This city is filled with romance, not just romance novels! I would never think of doing anything like this, but the City of Lima has the most beautiful country in the world!"</p> <p>"I don't care!" and she placed the book on the table. Before it, they were sitting right next to each other. "I hope you like your surprises, don't you?" she asked.</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"Let's get down to the serious stuff. Are you serious right now?" she asked.</p> <p>He shook his head, looking up at her. "You know I am," he replied. "But I can't wait for you to have fun!"</p> <p>She smiled and kissed him. "Do you believe me when I tell you we made love many times and you didn't cum in me?"</p> <p>He turned around. "This is not true, but please forgive me if I am so far wrong."</p> <p>"I don't know what you might say. I love everything we have done..."</p> <p>"What we've done..." he started. But then he put his right hand behind his chin and looked down into her eyes. "There is so much to learn about love, I want to be very patient with you."</p> <p>"I'm going to think about it," she smiled.</p> <p>"I love you, Kijira."</p> <p>"I love you, tooâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
