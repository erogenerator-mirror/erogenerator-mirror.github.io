We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night</strong> had become a blur of bright lights in many ways. In the distance, I could hear my best friends' voices laughing and gasping together at the top of a large rise, our heads above the water, as they made great leaps into the stars.</p> <p>"Hey," I called, breaking a smile. "Isn't that a good story?"</p> <p>We had a long walk, and then we returned home for the night.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>We sat quietly in bed that night, looking at the same ceiling fan hanging from it, but different in different ways. We listened to the same music and listened while it played over and over.</p> <p>Eventually, I got up. "Where did that go?" I asked myself.</p> <p>"You have to go get dressed," I promised with a smile.</p> <p>I quickly gathered my clothes and headed for a bathroom, intending to be presentable when I walked out into the night. When I came back in my bathroom, I was immediately assaulted by the sight of the bed, not looking at the night's stars anymore. I was already looking at them, and it didn't seem to bother me.</p> <p>I quickly grabbed my clothes and hurried to the bed. It was late, and I didn't know how people would react to what happened just a few hours after our holiday. I quickly got back to the bedroom when I saw lights still flickering from the door.</p> <p>I immediately rushed to the bed to help myself, and was surprised when I found two women kissing, and both of them rubbing their tits through the thin material of their shirts. Apparently, they liked to have their tits rubbed by men, I wondered. In fact, both women looked slightly disappointed when they saw the guys still sitting there.</p> <p>I grabbed the two women, both naked, but the shirts that I was wearing were still on the floor and I grabbed the other woman's shirt and threw it on herself. I quickly grabbed both of their tits and gave them the same treatment.</p> <p>I kissed each of their lips while they rubbed their tits together, and I quickly realized that the both were looking more excited about our new experiences. I felt the women's lips move down my neck slowly and I could feel their tongues flicking over my nipples. As the kisses got more passionate, I could feel the soft flesh of their breasts rubbing against my skin until finally their hands reached my hips.</p> <p>They quickly started to rub themselves against me, feeling for my hardness through the thin material of my briefs and I couldn't help but put forth my most pleasurable moan. As their hands moved down my body, the nipples of both women became harder still while their fingers brushed mine while they rubbed it.</p> <p>"Let's try it," the woman said softly, moving her hands upwards and cupping and stroking me under my briefs.</p> <p>"It can't be that bad," the woman countered with a wink as she started to move her finger along my cock.</p> <p>She suddenly stopped and climbed towards the bed, while I got up to follow. Their lips were moving up and down my briefs, their hands moving around my thighs. I had been feeling the same from the other pair before, but suddenly realized that we had not seen them. They both took the elastic of my briefs just below my cock in their hands, then slowly, gently, pulled down.</p> <p>"Looks like we'll have to keep it down, though," the woman said as she pulled my briefs down, exposing my fully erect cock in the process.</p> <p>She continued to remove my briefs, which quickly became damp with my excitement and my pre-cum. Both women slowly moved my briefs down over my erect cock with their soft, warm hands, while I watched them looking at me with wonder and wonder.</p> <p>"Yeah," the woman said with a smile. "Let's take off our clothes."</p> <p>The other woman removed her clothes, revealing her full soft tits, small waist, and her sexy ass. She was wearing a tight black bikini underneath, and her body was a sight to behold.</p> <p>The other blonde removed her clothes while the other woman started to massage my body. She got to her knees, then stood up and started to rub and kiss her way up my body. When our breasts were touching, she moved her hands down my body until they were directly beneath my cock.</p> <p>She started slowly rubbing her hands all over my body, her fingertips lightly trailing over my nipples. The same sensations of touch ran through my body from her hands all over from my cock to my cock. Slowly, and around my balls.</p> <p></p> <p>"Can you can feel us to feel," she continued to pleasure for you feel you."</p> <p>feel you as you When</p> <p>Feel you as you</p> <p>(while you both of you like feel. She started touching. I can feel can</p> <p>Can feel like</p> <p></p> <p>Feel she can feel for—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
