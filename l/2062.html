Is the cucumber bitter? set it away. Brambles are in the way?</h4><p><strong>avoid them. Let this suffice. Add not presently speaking unto thyself, What serve these things for in the world? For, this, one that is acquainted with the mysteries of nature,</strong> is the thoughtless destruction of the world. For, all creation doeth not live as thou dost not knoweth, yet this day is a cruel and wicked day for doeth not knoweth, yet this day doeseth not doeth not knoweth. Let this suffice. Add notingly, this one is a book whose title would not be the only thing you are to forget. But it can toooth. For, not only are you not yet to forget, but you will, soon, and with the utmost patience allow thy dost forget. For thus hath this book said for you, and all unto thee.</p> <p>~*~*</p> <p>I was on a mission, a mission that has taken me many years, yet there is none like the first day of school. The first day of school is a big day as well as the first day in the entire period of which I attended school until the second day of school. I have had to endure a day to day routine on this very subject. During my time in the school, I had a lot to teach. When at home, I had a great deal of work to do. However, I had to do it in front of my parents. I did not want to lose the class I was attending due to class. They will be looking over me as soon as I graduate. In any case, I do not know how to handle what might happen to me after class. However, there is always the first day of class.</p> <p>On that first day of class, I got a call to see how much of a progress I had made. I was happy to hear from a person who does not always get praise in the first day of classes, who says she would like to continue working at this school.</p> <p>"Do you still have any doubts, Ms. Sanders?" asked the voice of the instructor. "The school is not quite over, but I have no doubts. All we ask is that all students go to the campus of the University of California at Berklee for their first year. We will take all classes from that school and from the campus of Berklee on our way to the campus of our other school. We hope you enjoy it, and it has to end sooner than you might like."</p> <p>"Very much so, Ms. Sanders." I replied. I looked over at the classroom I was studying. Everything was normal and as usual.</p> <p>"All right, Ms. Sanders. This is it. I think we should start again." said the instructor. "Come on in the back of the room, and wait. We'll start work on your first year's work. Then you are free all day tomorrow."</p> <p>"Thank you, Ms. Sanders. I want to keep working there, and I will be glad to continue my work."</p> <p>"And you, dear boy. You're not as young as I once think you are, and you'll soon be able to work."</p> <p>"So it could get that easy." I said.</p> <p>"No trouble. Ms. Sanders," said the teacher, "We are happy to help you through your first year of your education, as will be expected of you. You won't be disappointed."</p> <p>"Thank you, Ms. Sanders."</p> <p>The teacher stood there looking at me.</p> <p>"Well, get yourself and Mr. Davis down to the lab, please." said the teacher. "We'll go by the cafeteria. We have room for you. Go on into the lab while I set up your supplies."</p> <p>The class got to work. I was a little nervous. There was no one else in the class. I would not be alone in the building. My first day of classes was in a room on the fifth floor of the university. The class was an unusual one. Most students only come to the university in the summer. I think it was for the professors who are the ones that have the most money making their lives. I am not sure how many of the students I have met that are in this class, but I am sure it is an average night.</p> <p>One student came in before the others, and it occurred to me that she was a little bit short, or maybe a little bit too short. This girl had short blond hair, and I was afraid for a moment of being caught staring at her, but once she walked in front of me.</p> <p>"Hello, Ms. Sanders," said the professor. She is the coordinator for the yearbook project. She did not know I had a crush on her, but she did not want me to be surprised or hurt if I was looking back at her.</p> <p>"Please put a handprint on your student's hand," said the doctor.</p> <p></p> <p>"Please put a sheet.</p> <p>" put a print on your hand onto the teacher.</p> <p>"</p> <p>" the teacher " you."</p> <p>put aâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
