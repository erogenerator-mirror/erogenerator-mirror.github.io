Frank Baum </h3><h4>Introduction</h4><p><strong>Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal. The</strong> most amazing thing, however, is the first time a woman had sex with a man who didn't know how to use it. (No wonder there's really nothing to it!) Of course, it didn't help that the father of all those stories would be someone who thought that such things existed, of course. But the first time I fucked somebody was to be with the woman of my dreams. I wasn't the least bit surprised by what was about to occur to me.</p> <p>There, I lay on my back, staring into a sea of emerald-green, white-feathered eyes while she bent over me and began to lick my cock, working its full length back and forth while her hands caressed me and her tongue danced across my shaft. I put my hand to her shoulder for support as, in spite of the warm water, I saw her mouth descend onto me, the tip of my cock passing her lips and she started to bob up and down, the suction and speed increasing as her lips sealed around me. As the pleasure began to reach an overwhelming degree, I felt the sensation of her tongue inside her, licking around and teasing, but no effort was made to take it back into her mouth. The sensation was overwhelming and I had to move my hand to her soft waist to keep us in good contact.</p> <p>I heard her whisper into my ear, "I want to suck you until your come, please." I wanted to say, "Please, I want to suck you just as much as you want me to suck you." But, I didn't want this to end. Not until I knew that everything felt so right that, if I told her, she wouldn't be disappointed. I tried to hold back for her, but then it was impossible. There was too much to keep going, and I knew I couldn't last much longer.</p> <p>Her lips left my shaft and I felt them trailing down to the base where, between her lips, I felt something metallic against the head of my cock. She began to press it downward slowly, using the back of her hand to guide the head. Suddenly, she was taking my cock into her mouth and bobbing up and down on me at the same speed she was sucking me, which, as I recall, was quite effective. Her hand on me felt amazing all over as it moved up and down its length with an incredible tightness. It was an odd sensation, but worth it as I began to lose control. Her lips slipped further down, feeling the head slide into the opening of her mouth and then she was sucking me right back down, feeling every ridge under the thick head as the shaft slid into her mouth. With one swift motion, she took my entire shaft inside, her hand wrapping around it and her lips pressing against the bottom of it as she went. I swear it took a minute for me to come even though I could feel it coming from somewhere. My body shook and shook and the first wave of orgasm came crashing on me in waves, shaking in every cell of my body. As well as it seemed, I felt her sucking on me deep inside for a long time as she continued to stroke me. Finally, while still sucking and stroking me, she released me. I felt a wave of electricity run through me from being so intimately connected with her to her, causing my whole body to quake and shiver and I fell back on the bed, my head resting on the pillow as a huge, ecstatic smile crossed over my face.</p> <p>With a wave of regret, I got up and left that hot tub, but then realized that the water only had a little blue streak running it, like a waterfall. It was a warm summer night and it was a nice day to be on the beach after all those years without a girlfriend. Then I thought of the other night, when I'd found my first lover and he'd sucked and fucked my sweet, sweet girl. The fantasy of the girl sucking the boy's cock had been incredible but it had never really presented itself quite like this. But, she had sucked, fucked and came, and so had her next boyfriend. I wasn't going to let it get that far. And then there's the other night with her, when those tight panties caught my eye.</p> <p>I stripped out of my clothes and jumped in the pool, but even as hot water cascaded down over me I could feel my body betraying me. I felt like a girl who'd been caught in the act of having sex with someone else and was about to tell her that they couldn't do it, even if it meant having to watch her get fucked by a man she thought was just a boy she really liked. I started to take off my bathing suit as the water was getting heavier and the pool was getting cooler, with the fact that there were a lot of naked people swimming around. It was time swimming naked people being naked in the whole country, and not nudity being just being all. I wasn't a matterâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
