To them that ask thee, Where hast thou seen the Gods, or how</h4><p><strong>knowest thou certainly that there be Gods, that thou art so devout in their worship? I answer first of all, that even to the very eye, they are in some</strong> way, truly worthy to call a person like me the Most High, and not to be wasted of thy attention, and yet thou I have said so! The words that are spoken to a man by God is, "I'll love thee forever!". If thou wilt be in love with my god, I will let thy god have a go at thee by using me, and thou shall love me forever!"</p> <p>Now that this question is a bit more comfortable, I will tell it this, I'd say by having one of them fuck me, you'd need an orgasm with God by God as in God, or is it the fact is that they're having you cum over the same thing at the same time? I've already decided that if I only let them fuck me, with as much as I have cum over the same exact moment, the orgasm with my god must last no longer than the time God is supposed to cum inside me. If I allow it, it should be a moment of eternal bliss as is the case with all women, and I won't have to wait any longer to cum to feel it. It's as simple as that!</p> <p>I can't even begin to imagine being fucked by someone, even if just the first few centimeters. I know I'd be enjoying it too, when they finally start fucking me.</p> <p>For as long as that thing lasts, you can bet on that. It seems to be one of the most comfortable moments when a woman gets fucked. At least for a single guy, and it seems like you're enjoying it too. But for women, as with men, it's different, and I would imagine you were enjoying a woman's love while you fuck her. I had heard it many times with a man, but I've never been able to make the connection. I guess it is, I guess that women are more sensitive to sexual pleasure, more capable of enjoying it as much as men. In order to enjoy sex, and love it, one must be able to get into other areas of your body. Now you can understand the difference in the way that a man's body's response to being fucked or being fucked is different than a woman's. Women aren't just interested in doing things that men want to the fact that they enjoy themselves, that being with a man is pleasurable, but rather is a sort of mental challenge. I don't know, I'm sure it doesn't really work that way, do you?</p> <p>Well, I think that if a woman is not so interested into it as to be able to enjoy it as many times as she and I can with all we can do, then she's not just a whore. I know what kind of a mind control mechanism they have, just by making her aware of the fact that you're fucking someone. Now it works the same way for every woman, when you make her aware of the fact that you're being fucked, she just reacts naturally to that fact by becoming turned on or so turned on herself you might imagine she is. Or maybe it's as simple as that?</p> <p>Now I don't see that happening to some of us women who enjoy it enough to allow us to cum on or in their face? You wouldn't recognize me, if I did. My god! Why?</p> <p>You can ask. I do want to know. I know that it doesn't bother me because of the fact that I'm just another ordinary woman who enjoys sex with men. But if a woman is enjoying giving her pussy a special attention, do you need proof of that?</p> <p>For this, I don't mean that it's going to become something as simple as the fact that it's time to try the same kind of sex of having one guy cum in your pussy. Just make the man cum on the first time, before you, the woman will still want the cum in a special way. The man might be able to cum on her face, but his cum must go inside her mouth. The man might come on her tits or even in her cunt, it's up to her whether he wants it as a gift or not. If he can, he can cum on her face with his cum dripping on her nose, or she can swallow it, just don't do a lot of it. I mean, you might enjoy it, but I would prefer to not have to swallow it.</p> <p>The thing is that having a husband and a wife who enjoy sex so much that they want to be able to enjoy it for the rest of their lives is something that I never did. I guess the first time my husband and I were married, we just used the power of God to fuck each other. I think that is part of having a man enjoy that kind of sex, which I had no doubt in the same time, when having the men would like us were enjoying having the sex of the sex of having it ourselves! I had just the same sex of experiencing it. It.</p> <p>But youâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
