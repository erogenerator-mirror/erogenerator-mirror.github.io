The sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then suddenly heavy</strong> fog hung heavily over the sky. The sun was a heavy grey, and the air was like clouds of smoke. The day was gorgeous. It was like a breeze passing through us - our breath. The heat of the sunny day gave off a warm wind which ran in circles all around us as a sign of the days pleasures of the North.</p> <p>Then there was an all too familiar smell of a perfume which filled the room with a sweet, masculine odour of spring flowers and honeysuckle.</p> <p>The smell was not unlike vanilla...</p> <p>'This is it' I said with a sudden thought. I was about to take possession of this beautiful autumn night, and the scent was my lover. And now, with her in my arms the fragrance was that of flowers.</p> <p>'Oh' I added in my head, 'this will be the sweetest summer I have experienced in years'</p> <p>And so we did.</p> <p>My hand crept to her belly, and I gently caressed her smooth belly. It moved slowly upwards, moving over the swell of her breasts which were firm and perky. My mind was filled with anticipation and my hand moved slowly downwards.</p> <p>And then I got hold of the soft white panties where the fabric of panties meet in the small groove of her sex. The light hair of her neatly trimmed bush was visible between the thin material of the panties. She was absolutely beautiful...</p> <p>I was about to place her panties on and remove them; they were completely unnecessary. This will be fun! How would I tell a shy girl her panties were on? No doubt she would blush.</p> <p>'No', I promised, 'You can do that yourself'</p> <p>I took the panties and placed them over her panties. They were moist and beautiful. I held them against my face to inhale her odour deeply. Then I looked inside her panties and saw the moistness. It was a delicate aroma which made me feel so warm in my arms.</p> <p>'What's the smell' I said, taking off my blouse to remove my skirt. And then I was in a deep sleep, having a good, relaxing sleep.</p> <p>I don't know what possessed me to do such a thing. I could not believe that it happened in that instant. The whole morning had been filled with such vivid memories... of having sex once again. I had become aroused by the sight. But this time, I was feeling more guilty than embarrassed. I did not know what to do about it, and I felt ashamed. I could not move my body to the right position.</p> <p>After a bit, I had found my head on the sofa chair and looked at her. She was looking at me quite dreamily, and I was having a great time doing that with her.</p> <p>'Ohh, it's nice'</p> <p>I agreed. For she was looking at me through the eyes of a beautiful woman. She was so soft and smooth...</p> <p>'Oh' I uttered my mind, 'Yes, it is very nice to sleep in a man's arms...'</p> <p>'I see'</p> <p>'Yes...' I replied and smiled. I didn't know at that instant about whether I was being sincere or not. How could I know that I was dreaming about her? I didn't know a thing about her beyond her beauty and her smell, but it might have been.</p> <p>Soon after that, she was wearing a sleeveless shirt which showed the top of her bellybutton to me. She wore sleeveless trousers with a low cut to allow the waistband of her trousers to be just below the breasts. This shirt was also transparent, and had very wide buttons button. Even above, it was transparent - it was really transparent!</p> <p>She was sitting by me and took my hand. We hugged. As we hugged, her breasts pressed against my chest and I was hugging her, enjoying the feel of her breasts against my chest. She was feeling very warm. Her bare breast rubbed against my arm which made me shiver with excitement.</p> <p>I told her she was beautiful. She said so and I was not being too sincere. So I asked her to remove my blouse. She took and took it, and without saying anything she took it off. I was not looking at her, but looked at the beautiful white skin of her back. The thin white fabric showed her back so well - if I thought it all white!</p> <p>'Do you like me?' she asked. Her question caught me off guard a bit.</p> <p>'No, not at all' I replied, 'I am really flattered'. It seemed like my mind was getting more confused than my body. I could have anticipated. in this moment. I said this. . a bit. her. was all of silence.</p> <p>, 'you too' and we both of course I was getting more than saying, . I am very muchâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
