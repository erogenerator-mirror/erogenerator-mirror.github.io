The night had been very wet: large pools</strong>, big crowds; and some of the brightest stars in the Milky Way; and there was a rain shower.</p> <p>Heather and the girls had been looking out the window when the lightning flashed. Heather's heart fluttered. "Wow," she exclaimed, "that was awesome." She hadn't meant it to be a romantic moment. This was exactly where she wanted to be: in bed with her brother.</p> <p>The rain fell harder. "You ready yet," he asked. He was still wearing a pair of swim trunks. As Heather's eyes adjusted to the bright light, she realized there was a big tent in his swim trunks. "It looks like we made a mess," she thought. She was still in her high school gym clothes. He took her at her word and went to her bed. He laid on her bed and cuddled between her legs.</p> <p>"I've missed you, Heather," he said. His arm was around her shoulders and his hand went up and down over her breasts. She was content with this comfort. After a while of this, she put her hands down the front of his swim trunks and pulled them down. His cock sprang out, hard as a rock, sticking out from inside his boxers.</p> <p>As if it had a mind of its own, it pressed against her inner folds, and he gently rubbed it up and down. Her arms went up around his neck and her legs opened for him. He moved his fingers to her clit and gently rubbed it. He slipped his index finger inside her pussy and she gasped, "Oh God," when he rubbed her clit in a gentle way. Now he added a second finger. He pushed her clit up, between his thumb and the index finger. At the angle his fingers were, they seemed perfect.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she said, "I need more."</p> <p>"You need me to make you happy, too," he teased with his finger moving between her pussy lips. She pushed his hand away as if it was ice cream and gave him a wicked grin. "Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Oh God," she replied, "I'm ready." She reached down and touched his cock. It was throbbing and was oozing pre-cum. She took off her thong. She wanted to feel his naked cock in her hand. She bent from the waist and kissed his cock, which sprang to life as soon as the tongue touched it. She put her left hand on his chest, and started fingering her pussy, rubbing his shaft with her thumb, while massaging his balls. She felt him thrusting against her hand. "It's coming," she thought.</p> <p>"Oh, it's there," he said, with a groan. He came in her hand, his cum pouring out of him.</p> <p>She looked up at him and saw a big smile and a little grin, from which he didn't blink. With his cock still in her hand, Heather leaned over and kissed him. "Merry Christmas," she whispered. She let his cock slide out of her hand. He lay on his back, and she crawled up, straddling him. He put his hands on her breasts. "What are you doing? I want to go again, but..."</p> <p>"Just let me enjoy kissing you," Heather said.</p> <p>"Can you do it any better? I love being with you. I could stay like this forever." He kissed her on her mouth. This time they kissed passionately. He felt her breasts pressing against his chest. Her leg was just about him. Heather's hand came up and caressed his cock. With her other hand, she put his cock between herself and down her stomach. He put his hand up her skirt. He could feel her wetness. She guided him in. When he slid into her she screamed, "Yes! Oh, God, Oh, God."</p> <p>"Are you okay?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes!" she said.</p> <p>Heather continued moving her body up and down, up and down.</p> <p>Heather felt him get hard. She wanted him. She wanted him so badly. Her legs were almost wrapped around him, and she was rubbing her clit against him. As he slowly moved his hips up and down, Heather could feel his cock move in and out of her as well. It was getting harder.</p> <p>"Take your clothes off, Heather," he told her. He held her hips and pulled her up to him. She put her hands under her breasts, and he pulled them downward. She was on a downward flight; he was on the downward march. Her. She was sitting on the downward. She was on the downward. She sat.</p> <p></p> <p>The downward was on the up, she was just.</p> <p>the he was his up. The downward flight. a down.</p> <p>they were the flight.
