The news was as though she was the heroine of the moment as she marched to Mr. Rowland's apartment and made it her destination in life.</p> <p>Now at the wedding chapel, Miss Ferrars was more than happy to be the Maid of Honor. As she walked around the reception hall, she tried to remain composed while a handsome young man in his early 30's stood in her place.</p> <p>Miss Ferrars stopped in front of Mr. Rowland and began a polite exchange. "So, did we have a good time, Mr. Rowland?"</p> <p>"Miss Ferrars, the wedding is today," Mr. Rowland stated.</p> <p>"It was wonderful. Where is that little place we were on our honeymoon?"</p> <p>"We have been in a long engagement Hall of Fame trip," he responded with a smile.</p> <p>"We are in a long marriage!"</p> <p>"What will be yours forever will be mine," he countered. "My name is Rowland Rowland, by the way." Miss Ferrars didn't speak English so much so that she could not understand the words. "Mr. Rowland, is it all right if I ask you to marry me at the altar?"</p> <p>Mr. Rowland raised his head, smiled and shook his head no. To his credit, Rowland held steady and said only, "Yes. Of course."</p> <p>Miss Ferrars made the mistake of reaching out for his hand, saying, "Thank you for saying so."</p> <p>Rowland continued to smile and said, "That's not to say we haven't danced for a while."</p> <p>The rehearsal started without a word being said, a smile forming to Rowland's smile, Miss Ferrars' smile and his face with only the sound of the piano and a note of her soft, feminine song "Hello Miss Ferrars." The wedding was the beginning of the year, and Miss Ferrars and Mr. Rowland wanted to make love forever so they could marry. Miss Ferrars and Mr. Rowland could hardly talk, and Miss Ferrars wanted to know only the best things about each other.</p> <p>Miss Ferrars' wedding night was memorable, and her husband never complained that they were never going to have children, even though he wanted the same thing. After a while, their passion for each other grew beyond anything he had ever felt in his life.</p> <p>The wedding night was just another day in their lives. There was nothing more they could have done to make the wedding memorable. The best part of the wedding was that Miss Ferrars was the most beautiful woman in the world and he had never been more happy.</p> <p>After that night in their home, they made love in every room of their home as much as they made love in their livesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
