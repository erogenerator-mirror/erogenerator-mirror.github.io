He that sinneth, sinneth unto himself. He that is unjust, hurts</h4><p><strong>himself, in that he makes himself worse than he was before. Not he only that committeth, but he also that omitteth something, is oftentimes unjust.</strong></p> <p>That's when it finally started to feel like he wasn't going to fuck her. He needed to fuck her, or she wouldn't care if he fucked her. She'd care if he fucked her right from her pussy. But it wouldn't feel right. It started to hurt. A little to his surprise, she'd even be willing to give it a shot, like a shot glass.</p> <p>It didn't really hurt if he got a few inches inside her. As soon as she wrapped her legs around his body, he was sure his cock would slip through the slit in her panties. He hoped not. What if she told him to get out? Not her vagina, it wouldn't even be necessary. Not with the way her pussy was so tight. It would be the equivalent of going to hell in a hand basket. He didn't know how she'd react, if she'd just say, "fuck me!"</p> <p>If she did, she was already in his apartment and waiting to go through with it. If she did, she was asking for it. He was still a little unsure of how this was going to be to her, and so was she. They both wanted this to happen. Their lives were such things.</p> <p>Then he just started to think she wouldn't mind. She'd probably be just as willing as he was to just stick his cock in her and fuck. That was a really good thing. He could've thought of her as more than just a little sexual play thing, like they really did just fuck. Not just fuck, even if it was only with each other. He would've had to be careful not to take advantage of it. That would be the limit of this relationship.</p> <p>When he got that first thought out of his head, he was stunned. That thought made him wonder what that taste tasted like. Not that he really needed to know what a taste tasted like. Just as long as it seemed like her lips were around his cock.</p> <p>He couldn't think of anything else. This wasn't her pussy. He just wanted to slide his cock into her. He didn't care how she might feel about all of this, even if it actually did feel exactly what he needed it to feel like. He didn't care if he'd hurt her. He didn't care that he had to be careful to not be too rough, even if he did have to be. His cock was so hard he felt sore, if not swollen.</p> <p>He held out as long as he could before he finally felt his own prick getting bigger and feeling tighter than ever. He held it. If her lips could feel a little different, then he sure could feel a lot different as well. Maybe if the whole time he was just holding his cock, it only felt weird because his cock felt tight. Maybe it wasn't much different. There was no pain that he could feel, in or out of his cock. But it felt.</p> <p>He couldn't remember when it felt all that different, but it just felt right. He felt so connected to her he couldn't feel anything but their bodies, the intimacy they were in, and the intimacy she was in. He felt like he was connecting with her that way. And in some small way the most important part of the whole weekend would be fucking her. It felt perfect right away. No, not perfect, just perfect.</p> <p>For a moment the world just seemed to just slip out of focus. Nothing could have happened, even if there never really would have. They'd just made love. They just fucked. They just fucked for a while. They just fucked, in a way that no one could ever be satisfied with. No, not forever either. Maybe they could still be together as much as they wanted to be. But this weekend, something else that felt so perfect, could never be that perfect again. He had to stop this.</p> <p>He could go to hell. There was no way he could keep this from happening. He looked at her. She was still looking at the wall. Her arms and legs still wrapped around him. He could feel her heart pounding in her chest. She looked at nothing. In spite of his confusion, he felt warmth for her again. He felt an undeniable connection. He couldn't describe it or how it felt. It seemed somehow different than the way the other guys were looking at her.</p> <p>This was just sex. Nothing else had ever felt that different than that. If something really was going to happen, he needed to try.</p> <p>But as long as this felt weird or painful between them, it didn't feel that different. He couldn't tell whether they were still in love, if they were still connected, and if it never did feel like something other people who was different. It was just a new. Just that, sex didn't matter. If they were a different. The idea couldn't matter. It was just was something that people made upâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
