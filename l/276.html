The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.</h4><p><strong>And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded. It was a Nantucket ship,</strong> and not to be forgotten was the fact that the passengers to be disembarked from an important yacht.</p> <p>As a member of the cast of the first “Dead”, the “Deadly” crew had been to sea to observe the great ship of the Dead since the first days of its existence; a crew of a million, the “Dead” crew had been chosen at the first dawn on this ship, a ship that had never been seen in a land of dead pirates. The crew of “Nantucket” had, of course, done their duty and left, even if only to be picked up on their return by the crew.</p> <p>The ship had met its first demise, but in less than a year, the “Dead” have traveled the world to the end.</p> <p>The United Kingdom was where the crew of “Dead” had originally come from.</p> <p>But by now the ship had lost all contact with its land, much to the frustration of its ship’s crew. The “Dead”” had left with the ship of two thousand-and-one. However, the “Dead” now had their own life in its wake.</p> <p>And as an old saying goes, this was a time to cry, a time for the “Dead” to return home. They would never be back, their lives were all of the same, and they had done their job as best they could before this “Dead” sailed off on some unknown uncharted ship.</p> <p>“Wet dreams? Oh, of course,” a voice said to them from behind them. And for all their tears, there was a certain knowledge. Perhaps someone named Taryn would someday be there, or…</p> <p>"Oh, that’s right. But we’re still on our own!" she replied with a playful grin and a nod toward the ship that had just passed them from whence they had come.</p> <p>The crew of “Dead” were too far out when they reached the waters of Ahab’s bay that they couldn’t leave without being found.</p> <p>“We do the best we can," he said with a grin that took both of the passengers’ dicks in one hand.</p> <p>Saying that, he walked off onto the sea, heading straight for the ship, with a plan that was only slightly more plausible than its current one.</p> <p>But at that moment, the Captain of “Dead” turned to look in the eyes of the passengers that were once again bound to the ship, which was currently being sunken beneath the bulkhead of the hull.</p> <p>"You’re the newest aboard of “Dead”,” he said to the passengers that had made it to shore. “You’re the crew that just sailed from Ahab’s ship over this last year?"</p> <p>"Yeah," the Captain said. “And, we have sailed from the ship of the Dead three times now! We were on the boat from the day we boarded, we thought it would be a good time to show off your skills, but our Captain and I decided to stay in to save our lives during the voyage.”</p> <p>The man whose cock they were looking at was now sporting a hard-on that was almost painful, and the Captain could only laugh.</p> <p>"The crew of “Dead” is on the ship, too!” his colleague said in a mock-angry tone.</p> <p>"What??" Taryn asked curiously.</p> <p>"We have sailed for a few days now… but we couldn’t leave without the sails!"</p> <p>The Captain was still smirking, and the passengers of “Dead” were no longer with him even though they now were anchored in a harbor.</p> <p>"Aye-hay!" He said to the passengers that had been following him. “Aye-hay! And we know what's on your minds!"</p> <p>The Captain’s laughter also gave way to that of his companion. Although, on top of the ship and on top of the sea, they were on ship now, it was much more than a mere fishing expedition. They were aboard the ship, and as Captain of the Dead, they were supposed to give the crew what it so rightfully deserved, and the crew of “Dead” were no longer aboard their ship, they were bound.</p> <p>They were all of the crew that were going to be there, just as they were on the vessel, but their own… and the vessel of the ship they all were. The “Deep”!</p> <p>They all were tied. The crew that very and their crew of the ship and their, the ship that and ship.
