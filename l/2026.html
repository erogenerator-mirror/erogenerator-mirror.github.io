When thou art hard to be stirred up and awaked out of thy sleep,</h4><p><strong>admonish thyself and call to mind, that, to perform actions tending to the common good is that which thine own proper constitution, and that which the nature of man do</strong> not thus-freed, should be of a higher, better quality, and not be so often.</p> <p>He put all his strength into making me want to be there. He pulled my head to him and thrust in, making me gasp and cry out, a sound that was his encouragement, a promise of pleasure, and even pleasure, as he held my head in his hands. He let me breathe, and made me want him to take more, making me want those things, wanting me to feel how his hardness filled me, to feel how much I could stretch out of the bed and enjoy it.</p> <p>He kissed me hard. I could not tell what kind of pressure that would be, but I could not tell how it would be from him. I could not tell how strong a man he was, how much he made me feel. I felt him throb. He thrust. He pulled so hard that he almost hurt.</p> <p>When I had given myself to him completely without protest, I knew I was ready for him. I wanted to feel it. I needed something. I need to be close to him, to feel his body close with mine on mine.</p> <p>He fucked me again, and I moaned with my lips stretched tight, wanting him on me, feeling my wet, wet body slide over him. He held himself deep inside, taking me and enjoying me completely. He kissed me hard, but did not enter, not in any way, not one part of my body, not one point. I wanted everything he was doing to me. My eyes, my head, my lips, my body. He fucked me in and out, so hard he was almost painful, so hard I could see the shape of his head in the tightness of my pubic hair. He pulled on my hair, and kissed me roughly.</p> <p>One of his hands found my wet pussy, and he found my clit. I shuddered, wanting to touch him, to make him feel how hard he fucked me, how deep he went, how deep he pushed me up my body, how much he wanted to possess me, use me, make me his and know how he made me feel.</p> <p>I was getting closer, too, and the pace was becoming faster and faster. When he took his mouth from mine to suck my nipples, that is when I came, cumming hard on his fingers he thrust in me, coming more deeply than I could have imagined would be possible, more than I could have imagined or expected him to make me love him, come to love me in all the ways I had never felt.</p> <p>The pleasure he'd made me feel for him was an added pleasure I wanted him to accept, and love, because I did.</p> <p>We lay together in his bed. We made love in his bed, I fucked him.</p> <p>He came over me, my body, my face, my body. We kissed. My body was exhausted. He rolled away.</p> <p>He was gone.</p> <p>I was in his bed, lying alone and naked, my legs wide apart, my clit hard, poking and hard against the fabric of his nightgown, his body so close to mine, and our bodies touching. It felt like there was something more, something greater in my heart I wanted him to come to me, to feel me, to make me his and his alone, and to love and to love and to love and to make me his.</p> <p>The sound of his voice startled me.</p> <p>"I need you!"</p> <p>I wanted him so much when he left me all those years ago, I needed him desperately, I wanted him, and to see him again. I wanted him, that night we had it, for now, even if that night never returned. I needed to feel him, to feel him for real.</p> <p>We had to make love, but not just fuck, although I knew that would be the right thing to do, because, in a way, that was how he wanted to make love to me. That he made me love him, make me love him, make me look at him, make me feel the way he made my body happy.</p> <p>We had to make love, I had to make him happy, to feel him come to me, to make me feel his body all over me, make me feel his hardness and his hardness all over me.</p> <p>We had to do it one night, or I would not be able to find him in a day's time. I had to make love to him. In the day, when you cannot feel the passion of passion, the passion of wanting, being loved because you want to be loved, the passion of love, the passion of loving to feel the feelings you fill your eyes when your lust in your gaze, you are feeling it is with lust.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>That isâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
