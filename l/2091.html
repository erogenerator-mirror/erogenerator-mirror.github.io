The opening was ready, waiting, ready...</p> <p>She opened her thighs. they parted wider for him and, she cried, he moved his cock on her sex and entered. She cried in a soft, soft voice, "ohhhhhs..." and moved like an otter, with the fingers of her left hand, the thumb of her right hand on her sex.</p> <p>He took his cock a little bit higher and she took her fingers from her vagina and she inserted it inside inside her vagina.</p> <p>Her fingers were wet and he fucked her as the hands of her eyes were on his face and on the fingers of her cunt</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh, Ahhhhh, Ahhhhhhhhhh"...</p> <p>She was lying there, at last, her head on a pillow, her eyes closed, her mouth open and he was in a tight grip around her opening, pulling and pushing it as he went. She closed her eyes, opened her mouth and he fucked her as he pushed it inside. He was still holding his cock inside her, pushing it inside her.
