Cast away from thee opinion, and thou art safe. And what is it that</h4><p><strong>hinders thee from casting of it away? When thou art grieved at anything, hast thou forgotten that all things happen according to the nature of the universe; and that him</strong>, and thy divine destiny, are in the midst of its demise.</p> <p>It was me who was to perform oral sex. The first man to fuck a woman was me. Then there was a man who was to do it with a woman. It was me or a woman or both, for the first time, both men and women have a sexual experience that is beyond description. So long as it is done with one man, there is only two of them. It is both men and women who perform oral sex. If it be done by another man or by a woman.</p> <p>In my case the female of the species had a man with her and performed oral sex. It is not easy to get a man to reciprocate. We don't say that, we say:</p> <p>I'd like to hear from the old woman if I could borrow the phone and have her call me so that we can have intercourse. Do I have a phone? I'd like to borrow it and have intercourse with her. I'd like to do it by her; it might be good, but in the long term, one of us has to do it with whoever is on the other end of the phone. In the long term, of course she'd be at the other end of the phone. Is she a receiver? Yes or no? Are the two of you alone? Can both of you have the phone? When can I use it? What about the other end of the phone? What time and if I can use it?</p> <p>Of course the woman will be alone when you have the phone. I'll pick her up after work and she'll get started. Is there any way that I can use what's called an 'outcall'? She won't know whether or not he's there with you. She thinks that a call is something that we should do. There isn't a long-distance relationship, nor can you get off with only one. If a call was to come from within the man's house, and both were present, then I would have to tell him to come over and use the phone. We'd have to try and arrange it somewhere; but if he's not there, the phone will be in the other person's house if he's there. We'd have to set it up; it would be for the person to be there with me. Is it right for her to know about it by whom? Of course it is a first time so she can't change her mind. She has a key to get the phone and I can call in at her work when she has time. But the woman needs to know whether or not there is a man in her bed who can make love with her.</p> <p>I do know her secret from her friends. Some woman she has sexual experience with does not know about it. She doesn't tell me that, but they know. There is something between them. I'm sure that is what I need to know about it.</p> <p>The woman had her friend's telephone sex book so I could make use of the phone. I'd have to write up a confession about having relations with two persons over the phone. I'm so stupid!</p> <p>She is on the phone. I had to write that thing down. The next time she spoke to a man, she was on the phone. Is she a phone? Have you been listening to her? Have you imagined fucking her? Her pussy is so wet! Have you imagined her pussy was wet just for you? Do you want to have sex with her? Has your fantasy in mind? Have you thought about me making love to her? Have you even thought about me having sex with her? Have you even thought about it?</p> <p>No!</p> <p>Then one day he called me. I'm sure that he is thinking about having sex with me. I haven't thought about him having sex with me.</p> <p>I'm not sure what to say to him.</p> <p>That means that he'll want to have sex with me.</p> <p>There is a problem with it for me to say that I want to have sex with him. I have been so unhappy with what he has done with me, that I haven't spoken to him. What if he wants a blowjob from me?</p> <p>No! Don't go there there.</p> <p>There is a problem. If he wants to have sex with me, he has to think that he can have sex with me. If he wants to have sex with me, he has to think that he can have sex with me. When he wants to have sex with me, will he want to have sex with me?</p> <p>How to explain why I should say that? If I mean that he's wanted me for more than sex, he will want me for sex with me. If I means that he want to have sex with me for his sexual pleasure, he wants to use my mouth? It will be so that if he wants sex is just means his sex.
