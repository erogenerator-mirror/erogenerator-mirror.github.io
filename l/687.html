Within four years he had paid off all his</strong> debts, moved their mother and sister in a marriage on a trip abroad while his wife was in law school, and was in business one day a millionaire. In short, he had made the most of it while he was there as a mercenary force. But then Nicholas decided to retire.</p> <p>Nicholas inherited his father's fortune as a private investigator and after he retired he was allowed to do almost everything he cared to. He spent the majority of his time working for various businesses and organizations, but he kept the occasional stipend offered. This gave Nicholas the opportunity of frequenting the most expensive restaurants and hotels in the city with rich family members and relatives. Some of these encounters proved fruitful, but Nicholas was a fairly short lived individual.</p> <p>Nicholas wasn't in any kind of financial hardship at the time. He was living with a well regarded middle class family with two sons and his own two daughters. He liked his family too.</p> <p>Nicholas enjoyed being married to his mother when they were together and he began to enjoy some of his business in his marriage. His sex life began to improve though. In fact it was only then after his wife died and he was left to his work.</p> <p>Nicholas enjoyed his company with other older couples. He was happy with his older sons as well. The boys liked to play in his lap. Often he got turned on as he was fondling the boys with his hands.</p> <p>He even took one boy into the spare bedroom at times while fucking the young one. One time he fucked one boy before letting another boy fuck him at every opportunity. A while ago he had an affair with a woman near his own age but her son was only nineteen.</p> <p>Nicholas knew that some people had problems with sex. Some might think that sex itself is dirty when it comes to love. He didn't believe in that. But he liked it. In fact, he liked the whole thing to start with his wife. He liked fucking other boys. But sex was an art, too, of a woman to be enjoyed.</p> <p>He did like fucking his wife's older son, as well as his younger daughters. The boy and son had just started fucking when a couple called the next door neighbor.</p> <p>"Nicholas honey, why isn't anyone coming over for dinner or anything? They might be busy so we better leave." They had made love in the hallway and it never did end. The neighbor had also called from the bathroom. Since that event in the living room one minute you were upstairs in the bedroom and the next minute you were in the living room. Nicholas knew what would be coming next.</p> <p>The guy was young and blond. He was a tall, slim man with medium brown hair and dark eyes. He smiled at Nicholas and said that he was married to Mrs. Sónya and she was engaged to him.</p> <p>"How long is this going on?" the man asked.</p> <p>"It should be four months," Nicholas replied.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" the man asked as he saw Nicholas approach the apartment and enter the apartment. He gave Nicholas a quick peck on the lips but as he looked at the boy he saw that the man wasn't wearing any of the clothes that the neighbor had described.</p> <p>"It's really nothing. She's your best-selling book. The sex story was actually written in English. And that story is really true. I know you were writing her some sort of a story, honey. Do you know how often she writes her stories?" The man stood there for a moment listening to Nicholas answer.</p> <p>"Sure," Nicholas answered.</p> <p>"Do you want to join our little club?" the man asked Nicholas.</p> <p>"Sure," Nicholas replied.</p> <p>"We are very rich people. We can pay you to help us out. We don't have a lot of money. But we will work hard for you. And we can give you more than you can imagine."</p> <p>Nicholas was amazed. He thought that he would be a millionaire when his wife was away. He really didn't mind paying attention to Nicholas and the boy.</p> <p>"Well, you can ask my father for some money, alright. I need a job after seeing him at college. We are very rich. I'd pay very well to do that."</p> <p>When Nicholas was eighteen he was ready to begin to become an aspiring writer. He would then become an avid writer after finishing his master's degree in business administration and teaching at the local junior college. He did so in many locations. He did so in the city with his friends. His most famous book was a long time ago. He'd been published in the most famous novel titled story in a time Nicholas was titled about a time being read by a time. He and the title of the title of his birth of a man of a mother.
