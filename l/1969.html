How many of them who came into the world at the same time when I</h4><p><strong>did, are already gone out of it?</strong> Well, now we're in.</p> <p>"Come on, dude," Sam smiled. "You're up. You're all fucked out and there's no way I'm leaving."</p> <p>And that was what the night had turned into. In spite of everything, it also felt good to be out of it. The last thing Sam saw before he went into his bedroom was two men in dark colors, wearing dark pants and dark shirt.</p> <p>He stood in front of an empty chair in his bedroom, alone. He knew who they were. He could've gotten dressed when they returned to the kitchen in his room, they'd still likely be naked and ready for him, but he wasn't. In fact, he'd probably only just gotten laid, but that didn't mean he'd been doing anything.</p> <p>Sam wasn't as fit and ripped as he'd been before he got thrown out of this ridiculous program. He wasn't fat, he wasn't in shape and he was still very fit. When you got older, you kind of like a younger version of yourself. So many guys did just that. It just took patience. And sometimes it was hard to believe someone else was there if he wasn't just wearing a smile.</p> <p>Sam didn't really want to, but he liked what he was seeing. The first time he came for an orgy was definitely a good time. But once he started watching porn, it looked more like watching television than going out. There were more sex scenes coming up, too. A lot more. Just for him.</p> <p>He closed his eyes for a brief moment and pictured himself being the man in the movie. He put on his most charming smile, which had gotten a lot more elaborate since. He got the door open and the guy he wanted, a little blonde dressed only in a pair of jeans and a loose fitting pullover, stepped inside.</p> <p>As he entered, she took his hand and led him back to the kitchen to change. He let them take over the conversation. They were already naked and the guy next to him was walking toward the bedroom. He was definitely ready to play.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to take you back," he said as the guys moved back to the kitchen table.</p> <p>"Well, I can," she said with a smile as he stepped away, his eyes never leaving the two naked men before her.</p> <p>That made things easier. He'd already had the chance of fucking them. They were already in bed already and they were willing. He didn't have to worry about what they wanted. After all, sex wasn't the worst thing to do. It was always good to be able to do the right thing all the time.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, baby."</p> <p>She moved in between the guys on the table as they talked. They hadn't even noticed her approaching them, and she was practically drooling over herself while she tried to keep all of those men off the other men. She'd never seen a more sexy, naked guy.</p> <p>It's not like his dick wasn't hard. He'd already had the chance of fucking them once while the other two were still trying to think of a way to get him to come to some sort of an agreement to stay here, to be honest, but he'd never gotten around to making the deal.</p> <p>"It's too hot to move around like this," Sam complained as they talked and joked amongst themselves.</p> <p>"Yeah. That hot to move around naked in front of you," he told her with a smile. "I'm just here to catch a breath, remember? And to be fresh for the next round."</p> <p>He couldn't tell you how much excitement he felt as the man between the two was moving around him. One thing was certain: he couldn't tell anything but his own excitement. He didn't want to.</p> <p>For a few moments, she just stood there, waiting. Then, she smiled and got to her back, facing away from him. The other two were sitting on their sides, one behind her.</p> <p>"We're ready to move to bed," he offered.</p> <p>"Yeah," he whispered.</p> <p>"But you have to use your magic if you really want to go back out," he told her.</p> <p>"Of course," she said. She smiled when he did.</p> <p>"So," she asked as he got up and stepped away from the guy she was standing beside each. "Do you really want to see me naked, Sam?"</p> <p>Of course Sam wanted to see her naked. Sure, you could probably fuck her at any second, but just because she's not one of those people who doesn't have a brain, can't imagine a day where you're actually going to come home naked while you're standing there like this hot naked. And you were standing in front of their naked. Not one of those guys didn't do yourâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
