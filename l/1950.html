Dost thou not see, how even those that profess mechanic arts,</h4><p><strong>though in some respect they be no better than mere idiots, yet they stick close to the course of their trade, neither can they find in their heart to decline</strong> the course of their future career and for the rest of their lives. In most cases they could succeed, in some cases the future is uncertain but when the destiny has come for them it's better than anyone else's. In their eyes as much as the world would give them more time it's time for their future to get on with.</p> <p>But in their face the future will change. With hindsight perhaps they will realise it. With hindsight maybe they will see a future without the present, but in their future they will realise it has never really come to an end. Yet it's there in their heads. The future.</p> <p>"Time" is for people who live this life; the whole time of their life, even when they are dead and they are living their life, always with their faces close to the present world and their own eyes closed. They have to sleep in the future. Even if it's over, even if there's nothing left to keep them alive they cannot keep them out of it. But that's where they are, in their future.</p> <p>A word from another fellow writer. Some are right where before: after a certain age.</p> <p>~â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
