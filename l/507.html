Soon after the Rostóvs came to Moscow</strong>, Pierre began to relax, and then found himself back on his wife’s couch. His wife had come home from work, and left her work bag in their bedroom. This was also when things began to become more physical. He had started with kissing her neck and ear, which led to him caressing her breasts. She responded by grinding her hips down on Paul's cock which he responded by pumping. She then slipped into a deep-throat, taking a lot of his cock in her throat. Paul was in heaven as he looked on, as his wife was giving him the best blowjob he’d ever had, and she had a mouth like a caveman’s. Her tongue stroking the sides of his cockhead, while the roof of her mouth ran up and down his shaft; he couldn’t last long after experiencing such pleasure.</p> <p>As she sucked harder, he moaned in delight. The feel of her lips wrapped around his pole, the softness of her face, and her tongue stroking him was enough to send him over the edge. He tried to keep his composure, but something gave him a weird thrill every time he had to cum. He couldn’t believe it though, but something inside of him told him his wife was the one he should be picturing, rather than feeling. He found himself grabbing a handful of the fluffy white robe that was wrapped around her. As he lifted the robe, it revealed her naked form for the first time.</p> <p>She gasped as she felt Paul thrusting himself deeper into her mouth. She sucked him harder, and stroked him faster, until she felt a gush of Paul’s cum in her mouth. She pulled his cock out of her mouth, and tasted Paul’s cum. Then she swallowed, tasting and swallowing until she had licked all his cum off her fingers.</p> <p>It was a great blowjob, and made their sex life that much better. As she knelt back on the couch as she had been so willingly before, Paul sat down next to her. He gave her a kiss that would make her knees weak in just a couple minutes; she returned it as he fondled her breasts and played with her pussy. Then he kissed her lips and neck, and whispered to her how much pleasure he caused and how much he enjoyed her. At this point Paul knew exactly what she was asking for, how much of a man she was, how much of a lover she was. He leaned in and kissed her again, a slow and sweet passionate kiss. The kiss turned into a second one, which led to one that was more intense, more demanding, as she responded and moved her tongue in Paul’s mouth. Paul’s hand began to rub her nipple while he played with her pussy, rubbing his face and lips with her breast; when he brought his hand down to rub her clitoris, she groaned in delight and pressed herself against his hand.</p> <p>The couple continued for a minute more as they both felt so lost in their passion, until it began to fade away. When they came to, they were completely at a loss for what to do, but Paul couldn’t help himself.</p> <p>“What’s up, babe? I’m still horny as a man,” he said.</p> <p>“Well, it’s too early to stop, just remember,” she responded. She grabbed his hand and placed it directly on her pussy. Paul’s fingers found her opening once and began working her inside out.</p> <p>They soon stopped, and Paul said, “Hey, if you keep that up you’ll ruin me.”</p> <p>“Yeah, but if we keep right on going, I won’t hold out so long. I’ll cum again, sooner or later,” she said. “We’ll have to stop sometime, you know that.” Paul’s hand slipped down and found her mound. He rubbed the top of it all over her clit; just the way she liked, to make it all wet. As he had known in his youth from his youth, he began to gently rub her clit. He wanted to make her orgasm the way she’d only fantasized she had: when she was feeling like it when he’d had an orgasm, like when he was doing her missionary from behind, she’d never felt anything like it. She was no longer sure whether she wanted it to last forever, that she wanted it, and was eager to give it all to her man. If she wanted it. he’d given her what she want. How? How he wanted and he would give and love, and want and do.</p> <p></p> <p>She wanted and loved. She wanted him she did. . Love.
