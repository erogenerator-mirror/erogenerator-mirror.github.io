And it wasn't only this Prophecy, like the prophecy of the Old Testament, that did it, given to me with the permission of God, who could do it and what else, in the Lord's name.</p> <p>I, too, could not have known, and only now I knew the meaning of it.</p> <p>I thought about having a penis in my mouth. I thought about how the word penis would describe it. I thought how it would come across a cock. I thought about having a penis. What was I thinking? I was imagining a pen, when I was in my apartment, when I was thinking, when I was thinking with my hand, and thinking with my penis. And just thinking, while thinking was like a fantasy, a real reality, a reality, it was the same while imagining it was a reality, a real reality, a real reality, a reality! (In truth, the actual real truth would be the same though, with some of those words said, the real truth might be something even as a figment of my imagination.) As I was thinking, again fantasizing something to imagine a penis, I imagined the penis entering my mouth. As I was imagining, I imagined being penetrated by a long penis; then, as I imagined the penis being entered by another penis, I imagined, too, what if my penis was longer? What if I wished I wanted to try it?</p> <p>'I never knew that, the first time I held a penis in my mouth,' was the thought, again recalling how I had imagined having something up my butt, wondering how it would feel, and how it would feel on my penis, in every conceivable position, where an erection should remain.</p> <p>'Oh, yes, I wish I was in the position, now. I wish I was in control of my penis,' was the thought, again recalling the thought of how I had thought about having a large penis in my own mouth and on my tongue.</p> <p>My penis, that's where it belonged, I had thought. It was where it belonged, on my tongue. Now, again, again, I had wondered what it would be? Was I imagining being in control of my penis? Would I be a person and do as I imagined, as I imagined? Would I be a person and do as I imagined?</p> <p>My penis, what a difference a difference! I could still have a penis, I might actually be a person! It would be as if I was going to write a letter to the woman of the next ten years. It would be much more realistic, when I wrote a letter to the woman of the next ten years, to say she was a woman, a woman and/or a man. It would be even more true if I was doing just that. The difference in my words would be, as is so often with fantasy literature, I was having fantasies.</p> <p>'I never knew that, the first time I held a penis in my mouth, imagining having a penis in my mouth,' my imagination, again thinking about being made love to by a penis. I could still not have a penis, because a penis is a penis to me.</p> <p>'Ah, but I know now,' my imagination, as I imagined having a penis in my mouth, a penis in my mouth.</p> <p>The first time that happened to me was just before my marriage, a very special night when I was 18, when there was a wedding, or a reception, and it was just a wedding or an event, where, in the year 2066, a new marriage was being organized and the families and relatives would be together and present, at an inbuilt church or in an early gravely cathedral. It was all a lot like the wedding and reception had been like, for me, it was as if this wedding was the beginning of something real, something in a very real place, something that I could not have imagined coming to pass, but, if I didn't know it yet, I had a feeling that it really didn't matter, as I would have the ability to do that now, had I not been so eager to know what was going on in my mind.</p> <p>At that dinner, I knew that there might be a real wedding or reception in the future, but I was not at the wedding or reception. I was not there, to know what was going on between me and my wife, or my bride-to-be, my wife—and my lover—my wife! That night was a special night, a night, a special night, so special to be as my wedding and special to me. And the night, too, the second day for any night, or, the wedding or future, when the or future—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
