Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled</strong> expression and his eyes staring at his friend's turgid penis.</p> <p>Aroused by the view, Nils felt his face heating and his muscles tighten, but he had no intention of giving in now. Sheesh, that's hot! They were going on a date. There was no going back. He wanted to push it and have it now and have it now and feel her naked beneath him. He needed to break the mood. Nils stood up, reached behind him and found her lacy bra. She was already back on her knees, sucking his friends cock while he fucked her cunt. Yes, they were going on a date!</p> <p>Then, she stood and, with her legs apart, pushed her panties down, leaving her cunt open and ready. She spread her legs and put her fingers deep inside, moving them round inside, feeling her clitoris swell out. She wanted to feel all of him! That was an invitation she knew there was no going back. She looked at her panties – she hadn't taken them out in ages – and then back to her husband. "Yes, I'm going to go into his office!" she thought. Then she realised he had put his hands on her shoulders and had pushed them hard down on to her ass. Oh, he was doing it again! Nils was going to have her ass fucked! She had to do something! The more she thought about it, the more she wanted to do it too!</p> <p>"Well, maybe we can get away with it after all," she thought. In her present state of mind, she knew he couldn't tell that he was feeling her tits. Yes, they were big and they felt so soft on his hand. She had her hands on those big melons, squeezing her nipples and teasing them between his fingers. Her hands were also working. One of her hands dipped and found herself rubbing the little nub of flesh with her index finger. That sent electric jolts of pleasure straight to her cunt. She was almost lost in orgasm again. Then, when the guy had stopped pumping his hips and she had felt him come - it was when he'd pushed his dick inside her cunt so far that she'd almost lost her mind.</p> <p>She looked back at him and smiled. "It would be just as nice, wouldn't it?" she thought. With that she put one hand to her chest and pulled open her tits – big, firm, bouncy tits that she had lost so much. She rubbed them and tweaked them. "Oh, they're magnificent!" she murmured appreciatively.</p> <p>He was really going to get off now.</p> <p>"Fuck her!" he said. "Fuck her – she's so hot!"</p> <p>He was standing in between her and the desk. "I'm going to fuck her." and with that he slid his rigid cock down, between her breasts and into the valley of her cleavage. "Yelp, yelp," he managed to say.</p> <p>And his words echoed in her mind. And then he was in her. "That's the one!" she thought. There was no going back now. If he hadn't got her by the shoulders and taken possession of her mouth, she probably would have been on her back again. But this was the real thing. There was no going back.</p> <p>Nils closed his eyes and revelled in the feelings of being inside her – and then he had the sudden impulse of moving round to her face. It was a new sensation, for him to do so! But, he was holding still and feeling so much electricity that he didn't care. He wanted to be inside her all the way! So, he moved round slowly, feeling like he'd hit a brick wall with his thick pole.</p> <p>Nils kept her eyes closed with her lips parted and her mouth wide. He kept moving slowly, feeling his balls and groin on her face, making her mouth wet and inviting, feeling his dick head brush her lips. Then he was pushing in. His cock entered her mouth. She felt full, full at the same time. But the feeling was different here. He was inside her, not in her throat. And at the same time, his prick was moving inside her mouth. And inwards, he thought, moving it inside her mouth, moving it inside there, opening it with his stiff prick, moving it in and out. "Oh yes, Nils!" she murmured. His cock was moving in her mouth. And she was letting it.</p> <p>And now she had it in there. She was swallowing her husband's cock and she wanted it to go further in her mouth. To be that much in love and that much in heat and passion for him. She wanted to feel him come inside her, and for real deep, to feel the hot, real and she wanted him ejaculate, because she just the feeling him go deep on her tongue on her mouth and she felt his—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
