With a spouse in the room or the one sleeping at the other end of the bed, for example, there shouldn't be a reason to feel uncomfortable but to feel free. There's no reason to feel too uncomfortable but for the purpose of making love to her or joining her in enjoying her and participating in the relationship.</p> <p>But when the bedroom door is open on a Sunday morning and the bed is completely clean, the action starts.</p> <p>The bed springs and the soft bedding and the blankets and the sheets and the soft music.</p> <p>The sound of a woman moving under him.</p> <p>The sound of a woman lying next to him with her lover thrusting in and out of her.</p> <p>The sound of a woman in the shower, too.</p> <p>The sight of a man in bed with a woman and woman in bed with him.</p> <p>The sight of a woman naked in the pool and a man in bed with her.</p> <p>The sound of a woman masturbating.</p> <p>The sound of a woman orgasm.</p> <p>The image of a man's penis inside of a woman as it enters her or as it is pulled out of her or as it leaves a male partner.</p> <p>The sound of a woman crying.</p> <p>The sound of a woman sobbing.</p> <p>The sound of a woman trying to masturbate.</p> <p>The sound of a woman crying on a man or on a woman and another man or woman that is trying to masturbate.</p> <p>The sound of a woman's orgasms.</p> <p>The sound of a woman's orgasms.</p> <p>The sound of a woman climaxing for a man but to a woman or to a woman with a man.</p> <p>The sound of a woman's orgasm.</p> <p>When the sex is passionate enough, however, the sounds of the two of them together are just too strong to resist.</p> <p>The two of the lovers are doing exactly that.</p> <p>The sounds of two cuddling, the sounds of moans, breathing and groaning while fucking is so good.</p> <p>The sounds of two people making love have a different meaning to them.</p> <p>The sounds of fingers slapping.</p> <p>The sounds of a woman getting her nails done while being fucked by a man.</p> <p>The sounds of men being eaten, the sounds of a woman being fucked by a man and a woman being made love to.</p> <p>The sounds of a woman cumming on a man's cock.</p> <p>The sound of a woman's cries.</p> <p>The sound of a woman's screams.</p> <p>The sounds of love making.</p> <p>The sounds of orgasmic release.</p> <p>The sounds of two people making love are so good.</p> <p>The sounds of the two people fucking have a different meaning to it.</p> <p>The sounds of a woman climaxing on a man.</p> <p>The sounds of a man ejaculating inside of a woman or a woman climaxing on a woman.</p> <p>The sounds of a woman cumming on a man.</p> <p>There are such sounds of pleasure when two couples make love.
