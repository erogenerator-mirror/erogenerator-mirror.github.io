He was a man who had a great</strong> mind.</p> <p>Although he had a great body and had plenty of stamina for a good workout, as the old cliché was true on one level it was just a bonus. He wasn't particularly handsome or masculine. Maybe he was a little nerd or was it because he wasn't the only person on the planet, who was also a male, who was the only creature on the planet that wasn't attractive, was a girl in high school, was a person, who wasn't in that kind of world, and just happened to have a huge penis. A bit of the same was true if you didn't count his size. Of course, that big, throbbing erection of his was only partially concealed by his jeans, but still. He had a great ass.</p> <p>Now it was time to find out which kind of world were all the guys in school were willing to come on to him. Rowland and the other girls in her high school were the only people who weren't a little curious about him. This was the first thing the cheerleader did for him. She put on her favorite music and started singing, "Come, Come, Come, Come," by Taylor Lively. Rowland and the other girls in her high school were the one cheerleader who wasn't wearing a button down school t-shirt. Her body was so firm the buttons at her neck were like a pinhole. She wore the most expensive perfume. Every time she breathed it was like heaven. If the world looked down from that great view she was only wearing one button down shirt. The cheerleaders were all that was visible. It was only luck that the cheerleading squad had a big ass to match their breasts.</p> <p>"Why don't you make a decision," she said. "Just go ahead and make the choice. And when it's your decision, you can take it!"</p> <p>After a couple seconds a young man of about eighteen appeared in front of Rowland in her class hall and said: "Okay, I'll go,"</p> <p>Rowland was surprised by his own courage. The man was so young and so handsome. He was standing right in front of her, not at an easy stop. Now he was going to have a decision.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "It's a biggie. Take the next step."</p> <p>"Okay," he said. "It means that I can take a big risk."</p> <p>"You are a risk. And I think that's really worth taking," she said. "Take your shirt off and follow my example."</p> <p>Rowland did as she asked. He unbuttoned his shirt, removed it, and hung it on the wall. Now, she was the one taking the lead.</p> <p>"What would you like to do?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know exactly what to do," he said. "I probably shouldn't take the plunge this way," he said. "I can't stop myself."</p> <p>"What are you afraid of?" she asked.</p> <p>"What do you think about? I guess I wouldn't worry about it," he replied. "I'm not worried. I'm afraid of what it would do to my body if I were to strip down right now so that I can go with the flow and make a decision."</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "But you're right. I think it would be much safer if you stopped. I have already made up my mind."</p> <p>This young man was nervous again. It was clear he wasn't an unknown threat. He didn't want to do exactly what she wanted, but the risk was so much higher than the likelihood of that. This could end up in his best possible scenario. He wanted desperately to do everything she wanted, but, if he couldn't wait, he would stop.</p> <p>"You still seem nervous today," she asked.</p> <p>"No, I'm really not," he said. "I'm afraid you'll decide to take your own time, or something else." There was something very personal and almost intimate about his words. Rowland wasn't particularly comfortable with the word choice so she couldn't tell what his decision was.</p> <p>"Do you do all that stuff," she asked. "Do you like watching me? Have you ever seen me naked?"</p> <p>"No, of course not," he said.</p> <p>"Well, maybe I might like to see you naked?" she said. "Do you usually like to watch a man naked before?"</p> <p>"No," he said nervously.</p> <p>"Have a seat," she said. "I'll be right back in front of you in a seconse." This is one of my little more interesting clothes and, where I'm in the most interesting. I'll like them to keep in my very clothes to watch you." She's a pair of you. In your clothes." the clothes, like this one of things. You.
