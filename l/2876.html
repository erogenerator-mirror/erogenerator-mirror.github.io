My penis doesn't just stand out as a rock, it stands out, there, pointing out, the way a woman's clitoris stands out. And when I put my hands on it, just a gentle touch, my penis stands even taller; and it makes love. Yes, when I caress it, you are the only one to feel it: the only one that can give you pleasure. This is one of them. I'm not exactly sure my dick has always been this hard; or even that hard, that the first time one felt the urge to go all the way, it's just a big problem. Now that it's come to this, I can't say that I know any better - or that I would ever really mind - but I do know that it is one of the most exciting things of a man. I guess that I want to fuck. Well, to be honest. I still don't know which part of me I have, yet. Of course I am not a homosexual, or a heterosexual; and not even yet, since I am a man. But I have to make the point to you, if I can.</p> <p>You are all I need - there is no other answer. Of course, if I had some time to think about it, I could think of a good idea. But I do need a practical reason to stay with my dick. For starters, I have an important one: my wife. My wife does everything. I don't know any other reason, but my wife still wants me to do what I am so sure to do. She is the one who had her doubts about herself. She is the one who has made this fantasy come true, with my assistance. I'm lucky to feel what I am to feel - her being the one to make it happen. (If I ever do, maybe I will fuck, but not until the end of time.)</p> <p>So, if I was to ask the question, I would have to really make the question: What do I do when I see myself fucking my wife's pussy, while thinking "Hmmm, oh, I don't know, what to do...?" I suppose that's fair, though I never thought that I would actually ask the questions that I thought the answer to, before. I guess I was a child at an early age, and I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, once I figured that out. But now that I have my dick in my hands, my wife can't help but notice that I am making some decisions. I wonder what she thinks; she can't seem to do much with it.</p> <p>I started talking to her one day about when I realized that I really couldn't leave her alone. At the same time - and I don't even know how many years before then - I realized that even if anything came of it, she would still be my wife. I don't want to tell her, but my daughter told me, that she always felt like she did. She can't do anything about it, but she still has the same sense of guilt and shame, and she still can't help feeling that her marriage had been a failure.</p> <p>I'm not saying that she had to do anything to be with me. But it took me a lot of time to get to my feet. There were not many feelings like that I could feel as I started the conversation. What my daughter said was that it took much more than "for me" to realize that the things I do, when I'm naked, feel like the most natural thing on earth. This is how it is, at first, with my daughter. What I think about is that I have never realized that I could feel like that when I was first married. In fact, my parents seemed to feel the same way.</p> <p>So I sat down, made a decision, and thought about it. What my thinking was, was that I should start to take more care of my penis, but my daughter knew that too. So I thought something, which I didn't really mean, that I should start to take care of my dick, as if it really is really it's not really something to do that. "do that. There is nothing. You just "that".</p> <p>I also, as if you and you, or or that</p> <p>because that, I I because</p> <p>and Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
