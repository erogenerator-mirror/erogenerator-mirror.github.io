Her ideas only varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good deal; and</strong> then she realized we made this decision without any input.</p> <p>I still hadn't made up mind whether I wanted to make love to Emma. She looked at me, still thinking and wondered what the matter of it. I felt so good, I could have fucked a tree trunk without missing a beat. I was almost ready to come already. The feeling would be bliss for all of us. And to fuck the other side to a better state would be hell!</p> <p>"I want to taste you," I said, my cock in Emma's mouth yet only an inch or two away from her face.</p> <p>"Ohh..." she said.</p> <p>I slowly backed away until my cock popped out of her pussy. We kissed again after she put the condom on. We kissed for a few moments, my hands tracing over Emma's curves. It's nice to have a little control in these circumstances.</p> <p>"How do you want me?" I asked.</p> <p>"On all fours."</p> <p>"In your pussy," I said to no one in particular.</p> <p>"In your ass."</p> <p>"That would be nice too," I replied.</p> <p>She gave me that half smile again. "Do you ever get it in your ass?"</p> <p>"Not with a strap-on."</p> <p>"Good girl. But what about this..." I ran my finger over Emma's ass crack, the only place I haven't touched her pussy during our lovemaking. "Here, rub some lube over it."</p> <p>She took the gel in her hand and gently began rubbing it around my asshole. I looked at her for a moment while she applied the lubricant herself. Then I did the same to her. We went back to kissing again. Slowly working our way up toward intercourse. I pushed my cock into Emma's pussy, slipping it inside her as part of it. She gasped as my cock entered her. Again, our kisses became more passionate. She moaned with every inch.</p> <p>My hands wandered to her breasts. This was so wonderful.</p> <p>"Please...fuck me..." Emma said. "Fuck me hard."</p> <p>Fuck me deep - I liked that. Right now she's too good to be true. Emma was in total heaven. I felt for the first time something more than a man's penis in her pussy - a very nice dick.</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "That's it...harden up."</p> <p>I pulled my cock out of her pussy, it glistened with her juices. She took it into her mouth and licked the head. The feeling of her mouth on my cock made me gasp, it's a good dick.</p> <p>"Oh Emma, this will be good," I moaned.</p> <p>She sucked the head again, swirling her tongue around the tip. It felt so good. She continued to pleasure me. I moaned as I held back, not wanting to come in her mouth.</p> <p>"I'm coming..." she said, bringing her fingers to her pussy.</p> <p>Soon, I felt the warmth of her wetness envelop my cock with her pussy. It was so warm and soft. I had a great time.</p> <p>"Oh Emma," I said. "You are so beautiful."</p> <p>We kissed again, just long enough to feel the tension of the end.</p> <p>"Now, I want to fuck you."</p> <p>"Fuck me in your ass," she replied.</p> <p>"Your ass, I haven't fucked it so..."</p> <p>"Can't have your cock in my bum, no matter how much you want..." Emma said, giving me her most mischievous grin.</p> <p>I didn't want to fuck her in her beautiful pussy, but that's not my choice. "There's some lubricant already in the bathroom," I offered to Emma.</p> <p>"Of course," she said, giving me a sly wink, then she returned to where I was lying, her ass over the end of the bed.</p> <p>She lubed up my cock as best as she could...and then held the head in her warm asshole.</p> <p>"You're very hard already," she said.</p> <p>"You're such a hot lady," I said to her. I pulled myself out of her pussy and ass to let her know how it would feel.</p> <p>"This is a very special moment, too," she said while continuing to hold my cock while positioning herself for the most anal experience I've had in one day. "But first, I want to eat your pussy, that's right here."</p> <p>To say that I wanted that. But I wanted Emma to be in Emma's Emma in my ass - oh her ass.</p> <p>"But I wanted to be a girlâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
