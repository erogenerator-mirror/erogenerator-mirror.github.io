When the hearse had driven off, when the priest and the choir boy had entered the</strong> coffin, it had been the end of it, the last of the service. As their service was ending, the service was beginning:</p> <p>The service was a simple one, to say the least. It was in front of the coffin. It had been sealed with a heavy steel seal, and the only thing that held the coffin up was those of the priest and the choir boy. The priest was naked with his hands on his hips and his head buried in between the coffin's legs. The choir boy was kneeling on one side of the coffin, while the priest was kneeling on the other.</p> <p>Then the chapel service began. Jean Valjean was not in a wheelchair. She was in a reclining chair in front of her husband who was lying on one, while the choir boy was kneeling and sucking her pussy. The nuns had been there already and their bodies were moving together with much vigor. Then the priests came and stood in front of the coffin, in front of both of them. Jean Valjean was the first to cry out. She had been frightened. She did not know what she was going to do.</p> <p>"Oh, honey," she heard her baby brother cry, "what are you going to do?"</p> <p>"Oh, my beautiful daughter, what are we going to do?" John said cheerfully, "Do you know? You were right there. I'm going to come here and do this."</p> <p>"No! I didn't do it," she cried out, "I didn't enjoy it. I can't, I can't," she sobbed miserably.</p> <p>John smiled. It was the best news he had ever heard. He was going to do that, and he would do what he thought was right. He was going to come here and let this happen. It was the best news he had ever heard. They were going to have a good time, and they would go to heaven together.</p> <p>John was the first to enter Jean Valjean's vagina and put his penis inside her. His penis slid all the way inside of her hot opening, and he was on his way. He started his first thrusting, and it was wonderful. It was wonderful for both of them, and it was wonderful for him. After a while, John's penis made another progress and Jean Valjean's vaginal canal was expanding a little bit, stretching slightly, and John realized at the very end that she was ready and willing for him to enter the heaven together with her.</p> <p>He continued to thrust while he started his rhythm, but slowly at first, almost as if he was doing what was so beautiful. After a while, with his penis going more than halfway in her vaginal canal, a special feeling came over Jean Valjean. John could tell that something special would have happened to her. She pushed against him and began a powerful orgasm.</p> <p>With his penis in her vagina for a moment, he came, with great excitement in feeling her vaginal canal expanding, then closing with his penis as if it were her vagina. He looked up at her as her eyes opened and she smiled that sweet smile.</p> <p>After he got over and they went back to their positions, John pulled out the key, made his way with Jean as she lay on one side and John with the other on top. He sat up and started kissing one of her nipples, and then the other. Then he began rubbing his penis all over her face. He continued to rub his penis over Jean's face and up her nose and then he put his penis between her lips.</p> <p>Jean Valjean opened her mouth and moved her tongue all over his penis. Then she closed her mouth around it, sucked it, and then she moved her head back and forth, slowly at first, but soon she kept on moving her head up and down, slowly at first but rapidly. After a while, she went faster and faster, then she slowly closed her eyes while her tongue continued working over John's penis. She was having an orgasm in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>Then John lifted himself up a little bit to get a better angle and he put his penis between her legs, and his penis inside her vagina. "Do you think it's what I'm aiming at, baby?"</p> <p>"Yes," Jean Valjean said between moans, "but do you think it feels too good, please, please, please, please, please."</p> <p>John slowly moved his penis in and out, and Jean Valjean moaned, "No, I don't like this. This is too good."</p> <p>"It will feel good for us both," John replied, "but it only gets better. It must feel good."</p> <p>"Yes, it feels good for both of you, it does," Jean Valj</p> <p></p> <p>"But not quite," John and it really, but I'll you'll like, it feels good and it's wonderful too—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
