Though Nicholas Rostóv had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving</strong> in the Soviet Union, he had been less enthusiastic about fucking in this country. Indeed, when he had visited Moscow, he had been very disappointed at the Russian man’s lack of enthusiasm to fuck in all his years. And he remembered how much he had wanted to fuck in that country.</p> <p>When this morning had finished with Nicholas Rostóv, he wondered exactly how many times he would be fucked in his life. Although the Russian man had been in a state of affairs in this country, he was not a participant in any organized religious activity. He had been unable to participate in any sort of sport or any kind of music. And he had never been completely sexually satisfied by anything. He was a different kind of a man after all.</p> <p>Nowadays, his sex life had ended. There was one more person who had to be kept fucking.</p> <p>Nicholas Rostóv was a long time a member of the Russian National Party, an all-female branch in the eastern Soviet Republic. And he had a lot of female members. Many of the sex activities he enjoyed with females of a different sexual orientation were among girls who were sexually active. He had been fucked in nearly every way, including in the vagina and the anus, but he never experienced the best of sensation from any of those areas. For him, an intense sexual ecstasy was so much better than the best.</p> <p>His friends were just that. Friends, which were not so numerous, he found very interesting. And he could not tell whether he should take a group relationship for himself. But what choice did he have? He only had one choice. And there was no way that he wanted his sex life to become something which was too complicated for a group.</p> <p>He had already met someone on the Internet.</p> <p>But there was a part of his mind which still wanted to fuck a girl. He had seen how much younger women had been in America. And he was a very good lover for a girl. He could see that some girls' breasts were quite small, given the size of their chests, but that he could just suck and enjoy them all night long. And he couldn't say that he enjoyed sex with them too much as he had always told himself.</p> <p>And he knew that the most appealing of young girls was actually his best friend, Anna, who looked much younger than him at the very beginning. They were both very tall. And both of them had long smooth hair. But even with their short hair, they had the looks of a model or actress. It was very attractive.</p> <p>After all, he could not be serious about sex with Anna. He could pretend to take it for granted (and of course never even think of sex with Anna) if he didn't want to go through with it. They were much more attractive than that other girl in his class, but that was impossible. What he had done for Anna was impossible. He could just pretend it was a girl who liked to eat pussy. Who liked to eat pussy. If it didn't look like a lot of girls did, then why do he waste his time on a schoolgirl?</p> <p>He had already made up his mind to fuck Anna too. He couldn't think of that in any way. He knew that he didn't really want to do it because he could never convince Anna to make it official.</p> <p>But what to do when he met Anna? He could make the decision of whether to take the initiative in such a fashion with her at the party, then, once he saw her, he could take the initiative herself at the party.</p> <p>To go with his plans, he would have to take Anna to meet that person who had introduced himself on the Internet. He could arrange it in advance. He would meet her in the same town, from where she had worked previously.</p> <p>And then he could invite her to come back to England.</p> <p>It couldn't have been a good day.</p> <p>In fact, Anna had already booked herself back to England. What she hadn't done was to come back to England as if she was meeting someone else. Anna was already out with Anna, and although Nicholas didn't know her, she had already taken a fancy to her. It was just a matter of time.</p> <p>She was now gone.</p> <p>Nicholas had thought about asking her about her motives for trying to fuck him, but it seemed like more than that. It occurred to him that it might also have been a good point in his life. If she were to do it, he could simply be very happy for her. Perhaps it would even be a good idea if she were to do it alone, for she had been very much a good sport lover to him, in all of the years she has known him. Besides all of her.</p> <p>Nicholas would love to make it to be her his first, as</p> <p></p> <p>Nicholas would take the pleasure for herself.
