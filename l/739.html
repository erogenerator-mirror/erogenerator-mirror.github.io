She had not, indeed, been thinking much about the beauty of the country,</strong> how he loved it and, since he had been on his way back from college, had admired it as well.</p> <p>They were going to be friends, they would be best friends, they would go to university together and, as long as she had her mouth on his cock, she would keep her word.</p> <p>His cock was already hard, though the head was already on the tip of the foreskin, so it was still a big tease to be going down on Mrs Palmer again; and it was the last chance to take advantage of one of his new fantasies, to fuck his wife in her bed again.</p> <p>Evelyn smiled, remembering how often he had wanted to fuck her again and she loved fucking him, how hard he had loved fucking her, how well she had loved fucking him as well, especially after hearing her voice in a hotel bed, the way her mouth had made love to his hard cock in one day and it had made him so hard and made her cum so many times, and most importantly she'd loved fucking him again.</p> <p>But she was married, but she still loved him, loved fucking his cock, loved giving him head, loved seeing him in a sexy dress, love that he was so sexy and could make her feel so good, loved feeling his hard cock in her mouth.</p> <p>And she wanted another round from her favourite fantasy, the one where they were fucking their brains out.</p> <p>After they'd already gone several years she was sure he was going to fuck her in the way that her first cock had been fucking a good-looking woman in the first bedroom and it turned her on to just imagine it. After they'd been fucking her for a few months all over again she was keen to try anything again, she was desperate to fuck so many others but she couldn't even do it anymore.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>"Fuck me! Fuck me hard," Mrs Palmer said enthusiastically as she lay on her back in the dark, looking as if she was watching a film without being able to really see it. She looked gorgeous and she loved it that way, that seductive seductive look and her head was down, looking almost as if she was looking at an art in the dark.</p> <p>She smiled when she saw him take hold of himself and then slowly, almost seductively, he bent over her, pushing his hard cock against her moist, eager pussy. With his eyes closed to enjoy the moment, his hands on her inner thighs she looked down at his hard cock and smiled.</p> <p>"That's right," she said, with a slight slur of her mouth, "you're fucking Mrs Palmer in the dark," she said. "And she's so wet, so ready for you. Do it!"</p> <p>Mr Palmer moaned and then he did. He bent forward, grabbed his cock again, pushing it against his wife's pussy, pushed himself hard upwards against and then downwards against it before he sank all the way in.</p> <p>"Oh Godddd," sighed Mrs Palmer as he fucked her. "That feels so good," he told her, "so fucking fucking GOOD!"</p> <p>A minute later, having already cum, and feeling his weight pressing into her, she looked over at his face as he was fucking her, smiled at him and said, "I can't believe I'm doing this but I want you to fuck me hard, Mr Palmer! I want to feel every inch of that hard cock as you're fucking me."</p> <p>She turned around and sat on the bed, her head resting on the pillows and he was lying on top of her on his side, his cock wedged against the side of her hip. He leaned over her and she felt his cock press against her breast, against her nipple, which was already hard and pushing against the fabric of her skirt.</p> <p>"You know you like being able to fuck my tits," she said softly. "Especially when you're fucking my mouth because my tongue feels so good," she said. "And my pussy?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Yes, very much," he said and he moved his hand down to her leg, slid it up and down his wife's leg as he fucked her, before moving his hand up to her breast and sliding his other hand along the inside of her leg, again up and down her thigh.</p> <p>"So do you feel good?" she asked him, her head leaning back, her eyes closed, her mouth full and open, her breathing quick and shallow.</p> <p>"I feel so good," he said and. "so good, Mrs Palmer, so beautiful, so good," he said. "I hope you like your pussy feels so good." . . his voice, so good."</p> <p>just repeating his words and so well enough to say. It's so lovely to her breath. Thats me. and, I like.
