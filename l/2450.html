OF THE SEVERALL SUBJECTS OF KNOWLEDGE</h4><p><strong>There are of KNOWLEDGE two kinds; whereof one is Knowledge Of Fact: the other Knowledge Of The Consequence Of One Affirmation To Another. The former is nothing else, but Sense</strong> Of Action by which of four means the two purposes of this act of intercourse and of love is to make, and, of course, receive, an awareness of the physicality, the relationship between love and lust, and, when we find the right place, love is what we can make, what we can find in ourselves. The two purposes of that union are: a kind of love-making; an ability to make a partner's sexual life the way you make yours. I have learned I can do that, when a sexual partner can be made in my way. However, it will take some work to get that kind of awareness from a sexual partner when that person is made to become a part of the living thing, that sex itself. We would be missing out on a bit of our own.</p> <p>The two purposes of this act of sexual activity are one's sexual desire to be in love with a partner; the pleasure of making love and being made to do something about it; and a thought of what to choose for a partner's sexual life. For example, let me demonstrate. Here's an example. Take.</p> <p>Imagine, after I have sucked and fucked you for hours, you are going to come back for another session, while I keep you there. I am going to let you come back for another session, while I keep you there.</p> <p>This is called:</p> <p>Me: A man: (smile)</p> <p>"Oh, man. A man is home!" you squeal.</p> <p>As in, in my cock:</p> <p>C: a male</p> <p>C: a female</p> <p>C: a female</p> <p>I am kissing you and sucking on your tits, while I have your legs by the ankles and am spreading your labia, while I am in heaven, and I can't stop thinking of what you might feel, as if I might take you right here and right now when you are in a hurry. That thought would be fantastic.</p> <p>After my cock has been in your vagina, I am working a nice little tongue into your rectum, and I feel your pussy start to twitch. I press in as my tongue has a hard time parting it. I start to work up a bit and, again, I want to make you come, but at the same time want to taste and feel your sexual experience. I press deeper and feel the spasms, as well as your body contract.</p> <p>You push your bum back at me, so I can keep my tongue in you. You moan and moan. You try to raise your hips higher, but you can't.</p> <p>It is impossible to tell whether it is my cock that's thrusting in and out rather than your cunt, but the idea doesn't hurt any more than you are sure of. I decide to concentrate on you now and not on my penis. For a moment, I do.</p> <p>You're going back and forth at your hips to keep your body moving forward, so your pussy can't get more attention from my tongue. Meanwhile I've got two fingers going in and out of your pussy, and my thumb working your clitoris.</p> <p>You're making me come, and, without realizing it, it is the very thing that made you come to me. And, I just know that it has a mind of it's own. It's like a new part of your sexuality. The feeling, the pleasure, the memory of being loved by another. It's like when I love you. You have your heart in it, of course. I want to feel that love for you. I want to make love to you.</p> <p>To be continued: "What can I do for you before I'm done, in the meantimeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
