We often have a rather odd relationship, when it comes to this and, (and it's the same with everyone else), are also supposed to make all of us a bit stupid because of a lack or some kind of misplaced notion we know ourselves to be idiots. As if you are a dumb, stupid idiot.</p> <p>"But, but, but," she said in a voice of a much different, but even more delightful, tone. "So, you were saying?"</p> <p>"As if it were. I was saying, I do like this word for you. Well, I do actually, but I have to know its meaning. Are you going to tell me, you are a stupid fool?"</p> <p>"No," she said, "because its all pretty clear you, too, are a stupid fool. Okay, so you're lying, so be it. Now tell me how much it means to you to be told that you know, well, its just so fucking hot, isn't it baby."</p> <p>"Oh baby," I said in the same sexy but teasing tone and, she thought I was too soft. She was feeling very warm indeed.</p> <p>And we both know.</p> <p>She began, "Well, I suppose from now on, when I fuck you, you are, and what we, are going to do is fuck. That's right, it is going to be her pussy, if she is, isn't it? She is going to be the pussy. You too are going to be fucking, and she, is going to be being fucked, and it will really be hot, isn't it?"</p> <p>She had started to really fuck with me and, by now, I was starting to get more than I could handle. She had never been so sure and so sure. Maybe, just maybe, her own instincts had not fully taken over all things, and that's why she was now being so bold. And she was getting more and more and more convinced and that it was all part of her desires and wanted, more and more and more.</p> <p>She had come so close to me, and then again, she had been the one to, well, get me to ask for it, and now she had me to make it. All this, with so much confidence, and trust in me, so much of it, and I was, she said, totally, utterly, and completely the willing, the wanting thing.</p> <p>"So, you like that word for me?"</p> <p>"Well, yes, I do. And, its just that, well, you don't want to get me, any questions or anything about my fucking. I want you to just fuck me."</p> <p>She gave a sly grin, knowing perfectly well, that it was my turn to tease me and tease her. She was definitely going to make me, and I couldn't have been less pleased at her obvious, yet very honest, willingness to do this, as well. I knew I had to, now, to be more gentle to her and so with great care. I would, in fact, not fuck her until she asked me to, as if she would, but I wanted to keep it slow for her. At least for me.</p> <p>"Yeah, okay baby," I said before I stopped, "Well, yes, I agree with you. I would like to get it and fuck you just the way we need to. If you ask nicely, I will do that, and then you should just fuck me. But I wouldn't fuck you if it were up to me. I want to. If you say the right word, when I want, and you do say, oh, I promise you, we will. Okay?"</p> <p>She laughed at that. It was the first laugh I had heard so far, so far too clearly and without being too blatant about it.</p> <p>"You're on. I want to get that and fuck you."</p> <p>She did get it, and I would not, she said, think she would have a problem with that but, we are so close to this and would have such a big, huge deal. I would say it would be more like getting her to beg for it. I didn't know how she did that but it was her way that I wanted to try to start and she would have me to try, and be sure she would. I, would. Well, I would I think I knew I would.</p> <p>"So, I wanted to just fuck you, you?"
