Gillenormand’s two daughters. They had come into the world ten years apart. In their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other,</strong> as all were well spoken adults. They were not particularly good friends. They were very young, when it was their age they were both only in their late twenties. In fact, they only graduated seven months apart. I looked forward to a chance to spend the first few months of the summer holiday with them in the country where I grew up.</p> <p>For those of you reading this, perhaps you already know what happened.
