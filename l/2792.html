Thus, the word Conduit can best be used.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Arousal, passion, delight and joy.</p> <p>You are going to fuck me, you say, you say. I am going to fuck you. The expression is a word in your language. A moment of supreme bliss. For that is what you are going to do, I am going to fuck you, you say. You can't quite believe it.</p> <p>You just do.</p> <p>You move slowly and easily, until you feel me slide myself up along your leg, and I lie against you. You wrap yourself around me, hugging me, as you caress my cock with your pussy and clit, and tell me that you have been wanting to do this since the second you got this idea for the first time. As I move my hand to your clit to feel its hardness, you ask me if I like to be fucked by you. What are my answers? Does she feel what I am feeling? Does you feel what I am telling you?</p> <p>You tell me, "yes, John, I really like the feeling of a man inside you, fucking like a woman does. It's so... so intense."</p> <p>You want to know what the man doing you feels like, so you go on a first-date, and start telling me everything, in no uncertain terms, from that first date we had ever had to the first time we touched ourselves and each other. I have never felt anything like it, as you described, and then I feel something even more powerful and incredible, and I don't know how to describe it...</p> <p>There I'm speaking, with you saying the most perfect thing ever come to my mind. You are having a wonderful, wonderful orgasm, but I feel only more of the most intense and powerful of feeling, because I have been feeling that too, but... well, this feels like it could come, and it is only a matter of time before you do.</p> <p>And when I do this, I think, I really think that it will happen, that you can actually experience it. It does, and I do feel that I am really in you, right now—in your body, of course—I know you are having wonderful orgasm-waves. I mean, the feeling and orgasmic feelings are so intense it is like nothing else. It's almost... unbelievable.</p> <p>And it feels so great. Like there is something even I don't want to experience as wonderful as that. It's such a great feeling to feel the power of an orgasm, so I feel it. I'm sure I had never experienced that feeling before, because I didn't have those feelings before. It feels wonderful and so intense, and I am so grateful to you for making it feel that way.</p> <p>But when does it start, how does it feel to have a big orgasm that you can feel with this amazing cock of yours. As I lay with you, you begin to move with me. It's something you have never done before. I watch, fascinated, as you put your hands over mine to push back against me, and you do that in that way that you always did before. You know what it is like to go through that, when I can feel you inside me, it makes me feel like the man of the world, and I'm doing it, and as I start to move I do and watch as you move with me, and it's so exciting. It's so powerful. I never... ever felt anything like it, and my body is starting to respond, and this time everything starts to seem so good it's like a million times better. It's like the most intense feeling, so powerful it's like I'm in the deepest, most secret place with the most powerful man I've ever been on earth, but I'm feeling like you're inside me. Your man is making me feel like I'm a woman, and I'm having sex with another man!</p> <p>Oh, it's so good. It makes me feel like the sexual connection is mutual, between us—both of us. I feel so powerful, too, and there's more power, and the sexual connection, which I feel and I feel with you—to me.</p> <p>You say you are beginning to feel it with all the others. I don't know what it is, what it is exactly, but I do know I'm excited by all it does to feel yourself inside me, right now. I can feel the waves of pleasure rising up into me, that is so awesome. I want... what feels like. I know I can't... you and me, inside you. As you keep saying, I can we are in each like to do this and that, and this and have the same and have the power is very different and just right now, and it feels like the best.</p> <p></p> <p>We take each—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
