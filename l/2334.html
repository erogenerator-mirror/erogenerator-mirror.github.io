G. Wells </h3><h4>In the Golden Age</h4><p><strong>“In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absence</strong> of time in time was like nothing I had ever felt before. We were like a big, big close bond between us, because we were the only two things there. We were the only two things we were aware of. For whatever reason he got a funny, possessive look in his eyes, and he kissed me. It was sweet and passionate, but it lasted only a moment because my body was still tingling. He pushed me back into the closet, and we made love. It was a glorious coupling of physical and spiritual fulfillment.</p> <p>He started by kissing me everywhere. He kissed me in stages, on my forehead, on my lips, my throat, my chest and finally on my breasts. He kissed my nipples and licked them, sucked on them and nibbled them. I loved every second of it. He rolled over me to take me in his arms and we kissed. Slowly he kissed down my body and as he got down to my pussy, I couldn't believe how horny I was. I could barely control myself, I started kissing his neck and he whispered, “Let’s try another position.” He put his hands through the small opening. I saw his huge, hard, uncircumcised dick standing out, like a giant tree in front of me, waiting to be cut. The thing was gorgeous. It was at least 8 inches long and the thickness was amazing. It was like the end of a stick, thick and veiny. I watched and listened as it twitched and pulsated in anticipation.</p> <p>Without saying a word, he got between my legs, spreading them, spreading his legs, and thrusting it in. I looked at him like a cat waiting to pounce, and it took no time at all for him to push the entirety of his massive cock inside of me. I groaned as we both groaned in pleasure. I knew what was happening now. I felt as though it was about to happen. I wanted to feel him as deep inside as he could go. He moved back and forth, slowly, gently, very gently, and it was just as it should be. It was like being out in the cool morning for months. It made us both crazy.</p> <p>It was time to start a new round to our lovemaking. There was no point in being coy about it anymore. Not only were we going to do everything that we felt so good doing with each other, we both also had the same objective in mind.</p> <p>He moved out of the way, and positioned himself directly behind me. I was so ready for this, it didn't take long before he was in front of me, and his head was hovering just in front of my lips. I put my hands on his thick, powerful biceps and gave him a big kiss, tasting his wonderful, hard skin and feeling his big penis inside of me. He continued his slow, intense pace for several strokes, then, I felt the familiar sensation of his penis pushing at my vaginal walls and making a squishy and wet, wet, squishy sound. He had no resistance left. I felt that if we both wanted this, then we did. If we both needed this, we needed to feel good.</p> <p>The intensity grew at an inexorable level. He was pumping me just like I had seen my boyfriend do in porn videos, all the way in and out. He was a big, strong and athletic man with a very long cock that could make even his muscles work overtime. I kept trying to lift my hips to take him as deep as I could. I finally had to take his hands off of my hips. He held both my hands in his and used his thumbs to stroke my nipples. He pinched my nipples and pulled and twisted them. The pain was excruciating, but at the same time it was just delicious for me. My pussy was throbbing and getting wetter by the minute. I wanted him to stop. It was just torture. I didn't want this to stop. I wanted us both to think of it as the greatest thing ever. It felt so good, so right, so right. We both wanted us to feel this as just another part of our lovemaking, the pleasure we were giving and receiving.</p> <p>We lay together in that way for a long while. Time had no meaning, so I don't know how long it was. I must have drifted off to a place of pleasure that I didn't even realize existed. As soon as I thought I was back in my own place, I went back to that place where I thought of it as all the joys were. The pleasures were all I had ever felt that night. What was I, just another man, just another cock sucker? I couldn't seem, I could never get enough pleasure from him. My vagina, for one taste and feel something was like he didn't even. I wanted more of him, and more of something of him; the most things to be all—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
