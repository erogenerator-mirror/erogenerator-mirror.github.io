These were odors known as pungent cigarettes (partly due to their ability to retain flame, so they cannot be smoked by smokers).</p> <p>The more inhaled these odors, the more aroused and aroused it aroused Mezur. He had never before experienced such a strong and stimulating reaction. The more he was aroused by this, the more he could not control himself. He pulled his fingers free, he was close. He pushed his hand toward her cunt, and it seemed like the first stroke, then he heard her emit a cry.</p> <p>This was the very end, of the act of lovemaking between them. She was not wet, as he had not hoped for. The smell of fear and anxiety wafted into his senses, and there were some slight hints which indicated there was a very dangerous and unpredictable nature in her sexual response. For now though she seemed to be enjoying it.</p> <p>He moved his cock between her cunt lips. He began to pump. It seemed to take forever. She was obviously extremely excited and very wet. He wanted her to come again. He wanted to make her come, but did not know how to do that. He wanted to come into her cunt, and watch her juices squirt out of her, but did not know how, perhaps he was going to find out whether she would actually do that! He could not stop there though. He pulled away, and she squealed in her joy. This was the last straw.</p> <p>He pulled her back onto him. She could not take more. His cock entered her cunt easily. He felt her cunt muscles and her inner walls tighten around him as his shaft slid into her pussy, then her cunt muscles started to tighten. He could not help himself. Her whole body seemed to shudder. This did not seem possible. Here, the walls of her pussy seemed to have a life of their own. He could feel the veins, the flesh of her pussy walls; the wetness of her pussy lips; and even the small spasms of skin, tissue, and hair; every molecule of her being seemed to move inside of her. All the things that had been done here were very, very pleasant, the most erotic and loving that he would ever experience. But now he knew that it was not merely pleasure. But also a very, very bad and disturbing consequence of this. Yes, the pungent aroma of her cunt had a new meaning! It made his heart skip a beat! Could he not, that was unthinkable. Did he not deserve for her all to have this power now?</p> <p>She was screaming for him now! The pain, the pain of her clamped, closed eyes and, although she had been in pain, she was now screaming for him! She was crying with delight all over once again! "Fuck me with you cock! Fuck me! Fuck me hard! Put that cock in me! Hurry! Hurry! Ah, ah, ah!" she wailed, as she became, one of her pleasures, more than a simple lover, but a most sensual lover of love. He was being given this pleasure by the most desirable woman he had ever known. The thought that he was able to take such pleasure from, had taken his mind away from the idea of her being such a good lover.</p> <p>He wanted to be on top her, for their lovemaking to be more than sex. He wanted her on her back, his cock deep into her; her hand guided him. He could not think of anything more than his own pleasure, that was far too great; she had made him love to her.</p> <p>"Shoot your load into me you bastard! I want to feel you give me that big piece of meat of yours!" She whispered, with an urgency in her voice. "I want to see your cock going into me!" And with that she rolled over and took his cock to her cunt as she had once again.</p> <p>He did not need any more thought. He did not need to be told. He let himself get carried away, and slid his cock into her. She welcomed and accepted it. He had felt the muscles contract inside his cock, and his belly tighten. He fucked her while his mind was in turmoil. He thought that what ever she thought was happening to him, he would never be able to tell it was her! It was a moment that he could not have anticipated. Here he was, thrusting his prick inside of her, making her body jerk, as he had done to her. And she herself, when she had been there, had let herself enjoy and rejoice. She was in her orgasmic bliss, as her body had been, of late, and the moment of penetration into which had caused her to be like a part to act with its own passion. And she was part with her partner.
