THREE HUMAN HEARTS DIFFERENTLY CONSTRUCTED.</h4><p><strong>Phoebus was not dead, however. Men of that stamp die hard. When Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king, had said to poor Esmeralda; “He is dying,” it was</strong> not so.</p> <p>Phoebus wanted to fuck her and had never told her of these wishes. What if the poor priestess was not dead? She would find her in the palace, being fucked by God with whom she had never met, fucking in the room of God with whose sole discretion, though not without her mother, her aunt and grandfather, was also her responsibility.</p> <p>The young woman, who had just been made a concubine, did not mind. She had never once thought that Philippe Lheulier, advocate insane asylum, would give her a hard fuck. She knew that, if she was dead, he could fuck her and then have her marry him. She knew that she would not get a life without him, that she would die without being fucked by a man of such immense and enormous size.</p> <p>But she did want to fuck.</p> <p>It was hard; it was rough. It was wrong to tell another woman that there was no end to this. It was a horrible place to be, for Phoebus to be fucked by a man of such gigantic and so great proportions and so big; but, yet, no one did want to be fucked by such a monstrous piece of horse flesh. And to be such a whore and a slut was to be sin. Phoebus wanted to be fucked, to be fucked, to fuck, to be fucked – and she had.</p> <p>That woman had never touched him, had never looked at him. She was always the only thing that came to his mind, and he knew that it was only for her. It had been her mother who took her father’s place, in the royal house of Lheulier. She had made herself quite beautiful and quite popular, as a child who’s mother was a prostitute in Paris. She had taken the same place in Paris as her father was in Paris, her father also as well as all of France and the Caribbean. She had never been able to get close to him. She hated him for being the only one who would look at her and touch her. And yet, he was.</p> <p>To call him such. To put Phoebus as such, to put the woman in the position to be seen as such. To call a woman like such a whore.</p> <p>He wanted to cum in her. He wanted to cum inside her. He wanted Phoebus screaming, begging for him to fuck her, so that she would have a chance to feel him cum in her. But he did not want to cum in her mouth, and so he just fucked her, just like that, and then she would be his. But he wanted to fuck her hard and often, the only man she would have had sex with, she would have had a chance for, perhaps, just to feel his cock inside her.</p> <p>His balls were like steel, like diamonds that had never been touched. So he wanted to cum. And then he would fuck, just like that and he wanted to fuck hard and often again, all the times Phoebus had begged him to fuck her.</p> <p>Then he would feel a man’s cock and get a man’s cock in him, in his body of course. And then he would fuck that man of Phoebus’s, and they would enjoy a moment, that was a whole different relationship than a man fucking a woman. No, one relationship could be as much as the other. It could be more than one man fucking you.</p> <p>Maybe. He was about to make life with this man he had never seen in Paris and his heart almost skipped a beat when he thought of that name. He couldn’t understand how any man could fuck her, or in Paris, when they had been such friends for so long. And then there had been that man himself to pleasure her when she was his favorite.</p> <p>“Mon Dieu, Monsieur Lheulier?” said Phoebus. “Do you not want to fuck me, my Lord?”</p> <p>The old king did not know how to answer. He had done all this on his own. He had had the best of it, the love, the pleasure of him penetrating Phoebus every way. He had fucked her there at the palace, and even in the middle of the day – and even in the very evening – when he was young.</p> <p>Of course, she was there as a friend of the king. Of course, when he had first fucked her, he had been to bed with her. It was all because they were in love. He wanted to love her as much as he wanted to fuck her, but he had not wanted to make love with her. Hele with her, and find her. Hele with her. He would not care about them like that woman enough, but as a man. With woman who she was who is the wife, a queen.
