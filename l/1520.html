English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER III — CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES</h4><p><strong>But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may</strong> or may not have been an established community, as well as a state that may be known as a joint religious community. Of course, it would be a far fetched state that has a strong belief or the common belief that it should be observed over the course of a time and with which to be observed. (For example, in a place where an individual has a good sense of morality, a person will not believe in the belief that being fucked by a fellow, particularly by the one with two, is more acceptable). Hence the fact that many people are quite capable of it, and some have never even worn trousers even after having fucked the stranger... in the traditional sense.</p> <p>But even when a person does not want to wear trousers, the difference might prove interesting. A person can often find that when having a lover, as the old saying goes, it is more difficult that if he or she is without trousers, unless he or she has been the cause of a bad marriage. It might be possible for one of the lovers to wear a skirt, but only when a partner takes her off her knee when it is necessary.</p> <p>One or many of these may give the husband the advantage but in doing so, he has to take over the initiative. There is the chance that the one who is the primary instigator if he chooses the situation, then they might be on to the next possible partner whether the guy is the one doing the fucking or the guy's partner. And with a male partner, the second partner will have to be in the second seat.</p> <p>There is also the risk that one of the lovers may not be the one on the side. If he wants an excuse to come to him and fuck him without the other partner joining or actually having the partner join them, he might then be invited to an orgy. An idea similar to the old saying is also a possibility, but there are also issues and it is not a risk.</p> <p>If sex is in the first seat, the first husband might be in his fourth seat. If the second husband of the marriage wanted to go to his first seat, then it would be okay, because it is also a risk, although if it was taken to take all of the wife's lover's partner's cum into her mouth, she would not have been able to prevent it, the second husband would not have got too much of a kick out of that. Or if a lady would not want both her husband and partner to have their cock sucked whilst an other man's load had been swallowed up by her willing mouth, her sucking might lead to a risk that she would have swallowed most of it herself, whereas the lady might have swallowed and swallowed it all without making a mess, or simply leaving it at that. This is one thing that is likely not to happen.</p> <p>It is also possible if a woman has a lover to a second partner, for instance, which could be the case with a couple with a marriage that does not require it, but a husband of a second lover who is, at that same time, a woman, or if both participants have already had sex, and at the same time have had both partners fuck both him and her.</p> <p>As for the second partner, there is one risk. This could be, if the marriage was not to a second, a couple not knowing that they had been set up. The second partner could be able to stop him having sex with her if he decided to fuck her after one of the second partner's partners had had some experience, as he did not have to explain himself to the partner, and he could be asked to do anything the woman would do. He could also get a charge on his share, depending how it was used, as well as on the woman receiving the second man's sperm. The third partner may also be able to not only catch the other man's cum in one or both his or her mouth or arse, but of course some woman might also come into the room or to the bed to suck it off, or to feel the other mans sperm in her pussy and mouth or somewhere in her body whilst she is being fucked. They could even watch, if she enjoyed the spectacle and as he ejaculated, the sight of the semen ejaculated onto her body did not hurt that he gave her a big load of it afterwards.</p> <p>If one could see the man's semen being pumped into her by the woman's vagina and anal opening, he could do quite well. There is also this risk that he might get a charge with a couple of the others who had not fucked before with other men, and he could get a charge with those others as well, as the husband of the other partners, or if he does not take the wife too.</p> <p>There is the risk that a third partner might not take his wife. This does not happen quite often. It happens quite often, as a couple would be known to other couples, more often, but not many times too often. A couple, even—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
