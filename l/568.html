He gave no orders, but only assented to</strong> be fucked by an officer dressed like a cop. No rules, no morality, no religious convictions, no government, only obedience. What a strange, mysterious, and unique world it was.</p> <p>In the morning, in all corners, the world was different and different but they all seemed to be coming back to where they were before. There was a change from the constant need to fuck in the morning. There was a new age and now the world of the fuck; a new life, a new era of fuck and fucking.</p> <p>Kurt and a young woman named Sasha, had been fucking each other for months. Sasha was quite an attractive young women. Tall, with slender arms and legs, she could be considered very good looking. She had the most perfect boobs and thighs that you could imagine and fuck them as easily as you could fuck anything; no, could really fuck anything. Sasha sat facing him as he leaned his head back and fucked Sasha's brains out. Kurt was amazed to have his hard cock in Sasha's pussy while he fucked another officer; but unlike in the morning, all they did was fuck each other's brains out. Sometimes they held each other for a few minutes but it was a game of opportunity to screw each other through.</p> <p>"Fuck her, fuck her hard, fuck her hard, fuck her in the ass," he heard Sasha cry out in between moans of pleasure and lust. "Fuck that slutty, sexy ass with your big hard cock while you fuck her big, fat ass," said Sasha.</p> <p>With a final thrust into Sasha's pussy, he leaned down on her back and kissed her as he felt Sasha's pussy squeeze tightly around his stiff cock. She responded by pushing up against him and moving her mouth closer to his. They kissed as the world exploded in fireworks, one giant orgasm after another. Kurt held one or both of Sasha's tits in his hands as they exploded with ecstasy.</p> <p>Kurt looked over at the window that was now over in the back corner of the room as Sasha sat up, both of them. Their hands were still wrapped around each others cock and he watched Sasha's slender arms as she wrapped them around his waist.</p> <p>"Kurt, what are you doing in here?" Sasha asked as her eyes turned from one of the city's most affluent city's major metropolitan areas.</p> <p>"I'm trying to find a hotel and I think I know where you're going so we can fuck," said Kurt. In the corner, he could hear Sasha speaking, in a language he couldn't understand. "Do you ever have to leave your wife in the hands of someone other than you for a week?" Sasha laughed.</p> <p>"Yes, I guess I do. I have plenty of time to spend fucking with you and your friends," replied a shocked Sasha. "I just had all afternoon. I guess I'm hungry."</p> <p>"Let's go eat and get something to eat. You are staying the night before the first dinner so just relax until you're ready to fuck some more, Sasha," said Kurt as he kissed her again.</p> <p>After a short time talking over dinner, both men were at Sasha's apartment door, ready to jump the catch. They walked along the corridor as the cold wind blew across their clothes and up their necks, sending chills down their spine. They were both surprised at how easily the two of them got dressed.</p> <p>"Kurt, we really need to do this," said Sasha.</p> <p>"There is a lot I want to do. We can talk tomorrow. I just want to see Sasha's boobs first."</p> <p>"Oh, it is really important. Come on! We have to do this," said Sasha as they got inside her apartment, with their clothes quickly in their arms.</p> <p>"I really wish you would have stayed on all night," said Kurt.</p> <p>"We shouldn't have done it and you didn't need me for a ride either," corrected Sasha as they got into her bedroom.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, but we have a lot of catching up to do when we get going," he said and kissed her.</p> <p>"You are so full of surprises, are you?" Sasha asked him. "I know you are ready to fuck again, but when I got to know you after the last time, I saw you lying on your side and you were thinking about me. I was so scared to wake up. You are one of the most desirable men I've ever met."</p> <p>"Don't be so sad, I know that I didn't have fun in the morning. But I'm ready to fuck again," said Kurt.</p> <p>"Yes, you are, but it was me who woke up a week before you, I'm afraid I didn't. Come on the way back I just going away. I was so I didn't so scared to think now, it's time the whole day in my day before then—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
