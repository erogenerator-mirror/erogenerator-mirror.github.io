He always was always a smoker, and he knew that this was the one of his favorites that he smoked the most, but he never really expected to actually come across it. In an aside, he once wondered how many people lived in an apartment building, so the reason he preferred this late and empty space was that he lived in no one's apartments.</p> <p>With his eyes closed, he could see several couples making out outside, one couple fucking, the other fondling and sucking their partner. It was such an intimate sight that he decided before he came to this particular room that he was definitely going to keep quiet.</p> <p>After he lit a third cigarette, which was an unusual habit for him, James slowly pulled the curtains back, revealing that the room was indeed quite warm, and he couldn't sleep. Just thinking about it, he couldn't help thinking about fucking his sweet angeles—and that's what he'd rather be doing!</p> <p>Suddenly, he was interrupted by the sound of a doorbell chime ring. It was not very warm out, because there was an open window facing east, but rather was mostly clear inside. After knocking once, he realized that he was going to have to make do with what he saw, and it was time to get up!</p> <p>Taking his cigarette out and walking to the window, he opened the door to see the last person standing outside. For a moment, he imagined the eyes of the couple at the door, both of them staring up at him: a smile on their gorgeous smiles, as though they were on his shoulders and face. But he forced the image back as he stood there in the window, and he was too scared to talk. In fact, he barely had time to get an erection as much as he might have wanted to make it.</p> <p>Just then, another man's voice brought his attention back to him. "Hey, man, you out here again?" one of the men asked. This was their fifth time they were alone together since he had arrived, and they were enjoying what no one else knew.</p> <p>As he approached, the man who had just come in laughed as though he recognized him. "You can tell she has nothing on," the man explained. "Her roommate had to go to the doctor because of her weight, and they went a day without her."</p> <p>"What's the word 'fat'?" he asked the man. "She's really pretty—not model hot, just a little girl who has a hot butt and tits that just can't wait to be sucked! So many guys would love for her to be like that, but she's always a bit shy."</p> <p>"You see that guy sitting over there? She always has a bag on her but, once in a lifetime," the man said while pointing at someone else. "What are you—you—fucking?"</p> <p>Not waiting for him to answer him, the man continued his conversation for a moment, then said, "We're going to try for about 50 or so times a year. She likes to have a couple men use her and some boys fuck her as well."</p> <p>"FUCK!" the man exclaimed as he turned and quickly hurried off to the bathroom, which was across from James' room. This guy had the biggest dick of all the guys he was with, which must have been the reason he was there so often. James felt his dick swell as he looked at him, but he knew not to touch it. He could never admit to anyone on a regular basis that he wanted to fuck James Harthouse. It was just something that he had to endure.</p> <p>After walking outside for a while, the man who had just said that he saw the other man stand there, and he motioned to the other man to come closer. The man did so and stood there staring at James, who was now walking quickly out of the bathroom. "Where's my bag?" James asked. "There's no bag with you. I'm too old for this stuff anyway."</p> <p>"The whole place is empty," said the man, who could hardly contain his laughter as he stared at James. And James knew that he meant him, too, so he stepped toward him, extending his arm and waving him closer so that he could reach him. After several second, he wrapped his hand around James', saying, "Hey!"</p> <p>Looking down at him, James said, "It doesn't matter, so long as I can walk with you. I wouldn't mind sticking around here and getting some free advice from other people, but I might be too old for such." He turned him, so close that he could have to the man, and could practically touched, he said, "You have a word, if you'll give her the same with her, I'll do whatever you." With word with her "you," as many—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
