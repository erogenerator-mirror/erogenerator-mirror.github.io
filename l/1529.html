English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XII — HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES</h4><p><strong>Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having considered in some degree the causes of their being good or</strong> bad, we were quite frank and unadventurous in the discussion when I asked how they could be good or bad (in more technical terms of course)</p> <p>"How?" was not my original question. "How much do they give a guy and a girl?"</p> <p>"Yes. Why do you think?"</p> <p>"For that you can have anal as a present or not?"</p> <p>"I don't have an objection to anal," I said, "and if a guy will, by all means, fuck me there. But I don't know if it's best to offer, but I'm pretty sure that's a fair enough answer in itself.</p> <p>"What do you think?"</p> <p>I didn't have so much as a hint of a response to what I hoped to be my first answer.</p> <p>"If he doesn't like it, I guess I'll like it. I'm not going to say I like it at all."</p> <p>I laughed, "You know what to do next. You are not an ignorant girl, have you not already read more into my answers?"</p> <p>"If you really mean it, we can try."</p> <p>"I thought so."</p> <p>"You are absolutely right." A few moments later I had finished my coffee, and as I was about to get up I heard the unmistakeable squishy sound of a man's semen being released from my arse.</p> <p>I had to smile. "Who said I was a virgin?"</p> <p>The answer to that question was definitely different to where I would have originally been looking. There was no semen in his cock. It was a very healthy and active organ and as my sphincter continued to stretch I felt that it could be stretched any further. As the tip of anal intercourse progressed, my anal ring gradually began to expand. As the lubrication reached the widest part of my rectum it was impossible not to notice the increase.</p> <p>"Well I hope it doesn't hurt, don't you? There is so much I don't know about anal sex... or that's what I'm trying to say!"</p> <p>"Yes, but we really didn't do anything. We just took it out."</p> <p>"Yes, you did and that's all that counts. I don't really like to do that. It's too much of a novelty. Just take a slow break after you finish it in and I'll let you down."</p> <p>"Well we don't do much. I'm not going to try to make you stop."</p> <p>"Not that. I want to try it some more before you do it."</p> <p>"You've been here a while. I've hardly got any time. Don't be selfish."</p> <p>I couldn't stop. I had put on a show and I would look good afterwards. I also thought I was doing a good job of taking my cue from the conversation. I was looking forward to it.</p> <p>I had never been fucked in the rectum, but this was something new. I had never thought of it as being a 'possible cause'. Maybe this is the new age where it doesn't require that women understand that they are sexually capable only in certain ways. But I was also getting used to this.</p> <p>A good hard fuck didn't require the foreplay involved, but I would try to do something else.</p> <p>It was the afternoon sun, a late one. A beautiful day, sunny, free and warm and the temperature was over 65 cms. By the time the sun had broken over the horizon it was almost 7:00. I was wearing a black shirt, not really 'dressable' any more, and a pair of dark trousers in the shape that you sometimes see about to be 'dressable'. I had been wearing a pair of shoes at home, and a simple sleeveless blouse under black pants and a pair of dark stockings. The dress itself was quite casual about what it was, but that evening was warm and there was an almost-surrounding feeling that indicated that I wasn't wearing a bra.</p> <p>I felt a presence around me and, to my surprise, it was not me, but the girl of my dreams. She'd been wearing a very thin but elegant cocktail dress which was not very short, but certainly was not short enough to be short -- just enough so that I could see that she was wearing just a thong.</p> <p>"Oh my darling," I said, "You are absolutely beautiful and you are going to do just about anything for me tonight!"</p> <p>I held her close and kissed her, briefly, on the cheek as though we had done this all our lives and we were about to embark to embark on a date together.</p> <p>She giggled, "Well I suppose you don't."</p> <p></p> <p>"I suppose you don't suppose you like it,"</p> <p>" don't think you don't—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
