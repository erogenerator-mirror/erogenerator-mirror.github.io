Of Fronto, to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a</h4><p><strong>tyrannous king is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called [Eupatridas Gk.], i.e. nobly born, are in some sort incapable, or void of natural affection.</strong> I know for a fact that these things don't occur to a woman, especially when the husband is in bed with another man . . . and what they call "nord" is "Nude" (which I find is pronounced "Nuent') as the word for the man's privates, and there's a difference between them and naked people, and in fact, there's something about those "nude people". A man who's got a hard-on but is not getting off, not even a little. You just can't go on a night's prowl looking for "nude people". If someone is not a NND person, they're nubile, and most men can stand to see a glimpse of a woman's body. But when you don't have that, it's not an accident.</p> <p>So, if you're interested in a woman with a "nude" body, then "nude" is your ticket. If you are interested in other men who like to look, you may even love to fuck – both nudists. But in an entirely self-centered way, they are, in fact, "nude"!</p> <p>I used to come to this house to have a long discussion with a couple of my "nude friends". Of course, they were nude, and I knew about it. But no matter, as soon as we got to the bar, they both started undressing themselves, and I started to undress, and so did several others, all in various states of undress. It also made the bar feel like a sex-charged nightclub. The way the guys and the girls looked at each other, with one or two of those two smiling, turned me on, as did the women, in my opinion. When two people were feeling the other's body, they were showing off their bodies, not only to the customers, but to the bar as well.</p> <p>We had a couple of keg stands and some other things, so we had a full crowd of people that night. A lot of guys were looking at the girls, and some of them were trying to get a good look at my wife, while I kept my eyes locked on hers, and as many of the guys who I was working with were feeling her up.</p> <p>I wasn't a total prude, and I was already feeling adventurous about my wife, so I was glad that we were at the bar tonight. I wanted to get laid, and she wouldn't want a good one, so I would keep fucking her!</p> <p>We went back into the bar after a couple more drinks and some more flirting, and I thought I'd go get a room and lie with my wife. She said she wanted to go out and do something together, so we went into my bedroom, sat on the bed, and made love. I came in her and my dick went down her throat at first, then I pulled her up until she was looking down at my dick.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she said in a low voice. "I've been wanting to do that. It's so hard to hold on!"</p> <p>I thought she'd make another fool of herself with the way she looked at me, but it worked. She was like a little girl on a big high, making fun of me. When she had me off and had my cock out again, she was rubbing it up and down her slit, and I just couldn't seem to get it up.</p> <p>"So what do you think I have in mind?" I asked with my eyes looking at the ceiling. She looked at me with a look I could only describe as curiosity; a look that she was going to find out a lot.</p> <p>"You don't have to ask me," she said. "It's not that I don't want to have sex with you, it's just that you're so beautiful that I want you, too! And I want you, I just want you!" she almost screamed, then she kissed me hard as she pushed me back on the bed. I fell back with her on top of me in a second, but then she got up on her knees and moved her slit along my shaft, taking the head of my cock in her tight little hole and then sliding back there, so she got the whole length in.</p> <p>"Aaaaah," she said in a low voice, "now your dick is fucking my pussy!" she pulled her cunt down my cock, and I was in. She was not wearing any panties, and I felt the wet patch on her pussy, with my hard-on disappearing into the crack of her ass.</p> <p>"Now that's more like it," she said, kissing me again. "I put my hands on her hips and pulled up, and up, as she slid all the bed. I was fucking her as fast as she could, and then I could.
