When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Weston’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For the present, he could</strong> not do one thing to change her mind, and so he wrote:</p> <p>Dear Sir,</p> <p>Would I be permitted to take your virginity as a mere matter of habit? If you are married, it is the best way.</p> <p>For your health,</p> <p>Paul.</p> <p>Her heart beat hard in her chest.</p> <p>Her hand went to her vagina; it was throbbing again. This was going to be it.</p> <p>She remembered her wedding gown. Her mother would have been thrilled. No, it was better that it had been. She remembered that he was all she had to offer. She remembered that it would be her first time with her husband, and not just his. In fact, he had said that he was the one. She had told him that she wanted him to fill her, and would love every second of it. She felt guilty for lying to her husband's best friend. It was her fault.</p> <p>Mrs. Weston was in a hurry. Her hand touched her vagina as if she had done this the week before her wedding day. She had touched it this time and it caused a sudden surge between her legs. It had been her first time to do anything about anything and anyone sexually. A quick finger on her wet, throbbing clitoris had brought her mind back to the present and to the day.</p> <p>As a result, it was an orgasm that would be remembered more clearly this trip. There would be no need for condoms. The boy had gone home, in favor of using something more conventional, and was not a substitute.</p> <p>It was not Mrs. Weston the first time after all. Of course, it wasn't her, but it probably should have been. She was so young. She wasn't sure of her husband. She was certain that he would have had sex with her. It was not just her. It was one of the best pleasures she had ever given her husband. She wanted her husband to be with her again this time.</p> <p>She had made the choice by lying to him. That would be adultery. That would be cheating. There just didn't seem to be another way. She could not. She was tired of lying. She felt guilty. She felt guilty and she felt stupid. She felt embarrassed and stupid and she felt embarrassed and stupid because she was ashamed. And so that was the moment that had become her greatest sin for life—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
