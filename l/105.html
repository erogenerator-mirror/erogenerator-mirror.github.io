THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY</h4><p><strong>We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way: “Have you</strong> and your lovely wife, the one who helped raise me and my daughter, the one who took my penis into her tight, hot and sexy rectum?””</p> <p>The letter did more than just get me hard, “Have you and your daughter been watching us?” Then the letter also ran into that. That led the next four years, with me getting laid in each of them. They also had sex with me whenever they wanted. After they were done, they asked me about my sexual experiences. I was astonished and I was glad to hear that a number of things were going on in their lives so that I could relate, but I could not tell them about anything of consequence. It had a lot of implications. And when I found out about it, I found out that when I did something that I did not approve of, the two of them would get a slap in my face. I thought that that would be as good a time as any to put something in it. So I began to do it. At the end of the year, they were planning to meet me for dinner. That is what they invited me to. I'm not sure where I heard the words come from, but I was sure they were not about something serious. And now I wonder about the implications of those words.</p> <p>My wife and I were a couple and we have been to parties, though one time, the bride and groom got married, so that is what we do with each other. The only people that we have ever had sex with is their spouses, and the only people that have ever been in a relationship with a woman that we do it with is our spouse. We do know that my wife and I have sex together; it is all I know. But even more, we are in a relationship and in a marriage relationship. And we have become very good friends. There are also a few reasons that I know not to believe that.</p> <p>Now I can hear my wife being fucked by a black man, sometimes twice a day, some three times a day. He has a fat cock. He also has a mean black hand. I know, even though she is being fucked by a white man, she is also fucking a black man. There are certain things that are just not acceptable in the marriage and I can't understand. My wife's idea of adultery is to fuck a man or black on his first date with her. Or, she will have to be on top. Sometimes a man has to kiss or lick a woman during sex. Some of my wives will always be on the bottom. Other days the men will just kneel in the middle of the living room with a man kneeling in front of them. Then one or two will suck on the men and some have to suck on the woman, other times it is the men suck on the woman. That can be bad when married men do that.</p> <p>My wife is a good and happy wife. She is a good wife anyway. You may wonder at our behavior when we are in a relationship. When we first started dating, her and I both liked sex. And even though we tried to get more and more sex with each other in our first year together, we only got half of it. We were not as enthusiastic about sex as we are now, but I sure wasn't disappointed when I saw the erection going up that time. One of my wife's friends gave us oral sex before I was married. And when she did the same with me, she gave me a blow job. We are both still a little unsure of that stuff, but at least we have more common tastes. But that is the way it is in love. There are no real diseases.</p> <p>Your wife really likes sex when we are with other men. I do too. I don't have any worries with her. I can be with anyone. And at least I can do it whenever I want, and at least sometimes I will try to get married and have kids. And if we are getting married or having children or whatever, I also don't complain that she is taking care of me. And we try to make our sex life better. We have tried to enjoy ourselves together. My wife doesn't try to keep things private with me about my sex life. I have found that she prefers not to have anything to do with sex. We enjoy ourselves very much. We both do like the sex and neither of us really wants to start doing anything with anyone else.</p> <p>In our relationship, my wife and I both liked the sex as much as I do. However, I told my wife about a number of things about our life in a way that I do not like. Like my wife never mentions that she has cheated on me. In other situations, she is very understanding of the marital fidelity, but not being a slut. She is not in the same sex slave as I am. She likes me with her husband, but does not as she does a man, she—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
