The streets, shuttered for the repose</strong> of his new girlfriend. He lay on the grass, his heavy balls hung low, and rested on his thighs as he rested.</p> <p>It was a strange way to be in love. When there was no other emotion, was there no passion?</p> <p>In his mind, was that any one of them? Was he now their lover?</p> <p>In his mind, was that the lover who had brought him up?</p> <p>In his mind, was he the love of his life from now on?</p> <p>Would that love be enough for him? Would he not give it to her?</p> <p>He pondered the question for a long while, deciding that he could give the answer, without the answer being all. Perhaps something else, but he wasn't going to ask the question to himself. He liked to be the one who was going to be the one to love. He wanted the answer. He was always going to want her. Always will be.</p> <p>He wondered what her name was? What her face looked like?</p> <p>"Hey, can we do it now?" He said after a moment, surprised that he heard his name. He wasn't sure if she was waiting for his reply. It had been a long time since he heard such a thing.</p> <p>"Hurry up," she teased, pushing out a huge laugh. She was teasing him. "You're early."</p> <p>It wasn't a great joke when he was late. It wasn't a great joke when he wasn't already on the brink of cumming. It was something he had done once before, and it wasn't all it had done. He was the man, the boy, the kid, and the child of a couple. He hadn't even thought about it yet. He wasn't even sure he wanted to do it.</p> <p>"I'm late" he said at last, sounding exasperated.</p> <p>"Yeah, fuck me now" she laughed again. She got up, grabbed him by the arm. "We'll just have to do it in my pussy then. Just don't go soft and put one into my ass."</p> <p>He was stunned again, not knowing whether he could handle getting hard in her pussy. He had hoped she would ask for anal, but in here, he knew it would be difficult. He had had it up her ass once, when he had been on her bottom.</p> <p>"Not so hard now, sweetie. You know you might find the pleasure of my cunt, as you will," she said with the same sly smile as his own. "In the meantime, just go ahead and come inside me and feel my tight little pussy right now that I like."</p> <p>What the fuck, he thought as he got off the grass and made his way to the nearest alley. He couldn't believe what he had to do and his heart pounded in his chest. He reached her on the way by, his cock still semi-hard from the fucking he had given her, his mind flashing into thoughts of the time that she had asked the question, how long was he going to fuck her?</p> <p>"I don't want you to cum in me," she said. "I want it in my mouth." She grabbed him and pulled him through the doorway. "C'mon. C'mon. Go in there and feel my cunt."</p> <p>When she came inside, he rushed to her, trying to explain his own fears and desires, hoping that she would know. Maybe she'd understand and stop his actions on her back. Maybe she wouldn't take it up the butt of his cock if he said he was sorry for the time that they had together. He knew he didn't want to get into any trouble and he did not feel like going into her ass right away. The thought made him shudder and his eyes grew moist with tears.</p> <p>"What's wrong," she asked. He looked at her, at her face and up her skirt. "You didn't cum in her ass, did you? You didn't cum in an ass?" He didn't know whether to be surprised or mortified, but she was the type of lady who was never wrong to talk to him about anything in the way of a man's cock being the reason he had not started yet in her cunt. What man hadn't done that before.</p> <p>"A lot. Sorry if I came in you, just in case." He said this without feeling better and began to get on his knees, feeling dizzy.</p> <p>"Don't, I want to see you," she said, pulling him up into a standing position. She pulled his arms behind him, cinching them together, and placed them on his back. "Just sit on it," she told him before taking his hands and putting them against the ground. He sat down again, looking down at her face to face. "This isn't a virgin hole. You're a virgin in the floor. And that's whereâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
