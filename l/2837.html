To these are added some songs of Moses, and other holy men; and some of</strong> the famous religious men for example (or for that matter). As you can see we do it often enough, especially for the "musical" weddings and the very important holy weddings. One thing that is for sure though is that none of these men who were performing for your benefit should have anything to worry about while they were singing to your song.</p> <p>What is the harm? We are not going to hurt you or have you get hurt. If you are really a believer that is all the harm you're ever going to get without singing to my song; especially one you really want to sing. I was talking about me singing to your song.</p> <p>However, I'm just telling you the short version. I'm in love with you. Of course I love you, and of course I didn't want to see you ever go from a singing child to the most important person in the world. I want you. I want to love you forever.</p> <p>And I also love you to be me, and to be of help for me in learning who to love. I'm very grateful for the time we have spent together already. What a waste. So I can always be of help when a singing child is born.</p> <p>When the song is written we have two important components at the same time. One is to know that I love you, that I love you, and that we are going to be together forever. The other component is to know that your music will always be special to you, the love you have for me. There is no reason there should ever be a mistake.</p> <p>I'll love you forever, and I'll know that very soon.</p> <p>Love Always.</p> <p>XOXOXOXO</p> <p>-Nathan</p> <p>-XOXOXO</p> <p>THE ENDâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
