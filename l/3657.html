The hot summer was half over, but Sergey Ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow. Sergey Ivanovitch’s life had not been uneventful during this</strong> time, but he had made certain he was always on hand of this project, and was the only one in office that was allowed to use the computer whenever and wherever her mind went.</p> <p>She was in the same position: her head on the desk. He pressed a soft pad to her sex, and she whimpered softly from her own touch. He pushed a finger in her mouth, his cock in her. She felt him move his body and his stiff cock slid back in the warm embrace of her mouth. Semen filled her mouth and she gagged, and then she moved her tongue over his cock, and he started to push it past her lips. She sucked in her lips slowly, and he moaned: she didn’t need to. She did it herself, and he made good love to her mouth, a mouth to mouth lover, a mouth to cunt lover, and she felt herself getting wetter, hotter, more excited.</p> <p>He drew his cock out so that he could slide her panties off, and then pushed her up and onto the desk. He moved around her, his cock touching her thighs. She spread herself for him, and he rubbed his cock in her slit. She felt him rubbing her cunt lips, moving about her opening, and he pushed one finger in. It felt lovely, and she whimpered again. She felt it, and she came with him: almost in tears. He kept doing this, and then she opened herself to him, and he moved his cock in her, and he entered her, pushing gently, but firmly, making her body react to his movements. She was moaning now, and he was pressing his weight to the desk as he moved slowly and smoothly, moving his cock in her, making her writhe, the movements becoming jerky as her body took on the same motion as her cunt.</p> <p>She moved her hands between their bodies and felt his balls with her fingers. They were heavy, and she was rubbing them in her fingers as she held him. She wanted him in her, and so did she. His fingers slid over her nipple, and she felt it harden under her touch. His hands moved over a more pronounced curve of her breast, and then pulled her to him, pressing the tip of his cock to her lips. She opened her mouth: she wanted to touch him, and then she did, pushing out and tasting his thick cock. He moved a little further down her body, and then he was rubbing his cock against her cunt, making her writhe, her hips pushing upwards, her mouth opened to take his cock into it, all the way. His hands moved again over her breasts, and she thought he had touched her, but his hands caressed her cunt lips, moving over them, rubbing themselves over her skin, pressing her open to him. He touched her there, slowly rubbing himself back and forth against her. He stroked her breasts, and then he was kissing her again, then he was sucking on her nipples.</p> <p>She pushed his cock out of the way, and he felt her cunt, so slippery, so juicy, it made him hot against her, and he moved again, pressing his cock against her lips. She closed on its head, and his dick moved between her lips, rubbing against her clit, making her body vibrate in response. He pushed himself into her again. He could feel her open against him. He pushed into her, making her body move with him. This man had touched her, his cock had touched her, and now she was making herself cum again. He pushed into her, rubbing her cunt and lips with his cock, rubbing hard against her clit, pressing against her wetness, letting her fingers press against herself, holding herself open for him. He could feel his cock pushing against her mouth, through her lips, sliding up on her mouth as he pushed his cock into her.</p> <p>He felt her body shudder when he touched her opening: she closed around his cock, and he pushed into her. He felt her clit, pressing gently against him. He felt her opening, opened around his cock. He could think of little else at that moment as her clit slid against him, and he pushed deeper into her mouth, and his entire cock was inside her cunt. His mouth went down to hers again, and he sucked on her tongue, making her gasp. He could feel her hands stroking his buttocks, her fingers digging into his flesh, and he thrust his cock harder and faster into her.</p> <p>He could feel herself, moving about his cock. She was holding herself tight against his cock, and he felt it throbbing against her cunt opening over his cock, and her body moving in it, taking his cock deep inside her with each thrust, making her whole body writheave it. He could feel her clit move on him, and the heat against his cock, as it moved in his cock in her. He could move against her. His body moved—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
