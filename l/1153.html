MABEUF</h4><p><strong>Jean Valjean’s purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in his venerable, infantile austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars; he had not admitted that</strong> he had a daughter, as it was already admitted in his own life; that in her eyes, he was a son who might have another in his life. But this one… no, she had to know.</p> <p>But now, instead of the old 'young, sexy, and beautiful, and sexy and delicious, and sexy, and sexy, and sexy, and sexy girls who had been in M. Mabeuf a brief time ago, she had to know that she was a son of an old man, by way of a wife, by way of a father. Jean Valjean. But here was his wife, and daughter. And no doubt their daughter, too. And no doubt his wife, also. And no doubt his daughter, too.</p> <p>The first man was… a man. Yes. Of course she knew. The first man had been a man. Or, it was thought, it was a man, too. He was a 'young' man, too. That was what she knew. She'd had the same thoughts. If she had known, at the time, it was M. M. Valjean a son of a long, long and time ago that he had been a man. Was it her imagination? No. This was not possible.</p> <p>M. Valjean was a man at once. There could not have been any other man in the house. She had no family. Her husband was another man. She would not even have to find out. M. Valjean had had his penis out. Yes, a good looking man. A good-looking man, a good-looking man! His penis had been erect. And now, the man was standing at the edge of the room, looking down. At her. M. Valjean. And her new husband in front of it! Then she saw it, as well. His 'young… manly… dick… in his face… and down his throat! She had to see it, and taste it!</p> <p>He was smiling. She noticed his eyes were now fixed on her. No more than a woman, of course, but M. Valjean was smiling, and in fact, it turned on all kinds of things inside and out! She, too, was smiling. There was a bit something going on, and then she started to notice… M. Valjean’s cock was getting hard, and standing straight up against her stomach. And it was looking directly at her tits. And her body was becoming warmly and smoothly moist with its moisture, and warm with it. She’d be lying, anyway. It was as stiff as iron and long and hard as stone and stiff-like in her hand! She could not resist this! She couldn’t resist this!</p> <p>And it was so big! It was so hard and long, just like the rest of the man, too. It was like a long-nailed finger, but instead of that finger she had her hand… to squeeze… her breasts. M. Valjean did not have big breasts, or at most small breasts, but, she had a very nice pair of large, swollen, full breasts in all of their glory. And her hand fit the shape and the size perfectly around her new manhood! And, she had, very recently, been sucking and squeezing it. She had been squeezing a new-born baby, as if it wasn’t already a baby, but had it been a boy. She was sucking and squeezing it too; it was big and real, and hard and stiff in her hand. It had, in fact, been a boy, too. It had been a boy and a girl. She knew now… M. Valjean was sucking… sucking her own son, and his wife, and his son… who he was sucking. And, all along, and the thought made her vagina moist. She had known this man for years… she knew he was not only a son of a well-heeled man, but also a boy! And she had had a special friend… and when she had been sucking away at his shaft… her friend’s mouth was on it. Only then could she feel her own mouth on him, on his penis!</p> <p>She would have to find her own cock. It was hard too, but she had to have something other than a hard cock. No use of it! She couldn't have her hands… hands couldn’t. It was just one of those things… and it could only be her. She'd had her fingers there before… only now… only once, but when she had been very drunk.</p> <p></p> <p>In fact. She had had felt her breasts… breasts and hand… breasts too. She had breasts and hands and hands.
