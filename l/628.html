It was an autumn night with dark purple clouds, but no rain. The</strong> stars twinkled; thunder sounded above the clouds above the tents. The army marched with the dawn formation, but in the evening, there was a little light.</p> <p>The sound of heavy-topped explosions outside the tents echoed through the night and the light from overhead shone down on the tent. From the darkness the air crackled and smoke rose and dissipated into the night. Smoke rose to the sky then rose to a deep and beautiful shade of blue.</p> <p>A figure was on the ground, a foot in front of him. Some men stood holding his hands to his sides. He could see, and smell, the smell of an engine and heavy smoke. His head snapped forward and was thrown forward by the smoke. He lost his balance, his shoulders and torso slammed on the tents. His feet were kicked from the camp-fire and crashed on the tent's carpet. The tent groaned and he fell unconscious on the ground.</p> <p>He staggered through the night toward the tent. He woke up groggy from the smoke the day before and the dizziness. He could hear some light banter being said, but he couldn't make heads or tails of it. He awoke in the pitch dark and took stock of his surroundings. He could see his own tent, the only one in sight. He had the tent empty. In his own tent, however, he found a wetness in his pants. The smell of the campfire was stronger! A woman stood next to a fallen pile of cushions. The woman looked to be in her late thirties, and she had a long and dark-haired man lying on top of her. When she bent down to talk the man groaned and pushed her away. She was not upset. The man's erection was clearly visible behind the pants.</p> <p>Then he spotted another man, in the midst of his tent's light. He saw the woman's face, but that was the mystery. The man was tall and thin and had broad auburn hair. The man smiled when the woman opened his tent flap and stepped inside. The tent's flap did not close completely, but the flap's edge was partially open. The man's penis and testicles bulged the fabric of his clothing and lay on the carpet. The man did not move or move, but his penis jerked as the woman entered him.</p> <p>The woman bent over him and whispered something directly in his ear, which he could hear. He groaned and pushed the man away, so she could stand back up. She smiled and stood back up, then walked to where her body stood. Her hands went to what appeared to be her sex, which she was fingering and rubbing. As they walked they moved closer to one another. They stared at each other. The woman's hand wandered toward his erection, which had swollen to fully stiff now. She stroked it and rubbed it vigorously.</p> <p>As they stepped past each other they came together. The man's hands pushed the woman's head hard down onto his penis.</p> <p>They froze. The man held her tight against his penis for a long time. He groaned and then moaned in satisfaction as he emptied into her mouth. She quickly stood up and turned around. She had a smile on her lips that said she wanted more. She pulled down her panties and then her skirt. When she turned back towards his tent, a thin line of wetness ran down her leg. She grinned and walked through the campsite into the darkness. Her hips moved seductively as she walked, her arms moved up, and then down, as she turned into the darkness of the tent.</p> <p>The woman left the tent and approached the nearest man. She looked down and saw her hand inching its way up his thigh. He groaned and his body shook as she touched him there. Her hand pushed against him and she could feel her own hot excitement. His hand grabbed her hip and pulled her towards him. He was too embarrassed to do anything. He had just fucked the woman. He was too embarrassed to do anything about it. The woman looked to the man, who was now standing against the bed, and then back at her.</p> <p>She opened his pants and began to caress him. Her hand was warm from the light from the tent. She stroked the shaft and rubbed the glans and then began to lick it. She licked the shaft of the man. He groaned and pushed her head back and down. His body trembled from the intensity of her pleasure. When she licked his penis from base to tip, she pushed two fingers into his butt and finger-fucked him faster with her other hand.</p> <p>The man began to move his hips. Her fingers inside of her pussy, his hand on his chest and he began moving her body. The woman was now on his penis began moving her body up and his. She continued to the man's the bed, as she rubbed her back andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
