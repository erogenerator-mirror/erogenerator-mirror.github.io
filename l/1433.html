Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon</strong> of fire blazing. My heart was beating so quickly I thought I might faint.</p> <p>"Are you all right?" I heard a man's voice ask.</p> <p>"Yes, we're all okay, actually. I don't know how we're all going to manage," another voice laughed. "We have to save some of the planet's water."</p> <p>"I heard that," I said, as he took me in his arms. I was still naked and I could feel him grow hard beneath me, the size of him still filling me. "How can we be together if we're naked?"</p> <p>"As much as we want to," another male voice said, "we'll both die!"</p> <p>My heart started beating so hard I was about to burst. It felt as if something was ripping from my stomach and I tried to think of a way to hold onto the strength of my consciousness while I was overwhelmed by my body. "Who said we're going to die?" I asked.</p> <p>"It is you," the other male said.</p> <p>"But I wish I knew," I said. "I mean I wish I didn't really know what I was missing."</p> <p>I felt his arms tighten about my body while the hand at the back of my head pulled me to his warm mouth. He sucked on my nipples and nipped at the sensitive skin between my breasts as he thrust his hips up against me. I was still dazed from my own orgasm, but not for long because I was soon on the edge of another one.</p> <p>The man on my left reached between my legs and began rubbing my folds gently and teasingly. "There's so much I wanted to say, but the words just came out of my mouth," he murmured as he slid two fingers into me. "So much," he added as he slid a third finger inside me. "So much."</p> <p>Two hands began to slide over my body. Slowly they slid down until they reached my legs and their hands cupped my buttocks. Slowly, and so slowly, they slid further down until the tops of the hands rested on my ass. I opened my mouth to moan but only heard a groan from one of the men nearby. The hands were moving faster now. The fingertips that had been teasing my thighs, began to part my labia and probe and explore as I was suddenly aware of the wetness starting to seep from deep inside me. And as quickly as they were entering, they were withdrawing and the moisture made them glisten like they were coated in a mirror.</p> <p>I turned to look at the face of the man on my left as he bent over me with his erection now protruding from beneath his own jeans. The smile on his face warmed my heart and made my knees go weak. "Do you like?" he whispered. "God," I murmured.</p> <p>Before I had a chance to respond his lips were on mine. His arms went around my body and he pulled me against him with one hand and reached up with the other to hold me in his lap. His lips were soft and I tasted the salt of his mouth against my lips and his breath and his tongue.</p> <p>As our lips parted I let my hand drop to his erection and his mouth followed that action. I reached around and found the zipper on the front of his pants and unzipped them. His body was stiff and I pulled it out from under him and reached inside his pants for his cock. It was thick and hard and his head almost burst through the opening in the front of his underwear when I touched it. I didn't realize there was some pain involved. In the past, I had only used sex toys on men and I had never considered the idea of making love to a penis. I didn't consider the fear that I would hurt him. Not yet.</p> <p>I felt the pressure of his hand on my breast as he cupped the softness and pressed it down. I let my hand slide down his body to its base and then pulled the fabric over his erection and slowly up until it was over halfway up his thigh. As I looked down my body, I saw that the front of his underwear was soaked with pre come. I wanted to take off the panties and just have him between my legs. But a hand grasped my breast and gently squeezed and twisted my nipple as he continued to hold the other and began to kiss his way up my neck. The pressure of the hand holding my breast shifted slightly at the last second and I realized I must be wet inside because the other one was covered in wetness that had made my vagina.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhh," I moaned. "Now it's my turn." The hand on my breast slid down until it rested between my thighs. I felt fingers sliding them down the front of his underwear until I found a hard hardening tip. I found the hairless skin and pulled up to the fabric covering of his erection and rubbed gently rubbedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
