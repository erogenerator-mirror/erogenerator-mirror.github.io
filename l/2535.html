Commutative therefore, they place in</strong> proportion to the other, and are considered as separate from those of the third kind. As for Geometricall, I believe it is a workable combination, both mentally and literally," the doctor smiled. "Now, we shall begin. I will lay down your sheets, and lie down."</p> <p>"Of course, madam. I will be gentle," she smiled up at him, kissing his cheek, her nipples pressing against his chest as she lay on her side. "I will be back in a moment," she winked, giving his hand a lingering kiss. "I have a meeting with some people from a town called Fairground." A meeting with a bunch of the town's most influential members today, and one of them would be her husband.</p> <p>"Well, I haven't quite arrived," William said, feeling it his cock had stiffened to a semi hard, but still very uncomfortable state. "I just need to get a quick fuck, I promise," he grinned, moving his arm as he sat on the edge of the bed, and moving off toward the door, "you can have it if you want, if they wouldn't mind being with a guy like me." "That's an offer I can't refuse. I am really looking forward to it," she replied, moving over to him and standing up in the bathroom. "You will be ready once I'm ready to come," she said, her fingers running through his hair as she took his cock in her hand. "Will you have it?" she asked, nodding towards his cock through his robe.</p> <p>"I will have it, I promise." His cock was still hard from her fingering, hard for her to see. She quickly got to her knees as she wrapped her fingers around the thick cock. "Well?" she asked, wrapping her hand around his cock to get it in her mouth.</p> <p>"Well, what?" William asked as his wife sucked on his cock. He hadn't had it in his mouth yet today, and he would be ready to do anything soon, including fucking her, but he never enjoyed it as much as he did her right now.</p> <p>"If you really really can't bring yourself to fuck me, I'm ready to come," she said as she took his cock out of her mouth.</p> <p>"I guess I could try, but you're better than that, anyway." William said, moving to the edge of the bed where he waited. He watched as she stood up, turning to her left, then to his right, and then over to her left, her knees up to her chest, giving him a clear view up her dress. She paused for a moment, then came over to the bed, and leaned over in a kneeling position with her hands on his chest, pressing her tits against his chest, and her hands to his cock.</p> <p>"I have something to tell you, sweetie." William turned his head as he spoke. "I will never again have a fantasy about fucking anyone else," William smiled. "I wouldn't expect you to take my wife's place in my life," he chuckled.</p> <p>"I want to be able to please you like you have never pleased me before, sweetie," she smiled, pushing her tits back against his chest. "You know, that's a lot to be said. I don't think I can make it, yet."</p> <p>"Don't worry, dear," she smiled. "I can make it all better than that."</p> <p>William nodded. "How do you know you won't have a heart attack?" he said.</p> <p>"I can't talk for very long," she replied. "I want you to come, sweetie, and you better do it. I want you to enjoy yourself, as you never have before, because you have already experienced it," she said, reaching down to press a finger up into his ass.</p> <p>"You're right! That's so good," he groaned. "I'll never forget this day, no matter what it is," he said.</p> <p>"And you will never forget it, too," she smiled.</p> <p>"So far, I'm more than okay?" he smiled. "You're the best."</p> <p>"Then there should be more," she smiled, then pushed herself into a sitting position. "I think it is time for me to clean up and to get dressed. Are you ready to get in the shower before we miss the meeting?"</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>William hurried to go shower himself. It was a warm evening, and he enjoyed sitting in a soft, warm washcloth tub. As soon as he stepped into the shower, he was startled to hear someone standing in the glass door of his bathroom just a few feet behind him. "Mrs. Are you're back there is my darling." She will be dear? Is love for youâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
