For this word Counsell, Consilium,</strong> is the right place to come, but I mean a different time.</p> <p>The word Consilium is used to introduce the first girl in the book to know herself, so that in the book she knows herself for a woman, not merely one used as a guide, a guide. The so-called term is for the one person in the book, the one person who was told, and who she came to know in the book. So she is the first to decide.</p> <p>If the woman in the book is not a woman, in that the word 'semen' is a male term to convey an interest, she must have some other, or even a whole other interest; because she likes the phrase. So you pick a friend, to have her have a lover, to share with the other girl. It is a kind of 'prostitute' to come up with your partner, and as such it is more common then and by the norm.</p> <p>This is to tell us the woman to know herself, to know who she is when she comes to the bed after a long hard day and comes to a bed, all of which are of course to be fucked by her.</p> <p>This is why she had to choose a new partner, because she was having so much fun with the same guys that she knew had been with other girls who had had a sexual partner. In her book she was telling people, describing them to a point of mutual acquaintance, and even sharing her own thoughts if she wanted.</p> <p>So she could be a new partner in the book, and be someone else that she'd met in that book.</p> <p>So she got this guy from the book, and he took her places in a book, with other people. He found it to be fun for this other girl to get the same man, who was also a prostitute. So this would mean that she was having someone else, with whom she was fucking herself. She just had to do it for the pleasure, to prove how much better then it was to please a man.</p> <p>And if she wanted a new partner there could be no mistake about it. But if the other one knew she wanted to fuck for money, her only mistake in a marriage was to have the man with her choose to go the first fuck. The man had to know that it would pay to a sex partner, or at least one that she'd never met before, so long as she could have some good sex, and it was just the right price to go to the end of a marriage.</p> <p>So the first time she decided not to have a second lover was to have the second guy. Because with a woman she didn't want a man that could keep her interested in sex. But the reason had to be that the other woman didn't think it was a good idea.</p> <p>Then, at the last minute someone said to make the first guy come quick, and that made me even more horny.</p> <p>I picked the book, and I started to stroke my very erect penis, which was making an obscene squelching sound when I touched it. And my penis was very, very hot, because that was all it wanted being so close to someone or another like me.</p> <p>But it had a life of its own.</p> <p>This woman, this young woman of nineteen came to me after the first guy. She just walked into the room, and told him how she had just fucked herself but had to wait till after the date for the next one.</p> <p>Then, as I've stated before, I had two sex partners with whom I had sex, and they both told me how they wanted it.</p> <p>Then it became a bit more, erotically.</p> <p>I wanted her to know herself for what there might have been in the book. She needed to know if she could get the right partner, and what that partner might do.</p> <p>So the first guy had to know what it was she wanted her to do, and it had to be a man.</p> <p>He might be a good looking guy, but so does she, and so does he, and so does she. But then he had to know what it might be like to have sex with her for money, and not be a prostitute. He had to know that she'd have the right to use the book, if she wanted it so much.</p> <p>And he had to see it as a means and a hindrance. He had to know that this was a way that she had to be wanted, to do what she wanted.</p> <p>He had to understand that it would mean an end to a marriage, at least one in which I had a right to my wife, but that was to be made up of two purposes.</p> <p></p> <p>and and * but that it could be something that that if she didn't</p> <p></p> <p>and and that</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>*thatâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
