The Preparation</h4><p><strong>When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was. He did</strong> not know whether it happened to be inside there, but he could hear a few things, mostly the moaning of someone in particular. Maybe the woman who was screaming as the orgasm tore through her body came to her in a way that he wanted to feel his tongue in her vagina. And that might be enough for him to come!</p> <p>That was all it took. As soon as he ejaculated down her throat, the lady in the dressy white dress that had just been giving him those sweet lips and long tongue wrapped around his cock. The other woman also ejaculated into his waiting mouth. "Don't you dare stop!" "That was fucking crazy!"</p> <p>He would not stop for her, though. He would continue until she was satisfied with his load. That woman was about to receive his whole load, just as she had done. He could sense that his orgasm would be a big load and he would not finish until the women got to know that he actually came. He was ready to keep going, but the lady was just a little too excited to let him up for a second orgasm. The other woman was obviously just to satisfy his curiosity regarding her sexual desires. "I can't," she said, "all the ladies are to busy to see how much I can give them, which is just too fucking big!"</p> <p>The only other lady who could come to that conclusion was the one on the balcony, also to stay occupied while he kept going. But there were others in the room right away, too, and he kept going for a short while, as if it was only a business of the hotel. But when he was at last finished, he went straight to the shower. The female assistant would not believe it, but he got lucky enough to even be inside them.</p> <p>When the other woman saw him enter her room, she was already at the window. Her breasts were almost out in the sunlight as a result of the breeze coming through her dress, so he could look at her, without feeling awkward at walking alone in the hotel as he usually kept his own space. The other girl on the bed, already naked, was there also. She also saw him in a way that no lady should see him. But her body was clearly visible to him in all her natural beauty and if she were to look at him, she could surely see the signs of his semen as his penis twitched.</p> <p>"That's no good! That was just too intense!" She couldn't even look at him, even if her brain was still trying to remember what had actually happened to him when he ejaculated inside her. She was simply too embarrassed. He did like that feeling that he was getting turned-on by her, as he felt that she was making him so hot. But to do away a perfectly good job like that was wrong.</p> <p>At least, the lady knew where her friend's hands were. He put his fingers in her hand and helped her out of the dress, then he led her to her own bed. "If it's not too much trouble, we could fuck for the last time." And now that he'd seen that she was quite horny, he wanted to play with her as well. He was so eager for that sensation, to be allowed to touch her for the first time, to have sex with her in such a manner in a hotel room. That she was so open-minded about it was the most thrilling moment of his life. It was as though he was trying to please her in any way that he could get her to participate in it, and he was going to make love to her just as he thought he had the other ladies. "You don't have to do that if you don't want to," he had told the lady with his voice as he tried to push his penis back into her vagina just a short bit. "You don't have to put yourself away to make a woman climax because you can't."</p> <p>He really, really wanted to show her everything that he could get her to do for other women, though, if the other women were to find out that maybe it would be easier to have sex in such a way, in the same way that he had done earlier for his own lady friend in the bathroom.</p> <p>"Well, let me," said the woman that had been sucking on his penis. She had been very excited herself; she had probably been thinking over the way that he was feeling about her already, as she had been trying to get him to do such things. "That's better." At least it was a woman who had been quite good at what she was doing, and she enjoyed it a lot better than he did. "Hurry up and fuck me!" she said. He'd only been waiting for that for her, since he had his chance, since it's a good feeling was better than he could have her sucking on his own pussy. She would like that.
