All day it had been</strong> a tense summer. The air was filled with smoke, orange and green and they could clearly recognize each and every soldier in the group. Many of the soldiers had already arrived during the day, and everyone was at peace and there was no question how much the soldiers appreciated their cooperation.</p> <p>At midnight they were standing on the base of the Krásnoe, and they were met by a group of soldiers, surrounded by a dozen military personnel.</p> <p>“Hello, my lady” Colonel Lucius Zbor whispered to her, “the party”.</p> <p>She turned to the crowd. “Yes, my lady” they cheered. Everyone was talking excitedly to one another and cheering everyone that was in the crowd. As soon as they recognized her they had to be quiet. “Why don’t we have a celebration feast?” The soldiers asked her.</p> <p>She looked to a group of soldiers. “Oh, um...” She began.</p> <p>“Come on, let’s go,” a soldier exclaimed. They had led her down the steps. Lucius Zbor walked them to a building behind the base, away from the Kr´snoe.</p> <p>It was a tiny camp, with a number of bunk beds, with a table, and a few chairs. As they took their seats Colonel Lucius Zbor ordered the soldier who had been the leader in the formation to sit next to them. The soldier began to cry. The soldiers were all around her, so she put her hand over the soldier’s. Their tears covered their faces.</p> <p>A few minutes later Lucius Zbor gave her a sign of surrender.</p> <p>A collective murmur echoed through the soldiers.</p> <p>The soldiers took their seats, and soon after the soldiers sat, the soldier took his seat.</p> <p>“You,” the soldier said, “are a good leader. Now we will begin our campaign”.</p> <p>The soldiers cheered their approval and anticipation. “I love you,” Lucius Zbor said, taking a deep breath.</p> <p>The soldier’s voice cut through the murmur, “You, too,”. The soldiers all cheered.</p> <p>Lucius started to talk about their war,” you are the first in a campaign to victory this year. Are the others there to watch your brave march, because we have a lot of soldiers who are all yours?</p> <p>“All your soldiers,” the soldier repeated, “everyone is on your side, for all we know,” he finished and they all smiled.</p> <p>The soldiers’ enthusiasm grew. So did their own.</p> <p>“There is one thing everyone wants,” Lucius Zbor whispered.</p> <p>The soldiers all agreed.</p> <p>“One thing that we all wish is that you all get to come and celebrate the new battle here.</p> <p>“One thing,” Lucius Zbor added, “that we all want to do is give you guys a birthday fuck.”</p> <p>With that the soldiers applauded.</p> <p>“Thank you,” the soldier said. “We'll all go to our own barracks tonight...and we could all fuck.”</p> <p>The soldiers all looked at one another. They stared at each other, then they looked at each other. Their eyes were sparkling with excitement.</p> <p>“You want to fuck me,” soldiers asked her.</p> <p>“Come with me, sweet lady,” the soldier with the scarred face said. “I want to fuck you.”</p> <p>The soldiers had her by the arm, so she started walking them to the barracks. After they were inside their barracks and her clothes were off, they took her in their arms and kissed her.</p> <p>The soldiers all took note of her as they were in the barracks. They hugged her.</p> <p>“Let’s go inside,” Lucius Zbor said as he kissed her neck.</p> <p>The soldiers walked into the barracks behind her and the soldier got them inside.</p> <p>Lucius Zbor was wearing a dark silk robe that tied in a knot. The belt ran from his left arm, around to his stomach, and then it parted to his left. It was open as far as the belt, and the buttons were on the front button.</p> <p>The soldier on her left had his arms around her waist, as she hugged him, but was pressed tightly against him. She turned out to the side so the belt caught her left, and as her right, and had her right and pulled.</p> <p>The soldier with the hand could see her to his lips. her. . He did not a soft, while she had his lips and she did not kiss the kiss—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
