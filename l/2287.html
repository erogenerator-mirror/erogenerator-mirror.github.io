It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with</strong> an open back, showing her back and shoulders. When it first occurred to her, though, she smiled seductively and nodded, then looked around the room nervously. Before long, she was getting into the swing of things, her long legs rising and falling, as one of the male figures stepped forward and, without a word, pressed her into the couch. She took it to be her fate. She lay back, waiting, her breasts rising and falling with growing excitement, which she began to pant with excitement, at the thought of what was to follow, and why and with what she herself could do.</p> <p>The first order of things was taking things slow. The other men began first; he undressed, with some success; she removed her dress, revealing a black, silken bra-strap bikini, which she let fall to the floor. From there, she removed her red shawl, allowing it to gather around her back, revealing her shoulders, and the upper curve of her breasts. It was quite obvious, as the male figures approached her, that she wore no panties. The second and third members of the group, though, also stood on the couch, waiting for Zillah's instructions; and so it was that, too, entered the room. Zillah gave them commands: to start fucking Zillah, one at a time, slowly from foot to head. The female figures would go down on Zillah's nipples, then they would suck her clitoris, tongue, and suck a cunt. Zillah's body jerked, and trembled, and she moaned, the sounds like cries of pleasure, as one of the figures, Zillah, went down on her, sucking in her labia. As each step was taken, Zillah's face turned red—a sign that she was in some sort of ecstasy, even though it was a bit of a struggle to find a balance, a way to take her pleasure. The female figures were now making quick work of the male forms. A moment later, a cock was shoved in her mouth and its owner's lips caressed her vulva. She sucked it, at first, then, when Zillah's body began to feel her excitement rising to an heights, she took it out of her mouth and allowed it to thrust in and out of her mouth, fucking her mouth with long stiff strokes of his rigid cock, until, though she may have stopped moving, she felt the sperm ejaculate from Zillah's pussy.</p> <p>The male figures of the group stood, watching the female figures, kissing, caressing, touching, with their hands all over each other's bodies, but Zillah's eyes never quite left them, as she felt the semen being ejaculated by her fellow members, even as she felt the tongue of her mouth suck and lick every drop of cum from their genitals. Only her eyes never came from where she lay naked, naked, face up, with a cock in her mouth, with several of each sex organ in hand, licking their ejaculate from her chin. Every step forward she took with them, was a step forward to a more intense and exciting sexual frenzy of pleasure, to the point where she became lost in it and almost in love with the male members of the group. When a cock came out of her mouth it was not in her mouth. Zillah, though, was taking it all in, as the ejaculate kept coming out, each time, she felt the male bodies, the ones, fucking her mouth, the one in her mouth, the one in her pussy, taking their sperm, all at once from her, in her mouth, in the pussy of the female figure in her face, in her hair, on her breasts, on her stomach, in her vulva, even in her anus. The ejaculation in her body did not stop, but it didn't stop. In one or another second another of the male members who, now, were in her mouth came. As their cumming began, they did a simultaneous blowjob—in one and in the other, of their own hands. Their faces were covered; all they were able to see, though, were their own hands working. They were both orgasming simultaneously; they had a sort of simultaneous orgasm, one that ended in both of their joys, and as they were both cumming simultaneously, they both climaxed with their own hands!</p> <p>Zilah was totally and completely in love with the male members. However, with her own pleasure and on her own terms, she never came. In truth, she climaxed, one orgasm at a time, and, while she was quite conscious of herself, her pleasure was, of course, secondary.</p> <p>like those of sex.
