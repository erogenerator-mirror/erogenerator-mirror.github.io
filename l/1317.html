The Beggar</h4><p><strong>The evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced. On his wife’s</strong> advice, she had given her a copy of her most favorite romance novels. There was always something else to read. In his mind, there would be a book each day or rather today.</p> <p>"And you, my darling." Madame de Ville said.</p> <p>There was still a good number of years before the war and the first period of her period. Today she wore a yellow dress and yellow stockings and brown shoes. Today she had changed her dress—from a long skirt to a pair of black hose and brown shoes. She was already well out of her school uniform, but for his sake she thought it might be a silly thing to wear at school.</p> <p>The evening, there would be a film premiere, because it had already been announced. She had only to wait and see.</p> <p>And, as she was already quite tipsy, she suddenly realized that there was no way she should wait all evening—if she wished to take a cab this late.</p> <p>She quickly stood up, shook out her dress and placed it on the back seat of the waiting cab.</p> <p>The only problem with her dress was its fabric, which only held a button inside.</p> <p>It would be much longer without the buttons. Madame de Ville smiled. She would be the first to show them off.</p> <p>She quickly closed the car door. She hurried to the front door, locked it, and waited for the driver to enter. This was going to be the last moment, since she had already left for school. She was not ready to start her evening with a little wine, but she was ready to get more than that.</p> <p>She quickly opened her door, removed her jacket, and her shoes, and threw them on the back seat. She removed her white knitted sweater, the black top buttons opened, and her black bra.</p> <p>Then she removed her skirt, which she thought would cover anything, but when she opened her legs and stepped out, the material was already wet—too wet, anyway.</p> <p>There was no hurry, just anticipation, and she quickly put her knickers on.</p> <p>Now she opened her dress, lifted her bra up to reveal her bare behind, and put it on. It was already a bit damp, but she felt that she was already getting aroused by the idea.</p> <p>There was a slight adjustment in the seat, but as she sat down to have another drink, the buttons were all the more obvious, the buttons being kept open in the back. The fabric of her dress was now completely wet, and she could already discern the wetness of her breasts through her bra.</p> <p>But there was no stopping her now.</p> <p>The buttons were already undone, but instead of taking the chance to expose them, Madame Ville made the situation worse by trying to undress herself herself.</p> <p>"Ah...Ah...Ah..." The man said. But Madame Ville wanted to show him—in a more sexual fashion. She put her left foot onto the floor, slowly opened her legs, and pushed her right knee downwards. And in the process, her skirt lifted up her thigh to reveal her shins and ankles and also her panty hose.</p> <p>It was even more embarrassing to see her bare ankles being unbuttoned. But she also realized she was getting very horny herself. It was a silly thing to do, but it was very naughty to be thinking of her.</p> <p>She wondered how to make it seem better.</p> <p>She quickly took her own panties off, and put them on, feeling naughty with her own panties in. At last, her skirt was over her hips, it still had buttons open, but now she was sitting with her knees partly pressed together.</p> <p>The excitement of it was making her wet.</p> <p>She had already decided to go home in her own dress, but now, even more shameful to it, she wanted to take her own dress off. She had never done this in her life, even though she could dress herself in her own clothes. She felt even more embarrassed by it than before.</p> <p>"Oh! I am such a slut!" Madame Ville said while looking at herself in the mirror over her dress.</p> <p>She removed it to expose the most intimate part of her body. She removed the clothes and put them in her purse. She put her panty hose back on, took the bra off, and put it on.</p> <p>She took all her clothes off, and put them in her purse.</p> <p>In the end, she only had to wait for the taxi. . She was sure that she had just to go home very late. The taxi now. no one last one last minute, but, even.</p> <p>a little bit of her dress left. She had been there in her clothes. to save the final to go home. It for one last a little. Her very little night, to wear the taxi.
