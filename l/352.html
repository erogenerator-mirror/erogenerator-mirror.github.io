It was a cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer</strong> he got there, the more it seemed like every single car sat empty. He saw as he neared the car. “Fuck.”</p> <p>“I don’t know what time they’re actually getting on the bus to London, but can you please please tell me when they are coming back to the States.” “I can’t” “I think I heard a lot of people saying that yesterday’s your birthday but can’t be true.” “They’re supposed to be coming back.” “What do you mean? Can’t be true." They stared at each other in disbelief. “Can’t be true.” “I think we should just leave them all alone so they can’t hear us.” “The hell we should go. We’ll never speak of them again.” “They’re just the way that we live.” Rebecca and Rebecca walked closer to each other. They approached each other’s shoulders, each holding the other’s hand. “I love you so much” “I love you to” “Just don’t let them hear us” Rebecca squeezed Rebecca’s hand.  I hate you.</p> <p>Yes! But I love you to, and you” Rebecca said kissing Rebecca’s cheek. “I’m just as much to love you as you are to love me”  I love you too”  Yeah!   They got to Rebecca’s bed and undressed. They kissed passionately, Rebecca rubbing her hand on Rebecca’s shoulder, Rebecca leaning to the wall and kissing Rebecca passionately. They undressed each other’s clothes and then continued kissing. Rebecca’s breast hung above Rebecca’s belly button. Rebecca’s pussy was neatly trimmed. Rebecca’s pussy hair was very sparse. They both had a lot of hair on their bodies. Rebecca’s pussy was shaved bald and Rebecca’s pussy had no hair. Rebecca’s pussy mound felt nice. Rebecca slid her fingers under the bottom of Rebecca’s breast. Rebecca’s breast felt nice and Rebecca gently squeezed the breast.  Yeah! She thought. When their mouths finally came off Rebecca’s she was gasping.  So you wanted sex too.  Rebecca reached back and stroked her nipples. She loved pinching them. She could feel that they were almost swollen with desire, and they felt longer than her nipples. She could also feel her pussy getting wetter. Rebecca leaned back against the wall with her hands on her thighs. Rebecca’s fingers continued the movement of her nipples with her left hand.  So now that we’ve gotten all that we’ve got we can continue on  Rebecca’s hand moved further down her belly.  And you can do it too, she thought. Rebecca reached behind her and felt her pussy. She gasped as she felt Rebecca’s finger slide down her wet lips.  Yes! That’s perfect” she said. Rebecca pulled her finger away from her pussy and traced her fingers round her pussy lips. She could feel her wetness, and Rebecca slowly brought her finger to her mouth. Rebecca stuck her finger into her mouth. Her mouth was warm and wet; her tongue seemed to just keep licking that finger. As she moved the finger around in her mouth her finger touched another finger on the other finger. She brought her finger to her mouth and opened her lips and touched it to Rebecca’s lips. Rebecca kissed Rebecca’s finger. It felt warm and wet. Rebecca ran her tongue around Rebecca’s finger.  But now for me, she said. Rebecca bent down and kissed Rebecca’s left nipple and gently took her breast in her mouth and sucked. Rebecca could feel the warmth of Rebecca’s mouth on her breast. Rebecca felt like a cat in heat. When Rebecca’s breasts and nipples were nice and hard Rebecca continued to kiss her while she felt Rebecca’s breasts and nipples rub against her own.  Now, what I want to do, Rebecca said.</p> <p>They looked at each other and I want to do.</p> <p><|> “Please do” Rebecca said Rebecca.</p> <p>, “You know that” Rebecca said Rebecca. it We just   it . <| don  you n”.
