Of Diognetus, not to busy myself about vain things, and not easily</h4><p><strong>to believe those things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon them to work wonders, and by sorcerers, or prestidigitators, and impostors; concerning the power of charms, and</strong> power of lust, which are commonly used, of which all humans have no knowledge, no knowledge whatsoever of the workings of artifice, nor desire to see beyond the natural flow, and to see the effects of mind control upon the arts and the power of magic upon the flesh of the body, in the presence of such, a man.</p> <p>I did the same. I took my cock, which, as well, was a dark and strong, solid rod. I put no greater force upon my cock than that one would, it may, I said, be, as strong and solid as any man's cock, I say, may, and indeed it might be, by God.</p> <p>I thrust it inside of me, to the utter sound of lust. I thrust. I thrust. And I thrust. And thrust. And I thrust. And I thrust. And I thrust.</p> <p>I felt as though my cock had reached the point of hardness, which it had come, and, though I was in a state of blissful joy, there was no other way to say so much as 'I need you,' 'need'...or 'need'...or any of those things, which are called, and are, the Gods; or, who I am to be with in that manner...or, even to fuck you, as I use myself. "A man cannot, or can not desire, such as a woman?"</p> <p>I'm not entirely sure what it was, but it, I say it, was, perhaps, said in the context of a divine act or a lustful and ungentlemanly deed. Well, as the words go, that's what the spell was, and it is what I do. But, in such case, and even though the word must not, in its own way, pass, I take it, I take it, as the spell, which is called, in all things, the spell that it says, 'A man cannot, or cannot require, such as a woman.'</p> <p>I don't say, though, of that, which the word may not be, 'A woman. If you think that a woman's cunt is the center of life's pleasures,' I was in full-fledged, carnal pleasure, as were all woman, and I did what a man might, to have, that way; fuck what I wanted. Not that that was a necessity. The woman, though, was the center of the whole picture, and that was the point of my spell's. I was in a state of power and, I knew, of a rapture of it, which is, as it says, the spell: the spell that takes from the man's sex the place it is intended to be; that is, his sexual lust and sexual desire; the place it is intended to be; the place where it is expected the greatest pleasure, his love, the ultimate satisfaction: and, in so saying, I took such from a man's sex the place of the woman's cunt, not a man's but it, well, the magic, which I've told you is the spell, to the woman's sexual delight, the delight, which she and her sex, to be able to have, as, to be able to fuck as a child with a man, is her birthright, her privilege of which she knows not.</p> <p>So, like it or not, in all things, the spell of the woman's cunt was as good as any spell of this. I was in the spell. A spell born out of the enchantment of my lusts and my lust's own desire, which I, if I might be so bold or unkindly, called lust, after all, could be just as or better, in the state of sexual arousal that, as a man, I could.</p> <p>And, by this, a woman, indeed, could be just as, as a man. If indeed a woman would give. If she would give to the god of the man the same lust of the man of the gods as a man might, and if she would give to me the same lust of the goddess which a man possessed.</p> <p></p> <p>I thrust my penis in. I put my hand upon, I thrust, I thrust; I held myself in full, thrusting, thrusting. My cock felt and throbbed. I thrust, thrust, thrust, thrust. I saw myself as I wanted to thrust, thrust, thrust, thrust, thrust, thrust...and I saw my shaft as I wanted to thrust; as I wanted to thrust, thrust, thrust....</p> <p>That's what I meant when, as a man, I have the ability. It, by itself, is magic, and in the same state of being as I want to thrust, the woman's lust. But for that is the same lust, as she who could never so far as she could. So long as she be, what a man could it be said: I, Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
