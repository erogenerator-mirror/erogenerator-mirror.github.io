The Guests</h4><p><strong>In the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to</strong> celebrate the holiday.</p> <p>He took off his spectacles and put his glasses on and I asked his permission to look at the dress I had provided for him to wear. It had opened in front of him and I had slipped it over his shoulders in a very sexy, dark plum-coloured blouse, with the white collar of his white shirt. For the top button had been cut at the front. The top of the slit on the side of his neck was black and satin like a very fashionable, white one of those scarlet button-front blouses. The neck had one or two horizontal red lines across the collar and under it as the neck fitted comfortably. He had no buttons to hide what was underneath and I could see why.</p> <p>In the left corner of his neck, there were red stripes, matching the white of the collar, and it was tucked into, and then the top of the slit had some red silk and blue lace on it from which to go. The slit was opened just below the collar and had matching white ribbon bow. The ribbon had been carefully tied behind the neck to hold his collar closed, to which he had been able to put his hands at his sides, at least, when he would be looking down at his neck.</p> <p>I had already decided to make the dress sexy. I had not worn it for the holidays, so it was a perfect choice. I had been looking very carefully to make sure I would not draw any unwanted attention of anyone else present, though there was a part which I was sure of my success to this point.</p> <p>His eyes shone with delight and I said, laughing and clapping my hands with joy, "You look so sexy!"</p> <p>I was delighted too, for the dress was a very unusual, very elegant and very expensive one. It fitted his neck snugly and would hug him tightly, with a large strap at the front. Its neck, like the dress, was made of a solid material and, unlike his neck, it was not a material which would be transparent or transparent at all. The material fitted his shoulders beautifully, although it was almost transparent around his neck. It had a very smooth silk waistband with a small embroidered line.</p> <p>After I had seen it many times in the store I had taken it to my home office and, with the help of something on the side table, had placed it on his lower chest. I had already decided to use the tie of the collar just below the collar and tie it just beneath his neck too. His neck and necktie were both of equal value and could be worn with just the right amount of time. I had not done so and had not worn it for many years. But for a long time I had, and it had already been on for some reason. Now it could be worn, and a lot of other things could be worn if we wanted it. A man's necktie could be just barely held up with one of its strings and could easily be pulled loose at all times, a man's necktie could be pulled loose with just his hands. The necktie itself was a very comfortable-looking, smooth silk, and its neck tie was a very sexy, sexy and extremely elegant material, with a very interesting feel. It was a very expensive and expensively expensive one and I knew it would get the highest prices that I could. A simple silk scarf could be used to tie it around his left collarbone to ensure it was completely fastened. The scarf itself could be fastened to the front of the collar, around his neck, which held his neck completely still. The scarf was very smooth. It was silk, which is a delicate silk, and it was very easy to wear. I had not tried the scarf in the shop or even worn it with it, but in the store I knew it was a very expensive and expensive silk scarf. It had made me very eager when the shop was open for an hour or so, a very expensive scarf like that, and I could hardly wait to get it.</p> <p>He had a lot of work to do in a hurry, but I was very pleased as I knew everything his whole body was going to be busy. The skirt that I had brought with me looked very classy with the high-heeled shoes, although they were very high heels that would be fun on him, if he didn't know he was standing in front of a street full of people and wearing a high-heeled, high-heeled shoe. The stockings were very sexy and would look very nice on him, even if he wasn't wearing them. On the white shirt which was a very expensive and expensive piece of white silk, he would be so proud to see that. My white, because, that the top was the highest quality he would be a simple silk scarf and because he was a very comfortable with the scarf, a very rich, and the high heels. However, his blouse, for how long necktie, and beautifulâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
