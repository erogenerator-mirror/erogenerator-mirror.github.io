I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I</strong> put it all neatly.</p> <p>After setting it all ready, I turned to her in the gloom, and she noticed where it was I was looking. "It's me," she laughed, "you're not the only one who's taken on that same feeling."</p> <p>"But I'm naked!" I protested, "We're in the garden. And I'm having a glass of wine."</p> <p>"No way," She pouted, "You're too cute topless and the only thing we're in here is wine."</p> <p>I looked down to where my penis was pointing to the cold night air. It was rock hard. Without thinking about it, I stood up. I was still holding my wineglass in my right hand, and I raised the glass up to her lips and slowly put it between her lips. She took it and held it, and she licked it.</p> <p>"Is it all that tasty fresh semen from your last ejaculation?" I couldn't deny that. And she was just as delicious tasting as I remembered. She didn't waste any time at least. She got down between my legs, her face right in front of my penis. And, as she licked my penis from its base to the tip, she looked up to my face and smiled.</p> <p>"I guess we are going to have to come back here, when we've finished and you've gone." She said in her most innocent expression. Still holding my penis in her hands, she put the wineglass down on the dresser, turned around, and knelt down beside me. She pulled the hem of my trousers up over my buttocks. I put the remains of my clothes on the dresser.</p> <p>She lifted my penis up to her lips. I watched her as she put it into her mouth, and she sucked on it. She looked at me, and saw the look on my face.</p> <p>"You seem so nervous." She said between slurps of my penis, "I was worried. I mean."</p> <p>"I'm not worried, I just want to be with you." But she wasn't having much of it. She had stopped for a second, and I saw her tongue, as she ran it around the crown of my swollen dick. "I'm trying to make you feel as safe and relaxed as possible." She started licking the shaft of my penis once more, as if she was worshipping it through her own tongue. Then she licked me even deeper into her mouth. As she licked up and down, she took the head into her lips, and she sucked and licked every inch, and I felt that, all the way up to the tip of my penis, as if I was in a dream world, where it was impossible to imagine anything with all its own reality. It felt so nice, like a long journey, when I felt the warm pressure of her lips, or her tongue, on my cock-head. I could feel and taste her saliva as it dribbled along the length of my penis. I could hardly feel her tongue on the shaft. How I had imagined this, when we had been kissing each other all this time. But it really felt too good. It felt as if she was tasting the very life-force of my body. I'd had that dream of her standing over me when she, or myself, or whoever we were in the dark. But now, with her face up close to my penis-head; her lips right at the very top of it; and her hand gripping my thigh, she was really my first. The only reason or even the right reason was because she just had to touch me!</p> <p>It seemed so good. It was so very good! I couldn't stop myself from moving my hips. I could feel things beginning to happen. Suddenly, I found myself saying, "Mum, I want you to go on, but please, mum... please, let me come - please..."</p> <p>"Mmmhmm." Was all she murmured.</p> <p>"It will be so good." I said in a quiet, almost breathless voice, "If that's what you really want."</p> <p>"I want you in me!" she said, as she released me from her mouth, and brought her head to my chest. I didn't even have to say another word, because she was already down on her knees, again.</p> <p>And she was all the way down on me. I felt her lips and tongue all over my cock, with its glans. Her hands were still gripping my thigh. Her tongue ran up and down my shaft, and as she stroked it, her hands caressed my testicles from the base to the tip. It's tip, in her fingers. My hands cupped her breasts. Her hair, caressing the sides as they explored her, gently moved her thighs in the backs of her legs. They touched each, I felt her.
