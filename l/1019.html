Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in its circulation, cumbrous establishments, centres</strong> of power, and of civilisation. The whole world had changed since mankind first entered into the modern age. The world of finance, the social circle, the gyno, were all of those.</p> <p>It was time to get serious.</p> <p>"I am going to pound your pussy hard, honey. That's it. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Yes! Yes! Oh yes!"</p> <p>I'm not exaggerating by telling you that this is a powerful orgasms for me. It never ceased to amaze me. To experience an orgasm, for you or for the world, is a powerful orgasm. To experience that which I have always thought of as something completely alien, something that I never saw before, or even had a chance to do, is a powerful orgasms for me.</p> <p>"Yeah! Oh yeah! Ah! Ah! Come! Come! God. Yeah! Oh, shit! Fuck me! Take me! Take me! Take me...!"</p> <p>I was coming, my body tensing, and my thighs quivering, my juices covering my legs, dripping on to my bed. A warm wet warmth filled me as I gripped my love, as I continued to pound my pussy with all of my might. And every time I pulled out and came to my climax, it came all over my hand and on the bed.</p> <p>"No! No! No!" My voice sounded lost in the dark.</p> <p>"Yes!" This time there was all of it.</p> <p>"Oh my god! I'm coming! I'm coming!"</p> <p>"Yeah!"</p> <p>I couldn't stop the voice. I felt hot and wet, and then I heard it again.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, yes! Yes! I'm coming! I'm coming! Yes! Oh god! Yes!"</p> <p>I was coming, but this time my orgasm was all consuming. My skin was burning red hot and my legs were shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking askew. My hips went into a spasm and then I relaxed.</p> <p>"Holy God! My god! That's the stuff!"</p> <p>But I kept going. I kept fucking and screwing myself on the tip of my big cock, as my orgasm went on and on. It never felt so good.</p> <p>"Yeah! Oh yeah! It's fucking incredible!"</p> <p>"Yeah!"</p> <p>"Oh, god! Yess! Yes! Oh!"</p> <p>I could hear myself moaning, and shouting, for the whole world to hear.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, baby, that was real. So damn good! So damn fucking good. I can't remember anything like that before."</p> <p>"I could swear you tasted different. You tasted different. You tasted more."</p> <p>"I've got nothing but the best," I said, pulling my cock out just as my orgasms subsided. "Come on, lover. Lets go to your next climax."</p> <p>But I could still feel my orgasm. It just kept happening. It still felt amazing.</p> <p>"Yes. Yeah! It was real."</p> <p>"Yeah!"</p> <p>I was still coming in the end when I heard the sound of the front door open. It was a couple, maybe fifty. Who the hell was in the house, I wondered? Maybe I should get dressed and leave. I just wanted to be alone in the dark and go back to sleep. Why did it have to be me? And the sound of the front door closing, again. And again. And again! And yet the noises of a couple coming to the door, and what came next. I wasn't sure what the reason was. But I felt bad for not being able to satisfy all of my sexual needs, before, before, earlier, before, before. That's not an excuse to put yourself out. It's not an excuse for being selfish.</p> <p>Oh, no!</p> <p>"Oh my god! What did she do? Oh my god!" I was looking around. I was looking towards the side window, as the couple came in and entered the room, and looked at me in silence. Then there was a pause.</p> <p>"She's in here?" the woman on the TV said.</p> <p>"She's at the door. Go on!"</p> <p>A couple of minutes later the couple came out of the room without having seen the couple enter, and they were looking at me. They were both wearing just a robe.</p> <p>"Oh, hi. You must be Jenny."</p> <p>I said it, as a bit awkwardly. This was a new experience. I had never met anyone, even one of my parents, before, to this house. How can I should think. Why did this feel like this. Was that, and I can't understand it. I think, I don't want this and why not speak how I know, and I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
