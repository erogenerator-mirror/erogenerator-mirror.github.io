Nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets should be omitted. Whatever may have been the singular</strong> event which was the greatest sex event of the century, there was something uniquely distinctive about it. No matter the fact that the sex event had been celebrated for centuries, most of the sexual acts were only a minor part of life after the end of time. The sex act was something that happened whenever the mood struck us. We don't want to waste such a valuable event in the wrong era.</p> <p>But the sex itself was in the forefront of my thoughts of many years ago. A certain certain special person came to my mind of such a moment. And it happened in the early hours of the morning, when I was walking through the streets of London in an open coat collar and an open hat. I was in the presence of the person from whom a particular young man was in the midst of pleasuring himself. He had a hard cock which he was working hard to bring to full hardness. I wanted him to cum himself. It was important for him that the pleasure of those sensations be felt by him.</p> <p>"The pleasure of such a beautiful sight," I murmured, walking towards him to gaze upon his hard cock. "May soon I have some of these too."</p> <p>He didn't answer, instead allowing his hand to trail down to his cock and begin to stroke it. He smiled at me, perhaps enjoying the experience of the moment; although it was the first time we had ever been alone. It might be, perhaps was more than just the sex itself, however. The sex act itself was something special between us and it was certainly a rare occasion. We just weren't ready to consummate that mutual acquaintance yet.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," I complimented him, and walked towards him. I was still smiling when I reached him. I knelt on an end of the pavement, bent over slightly, reaching out with my hands to caress his broad shoulders and work his biceps. With my hands on his shoulders and my hands on his broad back, his arms went around my waist as I held him close to my mouth. Our lips pressed together gently as his tongue was exploring my mouth. I could taste myself on his tongue.</p> <p>"May I...," he began.</p> <p>I stood up straight, my face only a touch apart from his. My fingers on his arms to lead him away from me made our kiss deeper than it was possible to be in the company of such a single person. I did have an amazing lover, but I was going to make him mine. For him I wanted to make him mine. For us he was mine.</p> <p>"The pleasure it is to be alone like this, always alone." I kissed the corner of his mouth, his nose, and both of his cheeks. "Always with you."</p> <p>"Oh, and by the way," I said as I bent down over his shoulder to kiss his neck. "Your cock is definitely a special delight and one which will be hard to forget this week."</p> <p>His tongue began to dance with mine, tracing lazy circles around it, teasing just the tip of it with some sort of preformed response. It was my pleasure too, but I'm sure I didn't deserve such a special treat. But we enjoyed the moment. I knew that we would eventually meet after the night was over. But I had no intention of letting myself be left with such a special occasion.</p> <p>"Let's go," I heard him say. A few seconds later, we were walking through the streets of London together. At least there was an equal amount of sexual tension between us as there was now. This time we were together with his friend's family.</p> <p>"So we shall...," I prompted him. I was sure that our meeting had been planned to begin by making passionate sex for the first time. Perhaps it wasn't a good idea to put a sexual dimension to the sex we had already started. But I wasn't really expecting some kind of romantic encounter that might be a good idea this second time either. Especially while we were holding hands like a couple.</p> <p>"It will be very memorable," he said after kissing my forehead. We continued walking as he continued to caress my arm and the side of my face with his hands. "The best sex for ages as well as forever, I have to say."</p> <p>"Yes!" I said, kissing him, making him smile and take another step. We held hands, exchanging looks. His eyes held mine while his hands stroked my arm all the way around to the middle of my back. He took a step towards a street, away from the pedestrian area towards a small building where we weren't even really going to the moment of momentous penetration, but just holding hands. He looked into my eyes as his hand continued its ascent towards my shoulder and arm. "Yes," he said: "it "It was "A beautiful."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The time had just that first time when it arrived.</p> <p></p> <p>I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
