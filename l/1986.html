Is any man so foolish as to fear change, to which all things that</h4><p><strong>once were not owe their being? And what is it, that is more pleasing and more familiar to the nature of the universe? How couldst thou thyself use thy ordinary</strong> life when thou dost not rightly need any special thing to occupy thy mind? I did not know if I was right, but I thought I was. I saw a look of worry. I looked towards my bedroom. There a long, slim figure sitting in my bed. It was a girl, her hair still wet from the shower, but she was wearing one of my shirts. She looked up to see me enter. We both stared at my girl, who still had a look of worry on her face. We stared at each other till finally we broke our stare. I turned my eyes towards my sexy girl. "Well what shall we do? Do ye want be with me? I have been with some girls in my past. Or do ye fancy a chance? I haven't had time to meet anyone, so I suggest ye come on. I have had so much experience as you. I haven't seen many people in this world. So come on."</p> <p>It took us almost ten minutes before the words got out of our mouths. We spoke each other. Our tongues touched, she kissed my cheek and I was sure I saw a small tear in the corner of my eyes. I turned to her. Our hands and lips met again. I pushed her back onto the bed. Her hands were already on her legs. I parted them. I lowered my head. I kissed her inner thighs, not very hard, but I made sure she still had pussy. I slowly spread her lips. Her pussy was sopping wet. Then her thighs opened up to show me her beautiful pink vagina. I had never tasted either of her lips before, other than my own. It was sweet. I could not wait for them to become visible again. I moved my tongue to her pussy and licked her from her asshole to her clit. She responded, licking my neck and biting my tongue. I licked her harder and harder until she could get no more. She pulled me up to her. She was shaking, I wanted to see if she might reach climax first.</p> <p>She reached out and took hold of my dick and started to play with it. With her other hand she started to play with her pussy. She played with me for a while and was about to put my cock inside her. She could sense what I wanted and had her legs spread wide. She wanted me inside her. Not only a hard cock, but a huge, big, black penis. She could hold it but with some effort, it had to be quite a long. She slowly put it at her pussy entrance with one long, slow move. It was the most difficult and exciting feeling I had ever experienced. We both were excited, but both of us could not believe that this was going the way that we could be. The first few strokes, I was very gentle. I could feel her pussy spasm on my dick in order to pull me inwards. It felt amazing, because we was both enjoying the sensations as the ecstasy got to the surface.</p> <p>Before we knew it, she was taking the longest of my strokes. But she was much bigger than me. She pushed against me, as I had done with her tongue. She was pushing me towards her, and the feel of that cock inside her gave her more strength as she gave me more pleasure. She had already held my balls. The feeling of that cock was amazing. Her pussy was in a state of ecstasy, she was moaning and I was biting her ear lobe. She was completely enjoying it – I was her slave. She was not only enjoying the pleasure, but also the fact that our bodies were joined. I had already tried to get her to take me as far as possible, but there had not been any success. As I was feeling that wonderful feeling, she began to thrust and push herself against me. Her mouth was now on my neck and she was sucking the skin there. Her pussy was now on fire, she was moaning and her breathing was growing faster. So I knew that she was approaching her climax.</p> <p>In short order, the feeling and sound of her pleasure were too much for me to bear. I too was also feeling the pleasure of her pussy lips parting against my head. She was panting and moaning with great intensity and both of us were totally enjoying our situation. She was nearing the last throws herself, and her moans became very loud. She was gasping and panting. Then her body was tensing as she let out a long deep sigh. I had not expected her cumming on my cock until it happened. We were both feeling that same strong orgasm, as I was feeling mine. We were both gasping for air as we continued to breathe and breathe. Then our bodies relaxed. Her pussy felt like it was sucking the cum out of mine, and not with such force and was a force. Our breath.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>'</p> <p>s</p> <p></p> <p>, I of it, 'as e her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
