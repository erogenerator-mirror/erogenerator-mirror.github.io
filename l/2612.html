His Power cannot, without his consent, be Transferred to another: He cannot Forfeit it: He cannot be Accused</strong>: And for the purpose of the Consequences and Consequences, he must be born anew.</p> <p>And so he did. He fucked with her as long as he could, when the consequences were bad and she was scared beyond belief. Eventually, once more, her breasts were bare, her body writhing beneath him. He fucked her there, while she was on the edge of her fourth orgasm - the one before the sex itself began.</p> <p>*</p> <p>That night. The next night, when his seed was in her belly, when her tongue probed his anus, his seed was in her vagina, and they were both still, breathless, the night in a dream.</p> <p>***</p> <p>She woke up at eight AM to the smell of coffee and bacon cooking in the bathroom. She opened the French doors to the large shower and let it, hot and running, flow and splash over her as she stepped out. Her nipples ached and throbbed. She'd gone too long without sex.</p> <p>She looked at herself in the mirror, in the tiny bar in front of her.</p> <p>She'd had a hard time deciding if what she'd done was right or not - her past-her-times had been a waste. But she just knew, she had let another man take over and had made her own decisions.</p> <p>As soon as she'd left the restroom and closed the door, she had turned around and pulled off her own clothes. "I'd better get some work done, before I take my mind off things," she thought.</p> <p>She shaved her legs, and when she came in from the kitchen, the sight of her legs was enough. She wore a skirt that buttoned right above her hip, an old, thin blouse, tied with a string, and a bra that barely covered her breasts. The blouse didn't show her panties (which weren't much in the bra department) but the blouse was very full, the buttons of her blouse pulled together so her breasts were visible and her nipples visible - very visible. Not to mention, the skirt.</p> <p>She was wearing some very heavy, see-through panties, with a very short, black skirt, but not any panties at all.</p> <p>She saw, "What the hell?"</p> <p>"I was thinking, I can't wear those!"</p> <p>"Are you kidding me? You're a gorgeous woman and I've had some great sex."</p> <p>She grinned, she'd loved hearing his voice, "It was only sex, but I still got off," She reached under her skirt and pulled her panties aside, "you need to stop, it's all wet."</p> <p>She felt herself flushed again.</p> <p>"Hm. Yeah, I bet, "he'd left her in the bathroom to brush her teeth, "or at least brush my teeth while I was washing my teeth," He always kept himself off hers. His fingers still in her, working. She'd never noticed the way he looked at her. Always, she was lost in pleasure, and she always found herself wanting for more.</p> <p>Still the man, she'd wanted his fingers in her in a long time. Just for that one moment.</p> <p>When her teeth were squeaky clean, he was standing in the bathroom drying his hands. She saw her skirt raise when he moved closer.</p> <p>"Sorry," he said.</p> <p>"It's ok," she felt her face grow hot, "I'm not trying to be coy," she'd said, to the man's surprise.</p> <p>He looked at her, "Yes, you're, you're not shy or embarrassed?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not," She looked at the mirror. When she opened her eyes again, he was dressed, but she couldn't tell if he was looking at her naked breast, or her skirt. Her eyes went back to his body, "It's, um, its only the heat from you."</p> <p>"Hm." She saw something flicker between him and her that made her freeze. It couldn't have been the clothes? "You're beautiful." "Thanks."</p> <p>"You're not shy about it?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Well," she looked him in the eye, "the hot water makes me so hot, I can feel your..." she shook her head, trying to think about what the subject was. "I don't think we'll last much longer."</p> <p>He looked at her with unspoken interest. She'd never noticed this kind of expression before. His body was muscular and tight, yet he looked like he had a very long fuse, "I'm a very hot man, too."</p> <p>With no other than those two other men, when aroused, not, but she didn't think he had two, "You have the perfect breasts?"</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes, and a man?"
