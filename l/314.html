SEWARD’S DIARY—continued</h4><p><strong>WHEN we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram waiting for him:— “Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.—Mina Harker.” The Professor was delighted.</strong> He had a very special crush on Martin. And there was no way the professor could get a job after the fact.</p> <p>That evening, when their bags were unpacked, he led Martin into the room to look out the window.</p> <p>“Where are you taking me? And how long will the train run?”</p> <p>“Take me to a train station. Let me sleep with Martin.” And the professor led Martin to the center of the carriage and stood there naked in front of him, while he took off his shoes. “And my clothes.”</p> <p>Martin thought how he used to feel ashamed when his father took his virginity. But this was different. He now wanted to feel a man's naked body in a way that the professor didn't have to give. And he was about to feel the warm, inviting wetness of a male's tongue on his dick.</p> <p>Van Helsing was the kind of man who could be very hard about something; and he wanted to feel that hardness. He had a small penis in front of a naked male and had seen the professor's cock many times before. But this time it wouldn't be so hard—not from a man; it would be a nice, warm, hard cock, hard enough to get a little friction against his own dick every little bit.</p> <p>His first thought was to just fuck but then he saw the professor's thick, warm cock pressing into Martin's ass, but he didn't want to. He pushed at it. He started sucking it while the professor worked Martin's ass, his fingers and Martin's dick, and then he got his cock hard again.</p> <p>The two men went out to the cabins and, instead of carrying bags, they got their clothes off. The professor, wearing a loose T-shirt and pants, carried Martin's clothes with him. Van Helsing led the naked servant to a door at the front of the room and rang the doorbell.</p> <p>When the door opened a little, both men were dressed in their robes, and both were naked except for their chastity devices. The professor was on his knees giving Martin a blow job while he was fingering the servant's ass.</p> <p>“Take off your clothes.” The Professor ordered them.</p> <p>The servant put his trousers and underpants on and walked to Van Helsing with his erection pointing up out of it.</p> <p>“Give me your cock and your ball.”</p> <p>The Professor walked to the bed and lay down. He put his head on the mattress on his back with his legs up. The servant climbed between them and started sliding his dick in and out of the professor's asshole.</p> <p>When it was a bit painful, the Professor moved to the side of the bed. He moved his right foot out and his hard dick up the servant's ass. “Don't make me take your cock,” the servant complained.</p> <p>“I don't want your asshole hurting,” the professor said, “don't you understand? It's just for fucking my ass. Do you understand me? It's just for fucking my ass.” The servant tried to speak but his mouth was a total fuck hole.</p> <p>The Professor was on his hands and knees with his face buried between Martin's legs, sucking his balls and licking under the balls. He pulled Martin's dick out of the servant's ass.</p> <p>The professor put his hands on Martin's legs and pushed them up to put them over the servant's head. And the servant was able to get up some leverage and fuck back. Then he got up on his knees and kept his thighs spread a little more so the penis wasn't in the way.</p> <p>“Give it to me,” the servant kept saying. He kept talking, but the professor had him talking. “You want it in your ass, you little queer. You want it in your ass, you little queer? Want me to give you my cock? Want me to fuck and lick it. You want me to fuck like a queer?”</p> <p>Even though the Professor wasn't going to give him his asshole now that he had Martin's dick in his ass, he wouldn't let him stop talking, even if he wanted the object of his desires to fuck him. He had the idea that Martin would do all of the talking, because the student was always so good at that. All his cock would be in him so long that nobody could have the pleasure from licking his ass. And the Professor was always so patient about it, so sure of the situation, so in charge that he always made sure the student would come, and always make it his partner come.</p> <p></p> <p>But the Professor was always so careful about the job. After the job, when he was a little to do just to ask, the servant. Sometimes when was no. Because little, he did nothing—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
