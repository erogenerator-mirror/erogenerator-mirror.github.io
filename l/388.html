His eyes ran rapidly over the wide space,</strong> wondering what other objects that he could use it for but he had no idea. Suddenly all of the things he had seen in high school ran wild again and he was sure he would never come back. Just when his mind was on the subject, a blast of blue smoke blasted high above him, striking him in the left eye. He looked up and he realized that he was awake, aching for a nap. It was a long night. He lay there for what felt like an hour thinking about the way things went on this day, wondering if it would ever happen again, wondering what other objects he might use them on. Suddenly, he heard the familiar sound of a door slamming and he knew that he was getting to bed early. "I'm gonna get that pipe right now". He thought as he took a shower and laid out his usual sleeping attire. He took the pipe to the door and walked in and was greeted with a quick smile. He walked up behind her and grabbed her hand, stopping her at the foot of the bed. They stood there, holding each other's hands, looking each other over. "I'm sorry to be such a bore". "It's all a bunch of nerves, my girl", he said.</p> <p>Her words hit him like a ton of bricks. "You are too beautiful to be embarrassed."</p> <p>"Don't be," he said, grabbing her by the arm and pulling her up and over the desk. He carried her back down the hall and stopped at her door. For a brief second, they stared straight into each other's eyes. "I would love to make love to you". "But we must get back to your room and finish the pipe I dropped."</p> <p>A chill went through him. There was no going back now. He walked back to his desk and sat down in front of the papers and started to type. He stared into his hands for one last second before he typed the email that he had sent to his boss so many months ago, and then wrote his name, his last name, along with his office address and phone number. His phone rang once he had typed her name. He didn't respond to the incoming call because if he did, he deleted all of his contact information including all his calls, since he never called when he was in town. She had called his last name once, almost as a joke, so maybe she just did it in a joke. He didn't even know her number, but he still had his office key.</p> <p>He got up from his desks desk and walked to the front door, his eyes scanning the hallway, searching for her. "I have a surprise for you, my girl".</p> <p>Her lips moved towards his, a hint of urgency in her look. He stepped back then, letting his eyes roam over her. The last thing in his mind was that she could really be his girlfriend. She was the sexiest girl in the world. He took off his clothes slowly, savoring their softness, smelling their fragrance. He couldn't believe that she could have been the one to drop this. He took his cock in his hand and it seemed like forever before the head found her skin and she moaned his name. He walked back to her and sat down, pulling her on top of him. She could feel his hardness against her pussy. "I can't believe I am going to fuck you right now, my girl." He groaned, kissing her neck, her shoulders, her upper arms. He moved one arm up and cupped her breast, finding her nipple. "Do you like it?"</p> <p>She shook her head yes, moving his head from her neck to her waiting lips, kissing her deeply. Their tongues wrestled, battling each other and her hands started to move over his body. They pulled his shirt over his head, leaving him wearing only his jeans. She undid his pants, tearing them off as he helped her get them off. She ran her fingers along the outline of his cock and it throbbed in her hand. He moaned as her tongue touched his, licking around his lips. She reached down to squeeze his cock, gently pulling on the tip. His member throbbed in her grasp, pulsing before her eyes. "I want you in me", She whispered into his lips.</p> <p>He moved her on his cock, shoving it into her and thrusting wildly. She cried out, her arms moving underneath him, her tits rising and falling in time with his thrust. Their bodies slammed into each other, sweat dripped down both bodies, their skin sliding against each other's. Her breath came in gasps, her legs shook and shook. He bent down, kissing down her throat, her breasts, her belly, her stomach, and kissed her stomach and she pulled him and her legs. She was panting her stomach and shaking his head, her mouth, moaning into his body all over and licking and rubbing her.
