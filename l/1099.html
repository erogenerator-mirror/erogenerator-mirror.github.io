He turned to her by reflex.</p> <p>"Oh you...!" Marius exclaimed in delight.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, sir," she said with a cheeky grin on her face while gazing him up and down seductively. "Oh! I... I thought we... I mean..." he stammered. "Ohhh!!!"</p> <p>Marius couldn't be more pleased! He had a raging erection. But he didn't look at the older girl. He looked at her gorgeous, long-fingered, and glistening face which she lovingly offered up to him. Marius stared at her, his erection throbbing in his pants, his entire body a jolt of excitement. He couldn't move anymore. It was so wrong! He was going to lose his virginity tonight!</p> <p>Marius' excitement increased by the seconds. Marius began to move forwards on the steps. He had to find out what he wanted from Marius. He wanted a chance to actually get to fuck this girl's brains out, not just her gorgeous face. He wanted to feel those beautiful sexy lips on his cock. He wanted her hands on his body. He didn't want Marius to end up on a street corner being propositioned by some perverted beggar or a prostitute.</p> <p>He couldn't take it anymore. He didn't care anymore. Marius' face was flushed with excitement and lust.</p> <p>Marius stopped and looked at her with a grin, "But, I'm afraid... I must... uh... you'll..." he said, suddenly remembering. He looked down at his bulging crotch and felt his penis twitch.</p> <p>Marius thought to himself, "I must be a pervert!" However, she didn't seem to notice any of that. "Please!" Marius repeated desperately.</p> <p>"You... you must be a pervert," Marius murmured as he stood up and quickly put his hands against the sides of the stairs for support. "I'm sorry that I am so... clumsy... for some of this stuff," he apologized.</p> <p>"I'm not like them," Marius reassured him.</p> <p>"I'll be... you don't..." Marius looked down at his bulging bulge to see if he was too embarrassed about his size. His erection had gone beyond a little embarrassed. He looked back up at her. "We don't have to have sex, you know... I just... want to let you know!"</p> <p>Marius couldn't believe his own nerve. He had really thought he was a pervert for not liking Marius. Now, here he was, his naked, erect dick pointed directly at her. Marius knew his face would be red and he could hardly breathe through the sheer nervousness that was coming from his eyes. He tried to say what he had to, but couldn't. Marius saw his face turn red. It must be that he had felt a lot of pain in his penis.</p> <p>"I... I'm so sorry, sir," Marius said sincerely.</p> <p>"Of course you are, Mr. Masud," Marius replied and touched his erection with his finger. "It was my pleasure."</p> <p>Marius turned away and looked at his back. He wondered if he really looked ridiculous standing there. He was so embarrassed. He was ashamed that he was so embarrassed. His hands felt weak. But for some reason, his erection got stronger, and he was ashamed because he wanted to impress this hot, young, buxom woman.</p> <p>Without breaking his gaze at Marius' figure, Marius quickly reached out with one hand and took Marius' dick in his hand. He tried to look at Marius' face. Marius thought he could feel the warmth of Masud's hand on the tip of his penis, but Marius' focus was on the smooth, light touch of Masud's hand on his shaft.</p> <p>"Well, my turn for a little fun," Marius added to whatever was coming about. "Are you enjoying your first date all this way?"</p> <p>Marius smiled, "Yeah... it actually kinda feels strange to have someone so... so in tune to my... your... body..." Marius trailed off and turned his attention back to his new boyfriend.</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry, kid. I won't tell anyone," Marius said and wrapped her slender fingers around his thick, long shaft.</p> <p>They looked at each other for several moments, as Marius slowly stroked his dick. She wasn't going to try to make him cum today. Marius didn't want Marius to lose. He wanted to make this guy lose. He had never lost!</p> <p>to lose forever, Marius lost and found a lot of his virginity.</p> <p>he have lost all in him. to be happy forever.</p> <p>Marius and now that's never—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
