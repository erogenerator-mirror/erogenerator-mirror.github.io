To look back upon things of former ages, as upon the manifold</h4><p><strong>changes and conversions of several monarchies and commonwealths. We may also foresee things future, for they shall all be of the same kind; neither is it possible that they should</strong> be different than our own or ours. We shall be in the hands of the same power.</p> <p>It is a matter of faith, that one must keep faith.</p> <p>~*~</p> <p>Bertram and I came to be friends among friends, but after a while we didn't make it our business. He was my old and dear friend from University, he taught at the house and he was living in our small apartment; he could only afford our apartment in the city! It was our little apartment.</p> <p>We didn't talk much about ourselves as a friend of any kind, but I did ask him a question. How did your dear wife and baby brother live in the household in our living room?</p> <p>He knew the answer but answered my questions. "She is a good wife." I said, "and we are much nearer than you." He didn't say anything but I knew he didn't want an answer. I took his hand and placed it on my cheek. I wanted him so badly, it was killing me to think of him as my lover, my lover. And he never told me more than a few things in a few days! He just kept asking me questions that are so difficult, the same questions I asked myself in the past.</p> <p>And then I took his hands off my cheek. He looked into my eyes. I wanted him to put his lips on mine and kiss me!</p> <p>In the back of my mind I tried to say nothing but I cannot. My eyes pleaded for him to put his lips on.</p> <p>We both looked at each other as we wanted to feel his lips on mine, our lips touching each other. It was such a thrill. I could feel his lips softly touching my face on my face. I was so happy. My hands reached into his shorts and tried to rub the bulge under his pants. He smiled at me and whispered in my ear, "Just relax." Then to my dismay he lifted a little and pulled down his pants and lifted his underwear just above his crotch. He slowly pushed his legs apart and sat up. His prick was already hardening. I wanted to see what he looked like, to feel the size of his dick. I saw his cock move inside his shorts. His prick was the size of a small banana, it would look just as much as when I sucked his cock.</p> <p>Bertram looked at me and saw me looking at his prick. He wanted my hand to touch the prick and I asked him to pull my fingers out of its tip. He was so fascinated with the prick! He did it for me. I had no problem getting his prick out of its shorts which it was so happy to let go in its hand. I also tried to move my fingers to my mouth. That wasn't possible for my mouth to close around his cock. I still wanted to be able to taste his prick, but I couldn't. He was so excited! I tried to move my tongue around the tip of his prick, but I could only taste the prick. I wanted to taste his cum! I wanted to taste his cum when the whole city was watching my wedding.</p> <p>I was sure that I was in heaven as he played with the prick and I was in a different world: I got to see his prick. When he took my hand and put it to his prick. I was in heaven! It is hard to describe how my hand felt on his cock. It is not normal to feel that hand when only yours is there inside mine. But that hand is inside mine! His balls were so tight. I could only squeeze it. For some time he played with my hand and I felt he was too excited. He told me that he was cummin but I didn't mind, it was so hard to concentrate on his prick. He looked like he was about to cum. He had to remove some of his strength, the way I wanted to feel his warm cum on my skin. He was very close. I touched his hands with my fingertips, but I wanted to feel the warmth of his body in my hand.</p> <p>I kept on rubbing the prick. He told me that he couldn't cum without cumming. I said that he'll love every minute the next day and that he would make it his birthday that day. I told him to stop teasing me and to fuck me.</p> <p>While he was in the bathroom I did all the washing up. I took my briefs and the rest of my underwear with my clothes and took them outside. I was so hungry to feel him in me again but I thought I best leave the bedroom. I didn't want to leave the house without my bed. I don't think it was proper. But I thought he would like that.</p> <p></p> <p>As I was dressing after a shower I was still thinking about how his prick and even though I was still thinking of the one last night together I was such a good night, he made me so happyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
