Consider with thyself how man, and by what part of his, is joined</h4><p><strong>unto God, and how that part of man is affected, when it is said to be diffused. There is nothing more wretched than that soul, which in a kind of</strong> dark heaven, has been so blind as to not see the eye of the universe. I'm looking down at this cock in its glans, and I can see what I'm looking at. Not a large cock that was made for fucking, but enough that I could put it in a girl, and put it in her. This is what I meant, so far.</p> <p>I turned to face her, and with both hands I guided my cock to her cunt. I could feel this woman's lips pressing on my cock as she began to lick the underside of my cock. Then, she lowered herself.</p> <p>I could feel her pussy lips slide over the top of my cock, and with a slight gasp, I felt the tightest pussy ever. It felt tighter around my cock, because as she slid it in, she felt so much tighter, that her cunt itself began to open to meet me. She looked up at me with those blue eyes and smiled.</p> <p>I pulled back to let the head of my cock exit her pussy, before she looked back down at me with the most seductive smile imaginable. Then, after pushing back against the force of my cock, she lowered herself onto her knees. For a brief second, I almost came at the touch of her pussy against my cock, as her breasts were pressed to the base of my head.</p> <p>I can be so careful about my cock, it's never going to enter her ass, but today, I'm going to do this. I have a perfect idea how to play this game, though. I placed those gorgeous breasts of hers, in a perfect position to feel the contact of my cock against her ass.</p> <p>With no hesitation, she began to slide her ass back against me. As I could tell that she was doing this to make it easier for me to come forward, which is something that is the last thing she has been doing in her life, she took a great deal of pleasure in it. There was nothing else in that world.</p> <p>She continued to slide herself over the head of my cock, and let me feel her ass against me. Now, just below me, I could feel her breath against my cock, so close. Her ass was so tight, so tight. It was as if the insides of her body were trying to push against my cock's head. I don't know how I can do it when your dick is as hard as a rock, but I just held my position. When I saw her head roll back as she took a breath, and she started to moan, I almost shot off my cock, but I held on.</p> <p>She was sliding herself over the head, and her ass was actually rubbing against the head of my cock. She did it to feel it push forward.</p> <p>"Oh baby," I heard her say. "Oh that's good."</p> <p>Now, here's another idea. I had only just finished, when she asked if she could ride me. I pulled her back from herself.</p> <p>"No," she said, and without taking her eyes off my cock, she took the head in by her hand. "Not now."</p> <p>"Yes baby, yes." I said. "Sit down. I want to feel you."</p> <p>"Well," she said, "that's nice."</p> <p>"Yes, indeed," I said, and sat down with her taking me in her hand again. As I stood up, it was impossible to stand up very much at all, as now, in the presence of her, I was in complete control of her by having her. It was a new turn of events, and it had given me a tremendous amount of confidence, and confidence, to be able to fuck this beautiful creature over my knees. Her legs were parted, and her pussy looked amazing. I could smell her sex, so sweet and intoxicating. I could also feel how she's ass was rubbing against my own. I could feel how that ass was gripping me, her cunt against my cock.</p> <p>"Oh god," she moaned as we both began to lean back and forth. "I love that. So good."</p> <p>The feel of her ass against mine was so wonderful. "I love it too," I agreed.</p> <p>"Good," came the response, "I wanna fuck."</p> <p>"Oh no." I thought. "We can't."</p> <p>"Well..." she said. "I'll do it."</p> <p>"It's not what you're asking for, is it?" I said.</p> <p>"No," she said. "It's not what you think. It's not what you want. And it's not what you want, either."</p> <p>I stood up and looked at her. I could see those green eyes, her smile that smile, her lips that. Even before, as I wanted to say something to her, that, to make.
