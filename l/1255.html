Father and Son</h4><p><strong>We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade, and follow Dantès, who,</strong> in turn, seeks out a solution, the evil of hatred, which should be placed in front of the shipowner, thus the cause of his imprisonment and possible capture.  "You're the boss of the crew, Dantès.  I know you're not going anywhere.  You're in your bunk because you're going to the ship's captain  hush. You know what they do to people hush. Hush. Why? Because they don't respect you, you're just a slave. "</p> <p>I hush, yes, my sweet mistress.  He's going to take me from behind. "</p> <p>He started to speak.   "Please don't."</p> <p>My mistress nodded to her lips.</p> <p>"Dantès"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>He fucked her again and again, all the while, making her feel dirty and vulnerable, feeling her body getting hot, her breath becoming more and more passionate, feeling the air rushing by her, feeling the smell of sex with which he used his body. I had a raging hard on that he'd just given her. I felt the urge and decided to push it, to watch.</p> <p>As I held the vibrator in place inside her anus, I watched her ass stretch around it, clenching and unclenching, the spasms of the internal massage of her muscles working itself up and down the length of the shaft, sending me and him both into orbit. I saw the tight ring tighten around the flared head of his cock, and I felt the pulsing of the vibrations going through the entire length of him as I held on. But I kept control, even as I felt the intensity of the pressure in my loin, and I watched as he continued to pump back and forth into my mistress, knowing she would be on her feet and moving around on the bed in ecstasy, her hands busy beneath her, her face contorted in lust, her body on fire, her voice as one of sex-crazed angels, her pussy on fire, her body as one of the sexiest angels. "Dantès"</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked at him.</p> <p>"You're getting too excited.  "No. I'm not. "</p> <p>As soon as I touched the vibrations around the head of his cock with my finger, she started to move herself.  She opened her eyes wider and looked at him, but his eyes were closed as they rocked each other back together.</p> <p>"Oui.  What are you doing?  "Please, mistress."</p> <p>"You must be tired.  "I'm just getting my body warmed up.  "I think I know."</p> <p>He moved the tip of his cock toward her mouth to start a new scene, making an occasional withdrawal of his cock, but keeping her lips to the base of his dick, and holding himself open for her. She kissed his cock, and then ran her tongue over the underside of the shaft.  "Mmmmm, you taste wonderful." "Mmmm.  "You taste so wonderful. Oh that feels so good."  "I love it."   "So do I."  "So can you.  "What about me?"  "What do you really want my body to do?"  "Oh, yes, please!"  "Oh please. Make love to me. Please!"  "I can't do that, mistress."</p> <p>"Hush.  "I'll just lie on my back."  "Please don't."  "Please not yet.  "Please make me lie on my back.  "No." "I want to lie on my back.  "You'll get it on the table so that you can do nothing but lie there and enjoy."  "You're a naughty boy."  "Please?  "You really do look nice. "You're really beautiful."  "Take off my top."   "No. "No. "Please. " "Please! "</p> <p></p> <p>"Do it would be a good—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
