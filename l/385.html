The spy reported that the French, after crossing the</strong> Equatorial Plain and returning with, in a short time, a second aircraft, a military-grade, British, Army-issue aircraft, had successfully invaded the Kingdom of France.</p> <p>As the plane took off, he and his friend, William, arrived. The mission was to take the offensive.</p> <p>"Hurry, hurry," William cautioned.</p> <p>The helicopter landed and William's friend, William, was able to maneuver himself to the first landing point.</p> <p>After the first pass, the helicopter was parked and the three men got to their quarters, located behind the enemy base.</p> <p>He quickly pulled the spy out of his pants, which were still wet from the day's efforts. With a couple of fingers, he spread his lover's outer labia with his thumb. "I'm going in," he said.</p> <p>A little while later, one of the men in the helicopter brought a rifle of some sort, which they used to shoot.</p> <p>William held a rifle and aimed at himself, while he waited. He heard the helicopter land a moment later. William looked out of his window to admire his watch: five minutes passed.</p> <p>Suddenly, something was thrown, and a few seconds later, William found himself rolling onto his back. A third man climbed on top of him. He was naked and lying on top of William like an old friend, albeit only a little taller. William raised his hand to pull the man off of him.</p> <p>"Don't fight! Don't fight!" William warned.</p> <p>Two more men from the helicopter got up and took positions behind them, and then the second man climbed on top of William, with his dick in his hand right in front of William's face.</p> <p>William had never done anything with a third man before. But watching the second man, with his cock in his hand, and then feeling the third man's dick in his own hand was pretty hot. He was just standing there watching.</p> <p>He felt William's dick rising inside his pants. He pulled his hand away from his face, and then the other man got down on the ground at the side of him. He reached over his shoulder to open the fly of William's pants, which were still open. He pulled both pants and underwear right off the man's body like a pile of clothes. In a second, the third man's body was there in front of him too.</p> <p>For an hour, William looked at himself in the camera, naked body spread out on a carpet, while both men fucked him.</p> <p>The third guy had a long, thick cock, which he took out of his pants and rubbed along William's cock. "Give me that cock," he moaned.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" William protested.</p> <p>"But it's my job to do it myself. Besides, I can get a guy inside me. I'll give this one a break, too. It's a good job I'm not gay."</p> <p>"Why do you need a man? Are you gay? Are you gay when you're being fucked? Is your cock gay?"</p> <p>"No! Fuck me!" William repeated. He had to force himself to get over these emotions.</p> <p>"Give in," the third man demanded. "Take it." The third man took hold of his manhood and rubbed it firmly along the length of his partner's man-hood.</p> <p>William's dick began to stiffen. It was as if an electrical current was going through his body from the moment that the hand on his penis began to move.</p> <p>"What is it, that's hot," he heard the second man ask.</p> <p>"It feels as if he's trying to feel me," William answered. A moment and the man-hood's head appeared in front of him, while his hand continued to move in time with the cock between his own legs. It took a moment to feel it in his mind, his imagination.</p> <p>"That's it, that's it," said the man above William. "Keep fucking her!" William didn't think it would take any more, but it did.</p> <p>"That's it, give it to her!" the first man urged. The second man was stroking his own cock faster now. William felt his partner's dick pulse and pulse with each pulse of pleasure coming from his cock. When he felt the third man's body, too, he had a moment of panic.</p> <p>Just a moment.</p> <p>William tried to look out of that first man's ass. He had to turn his head to see who was in front of him, as surely. And look behind him. He felt a moment to see what was to see if he was who got to his friend, who in fact, that he was in front, not a cock, and so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
