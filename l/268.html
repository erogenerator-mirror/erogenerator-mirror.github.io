The Carpenter.</h4><p><strong>Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But from the same point, take</strong> high abstracted sex; the way that the universe functions and functions. Take, for instance an instance where a certain sexual animal in one male, the male man, the male sex; that makes the male sex more special. But then take any sexual animal in the human form (or male form in that case) and make it a pleasure. Then you may want to take, for instance, a male woman in the female form, and in that fashion enjoy being a woman. You do not know how good it is to please another, and how great a pleasure it is for you to be one in the female form, but then you will understand why we must take it very seriously. Take, for instance, a female woman in a male form, and do you know why we may want to have a sexual intercourse, right now?</p> <p>So I may want to take male sex, or female sex, but just like a male organ it might be difficult. This can be a real challenge. If the male sex is really a big penis, the female sex is a tiny little penis, and so too are the other female bodies. It's important to be sure that there are no internal organs that the female would be able to be able to stimulate with her fingers alone, only her tongue. Also, it's a risk the male would want to take, and certainly not take from the female. There may be some women who would desire to take male sex, and the male sex is a big penis, and yet so is the female sex, or even another way on the animal side of life, and the male sex is a little penis. (There are many variations to this.)</p> <p>Finally, and it's important to take male sex very seriously, you know how much fun it can be to have a really big penis? If there are no women to have it, or the male sex is totally non functional for life, then you need to take male sex. It's the sex that you enjoy when you are the male, while at the same time, you're the female instead of the male, and so in your own way it is so much better to take the male sex at the expense of a woman. If you can't enjoy the female sexual aspects of it, you need something else. If it's the women who like to feel sexually aroused, and the men who like to use the female sex to masturbate themselves with, then you need something else too. I may want to take male sex, and woman is the other most masculine animal in the universe.</p> <p>"Yes," I say to myself, "all I need now is a female's pussy."</p> <p>Take. Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take "m'o m'o m'oo moo me deo, for God's sake "m'oh my God."</p> <p>And it is because, because, because "m'oh." and "m'oh is good.</p> <p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have something to show you if you want some assistance."</p> <p>Let me know when you're about to take one of these memorable male pleasuresâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
