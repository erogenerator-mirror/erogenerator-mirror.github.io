Mr. Sherlock Holmes</h4><p><strong>Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. I</strong> was standing up to go to the check out, but Mr. Holmes was in his reading room again. I asked him if I could come in today – I thought I would give him a nice kiss.</p> <p>He was a good looking teenager, and I was a very sexy twenty year old girl he was very interested in. I was also wearing my favorite perfume, which gave him a nice hard-on and made my pussy juices wet. When I saw him standing up, I thought it was a sign of respect and appreciation, so I kissed his cheek while he came to sit down next to me. The moment we kissed, the thought that I was his teacher's daughter crossed my mind.</p> <p>I turned and kissed him, then whispered in his ear. "Do you really like your teacher's name?"</p> <p>After kissing him a little, I walked up to my room behind him and leaned over to give him a nice quick kiss. We were like old friends from first grade to late teens, and we just knew that we wanted a sexual relationship.</p> <p>We then undressed together, and I felt his hands caress my body through the thin material of my underwear. I was already moist and hot, and Mr. Holmes' touch made me even hotter. I didn't put much thought into being sexy and hot at all, and was enjoying the feeling of his hands on my body more than anything. He started to kiss my neck, and then sucked on my earlobe. After a brief second, Mr. Holmes' mouth left my body, and walked over to the bed. He climbed on top of it, and I got up on my hands and knees and presented myself for him.</p> <p>"Come on, Mr. Holmes, give me that hard cock." He was very excited, and we decided to make it the ultimate act of surrender. I was very, very wet, and hoped that the feeling he gave me would make me as hot as possible.</p> <p>He got behind me and entered the condom, then he started to go into me and then out of me, making me wetter and wetter every time. It wasn't long before we made love together, and his thrusts got harder and deeper as the feeling between us increased. I was getting very aroused by the moment, and he was enjoying it too. Suddenly, I felt that warm rush from the base of my neck, through my entire body - I couldn't stop myself. Then I started to make him groan as I made him explode inside me. At the same time as Mr. Holmes emptied his load inside of me, I felt the warm fluid of his erection as it made its way deep inside of me.</p> <p>The feeling of having his big cock inside of me brought me to orgasm. When I came, it didn't take long after I had been making love to my husband. We took a long shower together in the shower – soaping each other all over, feeling each other's bodies as we licked and kissed each other's bodies. After we finished showering, we dried each other and I led him to my bedroom. It wasn't a sex-filled room, in any case.</p> <p>It was just a bed on which I had a sheet on the ground. I wanted to make sure I didn't have anything on my body that would give us any lasting marks on my body. I laid down on my bed, and Mr. Holmes got close to me, and started to kiss my forehead. "You have great eyes, Mom."</p> <p>"They were beautiful yesterday when we saw your face in the mirror. You're absolutely beautiful." I smiled at him. I really wanted to look down on my face in the face of the man who I imagined myself just a little older than myself and a lot older in the right circumstances, but couldn't make the right choice and I knew what he meant by that.</p> <p>After my eyes closed to let my body relax, I saw a nice pair of lips moving to caress mine. Then my nipples started to move against them. "This feels so nice."</p> <p>"You're a great kisser, Mom." He leaned on his right side and kissed my neck, my shoulders, and my neck. By the time he kissed my right side, my arms were moving around him. After kissing both of my nipples at the same time, he started to kiss my breasts, then one of my boobs, and then the other. When I opened my eyes, it was completely dark, and the whole room was bathed in the light of our lovemaking. I felt so warm and wet, and I knew that I was ready to go for a little more.</p> <p>that he started sucking on my left boob a kiss just below where my right breast. I was a small a nipple and "I asked the nipple he started to the left, kissing just a bit below my breast his lips.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>" I started to the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
