It had filled her ears with the sound of her best friend, the singer of “Pretty, Pink” to the tune of “Sweetheart,” but it was the sound of Mary’s friends singing in the other room, and just like that.</p> <p>Mary never had to guess where she was thinking. Her best friend and cousin were going to listen to the words of her favourite song on her favorite radio station and they were going to have the same opinion on what her best friend sang.</p> <p>She was going to get on the microphone to hear her best friend’s words! “I am not a slut…I am not a…I am not a…I am a…I am a...” she heard from the speakers in front of her, to which the speakers hummed. Her best friend Mary was the same age as her mum and only knew one other person as a friend – the other girl.</p> <p>Mary started laughing – loud. In her mind, it was just the sound of her friend’s words echoing in her ears as she listened. She started to sing the words that was just going to happen anyway to. She sang like it was the lyrics. “Yes, I’m your whore…I’m your cum slut…I’m your bitch…I’m your cum slut…”</p> <p>Mary sang the lyrics to herself. She sang it like a song that her best friend was going to be singing. She sang it over and over. She sang the words that would please the viewers of any porn site; she sang with a slow, soft, seductive rhythm that sent a shock through the viewers of the radio. Mary sang like one of the greatest American heroes.</p> <p>Mary always thought her life would have been the happiest, if only she had been a little more mature. It wasn’t long before Mary was to know that she wasn’t the best – she was the luckiest. Her best friend was just a star to have on that stage, and the next stage to be found with her music. She even sang something, “I’m just a whore…all guys want a real whore…”</p> <p>Mary never had a problem with the thought of the guys who paid for her to have sex. She always liked to think, that they paid for her to make a porn movie, and she never knew anything about the actors who were always there. She never knew if she was the best when she’s doing an amazing job; she never knew what she’d like for a sex scene.</p> <p>Mary always thought, that when her parents left, there would be a chance that they would have to look at her porn film to see if it was better. It would be the porn industry she was interested in. And then again, it would be the reason why she was so special to them.</p> <p>It seemed Mary had never done anything without an education, and if she hadn’t gotten this degree as a professional, then she could’ve been the best actress on the planet. But she wasn’t. She could still be a star, even if she chose to be. And she certainly would be a porn actress.</p> <p>No, Mary was really afraid. Of what would happen if she decided to try to make porn films and start an industry. She’d always been afraid that one day she might be given something that she might find impossible to make, and what she wanted to be was a good film. It was hard to make a film of anything like her film. The biggest porn industry on earth had just finished their movie “Pretty Pink”, and was about to film something for a porn movie. It had cost a fortune, but when the producers decided to put the movie in the box, the money was worth a lot, not to mention the quality of the movie.</p> <p>It was only a few months ago that Mary had been looking for a way to make something that she would never say was perfect for her. Even though it wasn’t a film, it was an erotic movie that she wanted to make. It was just an erotic movie. Mary knew that if she just made a porn film, it wouldn’t be so bad.</p> <p>Mary wasn’t a big fan of porn films, and she never would admit it. But not to a criticism. But as a porn actress, Mary also a big hit or a major star. She was in a bit of the porn slut actress in porn star in porn. Some porn flick actress, but famous film, a porn actress. She wanted to have a bit it to be a star—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
