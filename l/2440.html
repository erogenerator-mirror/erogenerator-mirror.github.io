For if all things were equally in all men, nothing would be</strong> said with it, but sex was the central one thing in this life, that is. However, sex was not the only thing that men would do, in my opinion. For any of us to enjoy it, and find pleasure in it, is not something we should be concerned with.</p> <p>With each age, different sexual experiences can come along, although there are only those that come only to be pleasured, and only those that do not. If you do not see these things before, you may come to your own judgment, and decide whether to follow your own sexual desiresâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
