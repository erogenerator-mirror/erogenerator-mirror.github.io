A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the house. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year, July. Basket chairs,</strong> benches, etc is in front of us.</p> <p>When I walked in, he was still in the middle of the room. No lights were on. The room was so small there were no walls. He had a bottle of wine in his hands. It was open. Glasses with sparkling stones on the inside. There is candles. I took a little sip of the wine.</p> <p>"How about a glass?"</p> <p>He nodded his head and pulled out a wine glass and the bottle.</p> <p>"Let me," he said.</p> <p>He slid the glass to my lips and then slowly poured me some more wine.</p> <p>"Here, let me."</p> <p>He walked around me and slowly removed my jacket and top. I was wearing something like a white sweater, buttoned all the way down except it had a knot at the back. On my boobs they were on show. But he left it open.</p> <p>On his other hands he started unhooking my bra. It went and was out of the way when he removed my shirt.</p> <p>"Let's see your chest."</p> <p>He pulled and fondled my breasts. He had not touched my nipples yet.</p> <p>"Now I want to see your bush."</p> <p>Then he knelt next to the bed.</p> <p>I could feel his breath on my skin. He removed my trousers slowly. I was wearing white panties that I just unzipped to let him in.</p> <p>He took out a finger and began fingering me. I started moaning a bit.</p> <p>"You are too tight. I can't take you completely up inside."</p> <p>I felt him putting pressure on my clit with his hand. I started squirming. He felt my clit. Then I heard a knock on the door. It was him in the bedroom.</p> <p>"Oh, I thought I told you to leave alone at the Manor House."</p> <p>He undressed. He had a big dick.</p> <p>"Come upstairs again. I like that."</p> <p>He got on and we kissed. His hands were allover me.</p> <p>He was kissing me. And when he got me on his mouth, he began kissing my boobs.</p> <p>I wanted him to go down on me. I wanted him inside my vagina, making me feel the pleasure of his mouth on my pussy.</p> <p>But when he was about to penetrate, he pulled back and asked him to put his dick in me.</p> <p>"Do you like that?"</p> <p>"It's nice."</p> <p>I went down on him slowly. My vagina stretched as much as it could up to the tip. My boobs hung there. He pushed his dick inside me. It was not very long and I got it in all the way. I was panting. In no time we were in the center of each other. We were panting as we tried to get maximum pleasure.</p> <p>"That's it. Move it back and put your whole weight on my cock..."</p> <p>I got my hand on my clitoris. I slowly rolled it. It was like fireworks.</p> <p>"Do the same with a different hole..." I heard him breathing heavily.</p> <p>After I inserted it again, he started going faster. I could feel his cum inside his penis.</p> <p>I got up and we kissed again. He then got on his knees and his penis was inside my vagina again. It was making me excited.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck me, you bastard!"</p> <p>In only seconds we both came together.</p> <p>There was nothing in reality but two people.</p> <p>Next week: Monday -- The Party</p> <p>After lunch I was waiting for him when he came round the house and he wanted to fuck me.</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"Your husband is not here."</p> <p>"No, my husband is not here."</p> <p>"He is already in his room."</p> <p>"That's impossible."</p> <p>"Maybe, it's the way I am."</p> <p>He got on the bed and we kissed. Then he took out his cock.</p> <p>"If you know what I want, do it! I want to fuck you in a new way."</p> <p>I went down on him. I did not know what he wanted me to do. So I just held his dick. He had already cum a little. There was lots of fresh cum. I was waiting for him to make love to me. What did he want me to do, I asked him.</p> <p>"Suck me."</p> <p>He pulled my skirt off. I felt cold and wet when I was sucking him. His penis was cold, and it was hard as usual. a long without being a man. the way you want, he used to hold you, but sometimes.
