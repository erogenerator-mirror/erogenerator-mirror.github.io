THE RAT-HOLE.</h4><p><strong>The reader must permit us to take him back to the Place de Grève, which we quitted yesterday with Gringoire, in order to follow la Esmeralda. It is ten o’clock</strong> am in London, and the book should be finished by eleven am, so take the time to read the book, as if it is your entire lifetime. However, if you are on the train to London, take your time, and read it as your own private thought. We love reading it. It is quite the book for us. It will be of great value to you for many years to come.</p> <p>1.</p> <p>As far as we can recall, that was the night we wrote it – which was the last time we spent apart at times – and then, when it became clear that we needed to be apart, our writing began again just that day.</p> <p>At that moment in December, we began to write. We wrote about the two of us having a sexual orgy in our apartment during the evening. We wrote about the feel of another man’s penis inside of us during the night. We wrote about how he fucked our vaginas – it became more interesting when I made a point to call it that – or how he fucked my asshole – and how our mutual masturbation helped him to please me by making me feel as horny as I did, feeling good as good, feeling sexy about myself – all while, of course, not having to watch each other or touch each other.</p> <p>My writing was very positive, really. I thought it would get better for us too.</p> <p>And, of course, it did, with me being the author of four book, most of which are the same as ours and no one was really paying us for their efforts to create fiction. However, we enjoyed ourselves very much in our work.</p> <p>Our sexual work was very romantic, even romantic.</p> <p>We wrote a very sexual novel.</p> <p>It was very erotic and it was about two people who loved to read and write their own stories, including the ones about me and the other man.</p> <p>We also wrote a book on how to make love to another woman, by fucking her up the ass, by riding her to orgasm, by getting her to go to bed with another woman, by having sex with another man – just by having sex with a man.</p> <p>You’ll have to understand, of course, that there is no penis, but actually a woman who likes to have her ass rubbed by a man’s cock – or rather a woman who likes to have her ass fucked by a man.</p> <p>I enjoyed it very much too.</p> <p>We wrote about two women who enjoyed it too, not because they had a penis, mind you, but because they had a pussy – although there is a penis – which they loved doing to each other.</p> <p>We loved each other almost as much as our lives did, so when we realized that the book was about two women and two men – especially with the fact that it was already available – we decided to copy it. It was a very romantic, romantic and erotic novel, and it would not have been published without making love with a woman.</p> <p>We wrote about having sex during the day, while we were together, while we were shopping, while we were in the supermarket when it was our next day when we were in downtown, while we were at a restaurant, while we were dancing at the restaurant, while we were sitting together in a café, while we were kissing and making love, while lying down and watching TV, while we were having breakfast and watching TV, while we were talking and walking, while we had sex together. Since it was a romantic and erotic novel, we knew that we probably shouldn’t write such things about ourselves since it would be offensive to someone our parents would find out that we were having sex with another man. That would only make it even more erotic and even more dangerous to anyone reading it, especially a woman.</p> <p>Of course, we were aware of that fact before we started this particular novel, because we didn’t want to seem to have sex with anyone at home, because we were all going to have to go home and have sex with our mom because she wasn’t going to take any chances that she might be catching us fucking. That’s how we got the novel, although it is certainly not because we wanted to write it on the bed ourselves.</p> <p>So it is up to you to decide whether you’d like to read it on your own.</p> <p>To have a good story to read, we wrote about sex, specifically a story of two women having an erotic, sexual affair together.</p> <p>2.</p> <p>In case you’s not familiar with the story, some readers may remember it as an erotic tale of two women, rather than two women having an incestuous sex, lesbian sex, between them, or not having lesbian affairs. There are no such story could be lesbian and two things with two, with two? If two? This story was between them of lesbians not even?
