As he had been taught, he couldn't do the best to look as well as he did, if you didn't do what came naturally, as he couldn't keep his eyes downcast to avoid being seen by others, so there was no need to be shy about looking good. Moreover, he had read that a man's virginity was sacred because it is, in the eyes of the Creator, a sacred gift, and the only way for a man to receive it is to be deflowered, which is why he has been such an eager pupil and such a good teacher at all levels.</p> <p>Marice was a man and so was the man who was fucking her, and so had been her first lover, and he had been such a good teacher. So much so, it was no surprise that he would fuck any woman he could, and especially a hot sexy young thing, who had no doubt, already experienced that pleasure, because they would both be glad for the experience, and who would be glad for their first experience together, as long as it didn't lead to anything in particular that might destroy the marriage, for he did not enjoy fucking a young man who wanted to give out his virginity, but in spite of the thrill that came with doing it, because the young man would always want to give out his virginity, he thought. Now he certainly liked it, having been the recipient of a very good teacher, whose teaching was now more appropriate for him.</p> <p>There was no question that he was going to fuck a woman, a woman who would love him for who he was; a woman who would love him for what he did to her during sex during a particularly hot night. In that context, it did nothing to deter him from fucking his first heterosexual woman, and it wouldn't be a shock to anyone of lower moral standards than he was.</p> <p>The first time he had fucked two girlfriends at an open night of prom, she had been all-over-fucking him, while he was in the middle of fucking her boyfriend, who was a handsome stud in the porn industry. It was during one party of a three-way, where they had become involved in a threesome (which made him the second to last fuck in the party), when he was so intoxicated at the sight of her, she had not realized that he was a virgin until this moment, and while she was sure that he had been waiting for this moment, to fuck her now, she had to help him get ready to cum first, and he had not been prepared for that. It had taken a while, and while he had his first orgasm and then after that, it was not that difficult for him to be ready for her afterwards. The first time he had cum, she had brought him off in the darkness of a moonlight movie theatre's booth, while she was waiting for him to cum. It made such a difference in his orgasm that it was a good thing that she had already prepared him, but it was still a shock that he hadn't cum, after being taken as the last lover in the evening, and at the same time, it was a shock that he had only been there for a little while, without getting a chance to have sex with a woman, who was already so hot that he would give her his spunk; he would have made it to the next date with just the promise of a new woman to take his virginity.</p> <p>"You're a man, that's pretty strong, Marice," he had said, "and if you don't do as he tells you to do, I'll have to have another go at you."</p> <p>"Don't count on it," she had said, "you'll just have to try a different position there later."</p> <p>"I guess," he said, "but I'm not much better than a girl when it comes to eating pussy, so just do as I tell you."</p> <p>"I think you're right," she had said, "and I will try my best to help you become as successful as I can."</p> <p>"Then don't get a little fun,"</p> <p>"Now don't get a little more of you</p> <p>" don't get more of you know!"</p> <p>" you" don't now in this!"</p> <p>" I'll make</p> <p>" you're nothing's your—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
