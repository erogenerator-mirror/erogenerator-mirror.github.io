OF THE SIGNIFICATION IN SCRIPTURE OF KINGDOME OF GOD, OF</h4><p><strong>HOLY, SACRED, AND SACRAMENT</strong>O,</p> <p>MONDAY A.M.</p> <p>A couple of days after we made passionate love, I was home in the dorm room in my room. I'd already prepared dinner and watched a DVD on TV, and a few moments of silence. I was so comfortable and calm during the evening, I felt good and comfortable, like I'd known and enjoyed every moment with my boyfriend. But tonight, I was dressed with nothing on and had just been out for a romantic stroll and a late night run. I was not sure I could make it with all my new, innocent energy in life. I started getting nervous.</p> <p>I was trying to find the courage to get home, but when I tried running across my bedroom in the darkened room, there was no sign of my clothes. I ran across the bathroom and went to bed, but when I turned into my bedroom, I saw the clothes on the floor. I quickly undressed and dropped my clothes onto the bed. I was not disappointed. My panties had no pockets and the black lace was a little wet. I knew that she could have been wearing something underneath. I took a couple of deep breaths, grabbed my clothes and ran into the bathroom to put my clothes in the hamper.</p> <p>As soon as I reached into the hamper, I pulled out a thin black thong. It was very uncomfortable, but I didn't care. I pulled it on. I was wearing a sheer bra with a very thin layer of fabric in front, which did not hide the fact that I was wearing nothing underneath. I held my bra up. It did not do any good to hide my nipples, which were clearly visible now, and I felt very uncomfortable. I put my bra on once again, and this time, I felt very sexy. I ran into my room again and went to bed. I lay on my side and reached under my pillow to grab my panties. As soon as my hands touched the fabric, I felt cold and realized I was not wearing a bra. It felt very nice under my bra; the fabric felt like a thin strip of black. I slipped my panties onto and sat under the bed. I quickly put my bra on and sat quietly on my side. I slowly started breathing and thought about my friend and what that would have meant when my nipples began to stiffen.</p> <p>I thought about my girlfriend's friend from school, Amy, but instead, I looked at her body. I wondered about her breasts and her nipples. I briefly wondered if she could really hold a breast like my friend could. It was hard not to want to touch my body after watching so much of the video I'd watched. I decided I'd have an even better time. I closed my eyes because of the feeling of my skin. I ran my finger along my cleft and felt my lips. The cold was very enjoyable.</p> <p>I remembered how Amy's breasts were soft and the thin material felt much better. I recalled Amy's hair in the summer and how nice her body was. I closed my legs and imagined Amy with her mouth, her lips and tongue. I gently touched myself and soon my clit stood free, and I felt myself growing wetter with my own moistness, much more than the thin fabric of my underwear.</p> <p>I ran my finger over the fabric and into my damp hole and felt my juices wetting the cloth. I slipped inside myself and explored, feeling the slickness on my finger.</p> <p>I had to stop this before it went too far.</p> <p>I slowly got off the bed and ran back through my house, down to the bathroom, and looked in. I felt embarrassed and excited. My boyfriend had made my lingerie in his room, and it smelled of my pussy. I stood under the shower, wetting myself and ran my hands through my hair. I was now looking at my body in the mirror and began thinking about that night.</p> <p>After an evening of hot sex, my boyfriend was gone. I wondered if he would have wanted me to stay the night, because it meant that he would sleep naked. I wondered what he would do now that he knew his girlfriend had gone to bed and was feeling restless, but I knew there was not much else to imagine as it was. Then I realized that maybe his girlfriend would not want to wear something like panties and make myself feel sexy. I imagined what my boyfriend would think of her, if he noticed her panties that had been getting wet, and how sexy she would be. I imagined how her body would be, without her breasts.</p> <p>I couldn't help myself. I found myself thinking of her. I wondered if my body belonged to her. After all, I'd heard about her in our conversation in the dorm and she was probably the first person from my boyfriend. Was a girl. She's roommate and her roommate were the new boyfriend. I was her new roommate.</p> <p></p> <p>I was thinking about feeling so sexy, so niceâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
