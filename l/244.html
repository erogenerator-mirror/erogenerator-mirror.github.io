Jonah Historically Regarded.</h4><p><strong>Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But</strong> enough about that later.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The next day Sarah arrived at Sarah's office. After a brief discussion, Sarah sat down at her desk and made the necessary arrangements. When the girl reached over for an envelope with some paperwork in it, Sarah stopped her. "Is there going to be room for me?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," said Sarah. "Are you feeling better?"</p> <p>The girl smiled sweetly. "Of course. And yes, there is room, Sarah."</p> <p>The girl opened up the box of legal contracts and found a copy of the Declaration. Then she picked up a legal pad and pointed toward the back of the desk. "Here."</p> <p>Sarah picked the pad back up and brought it to her eyes. "Sarah, these are some of the documents you will need to take into this class."</p> <p>"I'll just put them on my desk" the girl said, handing Sarah with her legal pad.</p> <p>Before Sarah got to her class, Sarah was distracted by a strange feeling in the back of her mind, which she couldn't explain. Her eyes darted around her classroom, studying the students waiting for her desk. For a brief second, Sarah felt self-conscious about how she looked. Then she realized that she also felt excited and excited about the class and its contents.</p> <p>At that moment, Sarah decided that she did not know how to explain herself, but she had to prove that she was worthy of the job she had just been given.</p> <p>Sarah had been sent to her favorite library for years to study history. It was called "The Library of Scientific Knowledge," and the students were thrilled to learn that all the major courses of study and all the historical facts that made up the library were taken from the library itself. Sarah always felt that she should feel better about her life than about her classmates' lives.</p> <p>Sarah sat down and started writing on her pad. She was writing for the first time since she had been allowed to enter her class.</p> <p>The girl didn't seem to notice her as Sarah's eyes kept wandering toward the back of Sarah's desk. A few students had noticed that Sarah's blouse had become unbuttoned, and Sarah had to struggle to hide her blushing face when one of her classmates walked up to Sarah and whispered that it had been her.</p> <p>Sarah blushed too. She had come off the pages a lot more modest about herself. She felt embarrassed even though she knew that she wasn't the only person who had noticed, but Sarah felt that maybe she might have made some kind of a bad move.</p> <p>Sarah was very relieved when her class finally finished.</p> <p>"Sarah," Sarah said to no one in particular, "did you just come from the library? It is almost noon and you look stressed out."</p> <p>"I think I have an excuse to be in a class," the girl replied.</p> <p>"I can't imagine how, thank you very much."</p> <p></p> <p>Sarah finished up her paper and followed the girl out to the waiting room. She was wearing a white dress with a pair of black heels.</p> <p>"I really like your dress, Sarah," the girl said. "It's something that you usually wear around this school."</p> <p>"Yeah. I think I'll be wearing it around here every day." Sarah felt a tear fall down her cheek and she brushed it away.</p> <p>Sarah had to take her eyes off the girl before she could continue. The girl looked up briefly but Sarah didn't notice at all. Sarah had been brought up, after all. She could be wrong.</p> <p>"Is there anything I can help you with?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>"No," the girl replied.</p> <p>Sarah turned to leave. "I would really like to talk to you about it later."</p> <p>"Really? And how?"</p> <p>The girl hesitated.</p> <p>"Sarah, how do you feel about your life today?" the girl asked.</p> <p>Sarah thought about telling the girl that she wanted to go to the library before class was over, but she was afraid of what would happen if she did. And then Sarah remembered that she had not gone there at all.</p> <p>"Sarah, how does your body feel?" the girl asked. Sarah wasn't sure about this girl at all.</p> <p>"It feels just fine, Sarah."</p> <p>"Do you know why you're in front of me?"</p> <p>"I don't think I know, Sarah" the girl replied.</p> <p>"No, not really, I do not think," Sarah lied.</p> <p>Sarah looked down. She felt like she was blushing.</p> <p>"Do you see, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, what's there's nothing to explain, I just a lot?" the girl asked me don't explain, Sarah" Sarah. You are fine."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Sarah is a little please leaveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
