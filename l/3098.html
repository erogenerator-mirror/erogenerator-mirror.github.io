There could</strong> be no other day.</p> <p>When he came back to earth she was dressed in the most boring summer dress uniform, one that was too simple to wear in front of a hundred people. The dress was black on the white cotton shirt, and its hemline was tied down in front by a simple cotton panty. The shirt was tucked in neatly in front by a tiny button. Mary didn't notice that she was standing less than fifty feet from him at that moment—it was just what he needed.</p> <p>Mary looked around for the man she saw. She could see that he didn't want to miss one minute of it, so she walked to him, still holding one hand out. "Hi!" she whispered in his ear. "Ready for a walk?" She reached back and rubbed her hand up and down in front of his shirt, enjoying the soft touch. "Ready to give me one of these?" she asked in her sweetest voice.</p> <p>"I don't think I ever will!" He said enthusiastically, and she felt the soft touch of his hands on her bare shoulders. She leaned back from him, her arms folded against her chest. She could still feel his gentle hands as they kneaded her upper arms and the tops of her breasts on her chest.</p> <p>Without thinking, Mary brought her arms through his, and pulled his face down to hers. His arms enveloped her waist, and she felt her skirt being lifted upward. Then there was nothing below her waist, and she felt the soft material of his undershirt pressing lightly against her panties. Her eyes closed, she relaxed in his arms, and Mary felt her panties get wetter and wetter from the thought that she was really going to do him a big favor by letting him fuck her for an audience in public. She felt her body stiffen and tensed, but he just held her and said, "You feel so sexy!"</p> <p>He pulled her back to him, and she felt her knees go weak. His mouth found her ear and she could feel his lips as his tongue traced her skin. He could feel her heart pounding against her chest, and he knew that he just might have to break away from her ear first, since she couldn't have an easy time feeling his warmth without him.</p> <p>Mary knew she only had to do one thing. She moved her arms up his back to push him further down, and she moved her hips forward and back to get him in a good place. "Oh, god!" she thought, "This guy is so fucking good at that, girl!"</p> <p>When his lips touched her neck, Mary felt the soft pressure of his body on her, not feeling him. This time she felt a small rush of excitement, and she felt the first warmth on her neck as his lips slowly slid down to her shoulder.</p> <p>Mary let out a soft sigh of pleasure as his lips touched her skin. She felt his lips kiss the upper part of her neck. Then another kiss, a little higher up on her neck. She felt his lips touching her skin on the other side of her neck.</p> <p>One of her hands reached behind her and pulled down his shorts. His penis was hard against her chest; her breath warmed the bare skin of her neck. She gently moved her fingers around it and felt the throbbing hard cock in her hand. She knew how to keep herself from having thoughts like that about anyone other than herself. And even fewer knew how to keep from masturbating this guy's cock without thinking about herself.</p> <p>She took his cock in her hands, feeling his veins, listening to the rhythm of his heartbeat. The skin was smooth and white against her palms. She pulled his stiff dick down and began to stroke his shaft with her fingertips. "Wow!" Mary thought. "He's so hard! So hard! I can barely touch it!"</p> <p>"Wow, Mary!" she thought again. "How does that feel?"</p> <p>"Well," she said with a smile, "I never realized that I was so horny!"</p> <p>"Me neither! I really wanted sex that first day! This is so sexy!"</p> <p>Before Mary could finish speaking, something happened. He had his entire body stiff and he was pushing her forward onto her feet. The cold wetness on her cheeks made her freeze. She felt his hard dick on her cheeks, just below her nose, right then and there. Her breath felt warm on her. After holding her face firmly against his chest, she pulled his face to hers. Their lips came together, and they kissed passionately until his lips were dry enough to touch her cheeks and could not. The air back again. They kissed in every kiss, and he felt a small kisses—and each, as long and just feeling his lips just the tongue touching their breath. It's mouths would be wetness against her lips. His hands would find a kiss on her lips so long, his mouth, soft, they would touch their lips—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
