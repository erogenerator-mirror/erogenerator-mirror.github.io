He hath got loose from the bonds of his body, and perceiving that</h4><p><strong>within a very little while he must of necessity bid the world farewell, and leave all these things behind him, he wholly applied himself, as to righteousness in all his</strong> hearts, to the task of providing for the good of mankind his own destiny. A very very lonely and lonely existence, and a very lonely and miserable life, and he, for a reason he'd never tell anybody. His own parents. He, for a reason not to mention anyone. And his other reasons, as he always did, were his own faults, as he always did, and he'd not let his own parents do this to him. And he really could not help but, in his heart, pity on those he loved. They would not love each other. That's the only reason. Even though he never spoke his own name at all, nor even thought of himself as a person himself, the only reason, except as such, that he felt anything for the good of humanity.</p> <p>"I've missed you so much, and I still don't know what to do about it." He could tell that the sadness in his voice made him break up with anyone. Especially his mother, as such. She always seemed to love him, like he was more than just her. He remembered as much, as many others did.</p> <p>He didn't really want to remember her; it would be disrespectful of him, but that didn't matter. He missed her for who she really was, to whom she was still the most important person in his life. He didn't want to forget, either, but he didn't want to feel like he was just another member of a lower class society, just another notch on the belt of a social club in which he really didn't belong.</p> <p>And then he met someone from the same social club he had once belonged to. He'd been in a couple of clubs, too. But after meeting her, they parted, for the first time in so many years, to go their separate ways. Only they wouldn't remember her. And he'd never forget her.</p> <p>And yet he'd already forgotten her. The most important person in all of this was a very nice, extremely beautiful and very, very sexy and very lonely, very, very lonely woman who didn't have a name, but couldn't even keep herself from being her own person for very long, very long.</p> <p>"Why do you look at me just like you always do?" She asked, almost with a sneer, although perhaps not quite in a mocking tone. "You were always staring at my ass."</p> <p>She was a big blonde whose dress was cut very low. Of course, that meant that she was wearing quite a lot of pantyhose, and that, unlike the rest of the girls' dresses, she usually wore stockings. Though, she often did, because the stockings were her trademark, and not her uniform. She wore a lot of stockings.</p> <p>He hated that they were her stockings themselves. And the fact that she always had very high, very high heels, and so high and high that it almost seemed like she was high on the heels of her own feet. Though, that was also exactly what he supposed it was. She never wore stockings, but she always had those pretty blue, shiny little, pretty stockings.</p> <p>She always had the little blue, shiny blue stockings, and they always seemed to do that for her, to make life even worse, which of course was why he always looked at her ass all the time, and so, when she walked around in her stockings her stockings had little, tiny little things to do with it, too.</p> <p>When he'd just seen her. Her stocking tops and her legs were always very tight, and they always seemed to stick tightly with her, whenever he looked at them. Only, once, in a few weeks he'd looked at her in the way that he used to look at her in the park. She hadn't been there in a while, but in her case it was only just, perhaps, a few times. And that was definitely the reason why she'd always looked at him as if he was an alien, and she was the only woman he wanted to date for long, long, long time.</p> <p>At that precise moment, her stockinged toes in his hair, he lost it like a stone. Without even a little effort, he began to pull his hair back, as if it were the last of the locks on the head, and as soon as she saw that he'd pulled it back, she began to laugh in her joy, and he began to laugh too.</p> <p>"How the hell did you ever get all those stocking seams up your legs, even though you had everything already, and you are wearing those stockings every single stockings on your legs?" she'd ask in the one of many, many many, many times. She'd ask him as he knew. Sometimes she couldn't even in a million and even if there and him would not even if there and not the entire society hadâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
