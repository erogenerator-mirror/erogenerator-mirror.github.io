There was hardly anyone in the streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or</strong> laughter. The shops had been largely empty for a week. It had a new manager, a new employee and a new boss.</p> <p>He looked around as the door slid open.</p> <p>"Hey there. Is everything alright?" A young girl behind the counter asked him.</p> <p>"Yeah, it'll be just in time," he replied as his gaze dropped to her cleavage, which were so much bigger than his previous visit, "let me give you a lift home." She smiled at him and gave him her keys.</p> <p>His hand slipped into the pockets. "I'm sorry, but it's not a very good idea," he apologised.</p> <p>He walked on in search of his home and the first few steps of his home, which was a quarter mile past the tavern. He didn't see her. Suddenly, he felt his face burn. He turned around and started to run, but she caught him by the shirt collar before he could catch up.</p> <p>"Don't be like that! You were so good!" she exclaimed looking at him with her eyes wide and her lips curling up into a malicious smile, "you're gorgeous!" She smiled while kissing him again.</p> <p>His brain spun with the alcohol and he pulled back. His palms were sweating and he had a hard time standing straight. A small smile crossed her lips and she squeezed his hand lightly.</p> <p>"You are very nice," she said while kissing him again and giving his elbow a tender squeeze. He felt her lips curl upwards to his ear, "and I think I might have found the right size to suit you," she breathed as she pulled him towards her. She pressed herself to him and felt herself rubbing against him even more, "you must like me."</p> <p>She squeezed him again and felt him respond. She kissed him even harder and she felt his excitement increase. She pressed him up against the wall and pulled his clothes off. With his cock hard and throbbing between their bodies, she undid his jeans and unzipped them. Still hugging each other, she pulled him until he was standing at the edge of the room, which had a sofa, a chair and a couple of bean chairs. He could feel her heat emanating from her body as she sat on the sofa and pulled him closer to her.</p> <p>"I don't mind you liking me," she whispered as she unbuttoned her shirt. Without any further delay, she pulled his hands to her breasts and started to rub them. He pushed her tits together and slid them over his head. He could smell the delicate odor of her perfume and his cock pressed against her. He reached his fingers into her bra and caressed her nipples. She moaned in his ear. He felt his cock rise in the thin dress he had and he felt the moist warmness of her. His cock hardened even more and he pushed against her. She felt it throb against her and squeezed it even more.</p> <p>His hands found her skirt. He felt her skin even though it was a bit damp and he wondered what it would look like. Her legs parted astride his hips as he rubbed her, and he felt her panties slide inside her. He slipped his hands under the strap and his fingers stroked her inner thigh.</p> <p>She moaned again. He turned her body around. He kissed her, pressing against her as he pressed his erection against her. He reached around and lifted her legs. They were parted as he bent and touched her with his hands. They were very warm and the sound of his touch filled the room and the feel of her nakedness, his fingers caressing her.</p> <p>His touch made her whimper a little. Her skin had goose bumps and she ran her fingers along his. His fingers felt so smooth and soft and he moved his hand lower onto the inside of her thigh. She trembled and squirmed against him.</p> <p>She felt him slip his left hand inside her panties, moving it against her wetness. She felt so naked and so exposed. It was all so forbidden and yet he didn't care about anything at all about the night. They were a sexual experience but not something that happened in the past. She felt his fingers probe inside her wetness and rub against her flesh with him. She shuddered and felt herself drip with her excitement.</p> <p>Still kissing her, he lifted her legs and slowly pushed his erection against her. His cock felt so hard against hers and she felt as if they were joined at the hip while their bodies fit together. He stroked his hardness against her and she moaned and groaned while he continued to press against her in an effortless rhythm. He could feel the tight satin of her muscles which seemed to envelope his swollen prick as her, as if not just pressing against his erection. He would tighten around him and was like his whole body. She would tighten with his throbbing his hips he too, soâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
