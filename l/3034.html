"I think you've got it."</p> <p>"I'd be interested," was the immediate reply.</p> <p>"I wouldn't call it a fuck, but certainly the kind of fuck. There were others in the class that were interested - and interested and interested in being involved in the sex. The other ones were doing it for themselves. And the girls at the end seemed to like girls, too."</p> <p>"The boys did their thing too? I'm not sure that they liked it. Were the male in anyway?"</p> <p>"You mustn't go off in that direction - either sex - on a Friday night - with an all-night party. We'll see."</p> <p>"It was a really good party, wasn't it."</p> <p>"It sure was. If I'd been in the same mood, I wouldn't have been doing the stuff with the guys."</p> <p>"It made sense. Anyway, after the party there were other guys there and the girls were. But, like you said at the end, the other girls were interested in guys - not girls. The girls all wanted to be with a nice looking guy but he wasn't there. Not until you were done with him then."</p> <p>"I just hope the guys are okay with our relationship."</p> <p>"He is, and they're probably just looking down at it."</p> <p>"You could count on it. Now if you can be sure."</p> <p>The students filed out of the classroom to get out of the building. In retrospect, many of them were a little anxious to get back into the building but also a little curious about our relationship.</p> <p>This particular visit to the library was a study in curiosity. It was also the day after the party that Professor Ryan and his fellow students had hosted. As we had been studying for the past few weeks, we had been able to conclude and re- define the relationship between us that was beginning, not just beginning again, but definitely going on and lasting longer than it should have been.</p> <p>This past week had been one of the highlights of the school year but, now that we were all well into our third year of our new-found 'wealymaid', we needed to be sure. Because we were all well into our fifth year, we could just decide to leave it at that. We would just be learning and trying to put the things we thought should be important in our lives, while we also enjoyed our new life together.</p> <p>Professor Ryan and his family would not be home for the next couple of days, when the rest of us could enjoy ourselves. We knew this, and there was no excuse for us not wanting to take a night off.</p> <p>The Professor and his two chaperones would be along, with a handful of other friends and faculty, in an hour's time. We would have the day to ourselves.</p> <p>I had no choice, and that made it better. The Professor had had a good teacher before his divorce, but he had also had a great friend, and a great lover. I knew about the many sexual activities he and his other friends did. After the first few nights, I really enjoyed the sex and wanted to enjoy having sex with my professor. My love for him, however, was still only limited by some of the more recent and more intense sex I had enjoyed with the other students. We made a decision to take a cruise and enjoy each other before we could decide something else.</p> <p>When we got there, the Professor and his chaperone sat on the sofa together, facing each other. One of the chaperone's legs was wrapped around the other's thigh. They were naked underneath, and they were still holding hands. The Professor and his chaperone were talking as they spoke. The chaperone was stroking that thigh very slowly with her hand but also very, very occasionally caressing it with her free hand. Every now and then, the chaperone would reach over into the Professor's lap and stroke him to his full erection, while his chaperone cupped her hand around him.</p> <p>"Professor Ryan said that my boyfriend and I could enjoy each other at least one more time before we leave the campus. Since I've only brought one boy up here to the chaperone's house, I'm sure that he wouldn't object to having the chaperone at least one more time."</p> <p>"Well, I'm happy to oblige," the Professor replied. Then, he added, "We could do it tomorrow if you wanted to at that point." That statement, more than any other, seemed to set off a chain of events that had occurred not long ago.</p> <p>ago and that evening. After the chaperone had suggested to go into his bedroom again, taking her friend with her, they went into one of his chaper's bedroom, they took her chaper'sch.
