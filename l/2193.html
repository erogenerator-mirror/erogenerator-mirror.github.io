Whatsoever doth happen in the ordinary course and consequence of</h4><p><strong>natural events, neither the Gods, (for it is not possible, that they either wittingly or unwittingly should do anything amiss) nor men, (for it is through ignorance, and therefore against</strong> Nature, that, even for the mortal man, the Gods may still claim him); yet, allowing him the ultimate joy and joys, all that was achieved with only the purest and most natural of human pleasures, yet, even though the Gods claim him with the greatest of adornment, yet, still, still, still, still, he is still in Hell, and she is still in Hell.</p> <p>She wanted to make him orgasm more by sucking his cock. She wanted to make him ejaculate more by sucking his cock. She wanted to make him ejaculate even more by licking his cum off the very tip of his cock, and she wanted to make him cum in her mouth again and again.</p> <p>She wanted him to fuck her again, or, even better, when he was ready to do it. She wanted to watch him fuck her again, and as she watched him fuck her, as she watched him fuck her, she wanted to see if he was able to make her cum. She wanted to see if he'd cum after fucking her.</p> <p>They had sex often, in many ways, but just once.</p> <p>On many occasions, for instance, when he was fucking her good and hard, she sucked him at the end of sex, but before that, during their fuck, he sucked her, or was she sucking him, while she held his cock, or was he sucking her tits.</p> <p>Then, when she came, she sucked him, she was sucking him, she was sucking him, in some combinations; she was sucking him with his cock in her mouth, or did he suck her with his cock in her mouth.</p> <p>But, once again, on many occasions, he climaxed when she sucked him.</p> <p>She had sucked him all too well, and he had to make her suck him again.</p> <p>When they fucked often, she took him to bed.</p> <p>But this time they fucked on those times.</p> <p>She was not wearing any clothes. She was naked.</p> <p>He was naked.</p> <p>She got out of bed and put on some stockings and heels and came out all wet, as they were, then, after she got dressed, she went to take them off him.</p> <p>They lay there, in the bed, and he was on top of her. She was his fuck-bunny, she was his fuck-bunny.</p> <p>"Oh, Jason, I love you," she said as she wrapped her legs around him and hugged and hugged him and kissed him.</p> <p>He was kissing her back, and kissing her back.</p> <p>"I love you too, too," he said into her hair.</p> <p>He made love with her.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes. Now, on your stomach," he said.</p> <p>She did it.</p> <p>She had to roll over.</p> <p>"Roll over," he said.</p> <p>"Roll over," she said.</p> <p>"Roll over. Roll over," he said.</p> <p>That was her "Roll".</p> <p>She got on her back, and lay back.</p> <p>"Roll!" he said.</p> <p>He rolled her onto her stomach.</p> <p>He kissed her back with the most open mouth that he'd ever kissed her.</p> <p>"Roll! Roll!" he said.</p> <p>She rolled.</p> <p>"Roll!" he said.</p> <p>He lifted her ass in the air.</p> <p>"Roll! Roll! Roll!" he said.</p> <p>He lifted her.</p> <p>"Roll!" he said.</p> <p>He lifted her.</p> <p>"Roll!"</p> <p>He lifted her, and she rolled.</p> <p>"Roll!"</p> <p>He rolled her again.</p> <p>"Roll! Roll!"</p> <p>He rolled her and rolled.</p> <p>"Roll!"</p> <p>He rolled.</p> <p>"Roll!"</p> <p>"Roll!"</p> <p>"Roll!"</p> <p>"Roll!"</p> <p>He rolled.</p> <p>"Roll! Roll!"</p> <p>He rolled again.</p> <p>"Roll!
