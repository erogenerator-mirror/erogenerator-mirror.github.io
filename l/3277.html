English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LXXV. SCIENCE.</h4><p><strong>Thus sang the magician; and all who were present went like birds unawares into the net of his artful and melancholy voluptuousness. Only the spiritually conscientious one had not been</strong> satisfied. And thus the writer had made up his minds, and the reader had decided to make a decision. What would it be to make his most powerful words come forth, and that could be taken as a sign of a great triumph?</p> <p>He had a large and comfortable chair and a large table so that he could watch and read if needed. Yet here was a man who had always been in love with his own book. Yes, in spite of himself. But now that he was here, he knew that love could not last forever; he knew that the time was near as he was still very young, and that it was important not to waste even then the greatest gift.</p> <p>"And my special teacher has made a great discovery, but he has no experience with this, nor even those that are in the industry."</p> <p>As this was a great point in his story, "I see you have something," the wise man said nodding his head towards the empty chair in front of his desk. As the woman looked at him over the top of his desk, he had a feeling she was a little disappointed that he had not been able to help her as he used the technique of the artist that he had been born with and he had read many of his previous work.</p> <p>"The teacher has written a new book to be published in the year after next, and he has requested, in response to some of my suggestions that he was asked by a female student to create some music about the teacher's wife. And you have found this to be quite interesting," he paused to give a hint which, for him at least, had an erotic connotation: as if he had just discovered the mystery about his own writing and had discovered the possibility of a book.</p> <p>"I do have a special request for you," the sexy teacher continued before he had a chance to respond a little hesitantly. "I would appreciate you to provide me with my musical talent to give to my husband. When I heard he had written his last book he asked one of his colleagues to write a song about the teacher's wife."</p> <p>She had turned away from him as he spoke but now, as he looked around his desk and saw her bending over slightly to look at a photo that seemed to be of the teacher and her friend standing together with the artist in a traditional pose - her friend was topless, and it was her who used the piano piece on the music to play the song. She had an incredibly pretty look and a look of pleasure running through his body. This was all a bit of the same thing. If he had been a guy he would have looked over at her chest, while his own shirt showed signs of his lustful desire and he was sure that his mouth had gone dry.</p> <p>She turned around to look at him again, and smiled broadly. The teacher had just said that the song wasn't really an artist's song, and she was an artist, he now realized. But it was still fun enough to be his own "special" muse, and it was important to be his teacher to be able to make his own music; it was all about the way the student and teacher would be able to make music together.</p> <p>The teacher's smile melted with approval as her hand rose out of the chair and she ran it over the front of his thigh. He felt himself stirring yet again and he had been unable to stop himself from looking forward to what might be coming. He looked down at his own pants, which was still quite uncomfortable with his engorged cock being seen not too far from his teacher.</p> <p>She pushed back slightly on the desk and he felt that familiar sensation of pushing his cock against his pants. With some slight pressure the tip was at the end of his fly, now pressing just above where his boxers were pressed in, and he could feel the fabric of his boxer briefs.</p> <p>The hand that had been massaging his cock now dropped to his crotch. His cock was growing as the woman smiled at him as she unzipped his trousers. The soft silk felt wonderful against his flesh, and the way she touched his cock was causing a desire so strong that he could feel it through his body. And now she was touching him.</p> <p>She pulled his trousers and underwear off with his pants, and with his dick in her hand he felt as if he had a light and very warm blanket. The touch of her hand, and the feel of her fingers on his cock almost sent an unexpected orgasm through him, and for once he felt his excitement rising steadily.</p> <p>She pushed his boxers down, and as she stood up he could see that her breasts were bare and hard. And so were her nipples, and her breasts were so very soft and to have been touched by a woman so very much. She was her, they must be hard and all of the soft and, and, he told her even at the artist. He felt her whole body of her with soâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
