English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XXIII. THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR.</h4><p><strong>After this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a sower who hath scattered his seed. His soul,</strong> and the mind, of whom he was not man, had become his mate, for the rest of his days.</p> <p>He was already planning some sort of celebration, in hopes that he would have a chance of getting out of this mountain without running the risk of running into one of his pursuers. He planned to take another day's walk at least.</p> <p>The cave was well lit up with small torches of light as the camp was packed into the distance. And the small light created a pleasant atmosphere for Zarathustra.</p> <p>He decided to go for a walk on one of the rocks. He could feel his body react to the air as he walked; his manhood became erect with anticipation.</p> <p>Just before sunset, the camp emptied into a small clearing on a small cliff which was surrounded by a small lake, which is an ideal place for camping. It was a perfect place to set up a camp in the daytime, a perfect place to meet his lover, to fuck in the sun, and to watch his beautiful woman being bred from behind. For days the camp was filled with its own little campfire before nightfall.</p> <p>Zarathustra's mind wandered as he walked along the rocks and rocks of the cliff. He was already hard. But he had no desire for any particular type of sex. And he had to leave today for a couple of hours since his work shift.</p> <p>What he wanted to do the most would be to have sex with his lover once more. And then to return to his warm home without any need to feel ashamed about being naked in his bed and his wife again.</p> <p>He found a large stone tree in the clearing, and laid down on the log in the grass. The moss on the forest floor had gotten rather warm, but he lay naked in the grass, feeling the sun warm his skin. His erection became erect at the thought of having sex with his lover with her.</p> <p>But he decided to rest and then make himself comfortable for a walk on the next day.</p> <p>For hours he lay naked in his grass, dreaming his lover was fucking him in the afternoon. She had just been asleep. And now it was dawn. He had to make good use of his power to prepare for morning, and he would not be able to have sex for another two nights.</p> <p>His hand roamed slowly down his body, pausing at his hard member and teasing his balls.</p> <p>He was still naked. But, as usual, he enjoyed his body naked. And that turned into some kind of pleasure when he was naked, just his body and his mind, aching with the memory of his lover.</p> <p>She had been so kind to him. In fact, she had been the one to teach him the ways to please his manliness. The way his body should be in order to please a woman.</p> <p>And from her gentle tutoring he had learned quite a good amount in that womanhood.</p> <p>As he felt his erection get so hard at thinking about her. There was only one way to start in his mind so that he would know what to do.</p> <p>And so he lay naked in the grass, his mind still trying to recall the time at which they had begun their sexual affair.</p> <p>She had felt so good when he had been so insistent. He had looked so good in his underwear as he had pulled her naked, her breasts bouncing freely in his hands as he had made love to her. But she had only felt good by having him. She hadn't felt much pleasure.</p> <p>He had thought he had made her orgasm while they fucked, but she had simply felt so different. She felt so sensual in his arms as she held him close to her and kissed the top of his head, his cheeks and his neck. And yet he had been unable to stop himself from looking into her eyes and holding her close as he had fucked her.</p> <p>When his love had felt at ease, her lover had come back to his thoughts of how his body should be pleasing a woman. And he had been afraid that if he didn't, that his pleasure could be less than that of his own.</p> <p>When he had watched his lover having sex with her as he wanted, he'd have loved the look on Zarathustra's face, and he had wished that he had been able to feel that for a woman.</p> <p>And she had been right. He thought that she had been wonderful.</p> <p>She had felt the same. He had wanted to be with her, and now he would have to make love to her instead of waiting a day before he had sex with her lover.</p> <p>And now here he lay naked beside her. He could feel his erection throbbing as he looked on her. which had started to him. his manliness again. He could feel the warmth it. He smiled and when he felt his manly. he wanted the lust, in his manlinessâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
