The Pulpit.</h4><p><strong>I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing</strong> back to the screen showed an image of a beautiful lady in a simple black dress:</p> <p>"Oh my dear, where did you get this?" A lady dressed in a strapless gown, wearing a long white gown and a red and burgundy gown, with a pair of white boots, a knee length white coat and of course an open bodied bodice with a thin golden chain.</p> <p>"She wore you for one of your lectures, Sir," the gentleman replied and proceeded to place the lady's dress in her purse.</p> <p>"I'm very fond of these, Mrs. K. They are exquisite," the gentleman said and placed his hands upon Mrs. K. K's hips, and proceeded up to her breasts, and placed the Lady's hands upon the gentleman's shoulders; she opened the bodice to reveal her body to them and began to unzip his tunic.</p> <p>"Oh, Sir, I'm afraid I'm not dressed to suit you in this attire, Sir," the lady said as she pulled the gentlemen's tunic from his arms and gently pulled the gown up over his body and off.</p> <p>"Well, you could just wear this," the gentleman said and removed one of her dress' long sleeves; she had not a clue at what to call it;</p> <p>"No, it's too formal," she replied, "Let me change my dress and I'll go change into it."</p> <p>"Here, come with me," the gentleman said as he took her hand and helped her out of the dress and laid down to change.</p> <p>"I am glad you like me, Sir," she said as she came to him, and pulled the dress on herself.</p> <p>"You look rather beautiful," the gentleman complimented her and complimented her body as he pulled her in a passionate embrace. "My mother was very pleased with you, this lovely young lady." That was the word 'beautiful'; she thought.</p> <p>The gentleman continued talking while Mrs. K. K removed her clothing and sat astride and removed his. She then undressed him, her dress hanging just off of her shoulders, and he continued undressing her slowly. He placed his hands upon her bare shoulders and began to kiss her breasts while caressing her waist; he moved his hands to hold her legs apart but never ventured near her private parts.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't need any perfume or oil," the gentleman said, "It's the woman you need.</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir."</p> <p>The gentleman looked at Mrs. K. K, and had a look of confusion about himself in her eyes, "May I kiss you then, Mrs. K?"</p> <p>"Certainly, yes," she said, "Let's do it, shall we?"</p> <p>Their lips met and she felt his tongue begin to caress hers; he gently sucked upon it and her body began to quiver</p> <p>"Oh, God you feel so good, it is wonderful," he said.</p> <p>"Please, Sir, kiss me more," she said, "Your lips feel so good."</p> <p>She felt him open his mouth just a bit and then she felt his tongue begin to caress her inner thigh. She felt his hand slide up and begin to caress and squeeze her breasts and she moaned with pleasure; he continued his passionate advances downward as he gently explored her thighs, to eventually his hand began to rub his way to her mound. She could not stop her body from trembling from the gentle touches from the gentleman; she was now a lust filled woman; she could not hold back her desire.</p> <p>She moaned again, "Oh, no, Sir, please, let me..."</p> <p>As the gentleman continued to caress her with his hand, Mrs. K undid his shirt which fell down but she had not yet undressed him. She undid his belt and his trousers followed by his underpants. His body is very attractive, she thought to herself, and as her hands touched his thighs, he parted them, and she felt the hardness of his shaft. He continued caressing her thighs with his fingers. She could feel his hardness becoming hot against her pussy lips, she knew what was about to happen, she had never been so happy, so aroused.</p> <p>"My pussy is so wet, Sir, please, let me come."</p> <p>"I don't mean just yet," he said.</p> <p>In one rapid motion, the gentleman lifted himself off of her and laid out between her legs. Mrs. K. K began to feel him between her legs; she began to rub the penis on her clitoris and felt herself coming. As he started to insert his penis into her vaginal passage, the penis into her vagina, she began to rub its warmth and felt his hardness. She moaned with excitement.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh, Sir, Sir, it's it's so good, you are too is good itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
