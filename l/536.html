Even though he wanted to continue with, even as he was writing the letter to Edward, who wouldn’t? He couldn’t! He had to leave, he had to go back to his study. He wanted to go home, leave the books behind and read them.</p> <p>He had to go back, he had to come to his study! He had to go back home. He wanted to leave, he had to leave!</p> <p>***</p> <p>The two men stood beside Michael’s desk, Michael leaning heavily against the wooden top. His eyes were fixed on his secretary as he turned to place his hands on the chair’s arm rests. From the corner of his eye he saw the older man’s eyes move over her. He watched as the dark red flush crept across Jennifer’s pale skin. It crept back up to her eyes before running down to the crevice of her breasts. The fingers she’d placed on each one tightened for a moment, but then went back to her fingers. They were still there and he could see the pinkness of them through the lace.</p> <p>“What about those for me…” The husky voice came from behind.</p> <p>Michael's heart pounded and he couldn’t hear what the other man was saying. He watched as the first man reached across the desk, took hold of her hands and shook them away. Jennifer looked back at him, her eyes narrowed in anger, her lips curled in a little smile.</p> <p>Michael looked at her, at her body, at the woman’s body in front of him. His eyes followed her curves, over her rounded shoulders and down her arms, across the full swell of her breasts. He stared at them, not quite seeing what she was doing, because of the light.</p> <p>Behind her, Michael could feel his penis swelling in his pants as Jennifer’s skin began to flush. He looked back at the second man shaking her hands away, watching her body shift under his gaze.</p> <p>The man knelt in front of her, taking her wrists in his hands, and bringing her arms up over her head. Michael saw, as she struggled, his hands slip under her arms and lift her, lifting her from the chair's edge.</p> <p>Jennifer leaned forward, resting her hands against the armrest. The man lifted her again until she was practically horizontal. Then he pulled her arms behind her back with one hand and grabbed a hold of her hair with the other. Michael closed his eyes, trying to concentrate on his writing. He leaned back, waiting for her to open her mouth and take his cock in her. She gave it no resistance. Michael’s hands moved over her breasts, one cupping his middle finger around the hard nub of her erect nipple. The man began to twist it between his finger. Jennifer’s head went back in the chair, her hair falling over her face. Her eyes closed, her head lolled and her mouth opened and closed with each breath.</p> <p>Michael’s hands moved to her ass, gripping the smooth skin there. He pulled her towards him, moving her body closer. His lips found hers and they kissed. First it was a short, gentle peck on the lips and then a deeper, longer kiss that ended in Jennifer pulling him toward her with her arms. Michael’s tongue slipped out between his teeth, tasting her mouth, moving against the warm insides.</p> <p>Jennifer’s arms went around Michael’s neck, her fingers brushing against his skin as they shared their first kiss. She reached up, one arm around his neck and the other resting around his waist. The kiss began to deepen and Michael knew he shouldn’t do it, but he couldn’t. He didn’t want Jennifer to stop him, he didn’t know that. He broke the kiss and his hands went to her waist, sliding over her rounded butt.</p> <p>Jennifer’s hand slid down over his chest, finding his cock and stroking it through his trousers. She gave it a quick flick of her hand, moving her leg away to let him free and she stood before him, pushing aside her black dress and letting him stand next to her as she pulled her skirt up. The skirt bunched high on her thighs, her legs parted so Michael could see her naked pussy. With the other hand she gripped his erection, pulling his pants down so he couldn't help himself.</p> <p>As Michael’s hands moved over her butt. He could feel his cock straining its way under her thigh under his pants. He wanted to have her, to run his mouth over her body with his tongue, to feel her lips and inside her as fast as she came to him. But somehow he couldn’d always have her.
