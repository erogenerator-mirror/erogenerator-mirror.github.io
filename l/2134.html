Ever to represent unto thyself; and to set before thee, both the</h4><p><strong>general age and time of the world, and the whole substance of it. And how all things particular in respect of these are for their substance, as one of the</strong> things the Bible says. (I was only twenty when it came to sex; and that meant so many things.) But it's all there, with all that comes to mind - there is something about having sex in that moment, just in the way the moon lights come out like they did just one more second along with its stars. Or maybe that's the whole thing all it was about was sex.</p> <p>In any event, the next thing I did was with my lover. That was all it took. We both climaxed at the same time, me in the dark for a minute or two, with both of us on top at the same time – and I came and came and came, and we both came and came, and we both came, one by one, and we both came, our bodies and minds and bodies and minds all going crazy and it was the greatest thing I ever felt.</p> <p>It was definitely our greatest first time together – it was like the best night in the whole of the world. It was like an incredible rush of emotion, like being on the moon, and you felt like a star, for the first time in your entire existence, feeling like a person on the moon. Or something like that. I don't know who made the decision to do that, but it just happened. We kissed, kissed some more, and I sucked on her nipples and squeezed her breast, her pussy juice on her thighs, her pussy juice, our lips, and everything became moist, wet, and shiny. We kissed some more, and it was beautiful.</p> <p>But now it was time to change. I took my lips away from her lips and her nipples and moved down her body to taste those luscious lips and her sweet pussy cream again.</p> <p>I kissed her mouth. Her lips were soft and hot, and her lips a little moist, and they tasted of sex, and their wetness made her lips even smoother. As I kissed and sucked on hers she was making soft mewing noises and I moved my lips down to her sweet belly-button, her breasts, her belly, her navel. As I kissed there I went down further and down to what was the first of her sexual flavors of her pussy juice that she had ever tasted. I went down further and lower and to what I knew of her womanhood after its pussy had become so wet from our kissing, her pussy lips. I could see her vagina – it was moist, pink, glistening. It didn't hide anything, and I knew in my heart that I had to taste it. And she needed the taste of her virgin pussy – my tongue.</p> <p>She raised her feet and I lifted her so she was sitting on the sofa again, and I stood there leaning down onto her. Her breasts were still shining and they swayed gently while she moved them gently along the inside of me. Her nipples were erect, and they were bigger than they'd been, and she was so moist and beautiful and hot.</p> <p>And in no time at all, she came, and I felt her pussy pulsing on my tongue again.</p> <p>I was still standing, but I reached to put my still hard cock in her mouth, which she licked eagerly and sucked as her tongue played with my knob. As I did the same, her hand found my cock and moved along it in all its glory, and the same rhythm her tongue danced, stroked the knob, her hand squeezed it so it was hard and throbbing as she sucked me and licked me and let me suck her face and face and mouth.</p> <p>For several minutes there was a moment or two when she could barely breathe. She stopped moving her mouth and just sighed. She pulled my dick from her mouth – I had been so hard, so eager, all this time. It was still throbbing inside her mouth and she looked at that face with longing – and she kissed it again and again and again, her soft lips and wet tongue caressing it in all different ways.</p> <p>Then she stood up again, and I lay down on her back. She straddled my lap and we kissed again, passionately. She took my hands and pulled me up to her mouth again. As my cock came into contact with her wet lips, they stretched them out and let it slip into her mouth. It felt so nice – it was almost as though I was inside her. She had swallowed it all of the way in, like a child letting me lick his mother's face, for all she could do was gasp and sigh and moan, until my hard cock was half the way in and she could take no more. I kissed her back and her lips again, and I could feel their wet warmth on my cock.</p> <p></p> <p>cock, in her vagina. I could smell her wet vagina, her wet and a taste of love, of a cunt and was like a sweet, of her vagina. I, of the whole world in her sex.
