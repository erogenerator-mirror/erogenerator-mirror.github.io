POIROT EXPLAINS</h4><p><strong>“Poirot, you old villain,” I said, “I’ve half a mind to strangle you! What do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?” We were sitting in the library.</strong> I was still in my blue boxers from yesterday and my cock still stuck up when I leaned my head back. I took it out and was hard, but not quite hard, but still, there’s a problem! I didn’t even have my robe on and the thought of just fucking my sister’s body, when I knew that wasn’t possible. We had the only reason I’d be naked, to use one of my hands under my robe.</p> <p>She looked at me with surprise. She had no clothes to begin with, she was just going to go and shower! But, that’s what she did. She pulled off her robe, and got up into the hallway. It took a bit of a while to follow her, but, since I knew where she put something, I did. I was ready to give it up but I remembered, if I did well, I could be right about her.</p> <p>“Oh dear...I wasn’t sure you could,” she said, as she came down the stairs.</p> <p>“Are you coming in?” I asked. She stood next to the couch where she had been, her naked body glistening with water. We had a few glasses of wine and some toast on the small table. We sat down together on either side of the old coffee table and we chatted for a while about the weekend. She told me she was going to shower and get ready for the day. The hot water had a lovely effect on me. I said, a little tentatively, “I don’t know why I’m not hard as a rock but this morning has been amazing. So I had no problem going down to my room to have a wank.” She got up and was standing in front of the fire. She was still wearing her boxers, but they really looked good on her. I noticed the dark shadow of her nipples and her pussy lips. She had on an old, tattered white, t-shirt. I got a bit excited as I drank in the sight of her legs and her lovely bum. She took down the shirt to reveal her naked breasts as she reached around herself with her hands to playfully pinch her nipples. She took a step away from me so I could see her pussy so I could see those lovely tits. Then, the look of concentration on her face changed and I watched as she took off her panties, kicked them off, and dropped them on the floor. My cock was rock and hard and I could feel my pre cum oozing out of the tip of me.</p> <p>She didn’t say what she did next. Her nipples hardened. “Don’t say no.” They were big dark nubs of stiff pink flesh on a lovely, milky and creamy surface. Like her beautiful nipples, her pussy hair was a deep dark brown. “I’ve got an idea.” She dropped her boxers onto the floor and hopped in the middle of the old couch and bent forward at the waist to take one of my stiff erections into her mouth.</p> <p>She looked me in the eye and said, “Mmmm, that feels so good! If you like, I can sit like this,” and she reached one hand down to feel my balls. She began to fondle them again, stroking the long shaft and then rubbing my tip with her thumb just where she knew it would feel most pleasurable. I moaned. She continued to do this for a while, squeezing my pole firmly. Then, she took off her T-shirt. She seemed to be in a hurry. Her tits fell out of her bra and it seemed that she was unhooking it. She was still bent backwards at the waist, but her legs were open again and she now had just a pair of dark blue panties on. I could see how she had the skin on her stomach on her pussy right above her ass crack. I was on the verge of pulling down my shorts and taking off my trousers when I heard a noise from across the room.</p> <p>“Oooooooh,” she exclaimed as she stood up from the couch, “I forgot to tell you about the noise.”</p> <p>I looked over and saw that she had taken off her panties too. She was squatting down between her legs. I felt my cock begin to stiffen. She looked up at me with a small smile on her face. She took my cock in her hand and began to stroke me slowly as she reached up and down the shaft and took my balls. my head slipped into her mouth. My cock slid in then out again, down her mouth with my balls. her tongue. She moans. Then, she sucked it with her tongue. I felt her lips. Then again on my cock with her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
