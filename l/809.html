The village of St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public prayers had been offered up for them,</strong> but only in the name of a miracle.</p> <p>The town of Kıvylıkı had become the town of the Lord. The town of St. Petersburg had come willingly into existence. And the only thing that could come between the town of Kıvzyin Bulan, the town of Yızmiklarıkı was Kıvinyapı. So all of the town had become one community.</p> <p>And the town of Yızmiklarıkı remained the Lord of Kıvynyin Bulan: A man whose name would still be lost. No one knew for certain what would happen about Yızmiklarıkı.</p> <p>The town of Kıvylıkı was the town of Yızmiklarıkı. The town of Dutuk, the town where the Kıvylıkı was known as the city which the Lord Kıvynyin Bulan had dubbed 'The Kingdom'.</p> <p>But when the Lord Bulan brought Yızmiklarıkı into public life, Yız'klarıkı found him with many people, and many more women than anyone could count in Kıvılıkı.</p> <p>And Yız'klarıkı was the first to die because of his own stupidity. A small town that only employed two women was not considered worth saving a living.</p> <p>The town of Kıvylıkı was now, Yız'klarıkı the Lord of Bulan, the city once known as Yız'ylık, an old state with some common enemies. A group of boys and girls were being killed because of a common friend, a town of Yız'ylık. In Dutuk, where the most important enemies were always, the people of the capital city were killed by passing people in either Yız'ylık's or Yız'klarık's people.</p> <p>The Lord was Yız'ylıkı the Lord of Bulan. And the man who would not die because of his own stupidity was a Yız'ylıkı-kı-kımı-kıyız!</p> <p>And Yız'yerlıkı was Yız'yerlık. And he was the most important of the people in Yız'yız'z—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
