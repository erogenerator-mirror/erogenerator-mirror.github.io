I am not, in that I am ordained for the sake of the Divine, but also, for the sake of having the Divine in my service.</p> <p>It is, therefore, humbly humbly humbly humbly humbly humbly humbly humselfie, to signify the name of the Divine to the point that the Divine knows of it being granted the name, and a prayer, which he has given, and bequeathed a prayer of all of the names and functions of the Divine to bless him; I vow to have the name signed, for all the names and services known, and bequeathed.</p> <p>In my book of the Divine, though a person is already blessed to be married and to be married; So that's my blessing to have been blessed and bequeathed. And for that I may be blessed with the name of the Divine in my service.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>It's an experience that I have never had one that I'm sure that I'd like to share with all my friends and relatives.</p> <p>I was a student—as any student would be—at the University of Massachusetts. In any case, I had a reputation in high school. While not exactly a rebel, and certainly not necessarily, I was not a hypocrite and I did my best to keep a low profile with my new boyfriend, Mike.</p> <p>I met Mike one night in the middle of a party. Our relationship was casual and I went out to get what I wanted. I was wearing a short skirt, a thin and tight fitting black one-piece dress that showed not my skin but my long, beautiful legs and a set of sexy black high heels. I was wearing heels and my hair up, but I didn't care. That night was all about my lover Mike.</p> <p>Mike and I were on a night stand, he had a long, thick, black cock in his hand and he was stroking it like mad. We were in a corner and we were kissing as we were fondling each other's breasts and kissing our mouths and touching ourselves everywhere—and then we were making love. Our lovemaking was a wonderful, loving thing. Mike took me like an experienced lover and then he fucked me good.</p> <p>I came. When Mike fucked me I came and came. When we went to sleep I came and came again and again and again. And it was a good feeling. I loved sex.</p> <p>We went out to dinner that night and then we went to his apartment, where we did our evening and he got laid. We ate dinner, had drinks, and then went on the street to watch some movie.</p> <p>Mike and I watched the movie that we didn't even have any money for. So we watched it together and we watched it as much as we watched the movie, because the movie was all about love. I loved it. I fell in love with Mike that night and that night, and I loved him just as much as him.</p> <p>Mike and I fucked that night. This time was different. This time, when we watched the movie that we were both so happy to be watching, so we were happy to be fucking each other. And because we were fucking, it was our night to enjoy the rest of the evening while we enjoyed each other's bodies and their love and their passion.</p> <p>The End—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
