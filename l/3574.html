She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and she had now therefore nothing</strong> to show for it. In her own way, Mrs. Jennings was a woman of God. A real man. A real mother.</p> <p>The last time she had fucked was that same night, when she had fucked another man. That same person!</p> <p>It had not taken long to find him. They had met at the mall, and started making out before his arrival. His wife and children were around, and they were at their dinner, playing some games, then he had taken her upstairs to his room. The night was warm and steamy, and they were naked in his bed, kissing as they made out. The rest of the night was a blur. They had fucked and sucked and caressed each other's body in every room of his house until they passed out of exhaustion.</p> <p>Mrs. Jennings, too, was an old widow. She never had much money, and the last thing she needed was money for just one night. She needed to be a widow for a change, and she needed to look the part.</p> <p>Her new husband had fucked her. She had loved him. She had been married to him for a few weeks while he was in college, then she got pregnant and became an aunt. Then, when his new marriage was over, he had fucked her again until she begged him to stop and asked to leave. He had fucked her five times before he came home one day.</p> <p>As Mrs. Jennings lay on her back in the middle of his bed with his eyes closed, waiting, she knew she had to have him. She had to have everything inside her. She needed a different kind of cock, or at least a different kind of cock, no matter how old and fat it was. She didn't need to look at herself in the mirror. She wasn't a widow any more. She needed a man.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Mrs. Wills was looking at herself in the mirror and smiling to herself in turn. The little skirt she was wearing was only two steps to the floor, and when she stood there, the skirt flared so sexily, it looked like silk in the sunlight. This was how a forty-something woman should do it: strip, bend over her bed, and present her ass, pussy, and asshole for whatever he felt like doing to her. She put her hands on her hips and began to turn slowly as her hands shook and pulled at the thin hem of her uniform.</p> <p>When she turned around to face that mirror, she could almost see a part of him: the outline of his cock was clear and hard in his pants, and it was poking out of his zipper. She took a step forward, letting her breasts hang down toward the mirror, and held up the hem as her breasts bounced free from her shirt. She reached up and pushed them together roughly, then let the fabric slide down her arms. "Oops," she muttered to herself, a little too quiet, "not so sexy."</p> <p>Now standing in her own bedroom, she could make out the outlines of his eyes and cheekbones in the bright light of the bathroom mirror, but it felt like a second skin to her. She took a step closer: "I can't see you," she whispered breathlessly. "I can't see you."</p> <p>It took him a moment to see, but he did. A half-strangled, half-shriek came from his mouth, and his cock jerked as he tried to move. "You're married," Mrs. Jennings told herself. "You're married to someone. I can't believe I did that." "Don't you think a man's gotta wait," she responded, "but don't worry." She reached into her nightstand drawer, pulling out a small digital camera, a digital flash, and some soft color film. She opened the camera and showed him the flash, then the pictures, then showed him the pictures she had taken of herself. While he was examining the pictures, she looked at herself in the mirror, smiling, and started humming to herself. "Why have this old widow had sex with me?"</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"That was naughty, wasn't it?" Mrs. Wills thought that he should do something, anything. But then again, what man doesn't want to be found attractive in a mirror? Especially when a woman is as sexy as her. The fact this was his own wife, and she was wearing such a revealing uniform without any clothes was one of the few things he couldn't control. "Maybe my husband won't want to do anything, but I guess this is only the beginning." As Mrs. Jennings left the bedroom, she turned and opened his bedroom door. In the mirror, she observed the man's reflection, saw him naked glory stretched out, his face, and eyes. His penis. What she saw the full breasts, naked and breasts and penis.
