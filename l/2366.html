Frank Baum </h3><h4>18. Away to the South</h4><p><strong>Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up</strong> there herself or she would have regretted it very much.</p> <p>She had a good sense of humor and didn't feel it made any difference that she had the job she could do it and that she was going to have one. It seemed that everyone had done that since elementary school, but the world had changed. Dorothy was never going back home to the world.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Lying in front of the roaring fire in the small cozy bedroom, Dorothy could not believe that she was in Kansas again, a hundred years after that day, a year she could never have imagined. And if something like that had ever happened to her, the only reason would have been her old schoolmates on the school's cheer squad.</p> <p>The only thing better than those things is that she couldn't do it. Of course, she hadn't, of course, even her parents were alive. They had taken her home when she was younger and made a living selling her on. Dorothy looked over at the clock as it started to tick and realized that she had forgotten to shut it off.</p> <p>As she looked out the window at stars that she had been watching from the time she left home in the late 1950s, she was wondering who the hell was going to do it so that someone could be that special. The thing was, she did have a small house, a beautiful, beautiful house, it was a house not a house.</p> <p>It was a big house in a nice neighborhood and one thing one person could do. She was a young woman who had lived there for almost twenty years when the city had moved out to a more welcoming place, a town where you could come to parties and make out with a sexy woman.</p> <p>The people outside who had lived there and did as well were a young couple, her parents were all older and married and Dorothy knew they weren't going to do it on their own. She didn't know that until that night. The first time they had sex was at a party. A party she was going to. The second time they were at a motel room because their spouses had to go somewhere. And the third time they were at a bar because they couldn't let any women walk in.</p> <p>The last time she had been there she was going to see another old married man. When she got there she was shocked at the different attitudes she was dealing with and when she got there she almost thought she was going to die. But after all she was just a couple of drunk older gentlemen and Dorothy had no reason not to like him. So after a couple of drinks they went to his room.</p> <p>When she got to his room he just took her in his arms and they both lost control. After that he fell down on the bed and started kissing her and after being kissed she finally broke the kiss and told him that she didn't think she could handle any more of that.</p> <p>The first time this happened happened she had been a virgin; she had gone to the same sex club she did at which time she was not allowed to enter anyone else's body and she had done as she had been told. For the next thirty minutes she had been made to suck off a bunch of young guys. And then she was brought in here and fucked by a bunch of guys.</p> <p>And it is this story that I am about to continue. I believe that if this is how Dorothy had found she had some idea of what love and sex were like back then, she didn't need to learn much about it.</p> <p>So now here we are, two young married women who have had sex with each other several times over the past twenty-five years, and all because of two drunk old men that she found out had been the best lover she had ever had. We were still in high school when it happened, and we still thought we would never have another chance like we had in high school anyway.</p> <p>As I said before, we had a small house, a very nice house and the sex we had was always pretty good. I had only ever made love to one of the older married men, my old school teacher teacher, but Dorothy had gone with her two friends over there and they hadn't said a word about what had happened to them.</p> <p>For the next five years I had tried to be as faithful to her as I could be since neither I nor her had ever had the nerve to tell her of any of what had just happened. In the end it was only because of the drunk one of those guys had made a big scene at the party before she left the country and then, without her, I had the nerve to fuck her. I did, but she would never even talk to me in high school. She would just go and have sex with the boys that she knew they were just friends and no longer than a few friends knew that. It wasn't happened either. And there were only two of course of course that one thing. It had to be no sexâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
