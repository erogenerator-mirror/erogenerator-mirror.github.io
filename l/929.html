That was all that could be said about him. Thanks to the</strong> Internet age age of communication with a whole bunch of geeks and nerds. We were all too busy with school and work to worry about that, right? Well, not a lot. It was kind of all that with that big-titted guy.</p> <p>It was just that old cliché, 'it doesn't happen all the time'. I've heard that a million times, back when most of my classmates were still in eighth and ten through high school, I still had dreams of spending my adolescence doing something cool and wild and crazy.</p> <p>Anyway, back when I was in middle school and high school, I used to be like that all the time. But then I started working up to adulthood, right in the summer of 2008. Back then it was some crazy, crazy fun, just like at school back then. I was a cheerleader, and I still can be. But I'm trying to go out there and do what I was good for. I can go wild - and do crazy things with everybody's eyes. Who knows, maybe it might even save me some people's lives.</p> <p>Back in high school, most of your friends are gone, and then I meet you guys all working at some crazy website, and we're all gonna have a thing. We're just going to be friends, nothing more, because I'm never going to meet the right guy.</p> <p>So that brings me back to the beginning. Yes, I've had a few crazy ideas, but my favorite was just a couple different things.</p> <p>I was in the middle of a hot tub one afternoon, enjoying it immensely. You'd think I'd go into the house, and just strip down naked for you guys, or go into the house and see what was going on in the hot tub or what-not, but I was all sweaty, horny and alone. Besides, I was already naked. I went into the room, and laid down on the bed, my legs spread apart and my fingers around my clit, as if I'd have something ready to be rubbed or pressed against, if you catch my drift. Well, as if I was going out there naked, in the hot tub with another dude, because I was already wet. After a short time of me rubbing my boobs and fingering myself furiously, I couldn't even tell what time it was, and I began to moan.</p> <p>I was so wet that I thought I might actually slide on the mattress.</p> <p>You'd think I could hear you all of a reason, that maybe I was going to hear something, and, if not, maybe I'd just start moaning louder like a horny girl. Of course, it's only that there were only two doors, so I guess it might happen again.</p> <p>I was thinking, I know, maybe I could get them to change their mind. But before I knew it, I thought about maybe having a nice little game to finish me off on. But instead, I just started getting more and more embarrassed. I knew that this was probably a mistake, but it had to be a very nice, very special, unforgettable feeling.</p> <p>I thought that maybe this time I could really let them know that the good times with girls weren't just the ones they thought they could be into. Maybe I could put some of my fantasies on the line. Maybe I could say that a girl's name or a nice sexy outfit was sexy or something. But that might be the ticket for that hot bath scene at that website. Maybe I could have my way with them. Maybe I could come up there and bend over and take them in my mouth, and give them a handjob or finger-fuck. Maybe my breasts could slide up and down and up and down on their own, and my nipples were like little rocks, as I rubbed them through my bathrobe.</p> <p>And some hot tub. Maybe that could work.</p> <p>I got up then, and got into bed, thinking all of these great ideas and ideas, imagining their sweet wet mouths, sucking my nipples, holding them in their purses, and sucking my clitty. I thought they'd take off my bathrobe to be like a bunch of little ice-cream monsters that come up for our warm baths, and they wouldn't stop kissing me. They'd do it there and then. My nipples and nipples and nipples. Yeah, then I'd be feeling their cocks between their legs, and they'd grab hands and suck my nipples, suck my breasts, and grab my hand. I'd be feeling their balls aching cocks rubbing up to my fingers while they'd suck my fingers or to my lips, and I'd be sucking my mouth...</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>God, and the way I'd think it... and the way that it could be.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>-and, and you'd</p> <p>-and - I think—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
