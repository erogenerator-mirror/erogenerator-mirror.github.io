To Mr. Bennet's mind, he was no better than the only one in the room.</p> <p>"Have you ever been fucked in your vagina?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered after a brief hesitation, "I've had one of the most intense orgasms of my life - in a roomful of strangers." He smiled warmly at her and reached into one of the large trays. "And when I finally get them into me and it really goes on, I'll have you begging me to fuck you all over again." Mr. Bennet, who had just enjoyed the taste and feel of her vagina, had begun to slowly undress her, and when he had her naked, Mr. Bennet had to take her back to a room of strangers he knew only too well. He held her in his arms like a man possessed, feeling himself grow hard in anticipation, and with a soft chuckle, he began to move his hips against hers, feeling her body against him, the sweet softness of her mouth, the gentle warmth and the wetness of her body against him, and the strength of her legs against his thighs. He had fucked the women in his dreams but never found anyone that could give him as much pleasure as she did.</p> <p>They ended up having sex on the back porch of a small estate, standing together in front of a large, sturdy wooden stable. Mr. Bennet had only felt her passion when they had been in his apartment, but, when on his back, with his feet on the ground with two women, her legs open and his face buried in her wet pussy, her arms around his neck while the blond woman held him, he had forgotten what it was his wife had called them. His whole life, he had known that it was impossible for her to feel pleasure like that. But, once she gave him a blowjob, his whole life was forgotten.</p> <p>Later, in the garden, in the sun, he discovered that he did not feel his tongue on her clitoris. He was able to tell that not only did her clitoris stay erect, but that her pubic bone was soft and smooth beneath his fingers. He knew that her vagina was incredibly tight but that it could easily accommodate a man's tongue.</p> <p>"I've never been so fucking well fucked in my life," she said, when Mr. Bennet had finally penetrated her with his cock.</p> <p>"You want you're first time to be with my brother?" he asked.</p> <p>She had nodded. "I know. I just love his cock," she answered, but now it was Mr. Bennet that had surprised her. Before her, for that moment in time, he had brought her up to the height of wildness. Now he was holding her and kissing her, the heat of his body pressing against her was more incredible than any time before. Now their lovemaking was deeper. She felt the hardness of his cock against her clitoris through the thin membrane between her legs. She knew he was hard just from the sound of her voice, and she knew it even as he fucked her.</p> <p>His cock was long and hard inside her already. The heat of him drove her to reach for her first orgasm, and they both knew it. They both came together.</p> <p>Mr. Bennet came inside her again, and then held her close in his arms until the warm feeling of the afterglow had all ebbed away. They continued to hold and stroke each other there at the garden. After the sun was up and it was early, they went indoors.</p> <p>"My brother has his own room," Mr. Bennet began. "What about you?"</p> <p>"I do," she answered. "Would you like to go to the same one I did?"</p> <p>"As long as we can have another round of fun," he said.</p> <p>"Well then, if my brother wants an evening with you two", she said, "I'll see what a fun evening would be." She looked him askance for a moment: "What would you like to do for a night? Are you ready?"</p> <p>He smiled at her, thinking to himself: "Is it possible? After all it had been quite some time since we had seen each other." He was thinking more and more. Was he ready? Was she ready?</p> <p>"I think that I would like that," he said. "What about your husband? I'd love if he wanted to fuck me again just once."</p> <p>"It would be nice; he's married and has a nice little wife," she said. "But I'm not sure the taste of the young man was enough to keep him going. How about your wedding. Do you. You said you love me too, how you'll want to marry me?"</p> <p>"Let's be your wife in a few years ago, don't likeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
