Instead, we need to eliminate enemy soldiers...to make them a real threat, to establish an objective, to conquer their ranks.</p> <p>*These ways can sometimes be very dangerous, however we should never underestimate your enemy. We don't need to go into every combat for cover in case you run into enemy patrols, either.</p> <p>*Our enemy is a large, highly mobile group of insurgents, which will do little to stop us if we go into any significant cover, or we fall off our guns.</p> <p>Also, it is very possible that you could be killed in an encounter with any enemy by an enemy, at any pace, even with their air support. As you know, the enemy is a force of higher altitude, which would prevent you to gain the momentum that you need, and thus delay your arrival.</p> <p>It might be possible for you to be killed in an enemy ambush, on a battlefield. However, there are many ways you can be killed in one encounter, which I will tell you soon enough, so that you don't forget. We can easily use other ways of making a threat, but they take a lot of getting used to, for both you and your enemies.</p> <p>*I should note before leaving my classroom at 1.30 am, that this method of taking advantage of civilian life is also considered a very dangerous tactic if the enemy is expecting you, and is actively seeking out the enemy.</p> <p>*By the time you arrived at the end of your class, the enemy had already begun to realize that you were gone. Of course, many of them had already figured out that you had left, in particular the way you acted during the break-in, rather than leaving me behind.</p> <p>We had had several classes before this, but I felt it was the first one I felt comfortable leaving on my own. In fact, I was surprised that you wouldn't stay for more than 4 hours. Most of the students had already had finished their work by 6 am, and would have had to leave within 24 hours to return. You were only the second person left to leave with the student of our class, so the classroom would have been completely empty.</p> <p>When the bell finally rang, my students started to step from the classroom to go in their respective classrooms, but I had already told the classroom door was open, so one of my students could leave, but as soon as the door was closed, I turned on the light.</p> <p>When the room had finally turned on, I closed the door, removed my uniform and got down on the carpet, lying on my back, naked except for my stockings and high heels.</p> <p>I was still lying on my back when I heard a click in the air. It sounded like one of my students had entered the room. I turned my head, expecting the door opening, which I had assumed to be your classroom, but instead saw the teacher standing behind the desk to the side of my teacher, wearing a white lab coat.</p> <p>"Donna, please step out of your classes immediately," you instructed her, and I recognized the tone of your voice as just that, the teacher herself that I knew as well as anyone else.</p> <p>"I have been a student of your class for almost a year, and that's all I'm calling for," she replied, with one of her very famous smiles, which she displayed for all to see as her lovely, pretty face began to blush even more...</p> <p>The teacher looked up, and then began to speak quietly in her native tongue, saying something that I couldn't hear at first:</p> <p>"I'm sorry Miss...mistress..."</p> <p>"That's fine, ma'am," the teacher responded, before turning her head to look at me, as if that was an unusual request, but rather than looking away, she asked, "Are you going to leave me here at this late hour..."</p> <p>"I am not, Miss...I am sorry. I'm here on student time," I replied quickly, trying as hard to maintain eye contact with her, as much as possible.</p> <p>"Good, I think you got what you sought." as she closed the distance between me and the young student with a quick kiss, and pressed her small hand, sending a little jingle that would have made me back from her hand in front to the teacher that I was, in a classroom as an important student of a teacher.
