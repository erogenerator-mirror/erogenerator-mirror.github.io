The Forge.</h4><p><strong>With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand</strong> holding out a set of four steel rings.</p> <p>"It wouldn't be right if the fireman came and tried to take it away, but he'll have to do, or we're done here."</p> <p>"But he's such a man, and so good to protect," said a young man called Alistair from his camp, as he stepped out from his tent. With the sound of his zipper being yanked down, his cock came free, but it still throbbed in his hand, and he stroked away.</p> <p>The fireman had followed Alistair into camp, his erection already beginning to show signs of life at the excitement and anticipation.</p> <p>Alistair pulled Alistair's pants down around his thighs, and Alistair was already sporting a full erection. He pulled Alistair's underpants down around his ankles, revealing his erection, which he was already stroking, while he lay on his back, with his erection in his hand.</p> <p>"Ooohh, fuck," said Alistair, "I've been a little excited, with all that stuff you did last week. Now, let's see what happens."</p> <p>While stroking Alistair's erection, Alistair sat up and began to unbutton his shirt, but he stopped and said, "No, this will only be a start."</p> <p>"No, you don't need to do that. After all, you are a natural..."</p> <p>"Ah, and a man should know how to control a man..."</p> <p>"Mmmm...I'm getting close, I think."</p> <p>"Not yet," said Alistair, "I can't keep this up until you've cum, and if it happens again..."</p> <p>"Oh, yes," said Alistair, "I have an incredible feeling about this."</p> <p>"Me too, I suppose, but...I don't want to cum here."</p> <p>"Well, you could take your dick out, and I'll let you play with that beautiful thing."</p> <p>"What does that mean?"</p> <p>"If we're to see you cum, it won't be long, and it won't leave that lovely wet pussy of yours empty."</p> <p>Alistair gave Alistair a wicked laugh, and said, "Yes, I'll take my dick out when it is necessary."</p> <p>As he finished unbuttoning his shirt, Alistair, sitting up, pulled Alistair's shirt over his head, as he said, "No bra, and no underwear, then," as he removed his shirt. Alistair's hard dick bounced from the impact of his shorts hitting the log, and for a moment, Alistair felt nervous that he'd gone too far in this, but that didn't stop him from admiring the sight of Alistair's nude body.</p> <p>Seeing Alistair's cock, Alistair knew that when it came to a man's erect penis, he could be a bit of a prude. He had a very big dick, about five inches long, with a large purple head at the top. However, unlike most men, Alistair was well-endowed. If anything, Alistair's cock was so thick, it almost reached the base of his chest, or his hips if he was standing. Alistair imagined that, if he could just lean over, he could run his lips over Alistair's dick and play with his balls whenever he could.</p> <p>"I don't think I'm going to last long, but I'm a bit more eager than," Alistair said, as he got down on his knees and began to stroke his cock. Even though he was about to blow a wad into Alistair's hand, he stopped, before he ejaculated, and said, "I'm getting close. Can we stop?"</p> <p>"Oh, so soon. I don't think I can hold it long."</p> <p>"Do you want me to suck it?"</p> <p>"Silly question. I'm about to cum in your mouth," Alistair replied, as he looked up into Alistair's blue eyes.</p> <p>Alistair didn't answer, just smiled, and began sucking, while stroking his own cock. He kept a firm grip on Alistair's balls, while keeping his free hand firmly in place on Alistair's erection, and kept sucking. After several minutes, when Alistair was beginning to buck in his mouth, he stopped and said, "Wait, I need to change clothes."</p> <p>Alistair asked, "What? Why?" as he turned around to see a discarded items on the opposite side table.</p> <p>Alistair said, "Oh for one of course there is a set, as he, so there a way, for another of me," and way of the other that is," and otherâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
