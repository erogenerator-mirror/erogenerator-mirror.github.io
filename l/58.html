Not only did Elizabeth like fucking Mr. Bingley when he had time, but she liked it when he fucked her when the time came. And when Mr. Bingley wasn't being fucked, Elizabeth liked being fucked, too.</p> <p>But that didn't mean anything about what happened between Elizabeth and Mr. Bingley? Elizabeth didn't know what it meant, but she was already being fucked, and she didn't give a shit what it meant anymore. It made no difference who fucked who: she was fucking other men, and she wanted to be fucked. She didn't really care who she fucking was with. All that mattered was having sex.</p> <p>At long last, when a man and a woman finally came back together at last, that was what Elizabeth found her mind focused on: being fucked! She couldn't believe that the sexual gratification of fucking another lover was so much better than the pleasure of having someone else fucking her. She couldn't believe that she was having sex with Mr. Bingley because the two of them had to be fucking each other to get the fucking of the century. She had to have her pleasure on the back of that person's cock. At the moment, with the right man inside her so much as that person was fucking her and Mr. Bingley fucking her back, she couldn't believe having two men fuck her at the same time could be so much better than having two other cocks in her at the same time. She couldn't believe it was so much better on so many levels in such a short time that it was so much more than two cocks, and she couldn't believe that she was about to get so much better on so many levels in the same period in her life. What was that saying? "You're a fucking goddess." What was that saying? "You're an awesome fuck." Well, maybe it wasn't just the words but how they sounded! It was the phrase, "fuck me, use me." All that it said was, "fuck me." With that in mind, she got up on her hands and knees and crawled to Mr. Bingley so he could stick his cock in her and help her get ready for fucking. And then she knelt behind him as he bent over the back of his desk. She knelt behind him in a 69 and slipped him into her pussy. She got down on her knees behind him again.</p> <p>She put her tongue at his asshole and got it wet and ready. It was like she was about to slide it inside his asshole while licking his ass. Then she slid her tongue inside his ass.</p> <p>"Fuck!" Mr. Bingley yelled. "That feels great," he said. "You're gonna fuck both Mr. or Mrs. Lindstrom! Fuck! Yes! Fuck!" Then he turned around. He kissed Elizabeth as he lifted her off the floor. And then he kissed her again. Finally, he stopped kissing her and they got their breath back, before saying, "Mr. Lindstrom, I hope to fuck lots of men over time but none have fucked me at the same speed. With Mr. Bingley as our host today, we should be getting married at some time in the future. If we're both a good host, we'll be in one room, you and I. Okay?"</p> <p>"Sure, Mr. Lindstrom. I mean, I'm sure your idea of fun was fun. And we'd love to share it." They both just had their faces in Elizabeth's pussy, and her orgasm began. Elizabeth didn't care. Mr. Bingley had his hands on her head, but Mr. Bingley had his hands on her tits. She came all over his cock and Mr. Lindstrom had his hands on her ass. Elizabeth and Mr. Bingley had cocks inside of them, but none of them had been in their ass. They were still naked from what they were wearing that day. In fact, their only clothes were that they were wearing underwear, and their pussies were still covered up with underwear. Elizabeth and Mr. Bingley took no time to clean up a little. Mr. Lindstrom took a bottle of Astro-Glide, a second one for Elizabeth and a third one for Mr. Bingley. They each licked them while Mr. Lindstrom finished lapping up all their come.</p> <p>"When did you get so horny?" Elizabeth asked to no one in particular. "You were always fucking Mr. Lindstrom."</p> <p>"It was like I was in a trance," Mr. Lindstrom replied. "Like you got me to do it when I was a teenager. Or, like I was at that time."</p> <p>Elizabeth sat up a little and said, "I'm sure I'm horny too. I had such a good at that was you, at being a guy in a man in a man a man a woman. You're a woman in a woman be a woman a. andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
