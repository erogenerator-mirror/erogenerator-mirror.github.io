Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the</h4><p><strong>bodies and substances themselves, into the matter and substance of the world: and their memories into the general age and time of the world. Consider the nature of all worldly</strong> objects in our universe. We're still the first things made by Man as the main reason humankind made the most of the millennia of humanity's evolution from Man to Human.</p> <p>This is why I called it a moment's pleasure: a special kind of pleasure, because of the moment of orgasm. I had one in my hands and my body was feeling it. I came with a mind-like release of life energy. It was very intense! As a woman, it was a relief. I was still feeling some kind of pleasure from my orgasm. Then, in the midst of a new mind-like, sexual experience I thought: "I'm not going out of my way to be in the right moment, but to be in the right spot..."</p> <p>My first orgasm was just the first of many. The second was also a welcome one. I was now in the right places.</p> <p>For me, the first orgasm is always a memorable moment and especially among a man. It's been a long, long time since I came so many times during one orgasm. It happened many years ago; it happens every day, like it did every day of my life, all those years ago, before my time as a woman, until my time as a man.</p> <p>It's one of the many places men fuck women, whenever they're interested.</p> <p>For some reason, many of the first orgasms of my life were by men. I liked it so much, because I was going to be one man. I liked it more after my orgasm.</p> <p>We all enjoy sexual pleasures to our fullest. We're all more sensitive after experiencing them.</p> <p>I was feeling very good and I could feel it. It was another good orgasm. It's been a long time since I had one in my body. My orgasmic feeling was the same as men's, although not as intense -- more like a mind-link like men's -- and then women's.</p> <p>For me, it was a good orgasm when the woman on my right was doing so. It was also the first time I've felt my orgasm coming so hard. It felt so marvelous and exhilarating. The new woman's face was so familiar and the feeling of physical pleasure of pleasure filled my vision.</p> <p>So beautiful!</p> <p>"Oh! Yessss! Oh!" I moaned as an unexpected orgasm overcame me. I'd never felt such pleasure before. It must've looked incredible. Even though my own orgasm was at about the same peak, the first orgasm of my life was even more intense.</p> <p>For me, it felt even better. Maybe it's because I'm a woman!</p> <p>The feeling of orgasm is like an instant of light; or a moment of being. It feels like an electrical charge. Just the sight of the woman standing naked above me, in that perfect, naked, beautiful body, while she's standing and masturbating herself while I am in front of me, my penis, which is erect, to her in front of her face.</p> <p>The moment is perfect. It's like the feeling of being in love. It's like the feeling of being in love. It's the sensation of having my mind be united and shared with the other person in a mutual, sexual act. And I was giving it to her in the most beautiful way I can.</p> <p>It was one of the most delightful moments of my life. There was nothing less that the feeling of having sex with a woman. I enjoyed the feeling of her naked body, the way it looked in the candlelight when we'd first met and we'd met the way it was with the light of the candle, in the midst of night.</p> <p>I also felt it. It was also like the moment of an explosion of pleasure. It was wonderful, like having another orgasm with the feeling of pleasure. I had this moment, I experienced my first one with another woman.</p> <p>All the women felt it with me as I experienced it with the woman of my life. It made me feel even more in love with her. I felt like I was giving her pleasure, like I was giving her pleasure from giving pleasure to another woman.</p> <p>And then, that moment of sexual pleasure began to have its true effect. The pleasure, of that moment, was like the electric rush of an errant voltage rushing through an electrical charge of the entire universe, one that was coursed through me and had no time to come to an end. In the moment of orgasm, when pleasure overtakes pleasure, I was lost in that moment, where it will stop, when pleasure again is only fleeting, and if the pleasure is greater than the pleasure for all of the life time and the world before it, I'm lost in it.</p> <p></p> <p>But to the woman that moment, that is what is the greatest, the most preciousest of all the most of the best in-foreverst of the most important of the most memorable.
