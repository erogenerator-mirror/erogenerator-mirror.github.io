G. Wells </h3><h4>UNDER FOOT.</h4><p><strong>In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters I and</strong> my sisters have written we have found ourselves at the epicenter of each other's life and in my own stories from the past, so that we can both be close friends and confidante.</p> <p>And today when we got done, I wanted to finish the books and to put the paper work in a box so I could hang them on the wall next to the fireplace and write about what happened. But the fact that our relationship has continued, even though we know each other's story and have been very happy friends to do that, does not mean that we are going to try to change anything now.</p> <p>Well I think what we need to do is change the past year is to change our lives.</p> <p>We have been going steady in the past year and then we've stopped being on the dating thing because we have been getting along great since we started going steady. We have even found some hot girls to date that we like and that we'd enjoy going out to dinner with them and to have wild sex with them. We have gotten together with some great women on several occasions and the few times that we have gone on a date with any of them seemed to be one night. So we both feel that we could change things once and for all, so we have started to think about that.</p> <p>Well we have been going on the dating thing for a couple of months now and we decided that maybe we could see how well things are going to go between us. We both want to take a little time to just relax and just enjoy the time we have together as friends but we both feel that there is something missing. So if you have any ideas what do you thinkâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
