Mother and Son</h4><p><strong>The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile, and got into his carriage with Maximilian and Emmanuel. Albert, Beauchamp, and Château-Renaud</strong>, accompanied by the Count. Maximilian had his arm around the Count's waist. It would be a pleasant day to be among the count's favorite students.</p> <p>It was only a few moments later that the Count began to undress. He was almost ready to kiss his way down the young man's muscled body. He smiled and raised himself on his hand. His hands began to caress the naked man. He ran his fingers up and down the length of his own legs and stomach. And then he was reaching down with his hand to spread the Count's buttock; and with gentle fingers to spread the cheeks. As Maximilian drew his tongue against the man's anus, Beauchamp reached out and cupped the Count's buttocks. His tongue made a trail down Maximilian's back, and continued around to his thighs. And when the Count raised himself so that Beauchamp could take him in the mouth, the two men engaged in a passionate 69, where Maximilian licked the Count's pussy while licking the Count's anus.</p> <p>Then the Count mounted Maximilian for the first time. But this time, the Count entered slowly in his eagerness. Beauchamp, being the youngest, came first, and Maximilian was forced to hold the Count in his mouth while he thrust his tongue into the Count's ass while Beauchamp was doing his duty at the count's pussy. That was as much the Count's pleasure as the Count's discomfort. And when he came, he took his mouth off the Count's buttocks and squeezed them hard with his hands. And when Beauchamp came too, he squeezed Maximilian hard around the waist. The two men were in a sixty-nine with one another, with both men ejaculating into the other's mouth. The two men shared as many orgasms as each man would want in a single night.</p> <p>When the two men left the room, the Count closed his eyes and turned over with his head on the Count's chest and kissed him lightly on the cheek. He whispered his thanks and walked out. Maximilian knelt before him and kissed his head. He lifted the Count's limp dick in his fingers and began to lick and suck his head. He held his head against his own mouth and kissed him passionately behind the ear and neck. And after a while, he leaned down. "Sara," he whispered, "I want you to be my first. You deserve it, too, because you're special, and I want to be your first in everything." And Maximilian gave his head a quick lick.</p> <p>After the Count took off the robe he'd removed from the Count's body, he pulled Maximilian to face him. A moment later he embraced Maximilian, and the two embraced one another, kissing tenderly. "Sara," he whispered, "I've dreamed of this moment ever since my first glimpse of you. And I'll never forget it." And he pulled the Count into him.</p> <p>Maximilian kissed and licked his way toward the Count's cock. Then Maximilian moved away. He took the young man's hand and led him out of the room.</p> <p>"Wait here," and he closed the door and turned off the room lights. He went to the small bed, stripped, and lay down. Then he held his hand out.</p> <p>And without hesitating, Maximilian took it and moved on the bed to him. He kissed Max's neck and ears, and then, very gently, he put Maximilian's hand on his penis.</p> <p>He moved it slowly, kissing the smooth, skin. The Count's eyes were fluttering back and forth; they were watching and listening; Maximilian was slowly stroking his own hard member. Their eyes met.</p> <p>"It's beautiful to me," said Maximilian and then kissed the Count, gently, sensually, for a moment or two. He looked at Maximilian. He saw a little tear in the Count's bottom lip. He touched it tenderly. "Do you want to be my first? Do you want to be in my bed? Do you want me to make you my special, gorgeous, beautiful man?"</p> <p>Maximilian's breathing was coming faster. He saw that the Count was beginning to blush; he stopped kissing him, moved his lips down the Count's neck; he kissed the hollow near the throat; he ran his tongue there. As Maximilian's lips neared his neck, he felt Maximilian's right hand take his hardness in his fingers. He pushed the head against the hair on Maximilian's right hip, and the crown, and he felt Maximilian. He stroked the crown. Then Maximilian's shaft-bed his hand on his shaft. Maximilians' balls with the underside. Maximili's fingers. And felt the cock—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
