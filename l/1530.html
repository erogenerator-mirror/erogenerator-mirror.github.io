English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XIII — CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE’S OWN</h4><p><strong>Auxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope Julius in the</strong> Roman Catholic religion.</p> <p>So, we did it. We let men, women and children fuck. We even took pictures of the men and women, men and children having sex with the men, while making up to them by doing it. It's a fun, and it's not as bad of a sex act as sex play is when you have a prince there, and you know exactly what he likes, and what he likes and doesn't.</p> <p>We used to do it while they were together, because it felt really good to think about them, but we lost the sexiness to them, so the real fun happened as soon as they got away.</p> <p>I think it was the end of the summer, when the only thing I really wanted to do to them was to fuck them. I never said anything about it, but if I ever got a date from them, I'd fuck them. No condoms, no alcohol, it's just going to be their turn to choose what he wants... I just didn't get to that point without them.</p> <p>Any way, we got out of town one day and were in a field, naked. I'm not sure how to describe it, except I can't remember. Not naked. Naked.</p> <p>I guess the name fits, but there was a field.</p> <p>"You're getting fucked already?" I asked.</p> <p>"How so?"</p> <p>I looked around. You know the girl, the one with the tight, perfect body? I've really liked her.</p> <p>"How many girls have you had?"</p> <p>"I don't remember. You?"</p> <p>"Oh God, no. I'm not sure. I think I came at least three times."</p> <p>That made you wonder at my own level? I didn't remember. I got the feeling it was going on somewhere else, in my mind, but I couldn't place it. I felt totally fucked, except I was the only one. Then I looked around.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, I feel you."</p> <p>Then it hit me. I couldn't remember.</p> <p>"That's okay, it's okay. It's real easy to remember sometimes. Anyway, I don't remember. I didn't feel like I'd gotten away with it at all."</p> <p>"Why did you think you walked off into the swamp just for me?"</p> <p>She was right about one thing, I wasn't getting away. You never really knew where you got the vibe and how to get from the swamp, to the other side. I still remember that day, that first day at all. It's as if it happened that first time.</p> <p>Then the story stopped. We started again. It wasn't really a story, actually, it was a memory. It was that first afternoon in the middle of summer with the ocean behind us. It was that first day. The first time we had sex the first time I knew it was all going to be great, right? It was a memory, at the very least. I was still going to get fucked in the first place.</p> <p>"It wasn't just that we came home that day, it was also my second time in town."</p> <p>"You did what you thought I wanted, didn't you? I remember. I don't know much else."</p> <p>"Then you started fucking her in the middle of the night." He started laughing.</p> <p>I didn't know what he was laughing at. After that first time, I got so fucking horny I could hardly walk normally. Every time we met at the airport, after he was in a cab, he would whisper something about why I was in so much trouble over there... the truth would just keep going, I guess.</p> <p>He didn't say anything about my relationship to my wife. He was telling me what a good time they had, and what he was going to do to her, the two of them. And he still thought me too sexy to fuck in front of my wife.</p> <p>I never told our friends that story or that my affair with my wife was the only true affair. I can't explain that it makes sense for them to know what we did.</p> <p>If it was true, it was our first time. We had made it as far as a couple when we met in that field, back before that day. The day when I knew our relationship had changed.</p> <p>My wife had called the next day after me getting back. She had met him at the airport and they were both there, at my car. We got into my car and went home, then met him. We had another good time at the next week the following that we got home.</p> <p></p> <p>fucked, didn't even a few more than this summer, until next week our second time—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
