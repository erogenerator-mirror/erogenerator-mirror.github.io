She had no intention of having a child. And in her condition and nature, her vagina could not possibly be considered a vagina.</p> <p>"It was wonderful, Marianne, as long as I can remember."</p> <p>"I know about your little clitoris and about your rectum."</p> <p>Marianne started to pull her panties down.</p> <p>"No, not yet. Keep the elastic."</p> <p>Marianne felt the elastic between her cheeks and the panties at once. But the elastic stopped them from slipping down on their own.</p> <p>"If you keep pulling my panties down, they may come off in the end."</p> <p>"Is that so important?"</p> <p>"Of course not." "Take off my panties."</p> <p>It was impossible. She felt the panties at the back.</p> <p>"Take them off."</p> <p>They began rolling over. The two sides of her vagina began to slide backwards and forwards, back and forth, as one side of her pubic bush continued to slide down inside her body.</p> <p>"You may take my panties off now."</p> <p>So she did. And when the crotch of her panties came off, the elastic of her anal plug was released. It was pulled down to the small of her back, and she felt a moment's pressure through the flesh behind the plug as they pushed it out a little.</p> <p>She had never been fucked there in the first place.</p> <p>But this was a first for her, and she thought she knew how to please it.</p> <p>She pulled down her panties slightly, and the elastic slipped inside her. Like she had told that it was the right position for her anus to close. When she had brought the panties out, they slid right back where you put them in, over her anus, and into her vagina. She had a bit of a dilemma. She could lie on her side, or kneel, which opened her legs as much as she could, except that the plug was inside her vagina, and her pussy juice lubricated her anus as she crouched, and the panties were inside her buttocks, and the plug inside her vagina. On her knees, she could use both hands: hold her buttocks, if it might be a more suitable position. The combination would be perfect for the intercourse: the one and only.</p> <p>"Now roll over again." she heard Marianne croak.</p> <p>And when she rolled onto her hands and knees, the nylon of her panties slipped around her hips, and she felt the crotch slide off her bottom. With some difficulty, she had to press herself down.</p> <p>With the panties now free, she turned her head back to see Marianne, naked but for her panties in her lap, and her own panties in her hands.</p> <p>"I thought you forgot them."</p> <p>"I didn't. I put my hand in your panties."</p> <p>Marianne had been a virgin back then, but her arousal had taken control of her. She took her hands away from her waist and pushed the back of her panties towards the front for Marianne. Marianne stepped forward and opened her legs.</p> <p>"Let me."</p> <p>Marianne stepped forward, and the panties fell off her to the top of her thighs.</p> <p>"There."</p> <p>The pair of panties were in her hands for a moment. Their fragrance filled the air. Marianne had been turned on by what the other woman had done to her. Her heart rate rose, and her pulse quickened.</p> <p>"Put my panties to the side. I'll take them off myself."</p> <p>Marianne put her own panties aside. She knelt there, in the chair, and pulled the panties upwards so they slid all the way down. At her waist, she pulled the panties all the way to the bed, then sat upon it, while Marianne took hers off her to give her the panties that had been in it when her knees had been apart.</p> <p>"They were lovely, and they made the bed so slippery."</p> <p>"I liked to try it."</p> <p>"The feel of your pubic hair on my cheeks and your ass."</p> <p>She knelt on the bed, and opened her legs so Marianne could touch her pubic hair.</p> <p>"You're all slippery, Marianne, now."</p> <p>"I like that, too."</p> <p>"Mmmm. Now I love what you do down there."</p> <p>She lay there, waiting, and Marianne began to masturbate herself. The first touches of the fingers of the other two women and of both of them made her feel more like a sex doll – the bed of soft, pink, damp hairless furled flesh, or the pussy on her face, the pillow, she felt her vulva.</p> <p>down there was she began</p> <p>down there, and she wanted up her, then, and up—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
