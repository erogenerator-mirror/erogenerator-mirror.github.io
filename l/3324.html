English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXVI. Out of Service.</h4><p><strong>Zarathustra now meets the last pope, and, in a poetical form, we get Nietzsche’s description of the course Judaism and Christianity pursued before they reached their final break-up in Atheism,</strong> but now its time to live the dream.</p> <p>The Pope, now famous for his famous speech about the Roman Catholic Church, was already inside his house, reading a Bible while we ate at the pizzeria. The Pope announced he was coming and kissed each of us on the forehead, but his eyes were bright; he made a motion with his hands. All that mattered was the pope. Zarathustra was a big, tall, thin Catholic and was in fact born in New Hampshire; I was born in Boston, although Zarathustra was originally born in the United States of America. Our future king, and his daughter, the Pope, were waiting for us. When he got home from work, Zarathustra turned to face him. In a short moment he came to me, and said something that I found very funny.</p> <p>“Zarathustra,” I said, kissing him. When I asked him what the Pope was looking for, he told me, “For you, Zarathustra,” and he kissed me again. We stood there, kissing. My eyes were closed; Zarathustra's hands moved to my neck, unbuttoned my shirt, and I gasped as it fell to the floor. It felt good. Aroused beyond control, I took off my shirt and reached around behind me and fumbled around with his belt buckle. “ Zarathustra, we had sex,” I said, and he kissed me again, and I undid his pants button to fly. I was not sure about my own. I could have done it with a better candidate on the outside, but the pope had to know that I was a little crazy, the Pope’s daughter. I knelt, and sucked his cock, feeling the warmth and texture. The pope put his hands on my head as I bobbed on him, and I did not care how much I sucked. Soon his dick was erect and I was bobbing up and down on it. I reached up and started playing with his balls. Then I started licking the inside of his thigh, and he moaned. Zarathustra smiled down at me, his eyes gleaming in the dim light.</p> <p>We changed positions; now we were sixty-nineing. My legs were spread and I was squatting so he could have his way with me. My hands were all up and down his legs as he licked me. I was on top of him, his face pressing against my pussy, and while I licked me it was his tongue which made me cum.</p> <p>When I recovered myself with a breathless gasp and a moan, Zarathustras mouth was busy on my pussy. He was licking my clit, and I was on the end of the couch and my legs were wide open and he was plunging his finger in and out of my pussy while he ate me. Zarathustras dick was hard and he was fucking me from underneath. My hands were on his chest, squeezing my breasts. All of a sudden I felt Zarathustra enter me, and my eyes bulged. “ Zarathustraaaaaa,” I blurted, and he fucked me so hard that I screamed. My entire body twitched and writed while he came inside of me. The pope, still at his desk, looked up at us from his chair, and smiled.</p> <p>Zarathustra kissed me again, and we got up, kissing all over our faces and faces, our faces. Our kisses lasted for what seemed like forever. Then the pope got off Zarathustras cock and said, “ Zarathustras, our relationship is finished.”</p> <p>“What about we fuck then?” The Pope asked.</p> <p>” Zarathustras,” I told him. We can’t wait to do it, love,” I said, then got off of Zarathustras cock and sat down on my face. I sucked him clean, while his tongue swirled about my pussy. He ate me to two cumloads, and again my pussy was flooded with juices. I was a mess; we were both exhausted. We had great sex, then we got up, went to the pope’s table, and did the deed.</p> <p>It occurred to me that after we had sex, Zarathustra never really stopped eating me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
