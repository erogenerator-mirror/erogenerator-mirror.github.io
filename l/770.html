JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE</h4><p><strong>A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of</strong> that name.</p> <p>He was a big fan and was proud to be able to meet many of the potentialists in action to see what they think of everything. He was not really a big fan of his Dad's or his Mom's but he was proud to make it his own. For those who didn't know, He wasn't all that old in anyway, so no way I was old. Maybe fifty, but only to me. All the ladies did but the old ones said I was old.</p> <p>I could tell this conversation was going on between him and some unknown person or people. For someone my age, I didn't care what it was. All I'd care about was to get my hands on the boy who might have an interesting life. If his Aunt had anything to do with it; she'd just have to come up with a better deal to settle the debt of silence. The truth was what he was saying, he didn't care for my Aunt's idea of a good Christmas. He only cared that I wouldn't be his Aunt's daughter and the next thing he's going to realize we are cousins.</p> <p>"No, I don't think so," he said, "I've lived a long, long time. It isn't just to see how far I can stretch my legs," he mumbled looking down at the floor.</p> <p>"No, it's too bad," I added taking an opportunity to slip my hand between his legs. My Aunt just had to give me a good view when I wanted to see the most. He was so big and hard. I could tell he wasn't happy about that, either. His cock is pretty small by any means but not all that big by any means. It was thick, veiny, even with the foreskin. The skin was a little stretched by the blood in it, but it was still so hard and thick, even with the blood in it.</p> <p>I stroked him gently, slowly, feeling it twitch as I brushed against it. I loved having him this close. It made me feel sexy. For someone his age that didn't care much for a hard cock, it was an amazing thrill to stroke the long, thick monster.</p> <p>We'd decided to just go off into my bedroom. I got naked as I lay naked next to him on the bed. He was still standing in front of the mirror with his back facing it. He had this weird look in his eye that I couldn't even tell whether he liked me looking at him with the light of the moon or with his hair. The best way to describe it was as something totally innocent. Like, he looked at me like that when he got in, but I don't think he was looking at me the way he looked at me looking at him. He was looking at me the way he looked at his own father. He was looking at me with the same expression I looked at that old camera as he kept snapping pictures at us.</p> <p>"How could you look at me like that?" he asked. "Maybe if Daddy had an older camera, I would look like that." He was looking at his long cock again, and I wanted to just take it in my hand and stroke it a little.</p> <p>"No, it couldn't have been that way. That's a good sign you've been thinking about me all summer, you're such a stud," I cooed. "I can't believe you haven't had sex, but it is the truth. How big is your cock, and what kind of cum are you shooting?"</p> <p>"It's too bad you're a virgin," he blurted, "you wouldn't see me, though." It was one of those moments where you can honestly say you've had sex, but you want to make love in front of me. The way his voice sounded like a low, husky growl made me think about that.</p> <p>I gave him a knowing smile. "It's because you're just young and virile, sweetie," I said, "you wouldn't be virginal because you're a big boy. Maybe you could use the protection I have."</p> <p>His blush deepened and became a little more than usual, something it did not take, he didn't even say that, just closed his eyes and turned his face into his hand, touching it. I leaned against the wall with my head against it. I leaned closer, closer to him, and whispered in his ear, "It's not that I'm old that I'm not old, just that I like older men. Now do you like older men?"</p> <p>I felt like just taking a chance. We'd go off together with him so I could feel like having sex and being as my boyfriend and him having sex. After everything that, everything would be just about the same sex and everything, everything, like sharing. He's sex as a good, that would. I could be the same everythingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
