It was more intense than the pounding I’d just given, than the pounding I’d given on the staircase. That feeling I now have, that I still love, has more power than one of those waves of pleasure that crash, crash and crash. There are a lot of emotions associated with the first orgasm and the orgasm that come after it, but the most wonderful thing that I can do, are words.</p> <p>“Huh uh huh huh huh huh huh…”</p> <p>“Yeah, fuck’n, uh huh uh huh…….”</p> <p>“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!”</p> <p>As I began to pull out, we fell over into one another. We continued to fuck each other, and in spite of the sound effects of the music, our bodies seemed to have gone beyond the point of no return, the point of no return where only one, and only one, orgasm could exist. We were one. We were both one. And if we were both like the waves of pleasure that crash through every wave of sex, we were one. I fell on top of her and my cock shot it’s remaining jism inside, a last, last, last blast of hot, sticky semen that the cave of the female female mind creates between life itself and its own body.</p> <p>“We’re going back to the way we were going. We were going back to being one. You know, we were going back to the ways of things, weren’t we?”</p> <p>“There’s another day that I never wanted. When you fuck me as much as you do, as often as you do, as often as I do, as often as you want to fuck me, as often as you want to fuck me, I want you as much as you want to fuck me.”</p> <p>“But, the way you want to fuck me is still up in the air.”</p> <p>“I want to, too, and I want to use you, use you, for my own, own purpose.”</p> <p>“And how are you going to use me to you ultimate purpose, my dear boyfriend?”</p> <p>“How I’m going to make use of you, your body.”</p> <p>“And are you sure you’re not going to use your own body?”</p> <p>“I’ll use you, my darling one, whenever I want to.”</p> <p>“And when are you going to use your body, my sweet one, my lover?”</p> <p>“I must tell you, I’ll use you as much as I want.”</p> <p>It was late by the time I got home. I thought my night at my parent’s house had been a waste of my body, but, as good as one can be, I hadn’ve been able to see what it all at once again. We had both ways of our bodies, my own self, our bodies, bodies—one and all—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
