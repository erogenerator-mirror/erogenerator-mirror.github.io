Is it not a cruel thing to forbid men to affect those things, which</h4><p><strong>they conceive to agree best with their own natures, and to tend most to their own proper good and behoof? But thou after a sort deniest them this liberty, as</strong> well?</p> <p>"Oh God" she whispered "the gods above. I must"</p> <p>"Are ye not feeling it now?" I asked "you're a fool indeed!"</p> <p>She sighed. I had made love, she had done it. She had been fucking. All of it.</p> <p>She leaned forward to kiss me, her hair tickled my nose. Oh it was so warm. Her long neck, so graceful.</p> <p>"Can ye see? Can ye not look? I can see you. Your cock is hard, your eyes are watching me. I am getting you off!" she teased.</p> <p>"Your cunny is sopping," and I fucked. The first time, when it was just the two of us but the first time, when it wasn't my own cock pumping into her hot tightness or her fingers pinching and tugging her nipples she was riding me. "Come on, it feels better in my mouth"</p> <p>"Can I cum soon, honey?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm coming!" I panted "I'm coming."</p> <p>And she did, and I spurted again and again and again into her greedy mouth. She drank it all down with her mouth, moaning and groaning as it passed, as I had done, and as my hands clung to her hair.</p> <p>She rose and went to kiss me. I was feeling it again, too.</p> <p>"Oh! That was wonderful, honey." We just stood for another hour, kissing, cuddling, kissing for the first time after years</p> <p>"You have the most wonderful kisses"</p> <p>"For a man, you can go a very, very long way!"</p> <p>"It's so much nicer without hands," I said to her.</p> <p>I kissed each of her nipples gently as she lay beside me.</p> <p>"It was lovely for an old man!" she said.</p> <p>"It is!" I said, smiling.</p> <p>I kissed her hair again.</p> <p>"What did you say to me?" she asked.</p> <p>"You just told me it was the best sex you'd ever had."</p> <p>"That's okay, I didn't ask. It was what she said, I said.</p> <p>"She did say it was, it was the best sex she'd ever had."</p> <p>We cuddled together, kissing. Her nipples were soft in my hands and she pressed her soft breasts and I fondled them.</p> <p>"I think she meant what she said," she whispered.</p> <p>"I think she did."</p> <p>"Do you think you might want to know again?"</p> <p>"Of course I want to know, but I don't know just how," I answered.</p> <p>"How do you think I mean?" she asked, her voice soft. * * *</p> <p>The first time, after having to be careful when we did it, I fucked her best that first week, and she fucked me the second and then, a different way that day as we went to church, and I fucked her while she put on a show.</p> <p>We did it at two in the afternoon, I was lying on the sofa in front of the fireplace, naked, she sitting next to me. We just sat there, looking down at each other while we kissed, and looked at each other. And then we turned to the sofa, and she lay down on her back, with her legs wide apart, and I slid back, looked at her pussy, and then slid the cock in, fucked her and kissed her again.</p> <p>Then we came. I'm not sure how, or when, but when she had her second orgasm and her pussy clenched and unclenched around my cock, her arms around me, I just kept fucking her.</p> <p>"Was it good?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, so nice," I said. "It was really good."</p> <p>"It was the best fuck in ages." A third orgasm followed.</p> <p>"It's not your time then," I said.</p> <p>"You didn't ask. You know the old saying, just when you're ready to be, and it says in all seriousness: 'Just lay still.'</p> <p>"It certainly seemed to me, after those two orgasms."</p> <p>"How does next Sunday?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, I'm not sure. What you are saying is just a thought; it's the best fuck in years, and all good to me."</p> <p>"I lay still and she kissed and held her. we came and I still kissed. I kept and sat again, and they kissed we talked.
