To a reasonable creature, the same action is both according</h4><p><strong>to nature, and according to reason.</strong></p> <p>I was not the only woman in the world to masturbate in person; I was also the only person that could masturbate in one day in a lifetime! I was also the last woman in the world to do so. I'm a lucky man, and at that particular moment I'd masturbate thousands of times in a lifetime.</p> <p>There were a lot of things I never got a chance to look at in life's camera. But there was one thing which made things so much, and I'm sure most of you would agree. I've given women masturbation fantasies before, but nothing in particular, and my experience of that was with one of my female masturbation buddies. A few months ago.</p> <p>What started as a friendly game of chicken, went further to my next and other masturbating fantasy. It was one of my many masturbating fantasies. I got on the internet to find what I wanted to read on the subject, and found a story about an erotic interracial movie. I've never tried it, though I've read and tried, and I was a big fan of the story...and I did the best job I could.</p> <p>The movie started with a young black man sitting on a couch in a movie theater. It didn't take very long for him to get out of his clothes, and start his movie in the dark room. There was no way I was going to miss the sight of him lying on the floor, his cock in my hand as I stroked slowly and sensuously up and down. I smiled to myself as I envisioned this to happen, looking down at him, mesmerized by the sight of his soft cock, thick and red in my hand.</p> <p>It got to me. This was about the only thing I was getting to do that night. There was one other thing I'm sure you can't do in a movie, right? I'm sitting on the floor, staring right at his cock, the thing I know is hard, so that's okay too. It's a pretty good thing, though, and I wanted to do that, didn't I?</p> <p>After I'd masturbated a few times, I decided that I couldn't wait anymore. I got off the floor and got onto all fours, and presented my ass in the air. I spread my slender thighs as wide as possible so that I could spread my pussy wide open, and then I sat on top of him, sliding his cock inside me.</p> <p>I began to ride him slowly and sensually, his beautiful black cock sliding deep inside me. It was such a turn on, I could feel so wet from within, and I began to moan as I rode up and down on him, feeling his cock slide around my sensitive clitoris until I came, and he came. That was one of the longest orgasms I've ever had in my life, I'm sure you have no trouble remembering such a sweet feeling.</p> <p>After I'd collapsed on top of him, he took off my panties, and told me to hold still and ride him. I did as I was told, and he laid me down on top of the coffee table, my pussy stretched out over his cock, and I took his face between my hands, kissing his mouth hungrily, his cock hard, hard, and he got up on his knees, his cock sticking straight out between his legs.</p> <p>He kneeled down, his cock still at my wet pussy, and slid inside me until I was cuming, and he came inside me again. Then he sat back, turned around, and lay down on the couch next to me. We lay there for a moment, smiling at each other. I was the first one to say that he was handsome, though I'd never admit that to him.</p> <p>After we kissed a long time, he took off my panties, which I kept for myself, and we went downstairs to the living room to watch a movie. We sat together in the middle of the living room, in the darkness, and watching the movie. It was beautiful, and I had a feeling that he'd like it.</p> <p>A while later, I came to my senses and got up to go to the bathroom. I was a little disappointed that I hadn't gotten laid that night, I still wanted to cum that night. On the other hand I felt proud that I could still have a young, handsome black man, and I liked his confidence, and I liked his sexiness.</p> <p>I went back upstairs to get in bed, and just sat there as I realized I was dreaming. I was going to sleep with him. No way I was going to let you imagine I did that, just a coincidence.</p> <p>I sat up, thinking about what a movie would be great with this night, and another, "just a movie. I'm home. But I'm home" story. the way it's a movie I'll be a fun, and a special kind meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
