It was a little while before I started the project and it made for a really great one, however little there was to do with it. It was only the construction on the roof that was still going on as a result of the construction on the roof. When I was building the project, I had to make sure the place was ready to accept new clients. I didn't even know if this meant the construction was still coming to completion until late last weekend.</p> <p>I've got a whole project to take care of. I hope it doesn't involve too much of a project, but I do not blame anyone for asking me.</p> <p>Mr. Lloyd:</p> <p>I spent one more night out with Abbot before we retired to our room to continue the project. I guess he really did have a thing for Bessie and what she does. Abbot made the entire thing about her, as much about her as I thought. In that case, maybe I should go get some sleep for a couple of hours.</p> <p>We'd been in bed for about an hour when Abbot got in between us and started kissing me and rubbing me between my legs. I was still a little apprehensive about what this could mean, as Abbot had done to me with his tongue earlier in the week. It made me feel good to have some more of his tongue available to play around with, but I really needed to finish the work I'd already completed. Abbot's tongue explored every inch of my pussy before going down to swirl around my clit. It made me tremble and I started kissing his shoulder. Mr. Lloyd said that he liked Abbot on the project and he had some stories about Bessie and herself. I thought I'd better do another one soon to get his attention as well.</p> <p>Abbot spent a little while licking my clit before inserting a finger into my pussy. I'm pretty tight. It's not the end-all of the story but I'm sure it's not quite so bad. Maybe not completely hygienic, but I think it's much better than I could ever have imagined.</p> <p>While Abbot pumped his finger in and out, I put my hand on Abbie's cock. I started sliding it up and down, rubbing the head against my clit or even my labia. It looked big in Abbie's little hand. I couldn't believe it had gotten in this big. I was still worried about what Abbie would think when he saw what I had done with Abbie's dick.</p> <p>I got Abbie to lie down and spread his legs. Without taking his cock, I put the swollen helmet at the opening of my pussy and slowly pushed just the thing into me.</p> <p>"Oh!" I moaned as the dick that was in me stretched my love canal out. I felt like heaven.</p> <p>I didn't know what it would feel like inside me. Abbie's cock had stretched out a bit, as well, because my pussy wasn't quite ready for something as big as his member. I could feel Abbie's fingers rubbing my bottom as I worked up and down. He started going a little faster and I started to move back against him a little. There was more lubrication there than there was on his dick so Abbie's fingers found it too. It felt so good.</p> <p>The feelings were great, but I'm really going to need to cum. Abbie's cock was in me so far that I expected his balls to come out of his body some time today, but I wasn't disappointed. He was pushing it all the way into me and he wasn't pulling out at all. He was fucking me as I rode him and I don't think he ever stopped. He got faster and harder and started pounding me harder and harder, pushing it as deep into me as it would go.</p> <p>"Ah, God!" I hollered as the orgasm hit me. It was like nothing I'd ever felt before - and just the right amount of pressure to make it even better. I'd never been cummed with my finger in me, as far as anyone had ever been.</p> <p>When Abbie started pushing it as far in as he could go and I felt his cock explode into me, his cock kept squirting into me and the cock in my pussy kept pumping while I came in wave after wave of pleasure. The whole process felt fantastic after that intense orgasm. Abbie kept pulling it out of me and I continued rubbing my clit until I was able to keep both my hands on Abbie's dick as well.</p> <p></p> <p>Mr. Lloyd got up and looked at me and asked, "I thought I thought he was going to try to put his dick back in Bess too, but he was still cum and ask Abbie was still pumping. He did that I asked—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
