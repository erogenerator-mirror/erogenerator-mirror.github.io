For in that they require nothing</strong>, nothing, it is merely an expression of what they want.</p> <p>The only way you can fuck when it pleases you is if it pleases you at all. And you can fuck, you can fuck, and you can fuck in any and all way.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"I feel good! I feel so good! I feel full! But I still need a bath!"</p> <p>I feel that this would be impossible. Even with the towel still on, or without the soap, there's no way I could ever have an orgasm without the towel. And when you have made it as clear as you can from experience, what's the point, I just need another bath?</p> <p>And I have two other ways to enjoy a nice summer's sexual rejuvenation. One to have you masturbate, preferably while rubbing yourself through your panties and panties, and then just as hard, you might slip them off so that you can pleasure one of your lovers.</p> <p>Which is why I feel so bad when I put my panties on: I just can't wait until we can have a nice romantic bath together!</p> <p>But for now, I'm going to have to get myself ready again in the bathroom, and then I'll call for the food. I need to prepare myself for dinner; it's the morning of another romantic evening.</p> <p>Once our breakfast is prepared and ready, I'll sit down naked in front of the fire, and pretend I'm cooking, while the bathroom is still a little while and I'm not paying much attention until the bathroom is fully lit up.</p> <p>And then when I'm done putting things away, I'll do my toilette so that I don't forget it.</p> <p>When my bath is completely filled in preparation for the dinner, I'll then take off the clothes that I'm wearing, and then just sit in front of my dresser and do my preparations.</p> <p>As I'm putting the things in the dish, I'll see a bottle of bubble bath oil to keep me occupied while I'm making up the dishes.</p> <p>When I wash my hands, they will be in the bath, while lying on the bed ready to be scrubbed.</p> <p>And then I'll just stay there and make myself beautiful after the bath, and then I'll look up before going out to the dining room in the morning.</p> <p>Oh, what a lovely idea, that's the idea I'd be having right now! There's no other way.</p> <p>*</p> <p>It's a miracle you haven't cum yet: this has to happen because it's a little earlier than a normal bath day, and then there's a lot of washing to do.</p> <p>This is how it feels so far: I'm washing my face and my hair, whilst my mind is occupied thinking of how great it feels to be naked, in front of my mirror.</p> <p>I can imagine running my fingers over my skin, slowly, as I slide my hands all over my body, until the feeling is just about constant, the feeling I've created with my fingers over my whole body.</p> <p>If I have a few moments, I'll then just hold the showerhead and start to spray myself and the shower until my face looks like a big splash of water.</p> <p>But if I have a few moments, I'll hold myself back by just letting my mind and body work itself, until I get tired of it.</p> <p>If I have a few moments, I'll let go and just let a little tension and anticipation build up, until I end up with a small orgasm, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to have more foreplay.</p> <p>If I have a few moments, I will let go and just let myself feel, to feel the pleasure that follows the experience, while I have a wonderful, exciting, arousing shower to follow.</p> <p>I'll hold myself, letting my fingers slide over my body, and as I'm so full of arousal, my breasts will be feeling so sensitive, that I'll start to tremble and my breasts will go soft and I'm just going to let myself go for a while.</p> <p>Then I'll just enjoy feeling the pleasure building up, until when there's nothing else in the world but pure pleasure...</p> <p>So it's just a matter of seconds before I just let myself go and let myself flow, like the flow in the garden...</p> <p>After I have some moments, I'll just let myself wash, to do the same shampoo in my hands, so that it's clear that it'll be washing, the same shampoo, so that I could just enjoy my shampoo.</p> <p>Then I'll get up and wash my hair, without even knowing what I'd say or think.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You've got to come'n't you getn'tn'tn't go just</p> <p>(you n't not</p> <p>don't n'tâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
