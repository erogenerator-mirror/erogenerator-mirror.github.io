A Conjugal Scene</h4><p><strong>At the Place Louis XV. the three young people separated—that is to say, Morrel went to the Boulevards, Château-Renaud to the Pont de la Révolution, and Debray to the Quai.</strong> Morlen had the most romantic moment of his young life.</p> <p>Debray was so beautiful. He thought she was the most beautiful thing I ever laid my eyes on, if her name was to be known. He had never been with a woman, not really. He did his father's business and taught for a living, before joining the military.</p> <p>His father, Alou, loved it. She had looked stunning when she returned to France on vacation. She was in pretty good shape for someone her age, just right. Her skin was flawless. Her blue-black hair cascaded over, and she possessed an enormous pair of boobs for a woman his size or smaller, but they were absolutely spectacular.</p> <p>He did indeed think the world should be laughing, but that wasn't exactly what he had been telling himself. After all, she was the most beautiful creature he ever laid his eyes on, and he knew it.</p> <p>The two of them returned to the Palais du Mansais. He sat in the big-town hotel room that his grandmother used to own.</p> <p>Sally walked out of the bathroom with a huge diamond ear-ring dangled from each of her earrings. He'd love to be able to stare at her beautiful face when he got off work, but his mind was elsewhere.</p> <p>She smiled at him as he sat on the bed. "I've got a gift you can't wait to unwrap," she said. She kissed her way down his chest, past his navel, and to his crotch. He was fully erect, standing stiff and proud above his thick, uncircumcised penis. She grabbed his ballsac and stroked him gently, while licking and kissing her way down his throbbing member.</p> <p>Her tongue flittered the tip of his cock head, just a little, and he squirmed with sexual excitement. For his 18 year old body, she was an absolutely spectacular lover. And her incredible mouth was so unbelievably delicious it was almost as if she had two separate bodies, each one aching to be joined in carnal bliss, too.</p> <p>The tip of his cock entered her mouth. She immediately went back to work.</p> <p>"God," he moaned as he watched her deepthroat her way down. He felt her throat moving as she took him into her mouth. Her hands worked furiously on his ballsack, massaging them while licking his shaft all the way down to his tight, puckered asshole.</p> <p>As if she were a professional, she massaged his ballsack while sucking his cock, giving him the kind of deepthroat that only French dames know how to get. His hands gripped the sheets, and he was moaning loudly as she alternated between licking his cock and balls and sucking his cock. He grabbed her hands and pulled them from her clit and placed them on her head, holding it in place as she licked and slurped, while working her tongue expertly all the way up to the crown.</p> <p>"Oh, God," he groaned deeply. He couldn't really feel him thrusting in and out, but that did not matter anymore because as soon as he thought he was going to cum, his muscles tensed up, and his hot, boiling seed flooded the back of her throat. She swallowed his load as much as she could, but some cum leaked out the corner of her mouth and leaked down his balls.</p> <p>She swallowed the entire load, while licking her lips. She looked up at him, and he could see that he'd gotten away. She rose to her knees and took hold by member, stroking it hard while looking out the window.</p> <p>"It's time for me to go," she said. He stood, still erect, so she could get up from her knees, but he didn't make it. He was already walking the corridor to his flat.</p> <p>To this day, he thinks that was the highlight of his life. They were on a date in Spain in March. She had invited him to the party—he was invited—and they had arranged to have dinner with his mother on a Saturday. He'd been expecting his mother to be out late, but apparently she was the one who asked. What he didn't expect was for her to take a walk on his beachfront property.</p> <p>"That's a date," she giggled. "You want to buy new carpets to hang up your stuff?"</p> <p>"Please," he said, his voice barely a whisper, even though that she was still a whisper.</p> <p>"Why don't be sure, I'm going out in that day, why I think you'd feel you haven't feel good, you ready for me so," she whispered I'll still feel good again."</p> <p></p> <p>"I got to go see. Don't want to do. see my—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
