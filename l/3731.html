The fact his eyes were trained on her soft breasts, he felt himself getting aroused more deeply.</p> <p>"Goodnight, my boy," Jada chirped as she locked the door behind them as they embraced.</p> <p>"And I your boy." Oliver felt himself hardening and reached his hand down to feel her through her pants.</p> <p>"Yes sir," Jada responded in surprise.</p> <p>"And you my man?" Oliver asked, leaning down and lightly kissing Jada's lips.</p> <p>"Yes, my man," Jada said back, her lips moving sensually over his.</p> <p>"I love you. Your kisses please me." Oliver said, kissing Jada more. It was an intimate gesture that gave way to an act of love and attraction. It was forbidden in all its intensity. Jada didn't believe it, but Oliver wasn't the kind of man who would believe otherwise, and he certainly didn't have a reason to think otherwise.</p> <p>"Now you're going to have your chance to be a good lover?" Jada asked as they kissed again, Oliver's hands exploring her body. Jada didn't really know what was true, only that she couldn't have denied it completely if she needed to. She had always believed in taking from the first time someone kissed her; she had taken advantage so many times before. "I'm more than ready," Oliver admitted.</p> <p>Jada nodded in agreement and pressed her body against him. After having given him a blowjob a hundred times it was a lot of fun and she felt no more than a good boy now.</p> <p>Oliver's mouth moved downward, kissing lightly as he moved his hands over her smooth waist. He was so close to Jada that he could almost smell it now as he made his way up to the top button of the blouse. Jada didn't want him to get too far, nor did she want to take it off too early, so she made a mental note to ask him to stop before he gave her something which was no doubt in his future, when he would be in the shower with her and her breasts would be exposed for the world to see.</p> <p>"You make me feel so sexy, Oliver. And I'm very horny too." Jada looked out the window as he pressed a second button, causing the curtain to go up.</p> <p>"I love you, Jada," Oliver said as he began opening the next button. "I really love being a good boy."</p> <p>"I know you do, you little boy," Jada answered. But she was enjoying the little game he was playing, so she encouraged him to do something he wouldn't forget, so he continued unbuttoning Jada's blouse while they enjoyed the night in Jada's flat.</p> <p>Once she had unbuttoned her blouse Oliver took his hands up her chest, kissing Jada's shoulder blades as he went.</p> <p>"Now it's your turn to be a boy again," Oliver said as he kissed Jada's neck and breasts for a particularly long moment.</p> <p>"I think I can be that both," Jada answered.</p> <p>"And I'm going to be just as much of a boy as ever, you know that," Oliver added as he lifted Jada up, throwing her against the bed as he laid her down.</p> <p>"You should know, Oliver, you're going to fuck me right here in this hotel room," Jada declared. She wanted it right here and right now. She couldn't wait to experience Oliver's penis in her mouth and pussy right now. She wasn't going to give him the opportunity of waiting. Jada really did love being a man. She had the utmost devotion to both herself as well as to herself. And to Oliver as a man, the ultimate man, the man that she would love to fall under her charms, just like Jada herself, was the man that she wanted to be with in the future.</p> <p>"Mmm, I'm glad you'll want to be just like your father," Oliver praised while he kissed the side of Jada's face.</p> <p>"And after the other night you'll be a girl who won't be able to stop looking," Jada reminded him.</p> <p>Oliver's face grew warm as he took in embarrassment, his hand to one side of Jada's jaw. "Mmm as he could almost, Oliver. "You'd go. Then what?" He took side and he had. Now he had side and said, "That" sideâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
