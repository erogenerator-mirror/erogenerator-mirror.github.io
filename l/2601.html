And because the Soveraignty is either in</strong> the same Realm or in the same County, we usually know where we want to be - or how to be - when we want to be. Our bodies will take care of a few details, so let's begin. A couple of questions we need to learn are how to eat. If I could, I'd eat in the kitchen while you get into the bed. That would be nice, but no one will need to know - in fact, we'll save some time by just coming in the bed, before you're ready to go to sleep. If someone's already in the bed with you, I'll wake you up - and we can start talking."</p> <p>Kylani smiled and shook her head. "Yes, Captain, I'm not prepared! I've been practicing and I think we've got something very different here. How do you feel?"</p> <p>"I love it!" I said, feeling a little better. "What's next? What's my next position? Can we go over to the bed?"</p> <p>"I think we can make an entire house - for just one day, before you're ready to move inside the bedroom." Kylani said.</p> <p>"And it will be my bed - not yours." I assured her. "Now why don't you come out and let me get undressed." I said, walking with her to the bedroom. In between the bed and the mirror, I looked in to see Kylani standing in front of me, nude, wearing some kind of fancy dress shirt, that was so short it might as well have been one of those little skirts I'd seen in catalogs.</p> <p>"We're going to make a huge house, sir!" I said, walking towards the bed, and Kylani, seeing that I was naked, giggled and gave me a big kiss.</p> <p>"I'm not so sure we've got the time for us..." I started, trying to think of something to say. "I think we know that we have to come together - for every day we have the chance - to be in the same thing."</p> <p>We both laughed, and then moved towards the bed. Kylani lay down, with spread legs, and I climbed up next to her. She rolled over and pulled me down on her. "Now get into bed!" I instructed.</p> <p>"Yes, sir!" she said, smiling.</p> <p>Now you can start the whole conversation by saying you know this will be our private relationship, but there is something I want to do to you. I was on my knees behind her, looking down at her beautiful ass, when I leaned down to kiss it. "Are you sure you want to do this?" I asked, as I slowly worked my tongue all around her anus, to see if she was OK.</p> <p>"Very sure!" she said, "and if you're ready, now you can start by licking me!"</p> <p>When I started on her clit, she got up on her elbows and looked over the side of the bed... She was leaning more backwards than forward. From a distance, I could tell by the way she was moving - she was getting off on my tongue, and the fact that she was trying to get off herself. I looked over to the other side and could see that she's doing the same.</p> <p>At the same time, Kylani looked at me... her eyes looked into mine... "Can I do the same for you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure!" I said, and leaned forward. I ran my tongue across her clit once more, and she started moaning, "Oh my god, just don't stop!" with two fingers jammed into her asshole. When her orgasm hit her, she had her hands on my head and was pushing me closer to her, so I grabbed her ass cheeks and pulled her onto my face, trying to feel my tongue deeper within her.</p> <p>"I haven't been fucked in so long!" Kylani whispered.</p> <p>"A long time," I replied with a smile. With each successive second, she let out a long sigh. I continued licking until her orgasm had finished. I could feel her muscles tensing up a little, and then tightening as she came, holding onto my face so tight as I could pull free.</p> <p>"Oops!" she said, pushing out from under me into the air, with her breasts jiggling as she did so. "God, that was some mouth work!"</p> <p>"And my finger really was in you, as well" I replied, licking her pussy again.</p> <p>"You know," she said smiling, "we can do this every day if we want."</p> <p>"And we could still do it, for each other women, to each other men," I added. a third voice came back.</p> <p></p> <p>.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"No, please let's my tongue!
