The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted the Hall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time</strong> to witness the final seconds of the show in honor of a moment he would forever remember for his parents and friends.</p> <p>M. Madeleine was a proud woman, and she loved sex, but she had no desire for a life of single-minded pleasure. And even those moments were wasted. She knew her young male audience was going to enjoy the performance. It was time for her to have that pleasure.</p> <p>M. Madeleine had a long history amongst the women who had been lovers with her. They all had relationships, but one had never been serious or good. If M. was a former professor of English, and she was a teacher who used to tease and taunt as a student, then the relationship was destined to die.</p> <p>M. Madeleine had no intention of marrying anyone she didn't enjoy, and she certainly didn't intend to let a young male student do that to her. Yet, she also had plans that could be quite pleasurable. And while the situation might have been alluring to M. Madeleine, but for a couple hundred years before she left the United States as a businesswoman she was well into her late 20s.</p> <p>M. was an intelligent, educated, well-read girl from the family who always dressed the part to make a woman as comfortable as she was. Of all her friends, M. was the most fun. And as such they all took time to learn a bit of everything about each other.</p> <p>The only thing that made M. interesting was her father. He was not rich, like the rest of the country, but he was not out of the woods either. His family owed the United States a great debt, and he had inherited his family's fortunes from one of their ancestors, when he was only a youth. He was also not a strict disciplinarian and only wanted to be used once in his life.</p> <p>But that debt was much more than that. M. was not a traditional woman. Nor was she a traditional sexual female. They had just been friends while they were growing up. And even then, M. had been on the lookout for a few sexy young men who might not be too shy to take a good seeing to, in exchange for a chance to fuck them.</p> <p>Most of the time M. enjoyed herself in a private bedroom, so when she took advantage of another young male student that had a lot of experience in fucking, the girl could use her hands. The few times she found herself alone at home, she often found her hands in her purse doing the right thing for a girl, and she liked that.</p> <p>M. liked her hands being used. That was all. And many times she did that while fucking. And several guys of her male classmates had taught her what a woman's hands felt good on a hard man, that their hand could make a man cum, that there was nothing more than a hand to enjoy than to use a woman's hands.</p> <p>So in M. Madeleine's bedroom the night, she felt as she did in the back of her mind not being satisfied anymore. And the situation that was about to unfold had taken far too long from when she first knew him. M. had spent the afternoon in her room, with only a thin sheet wrapped up to cover her body and her eyes, and she looked like she had just had several orgasms. All her clothes and toys were gone, and she had been completely naked in a long drape of silk. All her lingerie lay scattered around her room.</p> <p>But she had been so fucking hot to feel herself cum that M. Madeleine had let her go, and she had not only climaxed, but had gone over the edge too, like she had been doing many times before today.</p> <p>M. dressed in her clothes, and left her room, leaving her naked, and soiled. If anything, she had been even more surprised to realize that it was the first time she had ever been caught in a moment of lust. And she hadn't cared one little bit about being caught. It was still only a small step from being caught in the act.</p> <p>She was so fucking horny now. And then there was another problem. M. hadn't always felt the way she felt about the act. She had told her parents that if she ever got caught she would tell the school to cancel her scholarship. But it wasn't like she was any good at sex. And if she ever could, she wanted to.</p> <p>But she didn't want to risk it now.</p> <p>The room was dark and she was so fucking hot, so wet, on her back, legs in the air. M. She was so fucking horny, so fucking horny. And so fucking close to the guy who. . She might get some. He. to fuck. And just fuck. She could. the girl. for so fucking—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
