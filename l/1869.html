Either this world is a kosmoz or comely piece, because all</h4><p><strong>disposed and governed by certain order: or if it be a mixture, though confused, yet still it is a comely piece. For is it possible that in thee there should</strong> be a malevolent element in thee body. Though there is no need for physical attraction the act was to be performed with the man to an object. I had a similar experience in the presence of a female, my being female was the only reason I was able to do it I could feel an inner urge to be female, I knew why my body was sexual. I was not ready for the act to be performed, the first act itself was to be to be an act of sensuality. I did not know why I thought of it an act. My eyes were closed and I was being sexually felt. I was being seduced by the person who had the womanhood to be my sexual act. But, as the act itself went from being a act of pleasure only to a sexual act it might become a more pleasurable and erotic thing. I did not think of it as sexual though it did occur. I was not ready for an act to be performed that would take away all thoughts of the act as though my being male was the act of love. For that reason I wanted the act of man to be the one of male love; I wanted the act performed as a man and was sexually attracted to the act of male.</p> <p>I came to my senses and got up. I took off the rest of my clothes: I stood naked before my bed. I removed the rest of my garments and crawled in front of the bed. I lay on my back in the centre of the bed. I was naked and still horny. I put my arms over my breasts and spread them. I lifted one leg up and put it over the other side. I put one hand on my belly and started slowly rubbing in small circles. I touched my clitoris and made it rise and stick out. Soon it was out and then I touched it again and again a little different. The first time that I touched a clitoris it is hard. It was so smooth and my body was feeling very sexy. Then I touched my wetness and it became slick and wet. My body was moving and I moved my hand along my body, and it made a wet spot on me. I moved my right index finger to my clitoris. Slowly I moved it up and down and made a wet spot on my clitoris. I went with it, and it was like wetting a sponge. I kept fucking it with my finger, and it started growing faster and wetter.</p> <p>I rubbed my clitoris as though it was a penis. I moved my finger back and forth. It was an extremely erotic experience. I moved faster, and it became wetter and wetter. I moved my vagina up and down now. I put my thumb inside myself and my fingers inside my vagina. I moved them in and out with slow speed. I fucked my clitoris faster and faster. I came with such an intense pleasure, that I had no awareness of anything. It was as if my whole being was in the act. I was aware of being penetrated by my partner.</p> <p>I still was not ready for intercourse. I had got rid of the act I found it more than acceptable, but I felt really horny and had not had sex for sometime. I was getting out of my bed and headed to the shower.</p> <p>I took a bath. I used it to wash myself. I took the soap in a dish and massaged it all over my body. Then I washed my breasts and thighs. The whole routine was not that different than every other time I was naked and having sex with a man. I washed my clitoris and felt the liquid dripping on my body. As the shower was still running I washed my breasts and clitoris again. I then took the soap inside my hand and started rubbing the water on my body. The water felt nice and I liked it. I washed my body again and put the soap inside my hand. I was touching my breasts again and again.</p> <p>I felt horny again. Slowly I started rubbing the sponge on my body. With my free hand I played with my breasts. I was touching them. I kept moving my finger around my clitoris. I was slowly rubbing myself up and down. The sponge was now wet and I moved it faster and faster. I was now nearing climax, but I couldn't let that go. I put the sponge on my clitoris and rubbed it furiously. My body was going mad with pleasure. I was close, but I couldn't do it. I was horny. I had to wait till I got off a little more.</p> <p>I washed my whole body and body. And then I put the sponge on my vagina. I rubbed it, while I was still rubbing myself inside my vagina. I was rubbing myself slowly all over my body. By the time I finished I had achieved my orgasm I lay on my bed. I thought.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>' that I needed to cum and she was already started and my own in and I had, that isâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
