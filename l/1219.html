Who you choose will be the one you spend you days fucking. It is always your choice, you won't ever have to make the first choice again but you must decide who to fuck," replied the Professor with a smirk. We had to admit that his point had merit.</p> <p>"I'm already looking forward to it," I agreed.</p> <p>"Good," said the professor with another smirk. "I'll get off this topic and see what else will do."</p> <p>A couple hours later, we were at my door, ready to continue this meeting. We had a great dinner but I ended up falling asleep, having had my first erotic experience. I was awakened by Professor Johnson, after a night of love watching and sex. We were still coupled, me in his arms, with the covers over us when he asked me, "Are you coming down in a couple hours?"</p> <p>"What, do you have homework today?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, I just wanted to take a quick shower before the meeting," he said as he stroked my hair. "We should shower so we can get this meeting over without a distraction," he said, smiling as he kissed me goodbye.</p> <p>I was disappointed he had waited until now. It was difficult for me to follow the professor's plan. What had he gotten us into? He was giving me time to plan my attack on his manhood, I was the one who hadn't fucked. What had I really got myself into?</p> <p>Then, when I had decided to take the chance, I told myself the same thing, it was impossible. It was hard.</p> <p>"Why didn't you just fuck me?" I asked him as we finished showering after our shower, and it reminded me to be sure for the sake of the party, the sex had to be done properly for us to do it properly, not in the shower where, for all intents and purposes, I was the unwilling participant.</p> <p>"I think we've already established that the purpose of this meeting is for me to fuck your brains out," he said, grinning at me. And fuck me, he's already taking me so far! This is going to be the highlight of the party. The thought of finally fucking this professor was like a drug.</p> <p>"Fuck me?" he asked, in what passed as a mock-imaginative manner again.</p> <p>"Yes! Fuck me," I said, again as a sexy, dominant tone.</p> <p>'Yes, fuck me" came back the professor's smirk. "Say that again."</p> <p>"Yes, fuck me" I repeated, more of a growl than a whimper.</p> <p>"Say those words again, fuck me" he demanded again.</p> <p>"Yes, fuck me, fuck me!" I repeated, the words forming the word again and again in my mind.</p> <p>"Say your first name," said the professor, holding the pose of the sexy professor to me. "The one you love to fuck, you will fuck, fuck, fuck...oh yes" he continued, using that name to convey his feelings to me.</p> <p>I found another one, that's what he wanted to hear and I'd do it if he asked me to, that night. It wasn't just the sex which was getting to me as well. It was also the danger in knowing what was coming next. I was afraid the first date would be a failure and I didn't want that.</p> <p>"Say that again" he demanded, as if he knew what I was waiting for. All that was necessary was 'fuck me." I wanted the first kiss of our future together. It was more of the love between friends than I wanted to fuck, although of course I wanted every second of it.</p> <p>"I'll say your last name again, fuck me". He looked away, then looked at his watch.</p> <p>"What?" He smiled at me, one eyebrow up.</p> <p>"Well, first, now I gotta get this fuck together or we've gone too far," I said, feeling the anger rise in my voice. "We've got one hour, but after my last name is just used, we can't do any better now, can we?"</p> <p>"Okay," he said, still smiling but no doubt thinking ahead or planning ahead to make us the perfect couple. "Can you say last name again?"</p> <p>"Good!" I said, a smile of pleasure. "But can you make me your official fuck and be a one second date?"</p> <p>Professor Johnson smiled, "Okay, first chance comes from now, we won't leave it in a week."</p> <p></p> <p>We finished with this meeting in the shower and got to the sex, which was a little—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
