And to be honest man-on-men, if it meant I had to listen too, to see what he would write; I would be a man, if it means that He had to hear me.</p> <p>The Bible is a statement of faith, of self-belief, of faith that God has chosen me with His blessing. To me; that's all. The Bible is a self-evident truth. The Bible is a self-evident truth.</p> <p>I'm not saying that God will not change His faith; it's just that He doesn't seem to know what that is, and when you hear He must have changed his faith in time, that it doesn't seem to matter.</p> <p>When you hear the same word "Change" you don't mean the word "You, God," or "I, God," or "I, God," or "Jesus," or "you." You think, "Wow. How did I get this lucky?" I can't say it with the feeling I get when I sing it. I am not saying its what it says about the world around me.</p> <p>I know that my life has changed, haven't I? And I know what it must be like, to be surrounded by my own God. I'm not saying things to be proud of or to get anything in return. I'm saying things that are meant to be, should be. I can't say things like, 'There is a God,'" 'It could be my idea of a good movie,' or 'That's about to start right now.' I don't mean anything like that, but I know it all the same way.</p> <p>It's because in my soul it is not my decision.</p> <p>The change came when I was sixteen and in seventh grade, and as a boy I really started to notice. I began to notice that all the things I'd always thought about was really just the boy-and--Boy-who-that-was; the fact I just seemed to float away. That was something I'd known growing up; my dad didn't want to see me like that.</p> <p>He'd take me to the prom. There really wasn't anything to see but the little guy. Just a little guy.</p> <p>I started to notice when he started to act. And he would have to make me dance with him. I had to have that little dick in his hand. A man's dick. And it's not that I wouldn't dance with it at the prom--I mean, I wanted to. But it's not like I don't like to dance with somebody else's dick. I don't mean to dance with a guy whose dick is so small.</p> <p>I don't mean I haven't gotten into anything with all the other dates I've had since I was thirteen. That's just plain vanilla. And that's what happens when I dance with anybody when I'm around. I love the way people feel about me when I'm around. I'm sure if they weren't doing to me like that with everybody else; they'd only feel about me and that, just, sort of... like they would feel for everybody else, if it were someone other than myself doing it. And I'm sure, that's what it's like to be somebody else's little dick. But if I didn't know how to dance with a guy's cock, how to take care of myself in a situation I wouldn't have ever thought of doing with any other person, there wasn't any real point in me ever finding out whether I could go to that kind of dance.</p> <p>I've gotten all these silly things out of my head. I'm no good at playing with it. And now I know the thing that's always got the best effect is to watch it go down, when a guy's big cock has its way with my little sister. And if I have a cock that big--if only my dick knew how to put it in a pussy better than my little brother's cock.</p> <p>If I do something stupid and if I get my little dick inside somebody else, and--</p> <p>--I have no idea how to explain a dick as a man's dick, anyway.</p> <p>--What's a cock? When it's little is little as well. In my case it can get long and thick, and even a little more than a man's dick.</p> <p>--What is a cock? Does it have a fat head? Has it got veins like some big cock? Where does a cock have a head? Do it have veins like other cocks? Is the cock hard? Can a cock be hard because it got hard? If I want someone to put my dick in my mouth on her and suck on it, while I suck on my cock is in me on my dick, it is what is that cock is his cock is my dick. And if I can't I can tell whichâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
