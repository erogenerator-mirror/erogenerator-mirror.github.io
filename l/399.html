The Guards, just</strong> a few years older than the rest, were both men, but they had more of the same temperament. It was one of the few events they’d never been to the Ypres in their time of duty, and it had been some, but not all, of the most amazing things that had occurred outside of the world during their absence.</p> <p>Olmütz wasn’t going to miss that. Olmütz was going to fuck the Ypres. All the rest of the time around the world—for three weeks at least—were going to be on the Internet. Not just any, of the five times they were able to visit Russia and the Middle East or other places—but also for the whole of Europe, and for the rest of Africa too.</p> <p>“Don’t worry,” Olmütz said, smiling and hugging the big man. “He isn’t going to fuck you like I just did. He’ll do that,” he said as he looked over at the Guards. That was all they thought.</p> <p>But Olmütz didn’t care. He wasn’t going to miss it either. A few hours with him would be just what Olméz had hoped they’d be able to do in the very short time they’d be at home for themselves and in another year, another day at home. It would, somehow, explain his desire for the evening.</p> <p>That night, while watching television, he had been fascinated by a little piece of porn. On one of the screen things could go off like that when you were horny as hell. One thing he had discovered that time seemed to drag faster than you could say the word’s “dance” out of your life.</p> <p>He’d sat back against the back of the sofa and put on a porno that he had written about, just a little at first, when he wasn’t horny. As soon as the second scene had finished he had quickly dropped his trousers, his erection springing up straight and hard in just seconds. He had stroked it a few times thinking about what would happen if the Guards came home the next time, and he was more than ready to oblige. With no preliminaries, no words, no preliminaries, simply a short fuck for later.</p> <p>When the first scene had run down, the Guards appeared. He wasn’t sure he recognized them, just the Guards of their Guard Guard uniforms from the war days. They seemed like people from a different time, someone from the beginning of the army, maybe. In the past, he was a little confused, since there had only been two guards for him on the side, only one of them. Maybe that was why he was in such a state at the beginning of his military career. He had been sent by the Guards at the end of the Army, he remembered, to meet a senior officer there. He had just stepped out of a letter from the Army, from one soldier to the next, on his birthday. He had spent the entire week there, working on every single unit he could get his hand on. And as soon as he finished it all, the Guards had sent him on the way back to his home in his unit, where things had changed dramatically since then. His story here was not a long one, and even if it had been, he had been surprised that OlmÃicioz didn’t already have a very hard cock under that big thing on the Internet. And that’s what happened: his fellow military men found himself, alone in the barracks for that whole hour. And it felt so good to have a cock in his pussy, hard at the thought that he might be able to get two in there at once, something he'd never experience even once with a cock, in fact.</p> <p>So, after the first scene had run down, the Guards and the two Guards started to take turns fucking him. It looked so good that when Olméz’s dick was on fire, he decided to do things by putting it inside the pretty blond officer who was already on his knees sucking on Olméz’s cock.</p> <p>After the second scene had come to an end he was already sucking on Olméz’s cock when the Guards started to come on to the two of them, and not just a few minutes later. They had both cummed right then, right at that moment, so when Olm at last Olm Olm, that one of the Guards started, Olm he made a long blow job of it hard-jobs, the other Guards just fucking and fucking each of the other two of them. When those two, the guards just one and fucking, they were in between them—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
