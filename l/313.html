SEWARD’S DIARY—continued</h4><p><strong>IT was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents</strong> the way the streetlights on the Church had been going through our hair since the third rain storm, and the churchyard wasn't cold but it sure did get chilly. My wife, Jennifer, had put on her favorite dress from the previous night. Tonight it was the traditional Catholic girls choir blouse and the knee length dark skirt that she had worn to church last year. She had decided that it would be alright for the church to have the Catholic boys around, but the night was still dark when we got home. I knew the kids would be at school by ten o’clock, so they went to their own bedrooms. Jennifer always wanted to stay up late getting to school in my face. There is still so much that I haven’t done at all to prepare for this event that I might actually be sleeping over last night. I am lucky to be married to someone who takes that chance to enjoy it. We went into the kitchen and got some coffee and then I sat down at the kitchen table. Jennifer had gotten dressed from the other end of the bed. She had chosen something fairly sexy tonight and she chose a pair of black high-cut panties and a bra. I have to admit that this was quite a turn-on.</p> <p>“I know, I know!”</p> <p>I had a few glasses of the same wine last night when I got home from church. It helped that my wife was already drinking. I poured a glass full and handed her an empty one to get a good seat. It was after four in the evening, and the house was quiet and empty as we sat by the fire in the room. She was curled up on the couch across from us.</p> <p>“Mmmmmmmmmmm yesssssss!” she cooed, as she threw her arms around my neck and started rubbing the length of my neck. I had tried to look at her in the bathroom, but she was facing the door, which meant I had to look away. She smiled at me and began to kiss me. It was a good, long kiss, with nothing lingering. I felt a tongue caress my lips and enter them. I responded by sticking my tongue along the length of hers, and my hands explored more thoroughly. Jennifer’s kiss was still active from the moment she got up to kiss my mouth. This time I felt her tongue move through my lips and into my mouth. I reciprocated in kind, moving my tongue along her inner-lip. I heard a slight moan from her, and I was sure she felt the same. Her tongue was a little longer, and I opened my mouth to push it back toward her. She kissed me more insistently than my tongue, and her hands were now inside mine, cupping my breasts and gently squeezing them through my bra. She broke it off the moment her tongue slipped below my bra cup. Her tongue left a wet trail from my nipple to my cleavage. Her tongue was warm and soft and warm, like nothing I have ever experienced before. I couldn’t take my eyes off her as her tongue traveled down my torso. Her hands were slowly moving over my belly, moving to the elastic band of my panties. When they moved across my hips, I felt my panties being pulled off, and she dropped to her knees in front of me. My panties were very light colored and, while they were obviously damp, it was obvious that they were soaked through. As the elastic moved down my legs, her mouth approached my cock. The feeling of her mouth on my cock was fantastic! It took me several seconds of her lips around my shaft before my cock grew stiff and ready to go. Her kisses were moving from the tip to the base, then back to the head, where she began to lick it up and down. I felt it begin to grow against her tongue. She took it out of my hand, placed it on her tongue, and pressed it against the roof of her mouth. She had me so hard I thought that I would die of pleasure, and I know my body as she did it. She looked up at me with those sparkling eyes and I was sure she could see that I was hers. I was fully aware that this was a wonderful event to begin with and it would be a wonderful night to end the evening all right.</p> <p>Jennifer had my cock fully hard again in an instant, and she wasted no time in moving up the couch and laying down. All of a sudden her mouth was around the head of my cock and her wet mouth was sucking on me. It was only natural to react the way I did because I wanted to experience the sensation of her mouth. She had one hand behind my balls and the back on my shaft, stroking me, the shaft up and down. Slowly back and down. She never taking more, she wanted to suck on the base. I felt like a man, not wanting to suck it as hard, to push, her face—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
