He was sure that I would not need any of this. We didn’t. We were now very much alone. Our little table was set up in our living room with a lamp. He took the chair back away from his side of the room. I could now see clearly the rest of the house. From the dining room, he saw that the sofa was set, and the window seat was set in the far corner. He got up from the chair and began undressing himself. It was already after twelve. He had a cigarette. He put the cigarette in his mouth and set the lighter at a low speed, and leaned back onto the chair. He lay back, and I began slowly undressing. He was already naked. I knelt at his feet and put both hands on his legs, sliding the straps off his shoes and then taking each shoe off of him. I pulled his pants down. I had no idea how the whole affair took place, but I knew what I wanted. I wanted to feel his naked form there. He lay there waiting for me. He didn’t say a word. I took his cock into my face, and it felt as I had always imagined. I could smell the precum, but still didn’t want to use any kind of air freshener. I licked the length of the shaft, taking it in my mouth and licking it from base to tip. I held it in my hand and began moving my head up and down along it. We didn’t go any farther in or out of the mouth until we both were sure he had to be near. I got up and turned around, kneeling down and putting my ass at the edge. He got up behind me, and I moved the head of his cock under my ass cheek while I bent over. The head was at my opening, and I said,</p> <p>“Please enter my vagina with that big thing. Please.”</p> <p>He grabbed my hips, pushing the head of his cock against my anus. I took a deep breath in and exhaled it into his.</p> <p>“Okay love, fuck my vagina with that big penis “</p> <p>He placed the head against my hole and began working the length of his shaft. Slowly pushing it into me. I’m sure my vagina was being very still for him. It seemed to be taking forever to get it completely in, but eventually. I could feel it pushing into my pussy, which must have taken nearly half of it. I could feel my opening getting stretched, and then being engulfed by several inches of hard, hot flesh. My body was trembling and I could hear myself moaning and breathing fast. I felt him pushing into me some more, and then he was buried in me and he was moving in and out in rapid, deep strokes. “Faster lover”, I was saying like a girl, “fuck me, fuck me fast”, and I am sure I was saying the same words myself. Within a minute I felt him begin to moan, and his cock began shooting its load into me. I felt it, and the head of his cock began rubbing back and forth against my vagina, which I began squeezing tight against the head of his cock. We laid there for a moment, and each other. I could take nothing else. He took the hair away from my face and looked at me.</p> <p>“Did you like that?” I asked.</p> <p>“Oh yes,” said he, “I want to do more today.”</p> <p>I wanted to take his cock out of my pussy now, but for some reason, the feeling of his fingers against mine, the feel of his hard cock moving in and out, and the feeling at the bottom of my vagina, made me do it. I had the thought that even though I knew he didn’t want to do this, that he would probably do it again, maybe not tomorrow. He knew, though, that I wanted it, and that I wanted to feel his cock in me, and that I loved this. We got up slowly, and he got off of the sofa and walked across the room toward the door to his bedroom. When he came back, he put on a robe and sat on the couch. He took my hand and we walked across the room to the bedroom. When we reached the bed, he picked up the robe and we put it on the chair.</p> <p>“I know,” he told me, “all of that is up to you. You do whatever you want with me, and as long as you get the chance, let me use you. I don’ll do anything but you for right now, I will come in you.”</p> <p>’m. he left. ”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
