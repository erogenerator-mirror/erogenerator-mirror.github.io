She knew she'd made the wrong choice, and in truth she'd liked her decision too. But despite her own caution she hadn't let the matter interfere with the fun she'd had all this time. Her confidence soared when a particularly hot guy from home had taken pity on her.</p> <p>In one of the cabins there had been many a visit from this man, both single and in the presence of friends and family.</p> <p>The one they'd taken into the cabin for the night was a different kettle of water to the one in Lucy's cell. The man had fucked her like the sexiest slut she had ever known in the throes of passion in front of a roaring fire, and she had had the worst night of sex ever in her short, but equally beautiful life.</p> <p>In that one night she had been the aggressor. In fact, the evening had been a disaster for both of them, but it hadn't been her sexiest act in real life - she'd been too weak-hearted. On the contrary, her lovemaking for Lucy had been more intimate, but she was happy for her. She was happy for the guy.</p> <p>So while the man on offer in the room was a young guy with a massive cock, Lucy had gone in a different direction. She left him there alone while she returned to the next cabin, got it ready and then had sat down inside and watched him fuck the sleeping woman beside the water. She had been tempted by the prospect that she might not be able to go there with him, but she knew she wasn't allowed to do that, and even if she could, Lucy had chosen the next cabin.</p> <p>Then she had gone in the next night, not only so there wouldn't be other people in the room, but to watch a threesome. Lucy's inhibitions had waned a little as she'd watched and heard these two guys fuck. She had actually liked having the chance to get her husband to share his bed without all the men there in the room having to suffer the same fate that she had.</p> <p>The next night was on a Wednesday, and while Lucy knew that she should've decided to go to the next cabin rather than share it with him, she didn't.</p> <p>It was just as with the previous cabin, she and Michael had taken Lucy out into the evening. Michael was already up and out of his bed, going over to find some booze to quench his thirst.</p> <p>Then when Lucy had gone back to the cabin he had gone to the bathroom and found her, bent over the toilet seat as she had been, trying to catch her breath. Michael had stopped in surprise as he'd seen how gorgeous she was up close.</p> <p>Of course that hadn't been until she'd left the bathroom, not until she'd stood there, naked and shivering, but Lucy had wanted to have been there. She wanted to watch him, to be in her own bed with him.</p> <p>She remembered the look she'd gotten on her face when they'd entered the bedroom. When they'd kissed and moved towards each other, that time her eyes had had been big and wild, and when Lucy had felt so wicked and sexy and powerful and hot that she was ready to take on the roles as his lover and his slut in front of his eyes.</p> <p>Lucy had loved it, but she'd still remembered her face. She'd still wanted Lucy that much.</p> <p>Michael had felt the tingling deep within him. Lucy had felt him inside her. Of course she'd loved it, and had been a little nervous, too excited to wait for Lucy to ask him. He had felt his control starting to slip away again, but he knew that she'd wanted him too - she'd been too weak. But Lucy had loved it, had wanted it. And she'd said she loved it.</p> <p>Lucy was feeling the need to share it also. They'd had just finished the first of many rounds, making love in every corner of Michael's cabin, and now she'd wanted it, needed it - she'd been wet all through, and she wanted it even more now than before.</p> <p>Michael had watched as Lucy walked over to the open door, then followed her, and he had seen her bend over just as she'd bent over, looking into his eyes over her shoulder. For all her wild abandon she'd looked incredibly slutty. She'd obviously been turned on by the fact that Michael's big cock had been in her pussy, that he'd been fucking her in every corner of her room, and that it had been her in the hands that he'd been making her hold his cock as he had entered her every corner of his.</p> <p>bedroom. bedroom. He'd watched her as she'd wanked himself off one of his own prick—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
