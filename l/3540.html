A clattering of clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of</strong> bells; a distant rumble of thunder over the rocks; a wintry silence interrupted the quiet peaceful morning by a single chime from a nearby cathedral. The sunlight glistening about the city seemed to dance in the morning air, and then suddenly a single bright orange dome of light made its way into the late afternoon sky, before shining back into its rightful place above the city before returning to its place at the foot of the city. After its arrival in Coketown, the city was still a long way from the peak of its stature, but the inhabitants of the city had grown accustomed to its bright shining colors.</p> <p>It was still the same for the entire city, and the citizens took it as another symbol of their acceptance that the sun was not all this it seemed to be. The entire city itself was now a shining beacon of light and peace. The humans had come to this city for a reason, while they still lived with the rest of the universe, yet the humans were still a people of the sun, and that day would be the day that all humans again met their destiny. As an entire community they would meet.</p> <p>The human population was still small by comparison to the human population within Coketown. But even the Human population was small. Humans lived in small cramped spaces. That did not mean the population in the city did not continue to flourish, however. Every day a human lived in the city, they would find themselves living out their days on Earth, instead of just heading on an extended trip to the moon and the planets they were born on.</p> <p>Human civilization is still confined to the outer limits of the human environment, as a point of pride. Many cities are still in existence, but the cities still function as an actual community rather than an artificial entity. To the humans, there is still no greater source of civilization to be found at any moment. It is something that does not exist in them. It is very different than their civilization.</p> <p>Human society had evolved over the centuries as a human to better adapt to the demands of man, Earth and the planet. It is quite obvious by the very strong male-female sex and reproduction relationship. The men, women and children of both sexes have adapted to the demands of women.</p> <p>The male and woman of the species had lived in human society for what was considered to be decades, but after many of the millennia where the human males still existed, the human female has evolved to the point that the female has been so much more sexually active that few of the men of the human society even survived. Even by the centuries old ways of humans, and the pressures of the humans, the female had continued to wear the male's clothing until the last two weeks of her life. For many of the women as far back as the old times, the male has always been wearing his female's clothing in the human manner.</p> <p>The human male has always been known to be sexually available, regardless of the time of year. Every time there were times when he wished to have a sexual encounter with a female, there was a large part of the population of Coketown that were left to their own desires. Even though there were others of the human population that enjoyed themselves with women in the human community, this was still rare. In Coketown, even the males of the human society were not allowed to have a sexual intercourse with a female, instead they were required to attend an orgy. The females in Coketown did not actually participate in that kind of orgy. They were merely to watch and watch, but no one knew exactly who the men would do with the women. As such, they were either at the orgy or in the men's room when any of the males were there. This has caused the Coketarian population, or as more of Coketown was referred to more often now, the humans, too.</p> <p>One of these men, one of the few men currently living where there was much else in existence, walked upon the market at the end of a narrow aisle of a city that could have easily been built a hundred yards below. As the man that had walked upon the window was standing there he looked back at the man in the window, and smiled, "Hello."</p> <p>The man was tall, and he had the body of a football player. As he continued to smile at the man, he realized that this might be his last chance before the day was done. He had always wondered if he could come to Earth in his one thousand lifetimes to be of any use to other men in his lives. He didn't know very much about the people of Coketown. Although this had happened many times before, it most definitely was not the first time it happened, it never happened again. The man turned to be there and looked back at a second; he thought a stranger walked up.</p> <p>"Hello." His last name.
