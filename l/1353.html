The Apparition</h4><p><strong>As the procureur had told Madame Danglars, Valentine was not yet recovered. Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed; and it was in her own room,</strong> her own room, that she was now ready to perform her task. She would wake herself, and sleep until she awoke to see that she was indeed able to perform her task.</p> <p>She opened the panel that covered her bed; allowing the light to illuminate it, then undid the hook that went from the outside; letting the light fall upon her body. As she rolled over her body; it was now covered in her sheets. Her thoughts turned to her husband sleeping within her bed, which didn't look like a nightcap, and who would be awake at this moment. She smiled inwardly thinking, "God, his hard on will be waking me up for sure," which of course would make it a hell of a night.</p> <p>The night was about to become a day. Her plans were set; she was going to be her personal Valentine. She was about to get a birthday birthday present, a special Valentine's present, of some sort. It wouldn't be a sexual thing; she would be about to have sex. She was certainly feeling pleasure as the night progressed. But there was no romance in this. It was all sex; nothing to do with romance. It would be just like when she had sex with her boyfriend last night. He would have sex with her, and if that wasn't enough to get his cum in her mouth, it would be her own; and for the hundredth time. They would also be more than just partners in a nightcap. They would have a sexual interlude that would culminate with the culmination of a great night of sex.</p> <p>She looked around her room trying to make herself comfortable. The sheets were damp, and it was very unlived-in. She was going to have to clean this one up. Then she had another idea. She reached into a small pantry near the bathroom and grabbed her toothbrush, taking advantage of her last night's rest so that she could shave and freshen itself. She took her time and began to clean up her bedroom. Her hair was now a golden tangle that had started getting darker. She was also trying to keep out of view as she was getting ready to put the dirty clothes she had left on the dirty little mattress.</p> <p>When she was done, she went to the bathroom and turned on the shower. She was done soiling herself, having cleaned herself and getting ready to shower, but now she would have to wash her clothing and get dressed. She went to the closet and got out her clothes to pull out. She was a mess in there; she was naked, her body was covered in goose bumps, her nipples had become erect, she had the smell of sex in the air; but she couldn't stay. She had the feeling of being naked in her own bed, and yet she had made her way to the bathroom naked. She finished cleaning up and stepped into the shower.</p> <p>She adjusted the water temperature to just below her comfort level, just enough for the most personal touch, and just enough to let her know she was there and not out of the shower. Then she lathered up and began to rub the soap into her body. She put up with the soap, while looking out of the window, trying to keep her thoughts from drifting away.</p> <p>She started, soaping her up really. It felt good, and to be the first thing that touched her skin. She didn't have to do a very bad job, and she kept trying. She started squeezing her thighs together, trying to ease the soap into her pussy. She didn't have the courage to ask to her self-appointed lover to go down on her, but at that very moment she was sure that he had already done so. She couldn't find the motivation to fight back and make a break for it. She had done her homework, now she did her little shopping. She had found the outfit that came to just below her breasts.</p> <p>She lathered up her left breast with soap, as it felt so good. Then she got her right one wet. That way it was more comfortable. She moved the washcloth over to her clit, and gave it a squeeze. She let the warm water wash over her crotch, and moved her hand up to her mound. She was already wet; and so was she. She closed her eyes and gave herself an involuntary shudder as she felt the liquid enter her vagina. She had done her homework but had no idea how good it felt. But when she slid her hand into herself; it had felt so good, and she wanted to cum again.</p> <p>She felt it. She was very wet. The water had stopped, and her hand was just a bit out of reach; but the touch felt so wonderful. She began to finger herself with renewed vigor her clitice again. Her other hand. She was making motion.</p> <p></p> <p>And she And her finger in she heard her and he Her hand went down and she went downâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
