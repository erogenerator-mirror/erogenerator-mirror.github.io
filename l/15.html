Yet now, here we were. What Mr. Collins liked best about sex, sex and his job - it's just the opposite of the work of society's greatest talent - was that he was a man who could take it. He was a man who had a sex drive, the ultimate pleasure. And the best fucking man who did it was right now.</p> <p>Oh, yeah, he knew all about the sex life he was having. He was still learning how to best satisfy a woman when it was time for him to be called upon for her. And as much as the sex thing was always his own favorite thing to do when it was time for him to be called upon to perform, the best fuck was to be with someone else who liked to fuck. He wasn't going to be a man without a woman in his life. He was determined that a man never forgets the fact that life is about sex.</p> <p>The daydream of him fucking her was just the beginning. He and his lady in his life was going to be together. And with her still having yet to be a woman, he would let her have his cock again for a while. But to be able to make love to this beautiful woman, he had to give her pleasure. So, naturally, it was only right that he did it all over again.</p> <p>Now, he could hardly wait much longer. And, the sight of her, naked again, made him want her more. He was looking at her breasts, now a little higher than before, and his mouth was dry. She was beautiful, and she knew it, too. He was so hot for her, she could have made him fall at the knees right now. But she couldn't. He had to give her pleasure first.</p> <p>"Now," he said to her, "get on your knees."</p> <p>She looked over at him, uncertain what to do. Oh, please, please, he had to be so good for her, he was so patient. She knew that she was pleasing him. She knew that her performance was worth getting fucked anyway. Yes, she had to do it. Slowly, she crawled to him, her breasts swinging, her hips swaying like a dancer. When she was on her knees beside him, she looked up at him, her big sexy eyes showing everything. "Please, Mr. Collins, don't tease me," she said. Then, in a rush of words, she added, "I want to see your cock."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "Show me that pretty little thing." He didn't know if she was joking or not, and his cock was pointing upwards, up straight. He had a cock now, he'd thought it was just that, so he'd told her it was for her. So he put it to her - at that moment, it was for her - and his cock jerked up, up stiff as a rocket.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "Oh, yeah. I feel the thrill of it."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I know how you feel."</p> <p>"Not now."</p> <p>Mr. Collins put his cock back in her. "Don't move," he said. "It's just a moment. Come on, show me how you really feel." He was looking for a moment at her beautiful face, then his eyes fell on the small part at the tip of her breasts and she looked over at him, uncertain. He looked down at her a moment, then looked back up at her. "Take your blouse off -- and don't say a thing," he said. Then, his cock jerked upwards again, a jolt of the same feeling now that he'd had before.</p> <p>The bra came off. Her tits were larger than he remembered, and he remembered how much he enjoyed her breasts. He reached around with one hand and cupped one of the cheeks of her butt. Then he cupped the other. Then he wrapped his fingers around her waist, feeling around until he found the zipper down her back.</p> <p>He stepped out of his pants and she saw the look on his face as he took her in his hands and lifted her from the floor. He looked as though he was going to climb back down.</p> <p>"Wait, let me," he said.</p> <p>She could see his excitement clearly in his eyes as he lifted her up by his hands and pulled her to him and put her on top of the bed. She knew it was the perfect position for him to kiss her. If it hadn't happened, she would have tried to make him do it. But she didn't. She had only to move a little away from him so she could look down at him, see what it from her point of view that was his eyes between her breasts. She was very happy there, at this time.</p> <p></p> <p>. She could enjoy it as he was the best of him, and thisâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
