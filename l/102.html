THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</h4><p><strong>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman</strong>.</p> <p>We had both been of age. We had gotten married in August and my wife had gone back to school with me. The story of our short affair did not begin until this very day.</p> <p>That night after having gone to bed, we were in my bedroom, lying in each other's arms. We were kissing and caressing ourselves, exploring each other's body with our hands, our lips, our necks, our bodies. It was so sensual to touch another man's woman intimately. In a way it was the most erotic thing I had ever done.</p> <p>We never did say a peck of goodnight to our lovers. I didn't. It wasn't romantic though. For the brief time I could remember, I felt a little like a peeping tom. A young man was sitting in a bed, naked, with his very erect penis pointing almost straight up at the sky. He was rubbing his penis between his legs, letting one hand slide down his abdomen until his penis was pressing out on top of the sheet. The sight of his penis caused me to involuntarily touch myself between my legs. I couldn't take my eyes off of my sex organ.</p> <p>"Can you feel it?" I whispered, almost to myself.</p> <p>But we had no response. The boy was masturbating. I could even feel the dampness between my legs.</p> <p>My penis was fully erect right in front of me.</p> <p>"You feel funny?"</p> <p>I couldn't answer that.</p> <p>"I'm going to do it."</p> <p>With that, he was on top of me in the next second. I felt his penis touch my face. It was moist from the moisture on my throat. I opened my mouth and allowed its wet tip to be pulled into my mouth, causing him to moan. His penis slipped down across my lips until it was deep inside my mouth. I couldn't believe he entered me. I had never felt anything as erotic as that! His penis slid so slowly down into my mouth that my breath was almost sucked out of my throat by his cock. His penis went over my tongue and I felt the heat of his body as it went down inside me. It was the first ever sexual act I had performed for another man. It was very erotic!</p> <p>He was coming. I felt it. I tasted it. I had never tasted a man before, especially one I had only met last year. I could feel his sperm shoot into me, like he said a penis would. It wasn't coming directly or any sort of orgasm. When it was over, he was breathing hard, his penis shrinking, sliding off of my face.</p> <p>"What next?"</p> <p>He was panting. "I haven't seen you in months."</p> <p>"I'm not that old."</p> <p>"I'm 18."</p> <p>It was as though the words were coming out of my mouth that finally broke the ice. "You can't be that young."</p> <p>He laughed. "Come here."</p> <p>He took my hand, leaned back on the bed and looked me in the eye. "Where...?"</p> <p>"Suck me. Make me come in your mouth. Make me come. You already know how I taste, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good boy. Now lie back down on the bed with your head on the pillow. Don't touch anything else. If you move, it's bad. Don't even have a climax. Just lie there, while I go to the bathroom."</p> <p>"Wait. Now."</p> <p>Then he was gone.</p> <p>I had had no intention to go. He had not touched me anywhere except between the crack of my ass and between my legs. I had to be more precise than that.</p> <p>I lay in my bed, my penis soft now, and lay there for a while. I looked over at the clock. It was late afternoon. I had a full day tomorrow to think.</p> <p>I hadn't decided where to go from this. It had been a very emotional time for me, a time so personal I had felt I would lose my family and my career and it couldn't possibly include having sex with a stranger.</p> <p>I had been having some thoughts. But now, I was going to have to deal with them. I found myself thinking about the possibility of making love to the man who was just inches from me. I was going to have to make sure that he knew about my activities with other men.</p> <p>I had to admit that though the possibility of this would bring about a change in my thinking was a little overwhelming. I have always been somewhat of a voyeur, even though I had not been as sexually active sexually liberated as my wife. But that summer had helped to make that change. I guess what would happen. Was, of course. I was. The young is older was it was more mature.
