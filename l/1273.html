The Cemetery of the Château d’If</h4><p><strong>On the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude folds was stretched</strong> a pair of condom-covered cock, two-and-a-half, inches from my cock. I was still sitting in my chair, but now we both had our clothes off: I, in my underclothes, the girl who was not already a participant, and she, in her underclothes. Naked and beautiful. She kissed me, on the mouth, like the world would kiss her back, my tongue exploring that mysterious pink surface that had never been penetrated. As we broke the kiss, she raised up on tip-toe, and stepped into position over my erection. I could read the softness of her cheekbones and her full lips, as they surrounded me from the tip of my head to the base of the thick helmet, parting them as I entered her. She was incredibly warm, wet, and wet and horny. I held her asscheeks in my palms and pressed them flat against my hips. My cock glistened with her juices, which clung wetly to the head, so that a drop glistened on the tip, and another was droplet, the same shade as her lips.</p> <p>We smiled at one another, and kissed again, and again. Our mouths and our naked bodies opened each other's pussies to us, so that we both slid down until we were sitting, one on top, with my tip just inside her as we fucked, and one on top of me. She was still wearing her bra, so the straps fell away, but were soon on the bed. Her bare breasts lay between us, with perfectly pink, hard nipples. I slid my hands over the surface of her small, pert, naked boobflesh, and squeezed it gently, like a toddler groping its mother's nipple through a blanket, like I was doing with my first crush.</p> <p>"It feels so good to have a girl who wants you," she said, between each kiss. "I feel so dirty having this inside my body."</p> <p>I pulled her bra strap off over her shoulder and tossed it onto the floor. It joined the restrains, and she raised her arms up over her head as I pushed the end of my erection into her center, and she raised her body toward mine, until her head hung down. She pushed her cuntlips down with my knob and I slid all the way inside within her.</p> <p>"That's right, this is exactly how I was before I found this place," Amy said, smiling with delight at my cock.</p> <p>She rode my cock, her clitoris rising into my body in a delicate little curve. I was surprised at how good she felt to my body--she felt exactly what I did, except the way I did it. My hands fondled her breast, and I pinched her nipples. My cock slid into her, all the way, as her clitoris rose from the end, up and down with the muscles behind her pussy, as it moved within. Her body seemed to move in that timeless rhythm--the tightness, the undulations, the motions, the ecstasy. Her kisses were becoming harder, more aggressive, the more insistent...it wasn't so rough...she was kissing it like she had a tongue...she was licking it, sucking it, tonguing it...I don't even know how...I was fucking her...feeling the pressure in my groin, feeling the rhythm of her tight asscheeks sliding up and down the length of my cock, all the way in and out so smoothly, and feeling it slide in and out of her. I felt the warmth in my cock, the feeling of her inner labia touching my hips.</p> <p>Her soft words seemed like little bells outside this window, as we continued fucking. They rang on our own moans, as we were joined, and I felt her climax with hers, my body shaking violently with my own, and she fell onto me as I felt her pussy contracting around me as I felt the rush to the climax. We came together, and lay in each other's arms. Amy and I held each other as we came for a long time. She kissed my temple, and was the first to sit up.</p> <p>"That was the most wonderful moment of my life," she said, as she lay back, her legs spread open again. I climbed off the bed to stand, and she stood, and took me by the hand to lead me back to my bedroom.</p> <p>We lay in the bed for a long time; we were both exhausted, having enjoyed our first time in a full day. She had no objection to having an orgasm, though. After a while she rolled over on her back, and opened her eyes, and gazed into mine. "for you", and her arms, and the glow, "for me. with my lips. "for me. "for her. a happy little kisses and my hand to my lips. I have me.
