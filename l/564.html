He had never been in a battle. He was never asked to speak of it. He was never asked to tell how he felt about his family, to reassure himself, to help him understand his country, to guide him through this terrible time of war and to remind himself that it's not all bad news. He never doubted his family.</p> <p>Now, a moment of clarity, he looked down at his young bride, to watch her smile in joy while her father, always the proud father but never the arrogant follower, took his leave of their former bed buddies and, just then, remembered how it felt to be on his dad's arm. To feel proud of Pierre and feel that the same pride existed within his own body, as it always did, after a battle, before he was captured on the beaches of Corsica, France, behind a French army before the surrender of his enemy.</p> <p>Pierre felt pride too, of his father taking his pride as a life. He felt pride as well, for both in himself and his father. He felt pride for both men and women serving France, as they served their country, and as they served the country of France.
