In these ways, the man must have a true and profound knowledge of a woman's pleasure, one whose love comes from love. In the long run, the man must have both.</p> <p>And now I was fucking. And I had never fucked anyone before; I had not even kissed, or even kissed someone for that matter. Not in the real world. But, I was being fucked by someone, and as I had done it and had given me my first orgasm, I enjoyed it because this was the man who it was I was fucking. It came to me that I was an ideal match and I had a whole lot more to give. With the one man, I was a true love, or a friend, or a lover or even a lover. I would be able to love one more time, then to have the other, or even to have the other both and enjoy each of them together, until the next time. And I was getting that.</p> <p>The man I was fucking said the word love. In the way the word is so common in men, it is, the word is, the word is so important, and they say it in this way; they just say it in the way a person tells another person. And in the way he is saying it, 'I love you', in the words, 'I love you'. I am sure that is it.</p> <p>The time came. And in the way he said it in the words, I came.</p> <p>It was a good, hard fuck. We were both panting; I'm sure you can guess that I could feel myself, not knowing when I did cum. I have never cum as hard as I just came. It took a little effort before I remembered my spot, it made me lose some of the momentum but it was still good. It went on and on. Then he was on his back, legs wide apart, legs together and still fucking. It had not been my intention in doing so but he could have known then what I wanted to do if he had known what I wanted to do. And in his mind, he knew exactly what I was thinking.</p> <p>I don't know if he had even heard me, but the next moment the words, 'I love you', were like a bolt of lightning; he went on fucking me, again and again. Then it was my turn. I was in heaven. I was cumming too; I had come to this point where I could cum again and again.</p> <p>He wanted me to.</p> <p>"You better not," I said. "I don't want to hurt you."</p> <p>"You won't hurt me. I love you, I love you. I'll never be hurt."</p> <p>He laughed.</p> <p>"I'm not going to hurt you, if you will tell me," he said, then turned me to him and began kissing me and caressing me.</p> <p>When I felt him hardening inside me again, I told him, "We should fuck, make love now," and with that, we separated, fell together on to the bed.</p> <p>We didn't fuck or make love. We made love, and it lasted for long enough. There were times that I didn't cum just that much once, when he came so hard after having just fucked me, I didn't cum, so he did it a first time too. The second time, it was a bit more subdued and gentle. We didn't do much with foreplay. I wasn't exactly sure if he planned the fucking but what did I want to do? There was an end to the fucking, so to speak. We lay together with our bodies lying under us.</p> <p>Eventually we got up. He wanted to shower. I decided to shower with him. With his nakedness, I got a little more adventurous with my shower. I kissed his shoulders, chest, belly, and his pubes before, kneeling, I lifted his flaccid penis and placed it on the edge of the shower seat. It was about the same size as my own. I got behind him and started to wash his body all over, moving with him to wash his buttocks, around his legs and around his balls. He liked me to do it there, to make me touch his penis.</p> <p>The thing about doing it under the shower, that it was best to wash the person in the water, was that the water would stay so steady that our skin would be wet, and there would still be the washable feeling. It was always a lovely feeling. To soap my own body was a bit of an adventure, but at the same time, I loved doing it so. Once I was getting my first time under the pleasure.</p> <p>to shower, there. I was so very gentle. I just had to be the showering of him—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
