Ulysses slept in</strong> his own bed until he was awakened by the bright sunlight streaming in the large windows in her suite. Danae's mind and body were awash in pure pleasure and the warmth of the sun on her face made the dream seem a dream come true.</p> <p>Danae's first encounter with Ulyser was an unusual one for Danae, but she did not have to do much with it. She had the taste of his sperm in her mouth before when she tried to get him to ejaculate with her body—not that he was quite so reluctant. It was just the way that some of Ulyser's semen tasted different than a man's. Some of his sperm tasted slightly musky and some of it tasted like semen, and some of his semen just felt like semen. Danae learned that she liked what she tasted and she learned that she liked what she tasted as much as she liked what she tasted but she would not swallow it when Ulyser asked for it.</p> <p>She wondered if Danae would ever be able to suck Ulyser, since it would be pretty difficult. The question of Danae sucking Ulyser was a little scary for Danae, but she was sure it would be ok. The only other decision Danae had made was whether or not she would swallow Ulyser when it appeared that it was the right thing. It was also pretty hard just trying to swallow it after Ulyser's semen was oozing out of her mouth so that Danae could drink it. Danae decided that she would try it with Ulyser once—probably sooner than later given the circumstances and the lack of blood to produce even a little of Ulyser's semen. Besides, being able to have Ulyser in her mouth without having to swallow it may also give Danae an opportunity to do something else.</p> <p>Danae's first time with Ulyser was the first of many times. Ulyser liked it but Danae wasn't sure Danae really wanted to try it until after Ulyser came in Danae's mouth rather than the first time. Danae took the first swallow of Ulyser without much objection—she didn't even know what it was Danae really wanted to do, but Ulyser was very good and she found that, having Ulyser in her mouth was much better than not doing something. Danae's first taste of Ulyser's semen, which lasted almost from the first swallow, was the first taste of Ulyser's semen, not the first taste of Ulyser to come.</p> <p>Danae took the first lick of Ulyser's semen in her mouth, although this was the first time in her life that she had tasted semen—it tasted more like semen than semen. It also tasted much like that semen was supposed to taste. Danae's own first taste of Ulyser's semen was with her boyfriend, whose semen was actually very different from what Ulyser's semen tasted like. Ulyser's semen had some bitterness in it, and it was kind of salty—and it tasted kind of exciting. Danae took the first lick of Ulyser's semen again, this time without much resistance—it wasn't a struggle to swallow it. Danae wondered if it was possible for Danae to suck on Ulyser's erection.</p> <p>Danae didn't suck on Ulyser's erection. It was just different. Danae used her lips, tongue and mouth on Ulyser's penis. As Ulyser's penis became more and more erect, Danae began to understand how it would feel to swallow Ulyser's erection as it seemed to fill her mouth with more and more of Ulyser's semen. Danae wondered if Ulyser had done this before, especially knowing that it would be very difficult, although Danae doubted it was ever so difficult for Ulyser to receive his semen in the way that Ulyser did. Danae thought, though, that her boyfriend didn't make it impossible for her to suck his erection. She had already been tempted, but Ulyser was way faster than she was.</p> <p>Ulyser wasn't lying when he said that Ulyser's erection was different than it was all the time. Sometimes it was even better. He said that Ulyser's erection was much harder than the erection of most men. He also said that a woman's penis had more shape rather than any other one's that could be considered a 'penity. Most men are extremely sexual; most are attracted to women's penies. Some men were a bit more likely attracted to penity. Some, however, were attracted to Uly are more attracted to penity; and to ules, a bit' attracted; of them attract than men. His erect and attracted to attracted. It was the same. Uly and with the same. He and the same. It was just different and it was indeed.
