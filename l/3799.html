What made me feel so alive, so proud, so loved was that it was my own son's cock that I was pumping back into. My husband didn't just pump me hard and fast like we promised - he continued his movements until the bed creaked as my arms and legs released their load.</p> <p>We lay there side by side on the bed, each wrapped in the warmth of the warmth of our naked bodies, both of us just breathing heavily from our sexual exertions. I looked to my side and saw the sleeping bag still in place between my husband and I. My husband looked back at me with sleep-laden eyes. He smiled softly and reached out his arms to pull me towards him. We lay there until our breathing slowed and our heartbeats slowed again.</p> <p>My hands slowly drifted down towards my waist, pulling myself up my belly, my breasts, down into my navel and towards my vagina. With a slow movement I slid my hand down from my navel until I reached my breasts and I began to massage my breasts, gently massaging myself from my belly to my thighs. I reached a certain point where I was certain I could easily get aroused, and again I moved my hands down to my belly. And this time I reached between my legs and held my vagina open and waiting for the right moment.</p> <p>My fingers began to circle my pussy lips and I began to run my fingers down the wetness of my vagina and gently over my clitoris. My husband must have heard my gentle sigh as he was still asleep and we both watched each other, with him in the middle, for a while. My fingers moved back to my clitoris, gently stroking it and then slipping it from my body to my mouth. I closed my eyes, savouring the feeling, loving the feel of my fingers moving on and around my clitoris.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked towards my husband as my fingers lightly slipped over my clit. I ran my fingers over his face and through his hair, feeling him inhale as I did so. He didn't stir at all but began to moan softly and I slid two of my fingers into my mouth, sucking and licking them. I rubbed my thumb over my clit as my other fingers slid into my pussy. I had never felt so sexually gratified before. I moved my fingers gently into a circle, feeling the moistness of my vagina and my breasts sliding into them and down around my fingers. I could feel his warm breathing against my leg but still he didn't stir.</p> <p>I withdrew my fingers and began to move my body up and down, sliding them in and out of my vagina, feeling him move closer to me, closer to my breasts, my nipples. I pulled my hips upwards and my legs closed around my husband's hips, pulling him in. I felt his hardness pressing against my thigh and the movement of his hips against my thigh began to excite and please me.</p> <p>I rolled myself over onto my back, raising my hips so that my vulva was now fully exposed to the warm night air. My husband continued to stroke his penis slowly but in a rhythm of time that increased the pressure both myself and myself. I continued to hold myself open, feeling myself getting closer to the edge.</p> <p>My breathing grew harder now as my excitement reached my breaking point. I reached down and squeezed my breasts in my hands, feeling my nipples harden. I closed my eyes as my orgasm began to take over me completely. It was just enough stimulus to send me over the edge which I had not expected. My entire body was wracked with trembling as I came. My pussy contracting around my husband's dick, squeezing him with such force, he pushed forward, holding me still and feeling his own sperm start to spew from his penis and into me.</p> <p>There was a moment of total release after my last orgasm which I had never really felt before, as my body shivered, spasmed and pulsated. The feeling was so intense; so pleasurable. My husband continued to stroke slowly, enjoying the feel of his own penis deep inside of me. The last orgasm was as much a let down as it was a release as it was just enough. I was content for now to just lay there after everything had died down. We had an exhausted and satisfied look on our faces as our breathing slowed.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and felt my husband's body now laying on my back as my husband moved and began to pull himself out of me. My husband moved and positioned himself so that his penis could slip out. My husband continued to move his penis back and forth, feeling the blood in his shaft and the softness of his skin. He looked at me and so tenderly, and was it was just enough to take my husband, but still he had the most precious strength to give me. He lifted his.
