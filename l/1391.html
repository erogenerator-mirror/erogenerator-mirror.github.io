She locked it after admitting me, as she had done before,</strong> and went up with her escort and followed close behind. For some reason I wasn't surprised, since we had our own home to us with servants working, yet we'd gone to our own room to fuck; in one of our first encounters in our new house that was the homecoming.</p> <p>I was glad we were the last ones in the family. If we were lucky it would be the first time for us in three months.</p> <p>I walked through her house, enjoying the heat from her windows. She was the last student of mine. She had been the first in the family, the most of all so far. But somehow I hadn't reckoned on the house to be a family house, that she would be of all people at school. It had a life of its own, and yet as soon as she was aware of it someone would be pushing it, pushing it.</p> <p>She was going to be my first girl and I couldn't help but smile as I went past the last door and into the garden. She was standing naked waiting until I entered our garden as her eyes were on me now, not as a boyfriend but as an intimate family friend.</p> <p>I moved behind her and kissed her on the top of the head, not enough to make sense or anything besides an intimate kiss, but enough to make sense, to tell her that I was hers.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you," I whispered in her ear, the first words since our separation that night.</p> <p>It had to feel too good for her to even reply. I was going to fuck her so hard that she would have to beg me to stop for the rest of the day, but after last night's fucking I wasn't about to stop there.</p> <p>"Wait," she muttered, "We're not supposed to do anything like this, let us go. We can talk in the other room."</p> <p>"I want you to be honest."</p> <p>"Sure, I want to be honest. And I want you to know why we went to the other room last night. It was for you. For you. To keep you from thinking that way."</p> <p>"Do I need to remind you that I've fucked your wife? She's so fucking good at fucking, you would know. Is that it, or just fucking, huh?"</p> <p>I wasn't that particular person. I wasn't very religious, and I didn't wear any kind of religious habit, that's for damn sure. But even the sight of her cunt was enough to convince me. She was in so much more of a state of arousal I was certain she would be in the same state at that moment.</p> <p>"No, that's not it. It's a surprise, it's something I've never been able to do. I've never even fucked a woman before, I was too scared. I'm sorry..."</p> <p>"But I've got to know something. You're not a virgin or a virgin, just really, really good with women. Why don't you just tell me? It's okay to do this and that, it's going to be okay for you. I didn't put you on the hook because you're a virgin, but I've been a busy partner, a lot with the girls, and with girls. You've got a lot to learn, and I'm sure I can teach you a thing or two."</p> <p>"I'm scared. Just like a girl that doesn't know all the moves to get down, I'm scared too," I answered quietly.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure."</p> <p>"Let's do this. I just hope that we can last a bit longer as it turns out, if we can. If I'm too big, it's not going to be the end of this."</p> <p>"Oh I don't know," she replied, "but I don't want to hurt you any more either."</p> <p>"Don't worry."</p> <p>"I mean, I understand it might be a bit scary, being your first guy, but there's a part of me that wonders if we'll end up doing that."</p> <p>The more of a chance that I had that if we went our separate ways and found a girl who wanted me, the more my plan might develop. But I had to make time to find that girl first, so I wasn't sure if she was willing to let me fuck her, or if I had to do it from behind. It was an impossible situation.</p> <p>"What time do you want to come home? You want me dressed up?"</p> <p>"Oh, I think we got a deal. Here are our keys. You get the spare keys from your car, and I come for a long walk for one hour."</p> <p>"And now I'll call my own the spare and walk, and my mother. You're coming for that to me. I'm not yours and be my husband—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
