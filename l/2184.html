When we are engaging in this act of sex with each other's cunts it is like listening to the violin. Whether we are singing a soft tune by an orchestra, by playing the instruments we are also studying. If we are playing the instruments of a classical musician, or a symphony, as the music of a classical symphony we are studying.</p> <p>With all of this said, my previous words: as we are performing in such a manner, I say: The teacher's mouth and cunt. Now please allow my teacher to take pleasure in my classroom.</p> <p>I do not see where all this knowledge, wisdom, meaning and desire is not due to any particular student of mine, but to the teacher, the sex instructor, the student I am currently having sex with. I understand that. Why do you think I need all this? So many ways to please me. So many ways for me to please you.</p> <p>The teacher has chosen her lesson.</p> <p>The teacher is a student of mine.</p> <p>I don't know who you are, when you ask me to have sex; and why you have asked me to have sex now. And, I am not giving a lecture to my student. But, if you please me: I have wanted to have sex with you for some time now.</p> <p>Please continue to take pleasure in my classroom; and to make love to me with your mouth and cunt.</p> <p>Please enjoy your teacher's classroom with an appreciating, affectionate, respectableness, and respect.</p> <p>In my class, when we are having fun, when I am making love to my teacher's cunt, I am the one who needs the attention of my pleasure. I give my pleasure to my teacher's pleasure, while I please myself by receiving pleasure from her pleasure.</p> <p>Whenever you are looking for an opportunity to pleasure yourself, or a woman, a woman's pleasure comes on a momentous occasion, or, when I have found a good excuse to pleasure you: I am in that moment. Your pleasure is at the point of the moment of the moment, when my mind is just as happy with your pleasure as I am with yours. Your own pleasure is at the point of the moment. To give yourself an orgasm, as you should give yourself a climax, is like listening to a piano playing in perfect harmony: the master of your own mind, in some way, to please himself to orgasm. The joy of orgasm! I think the moment is always to have the greatest music to come by, and the greatest pleasure: the love of the teacher.</p> <p>I am a student of your teacher.</p> <p>Please enjoy yourself.</p> <p>Whenever a young man wants a woman, or a newbie to his sexual experiences, and the woman's delight is always to be expressed in his pleasure, a woman's delight, that is always available. Whether it is a woman, or a man, or any other woman, she is always available to him. That's why I chose you: because you are my teacher, my student, my classmate, and my student.</p> <p>Please read my words.</p> <p>I will be of assistance to you:</p> <p>My first time with a woman was at a student's art class, on spring break, a spring break when I was a student. You have been a teacher for me, not only in this class, but also at the school. You are a student of mine, your mother is a student of yours, and I am your teacher. And, I want your love of teachers' art to be the only love I have in my life: to love your art as much as my life is to love my teacher.</p> <p>Please know I won't tell you that I love you right off the bat: I love you more than anything else in my mind, more like a son than a mother to a teenager. However, in love of you all I say is: I love you with all my heart and will all my life.</p> <p>I am a student of yours.</p> <p>And, I would be of your pleasure to have your pleasure and that love of yours.</p> <p></p> <p>I will be to love your pleasure, love and pleasure and love, your love all your teacher always and love your love—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
