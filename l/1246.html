After that last flash of light, complete extinction ensued. No more familiarity, no more good-morning with a kiss, never more that word so profoundly sweet:</strong> "Fuck you," or a whispered 'please don't do that,' with some promise of a lifetime of blissful joy and contentment?</p> <p>I'm pretty sure I got it right. Yes. Definitely! Yes, I'll do more than promise. Sure, I'm a little nervous about it all too. I need another break and I think I've managed the break as well as with a little time and money.</p> <p>That kiss. Definitely. Just to start, though.</p> <p>I'm going to do this. I'm going to fuck you. And the way you've been doing it, for too long, and because you were too eager to tell me to stop, well, maybe you haven't been enough to want it.</p> <p>It's not like that. I don't expect that. Not really. That kiss was all a lie. I have always been curious if the whole thing came true. I can't deny that, after the first flash of light, even now, I'm still curious about something. And I'm definitely curious about the other things.</p> <p>I could make you forget everything else, because I don't know if I could forget all of this. If what you've told me is true, I could forget the whole thing. Nothing else was more important.</p> <p>But before you go to bed, I must tell you all the good things in life. I know, actually, that you had to come to this very moment. You were just so...</p> <p>I'm just not sure I deserve this, this much. Please don't tell your parents. Please don't tell your brother or sister. But please don't tell anyone about my fucking you. I don't really care, it's just not right, anyway.</p> <p>So how does this work?</p> <p>I'm not going to say it for fear of being rude, though. It isn't your fault, I'm telling you. I've been doing it only because I'm curious so you wouldn't expect me to. Because I'm curious and curious and just...I'm just not sure why.</p> <p>I know what I'm doing now. I'm fucking you, right there in your doorway. I'm really feeling that sexy pussy, the way you can't help but move in rhythm with my thrusts, the way the lights go up, and I'm thinking about that gorgeous mouth of yours, moving in and out of my wet, wanting mouth, the way the wind outside leaves your face, how your nipples are standing out so inviting, how your clit is hard, like every fucking inch of my cock is making contact with it... It is like...I'm not sure you have a wetter pussy than this. I'm not sure where all this will take us.</p> <p>Please promise me something. Please give us some time to think about this, because I know how much it's hurting me right now. Please promise me that, please.</p> <p>Please. I love you. I'll never give up.</p> <p>Oh, God. Oh, God, please. Please. You're gonna make this last.</p> <p>Oh, yes. I promise. I'll make it last. Oh, God. Yes. I'm gonna hold you in my arms and hold you tight.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I heard the door click. My parents weren't home.</p> <p>You can fuck me now! I don't want to even think about it. I don't want this now; I don't want this.</p> <p>It's just not enough. Not now. Just the first time, so long as it takes. Just let me make love with you.</p> <p>Maybe the first time. When I'm just a kid, I've thought back and remember everything. Maybe I forgot something. Maybe I'm making love in the morning, like if it's my day off. Perhaps everything will return to that happy little day, when I wake again and see you all alone, and you've got me on my back in the morning, too. Maybe that'll change my life. It will. And perhaps I can still love you. Maybe I can still think about you, my little sister, my lover, that woman I've never seen before when it's still all I can ever do to keep you.</p> <p>We will get past this. We are still together but it will always be a bit awkward at first. It will always be awkward about how I feel about you, your boyfriend, my lover. But I can't promise you anything. I can't promise that I can't have you. It would just really hurt me. That's probably what you told me. I'd really hate to lose you and see you all alone again. Then let it back down that day. Let this fear that first time. Let it never take a bit, that fear...the truthfully and love you.</p> <p>"We can't you've never forget these, but—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
