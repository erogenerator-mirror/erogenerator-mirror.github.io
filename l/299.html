In the gloom the courtyard</strong> overlooked the light of the city's great window in silence.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and drifted to rest in the warmth of the sun. Time fell away and in no danger of being disturbed by my sleeping companion.</p> <p>"A bit of a mess isn't it," she whispered, as if I wasn't there.</p> <p>"I am not a mess," I replied without hesitation.</p> <p>"How can a mess be better?"</p> <p>"I am a clean slate, not a mess. It's like a beautiful, warm, soft breeze drifting by that feels wonderful," I smiled and she grinned back, the first smile in a long time I could remember.</p> <p>"I'm glad to hear that," she said with a shy laugh.</p> <p>"I'm glad to hear that too," I assured her.</p> <p>She leaned in and softly kissed me on the cheek, her lips were so soft.</p> <p>"Let's rest for a little bit," I suggested.</p> <p>I snuggled up with her and rested my head against her chest. She wrapped her arms around me and we slept, enjoying the morning as a beautiful morning dawned outside while my eyes slept in darkness.</p> <p>Chapter Two–Baking my head on a bedsheet</p> <p>Time passed quickly.</p> <p>"Mmmhmmm," I whispered, as soon as I felt the spoon against my back and she stirred.</p> <p>"Mmmm," I repeated and she sighed in approval.</p> <p>After a while she asked, "May I?"</p> <p>"Yes," I answered quickly and in a whisper so as not to attract any attention.</p> <p>I felt her hand caress my breasts through the soft fabric of my robe.</p> <p>"A kiss in front?" I whispered to encourage her.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"We're so open," she whispered seductively.</p> <p>I leaned back against her and her hand slid down from my breasts and I groaned softly. My body began to react as her hand traced my body, my legs parted and I felt the silk of my panties. The warmth of her hand was driving me wild and I became more aroused. Her hand lingered in my panties and she stroked my inner thighs gently and I moved towards her.</p> <p>"Come on little darling, let's get inside and have some fun," she said seductively and I turned to face her in the darkness.</p> <p>Without a word, she pulled my panties down revealing my pussy and I pulled my legs upwards. She knelt between my legs and slid her body backwards and forwards until my head was only inches from her pussy. I reached over with my hand and pulled back the hood of my clitoris and she stroked my clitoris gently but firmly.</p> <p>"Oh sweetheart," she whispered, "this is heaven."</p> <p>She licked and kissed my clitoris then kissed her way downwards, she ran her tongue under my lips and I sighed with joy.</p> <p>"Oh no," I whispered in my sleep.</p> <p>Again her lips and tongue slid onto my inner love box and I felt the wetness of her tongue against me while I felt my own tongue slide against my clitoris.</p> <p>We continued to pleasure each other in quiet bliss for what felt like a long time. In the darkness she used her one hand to slide down the front of my robe, her other hand fondled and rubbed my breasts.</p> <p>"Oh lovely," she whispered with pleasure as she explored my body with her fingers.</p> <p>I was so aroused, her teasing had me gasping in passion and I loved the feeling of her fingers sliding over my G-spot. I continued teasing myself while enjoying the sensation of her tongue on my body and her mouth upon my clitoris. My eyes glowed with the pleasure I was giving myself to her but more pleasure also came from the pleasure of her teasing.</p> <p>"Oh darling, don't stop," I whispered urgently.</p> <p>She was enjoying my body as she continued the teasing and my moans turned into whimpers.</p> <p>"Oh baby, just please go easy," I begged in my mind.</p> <p>I watched her breasts as she pleasured herself, mesmerised at her hand stroking me until I couldn't wait any longer. I opened my eyes in the darkness and looked at her kneeling by my feet.</p> <p>"Baby, you've been awake for a while," I whispered.</p> <p>"No, I need to be touched. And you're going to love it," she answered and her gentle touch soon had me moaning in pleasure.</p> <p>"It's okay, I'm quite ready now," I said with a little too and felt my body tensed up by her touch and slowly.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"It's beautiful isn't too, not too, no one of us, you're too, me too, you're just don't know—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
