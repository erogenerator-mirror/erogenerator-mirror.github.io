G. Wells </h3><h4>THE EXODUS FROM LONDON.</h4><p><strong>So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning—the stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent,</strong> the tide overcoming it again in a tide of dizzying excitement.</p> <p>Then you feel it, the sweet, warm, moist, velvet-softness of my cock pressed into your vagina, filling it with desire. You're wet and slick and sopping; no resistance, no resistance from the invasion or the withdrawal. I fuck your brains out, your brain alive with pleasure and passion, your body giving itself totally to the thrust of my cock. Yes, I'm fucking you!</p> <p>I keep going, going deeper, deeper, deeper still, making you beg for more, beg for the fucking to end. You hear me, "I'm gonna give you everything I've got!" you thought, but I want more, you need more, you need my cum! I can feel you, I can feel the heat of it--I can hear it as I fuck your body. I want your orgasm, your release, your life given in your mind. All of that just has to be me, fucking you, fucking you in the world.</p> <p>Just as a child on Christmas morning, when all the lights were off just to tell what the world saw in his bed while I was giving you a birthday fuck, you've become the object of my passion. You're mine now, and I'll let you have any pleasure you want, whenever or wherever I want it.</p> <p>A tear escapes your eyelids, a tear that can only be broken off once and again when I'm ready. And then you feel it. Your climax, its climax, its release, its orgasm. You're moaning, gasping, you're crying out in ecstasy, a continuous chorus of pleasure rising in your head. It seems endless to you, like I've been building every nerve, every cell of my flesh until the point of no return. Your breathing is coming in little gulps. You can't talk, no words, and you can't move. Your breasts are quivering and you're shaking all over. All your body feels like it's seized up with electricity. And though my fingers are making squishing noises against your skin, you can't feel the sensation of your juices flowing over the sides of my cock, drenching my legs and feet, covering the sheet in your perspiration and juices. You don't need much of a thrill to let out that final scream, when I stop. I'm hard again, almost as hard as the last time, and you still need me to fuck you, to give you a hard, quick fuck that won't let you think about your body for a mere second. You want me to cum—that's it. You want me to cum in your vagina. You want me to fill your body with cum. You want it all, you've made me want to cum so much you can hardly stand it.</p> <p>I don't think you're ready to climax yet, yet. You've been waiting to fuck me for so long, and now I'm going to fuck you! You're gonna get it, soon, but it will not include my cum inside you. You've told me before, you've told me not to cum inside you after all that and not to stop until I had to and you knew it must never happen, that it was just that, and it wouldn't be that big of a deal. I might as well just cum inside you, right here, right now, right inside that wonderful pussy of yours! You've asked me to do that, but all along I had given your pussy what I hoped would be a wonderful orgasm! You are insatiable!</p> <p>If I'm going to fuck you, I need, you'll need to know some of the details. I don't think your favorite bitches, the ones that let me pound their cunts on you to cum in you, the ones that let me lick their assholes as a reward for their being too dirty for you to give me a nice, hard fuck and then they never want to see me leave. You'd never let me leave, ever. So I'm going to tell you about the most personal information your pussy gets to know, the most things you never told me before, that's the secret about how your pussy responds to fucking!</p> <p>So you wait, listening, listening, listening, listening, waiting. But you realize when this is about to get real and you know it will end soon, when my cum will erupt right inside your pussy, the first gush that I've pumped out inside your body for more than three weeks in case you were still a virgin when I did this. I'll fuck you until you're a little wobbly, and you'll always want more. But there's no hurry, not really, and I've got all the time in the chance to get what I need from you. Now.</p> <p>When I got what, what I wanted. I need it I need what I want it to fill—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
