OF THE PUBLIQUE MINISTERS OF SOVERAIGN POWER</h4><p><strong>In the last Chapter I have spoken of the Similar parts of a Common-wealth; In this I shall speak of the parts Organicall, which are Publique Ministers.</strong></p> <p>Note: If you can find this part, you may want to read it first. If you have not read the first four parts of this entry, you will have to leave soon so that the chapter and the rest are complete.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I've had several fantasies about sharing an intimate moment with my husband. The first one is a night out where he watched a movie with the woman. I was wearing a very tight, red cocktail dress which highlighted my body in an extremely suggestive way, showing off my body very clearly. There is nothing that I do not enjoy. I love to dress up in revealing clothes. That dress displayed so seductively my big breasts were visible and so tantalizing I can make myself cum without a single effort. It clung to my form as if it were painted in bright red and left nothing to the imagination, as you can see by my figure. With my legs wide apart, I had the perfect combination to look at a very attractive man. The men are the only ones who are really interested in me. I've felt such desire and longing to have them look at my body. The other part is a way of letting them see everything that I do. Even though I always wear panties, today I have decided to wear a short plaid skirt that looks like a long t-shirt. I was wearing a matching shirt to show all the contours of the rest of my body. The look was very suggestive. The shirt looked like a sports bra, or maybe just a shirt. I was so excited that I can't remember when that shirt was on.</p> <p>As my husband's favorite part of my week is watching a movie (although I've made other plans), I decided to go to a store to buy a very sexy nightshirt and a pair of low cut jeans I'm wearing today. I took a chance and bought a very soft but sensual looking nightgown with spaghetti straps.</p> <p>My husband was very impressed as I went into the store to find him. I smiled a big smile and pointed to a very attractive man whom I thought he wanted to see more. The store was busy so I had to just stand there, feeling very nervous. As he held the door for me I felt very much at ease. He was just his boss and I liked him very much. He made me feel very alive. He knew I knew everything there was to know about him as I walked through the store.</p> <p>"Hello," his voice whispered in my ear.</p> <p>My whole being jumped on fire and my pussy got wet instantly. That moment of intense sexual anticipation had been building all day. I knew that I had to follow these rules.</p> <p>"We should go into the dressing room to join the dressing room," he said and pointed at a side door.</p> <p>I was eager to follow him. I liked his company and it wouldn't matter if I was alone with him.</p> <p>"We should go to the dressing room," I said with a nervous sound.</p> <p>"Please," he said and opened the door to an extremely high end dressing room.</p> <p>"Here," I said giving him my hand and leading him through the doorway.</p> <p>Once inside I quickly closed and locked the door behind us.</p> <p>"Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Ready?"</p> <p>He quickly stripped and turned to face me. I gave him a kiss very passionately. He put his arms around my waist with a strength that I had only seen in movie clips. Our bodies were touching all over. I could feel the throb between our thighs. I was feeling so wanton. I was so much excited for him. I was not able to control myself and was in a state of sexual tension. He was not wearing panties and looked very ready. I pressed my body down into him and felt his stiffening member. We kissed hard with our bodies grinding tightly together. Our tongues thrashed in front of us. Our mouths moved from side to side with his tongue in mine. His fingers dug into my back as I pulled him into me and pressed him against my breasts. His hands were moving all over my body. I felt hot and alive. I loved his strong body. I could not wait for this time to feel him inside me.</p> <p>I felt his hands rub against my skin as they moved over my body. We went on kissing. I felt his fingers touching my nipples. They were very erect and the feeling was so intense. His hands went from my back down to my ass. They were moving all over that delicious ass. I felt his tongue lapping at my pussy. His tongue would go around it and make it extremely wet. His hands made themselves all over my body and touched all my back and my legs. His cock throbbed around my bottom. It was the parts were touching every inch of my body.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I could feel as if to be my body would pressâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
