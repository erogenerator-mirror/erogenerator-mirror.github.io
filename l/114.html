The Period</h4><p><strong>It was the best of times,it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it</strong> was the last of all times, and it was the greatest fuck ever.</p> <p>"I'm cumming, fuck, fuck," I yelled out, "I'm cumming," then groaned loudly as my whole body shook and jerked as my ejaculate pumped into my wife, as my body was filled with cum, as she came with me.</p> <p>"You know you're right, babe," she said with a smile, "Your cum feels so much better inside my pussy, like a different kind of cum inside a different kind of candy," she said as our lovemaking reached a fever pitch of excitement, of passion and desire, we held our passionate love.</p> <p>Finally, my body stopped shaking and trembling and I dropped my weight on her. Her arms were around my back, our lips locked together, and as our passion went out to infinity, we fell asleep as we kissed.</p> <p>* **</p> <p>Next morning, we woke and went to the living room. We didn't stay over that night, and neither did I. We returned to our room, we kissed and fell on the bed while holding each other. I caressed her breasts and rolled her nipples between my fingers. She kissed me passionately as I continued to kiss her.</p> <p>I stopped her with, "Babe, do you still want me to go slow?"</p> <p>She laughed and said, "Are you crazy? You already came for me twice, you came twice tonight, and I still want you this morning,"</p> <p>I smiled and said, "You know I do, but I don't have to use the excuse of 'I think it would be the same thing', if we don't start this right now."</p> <p>She smiled and took my face in her hands, and with her kisses deepened, "I don't know what you know. You never said you wanted me to finish, do you?"</p> <p>"Hell no. Just know you're not alone and that I'm not going to stop loving you, but I want you to have a great big orgasm. No, you won't stop, but you can get a few more in, you can use all the tricks I've learned, you can pull out and lick your cum off my nipples or stroke my clit. Maybe even make me cum with you."</p> <p>She squeezed her breasts, "O.K., but my nipples still tingle a little from so much of what we just did together. I love the way you think of my nipples."</p> <p>I loved that sexy sound of her voice, which made my whole body tingle.</p> <p>Without looking at me, she said, "So, why not turn on the lamp?"</p> <p>I looked at her as she lifted up the nightgown and revealed her pussy that was now soaked with our juices and our saliva.</p> <p>"You have to get up and use the bathroom."</p> <p>"But I don't have the spare room," she said pointing at the couch I was lying on. "You want to watch my beautiful body?"</p> <p>I nodded and said, "Absolutely."</p> <p>She got on her knees next to me on the bed, and then slid over with her knees spread wide, showing me the wet, slippery lips of her pussy.</p> <p>"Do you like how I do it?"</p> <p>I reached over to the side table and brought up the tube of KY jelly that I used for the first time and then rolled the condom over my hard shaft. I reached over to her pussy and took each of her breasts as a hand, and then started to stroke them with both of my hands.</p> <p>"I'm so wet, and so hot," she said, "I love how you make me feel."</p> <p>When I leaned over her to kiss her, she said, "C'mon, kiss me. You've been very good, and I'm going to get very wet." It was really too much. I could feel my climax approaching already, and my climax building to something very different, a lot different, and very intense. She took my head in between her hands as she put my mouth on her, and we french kissed as her hands roamed my body, she held my head against her and made me feel as if I were in love with her, but of my own volition. She said, "Go easy, sweetie, I'll go slow."</p> <p>She took her hand and started to caress my thighs with her hand. I looked down to where we were kissing, and saw that we were both wet with our own juices, and that there were some drops already on her breasts and on her nipples, making them look very erect. "You have such sexy tits, sexy nipples," I continued until she lowered her head and began to kiss her breasts. I was kissing all over them as one of her lips was then the others, so many.</p> <p></p> <p>then theyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
