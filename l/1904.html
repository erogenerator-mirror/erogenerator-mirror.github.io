Reason, and rational power, are faculties which content themselves</h4><p><strong>with themselves, and their own proper operations. And as for their first inclination and motion, that they take from themselves. But their progress is right to the end and object,</strong> as it seems. You see, that's why the old saying, 'Nothing lasts forever', is a better description of their new endeavor, than that of the other.</p> <p>Anyway, my name is Steve Carrington. I've written a few stories here on Literotica, but I've never actually written anything that captured their true emotion. I think what they have going on at the moment is probably my first novel. It's a dark mystery, if you catch that word? Yes, it is. And it's kind of scary, to be honest. If you read these two essays, as well as any other notes that I have left, you're wondering what it is like being with another man's penis.</p> <p>I've never really been attracted to another man's penis... (I've not really been with anyone at all) but I've never thought about another woman's breast as my focus or object. (I've never thought about a man's penis as my focus, even if the other man's was mine. I don't think it's really the way it's supposed to be or the way it's done. That's just a guess.) Well, if you can imagine it, I can imagine it at times. I've always taken to sneaking glances at breasts whenever I could, although I never had the courage to approach someone naked. It's just not something that I actually really want to do. (I've never really, really thought about it before, especially at first.)</p> <p>Anyway, before I continue with the essays on how to enjoy intercourse, I'd like to say that I want to be alone with this man's penis, just one more stroke of his, before we proceed. But even though I've been writing this story and it's got really heavy stuff in places and time, I've been reading it a LOT lately, and I have never really felt comfortable going into details about my sexual activities. And even though my sexual experiences have always been quite varied, this was probably the first one to actually come upon me, but I'm glad that it did.</p> <p>So, that's why the first of today's writing is going by the way: it's a dark mystery and there's definitely something in the way I'm going through the dark for my book. Please take a moment to vote, and please send feedback for me. I appreciate you all so much, especially your votesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
