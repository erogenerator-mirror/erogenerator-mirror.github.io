He was only one of those relatives that he had that had to make me feel happy to be a woman.</p> <p>I'm a woman. A good-looking, intelligent, pretty, smart and intelligent woman. A proud and faithful woman that knows that sex is all but inevitable when it comes from a man and if he satisfies his woman as he will. A woman who has known me since we were children, for as I say, this is what she needed. A woman that had just been given to me for my sexual gratification, who needed a man that would understand her as a woman of great worth and good character.</p> <p>The man I was destined to make my woman.</p> <p>Our parents were a wonderful family. My mother was a lovely, intelligent woman that cared and listened to me, and when I first met her, I fell for her love.</p> <p>The day I proposed to her, the day I proposed myself, the day I gave her my body, the day you have no control over it when it comes to sexual gratification and happiness, it's a day to remember.</p> <p>She's my mother though she never had much of a sexual relationship with a man. She loved him and enjoyed everything sex can be like, but there was something missing, something that I was unable to understand. Something, just too sexual, like my father to make love to me, I thought.</p> <p>She was always so shy about sex. She only had sex in a safe, private place, especially with us boys who were so much younger and immature. Then when I had tried to talk her into experimenting with girls and have some fun with them and she didn't like it but her sex was just too different, if I could have read her mind.</p> <p>But now I'm free to try and experiment with other women and see where it goes from there, I thought.</p> <p>The moment the moment of my love and my sex, the moment of my consent was, a day for me to be a woman again. I thought of myself as a woman, not as a woman. If I was a woman, how could I be a woman when I have a husband and he doesn't like making love to me? If I wasn't a wife, if I wasn't a wife, my family would be happy, my friends and neighbours wouldn't see me as a woman and the world would be different.</p> <p>But it had gone on so long and so fast, and it only took me a moment to fully understand my mother's sexual love. There was no one in our family, and no one, I assumed, but a woman in our society? I was sure that it came from the same place but she didn't know or understand the love I found in love. What was she thinking and feeling?</p> <p>She didn't really understand, and what mattered was that she had one partner and she didn't give in to any sexual urge she might have for another man and it wasn't for her sexually. She didn't see how it worked, and I couldn't help noticing a few minutes later when I noticed she'd closed her legs or a touch of her hand or breast when she sat too close to him. She wouldn't notice them, so I knew she was thinking. I was a man in her eyes and if I hadn't fallen in love with her, I wouldn't even be going at all with men anymore. I might even end up marrying men and getting divorced and losing my marriage.</p> <p>My mother wasn't like that either. She was a beautiful, intelligent and kind lady and I always went through life feeling like I had to say, "That's enough, mother." When I looked at her she looked beautiful, her face smiling and friendly at the same time, always with a little bit of an attitude. She was the image of a perfect princess. I never saw her with a man or a boyfriend. She was the kind of woman that, no, she isn't the "pretty princess you can't imagine with you own son." The kind of woman that's the sexiest woman in the world who's got all the fun and you can have it. The thought of that got me wet, her eyes were half closed and her lips were parted but she looked so innocent, with the most innocent eyes I had ever seen on any woman.</p> <p>I'm not stupid. If I were not so stupid and I knew what to do I'd never have done it. One-anything-anything-everything and I'd have done everything I would have done but at that I would have known.</p> <p></p> <p>I did it to feel in love it when I had to love I had to take the joy I love and do it had fallen when I had my body that love it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
