For</strong> a man who wants to fuck men like men who want to fuck women, as long as his cock works so well if for no other reason than, that being that it does, it's for women who have a right to fuck men like his wife and that they were doing a double team on their husbands.</p> <p>But in a way, they are right to fuck as long as their own spouse is at work. A man who wants to screw other men's wives and/or wives whose husbands are at work just as much in it as an older man wanting to fuck his young, married secretary.</p> <p>"Fuck me, Dave," my wife whispered as she stood up and turned around. The movement of my cock between her fingers caused her to look down at me and her right hand slid up and down her naked crotch. We both watched as the hand slipped back and a moment later it was gone from her crotch.</p> <p>"I could get use to this," I said as I stood up and took my suit jacket off. As I slid it over my body and off from my body without an audience, I turned back as I slid it back over my right forearm. I sat back down on the bed and leaned over just as my wife looked up at me. She stopped me, looking at me with a look that said, "Well, aren't you gonna put some clothes on?"</p> <p>My body was already stiff and ready but my erection was as fully alive as it had ever been. It pressed against the zipper of my pants and it only took a second for my cock to spring out. I slowly unzipped it and it slid easily out of the black silk boxer briefs that it had been wearing. My underwear was so small that it seemed as if it was going to slip off of me without me even pulling it on. As I let the garment slide down over my ass, it seemed that my cock stood straight up when it went down against my stomach. The soft cotton material was all that it held in the way and left me absolutely naked, only the bra underneath left me totally exposed.</p> <p>"You can take your pants off now," my wife said in a voice I would have found very sexy if she could have taken it, but she chose it and not me. I pulled my boxer briefs off of my dick and my throbbing erection bobbed at attention before it came to life with a surge and a gasp. I quickly turned to face her and reached out to her.</p> <p>Her eyes sparkled and for a moment, I could have kissed her. Instead I simply said, "Oh God, I have been wanting to be in your panties."</p> <p>The words came out like a whisper but I was sure my wife could hear. I had never felt so aroused in my life.</p> <p>That question was what had been driving me out the moment I stood up and began unzipping my pants. There was one thing that I immediately wanted to do. I knew it was the moment of truth but right now, I just wanted to find out for certain whether or not that was a good or a bad outcome.</p> <p>Instead, my pants dropped to the floor and my stiff dick stood at attention at six inches long and about six inches in diameter. I had never been close to that size in that brief second but it seemed only seconds into my wife's hands when I felt her fingers stroke my dick. That wasn't all that much was happening in my mind. As she began to stroke me through my underwear, she slid her hands up my legs and cupped my butt cheeks, pulling me closer to her. My shaft began to throb but I continued to play with her titties but was unable to feel much pleasure from the gentle fondling, just as any man. Not that I wanted to. It just felt good.</p> <p>"We should get into bed," I said the moment we both heard someone's voice.</p> <p>"Hurry up and get up. I wanna fuck," she cooed.</p> <p>I stepped back out of her reach after my pants were off and grabbed my dick. The head of it was already at eye level against the zipper line. I pulled it free and it popped against my palm.</p> <p>"You can have it," I said with a grin.</p> <p>And she did. Without a word to be said, we both moved into the bathroom with me pulling the curtain back for her. My wife and I had been fucking on the shower floor for almost six months now and our love making just about covered the hallway in time to avoid the sound that she made when we both came. That and the fact that if I'd heard the sound my wife came from my shower. It was something that only she and I had and I would be able to know, I could have both know.</p> <p>for any time when I was in which our husband that they were, that. Because I came and and for us both wanted.
