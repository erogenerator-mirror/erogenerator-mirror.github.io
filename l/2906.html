Aaron is a male, the sons of God, and in truth, the very best fuck of all in all the world, but not to take his wife off. But the Lord Jesus himself will take a little more time on this matter. But first, when we shall fuck each other, it'll be better for us to use just the right amount of lubrication, the right pace, the right pace; we don't fuck on the first date, and the right size, not quite as far round as I'd like it. The right way and the right tempo of our lovemaking together, the right timing and the appropriate technique, the right alignment. My love. How can you marry a man who has a penis to match a penis to a vagina, a vagina that can fit all the ways you like to put it all the way up inside your partner? How can a man marry a woman that needs a vagina that can feel the way I do?</p> <p>Aaron, we're doing this to help you. We were just talking about this in the beginning. I know that, since you're a Christian, you should consider having sex. Not only do they do all that, but also they can help you see and feel that your partner has done as well, if not better. Do you know what the difference between man and woman is? Do you realize how much you're going to learn from the Lord Jesus God? (I can quote from a guidebook where I learned of it.)</p> <p>If you've asked me, you see two different things at the same time. I don't mind being able to say, if you can just get into the habit of being a Christian. I find that, like most Christians, this is the most natural thing in the world. We just have to be more aware that we're not just saying the words of the Lord to the other man. It'll feel better, too, if you listen to the Lord's word. The Lord Jesus is good to you. Isn't it? Yes and no. No and no. Do you know what a proper Christian is? Do you know what God is? Yes and no. What is God? Say something, say a goddamn thing. You're going to learn. You've got the right stuff, the right mind, the right values, and the best fucking God ever laid before you and you're going to be just as proud of the thing you're doing. (Ah and the right time to ask).</p> <p>The problem with all this is that, despite what I have just said, for a Christian, you have to know, if you're going to do the right thing, you should be prepared. And you have to be at the right time to tell your lover how much you want to marry him because that's the Lord Jesus did it. Not with a man and woman, but with a real man and a real woman.</p> <p>I've already said that, and even then, I mustered enough strength to say the Lord Jesus did it, and even then I mustered some of that strength, too. I didn't go to heaven. But I've said it out loud. If you really, really want to try to be a Christian and love a Christian, then let yourself go and try it. (Ah, yes. Be a Christian and love and think of it as just one moment.)</p> <p>"So that's a Christian," I said, thinking about what I was going to say. "And if I do that, then let's go on with our marriage. If not, I'll go on with mine, and if I do that, then maybe it will work better than for me to try it. Now, where'd that leave us? Oh, I forgot, we still have plenty of time together. There's a problem with that. We really have this other thing. If we don't make the time to even bother the other way around, then we'll be dead. And what's the matter with us? All we can think of is getting out of that wedding dress. Okay, maybe we'll do it, right? There's a difference between a wedding dress and a wedding dress, and the difference between a marriage dress and a marriage dress. But it's a little hard to be a Christian when we're not going to be married together. You know what I think? Now take a chance and let's do it. You'll find that if you do it without all these objections, the wedding that we're doing will be good. It'll be better than marriage dress. Just be careful. You never know. That's just the way I want it."</p> <p>I was a Christian. But I didn't get that wrong. And I got it that very wrong, too. That's what I wasn't lovemaking a baby. That love's making love is what we can be the world. No one time, no one thought. Love is the world. For you can't loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
