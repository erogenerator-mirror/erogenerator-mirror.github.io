That was when she first noticed that she found herself in a kind of turmoil: in her mind, there was Mrs. Palmer with no clothes, her body exposed to her own young lover. It seemed as if a great distance to the sun! But then, the sex was so enjoyable, with her and with her lover, a man with an enormous cock, and the two of them were making love in the grass. How could they make love, in front of other people, that she had to come home? She decided that to take her own time and get used to what happened to her; to experience it for the first time with a lover. It had certainly been the most wonderful thing that anybody had done to her, and she was quite certain that, if it meant she never had to go back. She had not even had a moment of regret: a man had entered her bed, with his monster stiff cock filling her, and fucking her. She felt it in her own body, with in her lover's hot flesh inside her, inside him, and with her own fingers and tongue, for who was fucking whom?</p> <p>Just as she had her second experience with a man, and so it was with her daughter, she too was experiencing a third, with her father, but this time for her husband. She was happy as could be. But the excitement had not diminished, the passion between them was growing, and it was not just that he was fucking her. He fucked her. He fucked her very well, and she had felt him inside her, in her vagina, that time, which, if she was honest with herself, could not go off without climax. They fucked each other. There was no difference here.</p> <p>They fucked each other, they fucked their brains out, they fucked the world with their love. She knew that, in this experience, the word was to follow: "fuck" was to follow, if it meant she would be fucked. Maybe, it did.</p> <p>She was a different woman there, more sexually interested. She had never thought that she could see herself as so much different as it was: her daughter, her son, her husband, what difference could it make?</p> <p>She wondered why she felt that her husband was better, than her father. She wondered if that difference was because she had just realized that she was different than other women, even when she had known them well. Maybe that was because she was different with her body, and her mind, as well as her body. Maybe her mind, she had read about it, would not recognize the difference between being a woman and a man, who fuck each other, and what is difference?</p> <p>When she thought about herself; she had been with someone who was the best. She had come to the realization that she was different with her body. She was different than her daughter, with her sex, with her body and even with her mind. She did not know about the difference, but she thought it mattered when she was fucking.</p> <p>If they fucked each other, she thought, they would be the happiest woman on earth, and they would be doing what they both wanted, when they did.</p> <p>She felt a moment of sadness as she recalled their first fuck, when they had made love, and her daughter, who she thought was no different, was now making love to her husband, who was the luckiest man she knew, the king of her man, and whom she had loved with all her heart, and loved with all her soul.</p> <p>What kind of mother was she now? She did not want a child, but she did as she did in her own mind. She did not mind having a husband; not all that much, but to have a husband. She loved having a man. She loved having the husband to whom she could give her her own children. She loved being fucked by a man, with a man inside her mouth, with his cock, for she liked it too. She loved being fucked by her father, with his cock inside her vagina, and having a man who was not her father. She loved having her husband whom she had known to be no different. She felt a sadness that she knew that she did not know about: had she not known it, and never would have felt those same feelings, would she have been different, and with whom she had never wanted this?</p> <p>It was the truth. It was the truth, but not all of it. It seemed to matter in an age. It seemed to have changed.</p> <p>They fucked each other.</p> <p>She had found herself thinking of her husband, lying in her bed, wondering what it would be like to have a man. and to get fucked him, to whom she was now. her own, and to be alone with him. to have sex. the other men a man that. her. to love.. he didâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
