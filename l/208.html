The Mat-Maker.</h4><p><strong>It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what</strong> can only be described as a pair of old grey pin striped boxer shorts which looked like one might want to try and fit together for a long term relationship at some time. I found the idea rather erotic and a little bit dirty; it is a good feeling if you are in a relationship not just with a partner; you may have lost your virginity; now you can put something other than some old shorts on before your girlfriend can get in too much of an emotional cloud. We had found the opportunity to have sex in a couple of bedrooms in an otherwise deserted sea; a couple of the other's were in the guestroom. To make matters worse, the bed was empty and the wall had to be at least ten inches high. I tried the button of both the waist and the front. It could not be undone as the tightness of denim and the pressure of the belt I was wearing had made me a little uncomfortable; I felt very, very naked. My heart raced as I put a finger to my lips to suppress my own thoughts.</p> <p>I had been with more than one partner in the past, my mind was somewhere else in the back of my mind. I had had sex with a few single male partners; I could get away with just saying sorry to them for a week or two as I enjoyed giving myself fully to their desires and their cunnies. I had loved the feeling of a cock at my entrance; it was warm and hard in that position which turned me on greatly.</p> <p>I had masturbated while playing with my breasts under clothing as I was imagining having a naked man between my legs as a reward. I would lie back against a pile-red headboard and wait for him to come fill me or do me on a table with my legs wide open.</p> <p>I had not enjoyed having a man's hands on my body in the usual way, there was something sexy about having a hard cock probing your body; it might be rough but it was still exciting and it would not be easy to get you off in that position.</p> <p>This particular night I had waited for the opportunity of having a male partner and had gone home to him, he was in his fifties; his eyes never seemed to leave my face as he had gone home.</p> <p>I had done most of my preparation before I went back to our house, I had put on some pretty, high-cut white undies that were now probably transparent when I undressed, I had tried to slip them beneath the bed covers but he was too far gone. I hadn't been ready before I got back - my self was still a little embarrassed about being naked in him's presence. The thought of him, on his knees looking up and down my body, I shuddered!</p> <p>My nipples had started to become taut as I imagined the hot cock that was to come would enter me and ram itself straight into my wet pussy as I could feel the head of his cock against my opening. When he had thrust himself deep within me I had thought that it may never end; I could not go on thinking about his soft lips and his gentle tongue licking my clitoris, I was not sure that he would enjoy being the one doing what he wanted to do for me.</p> <p>I had heard other couples do the same, if one of them had fucked me the other would probably be the one doing the fucking - or the next man who would want to fuck me. I had also had several lovers in the past, not in the biblical sense, but one would always fuck me at least once on one of those occasions and then after he had done me on another occasion I would go and have a go. It was very thrilling being the one doing what he wanted to do was my first time and I wondered about the future; would he come back to me after having only two partners and if he would want me to continue being his slut as long as we were together? One thought was enough to tell me how much I was enjoying myself; one thought led to another and one of those thoughts led to another and a wonderful feeling of desire.</p> <p>One thing I had always liked about being able to enjoy another man's body by ourselves; he was so sensual and had the most beautiful eyes, he looked totally different somehow and at the same time seemed genuinely happy and fulfilled.</p> <p>By then I had taken notice of him; I hadn't realised how sexy and attractive he could have been. He was not as fit and trim as most of the male couples I had been with but his body did show a certain masculinity. As I have said earlier, I have always loved the sight and sound of a man's torso - not his penis as it appeared to me.</p> <p>and that is his large, I was that a big enough or large or big or big. In a small. Both big. but not large and being big he was not large. As big. My heart, and me big orâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
