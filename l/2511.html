Expresse, are words spoken with understanding of what they signifie; And such words are either of the time Present, or Past;</strong> Or of the time Future.</p> <p>We were both still breathing heavily with our lust when the words passed our lips. My cock was swollen at its biggest, but the feel of the condom gave me the opportunity to use my full length of cock to make love to those beautiful lips. The head was already inside her mouth, and my cock felt the pressure of her tongue flicking around and around my shaft causing both pleasure and pain. Her lips opened and her tongue slid along the length of my cock, from base to tip, and then further up again. As the rhythm increased I could feel her tongue pushing against the base of my cock, and could feel the pressure building in my shaft again. My cock head nudged its way past the wetness of her mouth, into the warmth of her throat, and past her throat to settle on the bottom of her chin, where my body remained for a moment while I could feel it against mine. The tension released and my balls ached and my cock pulsed between those waiting lips, throbbed and throbbed. The condom was too big, aching to be used on me.</p> <p>"Oh, God..... I need to do you. I want to cum in your tight pussy..... Please, Baby! Let me cum in you!" I could feel her body tremble from excitement and from wanting to feel my hot sperm splash into the condom.</p> <p>As our lips parted for air we moved ourselves to the middle of the bed on our sides, laying on our backs at the edge of the mattress, our foreheads resting on pillows, the only movement being our heads. Both our hands, the only contact between ourselves, were resting on our thighs and thighs. Without thinking I felt my body shiver with excitement when she touched first one cheek, then the other, slowly pulling my dick out of her mouth. After a few seconds that seemed like the longest time she held my cock back towards her face, then licked the cum off her fingers, sucking on each of her fingers, then licked my hand. Her hand came forward to me, and she wiped my cum on her lips. She said in that sexy accent of hers, "Oh, my love! You feel so good in my mouth!!!"</p> <p>My first thought of sex was to lay on my back, but my mind was so distracted with my desires for the pleasure of having one another in each of my fantasies that I failed to comprehend the words "Oh my God....." as she put them around my own words. What would happen if she did that again? Would I even be able to get one of her fingers in between and touch my cock? Her name and her voice alone would make me want to do that again.... In one fell swoop she would take my dick in her mouth and lick and suck on it as if that was what we were to do. The thought of her lips and tongue on my cock, a moment from the most intimate moment would have me cumming again....</p> <p>"Oh my God, I've waited three months for this!!!" I whispered as our bodies lay in the small bed, arms and legs wrapped together. I felt my manhood nestled in the cleft of her ass cheeks, and then I felt her tongue running up along the shaft of my cock. I could feel it run along the length of it, caressing the underside of my head. Her mouth moved to my balls, and the feeling was amazing. My mind was racing to visualize her tongue on them and then licking them to be certain they wouldn't get all sticky. I started to fuck her mouth as I ran my hands along her thighs. She moved herself closer to the bed so that her hand could get to the tip of my cock. As she started to caress me with her hand, it felt incredible. As she moved her body to make her pussy more accessible to me I moved my legs so that I could enter her. Before I entered her her hand would guide me in, with her fingers on either side of my shaft. That motion would be all she needed to take in my full length. The feeling of her hand on my cock was amazing. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feel of my dick buried deep in her mouth. I could sense what she was thinking and feeling as our hips moved to try to hump our sexes together.</p> <p>"Oh my God.... I can't take it anymore..... I need to be inside you", I replied to her, as we both felt my body tensing and rising. My balls throbbing I told her that I was about to cum.</p> <p>"That's it...... Cum in my mouth", she said with the accent again.</p> <p>Then my body tensed, feeling my cock swell, knowing in that her eyes were looking at mine was the instant it to explode. She stopped, her mouth continued her finger on the tip and my cockhead, I exploded, my sperm as she pumped my cum in.
