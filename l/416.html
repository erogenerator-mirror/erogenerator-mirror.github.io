A feeling of dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly</strong> and carefully was a one-time thing. But he and Pierre were really going to end their honeymoon today and were going to stay together at least 24 hours until his son returned.</p> <p>“The thing is, Pierre, that we can’t all always have sex, and we can always go to sleep with each other every night and have lots of sex,” said Dólok. “But with all the people coming back home over the next twelve days," Dólok continued, “the only way to go is to get us all some sexy sex.”</p> <p>“All right then,” said Dólok, “I want you guys to be naked, but not too close,” said Pierre.</p> <p>Then Pierre, still smiling, took me by the balls. Dólok picked me up and laid me on the couch. He unzipped himself. As he had a moment before, he was semi-erect. Pierre and I both had a momentary erection, which quickly subsided. Once, Pierre and I both realized that it would take only a few seconds for an erection to get hard again.</p> <p>Then it was Pierre’s turn to lay flat on the surface of the couch while I positioned myself over him. I had to give Pierre up. I was sure that his cock would fall out. But Pierre’s had already risen to erection.</p> <p>His cock was long and hard and pointing at the floor. His balls were dangling in front of his body. He was completely engrossed in watching me and his son, who had fallen from the ceiling and was now standing, naked, and masturbating himself. But I was still in a state of shock. And for a moment, I had a hard time seeing Pierre’s naked body. Now I knew that he would be the first to have his cock hard. And maybe not quite as hard. And maybe not quite as big. I thought what would it be like, being fucked by someone that big?</p> <p>I moved up and down on his cock, feeling the velvety fullness of the hardening, throbbing cock in my hand. Pierre lay down over Pierre, watching me with an open mouth. I was also excited that he was watching me. The sight of Pierre standing there nude in front of him, with a wet, hot tongue licking the head of his cock like a cat licking it’s lips, was really getting me aroused.</p> <p>”God! I’m so horny! I can’t believe that you and I are really fucking each other!” said Pierre,” I’m going to cum, too!”</p> <p>I didn’t have to ask Pierre to do anything else to get Pierre to move over as Pierre was reaching to take hold of my dick. Then we began fucking again. First we fucked on the couch, Pierre lying on his back. I did what I had to do, I bent over Pierre, and he bent over and began sucking my cock. He didn’t have the biggest thing in the world, but it was definitely the longest cock that I have ever had to offer. It was probably the most thick, if not the darkest cock that I have ever seen on a guy. But it was pretty damn hard. So long, so hard that when you finally get him on the bed, your cock is going to hurt if you don’t let go soon.</p> <p>We finished. Pierre got dressed and left. Then he turned to me and put his arm around me. He kissed me on the lips, then turned away and walked back to the closet. I wondered aloud.</p> <p>I could see Pierre watching me the whole way through the window. His cock had risen to his waist and was still up in his pants. I wondered what he was thinking. I didn’t have a lot of time to wonder. He got up and put himself back into his pants. I noticed that his cock had gone all the way out of his pants, but as he got dressed, it still didn’t budge. He got on his knees in the closet. His pants were a little tented. And that cock head was still sticking slightly out the top of his leg. I could see his balls, dangling down against his thigh.</p> <p>“How come he can’t walk?” I murmured, a little breathlessly.</p> <p>“They are just hanging there,” Pierre said Pierre, smiling at him, a little bit of a smile coming to his lips. It was so much bigger than a man. mine. he had grown. “s just hanging there. I said, looking,” . I mmm, too. Just hanging there’ are no’s so long—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
