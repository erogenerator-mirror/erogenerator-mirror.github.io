G. Wells </h3><h4>THE HEAT-RAY.</h4><p><strong>After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of fascination paralysed my</strong> mind.</p> <p>At last, after my own dream ended, and in a sense, I felt whole again.</p> <p>My first day of high school ended with a little skip to the end of the school year.</p> <p>I had a few friends in grade seven and an old college dormer named Billie Joe. We started off with nothing. Then, I made it my birthday. I went to my first school. Billie Joe and I grew older.</p> <p>Billie Joe came from a small town right around the State of Kansas City. As far as I know, he never went to school, never got a B.S. or a C. (But, he's smart enough to go anyway he wants). It's just that he never was popular. No one ever had to remind him of that, much as the rest of us can remember. I never understood how some dumb-asses could ever forget that.</p> <p>But, for Billie Joe, going to a school for the smart ones at his age was something else entirely. Billie Joe excelled, and in spite of having a big house to go to, it still wasn't so easy to pass his exams. And so, it didn't matter all that much to Billie Joe with his low grades in math and science.</p> <p>In addition to being smart and fast-talking, Billie Joe liked sports, but not in the same way that I liked football.</p> <p>And, for Billie Joe, it was a lot of fun. And, of course, Billie Joe hated sports. Yet, I got a kick out of Billie Joe telling me that he was such a dumb ass. Sure, he came on to all the dumb asses, but, Billie Joe also hated sports.</p> <p>And Billie Joe hated football.</p> <p>And I hate football.</p> <p>But, Billie Joe always insisted when we were in college, that he was a dumb ass, because it was all the way off his world.</p> <p>Billie Joe got himself a C for both grades and performance, which I guess you could argue is a very good thing when you're smart as hell. Billie Joe was smart and fast. But, Billie Joe's brains were just like mine.</p> <p>Yes, I could say that my brain was my stupid ass again, too.</p> <p>I don't know that anyone could ever see past my stupid ass. I'll say that Billie Joe was just as smart as I was when I grew up in middle school or even before. And, Billie Joe's brains weren't all that bad either.</p> <p>Billie Joe also didn't like sports.</p> <p>"Haven't you ever thought about what it's going to be like in college sports?</p> <p>And, Billie Joe was as dumb as I was, even though I could barely handle all the stupid asses that would go to games and cheer me up, anyway.</p> <p>"It might be nice, then," Billie Joe replied without really wanting to bother me.</p> <p>But, Billie Joe's brain was too weak to deal with that.</p> <p>"Okay," I said.</p> <p>"You'll always be smart, and you'll always be smart."</p> <p>"Humph," Billie Joe sighed.</p> <p>"Hey, listen you dumb ass."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>Billie Joe laughed.</p> <p>"You heard me: you'll always be smart. Humph."</p> <p>"So, there is one thing."</p> <p>"Yeah," the smart man said, with a shrug.</p> <p>"I just want you to know that I'm a good guy. I just want to forget you ever existed. But, I might as well leave you alone. I'm sorry.</p> <p>"Okay," Billie Joe said.</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed, not wanting to do it again, especially after having to teach a dumb ass lesson to my stupid ass.</p> <p>I don't know why, but Billie Joe always had a hard time keeping his head above water. He would go away for a little while, sometimes, sometimes not, never giving me another chance in telling me how I'd ever be an idiot.</p> <p>And it was funny to hear my dad say that, because it was a funny moment to break the bad guy. But, it wasn't funny, though.</p> <p>"What's up, Dad?" Billie Joe asked, as if he didn't mean anything like a little Tommy.. . in any other than that a hard time was fine. I could happen to fall for Billie Joe. no matter, but not have to take the smart. that way he wished. the whole. a biter of a man.. I do the good, a time for a little. and not. a day. not a night. the same or my ass. no more, a dayâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
