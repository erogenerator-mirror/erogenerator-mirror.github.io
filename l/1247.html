"Mr. Marris, its so good to see you! Where is the man you saw working the day after I left the store today? I want a new watch, please." He asked, and when he said the words, his gaze dropped to the watch hanging on the wall behind him. He held out his hand to see it again, and this time it wasn't a man holding anything in his hand to make it. This time it was something else, he saw again something other than the watch, but it was a man's watch and he saw it like this before as well. They walked to the chair, which was at the foot of the bed, and they sat.</p> <p>"May I sit down?" He said, looking at the watch while he took off the cloths of his uniform, and they walked to the bed. There they sat, next to each other and the watch remained in one hand. He noticed the man's eyes drop away from the watch and down to his chest and smiled as they went to their knees. He leaned forward, touched his lips to the watch and kissed his wife. She smiled at him and then he rose, turned off the watch, and they fell onto the bed, their lips meeting once again after a few moments. She kissed him again as he turned her onto her back, her eyes closed at first, but then opened once he was on top of her. He started with her mouth by softly kissing her and when she opened her eyes, she smiled. He kissed hers, and when they parted, he kissed that lovely, beautiful mouth of hers. He put his hands under her shirt to the hem, and she giggled, enjoying the touch of his hands to her body. He pushed her shirt upwards, over her head, and she willingly raised her arms in the air to let him pull it down. As he pulled it off her body, he saw their naked breasts before him, and they continued to kiss each other as he stripped off all his clothes. He pushed her panties down her legs and she helped him by removing them, too, before climbing up on the bed next to him. He looked at her body while he removed the clothing of hers, and seeing that she enjoyed it, he smiled at her body as he took down her panties. He kissed her, and their mouths continued to play as he removed her top and her bra and when he was done, he pulled them both off, too.</p> <p>Her smile grew as her nipples got harder and she pushed him back just a bit. She kissed him again as he was looking at her and he could taste her arousal in her kiss, and his eyes took in her nipples as they stiffened. He moved down her body slowly while kissing her all over her body, moving towards her tits. There was a change in her breath as he worked his way down her body, and when he did, she moved to the edge of the bed as he licked her nipples, and she moaned into her chest as he did this. She reached out her hands, pulling his head to her chest, and he could now feel her breasts in his mouth. He kissed and sucked softly, but he went lower because once he touched his tongue to her lips, her mouth opened wide when she moved her tongue to it, and he felt her tongue touching his tongue, moving against it. He moved his tongue down as far as he could go, until he couldn't take anymore and moved his tongue inside her. He licked her deeply for several moments as he felt her tongue move against his tongue, and after he was satisfied that he'd done his job, he moved down, kissing her breasts slowly as he went. He touched her skin with his tongue, feeling her body tremble in his hands as he touched her. After a few moments, she started moving her hips forward to encourage him, and her breathing grew as he touched those sensitive areas of her body that the tongue made contact with, and when his tongue finally came up, it slipped under her and she opened her eyes and then pulled his head up, holding it against her body. She moaned softly as she pulled her tits from his waiting mouth, and he moved up her body, kissing her lips while his hands caressed her stomach, her breasts, and even down her legs. When his hands reached her crotch, while he was kissing inside her mouth, her hands pulled his face into her and moaned as she felt herself getting wetter by the moment as he pushed aside her panties.</p> <p>She felt him remove his shirt, and she asked him to remove his pants as she opened her eyes once again, looking at his body, and he smiled before taking off his pants, too. He stood naked of his underwear and left on the bed now, and the only in the watch, but the watch and the watch, and watch of a sight that he stood, and watch he was his penis had the watch was the watch as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
