The author of</strong> each paper has the name of Annelisa Bann. (I'm the author). If you know of any others, please give me the name of this author. There's no way to be sure, because we're a little self deprecating.</p> <p>All characters are over 18.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>All the way back to my home, back to the present...</p> <p>All I could think about was what it would be like to fuck him! I'm sure I could have. If I'd ever had any doubts, this would be the perfect time. I knew that he would. This guy had no idea what was going on, I knew that. But his wife, Kelly, and their wonderful family didn't matter. All I had to do was just get him inside me.</p> <p>I was almost home when I heard him call out, "Hey, honey, have fun..."</p> <p>I stopped and tried to walk past him. However, his eyes were on my hands. I looked at him and asked, "What?" and he started. I knew that I needed to say my piece. After all, I could still have an orgasm but couldn't actually have one.</p> <p>He was looking down my top with his hand under it. His eyes were full of lust, all over. I wasn't sure if he was aware that I had nothing on underneath my top. When he finally spoke, he told me, "I'm going to put my cock inside you."</p> <p>"Okay," I replied. I didn't know what to say to that. Would he really? How would he fit his cock inside me? I knew that what we'd been doing was wrong, but I couldn't deny that I could love it.</p> <p>As he pulled his cock out, I put my hand on it and said, "Why don't you put the rest of your hard on in me?" That made him smile. He stepped past me and slowly started undoing his pants. His cock was hard again, and I could tell that he enjoyed the attention that it got from his wife. As he pulled off his pants, I let him pull me down. He was standing directly over my face, his cock in front of me.</p> <p>"Go suck my cock, honey."</p> <p>I didn't say a word. I just put my hand on his cock and pulled as I looked at his eyes. They were staring straight at mine. Slowly, it took him only the first few inches and my lips came out and then slowly back in. This was making me so horny and excited. I began giving him pleasure with my mouth. His taste was intoxicating. His cock felt good. I loved making him do such naughty things, even for me. We'd always been a good match.</p> <p>He held my head and started fucking me with his cock. It was almost like a porno for him, but not at all like an actual fucking. This was the fantasy of my life. It was what I needed. I grabbed his ass with both hands, trying to pull his body closer.</p> <p>"Fuck! I love the way you fuck!" he said. "Take that cock! Fuck me! Fuck my cock!" I was practically chanting. "I'm going to fuck you!"</p> <p>He pushed it into me harder and began pushing it all the way in. The feeling of him inside me was incredible.</p> <p>"Damn! You're still not done." He said, pulling it back out. I couldn't wait to feel him inside me again so I just continued sucking and pushing my head up and down.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! I'm sorry, but you're not done, are you? Take your cock out, honey. I want all of your hard cock inside me."</p> <p>"Not yet. Your mouth is still too tight."</p> <p>"Not yet." I pleaded. "Fuck me. Fuck me, honey." His cock came out the same way it had before from my mouth, but it wasn't the same. It was a little different that he was fucking me. More forceful. More urgent.</p> <p>"Come on!" he shouted as he grabbed my hips. I felt his cock move forward some more. "Take all of me in your mouth and throat, honey," he said. I took all of him in, but it wasn't the same. The thrusting was intense, but still good. I felt like I'd never been so filled. He started fucking my mouth, but he wasn't fucking me, though, I could feel his cock moving out again and again in my throat. I couldn't take all of him in, it felt so huge. "ah it couldn't stay in", and "it's too much" and his cock, butth, ".I couldn't let's notth ".it ".
