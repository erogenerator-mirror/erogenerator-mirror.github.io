Now that thou hast taken these names upon thee of good, modest,</h4><p><strong>true; of emfrwn, sumfrwn, uperfrwn; take heed lest at any times by doing anything that is contrary, thou be but improperly so called, and lose thy right to these appellations.</strong></p> <p>He took her hands in his. “Pleasure to be so touched in the hands of a Master’s woman.” He leaned down and kissed her lips. She gasped and kissed him back. He continued kissing her. “We both know, she has brought a woman’s love of a man of power, but to be so aroused as to be the cause of love?” There was a look of surprise on his face. “You have been the subject of our most sacred of desires?”</p> <p>She did not react. She looked into his eyes, and they were not the color of her skin they were when she was crying. She was frightened, she was drunk from the wine in her. “I’m in love with both of them.” The look in his eyes was that of a predator. “I don’t know what to say.”</p> <p>“Of course you will,” he answered. “You see, we’ve been married a long time, and after we get home, I will marry your woman on a permanent basis. I know how to give you pleasure, and I know how to fuck her without losing the ability to talk, or think about work or anything. I don’t know how to love you, and I love being able to give you pleasure.” He kissed her on the mouth. God help him, she could not control herself. She kissed him back. This was not love, this was lust. “So, are you in love with my woman?” She smiled. He stood for a while, watching as her hands caressed his body.</p> <p>He leaned closer, and kissed her. She kissed him back hungrily. It was not passion. It was lust. It was more passion than sex for her. He opened his lips and took her tongue in his mouth. She held his head and kissed him, pulling him down toward her. He felt her hand on his cock. It was not hard or angry, just steady, the size of a small cucumber. She gently guided it toward her. Then, he felt his wife’s tongue run itself against his cockhead. It was soft at first, and then very hot. She licked in circles around his cockhead. He moaned. When he was rigid again her tongue danced across his cockhead, and he shuddered and pushed his cock into her mouth. She let his cock go and ran her tongue down the vein on the underside, and then down again. When he came she sucked his cock hard into her mouth, and held all of his cock down her throat until he was again ready to shoot. Then she sat up and looked at him.</p> <p>“Did you love feeling my mouth on your cock?” she asked</p> <p>“I guess,” he answered.</p> <p>“And you wanted her? Then I see, it must be something for you not to love me. I do love you. I have to have it. But not only love, which I just can not bring myself.” she said in a husky voice.</p> <p>“Yes,” he said.</p> <p>He took a breast. He was sucking a nipple. She held his hands, and guided them to the others, holding his. She kissed his lips, and he had his own kisses. Then he touched her nipples, and she responded with a moan. He moved his thumbs to touch her erect nipples. She closed her eyes, and he saw the joy on her face.</p> <p>“I want to make love to this woman. I want to fuck her.” As he spoke, he had unbuttoned his pants, and there were a few wet patches. He was naked and kneeling behind her as he sucked on her breasts, kissing her neck and ears. He was driving her crazy with lust, and she realized that she wanted to fuck him. She raised her ass, and he lifted it, and she slid his cock into her wet pussy. She moaned. She felt his fingers on her nipples. He was pinching them as he rammed his cock deep into her pussy, hard into her pussy and deep into her mouth. She arched and moaned again. It hurt, but she did not move away. He kissed her deeply and felt his own breath on her hair. He moved against her back to fuck her. He moved his body down her back, and his cock pushed deeply into her pussy. She closed her eyes as her eyes closed, and she felt him pushing and thrusting in and out of her vagina as she lay on the bed. his back as she opened her legs, pulling him toward her, drawing him from each down. It was wonderful, she said. Her eyes were filled with fire as she wanted. They were closed, for his cock in her hands—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
