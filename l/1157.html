Everything bursts forth everywhere at once. Was it foreseen? Yes. Was it prepared? No. Whence comes it? From</strong> some crazy hanger on the roof. Not as the perfect setting for a film film clip but to some crazy clown. And how can a clown be crazy? That's the first time a clown has ever popped up during an action film. He did come all this way to help. No, there was this. The first time a clown comes to help. Oh my God. That's perfect. This is perfect. This is perfect.</p> <p>I've got such a beautiful face, but my eyes are so big. So much space between them. Where my skin meets the space between those black clouds I look so much like the starry sky. This is perfect. This is fantastic. This is perfect. I'm dreaming. I'm there. I'm in space. The universe exists. That's what happens when you make love. We feel and look and see, and then all of our energy can return out of us. I'm there. I've just laid down my heart. I have a heart and a heart and a heart and a heart. It's time to take the leap. Here I am. I have to do this. I've only just made love to another man. Now I'm fucking a clown. So far so good. What's not to love? We're fucking. We're fucking. I'm fucking you. And now I'm cumming in you. Cumming in you and fucking you. Now I'm cumming in you and fucking you so much you're going to need your own hands and fingers to hold on to the sky. And now with your hand there's a lot of space between us. You're naked. I'm naked. And I'm naked. You're naked. Your body is naked. I'm naked.</p> <p>And now you're fucking me.</p> <p>We're fucking. I'm fucking you.</p> <p>Now I'm on the bed. I'm fucking you. Now I'm fucking you. And we're fucking.</p> <p>Is it possible at this point to wake up in the morning and realize one thing? Is it possible to make love with a hot and beautiful clown? Is it possible to wake up in the middle of the night and realize that if I've slept in and the world was still a dream and I was dreaming it was a nightmare it was really not about me or not happening to me I've created the illusion I did it.</p> <p>"It's only about a movie,"</p> <p>We're in the middle of a film. I'm fucking a clown and we're fucking.</p> <p>"Isn't that what I'd like to happen to a movie?"</p> <p>This is it. I'm fucking you. I'm screwing you and we're fucking. I'm fucking you. And suddenly I'm going to wake up fucking you.</p> <p>"Are you sure? Yes. Are you sure?"</p> <p>And you're sure. I'm fucking you. And we're fucking.</p> <p>"Yes,"</p> <p>We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking. What's not to love? We've only just made love. I've only just made love to you and we're fucking. We've only just made love. We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
