It was only through her door that I could see through the darkness. We were on the bed. Her clothes; I was taking off hers. Her underwear; I was taking off them. And I was standing on my knees; both taking off her jeans and panties.</p> <p>Then, a moment earlier, I saw something. The light. It was a picture. It looked about the size of her finger print on one of her hands.</p> <p>I looked into her eyes. And I noticed the picture reflected away from the camera in the middle of the night: one in front of her left hand. The image wasn't blurry and it reflected a light; it wasn't dark. But it was bright.</p> <p>I stared into her eyes.</p> <p>"You're not naked," she'd said.</p> <p>I didn't answer; I don't know. Maybe I was lost in my own world, but I didn't hear her ask me to strip.</p> <p>"Aren't we just playing?" She'd said.</p> <p>"If that's what you're saying, yeah, I suppose so." She wasn't wearing underwear. Her right hand was rubbing my chest and the right hand in my crotch. "Or maybe not, that's a bad idea." Then, she said, "You better get your clothes off, you idiot."</p> <p>I was naked and I was so hard I thought I'd explode, but I didn't do one thing to hurry. I slowly shed my clothes. And I peeled down my sleep shorts, the ones that I wore to sleep. My dick was hard, but I didn't want to hurt the feeling—I didn't want my wife who was about to do the unthinkable.</p> <p>It took just a few quick strokes for it to become erect. But by the time I pulled my shorts off and my underwear off, my cock was standing at attention, right in front of her face. I was looking at her with my hard on, and as I watched she was looking away, but when she looked back she was looking right at me, a smile on her lips.</p> <p>"I'll do anything you want." She said.</p> <p>Then she looked back at the camera: one hand reaching up and holding my dick, the other in my hand.</p> <p>"There's only one thing left to do."</p> <p>"Anything I want."</p> <p>Her hand reached up to my nipple. It was hard and sensitive. And it wasn't the first time I'd been touched intimately by a girl; the first time I'd been touched by a girl in just the right position; the first time I'd touched anyone outside of a book store. But even then it had been the first time I'd be masturbated by a girl I'd watched in the act of making love.</p> <p>And my fantasy was coming true now, her hand on my nipples, on my cock. Not as good as before, of course. But my dream was coming to life right now. She was looking at me, looking up at me with that big brown brown gaze of her eyes. And with it, the lust within her was just not what I wanted.</p> <p>"Anything," I'm not sure I could even manage as I watched her hand start to stroke me.</p> <p>With each stroke my eyes were looking at her, looking right at her, feeling my own eyes burning into her, feeling it. And after a while—and I don't know how many strokes she was making on my cock—I felt her fingers on my stomach. I could feel them as they slowly rose lower under my tummy—up the soft curves of my stomach and all the way down until they were at the bottom of my cock, right where it disappeared into the soft flesh of my thigh—her finger tips just barely touching my ass.</p> <p>And her fingers reached the base of my shaft. And up until they touched the head of my prick. And I felt the tip of her finger pressing gently, and felt the warmth of her hand, her fingertip, on the tip of my dick.</p> <p>"Anything." I said.</p> <p>"Anything," she said as she slid her other hand to the base of my hard on. She slowly slid her finger from the head of my dick, and she took a finger from each hand, slowly rolling my balls in their sac. I could feel my dick rising up and back down. There was no friction but a steady, gentle rubbing. And she'd already started to go slow and teasing by taking the time to just touch my penis, her finger, at the sensitive head until it was aching.</p> <p></p> <p>down to her finger tip, the bottom. And then back up and then into the top, so that the head and when to the slit. And she touched her hand, and the tip—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
