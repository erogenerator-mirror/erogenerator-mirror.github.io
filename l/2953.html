I lay on my back, and lay on my back. My penis lay in the midst of her pubes, which were on my upper thighs, and lay at the base of her vagina. She lay her head on my chest, her eyes closed, her hair tickled my body, and her hair felt sweet on my face. I reached my arms around her body. As my hands reached her waist, I pushed her legs apart and slid my fingers into her labia. "You're wetter, you slippery, you lovely, pretty virgin pussy, than you were before," I whispered.</p> <p>She smiled, and smiled. We lay there for a while, and each of us felt what the others body felt, so we knew what each of us wanted, so that each of us knew what the other needed and then came to the surface. It happened in slow motion, the first stroke, the last from the beginning. Our passion and desire grew, as did the need and desire to have one another. We were the same: beautiful, virile, sensual, happy, full of sexual attraction and joy and desire. Neither was to be mistaken for one another forever in this act of intercourse. We came together, at last, on the table, in my bedroom, with the window open and the sunlight shining in on us, and we kissed and we explored.</p> <p>Afterward, we lay together together, and I explored her body. I touched her and caressed her. I touched her clitoris with my finger, and I caressed her anus. I played with her hair and touched her neck and her jaw with my fingers and her eyes were closed. I kissed her on her mouth, and moved down to her lips. Her face opened. Her eyes opened wider. Her mouth opened; her eyelids fluttered. She reached her arms around me, and her lips moved my lips to hers. Our tongues danced, and we tasted and explored each other, and then we kissed.</p> <p>We were in my bedroom. We were in my bed. I was in the bed with her. In the nightgown against her skin: her body against me, my body against hers, my skin on hers. I slid my hand down and gently caressed her left breast. Her nipple was erect. Her nipple was erect. My hand continued lower. It glided over her navel. She reached the tops of her thigh. My fingers moved over, down, down between her legs. She opened them. My fingers caressed her vagina, and I caressed her vagina. My fingers touched her clitoris. "Yes," she breathed.</p> <p>My fingers found the entrance to her vagina. I pushed it out. In the dim candle light, I saw her clitoris appear and grow. I watched it grow and be excited to grow. It rose and hardened. It opened. "Oh, yes," it said. I caressed it with my finger. I stroked it. I caressed it.</p> <p>Her clitoris was so swollen. I reached it and gently rubbed and caressed it. "Yes," she said. Her body moved against me. I caressed her with my finger. I caressed her clitoris. She moved in my bed. She spread her legs as wide as she could. She stretched her arms around me. She caressed my face and my neck. She touched me everywhere. I could feel her nipples and her clitoris and her vagina and her vulva were touching, touching, all around each other. I moved to her head, kissed her with my lips, her mouth. I kissed her in the dim light, my hands caressing her face, her neck.</p> <p>She opened her eyes. I kissed her eyelids. I looked at her nose: her eyelashes. Her nose. Her lip. I reached over her hand. She touched my face with my fingers. I stroked her cheek with my fingers. I reached down towards her breasts, kneading, caressing them and her nipples. I knelt between her thighs, and caressed her body. She reached down and caressed my penis. I stroked and caressed her vagina. I ran my hand and fingers on her clitoris. She touched my penis and my fingers on her clitoris. I ran my hand between the lips of her vagina. Her clitoris was swollen and was protruding from the hood. I pressed it. Her clitoris grew. It was a lovely hard nub and it began to swell. I caressed it as I caressed her vagina. I caressed her clitoris. In the lips and labia and the labia. "Yes," she cried and sighed. I caressed her breasts I stroked and caressed, kissed. The whole bodies, breasts.
