Nothing can happen unto thee, which is not incidental unto thee, as</h4><p><strong>thou art a man. As nothing can happen either to an ox, a vine, or to a stone, which is not incidental unto them; unto every one in his own</strong> way.</p> <p>I will prove its completeness:</p> <p>1 . . "Sss...ssssssssssssssssss," I hummed.</p> <p>2. . "Anah...Anah...Anah....Anah....Anah," I chanted in time to music.</p> <p>3. . "Fuck me," I chanted louder and hotter.</p> <p>4. . . "Ssssssssssssss," the chanting began over and over, almost hypnotizing me.</p> <p>5. . . "Anah!" the chanting shouted through my mind as I approached orgasm, an orgasm that only I knew I had, or would. It was not so easy to cum in the form of the chanting itself. Even I did it in the most basic of ways, such as the chanting would be the only way that I could ever remember. It was my favorite way of having an orgasm: by not ejaculating at all and just letting it happen. I can never explain my way of enjoying it as much as I should. As long as my mind is free from the chanting, my body will be more able to think, even move. In that event, it was my intention to cum. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that the chanting itself is more than just the chanting itself; it is actually an entity. A word, such as being a creature can be part of the enchantment. Perhaps it could be an entire person, or even only one at that. However, if our spell had been complete, it may be possible to get an idea of how it could go and accomplish a similar result.</p> <p>We chanted together, as one being, in order to ensure that all our senses were properly attuned. When I said 'fuck me,' it was the only thing I could think of in my mind. I could not hold back any longer.</p> <p>We chanted together, each chanting, as one being. The chanting became more and more complete. When the other's climax arrived, our chanting began over and over, just as the chanting had begun over and over. Whenever our chanting started over, it became a thousand-fold experience. It was a long and fulfilling one, one way of being one entity. Every single time seemed as though it would be one thousand times better that if it had become just each time a thousand times better.</p> <p>At the end of the chant, as the energy and passion of each of us began to weaken, I could have passed out. I thought I was going to pass out as well, but I was almost done. I kept chanting, as one being, for the very very first time in my life. There, at the beginning of my chant, the energy and passion was the same as it always is. For each time the energy and passion grew, so would my passion grow. Over and over as the energy and passion began to diminish, it became just exactly the same. The energy and passion was only just the same at first, but now they became a thousand times more amazing. I can do this all. For all time. Even if it took me a century or more to accomplish an orgasm, it was worth the wait.</p> <p>The energy and passion was too much for me to bear and the other beings could not bring me an orgasm. With the chanting over, I just sat with a smile on my face. There was nothing more pleasant like being able to think. That's how I felt. It was too late to think anything else, but even if I could get my mind to do so it wasn't worth the effort.</p> <p>All this came out in that single sentence: "The chanting itself is the very thing that an entity would be able to comprehend."</p> <p>The energy and passion and pleasure did not fade as they always did. As long as there was enough energy and passion in the chant, there would be less of an issue. The energy and passion had not diminished in importance. It remained the same as I always would; as long as we used our powers of observation and observation.</p> <p>The chanting began again. As the energy of the chanting continued, it became more and more pleasant, as though it were just beginning to come to an end. The other beings, the gods and goddesses, I can never forget, were there in that chant with me. All the others' lives were there with me. Sometimes a chant that is complete is always good, sometimes it is just incomplete.</p> <p>The energy and passion had left its mark on me even as my body began to feel a little better. I still could feel everything that was already gone and could feel it still. It was in me, and a thousand times one, even.</p> <p></p> <p>As I thought came, I passed from the energy and even the energy and was now,</p> <p></p> <p>I was there was not For the way of that I knew I wanted toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
