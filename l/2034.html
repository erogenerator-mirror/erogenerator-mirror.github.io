As one that tosseth up a ball. And what is a ball the better, if</h4><p><strong>the motion of it be upwards; or the worse if it be downwards; or if it chance to fall upon the ground? So for the bubble; if it continue, what</strong>'s it be? Do you feel like having your name taken upon the ground? Are you in the throes of your most glorious climax yet; or will it be lost as a footnote as your name is gone? Now that all is clear and everything is still in focus, I'll continue. For the purposes of this episode, in this chapter I'll go back to our history of sexual experimentation, experimentation and discovery; so please, read on, and enjoy!</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>Chapter 1</p> <p>For the record, I am not very excited to have our sexual encounter to start something new with. I know my penis has always had an interesting length (well, thicker) than average; but what does a girl have to do with a length of nine-and-a-half inches? So to clarify, in this chapter of our history about experimenting with one of our sexual experiences, a girl, the only sexual partner other than ourselves, is allowed to fuck a length of guy, the only sexual encounter other than myself while having my own sexual encounter with another male. (I'm not talking about our sex, but the two of us.)</p> <p>"I didn't take any pictures! Please don't do it," I implored.</p> <p>"It's not that you shouldn't do it," she assured me before turning back to her work. "But I can't help you if you did it."</p> <p>"It's just that I don't enjoy it," I protested.</p> <p>"I didn't say I didn't like it. It seems so wrong. Why wouldn't I like it? It makes you feel bad, doesn't it?"</p> <p>"No," I pleaded.</p> <p>"That's right. It makes me feel dirty. To have some guy's tongue in my vagina just feels so right, doesn't it?"</p> <p>"What does it make you feel?"</p> <p>"It feels dirty, but that's normal for girls. I like it. I like doing it."</p> <p>"Are you happy for me to put my fingers inside you, too?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Why is that?"</p> <p>"Because it's my turn to do it."</p> <p>"Really? You're really excited to do it."</p> <p>"Yes," I answered.</p> <p>"You don't have much experience doing it," she said, as she continued to work on a second of my penis.</p> <p>"I...I don't...I didn't...don't want to...taste...what you were doing."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because...my...taste...has...to...stop."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I'm just saying, I don't need to, or want to," she said. "I just want to see what my tongue feels like. Please. I want to see. Please don't...to be...naughty," she said while sucking in air through her nose, while she continued to work gently on the head of my penis.</p> <p>"You just said you can't stop doing it," I protested. "That's a lie. I can't stop."</p> <p>"You're right," she said as she continued to work more of my penis inside her mouth. She continued to suck while still keeping my cock in her mouth. Then she raised up on her hands again to move my penis around her mouth while still sucking. I still held her gaze.</p> <p>"Do...did...that..." I tried to say.</p> <p>"It is called cunnilingus," she said and added in a matter of fact way, "I'll even make you feel dirty."</p> <p>Once again, she switched hands. She kept sucking while continuing to bob her head up and down. She looked up into my eyes, "Is this...you...you want...to...do that again?"</p> <p>"YES," I responded.</p> <p>"No talking. It's just...I...forgive...you...if that's what you really want."</p> <p>"Yes...Yes, I want to," I responded.</p> <p>"Good," she said.</p> <p>She turned to face me and with her hand still wrapped around my penis, she sat back upright to continue moving up and down, while continuing to suck up and down on the head of my penis. For a while, I just watched her with anticipation while she continued to bob up and down. After a while, she stopped and pulled her mouth off of it.</p> <p>"I want you..." she said.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure I could do this," she answered. "if you wanna...," she then she said smiling. "this...it..." then.</p> <p>" again." . , than I said. . She looked me. , "I want you..." then..." for you...like..." she smiled for...likeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
