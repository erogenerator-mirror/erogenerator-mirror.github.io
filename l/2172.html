He that hath not one and the self-same general end always as long</h4><p><strong>as he liveth, cannot possibly be one and the self-same man always. But this will not suffice except thou add also what ought to be this general end. For as</strong> a matter of fact, this man could be the same person in that moment also. We could be an item for instance. Yes, he is also immortal so it might be easier to do so. It would be so much more interesting. Perhaps not as interesting as your personal life or even your life with your immortal.</p> <p>"How are we ever even going to manage to achieve that," he moaned. And you are also not immortal.</p> <p>"I think something better we do for the most part," I said smiling.</p> <p>"I could certainly do with having a little fun in there" he smiled back looking back a little at me.</p> <p>"How can I help you," I said laughing at the look on his face.</p> <p>"I like to do the deed for some reason," he said looking down.</p> <p>"Just be careful. Your immortal might take notice of our act and it might be a little difficult to take," I said giving him the same look I have given him the once he started doing it.</p> <p>He looked back up at me just as I gave his cock a little suck in front of all the men. "I have to say, it could be hard for both of us when it comes to my pleasure."</p> <p>"If this is really important to you, it could be so difficult to do even if we don't make it happen," he said. I gave his cock a little suck. I liked it that he was trying to make it as hard as he could.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I want to, you know, do this," he said as he reached over to turn his cam on.</p> <p>"The way's okay. After all, the main point is why we could do this," I said looking down at him while giving him one suck even if it didn't have him cumming in front of all these men standing around me.</p> <p>"Just enjoy yourself, okay?" he said looking at me once more. He then leaned over and gave me a light kiss on the lips. "I'll try to make it easy," he said smiling.</p> <p>"Just be happy. It'll be nice," I reassured him.</p> <p>I smiled and pulled him into a hug. "I love you," I said.</p> <p>We hugged one another as he turned me over. I loved being able to do what I did for real. As he was getting in behind me, he began to kiss and lick all over my body that is to say I was kissing and licking all over him. His tongue probed my mouth and I didn't have to tell what he was doing. It felt heavenly.</p> <p>I was so turned on and horny. I had only been getting laid by one person before. And even then it was a single person and I had a total control like all this. Even if I had been able to stop it, I would still be a lesbian doing this. I think I should try this. I had done it before but it wasn't right. He was kissing all over me and it turned me on to see him giving his cock that much of attention. If he did it for real, how much bigger it is then? I was pretty sure he was bigger than average. It wasn't my first time with him.</p> <p>As he continued, I became really turned on also. I knew I should get mad at him but it just turned me on even more. After all, I did the deed for real. So much bigger than him. So much power over me. It's hard not to react to the way we are. It makes me feel so powerful inside. I even want to see him fuck me. But I don't think that's true.</p> <p>As I continued, his mouth began to move all over my stomach and breasts. And as he did this my mouth fell all over his, kissing my lips and sucking his tongue. I can almost say that I became addicted to him. I was really turned on when we finally left the room together. To be honest, I didn't know if it was me or him. We had not done the deed yet. But then, the sex talk seemed like a little bit too good an idea to stop now.</p> <p>As he was getting on his knees I said to him, "Please take of your pants and fuck me."</p> <p>It is just sex. I want to be in control. I want to feel him. If I can make him cum like that, I will go and fuck someone else. I never thought I would actually do something like this but it really does feel good.</p> <p>"Please," he begs. "I just want to feel you inside me."</p> <p>"You can have a turn if you want", I said giving him a seductually. "</p> <p></p> <p>A change is that," he said as he says.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Just fuck me.
