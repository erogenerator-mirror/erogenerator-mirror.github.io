There had been several of them, and some of them topless girls. Those girls had been a sight to beholds with their fair skin, and the dresses they wore did a fine job of showing off their bare titties and butt and legs (not to mention their legs had often looked rather feminine, and now they did in fact turn into a wonderful show). However, none the less, none the less, none the less (ahem!) it pleased them to see their reflection in a few people's eyes as they were carried through town on foot.</p> <p>"This is America!" The girl standing on the back wall of the square cried, "We've been here. And it's so far out!" She smiled up at the faces of the people standing beside her as a woman of almost equal ages in her dress stepped forward to kiss the head of her date. She looked over her shoulder, and in the distance came out to greet her as she approached, and they shared a tender moment with each other.</p> <p>"I've been dreaming of you all this time, and here we are," she said softly, "I've finally got to get to know your friends, and I'm so glad it's all over. They've all got great memories... I'm going to enjoy spending time with you for quite some time."</p> <p>"It doesn't have to be over, does it?" The girl in her dress asked, "You've made quite the impression on other men. How well do old men look, anyway?"</p> <p>"Nah, I'm an old goat," she said, "So I get my fill here."</p> <p>Then, turning her head to face the couple standing there along their way, "How long is this going to last?" the woman in her dress asked.</p> <p>"I guess we'll need more time to get to know each other," she giggled, "There's a reason my name is Tessa. Tessa, this is my friend, Tessa. Tessa, I've finally made it with you. It's going to be alright. Believe me... you're going to enjoy yourself."</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>The next day, October 29th, 1095 A.M.</p> <p>It was a bright sunny day, and Tessa, a young peasant girl from the south of the U.S., whom the travelers who were following in the carriage looked so beautiful when their eyes began to rove over her. She had longish brown hair in a short bob with a few bangs, and she dressed very conservatively in a pleated blue dress of pale blue.</p> <p>As soon as she stepped across the carriage to meet her friends, the wind picked up, and a cloud covered the countryside in front of them. Her figure was indeed more voluptuous than most younger girls her age, and she looked delicious in her bare feet and dress. She wore glasses and dark brown hair, and the dark brown that flowed down her face showed her interest in every male eye in the city, even of the servants of The Lord of the Host.</p> <p>Tessa had met her friends on the way to her new home in the capital city. She had also caught up with their parents before they left for the west coast, and she also saw how her friend, Tessa, spoke to their father, and who his father was, and whom his father was, and how their father had given her a new life and all her own. Tessa herself had become the only daughter of her father's family.</p> <p>She walked with her friends to a nearby street and sat down to greet the people there. There seemed to be the usual crowd of young people, but quite a few of the men of the same social group, and a few of the women. She saw many children under the age of puberty and in very shape under their clothing. A few girls from the east had already graduated from their classes and were entering college, and a few of the boys she knew had made it to the upper class colleges she had to attend as well. Another few were from the south, and she had seen many of them in skirts and dresses, and some of the men at the center still wore their hats and bowties on a daily basis.</p> <p>She stood up and walked towards a group of men whose faces reminded her of a kind of ancient pagan and pagan gods who had been buried in the dust of their mortal life, so she could only assume it was an older group that belonged to their father's family. The men were also wearing their dark blue robes of golden and red robes of dark brown robes, and gray fur, the oldest of the same hue in the family she had been treated as her mother, who her sister. Tessa of the other friends she was as a goddess of the sister of God of The Lord of the faith in Paradise Kingdom—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
