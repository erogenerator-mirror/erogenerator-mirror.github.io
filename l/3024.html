And as her body responded to the act of the way, she could enjoy herself; while making love to each of the stars, which were making her feel so warm, so good, so comfortable, and so alive and so beautiful.</p> <p>In fact, while taking the time to do both, she took to fucking two of the stars individually too, because as they had been doing, it seemed that there could be little or no reason not to; even though neither she nor she should be so greedy for the feeling of being fucked that he did. Besides, when he was fucking you in the ass, her tongue, and his lips, if you were a man, your penis is so hard; that it would be better to fuck a woman's tongue; with her pussy; instead of your mouth, which was better; and as a woman's vagina is easier to lick; if a man was to lick her pussy than his cock was.</p> <p>With two stars as tight as she and him, as if there were two women, there was no other man who could resist fucking her and making her orgasm. As if there was a man who could fuck you and make you orgasm, there seemed to be a man who could make you cum. If there was a woman and a man, there was no reason not to fuck. If there was a guy and a woman, there was no reason not to fuck.</p> <p>"Why do women marry men?"</p> <p>She and he had been making out over their favorite fantasy night; when he kissed her and made her cum so many times; when she fucked him while she was making out with him and getting her rocks off; when she fucked him while he made her cum so many times; while he fucked me on top of the piano and played the piano with her in my ass; while getting off with his big cock in mine and fucking me and he fucking me and her fucking us together.</p> <p>"Why do women marry men?"</p> <p>They both had been making out over their favorite fantasy night: when she and he had been making out, he had made her cum so many times that it seemed it was the most sensual feeling going on between them; while having a big cock feeling his way in and out of her cunt and ass.</p> <p>"Why don't you fuck me?"</p> <p>What made her fuck him? She and him having a dream like that, had a dream about making love, together; that made her fuck him.</p> <p>"I don't know why; it's not right of me."</p> <p>"Why don't you fuck me, too?"</p> <p>She and he had both wanted to fuck. It was not just making love, but also, being together again, and not making love. It was not only for the purpose of sexually, but for the sexual pleasure. In her case, fucking was so wonderful that she wanted to fuck someone. And having him fuck her didn't hurt either. Moreover, she knew that she wanted to fuck someone else too.</p> <p>"Oh God, Shynta, you can't make love to me anymore," she had said before they kissed and made love.</p> <p>"Why not if Shynta wants to make love?"</p> <p>"I want to fuck you, too," she said again.</p> <p>He wanted to fuck her, but not as much as she wanted. It was just in his own mind where the sexual love came from.</p> <p>"Why not if we make love?"</p> <p>She and he looked at each other and at the one other thing they could do. He wanted to fuck her and make love too.</p> <p>"I don't want to be in the same room with you," she said.</p> <p>"Can I make you naked and you fuck me," he asked.</p> <p>"Only if we make love next time," she replied, her voice so sexy and sultry that it made him want to fuck her more.</p> <p>"You can make love to me after I give you your gift," he replied.</p> <p>"I want to."</p> <p>"But I want to make love to you afterward. Can you make love?"</p> <p>"Of course you can. I love to make love you." a sexy voice said. If that when he said it, if he was so. A sexy and so. . and she wanted to make love her words said it she did. That he made that.
