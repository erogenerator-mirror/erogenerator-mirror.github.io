Man is the second. Such being the case, and a convent having happened to be on our road, it</strong> seemed appropriate that our book's entry was the result of some mutual agreement between us. It was the first thing I wrote. You will be able to read it tomorrow.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"It's so beautiful, you're home," I said to myself, "and I love your house." I said softly to her and stood up. She made no effort to get up as I stood up, standing next to me, holding my hands while we kissed. "Yes, that is wonderful," I said, "but I don't think it is for me, no. I don't want to spoil." Still holding our hands, I pulled her toward the large bedroom where we undressed quickly. As we lay down in the large bed, both nude, we kissed and fondled and caressed each other more and more as I took turns sucking each of her nipples and stroking her pussy lips. I got up onto my knees and pushed her legs outward and began to lick and penetrate her lips which were as long as a man's finger would lead to the most wonderful, wonderful feelings.</p> <p>After enjoying what we had just done, we both went off to the kitchen for more tea. I lay naked on my back, and she had her feet on my shoulders, my cock sliding between her legs as she pulled my legs up. She bent my knees and lifted upwards, allowing my cock to rub against her hot and engorged labia which were just a bit open. As I was holding the base of the very beautiful cock, the thought ran through my mind:</p> <p>'A lovely, warm, and wet, soft place that I could use for anything, and I could do anything with it, and it could be whatever I wanted to, and there were people that I could be with, what I needed to have a good life with...'</p> <p>I moved a little on top of her and she lay back with her hands still stroking my cock and I put that lovely thing straight in between the lips and began to move in and out. I reached down and caressed two of her fingers which I pulled from my mouth and placed inside her pussy with her. I slowly moved her fingers in and out of her hole, sometimes going so deep that it took me a moment to get her finger all the way inside. It felt so good when I did that. I got up to my knees and positioned myself behind her and began to push that deliciously fat cock head to the entrance of her love tunnel.</p> <p>She let go of my cock and put her legs onto my shoulders as she leaned against her upper arms and began to lift her hips so my cock could enter even deeper into her heavenly place. I began moving my cock in and out of her, feeling it slip and slide through the soft, hot, wet, slippery membrane of her cunt. The combination of our bodies and the hot, moist, wonderful sensation of her sex had made me harder than I have ever been. She lifted her hips in time with the slow penetration of my cock and moaned every time my cock slid past it. I felt it bump against the membrane of her hole once or twice before she lifted her hips again. When her hips fell again, I took her hips in my hands and began to thrust deep and long into her warm, wet, wonderful place until my pubic bone felt it against hers.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she whispered, "that feels so good. Oh, God, I am so happy and safe this feels so good."</p> <p>So far, this is what I had expected to happen when I had been in the middle of a sexless marriage. I wanted to feel her hot cum again as I thrust hard and deep into her. Now it was different. For some long, slow minutes I continued to fuck her for all I was worth into the deepest place of her love canal. She was moaning and gasping as she pulled me down against her with her fingers holding my ass up.</p> <p>Suddenly she moved her hand from my ass cheeks to the side of my face and put her fingers in my mouth and said:</p> <p>"Suck my clit. Suck the very little bit of pleasure that I can feel. Don't stop until I say "Stop." Do you understand?"</p> <p>"Yes," I answered.</p> <p>"Tell me what to do. Tell me what feels best, what feels best, what feels best to you."</p> <p>"I want you to suck my clit until you feel the climax of my orgasm and then just lie there and let me cum. Just lie there and let me cum, okay?"</p> <p>"Whatever you want."</p> <p>"Yes, I will."</p> <p>"Sick. Now, my clit's time for you are over." no longer, no good. I want you are coming. Yes" time to come." , go back to come, again, come. It's for my name." , to come—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
