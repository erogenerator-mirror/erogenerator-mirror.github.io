One day Frederick said. ‘Kate! I am going</strong> to miss all of you after this party, just to see what happens when you get married.’ He said, laughing and turning on his heel.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Chapter Four</p> <p>Frederick is married to his wife Catherine. Catherine had just turned twenty-eight. She had told Catherine that they were to be married only a month before the wedding, and there would be no wedding present.</p> <p>So Catherine wanted that. She thought it was so unfair that she had just gotten married. The wedding had gone off without a hitch.</p> <p>She couldn't wait to get the ceremony going for her husband.</p> <p>Catherine arrived promptly at eight o clock on the dot.</p> <p>She looked stunning in her dress. It wasn't a one-piece affair, but it made her look even sexier. She looked radiant.</p> <p>A bouquet was placed in front of her as she walked over to greet her husband.</p> <p>She smiled at him. She was very happy.</p> <p>Catherine couldn't wait until her husband was ready to give her the wedding gift they had agreed to leave their husbands.</p> <p>Catherine walked upstairs with her fiancé, Justin, right after announcing they were starting a new life together.</p> <p>She knew when her fiancé left that she could never keep him.</p> <p>Catherine looked over at Justin, who had just come back into the room. She asked, “You can stay home and watch a movie tonight, but you'll have to get off work early. I think they're watching a couple of the movies I've rented already, and I know their favorite is 'Rise and Fall'.”</p> <p>“It will be fine.” Justin replied.</p> <p>After Catherine took her fiancé upstairs for his evening, Justin had to get to work.</p> <p>Before their meeting with the wedding planner, Justin had planned on spending four nights with his wife.</p> <p>Catherine had no idea that Justin would spend four nights with her. Now Catherine had seen two of his movies while he was working, and Catherine had seen his movies with other women. Catherine didn't want to have him in bed with her.</p> <p>That night a little after seven, Catherine had agreed to have him by the balls.</p> <p>Justin was a good kid.</p> <p>The movie was about the life and work that everyone else in their family was doing. Justin was very handsome and had a nice package, which he didn't mind. He had worked as hard as he could to make up for it but he wasn't looking to change that. The movie was really just about sex for a small town boy. With Catherine's husband, Justin was only too happy to spend as much time in bed with her as necessary.</p> <p>Catherine liked to have sex with Justin. She really did, but she thought she deserved it with her husband when that happened.</p> <p>Catherine was a very happy girl. Justin felt the same way about her.</p> <p>They were all a little buzzed about the wedding. They didn't want to cause any problems with the wedding reception afterward. Catherine thought their relationship was great.</p> <p>Catherine and Justin were so excited about the wedding. They were thrilled that they had finally got to watch a movie and be together.</p> <p>The movie was titled 'Buffy Goes To Heaven', which was pretty good for Justin. Catherine liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer, though.</p> <p>Justin had been dreaming of Buffy for months and had been wishing it was Catherine he was fucking.</p> <p>Catherine loved Buffy.</p> <p>Catherine looked like Buffy did. She has blonde curls, her hair was long and her body was shapely. Justin preferred Buffy.</p> <p>Catherine was the prettiest girl in the world. She has green eyes, and she had a killer body. Her tits were nice, but she had big nipples.</p> <p>Catherine was really into Buffy. She didn't bother wearing a bra or panties. Even in bed with Justin, she rarely had to take them off. Catherine usually got herself off with her fingers.</p> <p>Justin and Catherine had shared their first night, right after Catherine made his first big-night appearance in three years. Justin had been nervous.</p> <p>He had come home two hours before Catherine and he did the same. After that, he spent more time taking Catherine to bed than he did it himself. Justin had not thought he could go to bed with Catherine, if she asked him to.</p> <p>He was pretty sure Catherine didn't want him fucking her. No matter. His way. He wanted sex, or not. He had been dreaming of never getting it in Catherine before this. was her. "I was. . he. She was "The sex.</p> <p>"The prettier" He thought he needed to be happy to her. that his love him. .
