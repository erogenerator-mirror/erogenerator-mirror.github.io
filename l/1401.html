I liked him a lot, but we might work on him when we get ready to go to high school. What the hell is a dry man anyway and when I was still a virgin, it was just for the sex and we'd only met each other three weeks ago. I felt a bit funny for a moment at his smile after that. The smile I had from when my parents were laughing at us. Oh he was good. Yeah, he's pretty good. And the way he moves, that's what makes him sexy, too. And he's so fucking cute and so handsome, too. Yeah, when he was naked, his cock is just perfect, though! I guess I just figured he would want to be with me and wanted to fuck me. When you gotta put that kind of stuff, it's sorta difficult to say no.</p> <p>Anyway, while we waited for a little time, we talked about old times and he told me about his first boyfriend, he'd gone out of town with a bunch of guys before he left his house. The good stories were all bullshit, but he always told me the girls at college were hot and the guys at the gym were pretty cool too. Then she had him on my bed, fucking like a wild woman. At first it was too much fun for me, not knowing how it was going to feel and then when we were both fucking, we would get all sweaty and then we'd lay together on the bed and he would take my virginity. We didn't do much else that night either. It was too weird and I just wanted him so much, I went to sleep with him on Monday morning. We had sex and came back Tuesday and Thursday though. It's kinda hard to tell the difference in who guys are. Anyway I guess you think you're a wild stud, right?</p> <p>I was pretty hot on Tuesday for him too, but I told myself I would just do it if he wanted it. I liked having him in me, it felt good to be a virgin and it was sorta my fault for having a bad relationship with my boyfriend, if I fucked him he might just get a taste into me. I told myself I should just let it go, it wouldn't change anything. It's not like I'm gay.</p> <p>In the shower the next morning, I felt a little better for myself after taking my time and washing my hair. Mr. Wemick was in the bathroom when I came out of it and I looked at him. He had the strangest grin on his face and then he looked at my face before he looked down at my cock, making small talk and then looking at my crotch.</p> <p>"I want to thank you," I said, "and you are such a wonderful cock sucker, my ex was such a nice guy, too!"</p> <p>He blushed and then laughed and shook his head, "I wish we were doing this today, I never would have gone the last ten miles to try it. I don't know how we'd go without some fun."</p> <p>We washed each other and he looked at my dick a little longer then kissed the tip. "You like that idea?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I whispered. "It's the best way for me now to be a real guy. I have to admit I'm pretty curious about getting fucked. I'm in my first year in college and I've never been with a guy before. I'm not sure I want to try this."</p> <p>"Sure," he said, "you go for it."</p> <p>I stood there naked in the bathroom and looked at his semi-hard cock, I mean this little thing isn't even half hard.</p> <p>"There's this one guy that I'm really attracted to," he said.</p> <p>"I want to get that too," I whispered.</p> <p>"Good, I just wanted to ask you if you're interested," he said.</p> <p>"Um, yeah, what about?" I asked.</p> <p>"That guy in the dark corner over there. It's pretty dark there."</p> <p>I walked over to the corner and looked the guy up and down, he seemed nice enough and I turned to look into the dark corner. "There he is," I told him.</p> <p>I couldn't just stare at him as I did it. He stared at me and made strange comments.</p> <p>There he was holding my dick in one hand and talking to me in the dark.</p> <p>There he was talking to me, whispering "you want this dick in your cunt" and then I was shaking and it was like a huge wave of sexual excitement went off in me and I saw my cock was in his hand and he kept talking to me. He kept whispering and then I was kissing his neck and I felt it, it in my hand and then he kissed him then it and it with his lips and then his cock and thenâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
