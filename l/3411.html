MONSIEUR,—I send you the</strong> gift of a gift, Royal Navy officer, to assist. “Thank you, King.” His eyes were wide open. “Now, Princess. We’ll just have to see what happens. First of all, I’ve got a message for you, Princess. You’ll see. We’ve got a great deal in common, I can tell.”</p> <p>“No, you have to read my message.” The Princess smiled. “It’s about a ship and my ship, and about time.” And then she leaned forward to kiss him, her eyes wide.</p> <p>And now that she had kissed him, he could feel his cock swelling and lengthening. His mind flashed through the ship’s memory and pictured all that’s happened to him that day. There’s no way it could all be true. His hands were busy fumbling around her ass. She was so wet to his touch. He could still feel her wetness. They had licked her. But she wasn’t his girlfriend. She was his wife. And he didn’t have a wife to love. Then she was on her hands and knees licking his asshole. And he was still hard and still erect.</p> <p>But not his wife.”</p> <p>“I know. I know. I mean, look what we’ve got. Your prick is so swollen I can’t even wrap my hand around it properly. That is the sort of thing you don’t just hold in your hand and make yourself come without touching it yourself.”</p> <p>“How is that possible? I can only give you enough control to cum all you want. Besides, by the time you’re eighteen you won’t be able to feel like a proper lady, even your fingers can’t make love.”</p> <p>“I’m not going to make love to you all at the same time! I can only make love.” He was really feeling her up.</p> <p>“Well, you wouldn’t like it. Because, like it or not, the Princess likes to see something nice and long-lasting inside her. And this time I’m giving it both of us.”</p> <p>He could feel his cock growing harder. He was looking up at her face, which looked almost comical with her long eyelashes and straight bangs and those lips.</p> <p>“All right.”</p> <p>He raised her body off of the table, then leaned her back with his hands. He knelt between her knees and pushed his hips forward. She lifted up her legs and parted them again, and the position was perfect. He was between her knees again, but his cock was pointing straight.</p> <p>“Look at this.”</p> <p>He grabbed his shaft and stroked it up and down her dripping slit, rubbing the head up and down, lubricated with the copious juices that had formed. Then he looked down, looked up, and saw the beautiful sight before him, his dick aimed straight at her cunt.</p> <p>“Princess,” he whispered. “You’re going to make me cum any second. Is that okay?”</p> <p>“No. No. I’m not ready for that.” She leaned her head back. “You’ve got me dripping wet. And you know how I can come almost at the drop of my heart. I love you, you know.”</p> <p>She could only whisper it over and over again. She leaned her head back and closed her eyes. And her whole body vibrated at the touch of his cock, in her pussy, on her hot pink lips. And he felt her whole body shake, quiver with tension. And then he felt his cock slide into her, in that way only men can. It wasn’t a dick. It was the long, thin tube that drove straight up up into her.”</p> <p>And then the fucking started.</p> <p>And his cock was hard and long and thick. And he knew there was no stopping. “Oh, God, I’m going to come. Oh, please fuck me, sir.”</p> <p>“No. No. I don’t want my baby girl coming just yet. I want to have my hands running up your back and down your ass. That’s enough. I’m in control here, my cock is in control.”</p> <p>’s eyes were locked on his and he was looking at her in her eyes could only. He was smiling, and they were looking at each other. and not the very. They just looking at him. And they could see the whole and then and each—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
