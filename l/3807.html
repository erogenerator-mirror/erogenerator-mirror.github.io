Her forces were entirely destroyed or captured, and no further resistance was to be</strong> found. The first two weeks of the first season was just the first of the major assignments that Zodanga, Kan's father and mother had taught her. That was all that was left for the second year.</p> <p>The year that Kan finished her schooling would never be entirely finished. Although she had been allowed to study abroad as long as she wanted, Zodanga had never once applied for entry into a foreign student's university. At first she had been confused by the fact that she would be going there instead of studying in the city's capital for her education. It seemed that Zodanga hadn't paid any mind to it in the first year, especially when she had a serious case of shyness about her first day. But with the help of the other Zodangas, she realized that there would come a point when she would be accepted into higher classes. It would not be easy as you knew very well that she was going to have to do all the studying there and the extra classes there. She would have to be more than just a 'normal' student. She wasn't going to be 'a normal young girl'. You had to put in work.</p> <p>Sitting on the same side of the sofa that she'd been sitting in, Zodanga felt the anxiety that had been building in her mind since the start of the semester. A million thoughts flashed through her mind. Could it be that she was destined to marry a famous man? Perhaps I'm just destined to be a young girl. Maybe it could simply be that I'm more like the most popular girl there is. Maybe I'm going to make love to a total stranger, maybe I'm just the man from somewhere with whom I am now. Maybe I just might be destined to be the woman I have been for the last few days. But she dismissed these thoughts and continued watching her television.</p> <p>She had no idea when the next year would take place. Maybe next year, she had to find a job. Maybe she's a natural born porn actress! Maybe she's a good friend from college. Maybe that's all it's for! But on the other hand – surely that's all she's ever been!</p> <p>Chapter 1 -- The End of the semester.</p> <p>The following day after the departure of the final exams Zodanga was very nervous. She went through her usual routine before her departure. Today was Wednesday; the day after her next class. She dressed in her school uniform. She had come back to the room after work; she wanted to go to class. She went to class but found that she was not looking at a monitor. There were several students already in the room. Her head was downcast, her eyes locked with the teacher.</p> <p>"Hi Professor. Are you ready to go home before midnight? Or are you ready, because it's already after midnight," she nervously asked.</p> <p>"Why, of course you know!" The teacher said, smiling at her. "We are all here to have a pleasant evening with a beautiful girl! And since you won't be at school until after midnight, we can have a little fun in your flat." He gave a sly smile.</p> <p>Zodanga's nervousness was in part due to being asked at one time, but in the other part of the reason, her nervousness was in part because her nervousness was in part due to being the teacher.</p> <p>But the teacher was not to be denied. He was not to be ignored and she could feel his eyes roaming her body. They were just too good for her, and he was not going to take it for granted. And his eyes lingered over her body more than a mere glimpse. Her nipples were stiff, her whole body was still quivering. He licked his lips and took her hand.</p> <p>"Come with me, Zodanga. You won't regret it at all." And he led her through the crowd.</p> <p>They reached her flat. The first class ended early. The students filed out. Her heart was still racing from the excitement that she had felt at meeting with Mr. Kan, but even more excitement still flooded her pussy. The only comfort was in Mr. Kan's presence. He seemed so different; it was like he was here, not only with her but with her family as well. She had no other choice but to trust him.</p> <p>"Zodanga, I'm sorry I was so fast today, but I have to return now to my office, if there is any time left until I have to return", he said.</p> <p>"Please, do not disappoint me." He gave her a small smile as he walked out of class.</p> <p>A few minutes later they walked into his office. He was already seated in his desk chair, his knees spread apart, and a look of content. The same. He was waiting with his hand and waiting hand. Zod waiting for her.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Zod—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
