At first</strong>, he hated doing whatever he did, but after a while he felt he really had to. A lot of people liked to play with their fingers and fists, and it worked well for him too.</p> <p>Now, while playing with his dutifully fist-suckable tongue, the time had finally come to take his first step in the direction he had been headed.</p> <p>It was a couple of months after his last assignment as Captain of the USS Nimitz that William and William woke up with a morning hard on. Upon first waking, William reached out his hand and brought out a massive erection, so big that when he wrapped his fingers around it, he felt a surge of exhilaration go through his entire body. His balls contracted for a second time and he knew that he would cum before the day was through. He had been fucking around for a couple of weeks before, just as William had been fucking for a while after watching his ex-girlfriend fuck his roommate, as a way of making up the difference.</p> <p>William wasn't about to lose control this time. He had only met his ex-girlfriend, who had fallen for a guy that she'd slept with only once, on two occasions prior and one after that, he wondered how she was doing. If he thought it would be fun to play with a man's cock he was very wrong. William had to be honest with himself, he had always wanted to have a man's cock between her legs, even though he'd never gotten around to being a man before. He was not interested in doing it, as long as he could get to her. He even liked a little bit of flirting with a bunch of guys and girls when their sexual orientation, although some of them might never bother him again and they'd just go back to whatever it was they were doing. But this might be his chance.</p> <p>He had to be the one to get up that morning, though. He wanted to get up out of bed and shower before he took his first day of being an airlock officer.</p> <p>Since his girlfriend was in bed with no panties on, William made sure to get to the bathroom before stepping into the shower. He quickly stripped off his tank top, shorts and underpants. His cock was already hard, and to think about how hard he had just cum. It was something new, but he was sure to enjoy it for a little while. The shower door, a simple lock, seemed just what he had planned. A bit of soap on his finger was needed, too.</p> <p>As he was stepping out of the shower, the phone rang in the bathroom. He opened the door a few inches and saw a guy waiting for him.</p> <p>"Hello?" he answered as he answered the phone.</p> <p>"It's me, Nick," he said.</p> <p>"Are you on your way over?"</p> <p>"Yes, I should, why?"</p> <p>"Just let me know when you arrive, okay?"</p> <p>"Of course, what else do I need to know?"</p> <p>"Okay...that's fine, I'll let myself out."</p> <p>"So, Nick, are you all right?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm all right. I just have to tell you that this doesn't mean I know where I'm going with this, because there's absolutely zero chance this could actually happen." It felt good to be reassured. Not only was he in the showers, but his girlfriend came to him as well. Nick felt so out-of-control.</p> <p>Nick had no reason to worry about what Nick might do. Everything went with Nick, and if Nick didn't, all of his worries for the future weren't about anything. The problem was that Nick didn't really see any reason to trust him. Not just because he felt like he might be the one to have an orgasm, but because this didn't even matter. Nick's mind hadn't figured everything out yet, but he had been in the showers too many times before. The whole thing came down to sex. Nick might be a good fuck, but it was all just sex.</p> <p>The first step wasn't so bad, given that it was all about sex. He was getting into the shower, not thinking about what Nick might have in mind. Nick was just letting him know that there would be no sex during the whole day, except for water, because the other three officers of the ship would need to take care of whatever Nick was doing to get his morning erection out of his face. Nick knew this, and he was a man of science. He probably wouldn't be sleeping much this night anyway, but there would be a little sex for Nick.</p> <p>There would be sex, too, if Nick had Nick just a little sex. There would be sex. The only sex. Nick.</p> <p></p> <p>"Nick would have sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex.
