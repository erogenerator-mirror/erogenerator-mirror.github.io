Madame de Saint-Méran</h4><p><strong>A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort. After the ladies had departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort</strong>'s house and her daughter were still in her private quarters, I took a deep breath and said 'Amen'.</p> <p>'What do you think of her?' I asked.</p> <p>'She's really lovely,' answered Gilly, 'but you could easily have been with her.'</p> <p>'Yes, yes,' I agreed, 'but I would have loved to see her naked.'</p> <p>"My gosh! You are so bold!"</p> <p>Gilly had not expected it to end like that, so soon, but now she was beginning to get the courage to take a bold course. "Come along," she said, "let's get started."</p> <p>We did so, sitting on her divan, with Gilly right behind me, as I held my glass of vodka. Gilly was more mature than I, and drank steadily all day long because she wanted to do that right. We drank together, together, until we'd both been finished with our drinks. Then it was time to get comfortable, she perched on the sofa, I climbed on the carpet behind her, and we were off to the buffet table. Once the food was served, we went to sit in a comfortable corner—one that we used once before, when both of us had a hangover. But this time we didn't start with drinks; she did, but after a few chit-chat sessions with her husband, her husband's father from before—she decided to get bolder—so the next time we sat down, she had the chair opposite me. In fact, I didn't even hear her getting up until she'd placed my glass on the floor, her chair to my right. I leaned her up against one of the armchairs and kissed her; the kiss quickly turned to tongues, with me fondling her breasts under her jacket.</p> <p>"Hey!" she complained.</p> <p>"We shouldn't do this," I countered, reaching for the buttons of her jacket, but she caught me before I could pull them. We stared at each other for a few seconds until she lifted my head from her boob. "How does this feel?" she asked. "The first time we touched."</p> <p>We looked at the others, who were already seated. I saw the first woman in attendance—it was Gilly. She made an effort at sitting next to me, and then, without so much as a glance at me, she sat down with me. After having already had a beer, she took my glass from my hand and took a sip, then she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek. Our mouths came together, our tongues mingling. It was so different than anything I'd experienced before; it was like entering a new, forbidden place. And she was so strong, so mature, so wonderful.</p> <p>Our kisses slowly morphed: tentative, gentle kisses, but the passion of our explorations grew stronger. And when our lips finally parted, Gilly was breathing heavily, her eyes closed.</p> <p>"You know—I shouldn't do this." she said, pulling back.</p> <p>"Are you kidding me? Here I am, with that woman who I love and who'd marry me, naked, drunk, and married, and me sitting next to her in her bedroom."</p> <p>"You wouldn't," she said.</p> <p>"No. Here, I'll get out of your way and back into your room, so we're alone." I moved my hand to her waistline, gently caressing a bit of fabric.</p> <p>"I'll...I'll...I'll...I'll...don't do this," she repeated, her lips trembling.</p> <p>But when I slid my hand down between her legs and onto her thigh, a shock of excitement was evident in her reaction. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'd love to touch you, too."</p> <p>And I didn't. It took courage to keep going where we would have ended up, a few minutes before we finally broke our kissing. Gilly's body was trembling and she was breathing heavily. She had her hands in her lap, touching herself.</p> <p>Gilly's hand was on the table, her head thrown back. "Touch my breasts, too," she said. "Use your fingers."</p> <p>"And make me cum before we start again."</p> <p>Gilly's voice was like honey, her words so hot. She reached under her jacket. "Can you help me, Gilly?"</p> <p>"Of course," she replied with a giggle.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>My hand found her breast. I slowly circled the nipple. "A bit her nipple, caressed it.</p> <p>"Breat. She shivered more. It was as I caressed harder. "Tried.</p> <p>.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>But not. She gasped. Her hand was hard and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
