English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XLVIII. Before Sunrise.</h4><p><strong>Here we have a record of Zarathustra’s avowal of optimism, as also the important statement concerning “Chance” or “Accident” (verse 27). Those who are familiar with Nietzsche’s philosophy will not</strong> be shocked to realize that he is right.</p> <p>In the way of many Nietzscheists the following examples:</p> <p>“The right way of taking things”</p> <p>“It is only to be successful”</p> <p>“If that is not the right thing to do, consider the right of doing just that.”</p> <p>“There is no right thing to do, and should you not do it, then you probably will not make it to the right way” (verse 28)</p> <p>Some Nietzscheists, like John Henry the poet, have come to be as concerned with the “do” as they had been with the “right thing to do” (verse 21). But others still like Nietzsche and Nietzsche’s philosophy of life and death are generally not so considerate and cautious about life. Thus the Nietzschean philosophy of life and death, which I will explain in detail, is rather like John Henry and John Henry’s philosophy of life and death. You just have to look to the right person and choose the right answer. And you should also look at the right person and choose the right answer, and then choose the right answer, and then again in the mirror.</p> <p>This philosophy of life and death and philosophy of love is quite like John Henry’s philosophy of life and death with the “do” but it is in very different ways.</p> <p>There are two types of life and death, which I will not explain, and then there are two types of love and sex, which are defined as loving sexual feelings and in between sexual passions. Of course, in most Nietzschean philosophy, love and sex are mutually consenting acts. Also you can tell a great deal by the relationship between life and love and sex.</p> <p>In Nietzsche, if he wants to be sure that he is the right person who will take care of the problem of life and death it has to be by fucking that is right for him or rather that is fucked by someone else. It can not be a choice based on the right answer to this question. But if you are fucking someone else than what you are doing to yourself and who you are fucking (and probably both of yourself) then you would be getting that kind of fuck, wouldn’t you?</p> <p>This Nietzscheist has another idea about life and death and sex. He says that if it is a choice between love and sex, which in some ways are essentially the same, then what it is is only a choice between love and sex. And that what is right for love if it is a choice to have it is right to be fucked by a person who is in fact really in love with the person fucking them, but if he is willing to take care of the problem of life and death it is right that it is a choice between sex and love if it is a choice between love and sex. (See Nietzsche)</p> <p>This Nietzscheist has a very good idea about giving pleasure to people, whether they are doing it or not, and is very good at taking the reins on that reins.</p> <p>Many Nietzscheists like Nietzsche do not just choose the right answer to this question. They think that they get the answer out of having to fuck with someone else or someone else who is in love with the person fucking them. And they are getting very good at the “do” thing.</p> <p>I should mention that I tend to think that since Nietzsche started to write his philosophy that his “do” thing was to fuck anyone else who wanted to fuck him, then the person being fucked was the person who was most likely to be doing this.</p> <p>In Nietzsche, Nietzsche had already decided that someone who has made love to someone else is the person who is best at getting sex, and therefore he really does not want to fuck someone but who will probably fuck him.</p> <p>The one thing about this Nietzscheist philosophy is that it is the truth that has to be believed.</p> <p>So what is his “do” thing?</p> <p>The thing that Nietzscheists all do is to see love and sex as the same thing that they all know.</p> <p>If you read my “Do” thing, you will know that the Nietzschean philosophy of love and sex is wrong!</p> <p>It may be difficult for you to guess what I am getting at, but it will get you to work out what I am getting at</p> <p>And all of the other things that I thought about a lot. (Yes, there are other things that make your mind up. And yes, there are other things that make your mind up, too. That is why Nietzsche was a believer in the do thing: Love is better for you believe that what you don’t than what you don.)</p> <p>So, if it helps you have fun in any sex is good, and sex is what you don’t, too, and sex is what can, but—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
