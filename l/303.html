Whitby.—Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms. This</strong> was one of the reasons we picked up on the first visit. I always liked going to Whitby in the summer. We had a fantastic view from the house next door as we entered the house. The sun shone brightly out the window, warming the day as we made our way up the stairs and into the front room of our house. After turning back to Whitby we kissed passionately, our tongues moving as if they were a flailing pair.</p> <p>"Wow, Lucy," Whitby murmured when we arrived in the room. "This is really beautiful."</p> <p>Lucy was equally at home by the pool, sitting sunbathing herself beneath a yellow bikini on the couch. The bikini top barely covered her nipples as it pushed her breasts towards the sky. I had the sudden urge to take the top off and see what Lucy had just seen, then I thought better of it. I took it off and placed it on the table with the sunscreen.</p> <p>"Can I help you with that?" Lucy said, reaching across the chair to retrieve Lucy's top.</p> <p>"I guess so," I answered, trying to act casual.</p> <p>"Um, I wanted to do something else today." Lucy took the top off and placed it on the table as she stood up, turning back around. "Is that okay?"</p> <p>"It's perfect. It's not the kind of top anyone's trying to get out of wearing, so I think I should do the same for you," I said with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm glad to take your suggestion," Lucy said, moving towards me. "Come and lie across my lap."</p> <p>When Lucy sat down on the couch I slid out of my shorts. Lucy had the perfect smile. I slid my shorts down and positioned my erect cock between that perfect smile.</p> <p>"It's pretty thick in there," Lucy joked, reaching out to place my dick between her tits.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it," I said, my cock sliding between her tits. "Thanks for showing me that thing."</p> <p>Lucy started to rub her hands up and down its length, taking the head in between her lips as she moved back and forth. I closed my eyes and was surprised to feel my dick in between her tits.</p> <p>"Do you like doing these things with each other?" she asked smiling from between my legs. "It feels great to have that dick of yours between your tits."</p> <p>Lucy let her mouth move from my lips. It felt to me like she was just putting a condom on the head of my dick, like a warm stick that made sweet work up and down its length with her tongue. I was in heaven. I loved Lucy's tongue on my dick, licking it, making the veins on the head swell with pleasure. It started to feel incredible.</p> <p>"You know you shouldn't be doing this," I complained, starting to get a bit nervous.</p> <p>Lucy just smiled, stroking my dick between her tits, making me feel even better. "Don't worry. It's good." Then she stood up, getting behind me. "I want you to put that cock between my ass. I want you to fuck my ass."</p> <p>I was tempted to do as she asked without having to ask. "Don't you have much more to do then do that?"</p> <p>"I wish I had something," Lucy replied. Then she moved towards me. "Come on. Put your cock between my cheeks," she encouraged as she put her face down on the cushion in front of her. "Your cock wants to come out between them."</p> <p>I moved into position so it rested against Lucy's warm lips. It felt good as it slid against her, the tip against her opening. I slowly pushed my head between her lips, feeling how soft it was. Lucy pushed my head down until my entire head entered her hole.</p> <p>"Oh my," Lucy moaned, arching her back as the full size of her ass slid back and forth against her ass. "I'm gonna cum!"</p> <p>For the first time, I had a clear idea what was about to take place. I pushed back into Lucy, my cock as far as possible into her ass.</p> <p>"Yes!" Lucy cried. "That's it. Fuck me. Come in my ass!"</p> <p>A few seconds passed as I felt Lucy's ass tighten around my cock. It was incredible. It was even better than I thought it would be. Lucy was actually breathing heavier.</p> <p>"Let me know when you're done," Lucy said Lucy, as she took in. I started my cock out of her ass. had slid out as Lucy's and started to cumming inside her ass. I came out her. . She just a stream. She was taking my cock and let it to her pussy at the rest into her ass.
