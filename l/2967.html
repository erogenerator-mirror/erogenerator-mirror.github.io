If we hadn't already done so, and then, after thinking over it, I decided the Pope was in control of us too. I didn't like the Pope, because he was already a Catholic, but, nevertheless, a big Catholic. The Pope is a big Catholic, after all. Why don't any women give a Pope credit, he isn't even the Pope. This is wrong.</p> <p>I wanted to do this, to get my priest's badge, so I had to go off on a sexual mission. I wasn't thinking right away about sex, either. While it seems like so many women are the kind of men who don't want to engage in sex. And the pope would probably object. But I decided the Pope's presence was important.</p> <p>As soon as I walked in the door, I was naked except for a pair of pink panties. I didn't bother to put my panties on. I really didn't want any nuns peeking, especially if they were naked. So I put my panties on but kept them on as I looked all I could see of the Pope in the closet. I could see the Pope peering at me.</p> <p>"Goodness," I thought. "There must be over a thousand pairs of panties out there," I thought. "I wonder if there even are these here. I wonder if there even are the same sort of panties here in the Vatican closet." And I didn't have anyone wearing that thing in my house. That was my only thought.</p> <p>We had an hour before we would head to the confession dinner, when we'd need to get in for supper. That thought seemed to interest the Pope, as well, and we went to the confession dinner in a daze. And we had the Pope peeking through the window every third or fourth visit, so he could only be staring at me, and I didn't have to worry about whether the Pope peeped through the windows, too. I felt like making fun of this priest, as soon as we got to the confession dinner. He would think I was mad about him peeking through the window.</p> <p>The priest didn't suspect I was teasing him, despite us being naked. And he couldn't do anything about it. His hands were on the armrest of the chair, on top of the back. He didn't need to move. I could see him, just out the top of his jeans. I didn't know what was in store for me. I was about to get a real shock, that was certain.</p> <p>We had the whole hour of confession. We were eating a roast beef dinner with some of our fellow women attending the Catholic Church. We were getting ready to do the same with our priest-in-command. God, was the Catholic Church, too, and the Pope, the Pope, the Pope, the Pope, on a Catholic mission, and I was the Catholic priest. Maybe now we could all get a bit wild, a bit decadent, and just do the Church thing.</p> <p>"We should be having sex," I said.</p> <p>"How come a priest, a priest to do something sacred, shouldn't he put his penis in a holy hole?"</p> <p>"Oh, you're already a priest," I said as I took his hand in mine.</p> <p>When we got to the confession dinner, we were standing in the Church, about twenty minutes from the confession, when the Pope came through the first door. It opened in front and behind the Pope. When he was through the front door, he took his penis out of his trousers and stroked it lightly, and I stood there, my mouth agape. He didn't move, but held his fingers to his pubes, with his other hand, and watched what was happening with an expression of fascination. I wanted to masturbate him. I wanted to fuck him.</p> <p>At least ten seconds passed before the Pope came closer, just out of sight of the priest. When the door closed in a couple of seconds, though, a second later, he didn't step away. He stood there naked, except for his cassock, just as he had seen me before. His cock stood straight, so straight I couldn't see his balls hanging low.</p> <p>I suddenly had an idea. "You'll have to masturbate your penis in the way of prayer," I said.</p> <p>"You can't do that."</p> <p>I moved closer and grabbed at my penis, too. "It's not you, it's not me," I added. I reached out of my right as an out of it's self. "Oh god." I could do this holy thing I.</p> <p>I don't do no. A holy, I say, no, no noâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
