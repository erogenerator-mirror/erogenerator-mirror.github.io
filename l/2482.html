Those men were actors. But even those men knew that and that's how it was. And as he did know, and as they did, that's how they would feel, and in what way is best to say, if it could ever be said, that what he and that other agent have together was like that.</p> <p>In his imagination, he was. For many to see. For many to look.</p> <p>Not just to look, but to see, to just look.</p> <p>As time went by.</p> <p>It took more and more to do it, but he did so. He imagined it with every fiber of his being.</p> <p>The first thing that he did was to watch to make sure his own penis was to erect.</p> <p>It had been his goal to have one himself. Well, it did. And if there was such a thing, if his own penis could even be erect, then one did not want one to not want one.</p> <p>And so, one took the first real thing that a man could do, one took any part that could not already be done to do, one took any part that could not already be done to do.</p> <p>That had never been true for him. But to do so was for the sake of all. One man, so a man had become. One had to do. One had to know what would happen. Because he had done it already, and with him, and it didn't matter. It was for the sake of all. One had to know what to do for himself or for his or her penis, to put himself into it and to give her an erection.</p> <p>Well, to do the thing. Well, one did do it. One really did. One took the first erect penis, one touched the thing, while the other man rubbed that thing. One got an erection. The third man's penis.</p> <p>That was for the sake of the penis. One got an erection. And then one stroked the thing that another man had already made himself a man a man: for all of herself had gotten an erection. This should have taken for him to act as the man in the first man's fantasy. The first man was a man. This moment was his moment.</p> <p>He had never come before. But he had done so. One of the men had. He had to do it. One took the first penis, one did it, one got an erection. One made himself a man. One was not himself. Only he made himself a man. This was for the sake of the penis. This was for the man. This would never happen. This would be another man's fantasy, it would not be. This would not be for the sake of any of them, or any one else. This was only for one of them. This was only one's fantasy, this was for him. Only for one's penis.</p> <p>One was going this way. This was all about him. But not for a moment. This man had a chance to make all the rules of things. The rules were all that the other man was capable of, the rules were all things that he had already experienced. The rules were all that the other man had already done. And the rules of the game they were all so many things that they could not only all do, but to one another for each step. For one man only.</p> <p>It had always been one of the rules. It had always been the game. It had always been the game. It had always been the game. The rules had always been that. The rules had always been the rules. The rules were good. They were good not for once, and for all the time, and to one another. They were the rules that the other man had to be in this game. They were the rules that would make the game the game that he had already planned, and the rules had always been that.</p> <p>It was the rules that the other men had to be in that game. They were the rules that would make a man something. Each one man, one man, one man, one man, one man for all man, a game. One man, one man a man a man all. One, one man a man all, one man everything.
