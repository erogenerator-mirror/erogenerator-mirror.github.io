The Decanter.</h4><p><strong>Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant of that city, the</strong> most famous book inventor of England in its lifetime.</p> <p>The only words that can describe her face in this story are to be a perfect lady of the ocean, a woman who's seen things that she never thought she'd have seen, and the way her family dresses and undresses as her life as a young woman unfolds as a beautiful, mature woman with a happy future ahead of her. And to think that her life might be boring, boring again, now that she has such a happy memory, is to think that a woman with such a wonderful life could be happy again in the twenty-first century.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>William was in bed with a woman.</p> <p>William was the sole recipient of the woman's sexual favors. The woman was a stranger, an alien, a forbidden, immoral creature, and would be returned to Earth. Only a few people had been involved in any of this as far as William knew, nor would William recall that their names had actually slipped from the names from the book.</p> <p>But here she was, in bed with him, kissing him. And she was a beautiful woman, and he couldn't get enough of her.</p> <p>Her skin was soft and warm. Her mouth tasted faintly of the peppermint gum she had eaten, her nipples were small and pink, and her thighs were parted.</p> <p>William groaned at the sight of a woman's sex, the way it spread over his stomach and his cock swelled to full-rigidity at the sight of it. What would it be like to be with these things? It looked so much like the things that they were. They were beautiful, soft, warm, and inviting. William reached up and grasped her hip. Then, when his fingers stroked in the tight crevice between her cheeks, he slid a finger between her wet folds and into the slick warmth.</p> <p>William was entranced by her scent, the soft-flawless body underneath him, and the taste that she teased him with as he fucked her with his finger.</p> <p>William stroked his finger along the length of her folds, to caress her as he kissed her. Then, when she opened her legs and raised it to his hand, he slid his hand under her and into her wetness.</p> <p>"Oh," he hissed as he slid a finger into her.</p> <p>The scent of her sex, the taste of her, was all William remembered in his head. The scent of her pussy was the essence of this human being, of this plant, this animal being. He had never known such a thing, to have anything like this in all his years of hunting and eating the wild animals. Of course, many of them were wild animals and some weren't; it might have been a more human way of being.</p> <p>William pushed his finger in and out of her, watching her hips roll under him as he began to finger her, stroking her in ways that made her knees weak. It was her pussy, this alien body of hers, this mysterious creature inside, that brought him that pleasure he had never known.</p> <p>William began to move his finger inside her slowly, sliding his finger in and out of her as he licked her clit. He could feel the soft hair around her opening wet and slippery, feeling the heat, the moisture, of her, that she drew out of the body that had known him and this otherworldly, animal being for days. It was a beautiful thing, and something that was hard to describe.</p> <p>"I'm so close," William cried as he stroked inside her and licked her clit.</p> <p>The woman moaned. For a brief moment, he sensed what she wanted. She had a soft body, and he wanted her body. He wanted to make this creature come.</p> <p>William moved his head down and began to kiss her. He kissed her as he stroked his finger in her. Feeling her respond was more than he could resist; he wanted her to come for him.</p> <p>William slid his kisses down her neck, making his way down to her breasts. He didn't kiss them, he didn't suck on them, he didn't kiss them. He kissed her breast, felt them, enjoyed the soft texture of their skin. She felt like she was melting in his hands as he kissed them.</p> <p>She writhed on the bed, her legs falling open and his finger still in her. He took her nipple between his lips and gently bit it, enjoying the moans that escaped along with her cries. William was aroused; he could feel the hardness of his cock through his pants as he held his finger in her. He wanted her more than he wanted any other human being.</p> <p>William wanted more than he wanted any human being in his heart William.</p> <p>William.</p> <p>William William could. William. All William</p> <p>William was William William wanted William.
