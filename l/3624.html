FRESH SUSPICIONS</h4><p><strong>There was a moment’s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least surprised of any of us, was the first to speak. “My word,” he cried, “you’re the goods! And no</strong>, we shouldn’t!”.</p> <p>I was about to protest him and ask, “Why are you trying to push me on this, if it isn’t the best time we had?”, when suddenly the lightbulb went off as we both looked at each other.</p> <p>Neither of us said anything that might have revealed what awaited us inside. We took our time, letting the moment pass. We made eye contacts with each other, and then looked down. Our breasts were pressing together. We stood there for what felt like a minute or two. The heat was off in the hallway and the shadows were growing dim. I could read his mind quite plainly that he wanted me. I smiled sweetly and squeezed his hand. We were lost in our own internal debate.</p> <p>We broke off the moment just as it began. I put my hand on top of his and took his face in my hands. Our lips and tongues began to dance again. His arms were around my waist with my hands resting lightly on the small of his back. We kissed for what seemed forever.</p> <p>When our lips came apart, we both gazed in amazement at one another. I thought to myself, “This has to be our last kiss…or ours…because we could never go,” and I squeezed his hand once again. He smiled at me and kissed me again. It’s an affectionate thing, a good thing; it’s so special, but also so dangerous, and yet so good.</p> <p>Finally, it was time to go. I gave him a quick kiss on the lips, and then told him to meet me in my room once he had had his morning shower. He nodded and followed me to my bedroom. He had no way to see that we were doing it and yet he did have to know we were planning to fuck.</p> <p>We began to strip off our clothes and he began to caress my breasts. “Honey,” I whispered, “no, we shouldn’t…” But, I felt myself getting hotter and hotter as he did exactly that – and he loved it. I ran my hands down his body as if to assure myself we wouldn’t do it without some kind of ceremony. He took my hands and slid them under the waistband of my panties. I raised my hips into his hand. His fingers slid them between my pussy lips and he began to stroke my clit. He fingered me in earnest. He slid his finger in and out several times before sliding it into my hole. “Oh, my gosh!” I whispered, but I made no sounds of pleasure for the whole time. I could feel the fire begin to grow within me – he was in control as much as me and it took all my effort not to rip off his clothes and plunge his cock deep into me.</p> <p>Finally, he pulled his hand out of my panties and stood up. He kissed me and held me so close to him that I thought we would fall apart. His kiss was long and passionate, and his hands were on my face, my neck, and my breasts. “Let me in,” he whispered, to which I nodded. He took my hand and put it on him. He ran his hand down my arm and between us. I held his erection, like my life depended on it, and he felt the heat of my hand through my clothes.</p> <p>Slowly, he began to slide them toward my body. I could tell when it had finally reached its limit, that it was going to be an inch or so, but when he began to lift me out of my panties, he looked down at me and grinned. “I’m ready,” he said. I smiled too – I couldn’t believe what a man I was, but then I realized what a man I had become.</p> <p>With both of us naked, we dropped down to the bed together. I put my arm around him and gave him a kiss on the lips. Then we were kissing again, with the same passion. My tongue found his and we moved on to a new position. I took off his shoes and socks, then got rid of his pants. When I was naked, he slid down the bed and spread my legs. He lay down with his head next to mine and licked and tasted me. When I was ready, I spread my thighs. He took my lips in his mouth and sucked. I started to come on his face. He put his mouth over my cunt and tasted my juices. He tasted with his tongue and his face and I came on my pussy – his face, and licked on my, and sucked and let their mouths and fingers – and had. Everything. He fucked me – and he had my face, licked and fucked and sucked my and sucked and sucked—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
