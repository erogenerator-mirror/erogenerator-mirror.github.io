English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXXIX. The Drunken Song.</h4><p><strong>It were the height of presumption to attempt to fix any particular interpretation of my own to the words of this song. With what has gone before, the reader, while</strong> being conscious of any misunderstanding of the intent of the song, it can be noted that it contains an immoral act of sexual intercourse against the will of the subject. It is, therefore, the understanding that only encouraged by its writer, the author's agent, should include one or more, and/or vote, the lyrics of this song to the lyrics of this song, which is also a song about sex between consenting adults with a particular form.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Hey, Dad I was wondering if you guys would like to hang out," Sarah said with a mischievous grin, "I'm going to go get my things for the rest of the night and then go into my room."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, you're not coming out?"</p> <p>"Yeah, why not?"</p> <p>Sarah was right behind me, not caring that I had only just left her to get dressed. "You guys stay home," she advised, "I'll cook up lasagna and you can hang out."</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Dad!"</p> <p>My daughter and I had finally settled down after my last visit to the college where I'd been taking classes there, having settled onto the sofa in front of an empty television, waiting for the news that would come onto the news at eight o'clock. As I started to get up, my daughter stood up.</p> <p>"Dad, are you okay," she asked.</p> <p>I stared at her for a moment, then realized she was completely naked too, and I was still covered by a blanket.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry," I said, putting down the TV and then lying back down on the sofa, "I hope we can still work on that," I said apologetically.</p> <p>Sarah sat down next to me, placing one arm around me while reaching one hand behind me, feeling me up as I lay on the sofa, and with her other hand pulled down my boxer shorts revealing my cock.</p> <p>"Oh daddy, it's so big," she exclaimed with delight and with both hands wrapped around my shaft, "how long do you think it will fit in your sister's pussy?"</p> <p>As if she was asking me if I was okay with her being seen with other people, now she was asking me if she could have sex with my sister. Of course I wasn't sure she was asking me if she was a lesbian, but in most cases, that question was just idle speculation. I'd have to ask Rachel later.</p> <p>"Are you sure your sister will be okay with you fucking me?" I asked her.</p> <p>We both laughed at our joke. She pulled at my cock in the air and then began stroking me in a way that I'd never felt in my life, giving a slow methodical stroking that made me harder than I had ever been before.</p> <p>"Dad, can we fuck like this again?" her voice asked.</p> <p>"Fuck yeah," I replied, "I want to, like, make love again."</p> <p>*</p> <p>When I came back into the living room later, I was shocked to see that Rachel was already on the sofa asleep in her underwear lying on her back. She was already naked as usual so, she didn't even bother to try to cover her naked body apart from the blanket before rolling over towards me, then leaning over to kiss me.</p> <p>"Oh God, this is so beautiful, I just love the way your sister is looking at you," she said, "I hope she's making love to you, too!"</p> <p>She was lying on her back, now.</p> <p>"Do you like my night shirt?" Sarah asked as she sat up and pulled off her blanket and pulled the night shirt over her head, then she pulled up on the bottom of her nightshirt to start feeling up my bare chest with her hands.</p> <p>Sarah pulled the blanket away, revealing my sister's naked body to both our eyes, one on her and one off, then my sister moved her fingers inside her panties to find her clit, which she started to rub while kissing me.</p> <p>Once she found her clit, Sarah gave out a little scream but didn't wake me up. While we enjoyed making out, I had decided to move off the sofa, so I fell on Rachel's chest and pulled her t-shirt off. She helped me strip and then, like the night before, she pulled down the blanket so that our two bodies were on show.</p> <p>Even though Sarah is shorter than me, Sarah's breasts are a little bigger than mine, but not by much. Rachel's, the smaller, kind of sag in her breasts compared to Sarah's round and curvy breasts, though. Rachel's weren't as big as my sister's, but still a solid C was just a big, and I guessed, but more than a real big, and big, but natural, they just a natural and natural I'd be fair.
