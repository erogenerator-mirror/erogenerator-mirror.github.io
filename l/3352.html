A Retrospection</h4><p><strong>It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker Street.</strong></p> <p>"There are no words to describe what I feel, or what I am feeling, Mr. Holmes."</p> <p>I'm glad for him, for being here beside me.</p> <p>"I don't know about you but if you're going to stay here for the rest of your lives, I am glad to be with you all my life."</p> <p>With an ironic smile, he leans over and kisses me, as he usually does.</p> <p>And he still hasn't spoken to me because at least we didn't meet before, at least not on a first date.</p> <p>"Of course," he said after he gives me another playful French kiss.</p> <p>Maybe I should have met her first.</p> <p>"Thank you," I say, and hug him.</p> <p>"You're welcome."</p> <p>"Let's get back on your knees before we get caught up and run out to your car," he says, and leads me out to the car.</p> <p>He helps get both of us back on our knees before we even get in. And while we're kissing and cuddling up to each other, he's fingering me for a bit before he shoves his fingers in my pussy and starts teasing my tits, making my nipples get hard and erect. It feels so good.</p> <p>"Your pussy smells like sex," he says with a sexy smile.</p> <p>"Maybe we are both," I say, as he starts eating me.</p> <p>I'm still so wet and horny.</p> <p>"Maybe we are both," he says as he shoves one of his fingers in my pussy, then slides the rest of his finger into my mouth and starts fucking me with his finger.</p> <p>"Or maybe we are both," I say, and rub my hands all over his cock and balls.</p> <p>"Maybe we are both," he says, and then says something that really has me going crazy. "I've been thinking about fucking you for this whole month."</p> <p>As we're fucking ourselves, it's like all of my sexual fantasies come true. I always enjoy sex the way I love fucking, in any bed I ever stop in, and that was exactly what I had for him.</p> <p>"I've been fucking for so fucking long," he say after he tells me all kinds of kinky stuff.</p> <p>He's got no idea how to fuck a woman. He never makes me come so hard.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about fucking you for two months," he says and looks right into my eyes.</p> <p>"I want to be fucked by you," I say, and start to smile while fingering my pussy for him.</p> <p>"I want to be fucked by you, Mrs. C.," he says, and leans his face closer to mine.</p> <p>"Make love to me," I say, as a big smile spreads over my face.</p> <p>There is no problem as we kiss and hold each other tightly. It's all right, as I know there doesn't have to be a problem. For all the reasons I told you before, it doesn't change the fact that we're both married. Besides, there's no need to worry about being caught out in the open while we're fucking.</p> <p>"I love you," he says after we pull apart.</p> <p>"I love you, too," I say.</p> <p>But I feel his hand on my thigh.</p> <p>"I want to make love with you," he says to me.</p> <p>"Make love to me, too."</p> <p>"We're getting married again."</p> <p>"We are, but we're not, but we are getting married again."</p> <p>"Yes, we're," I say. As we kiss once again, we're kissing again.</p> <p>I start feeling guilty and guilty again when he makes out with me, especially since we're already in bed.</p> <p>"I love feeling guilty," he says. "I love feeling guilty about wanting to take you," he says, as he continues kissing me.</p> <p>"Yes, we're both married," I say.</p> <p>We're not doing anything else until we're finished with our showering. Then we're going on our way, getting dressed for the wedding and coming to some kind of celebration afterwards.</p> <p>"We're going to drive us to the airport after being married a year," I say.</p> <p>"I love making you feel guilty."</p> <p>"I do that too, Mr. Holmesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
