When the Bulgarians retired, my dear</strong>, you shall go away..."</p> <p>Mauritamu was shocked at all this and even more shocked at the real events which had happened in the past few hours. She could feel herself getting wet, she could feel her pussy becoming wet despite her protestations to be rid from the bed and to go to the bathroom. She remembered how much pleasure it had given her that day when her daughter had called to her and confessed to being a lesbian. They had had great fun and had even shared a special moment in the night.</p> <p>But then the evening in which she had shared her daughter's sexuality with a different person, she had remembered that there might have indeed been a difference. It would have been a different story if someone had tried to change her into it... But there it was, just as there was with her. Perhaps it had happened only yesterday. The evening had passed in more ways than one. It was like someone had transformed her into a vampire.</p> <p>Mauritamu realized for the first time in her life that this was a true memory. She looked back at the screen and saw her eyes had changed, a little. She didn't mean to. She had changed into a man. Perhaps they had all changed back to the male version of herself. But they had changed back again at the same time. Now it was her daughter who had made the change.</p> <p>Mauritamu had changed back. She had changed back into her female form, while she had never wanted to change it to some stranger, or even someone of the same sex again. Now that it had come back to her as an erotic fantasy, this dreamy memory had made her want to be a man.</p> <p>She remembered feeling the urge to have sex once again after such a wonderful day with her daughter.</p> <p>Mauritamu had wanted to experience this again.</p> <p>Mauritamu went back to her home to change her clothes and sleep and to think and find what was happening.</p> <p>Mauritamu found some books on sexuality and psychology and studied them some day. She found her eyes reflecting her confusion and was puzzled at what she read. In the pages she was amazed, she had never read a book on sexuality. It was like reading the old English books she had never seen or read.</p> <p>She thought about getting out of there but couldn't get comfortable. She went on to write a poem on her daughter's sexuality, and the poetry seemed to help her feel better. She felt happier and more confident as a woman and she found herself looking at the words when she wrote them.</p> <p>She started to feel a new kind of pleasure and a deeper feeling of trust. Was it because she was feeling happier and stronger by being able to be who she had been? Or was it because she had found something she thought she desperately wanted and was happy?</p> <p>This feeling was not unpleasant and it aroused her. It brought her back to the first moments when she had seen her daughter at the hospital. The sight and the feeling of her daughter's lovely eyes were enough to take her breath away. She had to kiss them, something she had never done before. Her lips moved towards those beautiful mouth of hers and she found that her tongue began to dance with the first of the mouths which had ever touched her breasts...</p> <p>She remembered the feeling of someone else touching her before. That special feeling between those luscious lips. But this time, it was different. It was a different kind of feeling. It was the most feeling her body had ever felt in her life... It was exciting! It was exhilarating!</p> <p>She got bolder!</p> <p>"Don't tell me," she laughed. "If you have all the time in the world, make yourself at home. I'll find something to read."</p> <p>She had always looked at her daughter as another mother, but now she had had an opportunity to be an artist. If she could come here with what she was feeling for her daughter, she could do what she enjoyed but she couldn't be a teacher. Her daughter was an adult now.</p> <p>It was time to see the beauty which had been burned out in her heart, in her head by so very intense and heart-rending event.</p> <p>Mauritamu's heart beat faster as if a bomb had been ignited in her head. She couldn't read a thing so she found her heart rate increasing. She didn't want her heart to stop beating so she had to reach up and hug herself.</p> <p>There was a time when her heart wasn't as strong as it had been. After this she had found herself alone in a room with no one person there at all the time, not being the year. She realized that she was at least in her self-self in her father was there without some sort of a man of a woman.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>A man.
