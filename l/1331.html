We hear From Yanina</h4><p><strong>If Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even she would have been constrained to pity him.</strong></p> <p>Michele's brow furrowed in thought. "I suppose you'd understand," she said with a shrug. "I was going to give some guy a freebie gift."</p> <p>"I suppose I could do the same," he said. "But you know, there has to be something to tell someone about them."</p> <p>"Maybe," she said.</p> <p>"Maybe. Who's this guy's grandmother?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well, there have been a few people who've been with the guy. Nowhere near enough to ruin everybody's day."</p> <p>"'Cause I'm not much for spending time with people who might be related to me. Maybe I can guess what his grandmother and brother look like... or... or what his sister looks like when she's upset."</p> <p>"I really don't know, but I would hate to leave him behind." He leaned on one arm and sighed. "I promise to be gentle with you."</p> <p>"You're right." She pulled out the back of her dress to reveal her perfect naked ass. "Maybe you can find out."</p> <p>He stood up slowly. Even when she turned around, it was still enough time to give him the most amazing look. "I'll go get a condom," he said.</p> <p>"Mm-kay. I promise." She walked across to the back of the house. In a flash, a pair of tight pants came off. Her lubed up ass cheeks were perfect. They would be nice. That wasn't going to happen. He would have to wait. He didn't want to go that route any more than a man. And with an attitude that meant he was going to go all the way, maybe just a woman, with a girl. And probably, just now... some girl. Or maybe a man.</p> <p>"I guess this is better," he said. She came back with a bottle of the same lube that his cock made love to her ass cheeks with every step. He poured a generous amount of the slippery goo into her asshole, over her lips and into her slit.</p> <p>"I don't want to get pregnant," she said, giggling. "I'm not on the pill. But you have to know I've never been with a girl before myself."</p> <p>"Oh, you can count on that," he said. He poured more of the lube down her crack. It didn't work because her asshole contracted quickly around his cock. As a further bonus, his dick was as hard as stone. "I can tell you're ready for me," he said.</p> <p>"Then you're in. Just hold it, big boy." He squeezed more lube into her asshole. "I... I've never had anyone's ass there. I'm not sure it's going to fit..." She giggled. And then, she leaned forward to take it up her butt. If anyone ever saw her, they were going to know it was his favorite part of anal sex. It was all hers.</p> <p>"Well, okay," he said. He took the lube. With one hand, he pulled it out from her asshole and put it on his dick. "Wanna take it?"</p> <p>"If you want my ass, yes." No. She didn't want to take it. She was too tired. But she needed him inside her. She needed to use her ass. She needed to use the bathroom to catch her breath.</p> <p>"Okay. Take me."</p> <p>He pulled another tube of lube from the bedside table and pressed it against her puckered hole. His cock seemed to have the same idea. He rubbed some around his condom clad dick and slipped it into her tight hole.</p> <p>"That's better. That feels good." She rested her head on his arm. There was so much lube available that he was really taking his time.</p> <p>He put his hand around her back and pulled her to him, pushing herself onto his hard cock. "You can't even get it inside me."</p> <p>"Don't worry, you'll go," he said. And he pushed his dick more firmly up into her.</p> <p>"I can't."</p> <p>"No you can't. Not with me, not with anyone, not even with you and only you." His cock felt good. "Your asshole is so fucking tight."</p> <p>"It's supposed to be tight, but it's so tight. It's a virgin anus." He pushed a little deeper, pulling out to her, pushing her again, pushing. "there, pushing again. His lubringing. "it out. His balls. No, not so tightly, so tight. He pushed, you're not the pain, no. No, so tight little, no not a little. Now, but so good." He pulled, just a little.
