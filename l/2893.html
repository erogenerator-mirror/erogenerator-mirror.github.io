To be saved, is to be secured, either respectively, against speciall Evills,</strong> or, as many Christians as can safely count, against the laws of Man. It is, after all, a Christian belief.</p> <p>"Oh God . . ."</p> <p>"Oh fuck!"</p> <p>"Oh God!"</p> <p>"That's it, baby, fuck them!"</p> <p>"Harder."</p> <p>"Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh God!"</p> <p>"Oh God!"</p> <p>"That's it . . ."</p> <p>"Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!"</p> <p>As she was feeling it build up, getting closer to what she knew was a fabulous big load, she looked down to see the first rope of spunk shoot up in the air high into the air. It was only the head of it, and there was no way it could have been bigger than when she was sucking it off John in the movie "Big Boy."</p> <p>"I'm ready, now, baby!"</p> <p>That's all John wanted. His mouth and fingers, his tongue, and his cock, and his mouth were all ready for it. His fingers fucked Sarah's cunt and his ass while she licked him. She was still on her knees on the kitchen floor, legs wide open, with her arms behind her, while her cunt was still full, and she was watching his eyes. This wasn't John's first time doing this. He was probably going to do it plenty more before he had to leave and go back to work. For now, though, he was going to enjoy watching her come like that.</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>She could see it in his face, and she could feel it in his voice when he said it. This was a good sign. John definitely knew how to control himself when, with any woman he made love to, he needed to get things out of her mouth, his hands, and his tongue. If he was successful, and it seemed like he was, Sarah knew she had done a good job at pleasing herself. It was her turn now to be on the bottom.</p> <p>His cock began to grow when she felt it reach the opening of her pussy, and she leaned back against it, feeling the ridge on it slide up into the tight opening and against her clit. John didn't bother waiting for her to relax her muscles, because he kept them there, keeping her there, feeling his cock enter her. It was the first time he had entered her and he was afraid she would not have enough experience before the invasion. Sarah just focused on the feeling of him sliding in and out of her. In fact, she never thought that he would ever actually be able to do something like that.</p> <p>As much as she wanted to hold it inside her, there was still room in the way because her pussy was stretched by John's cock, and she didn't want him to know that he was about to pull out and slide back into her. She thought if she was going to make a complete fool of herself and leave him there for a while, he didn't have to be on top again, so she held on. "You got it all in, big boy, and it feels good. That's it, give it to me. Give me all you've got."</p> <p>John didn't know when he started to move, so he just kept a firm hold on her hips and began to move. As he had promised, he continued to look down, focusing more on having a nice long cock slide back into her and getting the full length of his cock in her.</p> <p>Sarah didn't know what she did when she'd started getting her tits out on a weekday morning, for he was right in front of her. She reached down and put her fingers on each side of her tits, feeling the soft flesh, the hard nipples, feeling the heat of her skin against him, and remembering the wonderful way that John would pinch them, then let them go so he could play with them later.</p> <p>As she had learned, Sarah couldn't imagine a better place to be getting her second orgasm than right before she had her body being stretched, having the pleasure of John's cock in her and having something as delightful as a lover's tongue working on her clitoris, the one he had been playing with the other day, and making them a tingle all day long. Right now if he'd just moved back so fast that they hadn't known it, a second orgasm for Sarah would be the best of all times. John wasn't going to stop there though. Instead of going with the rocking motions of a lover's hips, he was going to be able to keep going for a few minutes, and when he was done, he was going to fuck her as hard as he could while he did. He was able.</p> <p></p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p>Sarah wanted</p> <p>Sarah Sarah wanted Sarah Sarah wanted</p> <p>Sarah Sarah Sarah, which</p> <p>Sarah Sarah wanted Sarah Sarah Sarah That whichâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
