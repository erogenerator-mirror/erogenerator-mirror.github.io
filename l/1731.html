As my cousin, I used to listen to their movies and when watching them I used to listen to that. Today, I'm an actor, a teacher, and a teacher in a school full of students who think of themselves as people and not movie. We don't talk about this stuff in the school halls. We do it in the library. And that's what we do. We make movies.</p> <p>We're the movie star in their family of friends. We're the movie stars, the teachers and the kids for that matter. And we fuck and we fuck and fuck and fuck and fuck and fuck. We're the stars.</p> <p>And we're the stars because we have money. We fuck and we fuck with passion and, even better, we fuck for money.</p> <p>We're the star stars because we have the money. We live in a money-grubbing bubble town, where only the rich and the famous fuck all they want, all they have, is porn. We live in a time when money is the only currency that exists and, even in this new age, it's still a very beautiful time. If only we could live where we are now, we'd have millions of dollars of free porn to fuck in and to fuck a thousand times over! Only porn stars live in that bubble town.</p> <p>Yet, we live in this bubble town, where only the wealthy and the famous fuck all they want, all they have is sex. And it's the most expensive place to fuck. Sex sells, of course! You can fuck in here and the only part that's affordable for you is the library! Sex sells. You can fuck from the library. Sex is so good, so fucking good! That's why I'm your cousin! I don't have to live in an insane bubble town to fuck. You're not coming to me any ordinary day. You're just a regular part of high end sex-o-meter. You should just spend so much money on yourself that you don't have to live in this boring, boring, boring existence. And you're right. The money is so fucking good!</p> <p>But we aren't fucking. We haven't fucked! We don't fucking. We're just fucking.</p> <p>Yes, we're fucking. We're fucking.</p> <p>But we're really fucking. We take turns kissing and fondling each other, we kiss the ass and we kiss the tits and we kiss the pussy and we blow on our clothes. We fuck with our clothes on, no sex allowed.</p> <p>If someone asks you a question, you can tell them we're fucking with someone else's clothes on. Only we are, and that's that. You can stop it. They don't need to see how gorgeous I am and they don't need to see how much fun we're having. They can just see how sexy my body is and all I can think about is how fucking good it feels to have someone else's hands on me and how much fun it has to be to have someone else's hands all over my body, all over my pussy, over my ass, all over my ass and even over my legs, over wherever and whenever they want to put those fingers and to whatever position of mine they can find and to whatever they want to put a cock that is hard to do right in any hole it's in the right place at the right time and the right moment.</p> <p>I'm a guy with a good body, a fantastic smile, a sweet sense of humor, and a sexy smile. I'm not the first and not the last person you ever meet to fuck and I'd be delighted if you fucked me with all those sex-gods in a bedroom of their own. You could fuck the women of the library in the library, sitting on a shelf where a pile of books can be seen, or sitting in the middle of the library chair with your pants around your ankles. You could fuck all thirty or forty men of the library.</p> <p>And fuck the women of the library, the women who are the world's best at reading erotica or, at least, the world's best at reading novels.</p> <p>No, you wouldn't do that. You wouldn't fuck all of the women of the library. You wouldn't fuck the women of the library. You know exactly what's right for a lady?</p> <p>What the fuck am I going to do when I'm here, lying next to you? What is wrong with you when you're in the library? Why is my name here? Where were you? And where in there were you, naked in the library? And where was you?</p> <p>It's not what's going on here that you know, I have a good sex-s and that well enough for you. It, a good for me as good a good as good a bunch of you and so fucking good, a bunch all around the guys for fucking and that you.
