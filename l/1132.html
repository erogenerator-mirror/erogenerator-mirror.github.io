This, as the reader knows, happened from time to time, at very long intervals. He remained absent a day</strong> but the next day he flew home just before it arrived in April. He was back home, alone.</p> <p>He had already spent a lot of time on the flight. And the next day he had gone to the airport to visit his mother. But, after a month, they came back and he hadn't had much to do with either. He tried to spend time with his mother. When she saw him, he was immediately aware of his presence. The first time she saw him her jaw just dropped. She didn't move away. She stared. It started a short distance away, followed by a long stretch. This was followed by another long stretch and then a long kiss. Then, her hands were everywhere. Soon, her feet were pressing against his bare chest. She had taken off her heels. When his cock was fully erect, she had taken off her skirt. She felt it press against her. Now it was straining against her. Slowly, she lifted it and dropped it in with the rest of her clothing. Now, it was pressing against her stomach and on her body. She felt it press against her belly button. She was so horny she had to do something to scratch the itch right along. And, the thought of it drove her on. She felt him pressing her against the wall. Soon she was pressing in against him with her feet. She felt his strong hands on her bare thighs as he made his way closer and closer. Soon, she felt his cock poking against her. She had never been touched by a man before.</p> <p>She slowly slid her panties aside and felt him push against her. He had never done anything like the first time he touched her. Now, she felt him pressing against her opening. His cock was still hard. And it was pressing her and she felt his cockhead pressing against her opening. She pushed her hips forward involuntarily and her head dropped on the back of her calves. She slowly moved forward. Her whole body moved forward. She felt like her head was sliding in on the floor. Suddenly, she felt herself being open. She wasn't sure if she wanted to. Her legs opened instinctively to engulf him. Her whole body was on fire and she began to rock her hips as she felt herself get closer to him. She was completely sure his cock was inside her and she needed to feel it inside and then she felt his cock head pressing against her opening. She gasped when she felt him touch her there. He didn't penetrate her there.</p> <p>She felt herself open to the whole of his cock. It was as if he was moving on its own. There was no pain there. It seemed like it would be so easy for her to open up to him. Her whole body tingled as she felt it start to penetrate her. His cock took every inch of her. It felt as if it was completely inside her. As she felt it slowly slide in and out without touching herself, she felt something else. It almost felt that she was being fucked by a man. She wasn't sure if it felt good or horrible after all of the pain in the previous weeks. It felt so good she didn't care. Her entire body was burning with hot, throbbing anticipation. She closed her eyes to savor the feeling and feel. She opened wide, letting him take over. His cock began moving at an even faster pace. It didn't feel as bad as she had thought it would. His cock felt great inside her. She felt like her whole body was on fire. And she was loving it. Her body was ready to explode at any minute. She wanted to feel every inch of his big cock.</p> <p>He began to move his hips too. His cock was moving around inside her. It made her body tingle and her feet were pressed against the wall. His cock never left her body. Every other inch of it was still inside. He was pulling the walls of her pussy down against him on every stroke. Suddenly, she felt a tightness around her pussy and it felt as if someone had put some kind of rubber between his cock and her pussy. It felt like his cock was moving in and out of her. Her whole body seemed to be moving at once. She felt as if her vagina was being moved by his cock. It made her feel like her entire body, was moving with him and she felt as if every nerve inside her body was moving at the same time. It felt as if he was still inside her and she wanted to scream in ecstasy.</p> <p>He felt her pussy squeeze around him every time he thrust forward. He was so close. He knew it was her turn now. His body knew what it wanted. He began to move fast and hard. His hips drove his cock with each thrust. It seemed as if it was like a piston. He was the piston. It seemed she wanted more like she wanted to drive her as her. It wanted her body felt as if she. His body needed him as she needed him—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
