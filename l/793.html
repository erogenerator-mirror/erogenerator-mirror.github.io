They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft place</strong> to go they were all in the middle of a group.</p> <p>"So what are you looking for?" asked a voice from across the ocean.</p> <p>There was no reply. And in front of the boat they heard, "We want to watch you fuck one of your guys."</p> <p>"Fuck what?"</p> <p>They hadn't heard anyone call that. "We want to get naked and fuck one of your guys."</p> <p>Not even an inch from his face. Not that they could see what was on his mind. Not that anyone else could either except them. But if they were going to do it. They should. It must actually be something.</p> <p>"They're not going to bother us," said a voice that came from a little far off. A moment later an open bottle of wine opened with a smile, "The party is ready."</p> <p>And it was.</p> <p>---------------------------------------------</p> <p>"Fuck. Yeah," said a couple, "I mean...it feels good." And it did.</p> <p>And they knew it did and it did because it was an absolutely amazing feeling.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------</p> <p>"This is how it works," said a voice that sounded like Bill.</p> <p>"It's different," said another voice. Bill knew from this that it was definitely something new.</p> <p>"Oh, you like fucking the way I do?" said another. And something else.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you on that huge black dick you're wearing."</p> <p>"You're going to fuck me up the ass, too."</p> <p>"Honey you'll like that."</p> <p>"But that'll be with this guy," said another voice, "This one."</p> <p>"Hey, man, just because he looks as big as you do doesn't mean he feels the same way."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know. You just know how to pick 'em. He's cute."</p> <p>"This thing with the fish." Said another voice.</p> <p>"Yeah, you got him," said another male voice.</p> <p>"You like him, don't you, you hot pussy hussy."</p> <p>"What if I don't?"</p> <p>And this time when they looked, they couldn't take their eyes off him. This was all the first cock he'd ever seen. He was a little short, maybe five-two and thin. Nice abs, even if he was a little thin. His pants went up just above his knees. He was so white they didn't even fit. He looked like a guy's twin if a guy's twin. Not just a guy's brother. More like a guy's ex-wife. A pretty but not really, but even when he's naked he looks like a woman. He was skinny but still...just nice, if I ever saw one. A pretty little tigress at that.</p> <p>The man that had been standing right next to them all that evening, was no more than five-five. He had a good build too. If all the male members watched him it would have been obvious his size was because of his skin tone. But he looked the same as every woman they'd ever seen. Same hair and the same eyes, he was blonde and he had a nice tan, and he looked as naked as everyone else, and his skin was perfectly smooth.</p> <p>Some parts were pretty good. Some parts weren't. When I'm naked and I'm laying in those two men's arms he's got a nice ass. And those hands are pretty much the same as all your other male friends. And the same color, like the guy in the water.</p> <p>And if I'm standing right next to the guy I just fucked and the man standing next to me, his arms are as beautiful as his naked ass I'd feel like I might fall over and die if I didn't make a connection between him and my cock.</p> <p>But if the guy in front had been a guy I'd make him come like I'd like to come, and he could fuck me hard. He had the same color and the same hair as his ex-wife and he had a pretty face and those eyes that just made me feel real good.</p> <p>And so did the cock. He was a big cocksucker and I'm pretty sure he knew it. And he was going to be doing that again.</p> <p>"The rest of us will be there," said Bill. "It's all fair's fair. The way we pay our mates, the only ones we don't fuck are the ones we have to be satisfied with."</p> <p>-----------------------------------------</p> <p>"I just finished fucking the guy from the water," said the voice. "But I got to take care about how it, not get to make it right then.</p> <p>"That's not the guy," said the voice. But a guy, that," said the voice, and the voiceâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
