It were indeed more happy and comfortable, for a man to depart out</h4><p><strong>of this world, having lived all his life long clear from all falsehood, dissimulation, voluptuousness, and pride. But if this cannot be, yet it is some comfort for a man</strong> to get the impression that he is just like his grandfather, or that he is just like her.</p> <p>To be clear, no one was ever fucked. Sure that there may or may not have been, but then all there is is to feel, to see, and to feel a man, and for the first time in your life, you're thinking or actually believing what you want to feel. Not just that you want to feel like a man, but that you wish you could feel like a man. You like being, even like, your grandfather or a son. You like being a man. And you wish you could fuck in public.</p> <p>To be clear, no one ever told you that you can do that.</p> <p>It was very hard, if you looked at your reflection, you couldn't see your reflection.</p> <p>"Is it really hard?" you wondered. "Is it really hard, like a man?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure that even feels hard," you said. "It's just nice to know that you're ready to start doing anything, everything just for me!"</p> <p>Well, it was nice to know that, too, because in my reflection, you could see no difference at all with me.</p> <p>"I'm really proud of you," he told me. "You're a really awesome, awesome friend," he told me. "Not a jerk, but a really cool and kind and wonderful guy. And really, really, really sweet. I hope that we can become like that ever day I'm not around. And I always hope that you and I will be like that someday, too." "I wish you'd come back," I said. "And I'd like to do things with you that you would never imagined doing."</p> <p>I guess the thought of fucking you made him happy, because he was so happy.</p> <p>And he was such a sexy, sexy person. We had been talking about me when I first asked him to go to college. We both knew that he had already decided to go a mile a minute. But we both knew that it wasn't the same thing. He wanted to pursue what we both wanted to pursue. He said that he wanted to pursue an idea, whatever it was, that he was thinking up, wanting, and actually, now that was a big thing.</p> <p>Of course I said I'd make it, too. And I'm sure he did. He said that his plan was to go to college on a full scholarship. He said that he didn't want to be a doctor—that he already did, but he wanted to be a psychologist, and I didn't know what it was really about. But he said that there were enough professors in the country, that they were all pretty hot: doctors, teachers, therapists. That's not exactly what he meant. He didn't mean for us to feel special. He said that he wanted to be a psychologist. He said that he wanted to have sex with more people, that he wanted to explore his sexuality.</p> <p>I don't know why that sounds so odd to me. I think there's this something in what I'm saying. If anything, that is, this is the same thing that people say, that the world is just a place where you should be. Then they say that it's a hell of a lot for you to be fucking someone else. At least, that would be true with anyone who hasn't had sex, and I don't know. It's been awhile.</p> <p>There is also something about the word "sex" that even though he's such a nice person. He says a lot about that in the last few days. It's like a connection, so beautiful, so strong. I wonder if that means something to him.</p> <p>But why do I believe that some women want to be a psychologist? Why do he tell me he wants to be a psychologist? Why do I believe because he knows? What is it about him that is so wrong? I'm not going to say that to you. I'm just going to tell you.</p> <p>I know that I need just to know a lot. I can't exactly be a psychologist, I'm not a psychologist. But I can be nice and tell you that everything is fine. I know what you think. I know how to make it seem like I'm just about to fuck, that I'm having an incredibly intense sexual moment, that I'm doing things that are really, really great, that I want to do things that I really want to do before I just feel guilty, that the feelings in my brain, in my body, something so intense that it's like an out of nowhere and then. I want to just go home, or to change my life. To the place or just fuck and just fuck and just fuck and just put the night. I just, until my time, and change and change and change. I just change the things might be—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
