The Lemonade</h4><p><strong>Morrel was, in fact, very happy. M. Noirtier had just sent for him, and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had</strong> taken his cellophane out of his pocket, and had found it, and had been reading it, and knew that he was in that, too. "Momma!" he had exclaimed. "It's been ages... ever since that first morning," He'd chuckled, and he had said it once, and he'd continued looking at his cell, and he remembered it in his mind, and he was still looking at it all the time, and he'd gone through his whole life. And he knew it.</p> <p>"You look so damned pretty," He'd said, and as M. Noirti laughed at him, he couldn't help himself. He felt his dick jerk a little, he'd been so hard, and it had rubbed against the satin of his suit. "I mean, it's so fucking gorgeous," He'd said, and as he'd laughed, M. Noirti had licked her lips, and smiled at him, and had returned her smile, and had continued looking at it as it lay in his palm. He'd been so close he could feel her hot breath on his tip, and he had been moaning, and he'd been pushing his hard dick against his suit, too. And now he was watching it, while M. Noirti stood at the edge of the bed smiling. "I love that," He'd smiled at M. Noirti, and continued to watch his erection.</p> <p>He had smiled. "I was about to ask you where it was coming from," M. Noirti had said, her lips had slid down to kiss him, and he'd grinned, but his heart had stopped pounding so hard it was breaking inside his chest, and he had felt it jump inside his suit, and it'd jerked against his pants. "I know it's weird," M. Noirti had grinned, and he'd smiled back, and he'd continued looking down. "I can't tell you everything," M. Noirti had said, and smiled, and she'd looked up into his eyes. "I promise I won't," She'd said, and her lips had slid down his neck. He'd smiled, and he'd reached out both hands, and had held her shoulders. "Hey," M. Noirti had said, and he'd sat up. The feeling of him had moved to his cock, and he'd felt the stiffness inside, and he'd felt the sudden pulse of it against his legs, and then as he'd looked down at his hard on, just to make sure, and he'd looked back up at her, smiling. "It's still hard, doesn't it?" M. Noirti had giggled. "Don't you worry, honey," M. Noirti had said again, leaning forward and kissing him. And as he'd smiled so softly, and his hands had slid down and around the top of her top, they had slid up, and they'd found the hem of her dress, lifting it up so she could feel his hard dick pressed up there, and he had reached his hand up inside her top and found the bottom of one of her breasts and cupped it, and as he'd been leaning over so close, he'd been sliding his hand up inside her top, and M. No, M. Noirti wasn't wearing a bra, and she'd said so, when she'd told him to play with her titties. He'd smiled and lifted her top so that his hand had slid out to feel her other breast, and although he had loved to touch her breasts, M. Noirti had said, "Play with my breasts." And he had. So very much! He hadn't meant to, and she hadn't been able to control it. He'd liked her tits so much, and he'd been thinking and dreaming of fucking her tits, and he remembered her saying that she liked everything. "I like what you're doing," He'd told her, smiling back at her. M. Noirti had lifted her top, and he'd been leaning over her so close. That had made him so hot he'd had reached out to stroke that wonderful set of breasts too. And as he'd gently caressed and caressed them, he'd been wondering what it would feel like to have his hand wrapped around her naked breasts, in her bra and in her top, and he'd wanted it to feel just as good as she'd wanted him to touch her breasts. And now M. Noirti had lifted her top up so far, and revealed all that gorgeous set of breasts and he'd been stroking her breasts and feeling and stroking her big, and rubbing her nipples and caressing, he'd wanting so bad he'd wanting it. Then he'd been whispering so much, "M. Want it had gone "I want" to think and wanting to be "Oh.
