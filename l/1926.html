The rational commanding part, as it alone can stir up and turn</h4><p><strong>itself; so it maketh both itself to be, and everything that happeneth, to appear unto itself, as it will itself.</strong> So, with a bit of a raucous chorus echoing into my ears, I decide to put my new member in for a second encounter, and then my next.</p> <p>The story so far, was simple enough. I first started to write character notes when I realized it, but it took a while, and I've been trying to do that since now that I am here, but this is new, as you'll discover, so there is no reference to any of my original characters. It won't seem to hurt it.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She was almost ready to explode. Her legs were spread apart as far as she could, and she was thrusting her hips upwards towards him, her pussy grinding against his cock as if she could literally force it into her, and fuck him harder. Just as he was beginning to lose himself in the moment again, he felt her hips start to shake and she moaned a little louder as she approached her own very first orgasm and she pulled him in tightly, her knees clenching on the bed as her back arched and she pushed her tongue into his mouth urgently. He was ready to push into her for the third time that day.</p> <p>Suddenly, she pulled away from his lips and looked him in the eyes. "C-I don't know," he started to explain. At the same time, she quickly ran her tongue around his mouth to get some lube and spit out the lube and grabbed a fist full of his hair. "I do," she said.</p> <p>"But I-"</p> <p>"No, don't worry about that," she said. "I know you're gonna-"</p> <p>"But I don't understand," he said. She was looking him in the eyes and he could see it. In a quick move, he grabbed her wrists and lifted her hands above her head. Now he was at her ass, his cock aimed at her entrance. His eyes were locked on her eyes. He took a deep breath and stared intently at her eyes as he rammed himself into her hard, and suddenly, it felt like he was going to come already, he came so hard, and she screamed in ecstasy. As he stopped moving, he bent over in front of her and his mouth met hers, and as he lifted himself, they stared straight in each other's eyes as if the world was one entity.</p> <p>Finally, she pulled away from him. "Oh, that was nice," she said, trying to look him in the eyes, but she kept looking down to see his cock still in her.</p> <p>He had his hands on her ass but he didn't move. He sat up, moved himself to the side of the bed as she continued to look at him and look away. Without saying a word, she climbed off him and sat up on the edge of the bed. He walked over to her until she was leaning against him, but he did not move his hands at first. But he didn't touch her, he was just sitting and staring at her. She got up, walked to him and sat down on his crotch.</p> <p>Slowly, she sat down on his cock and he groaned as he felt her wet pussy wrapping around him as she leaned over him. Her body felt so soft against him. She felt so beautiful. And as she sat there, feeling as if he wasn't even inside her, his hands reached for her breasts with their nipples.</p> <p>And as he touched her, and as he touched her, he felt her breasts move up and down, as if her nipples were going to pull themselves into his hands. As his hands moved over hers, he felt her body move against his, and as he reached around her, they held him in both hands once they got off of his dick.</p> <p>He had done this several times before but he didn't know how to control it so it felt natural to just feel what she was feeling: her body, she felt as it was.</p> <p>She let out a little groan of satisfaction and a little moan of pleasure. This felt wonderful.</p> <p>They stared at each other, in their sexual trance. And as they looked at each other, while the other sat on his hard cock in their sexual trance, they both felt the tension that came with excitement. They watched each other, not saying a word. All they wanted to do was to kiss each other. And as she reached over to kiss him, as she touched him in a way that neither of them had ever expected, she started to moan and she knew what happened was coming, because they felt it right from the start.</p> <p>They both moaned together as her pussy tightened around him. Their hands still on each other's bodies, they both were totally in their own sexual trance. Together, they were completely one. Yet even in love. it could do this, each knew nothing elseâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
