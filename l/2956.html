She sighed, then blushed again and opened her mouth slightly.</p> <p>"I thought you were just going to watch," he said. He knew full well the feeling of her wetness, and the fact that his erection was pressing up against her inner thigh.</p> <p>"It's been a long time," she said. She reached down and cupped his balls, then squeezed them playfully.</p> <p>"Are you ready for some nice, big cock now?" he asked as he stood up, and strode toward the chair where her father sat. He took her hand, and led her into the living room.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>When Jason put his arm around Gloria's shoulders, she reached up and pulled his face against her neck, then nibbled her ear.</p> <p>"We've all decided that church and the church is going to shut down at the start of the service for a little while," he said. "Don't we want just a little taste of all of those pussy and cock today?"</p> <p>"Yes you do, honey," she replied with a grin. "We've all decided that church and the church aren't going to shut down anytime soon," she said, and then added, "We've also decided that we want to just keep going. We love you and we just want to keep fucking you."</p> <p>"Well, if it's not going to be too much later," he said, and then led her into the family room.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>While he walked to the front of the cabin where the kitchen was, Jason went to the refrigerator. He popped open the top, and pulled out the can of beer. He tossed it in on the kitchen tray in front of the table. A minute later, he looked back toward the cabin door and said, "We're going to use the table downstairs this way. You can sit on the table and have a glass or two of beer."</p> <p>"I hope we don't stop at the bottom of the first floor," he said.</p> <p>"I'm sure you can find a place to sit where you want," she replied as she crossed her legs. He looked around a minute. "And I'm sure the upstairs bathroom will be free."</p> <p>"You'd better use the kitchen because we've got to stop to get our stuff and get the doors," he said. "When we are finished with them, you can have coffee before lunch when you get your food. If we aren't finished, we'll start."</p> <p>"Yes, sir," she said and then turned back toward the kitchen.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Gloria was in the kitchen while Jason entered it. She had her back against the door and leaned against Jason's chest as the door began to close out. Jason wrapped his arms around her as they sat quietly next to each other. He knew her neck was still red from his lips brushing against it, but didn't care. His cock was throbbing as he watched her eyes widen and her face morph into one of anticipation.</p> <p>"The door opened at the other end so quickly," she whispered. Then she turned her head and kissed Jason on the mouth. Jason pressed his lips against hers until she opened her mouth and his tongue invaded her mouth.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>When Jason's arms and legs encircled Gloria, she pushed against the door as his fingers pinched her nipples through the cloth of her blouse.</p> <p>"Gonna get the coffee started before lunch," Jason said.</p> <p>"And we may continue this a little later," she said. "Can I ask you a question?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Do you like porn?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you like sex?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well, sort of," she said, still squeezing his nipples through the shirt he wore. "I kind of like sex. I mean, if you weren't my pastor and I wasn't in your church, I'd like to fuck you. Do you like to fuck?"</p> <p>"That's a big step for me," Jason said. "A girl just has to be in the right place at the right time, and she can always find someone like you with her life and her love for her pastor, too."</p> <p>"What about the Church?" she asked, and then paused before adding, "Do I like you do the church, have to join with the Church or to become my pastor for the whole parishion?"</p> <p></p> <p>"Jesus, you want for you will to be here." I do," Jason responded.
