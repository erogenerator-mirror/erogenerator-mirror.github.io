He put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed, it was the</strong> funniest thing he'd ever heard.</p> <p>And then he had to fuck one. He did just what he would do any day. He fucked every woman he saw or thought of, every woman he wanted.</p> <p>There was only one reason this is what men will do for their partners. Because any woman with two men, as well as two women who share their heart would never have her heart broken.</p> <p>His girlfriend, a woman named Sarah, had taken him on a road trip. It wasn't just his relationship with her that made her happy. There was something in their relationship that made him feel good. She was a goddess, no? But he couldn't bring himself to tell her the truth, especially about her boyfriend, and she wasn't her boyfriend. It surprised him, and he wanted to break that connection.</p> <p>But he didn't need to do that. Sarah and he were friends. There was nothing that could ruin a friendship.</p> <p>He wasn't happy.</p> <p>At least, he wasn't sure if he wanted to be. Now that he thought about it, he wanted to be different. He wanted to be someone's friend and not have to sleep with any woman you meet as opposed to be somebody's best friend. And he wasn't sure that was what he wanted to be. He wanted to give love, and more than that, he wanted a woman.</p> <p>She wasn't the boyfriend of a porn star. She wasn't the best lover you might ever have. And she wasn't the best lover that you might ever want in your next boyfriend. And she wasn't the most passionate lover that you could have had in your next life. If he hadn't already made her cum, she would be no matter what he did to her during her first day of dating.</p> <p>He wanted the right person in his life, a woman. He didn't want to be a jerk to her because he would never consider her his girlfriend.</p> <p>In fact, he couldn't believe that, considering the last one. He had to meet a woman. Not only did she have the best body he'd ever seen, but a body that could make his dick hard as hell. And that she was sexy. And not just any body, but a whole lot of body.</p> <p>That was why he fucked Sarah so hard. If she was as hot as she thought she was, he wanted to have sex with her at least once. He'd always dreamed about fucking a woman in the ass, and he knew that she wouldn't be as good in the ass as she was in fucking a man.</p> <p>But she couldn't compare herself to him.</p> <p>He shook his head.</p> <p>She was gorgeous.</p> <p>He looked at her face. She was different than anyone else he had ever seen, but he could tell that she enjoyed being with him. She was no longer his girlfriend to the point that he didn't know who he was. She was no longer his teacher, a friend of his roommate.</p> <p>It was only her. Of course, it wasn't a friendship. It was a life, and she would be happy to share it with everyone, but he only had one of what he had with Sarah.</p> <p>But the closest he had been to that, she was a woman of love.</p> <p>Her eyes caught his as he looked her over. She had a smile the first time he had ever seen her, and he couldn't believe that she would be into him.</p> <p>"So, how do you like your new girlfriend?" she asked him.</p> <p>It was a rhetorical question, but it wasn't something an average man would ask of his woman. It was something you saw in movies and books and online. He was sure that he knew what he was talking about.</p> <p>Sarah nodded her head and smiled a knowing smile.</p> <p>"She is a very sweet and generous person who I don't think can help you in your quest to have a girl friend," she said.</p> <p>"A woman friend?" he said. "You mean a woman friend?"</p> <p>"I think so," she said simply. "I don't know if I'll ever find a woman who appreciates being with you. You're a very, very fine specimen who deserves to be with someone as gorgeous as you."</p> <p>He looked at her face again. He thought that she was a pretty beautiful woman, he thought that she would make a fine partner. He saw no doubt she had other things in mind than sex with her boyfriend, and he couldn't help but wonder how he could possibly satisfy her other fantasies while he could get on with his life.</p> <p>He also wondered how he'd he possibly ever get by her. He saw no reason to doubt that she wouldn't give him love her at all the same things she did with him.</p> <p>There was that she said that while she was that she was that she was that he was that he would—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
