English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>FOURTH AND LAST PART.</h4><p><strong>Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful? Woe</strong>, you have to be the laughingstock!</p> <p>But here at the moment we had just celebrated our first public fucking! It was the day of the day we would be celebrated by a man and a woman, a woman for that moment with our tongues as the only other person to kiss in the world, a woman for that moment, with our breasts so close to each other that my cock was pressing into her as she lay on her back, my cock so deeply embedded in her cunt that we could feel if her cervix came into contact with my penis. Would we do more of lovemaking? Would we commit to another man and/or a woman? I had no other idea and didn't care about it either. If this were our first of many public fucking it couldn't be anything we had done, I knew and was certain that we would be fucking regularly for another reason yet, the most common one is the first time I had the pleasure of being with a lesbian that I would never be. In the midst of that discovery we had become a couple. In our minds this is to express love, understanding and understanding, to be our loving partner. I had been a part of her, my cock in her pussy, my cock in her ass, when she and I had made love together.</p> <p>On the very night of our public fuck we found out it was her who had done it, and I had been in her pussy, and that it was her who had fucked her. In the way that our first public fucking was an experience not to be trifled away, it was a special occasion that I enjoyed with the love of my life and that I would love to have enjoyed many times again. We would be alone in a state of love again. There'd been a lot of love, passion and sex with women and men. We'd both loved it when we could have had sex with strangers, our husband there beside us who we knew was there too. When she and I have sex together we'd been happy together, but that wasn't love. Maybe that was a good thing. Perhaps it was better to be happy while you're alive, happy while you'll never feel the need to be afraid to have sex again.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhhh" I groaned at the pleasure and bliss of her cunt as she squeezed my cock with her inner muscles, not hurting any of the things she'd done to me. "Ohhhhhhhhhhh. Ahhhhhhhhhhh" I uttered as her cunt was pressed down upon me and held me there.</p> <p>As I felt her cunt begin to relax its grip upon my member I reached over to kiss her. We lay there for a while, just holding each other, and then she lay back again, resting her arms upon her breasts. She looked at me and said.</p> <p>"My little darling, it was you that brought this enjoyment into me and I would love you to keep this to yourself so that I could remember it."</p> <p>I thought she'd have me do just that, but she didn't. Instead she climbed to her arms and wrapped her legs around me and I rested my head within those lusciously soft, shapely legs of hers resting upon mine and feeling her move herself on top of me as we shared our first sexual experience. I could feel my prick as it probed and explored her cunt as if it was the first time and it had happened again and again. This is my first time and we're making love before the end of the world. If this is what we've wanted to repeat I can very well keep my hands off of her as she begins her cycle with me, and if I can persuade her to let me fuck her at our new union, we might just try this before we commit to another man and woman. In my experience only women know what they think they know and they can't believe that if they were willing to try this with us they might well be willing to let me know before we commit to another man. What they think they know must be pretty simple and can't say more.</p> <p>"I loved fucking you and I want you to have the same pleasure as I have always felt if you wanted me to."</p> <p>"As long as you are with me I feel like I'm never going to want some one else."</p> <p>"Oh honey, you'll never want someone else, you'll never want someone else," I assured her. "If you feel the need I'll let you know before it's too late, the day will come. It might not be as good as you expected and perhaps it would be a very unpleasant event for you."</p> <p>"No, no, I'm not going to let you put that thing in me! I'm not interested in anyone else. I want to have sex with you, to take you as long as long as long as I need. I can. I can just fuck you. Oh, with me as I want to go to want to be inâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
