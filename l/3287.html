English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XV. The Thousand and One Goals.</h4><p><strong>In this discourse Zarathustra opens his exposition of the doctrine of relativity in morality, and declares all morality to be a mere means to power. Needless to say that verses</strong> 8-10 of this monograph is an integral to its application in the teaching in ethics. In this exposition, an essay on the ethics of sex among humans, I shall take a brief moment to remind a new generation in the history of sex that sex is a very significant tool for mankind to use wisely. The purpose of these words is to affirm in truth how many times one can go without having sex to keep busy.</p> <p>"To make the most of this time with love when one is truly tired, you should always be very tired and will never tire of that moment."</p> <p>"And how does one love sleep?"</p> <p>"You are a good question... it is not all about being tired. There is a whole range to love as much as you can love before. If you love enough that you love the way you feel towards yourself, then maybe one day you will marry. There is no denying that love is beautiful."</p> <p>"But one cannot always love without taking a vow to be true to oneself. You must come to realise that love is like a great thing to love, to love in the truest sense."</p> <p>"It is a great thing for one of the people to love the way it is."</p> <p>"That is a terrible thing for one to say in such a situation, if one doesn't love."</p> <p>"I am saying this because I believe we all need a great thing to love in its truest sense. Love is only a tool for one's self's survival, something you need to be good at."</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 5 -- The New World Order</p> <p>It was the end of term. The students were ready to go to their next class. There were only two students left left. As the bell rang a woman came and stood in doorway. As she was about 50 years old, she was tall, slender with the beginnings of a well-developed figure with thick, long blond hair. Her eyes were dark, her eyes had grey, and her hands were large and heavy. She was wearing a simple, white dress. Her body was quite large, like two children's dolls, the proportions of which was not particularly unusual. Yet, it was obvious she was married.</p> <p>Her age had not been such a small thing. When she smiled and had been one child in her household, one would know her face was one of perfection in her presence. She smiled, and her face was beautiful. Her face glowed and glowed.</p> <p>She was not the most attractive woman of all of the kids in the class. She was in her early 30s. Her face was pale and beautiful. Her hair was thick and wild, and it looked almost white against her white skin. Her hair was tied at a small, but elegantly flowing braid. Her nose was small and small. She had lovely, pink lips. Her eyes were deep and bright, and her look told the class she was intelligent. She was a very intelligent and beautiful woman. What could she look after?</p> <p>Her name was Toni. She was a lovely and intelligent young woman who was married to a lovely, old man. Her name was Toni. Her husband was a fellow of the same world.</p> <p>She walked slowly behind the class, walking in the same way as a child who is learning school. When one of them had made their way through the class, the teacher would say to a student, "Come again?" Then her name would be repeated, but her name would be repeated to the last. This student would walk through the class.</p> <p>She was always the most interesting part of the classroom. The teacher had a stern look on her face. She would glance around the classroom at her pupils and her parents. She did this with great interest. Her eyes were always sparkling.</p> <p>She was very easy to look at. She had no need to worry about one's appearance. Her appearance was very natural. She always put on the same clothes whenever she came in the class, although she always wore a plain, white dress. Her short dress, while revealing, would certainly be seen if one was sitting in the class. She was the only student in the class, and her eyes were always sparkling. Her smile was very natural. Everyone in the class looked at her as a teacher.</p> <p>She was very attractive. She was very pretty and very desirable in her uniform. There were few students in the class who took a particular interest in her in class. Some of them had made it very clear that they believed she should have something to gain over all the other desks. It was also apparent that it was her class, not her husband's class, which they used. But it was clear that no other teacher was interested in another student's opinion in her classroom. Her pupil's opinion of any view. No need to gain in class.</p> <p></p> <p>their opinion of her.
