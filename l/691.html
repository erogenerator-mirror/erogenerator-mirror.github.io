Pierre was somewhat of a gentleman and after they had talked for so long on the telephone it had been an idea to meet him here. He had a flat and he used his car to drive there. He arrived in the early evening and when he got out of bed he immediately went to the bathroom and started drinking beer and smoking. After smoking he decided to take a shower and after he had washed his clothes a while before he took a quick wash and began drying.</p> <p>He noticed that his prick started to come again and he realized that he was in love with this man. He also realized that he was feeling guilty about seeing Pierre's prick. He got out his shower and sat on the toilet again and started to jerk his cock but suddenly he decided to wash again, so he went to his dresser and took out his clothes. As he stood up he thought that he might just wash his hands and take them out in the shower but instead he stood in front and faced it and started to wash his body. Then as he began to shampoo soapsuds his prick came out of its wet state and began to rise again. He was still in love with Pierre and he took very slow and delicate movements to wash himself and when his hands got tired again he finished bathing himself and sat down again to wash his cock.</p> <p>Now he was totally relaxed as he started to wash his prick again. The washing was a lot more sensual as he washed his legs, his stomach and his arms. After long minutes of washing his body Pierre got up from the toilet and washed his hair, and after drying his hair Pierre took a brush and made him stand up. He had a large mirror on the wall so Pierre could see him. Pierre took out a wet sponge and started to make thick, fluffy water and started to make it into a warm bath. The water felt good after a long day of washing as it felt more relaxed and sensual. It started to get hot as Pierre bathed him.</p> <p>A bit later, when Pierre had finished bath in the bath with a cloth, he led him to his bedroom and took him out into the big bed and said, "Lie down". Pierre took him on pillows and said, "Let me do your armpits first". Pierre went to the closet and came back and sat down, with a towel wrapped around his waist. After a few minutes he said to Pierre, "You don't have much hair yet" and he pulled the towel away from him to reveal a very pretty and sexy face. Pierre then said, "You can go and watch the movie if you want" and he proceeded to do his hair while Pierre watched the movie.</p> <p>Pierre was still lying on his back with his eyes closed when a warm shower started to wash over him and he almost sighed in pleasure. Pierre turned around and saw that by lying on his back that he had a large and beautiful ass. Pierre turned the shower off and took out the bath hose and began to bathe himself. By the time Pierre was down to his underwear, his penis was fully erect and he got off the bed and went to sleep in a few minutes, but in his sleep he was shocked to realize that his cock now had a very angry and angry looking head. It took Pierre a while to put it to sleep and when he came to again he was lying in a huge bed with a sheet draped over his naked and sweaty body except his arms in which Pierre had tied it a couple years ago but he did nothing about it.</p> <p>Pierre slept for some time and was totally exhausted. He didn't know what to do or what to do about this situation but before he had his usual shower he woke to an idea that somehow a very special part of his anatomy didn't seem to be covered by the bed sheet anymore. He didn't tell Pierre that even when his penis was exposed, he should cover it. After about half an hour Pierre got back in his own bed and as he looked around he thought he had forgotten about the bathroom key but it would have seemed to be inside the bathroom door.</p> <p>When Pierre went into his bath, he found his penis erect again and it was very erect, too. He looked into the mirror again and his face was even more beautiful and sexy. Pierre looked at it once and he saw that his penis was longer but it also had a very different shaped shape. But his penis was bigger than his entire torso and his skin didn't look like he grew it every other day either. Then Pierre touched it again and was surprised to find his cock got harder again, especially when he put his hand on it and realized that he felt it's softness again. Pierre had never felt an erection like this.</p> <p>Pierre then put his hand on top of the top of the bath and again felt his penis growing penis was almost as hot as smooth as all his body felt. He felt it was very soft in a different and warm as he had this morning, it moved his body and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
