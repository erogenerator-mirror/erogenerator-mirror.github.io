As always, she looked like one of the famous 'Barby' actress on the screen. She'd lost a lot of weight from the weight loss pills, so the last remnants of her health had been lost too. She was a beautiful and very desirable girl—and there was no shortage of men on the market. However, it would also have been a shame if they had made for a bad impression. I'm not so lucky.</p> <p>The problem with being a big-breasted lady, anyway, was you tend to lose a little weight whenever the time in your life's on. Your bust is also getting worse if you take the pill and go to a fancy lingerie shop; the lingerie store had better taste in lingerie because they sold real women's wear...something like an a dozen-string variety of silken suspenders or some sort of string.</p> <p>My wife, not having a single boyfriend for many months now, was looking at a skimpy black bikini in the window of the lingerie store. I saw it first; she gave me a look; I pretended that I hadn't heard it, and we both looked down at the skimpy garment. She smiled, and I blushed under the pretext that the woman behind me was buying some very sexy bras and panties. She was about to open the window when she looked up and saw my own bikini.</p> <p>"Wow! I like them," my wife said, with an approving nod, but then she looked down to see the skimpy suit.</p> <p>"I'll get another size," I said. The other one, a skimpy baby doll of pink fabric, barely covered my bottom. I was already feeling uncomfortable for my wife, and I felt a little uncomfortable walking down our hall naked by myself. She noticed, and smiled at my discomfort.</p> <p>"I'm not wearing them too often," she said, holding up what looked like one of the most revealing bikini's I'd ever seen. I felt bad for being embarrassed by her.</p> <p>"I don't feel like it anymore. It looks like these suits will just keep things from getting too revealing."</p> <p>"I can see you need a little help," my sweet wife said, and started running her fingers all over and between the bikini's top and her top. She was feeling particularly hot today.</p> <p>"Please. I'm a little shy."</p> <p>"Don't be afraid," she reassured, kissing my cheeks while she pushed the bikini into my hand. "Here, let me get these," she said, and handed a pair of small bikini panties to me. I took them and put them over my bottom.</p> <p>"These must be pretty bad."</p> <p>"They're not," she said, then pulled back the bikini top and pulled my bra off, but then put my breasts back on as she finished the task.</p> <p>"Are you going to try mine on, too?"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I'm kind of horny, and I'm not sure if I can wear these bikini's on the first day, anyway, you know?"</p> <p>"I know that's true. I'm sure the two of us can find something for you to wear." She gave me a long, lingering look; I was a little nervous: I wasn't sure where this was all going, what we were actually supposed to do.</p> <p>But at first I wasn't sure. Then, as she'd finished, she went upstairs to the guest room, where we usually undressed together and I got into bed. Then, after about ten minutes of getting under the sheets together, we snuggled together in an 'I'm not wearing it' mood. Then, when it got really hot, I got into bed with her. We were on our side of the bed, spooning with our backs to our heads, and we both just wanted to be comfortable. Then we were really, really comfortable. It was my first time making love with my wife as she was lying naked beside me. It was a moment of intimacy, of course, but it was the first time I'd felt a part of her in my whole life, and I was happy about it. I didn't want her to feel a bit guilty about wearing one of these new-fangled nylons for me to wear. When we were alone in a big house with the windows closed, I was sure she'd see me wearing those; she did, in fact. And, anyway, having her in that state, topless, of course, was just the icing on the cake. She wore a pair of pale, soft panties that really looked nice on me.</p> <p>"I know we can't go out, honey," she said, breaking the first, and making as my fingers slid between her smooth, slightly parted, smooth pussy lips. "But if you can we can stay here, and come over, okay.
