I found the Blue Boar</strong> Club, a gay nightclub, and spent a good six months trying to get laid at their regular rate—nothing I did was doing that with a group of guys I'd never met before.</p> <p>The guys on the table was just about to blow when someone approached me. It wasn't a bad looking guy. It was a cute, white guy, with a nice voice. "How do you like it?" I asked. My jaw was hanging down as he put his hand up to my face.</p> <p>"I...uh...nice." He nodded. "But you don't like my dick?" I nodded. He gave me my beer.</p> <p>"I've been looking forward to it for days, so here, get over here and suck it." He smiled, but he didn't say anything else.</p> <p>"You can talk," and before I could say anything more, he had his way to a kneeling position and had his beer down to my dick. God, I loved that. And it seemed to be going really well for both of us. I must've been aching, but the more he massaged my dick, the more my brain started to feel like it was in sync with him. As his mouth enveloped my length, my cock slid into his wet mouth in a way that made it hard to keep up with his speed, even when he did what he wanted to do.</p> <p>"Damn," I groaned. It felt great.</p> <p>"Yes, baby. You're not too bad yourself," he said. He worked his jaw as much as his technique so he could go faster while still stroking me with his lips. My eyes went up to see if I could feel anything other than his lips on my dick, but he was so damn good at that I wasn't trying to fuck him all the time, but just to feel my dick down his throat. The way he was sucking me and the way I'd felt was the sexiest thing I could've done, and it made me feel good to have him there and with him. And if there had been even any hint of what he was about to do, I would've wanted him there, too.</p> <p>By the time he swallowed my load into his throat, I was ready to blow because my orgasm was just about to happen. He didn't seem to miss a beat, he just kept on sucking. Just as he started massaging my balls between his lips, I let my hand find that glorious place along his shaft and wrapped my fingers around what felt like the world's most delicious cock. I'd never really felt anyone's cock before, either, but I had always felt like I had a lot of control on my own body. I let my fingers stroke a little more, then took his dick in my mouth and started stroking the rest, even as he just kept on sucking and jacking me off.</p> <p>It came on suddenly when I felt his fingers on my ass. We were all ready to pop again. So I stopped him from going on, but he just kept going.</p> <p>"Hang on to your beer!" his friend said.</p> <p>"He's taking a piss, dude," Dave said, standing up. The man who'd been sucking my cock a moment ago looked over and waved to him, and Dave waved back and laughed. "You guys are too much to handle." I looked over at him. He was sitting back in his booth, the seat down half-turned sideways, his pants were unzipped and the tip of his cock was poking out of its hole like some kind of neon sign that it was there. I thought it was hot and sexy all at the same time. I'd been thinking about that as my brain processed everything Dave had said and the way he wanted me to take off my pants for him.</p> <p>But I was too far gone—I didn't care what Dave said. I wanted him to take his pants off as soon as he got his dick out from under there. In fact, I wanted him to fuck his dick and go to work on the next dick he had in mind. He really wanted me to blow him, too. Or, he still wanted to watch me do the guy's shit. I leaned over and gave him a kiss. That was my last wish. I didn't give Dave his choice, I wasn't in charge any more, it was just what he thought.</p> <p>As his dick slid out, the first load of cum hit his stomach like a wave. The second load ended up in his mouth, even his face didn't look happy. His cock didn't seem to be looking very happy either.</p> <p>"Hang on," the first fellow said. "I want to do it."</p> <p>"Hey was all right. I was all right. He wanted to do it. I was all right. I wanted Dave to take his dick. I had made it. Dave.</p> <p>I leaned—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
