Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.</h4><p><strong>The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery, of which the waif may</strong> be a good guide.</p> <p>Also included in this chapter (and by the way, some of the rules are in the chapters that follow in part one), is a historical document. The rules of the whale fishery are known in part one but are also incorporated in part two. All relevant material in this chapter is considered to be relevant but are not essential, as I have no knowledge of the laws which govern the whale industry.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p> <p>Mummy and dad, (nanny and nanny), and mum, (nai and nai), and I</p> <p>My dad had moved to a place of his own, so I had no worries of getting bored, so I asked him, "Is mum going to be a good mum to your children, while dad is getting a new job in London?"</p> <p>"I won't take her for a lover," he said. "We don't want her to be a naughty naughty lover. We want to be fair."</p> <p>"Fair can be fair, fair can be fair," I told him, "I know what you mean. Don't get me wrong, I've been meaning to have sex with mum; I'm glad you've got her as a daughter. I'm not the greedy whore who would go for a mother." I had only just caught that thought in the past.</p> <p>This revelation came from an unspoken question, one that both my dad and I had been wondering about for some time, but we hadn't said it yet. But before the opportunity to reveal to my family who my dad and I really were, I had to admit it, that I was very sexually attracted to my dad. I had always known our relationship as a sexual relationship to begin with but there had never been any mention in any way about the sex between our parents, especially never about it being a 'faggy/filthy' affair. I had decided to open up to him as I had often said, 'I'm open for your use, dad.' The moment I had asked him about it, I had told him, 'It's my duty at the end of all of this - I get to be honest with you.' And now my dad had told me this - it was a question.</p> <p>I had always wondered if I had to be honest with him. It was a big hurdle that was still too much for me to broach to my mum. My dad had told me, "No man in the world could ever tell, and not just to mum! I couldn't help that you and mum were both so similar."</p> <p>Well, I thought, it wouldn't make a difference. To make a change of topic I had said, "Your first time with your mum, I want you to do something for me. Are you interested?"</p> <p>To my surprise, he replied that the sex between me and mum was going to be something for me, as well. He didn't say exactly what was going to happen - just that he said he was open to something. He wouldn't give me any details, but it was clear that he was talking about his relationship with mum as part of sex, and sex was just part of the relationship. He said he would try to bring me out of my shell - and he wanted to be sure - before we ever had sex.</p> <p>My father then left off with a parting shot, and said, "I'll be in touch with you soon."</p> <p>Just a little over an hour later, I had come home late, on top of what was on tap for me. My dad had obviously been in bed with mum for some time, but mum was not in the room. In the way it was, it seemed like a lot of time had gone by without her saying a word. The time for all that passion seemed short, I had thought, and now the time had come.</p> <p>All this being so sexually charged the next two days, with our thoughts on sexual encounters with dad, I had a little orgasm at every moment when I did think of him. I couldn't help but wonder what it must feel like to have a man's cock in me: his in my pussy, his in my ass. I knew what I wanted to feel and what I need to feel: a hard thick cock in my pussy, his in my ass, his in my mouth, his in my mouth...</p> <p>One morning when I was taking a shower, I was in a very naughty mood: I was very horny... and I couldn't help myself! What I was doing, what happened in class... it all had started at the beginning of our last day of school. That day, a week of summer school holidays, I was over, we had finished it all. There is going to the university. I was on the last day we had a day. We started. I walked to the day that day of school, there was to be on a schoolâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
