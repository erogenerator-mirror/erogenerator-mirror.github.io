New York on a</strong> Sunday morning on a weekday was a nice place to have a good, early morning fuck. That's what I was doing when this morning rolled around and I saw in her a woman who knew what she wanted and wanted it. She looked over herself, gave me a sexy smile, and rolled over on her back. "Wake me up again, you bastard! I want another big load!" She pouted and then she took a deep moan.</p> <p>"Agh..." was my only defense. Of course, I could feel the semen seeping out from her slit. She'd never gotten pregnant. Well, except for that one time, when she was in the bathroom. But now she was just being a nice, sexy lady. I could feel my knob soften even with the way it had softened, or maybe it was just that Eros made sure his eggs were potent, and his piggies were all potent. That's what he did. Weakened eggs.</p> <p>And then she stretched out her arms and laughed.</p> <p>"Why're your hands still tied," I asked. That was a question I would never have expected to ask. What was I doing? I'd gotten a pretty good fucking this morning. I was in for another morning.</p> <p>"What?" She gave me an inquisitive look. "Do you want to finish?"</p> <p>"Nah I'll do it. I just think it needs to be washed."</p> <p>She lay there, and we watched the light go out. It didn't matter that we were already late from our appointment. I was thinking about that beautiful face I'd seen all those times I'd dreamed of having a face that made my knob soften. That mouth that felt so good. I couldn't think about anything else.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"God, the way your tits are hanging," I murmured as I started to remove my hands. For the first time in several days I really felt the need to wash my hands. I turned around to face her while she was still laying on her belly and then started to run my hands over her chest. She was no longer lying on her back, but on her stomach instead. She started to wiggle her butt in that way I love to do when I see a nicely-shaped bubble butt. It was not a nice-sized bubble butt but, rather, a perfectly rounded round ass that had been lovingly rubbed and squeezed with love and affection.</p> <p>"You're kidding, aren't you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I know. I know. I just couldn't help wondering how nice this woman's ass would feel. Not a single bit of it, and that's just the way I feel, but it is perfect as a butt," I said. "I just didn't know where the soap needed to go."</p> <p>As if to reinforce what I knew I'd say next, I leaned down and started to lather her butt with the soap.</p> <p>"Ohhh, that feels so nice!" She was looking over her shoulder at me. "Come on, get up and scrub my back. That's it, oh yeah, right there. Soooooooooo..."</p> <p>"Sorry," I murmured.</p> <p>"No, it's all right. You just get back up on your knees."</p> <p>After my last little soap job, I rinsed the soap in my hand and ran it in between her buttcheeks. And then I reached around her until I felt the tip of her clit. I didn't make more contact that I had yesterday.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels weird..."</p> <p>"That's just it. You feel right, I know," I said as I licked at the wetness on her pussy lips. Then I ran my tongue up and down her slit. When her butt got wet enough, I sucked her clit into my mouth and gave it a firm nudge with my tongue. "Ohhh, that's, um, wonderful."</p> <p>"So it's okay if I cum," she asked.</p> <p>"Uh, sure. Don't push it. I'll take care of it. How about if I come too?"</p> <p>A thought crossed her head. "Do you like it?"</p> <p>I smiled. "Yes, do it!"</p> <p>But then she surprised me again. "Do it...I was hoping I'd get this." She reached for her toy and her fingertips went between her asscheeks to rub against my knob.</p> <p>That's when I really came.</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything. Just let me help you," she said, and then she reached forn I'd. And she'd push my knob with a good hands, and a good.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Yes, it's OK, just let's what's good</p> <p></p> <p>The good—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
