See vol. iv. p. 382.] MADEMOISELLE,—My friends know that,</strong> dear readers, that I have been married, and that my wife is no longer the love of my life—as I had always hoped—and that I will have to die, even if it meant my being able to have a heart attack or an accident—or if I'll have to be cremated. For that, your support is invaluable. And I promise that I shall never, ever forget to return to the States, at any reasonable point in time, and return the key to the original and to the family tree, and to find that, through my gravely influence, I shall always be the family history—the family of Mademona, a great nation blessed with the most beautiful family in the entire country. Your applause is all for me, folks. "</p> <p>*</p> <p>When I awoke that Monday morning, it was early. It was a dark and quiet world, with nothing but our two great families. We weren't in the front room of my hotel, nor did I hear the pounding of our heart when I realized that one of my colleagues had awakened to the sound of my bedroom door slamming shut.</p> <p>But, fortunately, it didn't mean I wasn't still lying there naked and sound asleep, right in the middle of the first floor.</p> <p>At that moment, I heard the key in the lock as I lay in bed that previous night. And now, just like the night before, I was in bed. And the key was still there when I got up.</p> <p>With my eyes closed, I drifted off into a nice, pleasant sleep.</p> <p>As I lay there, thinking about what I'd heard at college in the back of the dorm room, I felt the softest touch of her beautiful body against mine.</p> <p>My dream world was complete.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>I woke with the feel of her breasts pressing hard into my bare chest, and my morning hard-on rising between us.</p> <p>I was lying naked with a naked and warm, soft body pressed flat to mine, and her leg was pressing along with mine, and as I closed my eyes and surrendered to her, I felt her hands on top of my face, running through my hair, and her body against me.</p> <p>I looked over to the clock in my room and noticed it was noon and we had a long hour before the train pulled back to make its way into L.A.</p> <p>As I woke, I could feel her lips pressed hard against mine, and she moaned as she kissed me tenderly.</p> <p>"Good morning, sleepyhead.," she whispered and I could only smile, and then kissed her again.</p> <p>"Mmm," she gasped, and then kissed me again.</p> <p>We moved around so my back was propped against her, and she pressed her body hard against mine. And as I slipped my hands under her back, I felt her soft breasts and hard nipples pressing into my chest, and then I felt her slide her body up mine as she kissed down my body. With my hands still gently squeezing her ass cheeks, her kisses found their way down past my stomach to my groin, where she began kissing me again and slipping her tongue into my crotch.</p> <p>I reached my hands down to the cheeks of her ass, and I took her hard and firm tits in my hands and gently stroked and caressed them.</p> <p>"Mmm," she hissed again as I felt her warm tongue on my cock. "So good!"</p> <p>Her lips slid down to the base of my cock as she sucked on the head, which felt as good as it must have looked. And as her lips slid down to taste my pre-come already oozing from the tip of my dick for the first time, I could feel my knees start to buckle.</p> <p>I pushed myself up on all fours and rolled over so she could lie between my legs again. She took my cock in her hand and began sucking on it.</p> <p>Then she rose up on her elbow and moved down so her face was against my stomach while she squeezed my balls. "You're ready to have your cock sucked, aren't you," she said, and she took me back into her mouth and licked the shaft and the tip of my cock, and then she began licking up and down my penis again.</p> <p>Her tongue swirled over my cockhead as she sucked, and she would sometimes slip her tongue inside my cock. Sometimes she would put her lips around the very head and suck it between her lips hard, and I felt as her tongue slipped in my slit between her lips.</p> <p></p> <p>I could feel her warm mouth on my cock and her tongue on my balls, now, and her lips and all around and my balls. I could feel her fingers. Her warm and everything we had been the feeling all the soft and everywhere. And everything and everything.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And in this was ahhh—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
