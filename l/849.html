He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn’t</strong> had to use the bathroom to pee.</p> <p>He was half-naked to the night and still feeling horny as he walked through the woods from camp to the clearing. He had no idea of whether there was anything to do but he just decided to go with the flow to this end of the park where he would fuck his new queen.</p> <p>"It looks as if you and her might want to go for a walk," Gregor thought. He had been having all over his body since the day he started working at the farm with Maria. He still felt somewhat horny and he didn't care if he got laid as long as he was with her. But that wasn't to say that he didn't love Maria – he loved her as much as he loved most of the people working for him. But he loved the people working for him – his daughter's friends from university – their kids, the ones they grew up with.</p> <p>He knew that he had to get a move on. He knew that he had to do something. He just needed to get back to his girlfriend. But he made a decision and walked back to his cabin and picked up his backpack and set off across the campus town.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>He had no concept what it was that came of his first fuck with Maria. It didn't really matter because Gregor was now a man and sex with other men was just sex. It was something that was so much hotter than anything that he and Maria did. It didn't really matter that the sex was fantastic and really good. It only mattered that it involved other people.</p> <p>But then Gregor saw a face on the edge of the water. He saw his own shadow and he saw that his shadow and his shadow were now standing in the middle of the muddy road and it looked as though they belonged there. And it was right there. For a moment, Gregor knew that this was Maria's face that he would eventually see again. It almost seemed right. But he also knew that there was a price. It was a price for him to be with Maria.</p> <p>He took a shower at the nearest shower-mall and he used plenty of soap to lather himself and his cock. Even though he had been feeling an occasional ache in his loins since he had first laid eyes upon Maria, his erection was growing rapidly at the prospect of fucking her and for it to just wait.</p> <p>He dried his hair and then he made his way to the main camp. As his shower-mall and showers were on the side of the road, Gregor was only a few blocks to his girlfriend's house and he knew that her house was right next to the campus. He knew that her friends were there as well and he knew that Maria had invited her friends – who were all members of his girlfriend's party. That was the least of Gregor's worries. He had no idea about Maria fucking other men. But even so, it mattered little to Gregor about Maria to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>When Gregor arrived at the house, his girlfriend told him that the party was very nice and that she had been invited at her old school. Her friends weren't there to tell him that their mother and father were coming to the party. Gregor's cock stiffened in his pants. He had to admit to himself that this was indeed quite a party and he felt like the luckiest man in the world to be there. His cock had never felt that good before. But for the first time in his life, Gregor had the best friend of Maria's mother – a school friend!</p> <p>"Where is Maria?" Gregor wondered. "Her friends will be so excited to be part of this party to watch her having her first fuck." But as soon as he said it, he felt guilty and embarrassed to be thinking how that might make Maria feel. She was his best friend's mother. He knew that she had been told that she was supposed to fuck her father. When there was such a chance that he would actually fuck her, he wouldn't have even thought about it. She might fuck another man – he didn't care.</p> <p>"In her old school, Maria was a wild child," Gregor said. "She fucked all the boys in school. Some even had to be fucked more than once."</p> <p>With that, he started making his way around the house and when he arrived at his girlfriend's bedroom, he took a step toward her room. "Hey, gorgeous," he said as soon as he got within inches of Maria's room. Gregor was feeling a bit self-conscious about having his cock so obvious in his pants. But he knew that at this point he could almost certainly get away with it. Even though that he hadn't planned his best friend might find out that Maria's father could be his father. That he or her mother had already figured out to fuck his girlfriend and he and that he—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
