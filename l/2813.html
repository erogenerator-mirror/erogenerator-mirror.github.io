For where a man seeth another worshipped he supposeth him powerfull, and is the readier to obey him; which makes his Power</strong> and powerfull to fuck. And so when time to fuck had its course, the time to fuck the woman in heaven, was gone in what used to be a long, tedious time, and only the end of a day comes along. The word of the man's life seemed far away. Sometimes he was called upon to fuck some of the women he liked. Sometimes he was called upon to fuck the women he hated. Sometimes he was called upon to fuck the women he loved. Occasionally he was called upon to fuck a lot of women he hated.</p> <p>Many times in his past, he could not quite keep his hands off women. After all, if he had sex with any of the women of his choice, she would be his equal. But sometimes with some women, he did love an orgy. A lot of them loved him, just as they were looking forward to bedding him. At the end of each one of a dozen or so fuckings with some woman, he came to love the thought of some woman he loved as much as he loved the woman he was looking forward to fucking. And so, as he started his second month of school, he took that first step to the end of his sexual relations with a woman in their right mind, just as everyone of his classes would have.</p> <p>When he first came to the university he had to study to make a point to get into the right path. He had to study to learn what was happening at the right time—or to stop it to the last word.</p> <p>He wanted to find women he knew sexually. But sometimes he was too stupid to even grasp the concept that women didn't want to marry him. And he figured it didn't matter that they knew he's a man, so long as they were willing and able to fulfill his needs. And he couldn't bring himself to look at himself in the mirror in front of him.</p> <p>And still when he came to his studies in human psychology, it didn't matter how much he wanted different things from the women of his past, because even if he got those things from women who weren't interested, that was his problem. He could simply make some of them. He could just make them more womanly.</p> <p>And then there were the special occasions he could make a special effort to make someone to be less and less important to him. First, he could make all of them beautiful. So he could show some how and what a man should feel about women's bodies and be more meaningful to that. What he would like to do to them, he could do to them. And just because he could do that and make them more beautiful, and be more passionate about them, he could make them feel more precious to him.</p> <p>He loved making them happy, and they were happy. Why wouldn't he? Well, at least to some of them.</p> <p>And the man of the moment should never have to be in love. But the man should never have to be in love. Or in lusting after someone because the other man was too important for that man. And there is one thing wrong with that, and if you have any idea as to what it is—if he has to look down on any woman who can make his fantasies come true—his own fantasies should be his own.</p> <p>I know it's been hard to find women I love because I have to be sure. I guess that's part of why I don't have any of them. But when most men know what they would like, and if they are honest and do what they want, there shouldn't be any confusion about what they do.</p> <p>I can't get the man of the moment to tell these silly stories for me. He can't get the woman to tell him they want him to fuck them and love them enough that they would stop if asked. So as he says, he must tell the truth and not just some dumb thing to get women to fuck him in his fantasies. He must have a better way of telling these fairy tales than to make all the real-life fairy tales. And maybe, if I have to give them a good show, I can do something about it.</p> <p>What was his favorite?</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>"Are you coming out to your parents today?"</p> <p>He was coming out to his parents today. He had to have to have his mother all day to meet all the people at his college, and his grandmother had to have a lot of things for her and her son after all. What can someone as stupid as him do about a day to day job?</p> <p>The day would start with all of the usual things a good guy should do, but never do anyway. And then his mother, the day would start by his mother, she would start off the way down on the day after he would start. He would start, the way down with him.
