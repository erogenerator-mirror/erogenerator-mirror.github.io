The natural properties, and privileges of a reasonable soul are: That</h4><p><strong>she seeth herself; that she can order, and compose herself: that she makes herself as she will herself: that she reaps her own fruits whatsoever, whereas plants, trees, unreasonable creatures,</strong> do like to play games as they will.</p> <p>Then we entered the tent; she was sitting cross-legged, with a towel over her head. She was wearing long-sleeved pyjamas, made of silk fabric. She was not looking right at him as her eyes were closed, like she knew he knew the effect she was having. My cock stiffened, aching at her thought, as I imagined her lying naked on her bed in all of her glory, and that he had his cock in her mouth, feeling and pleasuring it: and that he was going to have his way with her. He would be taking his clothes off.</p> <p>I closed the tent door behind me, and entered the room. She was still asleep, and did not wake up when I got on top of her, my body pressed into hers, my cock on her pussy lips, my stomach on top of hers, her legs parted, and mine on top of hers: her own naked body in full enjoyment and full possession of mine. I took her wrists and placed her hands behind my head, in a position of mutual embrace and embrace.</p> <p>As I lifted her onto the bed and mounted her, my rigid cock, already slick with her juices, penetrated her pussy in one stroke, making her gasp with pleasure.

She begged for more, with her hands on my back, on my butt and on my waist, holding me in her as firmly as possible.</p> <p>I started to cum and I held her down as she came with me, and had an orgasm and a very full release of my own cum in that moment, feeling her own orgasm in her pussy, feeling her orgasm in me as an orgasm that triggered mine, and having her cum as I felt my own cum shooting into her welcoming body.</p> <p>It was my second time, and I lost contact as I slipped out of her, but remained near her as I felt my softening cock go down, coming to rest on her stomach, her belly that had not been fucked so, but in a position of its own.</p> <p>We lay quietly for a while, looking at each other, trying to get a sense for the fact that the previous night had not meant anything to me. At last I spoke.</p> <p>"That was beautiful," I said: "but the next was even better! Now do you find it beautiful enough to get you into?"</p> <p>She smiled that wicked smile.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said: "You're beautiful!"</p> <p>And that was the first night that we were in the bed after our first fuck, and that has been another chapter of our friendship, a new chapter for usâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
