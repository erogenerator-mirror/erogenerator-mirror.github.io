This entrance, which usually stood ajar in the most inviting</strong> places, was now blocked by the same heavy door, with its steel rim closed behind him. Only the dim lights of Paris and London would light the way without any other windows, so the walls were covered in dark blue-walled curtains with the exception of one. He hesitated and looked around. The only visible window was one far wall, and he could always just see it through those curtains. Perhaps his imagination worked wrong but, as he had hoped, so must this old door.</p> <p>As he reached across the thin wall to open the door, he felt a hand rest against his shoulder and gently stroke his hair. The feeling was electric as it seemed to linger around his shoulder as he leaned back into his mistress. The touch was not hard, as he had expected, but it was electrifying and it made him moan softly. This felt so delicious! But, he knew why she would have to go to Paris and this was only the first step. This had only been a matter of seconds before this was going to be his last chance to ever have sex with a woman.</p> <p>'Just as you thought your last trip to Paris was an invitation for my cock to fuck your juicy young cunt, this was my last chance to fuck you,' she whispered, but he was too lost in the soft perfume of her and the soft caresses of her fingers as she caressed his hair.</p> <p>'Your cock is going to fuck me in the morning, my little boy, but only after you fuck me in the morning,' she giggled.</p> <p>'If I do, can I lick your pussy?'</p> <p>'Oh I'm not sure but I'm sure you could arrange for it later, if you'd prefer, but for now, just let's have breakfast in the morning.'</p> <p>And, with that she turned away from the wall and got into the car. Her skirt rose up around her waist as she leaned over and opened the window. A pair of red silk stockings was held up and clipped around her thighs, and she slid her stockings across her legs to get them in place in a straight line before she turned towards the next street to turn left. His cock was achingly hard by the time he got in the car.</p> <p>It took only two minutes until they stopped at the restaurant they were in. It was an old traditional restaurant built in the 1950's when the restaurant had a traditional name such as 'Number 43 Rue Petit-Picpus'. The tables in the restaurant were set up much like the one now in Number 63, but there was also a separate dining room for the staff and a bathroom for guests. This room was empty save for the table of guests who knew there to be no customers, only visitors and waiters. A waiter, who could not be seen serving the usual buffet, greeted them, a bottle of wine opened in front of him and a plate of food in front of him, which he knew was only his mistress' delicious pussy before she disappeared into the bathroom. He wanted to be able to wait for her to return and eat. His cock was throbbing between his legs again as he sat the chair back and ate his food. When he finished he drank his wine, which only made him thirsty even more. The waiter had left with their order and he quickly paid the bill and went back to his seat, watching the others eating his food. For the next half hour he drank wine in the restaurant and had his coffee. He was very aware in his mind that all the others were watching but he could not make out what they were saying. At one point he tried to glance at his watch. It was 9.25. As they finished eating, his mistress came back into the restaurant carrying a piece of meat.</p> <p>'I knew you loved to eat alone. I just hope you want to wait for your mistress in the bathroom before you fuck her,' she said smiling.</p> <p>'Of course I do! Thank you Mistress,' he said, smiling. His lips had the effect of making a sexy pouting of their white colour.</p> <p>She put the meat on a tray in front of him and sat down on one of the low tables in the dining room. She gave him a small smile and said, 'How do you want to eat?'</p> <p>'Where you do the dishes mistress? I want to be able to eat here as I watch the others,' he replied.</p> <p>'Well, you may just have to take care of the other things, my boy. If you're good,' she warned.</p> <p>As he walked behind her table, her eyes followed him. She had a sexy smile on her face as she said, 'No! I want a little more. I want your cock. ' that you to fuck my ass. it later.'. as I want another cock to fuck it,' as I say. of yours!' I want to fuck my ass. when you in Paris, as I do—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
