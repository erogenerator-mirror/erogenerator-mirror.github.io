Not as though thou hadst thousands of years to live. Death hangs</h4><p><strong>over thee: whilst yet thou livest, whilst thou mayest, be good.</strong> Be very good!</p> <p>A woman in a woman's clothes, dressed up as a girl, sitting down at the same time a man's lap. A man's eyes, a woman's hand, a man's hand, a mother's hand. A woman in a girl's clothes, dressing up as a girl. A female in a boy's clothing, doing girls' doers' dances. A male in a woman's clothes, showing the world he's a man.</p> <p>Some say, it is an act of magic, an act of love. A lady must be magical when she sings. And with women, as a girl, she must be magical to sing. Perhaps a woman can even sing quite well when singing her own pretty tune. A guy may even learn something he needs to read, before he can do anything.</p> <p>With a man's leg crossed behind her back and his hard hand resting on her knee, a woman's mouth and her body can be sexy too. If she was wearing any panties, she'd be very happy to have him rub her and touch her and play with her. And her breasts could be very sexy too. If she were to sit on his lap facing him, he might get to fondle her breasts and pinch her nipples. And, with her sitting on his lap, he'd be able to lick her pussy and his ass. If she were wearing panties, she, too, might have her legs open, for him, as he might kiss her while he fingered her, or he would take his own cock out. If she were wearing panties, he might just take them off. Then she'd be his wife, his mother, his lover, and his slut.</p> <p>A couple can be more than friends.</p> <p>Some say, the spell is just a simple one. Perhaps one-time only, so long as it comes on the basis of magic and the spell is very real, the spell is not made up of any type. A girl can't know the spell is real. There are some people who swear that the spell is real, no, but they never show the kindling on the stove to verify the spell. A guy could swear, for he'd be willing to risk another spell, if he were the man of the house.</p> <p>A woman can be magical too.</p> <p>A boy can be magical.</p> <p>If two people were in this position, a boy would probably be very happy to have one of his male friends rub his cock while he watched a female body be played with.</p> <p>A guy would be very happy.</p> <p>If being a man of the house is real, he'd love to be a female sex toy and be allowed in to play with her, as she sat on him and rubbed herself against him while he finger fucked her pussy. This would be a lot to take in, especially with two boys sitting there and enjoying the show, and watching the show, together. If we have magic, one of us is sure to be magical enough to make two males want to have sex with their female friend. The thought and the idea that two males would be a group of women, enjoying sex with each other has a very powerful and sexy, magical presence.</p> <p>Yet, just to be on the safe side, just to be safe, one can't be, is as far as one is prepared, to just try being magical at least once, while making one of the people, who are just sitting there, wonder what they are doing. A man can't be magic.</p> <p>If you think a man is being magical is a man being sexy and appealing to people, well, don't wait so long before jumping up and telling your friends, that your friend's boyfriend got to jerk off while he got to finger her wet pussy. If your friend got to finger herself while looking for a boy to give her a hand job, he might just go over the edge and cum in this woman's mouth. If they weren't already a couple, they'd find a way to be friends, like mother and daughter, even if they weren't already a couple.</p> <p>If you find one of a couple, or both, just as hot and sexy as the other, being magical is just as sexy. Being magical will have it's own magic, too, while being sex toys is a nice bonus.</p> <p>A lot of people find magical, being magical to the point where a girl has a magical penis, doesn't make any sense to you, because the magic doesn't seem to be enough to convince you that it is magical. Some people do believe in the magic of being magical as a sort of power, or power of the power to be used in other ways. Others, like me, can just use magic as well, as it appears to be magic in their magic as magic by being used on other.</p> <p>to them, say, as magical being magical sex toys in to be toys for their own a toyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
