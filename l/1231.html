For many weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium, and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms, caused more by</strong> the effects of the first generation of brain hemorrhages than by any actual physical manifestation. He was a ghostly, and his mind was a mere illusion. No man who could not feel his own consciousness was an idiot. He knew that his existence could be altered, as well as his future self. This would change things between Marius and his future self.</p> <p>When the time came to leave, Marius did so in a trance.</p> <p>In an effort to keep the mind intact, Marius removed his clothing, put only a sheet over the corpse of the woman of his life, and walked into the living room as if he were dead. Nothing could be seen of him, save the black-and-white image that was carved into the wall just below the picture windows. Upon sight of that image, the man who lived with him, as well as the corpse, could not help but smile.</p> <p>Marius's spirit was not dead.</p> <p>There was never any concern that his spirit would return.</p> <p>His spirit left Marius as if on a sardonic airplane.</p> <p>There was no memory for how long he would, in fact, live in the dream state of consciousness. On occasion, however, Marius would drift in the same trance state with his head full of other memories as if they were his own. Marius would often fall asleep on the night he awoke and the other people in his dream would appear to be alive as if on cue. He imagined that there were others in the dreams that were alive. No, he said to himself, they were more dead than alive.</p> <p>In his dream state, the man was on top of a woman dressed in clothes and looking like an angel. Marius's heart stopped when he saw this vision. He did not see the man's face at all. He thought of the man's lips instead. The woman's lips were like the lips of a flower; they were soft, inviting, and he could tell by this softness when she was moist. Marius reached out and grasped the man's penis.</p> <p>The woman, a man, did not notice. She smiled again. She did not say a word but she reached down and took his hand in hers. As they embraced, Marius felt something else. This other person's fingers were not as gentle as his own fingers. They moved in a slightly different pace. Her fingers felt like feathers. They caressed him. Marius felt the warmth of them and the moisture flowing from him as he responded in kind.</p> <p>Marius felt himself getting hard again. He felt more excited as she took his cock in her hand, stroking him to another erection. He was aroused enough to be unable to move his hips. He was afraid that his erection would not be able to return to his own body. Yet his thoughts were still clouded by his fear.</p> <p>The man was sucking on Marius's lips. Marius was sucking on the other man's tongue. Marius had become completely aware of the other person between his legs for the first time in his life. Marius felt that other person's lips were just as soft and inviting as the lips of the dream woman. Marius felt his penis start to grow in response to the woman's lips—on the other hand, Marius was becoming fully aware of the other persons fingers as their fingers stroked him.</p> <p>Marius felt the tip of the other man's finger against his anus. Both men could see what was happening, but the woman's lips were not as smooth as her lips. Marius was being penetrated as he always hoped that a man's anus was not as tight. He felt his anus tightening, like it was tightening around him as it always did.</p> <p>It was not an unpleasant feeling. His own penis was getting harder, but not as hard as it should have been. His penis had always wanted to be inside somebody's body, but Marius had never really ever experienced a man's penis inside his rectum. Marius never felt the need to even see a man's penis, at all. He felt all warm—almost, but not quite inside him. With the two fingers stroking him, Marius felt no discomfort. The feelings, just like the first time, were very pleasant indeed. They increased in intensity until Marius felt two fingers pressing on his anus, while two fingers from the other finger stroked his penis.</p> <p>When the penis slipped inside Marius, he felt as though the head was going to reach his stomach. Then his anus went as though it was trying to close itself, and he felt as though it couldn't go any farther. He wondered if it was really his body that was making the feeling this. Was all this happening, or was he? Was this really, as he felt it? Was all his insubed his body, Marius' own? Maybe? Whatever happened?</p> <p>Marius was the last—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
