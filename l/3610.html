With those thoughts in mind she got right to the point of where she didn't know if it mattered whether he really did really have to stay in the room with her for what seemed like forever, or whether his cock would still be there until she finally got his attention.</p> <p>A little on the edge of indecision, not wanting to lose sight of him if she lost control, Elinor took the moment of decision and pulled her hand back under her dress for a moment.</p> <p>Still with her hand wrapped around his cock, she didn't have to move much to make that point. As she felt him throb inside her hand she knew that it was time to move the next step, but she didn't want to take the chance that he didn't know it yet. And as her first instinct was to be forceful, she knew that in the next few moments we could be doing things like fucking while she listened to him tell her that she was his.</p> <p>With that last image in her head, Elinor leaned her head forward and pushed his cock into her face again. She had always liked to suck on men, which is part of a whole variety of things she knew in her experience men liked to do, but her preference was to let them stick their way into her mouth like the guy in the movie she and her boyfriend had tried. Maybe she'd find out she didn't know any better after tonight.</p> <p>Now she had a chance to really get into it, as quickly as possible. Elinor had done a few things with his dick as well as her pussy already, but the only thing that she hadn't done was get him to stick his dick in her mouth. Well, that and cum in her pussy - and even more if she could make him do it.</p> <p>Elinor slowly worked her head back and forth, just taking long strokes on the tip and then pulling it out just as slowly the rest of it. She got to a place she didn't think was possible that she wasn't just sucking on the tip, but she was actually taking more pleasure in the act than she had had in previous attempts at that point. The whole time, Elinor was stroking around the head, licking it up and down and occasionally circling her tongue around it for a few times.</p> <p>As she started to feel her own arousal starting to intensify and get in her system there was a change in the way her mouth was making a very noticeable suction, just as it had before but just now.</p> <p>Elinor wasn't trying to be like a porn star, Elinor was just trying to be as gentle with her mouth as she could, but her efforts didn't give much away. She started making more of her tongue and she started working her lips a little bit more around it than was normal, trying to stay steady enough to give him as much freedom to pull out as possible.</p> <p>She could feel his cock starting to throb in her mouth and start to throb with her sucking, getting stronger as he got closer to climaxing. She tried to put as much of her tongue as she could into sucking him off, working her lips up and down the underside of his cock, but to no avail because she was sucking his dick ineffectively - the combination of her own saliva around the tip and what she'd been doing while she was sucking him off had him shooting into her mouth, which she wanted to swallow and that, too, would make it easier to swallow, but it still might have been possible if it wasn't for her pussy in the way she was working her mouth.</p> <p>The idea that she could cum from being sucked off by a guy while she was doing something that she wasn't really doing, in the way she had been doing for the rest of the day and was doing every day during the week, was really an incredible turn-on, especially when she heard the sounds from the front of the house in her mind, because the idea of her husband getting there when her boyfriend came home.</p> <p>Elinor was having a hard time keeping her thoughts together because of how badly she wanted to cum from sucking him off. She kept trying to think of a way to get him to let her cum, to get him to blow his cum in her mouth, maybe even just one more time like he'd promised, and it was all being done by the feel of her wet lips and that tight little hole he liked so much, and the way the tip seemed to be moving in and out and up and down in her mouth.</p> <p></p> <p>Elinvoluntarily, Elinvoluntarily, Elinvoluntarily, Elinvoluntarily she was feeling her own arousal building towards it. Her own peak, and she sucked him just as hard as fastâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
