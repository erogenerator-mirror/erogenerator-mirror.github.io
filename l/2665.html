The word applies to that moment of the month in terms to a date.</p> <p>It's difficult to describe how hard it was. When that moment of lust was presented, and every cell in my being was pulsing with the beat of an electronic heart.</p> <p>The first part of the ritual was repeated with the second part with the third part, "the third part of the same ritual" repeating itself for a while, but this time it repeated itself for two hours. Each time that ritual was repeated, I would get the chance of kissing the person with whom it was repeated before the final part was over.</p> <p>I was still holding my robe closed, and when it fell open I had an instant erection. It was not going to be a very comfortable evening.</p> <p>Since no one could see into my room, and no one else in the house could see into my room I turned on lights, which were not always installed, and set up candles around the living room, dining table, the floor in our backyard, and the patio furniture. Then we were ready.</p> <p>The two hours were passed in slow motion, my hand on the breast of my date, and my lover, his hand stroking my nipples while I masturbated.</p> <p>The moment was complete when I heard my first words, "Hello."</p> <p>I had already started, that day and only a bit less. I wanted to tell him that he had brought me home, but he was already moving down the hallway.</p> <p>I stopped him and told him that I had come here to take some more pictures and to get a couple dozen new ones. I turned him away from the camera, and made him stand in front of it. When I opened the camera case, I took the camera in his hand, and took three photos. Then I turned to the person with whom I was going to kiss. I wanted to kiss him for how he had been the first time I had kissed him on my birthday.</p> <p>I bent for the kiss again, and he kissed me. There was never anything more special in giving kisses or receiving kisses. Just as my mouth went into his mouth I kissed for my first time. I was ready to take him and kiss for my first time and let him take me. After the kiss, I pushed his head down to my breast, and he sucked on my nipple.</p> <p>If I had not known that I wanted him to suck on my nipples I would have told him to go to my bed and suck my nipples. I would have told him that it was not going to be an easy experience, that I had not wanted that to ever happen.</p> <p>I stopped him and told him that my panties would get pushed all the way down in the floor before he arrived home.</p> <p>"Please no. I want to do that right here" he told me. "It's okay, go ahead, I just like going down on you" I told him.</p> <p>He smiled, reached to remove the panties he had pulled out of place, and said, "Just take the fucking panties off here."</p> <p>He had left them in my lingerie on the dining table, he would pick them up as soon as he got home. I handed them to him and I felt him place them in his pocket.</p> <p>I had never done this before, and never thought I would ever do it before. I was nervous. I was always nervous. I wanted to do this.</p> <p>But he had already turned away from me, and I took his place.</p> <p>I kissed just the tip of his nose as I took his erection in hand. His softness was very arousing, and as I rubbed the head of his penis with my tongue my hands trembled as I started to slide my hands up and down the shaft of his penis.</p> <p>When I felt his penis get harder I started to give more kisses over to his scrotum, and when he tried to push my head down to his penis I said, "Not yet. That's nice"</p> <p>I got to my knees on the patio furniture and kneeled down. I wanted to suck him. When I bent to suck his penis I looked at him. He was watching me with a smile as I put his cock back in my mouth, and I sucked on it for a long time.</p> <p>Then I felt a finger on my penis. I looked down. It had just gone through the moist crack of my asshole. I pushed the finger against it. It rubbed my prostate. I put my hand around the shaft of his penis and I sucked on the head.</p> <p>"Let's get this over with" I told him.</p> <p>I was sure that I could not just blow on my mouth before he entered me. But I wanted to feel what he was in my mouth. He was in my mouth. was in my mouth. "my mouth". a moment was in my mouth.
