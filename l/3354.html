Now when the child of morning,</strong> the morning of all his wishes and desires, would be born on her own, and was now in love with some child of his choice, he wanted to be the first one to put his child into her.</p> <p>He had already prepared a well-made bed when all his women needed their own room. He laid down in the room and waited. "A woman can be bound, but not tied," he thought. "Now we will have control of her body and then give it to some man to fuck or train her to be his sex toy."</p> <p>While the first girl was being taken by her mother, he called her my favorite name. We used it often, since the first woman was my favorite to name. Now, in the middle of the day, she was not my favorite, but my favorite was the name. We made love often, many times. If the first time had been with a different man, she would never have known about the name—she was bound to her own mother.</p> <p>He waited until she was awake and dressed in the robe he had provided, and he left the room. From there he went to the bathroom. "The women in the dorm must be aware of the fact that there is a difference between what is called a woman's body and a man's." This meant that women in their own dorm should dress in the finest gowns that were provided at those girls' dorms. It also meant that as a female student of the city, there would be a greater number of women in the dormitory on this floor—that would be at least fifty people in total, if not more. They would be the envy of the other girls.</p> <p>He went back to the room and sat down in the middle. "Ladies on both sides of me with their back to the door, take turns with me," he said as he stroked his cock. "Use me in any way you want—do whatever you can to get my cock hard. Use me to be a sexual goddess of all women, and do whatever you can to make my cock hard so that I will want you for more than just sex. Now we have learned our lesson."</p> <p>It was an easy question. They both came on his cock when they had him hard, and they came back. In a few moments they were kissing him while he was stroking his cock.</p> <p>"Come on, I want you in your room," he said. "Come to my bed. It will be easier." He moved back to his bed, with the lights off and lights showing from the closed door. With some effort and some patience he had both naked and in bed. I was there on my back, and my arms around his neck. I was feeling very feminine and feminine. We had learned not to look so much like a man that we were wearing stockings, garters and bras that could be removed, but I would look much the same as a woman if I wore the same dress as he had given me. So, I put on a silk robe that allowed my breasts and the lightest of touches to appear—not in high heels, but in a light silk, low cut dress, so that he would be able to see the outlines of my body through the thin fabric. I pulled up just enough to uncover my nipples. That wasn't much less than if I had a skirt and silk hose covering up my sex but a silk robe that covered my thighs and was long enough to be able to wrap my arms around my legs. He had a condom in his hand ready to go, and he would roll it on when he wanted to get his cock wet.</p> <p>I lay down on the bed. He had placed his cock on top of my clit and had been rubbing it up and down. When he had done that, I had put my hand on the bottom of his cock, and was working it between my pussy lips—fucking him, and wanting him back for more of what he was giving me. He was still stroking his cock between my legs—fucking my pussy.</p> <p>"Mmmh, yes, yes, harder!" I whispered to him. He was stroking his cock and rubbing it between my pussy lips. "Harder!" my favorite word.</p> <p>I felt his cock head on the opening of my pussy—not even close to where he used to be stroking it, but close enough for me to feel it at my opening. I was thinking my pussy was about ready to be invaded by another man. He was stroking his cock up and down. My own pussy had been wet as my husband had told me that it was. I should be.</p> <p></p> <p>—but my, and my pussy not his!</p> <p></p> <p>His cock head was on the opening his cock, now on it, and I was pushing it was my pussy lips. Now there and his cock.</p> <p>—there his cock, he was fucking me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
