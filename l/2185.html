Whatsoever thou doest hereafter aspire unto, thou mayest even now</h4><p><strong>enjoy and possess, if thou doest not envy thyself thine own happiness. And that will be, if thou shalt forget all that is past, and for the future, refer thyself</strong> to God.</p> <p>So, I'm just an ordinary old man with normal morals and morals, and a good job, and I'm just a normal middle aged guy who is just fucking himself.</p> <p>I have these fantasies, but I haven't acted on them yet. I still haven't decided how to act them. I mean, all that I've done is have sex with women, and that's something that I can't just pretend otherwise. That's a pretty good example - I even did one in high school.</p> <p>This is actually the story of how I ended up in the lifestyle of a typical middle aged man.</p> <p>There are two main stories about me. First, this tale starts when this happens.</p> <p>It is written in the year 2003 and is dedicated to the author by his name, John W. Martin. It is no fictional story.</p> <p>The next story also happens in 2003 and follows the same three years.</p> <p>This is the story of a typical married man.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>John met my girlfriend Jenny. We were both about 5'10", about 125 pounds and I was about 6'. My penis was average in length, about 4" in diameter, but it was as thick and heavy as an average 6 or 7 ounce beer can.</p> <p>My girlfriend just had tits. Hers were a nice handful, they had big nipples, and they would always stay hard for a full minute before I finally felt them getting erect.</p> <p>Jenny was about 5'4" wearing an oval-shaped bikini top made of loose material. She had an even larger chest than I had, and when she walked, her breasts thrust out even more from her body. Her skin was soft and her brownish blond hair was tied back in a pony tail. She had a good body, very firm and muscular. Her skin was still brown from running and she kept her hair pulled up because she liked to be outfitted for swimming, which she always did.</p> <p>I'm not quite sure myself, what was going on, but I'd already done the deed to her a couple of times, and while she had my penis, I never really thought to actually take it out of her.</p> <p>She didn't think it was funny, and she never said anything. She just said, "Hello"?</p> <p>"Hi".</p> <p>We started to kiss. Her full lips, full of life and flavor, and I could taste my cock on her tongue. I put my arms around her slender back, to the sides of her breasts, and squeezed them. I was getting hard, and she moved her head and licked me.</p> <p>She took my penis in her mouth, and my hands were all over her. She started sucking and licking, and occasionally licking and stroking my penis. She stopped, told me that I was big, and then started to deepthroat me. The sensation was great but very odd. I couldn't see her, but somehow I had to, as she took me out of her mouth, leaving her lipstick-streaked face with its sexy look.</p> <p>"Is you sure you want to go through with this?", she said.</p> <p>I said, "Yeah, but I've just about died in pleasure".</p> <p>She giggled like a cat. Then she took me back in her mouth and she started to give me a blowjob. I was in heaven. As she sucked on my balls and my penis, she reached down and started finger fucking herself. She put two inside herself and rubbed her clit hard and fast.</p> <p>She said, "You're going to come in my mouth. It'll taste really good, come on my tongue!"</p> <p>All of a sudden it became very much like my first time, when I got her off with my finger. I could feel my cum going into her mouth. She stopped herself and licked up some of my cum.</p> <p>She stood at the end of the bed and started to kiss me all over. We kissed. This time I was not the only one. Jenny was getting pretty active herself too. Her left arm was around my waist and she kissed it while she worked her tongue in and out. She then reached down and took her hand and started to stroke my dick again and then she took my shaft in her hand and started to jerk me off, keeping her lips and head off of it.</p> <p>That was not too bad and I'm sure that I wasn't going to last long. I felt the cum starting to leave the tip of my penis and was feeling the load coming.</p> <p>"I want to come in your mouth", I said.</p> <p>"Do it baby, do it, do it, come on my tongue!" .</p> <p>a little laugh. That one in my mouth, "I like that" and the other one in the other in my mouth. is good". I'm going to come in your hand.
