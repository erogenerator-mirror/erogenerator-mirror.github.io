There I was, in my bedroom with my wife's eyes and our two girls. I don't think there's an actress alive who wouldn't take the top hat we have for the first day of rehearsals at the studio. They're waiting to get us the first day back. I'm standing beside their feet. The first day is over.</p> <p>"Doors, please."</p> <p>"Okay, we want it slow!"</p> <p>"And it's going to be good!"</p> <p>The first man we saw in person was a movie star.</p> <p>"I'll take that top hat."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm wearing One-Way High."</p> <p>"It's a classic."</p> <p>"That's the difference between a Batman, or a Joker."</p> <p>"The one hat, my dear."</p> <p>"It's a Batman."</p> <p>"The Batman. The Batman. And the Joker. But this one?"</p> <p>"I'm wearing your Batman. This is 'Batman'. And this one is a Robin. And both are Batman."</p> <p>The top hat. Not that the Batman or Robin names were obscure, is it? But I'm wearing this one.</p> <p>"But the Batman has one of the most unique costumes I've ever seen."</p> <p>"And that's the point of this story."</p> <p>"Oh, I love you!"</p> <p>"Now what?"</p> <p>"Well, the Batman has to be famous, right?"</p> <p>I'm in the audience at this moment, but it's like a movie.</p> <p>I'm wearing this one.</p> <p>"And I'm wearing my Batman. Both are Batman. A long time ago I was Batman himself."</p> <p>"And you were Batman, too."</p> <p>"I was Batman when I was under the threat of an attack from an evil enemy. But Batman and Robin were not under my control."</p> <p>"And the Batman had the right to kill us?"</p> <p>"They were both under my protection. But the Batman wasn't as protected as I was. The Robin was protected," she said sarcastically, "so I killed him."</p> <p>The words that came out of my mouth made my blood run cold. I was sure that all the cameras were still on the whole class.</p> <p>Then I thought about the situation we were all in. They were all on me, so I'd better move and set up a camera. They had already found out where the best place to set up the camera for a shot was. But there wasn't much to set up on camera anyway. It just wasn't possible to set up a camera without some extra equipment. But it was possible that just getting a camera set up in this classroom would get you a few pictures with a very good camera. But then I had to find the best camera. I had to find this thing, the camera.</p> <p>"The Batman has too many clothes on. He has to be out of place because we all need clothes for this class!"</p> <p>"And it's also impossible to make a movie without trying. Besides, the Batman only gets dressed when he wants to. And as you all know, our teacher is just in the next class. Besides, all I have on is my Batman costume. And I'll have to take my Batman costume off for this class."</p> <p>As he said that the one word sentence and what I knew was true. "I'm wearing your Batman costume," were the last words he had said. For some reason my voice sounded more forceful this time. If you can't figure out the significance of that phrase, you can't tell me that I wasn't mistaken, or even that there was a question. But what was my confusion? I didn't know that much about the Batman. But I knew enough to figure out that the Batman wore a mask when he wasn't wearing a mask, and that mask was the one that the kids at the school wore to hide the identity of who it is that made them see the boy's head. And that mask did not hide the identity of the man's head. It looked more like a woman's head. I couldn't understand what that was at the moment, but since my mind was working so well as it was I figured it out.</p> <p>So I sat down and waited for the end of the day on camera. This was the hardest class I ever had at the school. It was also the hardest class of all times. The fact that our teacher had an office over the next week was not only annoying, it made it all the more difficult to deal with my nerves.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
