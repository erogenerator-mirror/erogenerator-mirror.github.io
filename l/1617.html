I wasn't sure why I was so insatiably aroused by this particular fuck session. I'm still having trouble recalling exactly the context of this night's events, but the story I remember reading before was certainly as clear as day as it was written—or more vividly. I was lost in the feel, and it was very pleasant but was also a very long and really painful ride—on that one glorious day. I just laid down the law of supply and demand and felt like the moment was almost as good as the whole day—or nearly so if you want to admit it. I didn't want to wait too long, so I decided to finish it off in the manner one would want another first time—the old cliché you learn with everything you know today.</p> <p>I began to wonder if the orgasm was as big as I had anticipated. Did it have a mind of it's own as the first one I experienced was probably the worst time I had ever had. I felt absolutely drained, like I had literally walked away from anything for so very long with the exception of the best fuck of Frank Churchill. I hadn't even left him for six hours straight, although that was a far cry from being satisfied for any length of time. The best sex of my life was certainly the way things seemed to work, but there was nothing quite like having a climax and being disappointed, just when you thought you were all ready to collapse. It was a glorious moment, as close to a night without Frank as my world had ever had been before. There was nothing quite quite like that, either except the sensation of having a great, fulfilling sex encounter with the man I love. At that moment, I wasn't too sure of what to think about it and maybe not. Was I sure about this fuck session? Was I right?</p> <p>Well, I was certainly right in a way.</p> <p>"Yes, my dear," I heard from behind me. "It is time to go."</p> <p>I was surprised to feel a sudden pressure on my ass cheeks. It was Frank, and he had already withdrawn his cock from my hole. I could feel his head pressing against my back door. Oh my god! It was his cock!</p> <p>"Just relax," he whispered. "You'll love it!"</p> <p>"Oh, god," I moaned out aloud.</p> <p>I felt his hands press me down into the desk back again. He pressed me in the back with his hands until I was resting on my knees and elbows, and then quickly slipped his cock back into place. He began to ease himself inside, slowly and gently, so I could feel its heat and weight. The pleasure was so fantastic I didn't even know I was making all kinds of noise or gasping. All I could really do was be totally satisfied, which I guess is how Frank became the best fuck of my life. He began to slowly slide his cock in and out of me, making me moan at his slow and gradual advance. I didn't even think I wanted him to speed up—I just wanted his cock to be buried to the balls and completely stuffed. All the while, I was looking straight ahead with my eyes closed, enjoying every minute of it. When it seemed like a long, beautiful pleasure, I felt another cock in my ass; both of them were now hard. I didn't care if I was being violated in the first or second by their hard cocks. I couldn't care that, it was just the kind of pleasure I enjoyed each time. Just the act of penetration was enough to fully enjoy my sexual pleasure. I also had no desire to move around on the desk or bend over, so he moved me onto him. But then he seemed to have the other cock in his hands, because he slid it in front of me and began to stroke me with it. He was taking over my ass as my boyfriend was fucking me.</p> <p>I was loving that I was being fucked. I mean, I knew it didn't feel as great as my first time did, but it was definitely the best way that I could be enjoying all of this.</p> <p>Frank began to really fuck my ass, using long, deep strokes that he didn't think I would get comfortable with. I could feel myself being stretched, but he didn't seem to care about my discomfort or discomforting herself when he pounded my ass. He just continued pulling and pushing on my ass as he fucked me as if I was still his little sister.</p> <p>I couldn't really tell exactly what he was doing with that cock, because it would just be the speed and movement of his cock. I didn't really know, but I thought it was almost a bit better than my first time. It was a little deeper but not like the first time; it was just felt different; it was just being the only a little different. Just a little more, not in.
