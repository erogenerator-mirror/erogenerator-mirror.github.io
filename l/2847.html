"The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters." Here if by the Spirit of God be meant God himself, then is Motion attributed to</strong> God.</p> <p>Paul was working on his fourth beer and had been drinking for the past few hours. He had been working hard for a while now and knew he could not get anything done. He was just going to go home and let his mind wander to all the things that had been missing from his life in the past.</p> <p>Paul walked to the end of the bar and leaned over to make sure it was empty. It was empty, but he was not sure why. He looked at the place where most people worked and there were people still sitting at tables. He liked this place and he wanted to look around. He knew that this was where he would fuck and be fucked and have sex. There were so many people in this place and he knew that he would have sex many times over the next few weeks. Paul started to head to the end of the bar and looked around for an empty table.</p> <p>Paul spotted a table just off to the right hand side of the bar with a table in the middle and another table in the middle. He thought to himself, it is only right that I sit in a row and at the table opposite this table.</p> <p>Paul leaned over the table and his legs were starting to ache. He sat on the edge of the table near the bottom. He looked at a couple of guys sitting at other tables near the other side of the room. They were chatting with their friends as they waited. One of the guys was really hot. He was about Paul's age and he was in shorts and a t-shirt.</p> <p>His pants were undone and showed off his muscular leg and shapely ass. The guy behind him had his shorts unbuttoned and he was giving Paul a sly stare as he casually tossed off his shirt. Paul glanced over and found an empty table across from where he was. He could not see the guy sitting in it because of his shirt but he saw his ass swaying in the small table in the middle. Paul found that he was turned on by the thought of fucking someone in a room full of people nearby.</p> <p>Paul started to make his way back to the table when two women with long hair grabbed Paul on the shoulders and pulled him out with a hard tug. One of the women pulled Paul to her chest and the other one pulled Paul out from behind. The two women took their pants and panties off immediately and pulled off Paul's shirt and tossed it on the table before kissing Paul on the cheek. Paul felt their tongues touching him as they kissed. He put one hand on his knee and the other in the back of the neck of the women pulling him closer to the table and the woman pulled him closer. Paul could smell the fragrance of the crotch of the woman's panties. He could smell the soft wetness of the crotch and it made him light-headed.</p> <p>Paul reached around the table for the woman lying on it pulling her panties off with his free hand with the other. He was pulling her panties down and up over her hips so she could pull them free. He then pulled them off completely and tossed them to the other woman who grabbed them and tossed them at him. Paul was not quite sure what happened after that, just that his cock wanted some relief and was being held tight. He had forgotten about both the woman in the front of the room and his friend sitting at the other table.</p> <p>Paul felt the juices starting to run out of his cock as he imagined fucking the woman in front of his friend right next to him. His hips were bucking up and down as he tried to get his hard dick out and enter the woman's moist pussy.</p> <p>Paul was working up the courage to say something to the guy at the other table as the two women were kissing passionately now. The way it was going, Paul said, "I'm going to fuck you," and the woman stood up straight as if they had never done anything together before except kissing and fondling each other. As Paul watched in disbelief, the woman sat down next to the guy and put her panties back on over her panties but instead of putting them back on as it usually would have been, the woman pulled one of her legs over the other and she sat on the other one.</p> <p>Paul was starting to get very excited as he watched and saw the pussy on the other women moving over to the man sitting with him so he had his turn fucking the woman. The woman sat down between the two of them and the man in front of her stood up and offered his cock. Paul watched in amazement as he stroked to the cock that stood straight up in the air from the two women and the man fucking him. Paul was getting so hot to see that his dick was hard and that he just wanted to take it in his hand and jerk it off. of it. He wanted to jerk off of it and fuck another cock and jerk it. Paul.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>but he couldn't have him now and was going the woman he was andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
