The Doctor’s coupe had returned for him and stood before the porte cochere. She did not wish to</strong> disturb, but it was late and Edna was tired. When Edna's hand touched the side of the table, her stomach flipped through a series of butterflies and she closed her eyes. The air was warm in the middle of the ship and in that time there were no crowds on the surface. Her mind was still foggy. She did not want these men to see her body but still she could not escape her body.</p> <p>Her legs opened, knees together. The muscles in her legs rippled as the air and water rushed in between them. Edna's toes curled in her sandals like a bowstring on an invisible string. Her head rolled back and her breathing was rapid and ragged. Her back arched like a cat as her fingers toyed with her clitoris. She pushed her body forward with each breath. She moved her fingers across her face like a cat.</p> <p>The man behind her bent down. His mouth took her by surprise but she enjoyed. "Ohhh," she exclaimed in bliss. He took her between his legs and gently rocked her body back and forth. His hands went up her body. Edna felt her body shift. He was rubbing the front of his body with the backs of his hands. He began to rub and pinch her nipples so hard and firmly that Edna thought she would rip. She was lost in his touch. His hands had an erotic rhythm down her body, one that excited Edna's body.</p> <p>The Doctor's hand reached to her waist to pull her down. She stopped him but did not protest. Her chest was heaving and she was flushed up the face.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful."</p> <p>Edna closed her eyes and let the Doctor's words touch her, just a touch.</p> <p>The Doctor put his hands on Edna's hips before he leaned forward and put his head on one of her knees. He put his hands on Edna's stomach. From there his hands slid up to Edna's breasts. The Doctor began to tease her nipples again. The fingers in Edna's pussy moved in two circles.</p> <p>Edna didn't know the names of all the male actors in the action on stage. She was a porn star but the Doctor's touch and words did more than that. It was wild to Edna. Her body shuddered and trembled as her mind became lost in ecstasy but the Doctor knew what he was doing to her.</p> <p>After what seemed like an eternity, the man stood up. Edna moved her head forward and gasped at his cock. His erection was thick and long. Edna felt it press against her, just above her mouth. She had a moment of resistance but she had never before allowed a man to enter her mouth. She opened her mouth to accept the cock in search of the man that was behind her.</p> <p>After a moment she felt the man's weight shift. His hands went to her buttocks and she shivered at his touch on her body. He squeezed the cheeks of her ass. "Oh God," she moaned. His hands lifted her body. Edna's hands went back down to his cock in an effort to lift him into her mouth. He grabbed her hand and put it on a throbbing cock. She looked at his face as the cock pushed inside of her mouth. She opened to meet him, to feel his hard cock in her mouth but not enter her throat. Her fingers began to slide around the base of his shaft and her head went from the tip to the very base of his cock.</p> <p>The man's hands held her face. His breathing quickened. He could not hold back any longer. A loud groan came from the Professor. His hips thrust, forcing his organ deep in her mouth. Edna had not expected this and she tried to move her head away. To her astonishment, the cock went straight to the back of her throat. She felt the cock press into her skin to the hilt.</p> <p>"OHHHHH SHIT!" she breathed. Edna tightened her lips against the cock at the base while feeling the man's hips jerk forward. Edna tried to pull away but she found her body moving forward like a ragdoll. "UHHHUCH," she moaned again. Her hands stopped their movements on his cock.</p> <p>He moved her into the middle of the table and the Professor pushed her into the wall. Edna had stopped her movement long enough to brace herself. The man's cock moved up and down in her mouth. It would stretch her mouth wide but she felt it penetrate her throat deeper than she had ever felt anything. At the back of her throat, the Professor's cock slipped in and out. The Professor's length moved to the base of her throat.</p> <p></p> <p>head. Edna was a sensation. She wondered. Edna had never before.
