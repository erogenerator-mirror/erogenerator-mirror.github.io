She gave me an enigmatic smile as I reached to take her into my arms. Her lips met mine in a hungry kiss. She moaned as our tongues touched. The kiss ended and we were in the midst of our mutual appreciation.</p> <p>"Let's go inside and finish what we started." My tone was as matter of fact as hers.</p> <p>"What did you have in mind?" she grinned as we took off her blouse.</p> <p>"This," I said, reaching my fingers over her breasts.</p> <p>We kissed again, then she raised her arms to let me pull her dress up her body. Once she was naked, I stood back to look at her, but she just lowered her eyes.</p> <p>"You'll really be pleased with what I got to offer. But that's the thing. My husband has the advantage of having a daughter and I'm sure you can satisfy him with your hand."</p> <p>"And," she added, then took my hand, "and I'll be happy to please him. Please yourself, darling. Just let me get my things."</p> <p>She stepped back into my embrace, and then wrapped her arms around my neck.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, her eyes shining, "I'll certainly be pleased. Oh, I'm certainly willing to do all this. Just let me go. Please? If you do this, you won't be able to fuck me, or I'll just turn you away."</p> <p>"We'll decide our course now." I looked into her eyes. She held out her hand before letting go and stepping backward. I picked up her things, helping her dress and shoes over her head.</p> <p>It took us ten seconds to reach the back corner of the bus ride to the campus. It was a nice day, a nice day to visit a friend in a different city of residence. We were soon taking the bus to the house. After a few minutes of pleasant, if not pleasant, hugs and kisses, I leaned into her to kiss her on her cheek and turn to head over to my bedroom. With her arms in mine, she followed, then into the bedroom and we kissed again. Without breaking the deep kiss, she stood me up and stepped backward into my arms. We kissed, our kisses were wild. Her hands ran along the contours of my body, caressing and grasping. My hands explored her long, shapely body. My fingers found the curve of her butt, and she squirmed her hips to get me to caress her. Finally, I pushed the dress down over her hips, exposing those round breasts with their stiff dark pink tips, where her thin blouse was bunched up, the flesh tumbling out. She wore no slip at all. Without breaking our kiss, I stepped away before she could unbutton my shirt. In one motion, she reached up and unzipped my pants, then reached in and took my cock. For the first time, it wasn't a full erection, and she took me inside her mouth. She sucked me deeply before letting go. After a while, I turned her around so that she faced away from me, and I spread her legs so that my penis was at the entrance to her cunt, poised at the gates to paradise. I paused for a while as she squirmed in anticipation, but then thrust myself inside her hard and deep, burying myself inside her heat.</p> <p>"Oh, you're so tight!" I exclaimed, looking down at her body, framed in the bedspread we'd been lying on when we began.</p> <p>"But you're so big," she murmured, her eyes closing to enjoy it. My words only encouraged her further. Her eyes opened fully.</p> <p>"Do it, darling. Let me know when to stop," I said as I began to pound her vagina in hard, long deliberate strokes, my hands moving to her tits to help her keep her balance while I fucked her hard. When her hands were around me, and she was clinging to me, I was ready to start.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!!! Oh, please, darling, fuck me!!!" she cried out. She bent her knees to keep her balance while I continued to fuck her pussy rapidly. Then I stopped, stood up so she could turn over. Her legs were shaky as I lifted her off the bed. Holding her by her butt, I leaned down and took her breasts in my mouth, rolling my tongue over her hardened nipples. She closed her eyes, her mouth slack, as I turned her over and entered her again. In moments she was screaming and thrashing on the bed. Suddenly, with a look of ecstasy, she came, and her hips pressed forward to meet me, my cock inside her and her, inside her body, as her orgasms took her pleasure. I came and for her, my body, and I filled myself. With each orgasm, my body.</p> <p></p> <p>A moment—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
