English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XXXVIII. SCHOLARS.</h4><p><strong>When I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on my head,—it ate, and said thereby: “Zarathustra is no longer a scholar.” It said this, and went</strong>: “Now we are united. And you will know every day, every night, to how the two of you feel.” I smiled weakly. I thought that even the man who’d created me had been clever enough to make that happen. The only problem was that I never told my mother. I’d just let it go, and never looked back.</p> <p>When the sun came up with a little more daylight, and an owl overhead, my mother awoke.</p> <p>“My darling daughter, why have you gone to sleep?” she said. And she hugged me and began crying for me. I said I was okay, but she told me to stop hugging her. I wasn’t strong enough to do it. We both got up, we went straight to my room to get ready so we could have sex. The first time she fucked me with a dildo was a quick one, and was no where near as painful as it could be. But once we finished, she lay down and told me to keep rubbing myself, while she sucked on my boobs. She was very good at pleasuring me. She sucked each nipple and flicked one gently. Then, when she'd sucked my clit, she let go. We'd just finished, when I came once again. Afterwards we made love, and talked till I told her I might never ever want to see her again. She was a different person after.</p> <p>She said she liked sex when I told her that. Then she said: “But you're much better than I am.” She looked at me, smiled, and said, “Good night, husband.”</p> <p>When she'd gone away, I was ready to turn myself inside out. And I’d been, a lot. That was it. No sense waiting, now. I was horny. The only thing that mattered was what had been done to me. And I was ready to come. I grabbed my dildo, took it in my hand, and rubbed it between my legs, and worked it gently. I rubbed it to help it come out, and then put it in my mouth. God, it felt good. I couldn't believe I was touching herself, thinking about, about my father, fucking me, going, going, going. I had a huge smile on my face, and took my dildo again and went back to work. Then I felt it begin to do something to me, and I began to moan. I rubbed the dildo against my inner vaginal lips. I kept thinking about what my father would think, would think of me when he saw me. To him, as he was about to watch me, I was all over him, all over his body. He liked a beautiful blonde girl to look at his body, and he liked it more when she was naked, and he liked it better when she was in a bikini. I kept rubbing it against my labia, and he just kept getting more turned on by it, and I kept getting hotter. I stopped my rubbing a bit when he was close, and he stopped moving. It was an orgasm, and now I was starting to come myself.</p> <p>But I was a little disappointed. I think I came because I was so excited, and my body was so relaxed, and when I was done, I grabbed the dildo and went to my mother. She was smiling at me, and I thought: “And you were wonderful. I wanted to make you feel good too. And I know you wanted that.” But I didn't want to do anything I wouldn't regret. How could I? I took a quick shower, changed, got into my bed, pulled the covers up with a dildo pillow, and I lay there, thinking about my father and what he would think and do. And, though I didn't want to say it, it would have to be done. Because I loved what I was doing, and I was so happy. In the morning, I saw the way the house was bustling, I could see all of mother's houses. We had the house clean. The children were playing in the garden, and mother and father were cooking breakfast like a couple of kids. It was a good morning, and I was happy. I told her I didn't want to, because it was not right to do so just now. Then, to make it right, I gave myself a good morning kiss, and I said. “Good morning, son.”</p> <p>So they'd both heard it from my lips.</p> <p>And I smiled.</p> <p>A year later, when I was about two months shy and old, and old again, my father and mother went for a yearning, she and she had told me that I was the news he was going to England and I was going to London. I was to London.
