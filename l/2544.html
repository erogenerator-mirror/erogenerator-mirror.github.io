We are only going to fuck, you said.</p> <p>What's the difference?</p> <p>'Cause we've already been fucked and you didn't even know it.</p> <p>Now's why I didn't want to bring a condom with me?</p> <p>"Well, don't worry," I laughed. "I just have to use my fingers, too."</p> <p>"Do you, too?"</p> <p>"Don't you want to try and find my tongue, when you fuck it?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm pretty sure you can find it. How about we do a 69?"</p> <p>"That sounds good. I'll take that with just your cock now. If I do this wrong, it makes it impossible to do anything else."</p> <p>A funny thought came to my mind. "Hey, it's already been a hundred years since I actually do that. I've only had sex once. And if you hadn't had me suck you first, I wouldn't have minded if you were in that situation."</p> <p>And again, the humor of the thought is gone.</p> <p>"I never said I didn't want to do anything. I'm not even sure about doing that. But the sight of your cock, in my mouth, is so much better than doing any porn."</p> <p>He looked at me, surprised.</p> <p>"I was going to suggest you do it, or ask if you were OK with it, but since you didn't even know I could be a slut, I just thought that maybe a little teasing would help you find out. I guess I can't really take that risk," he said, a sly smile playing across his lips.</p> <p>"I could suck it right away, but not right away, if you want me too," I said, reaching down to play with his cock, which was now semi-hard, though not as thick as I was in my fist. His cock had a certain degree of rigidity with my hand, like a muscle. He moaned, and as he said, "I want to fuck you, so bad," he pulled me down on top of his face and I felt his hands on my cunt, then his mouth on my clit.</p> <p>"Suck my cock, please," I said, taking his cock in my mouth, taking him in so deep, it almost felt as if I would have to breath. It was too much for me to handle, even though I had only taken his cock in one mouth in my entire life.</p> <p>"Do what you want. Take it all," he instructed.</p> <p>He seemed to like the sound of that. We spent a few minutes in that sort of role-play. I felt him rubbing my cunt, and my hips bucked into him in response, almost lifting my own legs up over his shoulders. I sucked his cock deeper and faster, using all of my skills to heighten the sensations of pleasure, as he brought me closer and closer to the edge. I knew I was going to be able to take it in a bit more than he was capable of giving, or maybe he was just as eager for my pussy as I was. I felt his cock throb in my mouth, and suddenly felt his lips move on mine. He kissed me deeply, for the first time ever, and I felt his tongue enter my mouth. That, together, felt nice, and I felt that first orgasm start. I felt his fingers in my cunt, holding me close to send me over the edge.</p> <p>But as soon as I felt the end of that surge, as his mouth left mine, and I felt the flood of our juices on his hand, I thought I had better get up, so that we could get some sleep. But instead of letting me go, he pulled me up from the chair and we kissed again, like two old lovers.</p> <p>"Are you really in for it tonight, or just hoping that you can get me a better night?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm in," he said.</p> <p>Then he turned me around until I was facing the window, and he put his arms under each of my legs. When his hands were holding my hips, I felt the head of his cock pressing against my cunt. I tried to wrap my legs around him, but there was only a thin sliver of fabric separating us. The skin of his shaft was covered in me. I felt it, too, and it sent a shiver of ecstasy through me. Andi.</p> <p></p> <p>"What are you going to do now?" he asked me, because I think that to you want, tell him, that this I should you want," I think, and it to</p> <p></p> <p>and is, and when youâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
