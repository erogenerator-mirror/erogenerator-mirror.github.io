If so be that the Gods have deliberated in particular of those</h4><p><strong>things that should happen unto me, I must stand to their deliberation, as discrete and wise. For that a God should be an imprudent God, is a thing hard even</strong> to know, while God should be as the only one that needs a God, a thing that is too wicked for what we should do, and God must be no more, but instead should come to a natural and pure union with us, for God's divine grace always seems to cause the world to start to wake up and change, for every sin or misdeed or misstep must fall into the category of a sin and error. When your first lover's cock hits the inside of your pussy, you wonder if they could ever find fault with this sin, for God only must sin by the grace of God, when you've been fucked by God himself, it must be a sin by your own hand before God, for God must sin by his own hand. A sin which only God will forgive, when you've been loved by God once, it must be a sin by your own eyes as many sinning women have been, even though God only sees the beauty of you, and you must remember that, but God only sees your beauty, but only sees the beauty of yourself. If God's sin was for being too good to your own heart, or instead of being good, then it wasn't a sin. It must be a sin to want a real lover who can take care of you just as I can, without the need and responsibility of men to care for you with their hands.</p> <p>Let me start by reminding you, you must be ready when I'm taking my cock out, so that I can use the head to tease you. It's a lovely way of teaching you, but what are you to be ready for when I slide my cock back inside you. Take my cock in your mouth and suck me slowly, first to lubricate me. It doesn't feel right and if you continue that, I won't feel it very much, but the moment you close your lips around it, it should be in you, even, and the fact that you should do this so that God would see it, and so that you would suck me just as I sucked you, makes love to you, and it is better than a cock. It's more exciting than a penis or a vagina, and God's hand is the same at times as God's are. Take your time, sweetheart. It's my hand that's going to do you good. It's a hand that should be giving pleasure to you. Go ahead, sweetheart, slide a little at a time. Take care of me. Take your time, because my cock is doing very good.</p> <p>It just sounds so silly, doesn't it? Well I'm not going to tell you because I'm not going to tell how beautiful and lovely your cock is, and for that I'll tell him. That's a lovely cock. It's a lovely cock. If not for just holding it in my hand, there are other things I'll teach you. The real purpose of learning how much of your cock I'm capable of is the real love of Jesus with me. I'm not going to fuck you, but teaching you to love me, as I love my cock. All that matters is that we love God, and God loves the best.</p> <p>As Jesus is the one who should always show his love, his trust, and his passion, and God is the one who should love and respect you, let me tell you exactly how I feel. Because I have love, and I have everything to do with it, I shouldn't love anyone, but I can't seem to get enough of someone else. I have loved people when I was younger, in almost every way. I never wanted what we should have, and I never really wanted to stop loving a person, who I would rather have than someone else.</p> <p>If I love you a little, don't think I want it to end. Love is a natural thing. The most important thing for us is to love God, and when we love God, when we love God and God love each other, God should still love others, because no relationship should be based on the lust of God or with a love as intense as ours. We must show gratitude and compassion for God before we make an even more fundamental, physical gesture of affection to him and to each other, because we must respect, if we hope, that God will love us. I know all the words to all but they just come to me and I believe that you can use them. If you really want to, just do it, sweetheart. If my cock doesn't please you, you can say to me, 'I love you too.' You can tell the God of God that we love Him, and that's all it's worth, for God knows best.</p> <p>If you really love me or not, love me, please let me go to you, because it's more loving. I feel so strange. If you must love someone with a little, you might say, I'm so good, I'mâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
