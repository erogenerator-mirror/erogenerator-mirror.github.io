I led them to the palace walls,</strong> with the heavy heavy brass bedstead, the iron key in one of the handles and the iron handle of the heavy round glass door that would lead in between the pillars.</p> <p>A few minutes later they both entered their palace, and both of them stripped down to their loincloths as they had done with the other. They were both fit and lean; but were neither of them that good of a looker. My god, the man had muscles around his waist. In my experience there is a man as well as there was a woman at a crossroads and there would be no doubt about it. The man on the other hand looked like a statue and was so strong, that it was as if he had been born of fire.</p> <p>I stood behind him, caressing his neck and shoulders. His shoulder flesh was cool against my bare skin as I moved to kiss the nape of his neck and shoulder. He gave a soft sigh as I did so, and his hands moved to my waist and began moving upward. For a while, I did my thing, teasing his nipples with an occasional little tug or so, then turning my attention to his groin, making sure his already growing cock was fully erect. He gave a shudder and pushed me away, making me laugh at that, and it was more for my liking.</p> <p>We spent a few minutes just having fun with him, and he was soon getting horny as hell, so his cock was standing up on its own, jutting out like a jack-o-lantern. His cock is something to see, and it was all I could do to not look at it, when it did a full on erection. My own cock had never had the pleasure of seeing such a specimen, but it was my own cock, and I was not going to be denied it.</p> <p>His cock began its usual reaction to me. It started to move, stiffening, as it rose in my hand. I brought my tongue down to the knob, and slowly circled the swollen head of the cock. He gave a gasp and a moan and began moving his hips to rub his dick against my face. All I could manage to do was rub my lips on the crown of his cock, to suck on the head of his cock, just the way he had done to myself, and it started to get harder.</p> <p>By now, he had moved his hands down to my shoulders, forcing me to raise my face upward with a nod of his head. I let him do the work, and at last, as it happened, his cock rose out of my hand, to stand up and thrust itself into my face. I let his cock, as if in a trance, drop back to its' natural state, then went from one to the other, licking and sucking on the crown, circling the glans, and taking his cock head into my mouth, then back again. He was in heaven.</p> <p>After a few minutes of him, making no attempt to be a regular customer of his cock, I reached to his groin and felt for his cock. I found it, with no difficulty, and I turned my attention to his stiff rod, making sure I wasn't interfering in the pleasures that I seemed to be building up to. I began to stroke his balls as I stroked his cock, while simultaneously giving a small squeeze to the helmet above my lips.</p> <p>I lifted my face to look at him, and he said, "Oh my god.." and then with a laugh, he looked at me with another grin, and said, "You are a natural, and you're so hard. My god, you want it?"</p> <p>"You want it? Yes, your cock does, you want it?"</p> <p>"Yes, honey. Of course I want it" He was close to tears of joy. "I want that, I want you fucking me, I want you to make love to me." That made me happy indeed, to know he really liked me.</p> <p>"Good, you are good, too" I said as I lifted my head and began stroking his cock again with my mouth. I continued to watch, moving my hand back and forth along his penis, making it twitch all the better. He began to arch his buttocks back, and I lifted my hand back up, to see what I had done.</p> <p>He gave a moan and his hips jumped forward. I watched as his cock moved, up the shaft, along the crown. I took a little more and took his cock head into my mouth, letting saliva escape from my mouth down to his cock, in order to slide on it with my tongue. It slid back out slowly, the head and the base of his cock getting slick with it. I went back to his head again, then, and went back down again. I swirled the spit in, licking all over it as I went. Back with my lips I went, taking more saliva as fast as I wentâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
