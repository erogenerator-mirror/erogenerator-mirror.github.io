The first thing they did when the children were out of year had found him in the spare bedroom writing a letter in his bedroom, before opening the door to make a date.</p> <p>When it came to sex, neither of them had to be in a hurry about it to get him to bed. They could wait. Of course, by then he could be as impatient as he needed to be, having an erection every second day.</p> <p>Besides, they wanted to be in the moment when it came about and not be disappointed when it didn't. Because each of them would be doing everything they could to achieve it, they wanted to ensure that their marriage had nothing to do with the other.</p> <p>Of course, it was their job to ensure that his erection was never about to be denied.</p> <p>But sex. Of course. It wasn't so much being an absent minded little fucker because they got up late in the morning and slept like the dead. Or it wasn't so much because they slept soundly until they were out of sight when their spouses would wake up, then they slept soundly.</p> <p>So that was the point where they left the room, leaving their bedroom door open.</p> <p>Of course, this was too much to ask for.</p> <p>Now, she always felt so guilty over losing their marriage, as if her marriage was forever just to avoid a bad marriage, especially when its outcome might involve making a lot of unhappy love and sex. Well, she was too old, but they were both too old to keep any sex. That's the reason they should just keep having sex. Their sex life was fun and exciting, but it made them have so much sex without any of the guilt or discomfort they would probably feel. When their spouse finally stopped sex and came home to make sure that their sex life was going good by doing it while they were there, all she could do was lie back and enjoy sex and being sexually satisfied.</p> <p>After all, they were just using each other, as if it was something that they wanted to keep after all.</p> <p>The only way they could avoid guilt was by having sex before they were even married, before their life got too expensive or too complicated. And then they couldn't forget about each other.</p> <p>And the only way they could avoid sex in general anyway was by having the sex, after they were married.</p> <p>So while there's no way to avoid sex without ruining what could be a beautiful and exciting, exciting marriage, then neither of them could ever avoid it by having the sex with their spouse. * * * * *</p> <p>But since they were so busy right now, their sex life was even more boring than before. And their sex life just became shorter. Until they started fucking again.</p> <p>After their sex life was too boring they both just thought of sex as "just a distraction."</p> <p>They had sex because once they were alone, both the partners would be in another room fucking, which was the point of having sex in their marriage. After their spouses started making love there was no point in trying to keep anything from happening again with sex at every moment.</p> <p>Besides, there was always someone who would have sex with somebody else, even when they were having their children.</p> <p>Especially especially if they didn't want it to happen and were worried about it.</p> <p>Yet, they had the sex and they were happy. If there wasn't another person, it would still be sex and not even a barrier.</p> <p>Then they would finally get around to fucking each other again.</p> <p>Because it wasn't worth the anxiety if it wasn't any reason that they couldn't do it again. It had to be something else.</p> <p>"Okay," said Julie, "so are you ready to get to bed?"</p> <p>"Yeah," said Mark, "We've got to do it already!"</p> <p>"Come on," said Julie, "Let's take a shower."</p> <p>* * * * *—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
