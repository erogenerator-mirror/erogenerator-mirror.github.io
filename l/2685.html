If the Soveraign of one Common-wealth, subdue a people that have lived under other written Lawes, and afterwards govern them by the same Lawes, by which they were governed</strong> by, you're a free man and as such, you got to choose whatever law you want to be, and I'm going to fuck you."</p> <p>She was right. I chose Law Enforcement. I wanted to be like her.</p> <p>It was my fifth time in three days since I'd gone to Law Enforcement and my first in three weeks.</p> <p>As I slid my stiff, fat seven inch throbbing dick inside my naked slutty, little-boy-toy, I groaned deeply. "Sooooo... pretty..."</p> <p>It was like she was in an alternate universe with me, with herself, and me and with our new relationship, with all of the things that could be discussed about us when others are being fucked by strangers.</p> <p>I felt like an actor getting to do the scene as I fucked her against the concrete wall of the apartment building. A couple of hundred feet away, naked, bound and helpless, we were a perfectly beautiful sight that could easily be filmed, and even if there wasn't a camera filming it, at least we were fucking.</p> <p>I felt more aroused by the act than even I did at that moment. It was like nothing else that I had ever thought about before.</p> <p>For the first time in my life, I felt like a real man with his clothes off. Not just the naked one. She was naked. She was a beautiful girl. And I was fucking her, in a new way, fucking her even more than I was fucking her husband.</p> <p>I pulled out as I was cumming and jerked my stiff cock, shooting a huge hot load of cum onto her stomach. She was still bent over the front of my unit. "Fuck me, you son of a bitch."</p> <p>"Girlfriend," I panted, still catching my breath from the moment I'd already fucked her. "I didn't mean anything by, 'us', girlfriend."</p> <p>"No," she said, "you got nothing to do with it." She pulled me between her legs again, this time facing the camera. "Just watch for a while, then you can fuck like nobody else." She pointed toward the two cameras, one on the camera and one on the sideboard below her. "We're going to the next location, honey."</p> <p>I leaned forward on her chest, my balls touching her, and she reached out her hands behind me to untie my cock. "That's going to be our last place, honey," she said.</p> <p>I'd just fucked for the fifth time. It would start in my apartment right after lunch the next day, about six.</p> <p>"Yeah! No! I mean. Yes! Yes! Oh... god!" she panted as my still flaccid penis slipped from her.</p> <p>I looked at the big-breasted girl, lying on her back, my dick dangling over her stomach, her face turned toward the camera, her legs spread. "What's you got, girlfriend," I said. "I'm supposed to be the guy you've fucked. Just like, you're supposed to fuck this thing for you on camera, with all that stuff."</p> <p>"No, you fuck! You fuck this thing," she said. "I'm a girlfriend, not some slut. I'm not fucking anyone else."</p> <p>"Then who's taking it?" I panted, still naked.</p> <p>She had already got up and was leaning over the camera. "I'd be the first to film this."</p> <p>"Wait here," I said, standing up, and moving to the kitchenette, where the fridge was. I made a pot of coffee and added hot water to it and the coffee and then, I walked back to the living room. "I'll put my shoes on," I said.</p> <p>"I'll leave my boots here."</p> <p>I turned to walk across the room to the closet, where, as expected, she had her clothes on. She looked over her shoulder at me, her huge breasts swinging, with the big brown nipples in an almost-erecting fashion. "I don't need that," she said. "I know how to dress for a day."</p> <p>* * * * * * * * *</p> <p>There were no cameras around, no cameras on the sideboard or in the closet upstairs, no cameras on the walls or on the shelves. No cameras on the walls, no cameras on the shelves. One, that seemed to make sense, must be the floor. It was a square floor, with one corner of it just about the same size as the floorboard. It was a square piece of the floor, but it was on the square part of it, with two sections that could just about match. It was the floor. If you moved around and came around, then, you could also move and it, so that square as well.</p> <p></p> <p>you could stand in-thatâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
