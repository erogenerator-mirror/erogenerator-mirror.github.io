My eyes turned instinctively</strong> to the direction of the noise and stopped their way up. I'd known my own body to be in tune with the sound of a voice. I felt my head tilt forward again, as I made the decision I deserved. I'd come to this spot.</p> <p>My footsteps echoed behind me and down the hill. There it was once more and then it was back, my tongue found the path to the heart. I made my way along the backside, my face and stomach moving along the path. In front of me was the path to the trees. I paused there for a moment. Then without another word from anyone I reached down and grasped the path. I had to cross back there until I thought I'd be safe, which would have required less than two minutes and a lot of concentration. I climbed up the hill and onto the trail.</p> <p>There, I felt the grass and brush. And it was not soft grass, not soft earth. It was as close as I could get without moving any part of my body. I had no idea this path led directly to the woods, but I knew it did. I could not move more than one foot on the ground and my head was still bent on the path. I stood up and felt the grass and the soil under my foot as I made my way back toward my house.</p> <p>I went to the house and made myself as comfortable as I could. I did not bother undressing completely, but I kept the outfit on. The only thing I had on was the bra and the white nylon panties that went with it. I found a bottle of wine and made my way to the couch with my legs spread wide, one foot on the seat and the other on the floor. I felt my juices and my clit tingle as I felt the satin panties. They were sheer in the light. They were soft as silk on my wet pussy lips, and I wondered if they would be the same colors on my ass. I pulled them and watched them fall and land on my exposed ass. I rubbed them along my pussy lips to add friction and then dipped them into the wine bottle. I had to hold them inside me, holding them away from my body so I could not touch my clit. I opened up one of them and pulled the panties into the middle.</p> <p>Then I walked around the couch, feeling my tits move as I moved. I moved around the couch, moving the satin and the cloth across my nipples so they were standing out hard and erect. I made my way to the door of my bedroom, where I locked the door while I removed the panties. I turned down my music and moved a small wooden bench down the room hallway. When I entered the bedroom, I turned and made my way naked to the bed with my legs parted to the right, then left. I lay on my bed and closed my legs, moving them, then my arms away from them so I lay down. I was already erect from my teasing of the night before. I could not resist that erection and slowly removed my nightgown and lay bare, my legs spread. After I did, several strokes, I moved to masturbate myself in front of my self so that I could look at my own body. I rubbed my clit and ran my fingers along the lips of my pussy. My juices were running down my ass and leg, and I took them with mine down to my knees. I pulled the panties to one side and inserted my fingers into my wet hole, moving them in and out as fast as I could. A soft moan escaped me. I was close. I took my clit between my fingers and began rubbing it in all directions, from my neck to my toes and back to both sides of my pussy before moving up again, rubbing the top of each side of my clit in full view from the side view. I felt my body go stiff, my hands went from touching the inside of my legs up to my tits. I kept rubbing them like a cat, I wanted so much to be touched like this, and the touch, the touch, and the feel of my hand on my pussy was the same sensation as the touching of a man. I opened my eyes and my face began to quiver as I took my finger, one by one, into my mouth, and sucked on it.</p> <p>My hand stopped rubbing, and I lifted my feet on to the chair in my room. Then I took several long, slow, slow strokes from my knees to my clit. Then the middle finger, down my cunt hole, and then into my hole in my vagina as my other hand started to rub. I kept up, my other hand was inside of me faster as my fingers touched the top of my pussy. In my pussy. I could not care to my clit as I found the hood, the top of my clit. I could not the middle finger and my. I wanted and I wanted to my inner lipsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
