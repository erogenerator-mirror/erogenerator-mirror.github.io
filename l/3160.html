M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XX. A Good Imagination Gone Wrong</h4><p><strong>SPRING had come once more to Green Gables—the beautiful capricious, reluctant Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a succession of sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets</strong> every step—until we arrived there, right there on the doorstep of the beautiful summer cottage with two-and-a-half-the-year-old bluebirds in tow. The day was glorious in our eyes. The three of us had a bottle of champagne and a glass of sparkling cider. On this warm and sunny day, it was a magical time for all grown-up life, so to speak.</p> <p>And we were all adults here. We had brought the cottage with us, after all. We lived there with the parents of our grandchildren, who we all enjoyed having around on occasion. And we had spent the summer enjoying each other's company, even as two adults we only longed to feel and be in, not of us having sex. I've been married six years and have yet to see me with another woman. But I want to feel one with another woman before our wedding.</p> <p>"This is the perfect place," I said to the three of them, looking up at the sky, my eyes catching their. The thought made my heart clench. I leaned over in the middle of the living room floor and whispered a prayer for the people who would love us, and for those who would love us. And my hands were already on them, rubbing up and down as I turned my head away to allow them to gaze at me. They'd be just as happy to look as I was now at looking at them.</p> <p>The boys took a sip of the wine and chatted for a while, then they got up and walked to the sliding refrigerator outside, returning moments later with two more bottles and handing them to me. I took them to the table as they'd gone back downstairs after taking turns talking on the telephone. Both of them sat down on one side of me, with my leg in between theirs and their thighs. My eyes drifted down their bodies to their lap-tops again, and they were looking back at me as I made up their minds. Then I smiled.</p> <p>"It's time," I said, as I reached for the bottle. They did their best to keep their eyes locked on mine while they poured their wine. Then I spoke up. "I've got something you boys should be looking at," I said, giving them a wink. Then I poured my wine, handed it back to one of them, and asked if they'd like to go next door to have a look. I wasn't sure if any of the couples had taken the steps to the door without asking, but both of them said "yes" and went to go to our bedroom.</p> <p>"Oh, God, that was wonderful," I said, then, "But I'm hungry," and I turned to face the room. "We've got to go."</p> <p>"You're going to be late," Chris said.</p> <p>"But you don't have to leave," I replied, and we went up to see the dining room.</p> <p>It was absolutely magical. The sun shone like gold through the window that looked out on the horizon, and it was even more romantic looking to see four naked people, one man, wearing nothing but a smile, their heads together, with their legs spread in a lovely pose beneath them. I didn't know a thing about eating or eating another woman, but we'd certainly been eaten. Chris was eating Chris with our tongues, and I tasted the cum of one of his friends in his mouth while he worked his head in and out of my friend's cunt for a few strokes. I saw the two boys standing near the wall, two other men, but they turned their heads when they came to see what was going on.</p> <p>Chris got in front of me, and his head was down, leaning against the glass wall and looking right through it. I stood up, keeping the water in me, and took his dick in my hands. I rubbed it up and down, feeling it get even bigger and harder every time I put it inside me. Our hands intertwined, and we both watched as he pumped himself into me, filling me more completely with his cock than I had ever known, and stretching my tight cunt. He came with a roar, and then we just kept seeing the look on both our faces. Chris's cum was oozing out, dripping down to meet the glass on the wall, and we both moaned.</p> <p>"Shit," Chris sighed. He wiped his cock with the bottle on the sink counter in front of him, and then he gave me one last kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"Don't be too late," I said to him. "It's getting pretty late." Then I kissed Chris's forehead, and then I took Chris's hand and walked out to the front. His car, and watched to my car, and the drive.</p> <p></p> <p>"Chris," the truck. "And," the, " the car. car. car." car. the. car " car—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
