They met every day when they could manage the space and Dorian knew she looked out to see the garden where everyone lived. The man looked up from his video game and asked, 'What can I do to help?'</p> <p>'You can suck on the dildo,' a brunette said softly. Dorian Gray blushed under her bright, bright, bright eyes with only her face showing. 'It's only you and me.'</p> <p>'I guess it's your turn.' He said it in an excited voice. Dorian sighed as he picked her up into his strong arms and carried her out to the conservatory.</p> <p>He laid her gently on her back across the table, the dildo in his hand. He knelt up between her legs, one at a time and moved his hands up, over her tummy and under her top shirt, pulling up the shirt, feeling her skin tremble under his hands. He started rubbing her breasts with his own hands, then moved down over the swell of her tummy to her waistband of denim.</p> <p>'Please stop,' she panted, squirming on the table. He lifted the bottom of her skirt, letting it slide past her hips. Then he reached behind, and unzipped the top. 'No.'</p> <p>'Please,' she panted as his hand passed over the swelling of her right breast, cupping it in his hand. 'Stop it,' she cried as his fingers brushed over her nipple. He pushed on it with his finger, rubbing over the hard, pink tip of the nipple. A drop of clear liquid slid down her nipple, trickling over her areola.</p> <p>'No,' she panted one last time. 'No.'</p> <p>Dorian stopped and stared at her chest, then slowly, achingly slid the skirt the rest of the way down her trim waist. She stood there naked, not moving.</p> <p>'It's a big cock,' was all he said.</p> <p>She smiled nervously at him, her chest heaving under his stare. 'You really want to do this now?' she wondered. 'Is that what that is like?'</p> <p>Dorian Gray was not only the sexiest girl in the world, but the sexiest fucking girl in town. It had been some time since he had made love to any man - apart from his own wife of nine years - and certainly not with a woman at all. He was more reserved with women, after all. But when he had gone down on a woman and that didn't happen, he found it a huge turn-on, a challenge.</p> <p>'If you want me to,' he said, pushing her down flat on the table again, 'Then, go through it.'</p> <p>'You mean,' she looked worried and hesitant, 'we could be naked?'</p> <p>'I mean we could be fucking,' he said, lifting his own t-shirt. She lifted her head slightly to look at his hairy torso then gasped when it touched the hairline. He lifted his hand, then slipped the shirt over his head, tossing it away as fast as it flew off him. He was naked except for his shoes; she gasped again when she saw his penis, stiffening and stiffening a little, standing straight out from his groin.</p> <p>'Is that nice and hot, Dorian?' she said softly, her breasts jostling.</p> <p>'Yes, yes it is. You'll like it.' He had taken it to hand, he realised, and started stroking it.</p> <p>'But I don't,' she said.</p> <p>'Why not?'</p> <p>'I don't want to be naked,' she added.</p> <p>'Why not?' he said, 'What would happen if my wife caught us?'</p> <p>'She won't,' she said firmly, 'but I just might.'</p> <p>'You don't have to do anything,' he said. 'Just go into my bedroom. You don't have to be dressed unless I tell you.' He looked at the chair in front of his window from where he dropped down to sit on the floor. He picked up a box of tissues from his desk, handed her one, then took from her hand a box of tissues. 'Don't wipe your cunt off,' he said. He took another box and carefully lifted the tissues out of its box, then put the box back over the box of tissues. He got up and sat on the edge of the chair, leaning forward, his hands on his knees. 'I will leave this to you,' he said. 'Don't have to watch to learn anything from anybody in the world.' He looked down at her breasts he had moved, 'but she can play to the floor. No touching.' He didn't see,' his penis.'</p> <p>Dorian's hand had slid off her skirt now, too, then herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
