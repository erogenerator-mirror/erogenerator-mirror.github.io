English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LV. The Spirit of Gravity.</h4><p><strong>(See Note on Chapter XLVI.) In Part II. of this discourse we meet with a doctrine not touched upon hitherto, save indirectly;—I refer to the doctrine of self-love. We should</strong> not use the pronoun 'self' (in this case, not the pronoun 'love') as well. See in my first essay—Chapter III. We should not use the pronoun 'love', though. I know, now this makes sense, doesn't it? Let's face facts. Yes, we are being silly, but let's face facts. Sex is a human form, and God created this form for mankind to form in every way we see it, without any apparent rhyme or reason. (Remember for my essay to be in context, in the literal time of man, where mankind evolved, and God created this form for mankind.) You will also recognize many things about sex as a divine form. I am about to go into that for more effect than words in describing the existence of man. But what is sex, other than being essentially a form of creation; (a name for the creation of, in a nutshell, the existence of a God or God is the creation of the sex.)</p> <p>It is, therefore, not an exclusive form of sexual creation between all three individual parts.</p> <p>A form of sexual creation could be made as many different ways for mankind as it can be created.</p> <p>A form could be created in any of the four realms, and it could also be born in any of the four orifices of God.</p> <p>But if a sexual creation occurs in four orifices simultaneously in the four areas of creation—as if a man or a woman has the will, the will, and the willness of a person, and a woman with the will, the sexual union between two persons in a way that would be considered sexual if both are sexually stimulated by both a man and a woman, the will, will, and willness of a man, as the will of a woman, or a woman, is not sexual; but if a man and a woman have the will of a woman and a man has the will of a man a woman, and a woman, to be one in the way that sexual intercourse is formed and expressed in the individual aspects of a man and a woman, to be, in the case of sex itself, like the body or the sexual organ.</p> <p>In the case of a given form, I should refer to the individual and the couple of individual aspects of, in their eyes, as, in God's view, the individual. But there are some fundamental differences between a sexual creation and a sexual union like with a male and female, with certain conditions.</p> <p>I should mention that, in a certain regard, the relationship is based on sexual compatibility. If you are with a lover who loves you, and wants to fuck you because it makes you happy to have your lover fuck you, and love you because you feel happy and affectionate and content by having him fuck you.</p> <p>In the same condition with a lover whose love of you is based on sexual compatibility, who you can give more than you get, you can give more than you get in every possible respect. And it should always be the friend who you feel is of more value than you are of more important things.</p> <p>So we should do this by saying that if the two person and sex have had enough physical contact with each other to have a sexual relationship (like a relationship with a lover of God, and even if a lover of mine finds or is interested in having sex), and if the couple also has had enough physical contact (and if the lover is, or is) with the lover, or the man, that the sexual union is a one-way bond between two sexual beings.</p> <p>But, let's be clear. If both lovers are equal in love and affection for each other, and mutually agree to be sexual partners, both should be happy and happy, in each other's eyes. Is that a good way to do it?</p> <p>In the case of the two-sex relationship, in a certain regard, the two must be able to accept those differences between two couples and understand the difference between themselves.</p> <p>In this case, when both of the people and the relationship experience a sexual relationship of either sex, they have to be able to feel loved and comforted and loved again.</p> <p>Yes, I know, that's ridiculous. There is no way to explain it. But if one of them feels the same about the other, they can feel the same about each other. Why can't that include both? And don't think I wouldn't like to explain these things.</p> <p>My point is this; if you two agree that your sexual relationship is of equal interest to both, or the other, so long as you also have the same kind of sex, and know that loving and loving love is what makes you happy, and love is what makes you happy, doesn't it has it make you happy, can only depend on whether you have sex, that the person. So long as long as long as long as one-and the two the two—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
