At certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister. The recreation hour struck. A door swung on its hinges. The</strong> girls walked down the hall. "Good God," cried the girls, "we aren't going to do it. Where is we going?"</p> <p>"We are on the seventh floor," declared one. "We are on the first," announced the other.</p> <p>"Okay, we should be going," declared the same voice, echoing the one from before.</p> <p>The girls rushed down the stairs. The sound of music began filling the halls of the first floor. It was a sweet tune, but too young for a tune. The girls headed into the second floor. They reached the grand double doors. "What time does the song say?" asked one of the girls.</p> <p>"It says 7 o'clock," answered the other girls. They went into the foyer where the music sounded even louder. The other girls returned to their rooms. In reality they were tired, but excited and aroused. They could not get the song from the music, though. The song was all a bunch of little things.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The music was a song made by a young schoolboy friend of a friend. The girl was dancing on the floor. "I need some wine, boys," she cried.</p> <p>The guys cheered and whistled and clapped. They could not believe this girl was dancing, but she was. She was the girl in the next school dance competition.</p> <p>An idea occurred to the girls. "Let's go get a room, boys," said one of the girls. They led the guys away from the dance floor. The girls grabbed the guys' hands and dragged them to the floor. They did not bother taking off their clothes. They were naked. They all got up and followed the girls into their room! The girls pushed the men down on the carpet. "Come on, please," said one of the boys.</p> <p>The first girl knelt on the carpet between the guys legs. "I love that you guys love that," she cried, pushing down with her hands.</p> <p>The guys enjoyed a blowjob from the girl licking the pussy and playing with the hairless puckered anus. "I love that you all love making me cum," cried the girls. "When does the song say the same time?"</p> <p>The girls returned to the party. The girls sat on the floor, one on each side of the guys' heads. They pushed the guys to the carpet. The girls squirted the girls' juices on the guys' face. The guys licked the girls and ate their pussies.</p> <p>The music got louder. The song was one of those short, fast songs which the girls would sing a song from. The chorus of the girls sung into the air. The music turned out louder too. The music and dancing moved the girls away from the men.</p> <p>"Let's go on the floor. Now they have to go," said one of the girls as she pulled down the guys' pants and freed the guys' hardness.</p> <p>"They are young guys," said the other one, the one from before. The other one took a bottle of wine, poured a glass and sat on the floor next to the guys' heads. "Show us how eager young men are," she giggled. "Let me show you how eager young girls are." The girls parted knees and let the guys' tongues touch the pussy of the other. Each girl sucked the guys' tongues, and sucked their pussy hairs. The girls did other girls dance for their guys. The girls had sex with the guys, as well as the guys! But the girls didn't think they even had sex.</p> <p>The music turned out louder than a normal song. The girls began taking turns. One girl sucked the men. Another girl rode the other's pussy. The girls sucked a cock or balls and the other girl sucked the other girls tits. The girls kissed the men, tasted the pre-cum and ate pussy. The girls began to fuck the guys. One girl got a cock and began to fuck the other. Then the girls fucked the guys! The girls would have them all take turns fucking the guys. All the girls fucked the guys, too. The girls were on their knees licking the cock and balls and the girls sucking the guys. The girls sucked the guys' cock. All the girls sucked the cock of the other girl. None of the girls made any move to take the men in their mouth. The girls sucked the boys. Each of the girls had their pussy sucked or taken a cock. All the girls were sucking their husbands', and sharing their partner's pussy juices.</p> <p>The girls stopped sucking the guys' cocks. The girls took each guy in their mouth, and sucked his cock until it hardened. The girls pulled out of the men. The men. They could go on the guys. "cocks, the guys: They are to the girls of the men on the girls: The men, men—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
