She was a full-time teacher in one of my favorite classes—English Language; to be continued.</p> <p>We got into a whirlwind, learning every step of every subject, topic and technique for English and Literature and learning everything anyone could do. Our first year was the most wonderful period in our relationship.</p> <p>Jane loved it. I loved it. She was witty and imaginative. She loved to spend hours with me.</p> <p>She wasn't as sexy as I. She was young, attractive and creative. I liked her. I liked her very much.</p> <p>What more would a girl really want with Jane if she wanted to get more adventurous? If she wanted to get kinky, she'd do it. But that didn't happen. Jane was happy in her life and loved her life, but that didn't mean she cared. No, Jane loved her life and she was happy.</p> <p>Jane was adventurous.</p> <p>She had a way of finding out things that we couldn't have found anywhere else, and that she didn't want to find out herself. I loved her, but I could not live with the hurt of my life. Jane was as beautiful as she had always been, and she cared for all of me.</p> <p>The hurt was obvious, but the hurt was never worse than how we acted around others. The sting was all over our relationship. And the sting, when it came, was never ever forgotten.</p> <p>This was our first year. It was time for us to share our true purpose. We needed to have a life of loving.</p> <p>"Yes," Jane said. "Yes!"</p> <p>I loved the sounds of our little lovemaking, which Jane made sound sexy. Like I've never needed to do. We'd made love dozens of times that year. I was not going to argue this time. It was our first time. It felt like the first time we were truly committed to each others' happiness.</p> <p>Yes, I loved making love with Jane. I loved her as she was. I loved her beauty. I loved her as she was. It wasn't necessarily love, more like an emotional bond, but an emotional bond nonetheless.</p> <p>The sex was fabulous. I thought I was the lucky one that made the girls squeal in orgasm. But there was something missing. Perhaps it was the lack of commitment. Perhaps it was maybe it was because Jane didn't have a boyfriend, but it was probably a combination of all the excitement and nervousness of the first year together where life just seemed to click for me.</p> <p>I wanted to talk to her, but I had other plans. I wanted to talk to her in public. But I didn't. I would have to be careful.</p> <p>"Jane," I said. "What's up?"</p> <p>"I think we need to talk about our future," she said. "What do you think about it?"</p> <p>"You're serious?"</p> <p>"Absolutely," she explained.</p> <p>"What do you have in mind?"</p> <p>"Well, that is easy. It comes with an experience," she said. "Do you know what it means, to have a meaningful experience? Not just for a life's sake, but to see how it feels to know you?"</p> <p>"Well, maybe it's for both of us."</p> <p>"It's kind of a lot," Jane said. "We might have a life, but we can't say what we can do. The experience feels a lot easier than you think."</p> <p>"Then we need to get involved," I said. I smiled at her.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes we do. Let's do that."</p> <p>We both had dates and went to the movies. We both felt a need to go home, but Jane took the next nearest train out to the coast and I did the same. We had just gotten home from the cinema about two hours before.</p> <p>Jane didn't wear the dress she had on, but she was still wearing that sexy red dress. It fell to the floor. It was still on her from the last dance. She had on a white pair of socks, a pair of light blue shoes, a pair of white socks and a pair of white pants.</p> <p>"What's my wife look," I always wore?" I thought because it was that, well, when she wears it was sexy and looks was sexy but my wife was not sexy.</p> <p></p> <p>" it's it too ' my wife's wife was " my husband be," you like I wear," I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
