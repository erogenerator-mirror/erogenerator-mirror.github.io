The other half shrieked and prayed.</strong></p> <p>"No," I cried out loudly, not at all concerned with that. This couldn't be any worse. That was so, so fucking bad.</p> <p>The first act of this was to fuck.</p> <p>I had one of these moments just where, on the verge of losing control of the situation. I had done a great deal of fucking...and I'd never been happier in my life. This was the moment that would finally seal the final triumph of humanity on Earth.</p> <p>I'd had it all. I'd achieved the most incredible sexual fantasy in all of creation. And it was all mine.</p> <p>And I'd decided that there was no real other option, at least not in the sense that anyone who wanted to fuck me on Earth was going to have to fuck me on a ship. There would never be another ship.</p> <p>I couldn't stop thinking about it. But I did enjoy it just the same. Because if you can't fuck one fucking ship, then why don't you fuck all the others?</p> <p>My life-changing pleasure was coming when you did.</p> <p>There was nothing else to experience as opposed to fucking one ship at a time.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck", we chanted in the background of the music playing in the auditorium. I didn't care much for this. This was good. The music wasn't bad, although I felt much better. And even the music could not erase the fact that I was fucking every man in sight.</p> <p>One-half of the passengers was now dead and my fuck was in the hands of a great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great for I wasn't quite sure who was doing it. Or, more likely, was fucking my husband.</p> <p>But there was just one thing left before that final act of fucking, and that's all.</p> <p>We weren't doing the traditional missionary position - I wasn't actually going to be the one fucking. I was just going for the same fucking, and hopefully it would never get any better.</p> <p>It was enough for the audience. I had one thought, if I was going to be one of those horny fuckers watching me for the last few centuries...one of those fuckers who loved the fact that I was going to be the fucker in a few minutes, and that's what every single one of them wanted to watch.</p> <p>And so, the audience stood to one side, staring at me, waiting for the fuck I knew I would be doing. With their fucking eyes I had a fucking audience.</p> <p>There was no one else fucking me. One-half of the rest of the passengers didn't bother to move. They just stood and cheered my fuck. When the woman fucking me, I didn't care. And so I was just doing what I had to do. But even after all the fucking I'd already done, I didn't want to be anywhere else. I wanted to be in that position. I wanted to fuck all the women in the place.</p> <p>And fuck, I wanted to fuck the women right in front of them.</p> <p>There was just one thing left. I had to get on with it.</p> <p>I pulled myself off my bride's cock, taking it with me reluctantly. It had been a while since I had felt anything this wonderful. And the feeling was so fantastic that I needed to make it as intense as possible. It was no more satisfying than when I had done everything with my husband.</p> <p>The thought of having that cock inside my pussy was so exhilarating. And it gave me such pleasure, at least that it was a very good feeling, one which I wanted to do again and again. If it wasn't for the fact that it was my wedding day, I think I would be quite happy just to go up to the reception and give myself one last orgasm. But I also needed a moment of rest for everything which might go on in my world outside of that arena.</p> <p>I could wait no longer. I was going to fuck the fuck out of my darling husband and fuck every single one of his men, men men men men men. Just a few of the women wanted to watch and I would be all over them. And I was going to fuck them all.</p> <p>What a magnificent and exciting experience for them all to be watching me fuck.</p> <p>I grabbed the waistband of her skirt, yanking them down until her pussy was completely exposed. There was the most beautiful sight.</p> <p>My bride was still holding me and she had a very excited look in her eyes. She looked around the auditorium, her head up so far, so fast. The entire auditorium soxing. this cock soixing the moment of the whole planet. With my man standing soixing me my bride tomeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
