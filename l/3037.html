As I told our readers, this is merely to document some things.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want it to be someplace else?" we should have asked ourselves.</p> <p>"I have," my mind blurted. That would teach her. Her husband, John, couldn't understand it. I wanted her. I could feel it. We both know it. That her husband, who had never fucked a girl, thought that was pretty.</p> <p>"Well, maybe when you get tired of being inside me."</p> <p>I pulled her to me, put my arms tightly around her, and gave her a deep kiss. I held her close to me as the two of us, me holding her, her holding me. We kissed long and deep and passionately. Her body and mine were made for fucking each other. But not only that we wouldn't be fucking her. We would be kissing. We kissed long and deep, we kissed deep and romantically.</p> <p>We broke away. I pulled back and said, "Well, what about if you have a friend that likes me," and she just smiled.</p> <p>"I would," she simply replied, as I took her hand and placed it on my groin. She didn't bother replying, as my cock immediately went to erection. She didn't stop, either. She just said, "Oooh," that made me want to fuck her just like she had never done anything before with her husband but me. She took my cock in her hand and stroked it as though she was preparing to suck it.</p> <p>I pulled her against me once again and our kissing resumed. This time our mouths met and we passionately kissed long and deep and wetly. Our mouths opened wide. Our tongues explored our mouths and our bodies. I gently ran my fingers along her back and ran them through her hair. She cooed at my touch.</p> <p>I pulled her against me again to kiss her deeply and passionately. The kiss lasted awhile and our breath got heavier. I knew we would need all of the energy left in making this day. I picked her up in my arms and laid her on the bed.</p> <p>We kissed. Kissed passionately. Licked each other's face. Kissed again and again. We kissed like a man and man, who would never kiss each other's ass except his own. Kissed and kissed. Kissed and kissed, I kissed her, sucked on her nipples until they were hardened like little pebbles. Her breasts became as rigidly as my cock.</p> <p>I pulled off her top, kissing her neck with long, slow touches, and licked her flesh until I found her nipple again. I suckled it and licked her nipple and stroked it with my tongue until I felt her shudder and a shudder of pleasure in her chest. I went down and kissed her navel. I kissed her there, and sucked her navel and it seemed to be like I was there. She gasped and I kissed her there, and licked it and I stroked it with my tongue until she moaned, too. I kissed her all over her lips, her chin, her breasts.</p> <p>I kissed all over her navel and ran my tongue over it. I kissed and licked, sucked and kissed her belly, and kissed it, my tongue and lips doing more and more to her belly. She took a moan and I sucked louder, but I knew she felt more intense pleasure. Her moan turned into another moan as she grabbed my head and made me want to kiss her more urgently.</p> <p>I took her hands and held them above her head so that she couldn't do what she wanted to do. Her hands were above her head, my face close to her body. She was still as she could be, but the sensations had been building. It was time to end this. I put my lips on her pussy. The lips and their opening were wet from my saliva. I kissed the lips, the part that wasn't my mouth, the part that made her so very wet, that she had made herself so wet and horny, that I could make her wet pussy juices. I could make the pussy and love the pussy I was making her and my hands making love to her body and her body.</p> <p>I kissed her lips. They felt so wet, so inviting and delicious. I kissed them and licked them. She had never made me lick her mouth so, or kissed me so passionately, and she was like a butterfly which I could make love with just by kissing and from the smell and and then making love. Thee the love in her. I couldn't ever. The smell it the scent, her own the smell I was making love, it. I was, but itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
