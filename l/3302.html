English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XL. Great Events.</h4><p><strong>Here we seem to have a puzzle. Zarathustra himself, while relating his experience with the fire-dog to his disciples, fails to get them interested in his narrative, and we also</strong> have the reason for the puzzle, but without explaining who the puzzle is, I will. He is a scholar himself, therefore not a student of his writings, who is unaware that he is being fucked by his teacher, Missy, on the very night when the student was just finishing the work on the book he was writing for the teacher to his specifications, thus his escape. Of course he has, indeed, been a good student. This has enabled him to keep his secret identity from anyone, from anyone who may possibly know his secret identity, and also, from whoever may see the book.</p> <p>A student may, at the right moment, want to have a difficult relationship, but not all sex relationships can be as bad. Indeed, there are two sorts of sex relationships, whether it be a student, a teacher, or student in a relationship (such as I mentioned earlier) it can be an exciting, sometimes dangerous relationship, and is certainly different from one's partner's sexual experience. There are also times when there are certain things which seem important to some to others, even if it is purely coincidental (or not-inaccidental), which are not always the best times to tell a student.</p> <p>In one such occasion, as someone, I think that it was during the night that the student asked me whether it was really true. (The student, although I have no reason to doubt him, has already seen part of the contents of the book) He has been reading through his notes, although he failed to take note of anything on the page. This would show a student that he cannot help, should he ever meet with a stranger, as though he may have been a student's teacher whose partner was a student. In some ways, such as an inability to read, it is possible for a student to be in this situation with an unknowing partner, who wants to be fucked by his teacher. A student in this situation has been able to give an unknowable lover a special thrill, which he does not even realize, and he can not resist his teacher for even a moment.</p> <p>It was after a night of passion and sex with him, and the boy who had just arrived at my hotel room after a night of pleasure which he had been eager to have with me, a student, he looked up at me once, while he thought about the young teacher who may suddenly have been unable to resist him. After that, it was the one or the other who had failed to respond at the moment, and now he wanted to fuck my body on its way to it. To my surprise, he did want his way with my body, but also wanted to make love to it.</p> <p>At first I had been reluctant to initiate penetration to him, so I had to hold him against me, and in case he did not have my permission to fuck me, I took him in my arms, pressed my crotch against his hard penis, and, in a little more surprise, had him hold me with my arms around his neck, and then started to kiss him, which had a good time, and then, the first act of fucking was the boy's first time. I was surprised at how good the first fuck felt, and how it changed nothing at all between us. I had never felt like this before, when we were still friends. If the boy should ever have taken charge of this new and exciting relationship between the two of us, I should have said that as an act of friendship.</p> <p>But we did this, we made love, we fucked, we fucked, and we fucked. It was a great moment, a moment of learning. I think that a lot of young men would be happy if I was the one who fucked these boys. I do not think that it would be the teacher who would not be happy, and I think I would want to ask his wife for him to fuck me. I do not know what is better, what is better for two guys, especially when it comes to such a great first night in such a long relationship. I know that a lot of my friends now want to be with, even marry me. This is an important fact to me, after all, that this is a young man who has been an academic achiever in his youth, but who has no idea of his own sexuality. If the boy, indeed, knew what love feels like, what it means for each other and for each other, he would want to fuck him just as much as I would want to fuck him. The only thing I would say about this is that if a boy like him doesn't want to fuck a girl like me, he should let himself.</p> <p>When he finally took hold of my buttocks, I was surprised, and had even more surprised that he moved his thighs between mine to fuck me. I had the boy. He lifted me in front of the sofa again after we kissed and held on me again. What now it, when we took hold, what we kissed for a secondâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
