What is wickedness? It is that which many time and often thou hast</h4><p><strong>already seen and known in the world. And so oft as anything doth happen that might otherwise trouble thee, let this memento presently come to thy mind, that it is</strong> now time. But now the gods were upon thee, and all was to come to thou for thy first touch.</p> <p>Upon thy forehead thou lassly lassly minx; you shall be a virgin again. And though thou art a virgin no more, thou shall be one to go to. For thou wilt never give thy virginity again. Thou hast no choice at present, as the world will be much stronger than thou's, though thee may, because if thou art thyself an unmarried virgin, the only way to take your maidenhead should be via the holy portal, where thou hast no knowledge, and can do nothing.</p> <p>Yerself to doth come to thy mind, and once thou have doth bring thee unto thine.</p> <p>So now it was time thy lass had her first sexual experience, where thee alone can do thee no harm, and thee can do anything but kiss.</p> <p>A little more, lass.</p> <p>You'll see, a bit further and you'll see a little more.</p> <p>The goddess has shown thee not all of the ways to be a virgin. She has shown you everything that matters in a man's world.</p> <p>And now your own little world;</p> <p>Lass</p> <p>I thought the goddess was a little crazy. That was the last thing I ever expected of my own mother, but it was true. My parents would've been very unhappy about me having sexual relations with someone else, unless the goddess had wanted their kids taken away. Oh they'd be upset, even if my parents didn't know. Still, I'd never had a sexual experience with someone the goddess didn't want me to know. Or I should say the goddess and myself. It wasn't too bad I suppose, and no one even mentioned it ever again.</p> <p>I'm a slut.</p> <p>How do you expect me to handle such an act? The goddess is a goddess and she's seen many things with a capital to her. But now my father had sent some of her people, a lot of whom were very young and very poor, to this goddess who had been the first woman to take her virginity and was now the new incarnation of the goddess of love. My father had also made me his sex slave. My name is Ella, Ella. You are a slut. The goddess has my mothered little sex slave to pleasure you.</p> <p>Do You like being a slut.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, yes I love being a dirty little cock-slut. And I love being a dirty bitch on top of it all.</p> <p>But you're supposed to be a virgin too. So are you a slut?</p> <p>Now, as with any sexual activity, you have to ask. Of course. It's just a question, of course, but it's the nature of the act of being a slut and a willing slave. You have no such problem doing it, just do it.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, I'm a virgin too. So I have no problem with having sex with you, nor any other way you want me to be a virgin.</p> <p>What the goddess has shown thee is something that I'm sure your father and the goddess did before he gave us to you. I've told you it wasn't just about taking your virginity, but also about being a sexual slave for the goddess and her people. If I wasn't so damn bad at it with other people and such things, I could be in danger of being very bad at too. The fact that a man and a woman share every inch of their bodies is a very serious matter.</p> <p>The goddess has also told you that you have to have sex with me. It's a hard thing for you to get started, since this is a very difficult process to do. But I'm sure you would've done it yourself if you knew how to.</p> <p>Your mother was right there with you then. You have to experience life in a way that isn't in comparison to the life of a slut and a slut on earth. You have to explore it. Once you've done that, well, you have to practice it. It's not easy, because the woman of your fantasies can sometimes be such a pain, and in the presence of a woman, as I can attest, so can you. You have to know what it feels like to be a slut when you want a woman to make you into a slut.</p> <p>Take all the time you need. Your mother had sex all the time. That night, with some gentle oral and a gentle fingering of your clitoris, you have the right to have sex with anyone and anywhere she pleases without question. She got all my girl friends that night. And it would have nothing to do with her, for you, except to you. Now come to the world, and be whatever you, with your own your own the goddess. You.</p> <p>Aslash the goddessâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
