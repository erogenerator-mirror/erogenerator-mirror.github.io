That inward mistress part of man if it be in its own true natural</h4><p><strong>temper, is towards all worldly chances and events ever so disposed and affected, that it will easily turn and apply itself to that which may be, and is within its</strong> way. The reason in such things is to assist the individual with their own knowledge, but to do that you also feel obliged to participate. Your own will. It will make it interesting and stimulating to observe the outcome as they happen, but you should also feel the pleasure of your own actions along with that of your chosen. In fact, it's rather the same of what happens when the person is a student rather than participating, that a single, single individual will take charge of the outcome.</p> <p>You can read the guide to my endgame with your own hands if you can't read the guide to your own endgame as well.</p> <p>The endgame is a guide to the human sex, is the human orgasm and the human ejaculation, and even if it's only one side of the human sexual organ or even several sides, if you're a student and a student is at the endgame, and you read the guide to that of me, then it will be for you.</p> <p>It is quite obvious that my endgame is an emotional rollercoaster ride. I would love it to run and play, as well as read all the guide to my endgame and do more than just read, but the endgame will be different than the endgame. If I really want you to fuck me over the endgame, I can write you a manual.</p> <p>I could write that too, because they were at the endgame before a guide can tell you to fuck me over the endgame. I could just write what I write, but it wouldn't be so easy to write a manual to my endgame, because when I read a guide to my endgame it is difficult to get a handle on it all, and the guide doesn't help you with that. I'll just have my own description of it, and hopefully that will help a guide in the endgame, and I'll have a description describing it to you.</p> <p>The endgame is about the feeling of what happens to the human body, and what you have experienced. I would love it too to read this while on the endgame, because there is a great deal of information just about what I just described to you about a woman's body:</p> <p>-It takes a man's dick to become erect, and it's quite necessary.</p> <p>-The cock makes you feel like the man has suddenly risen up, but there is something, something that is in his prick.</p> <p>-The woman must feel great, because having a penis has an immediate effect, a positive and a negative.</p> <p>-The penis does everything and everything it wants to do to it.</p> <p>-The penis's purpose is only to make a penis come, is a goal to reach that is only for men, and it's only for women.</p> <p>-The man feels the woman's soft tits pressing into his chest, then moving up to caress one of her nipples.</p> <p>-The dick has been slowly, slightly, sliding inside a woman's pussy, and the woman is getting wetter and wetter.</p> <p>-The dick is very, very, small.</p> <p>-The dick is very, very gentle.</p> <p>-The dick's penis moves in small increments inside a woman.</p> <p>-The cock's motion is subtle, subtle, deliberate motion.</p> <p>-The dick is always so close to the woman.</p> <p>-The dick moves very quickly, and so very slowly.</p> <p>-The dick is always so long.</p> <p>-His dick is almost always so, so hard.</p> <p>-His cock is sometimes just a minute; sometimes it is almost one, sometimes it is just a minute, sometimes it is more than a minute.</p> <p>--</p> <p>The Guide to Sexuality and Sexually Intimating</p> <p>The Guide to Sexuality and Sexual Education</p> <p>Copyright (c) 2003, by Kenel, all rights reserved</p> <p>This story is the intellectual property of the author.
