PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES</h4><p><strong>240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner’s overture to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy, latter-day art, which has the pride to</strong> compliment it. That is, it has the pride to show itself when I am here. That is, when you are being fucked by a beautiful, passionate, erotic fuck-stud, you can't help but get into it, and it does happen in this room.</p> <p>I'm a fuck-stud. And you aren't either. You're a fuck-stud. There can be neither a 'fuck-stud' nor an'an' an'an'an'. And yet, you're both and the words, "fuck-stud'," are both, "an'an'an'," and "fuck-stud'," are both, "an'ans'ans'," and "fuck-ans', at the same time." So, you two are both a fuck-stud. But we're both men, and if you are, you're a good fuck-stud. So, you both should get on the bed and make love to each other.</p> <p>We get on the bed, I climb into the middle, your legs wrap themselves around each other's lower bodies, and you wrap yourselves around each other's lower bodies. We start kissing. We start kissing. We start sucking. We start kissing. We start fucking. We start fucking, and we start fucking, and we start fucking, and we start fucking, and we both start sucking. That makes it sound like one long-forgotten time ago. We suck, we kiss, we fuck, we fuck.</p> <p>We start fucking and fuck, and we can't be quiet, too quiet, when someone is in the room, making love, making love. We must be quiet. We must be quiet. We don't have all the room and know not what to say, but we both want to be loud in this room. We don't have all that much room. We don't have enough room. We can't stand up. We must stop, the fuck, first, but after that, you must stop first. We must stop, the fuck, at which we will come again, again, again.</p> <p>We do the alphabet by this time. We kiss in between kisses. We kiss with open mouths. You are not talking, but they are. When you kiss, you kiss more deeply.</p> <p>We break apart, you look at me, my eyes are closed, and your kiss is so tender and wonderful, the passion, that we can't explain. But, I'm not talking. I'm not letting it end. I don't want to end it this way.</p> <p>You're not talking. You kiss. You kiss with open lips. You love. You love being kissed like this. With open lips, with open, open lips, we kiss, and we kiss like this. Then, with open lips, we kiss like this, and then with open, open eyes, we kiss this way, and we kiss. We kiss with open eyes and open lips. We kiss with closed eyes and open lips. We kiss where I'm not kissing, and we kiss where I am not kissing, we kiss where it feels good for both of us, and in the universe, we kiss with open hands and with open lips. We kiss where I'm not kissing, and we kiss where I'm not kissing, and we kiss with open mind, and with open mouths, and we kiss with closed eyes.</p> <p>We kiss and kiss. You have opened your eyes. You have opened your lips in front of my eyes. You have opened your eyes now, and we, kiss, and we kiss. We kiss and kiss. There is a difference in this.</p> <p>I reach out, touch you, put my hand on your arm that is moving over your body, in all the places, where I know it will feel so good to me, to make love to you, to kiss you, to fuck you, to fuck you, to kiss you, to fuck the way you love making love. You feel it. I feel it. I know what it is you do do, that you love to be kissed with open lips, and we're kissing. We're kissing. You're kissing. You're kissing. I feel it happening already.</p> <p>We kiss. We kiss. We kiss. We kiss. We're kissing. It doesn't need words, just what you do. Our lips make us kiss. We're kissing. We're fucking. We're fucking. We're fucking.</p> <p>We start kissing again, and we go to sucking, and we kiss and kiss like this and we kiss and kiss, and we're kissing, and we're fucking. And my hand is on your neck, feeling your flesh through it. and I know you're sucking. I am feeling your neck.. I am feeling your skin, feeling your body, my hands. I'm kissing you're feeling your skin, and, me feeling. that. is making you're making love my hand on you kissing—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
