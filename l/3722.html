It was time to fuck.</p> <p>"Here's to your first fucking."</p> <p>"Here for the night, my sexy ass virgin."</p> <p>"To your first ever fisting."</p> <p>"To your fisting.</p> <p>"To your first ever fucking."</p> <p>"To my first ever fucking."</p> <p>"Let me give you a hand job first."</p> <p>We laughed at that.</p> <p>That was pretty well planned out and fun. The action in the bedroom was fun. I had no idea just how much fun it was, and how much fun it would be.</p> <p>At the start of the second time we were at it, Candide was doing his best to make sure that I was okay with this. Then he added on, "You're so close to me."</p> <p>I was too. That was what was keeping me sane. Then, when Candide was deep-throating me, I got the impression that Candide was not only getting himself off, but also getting into things with his own cock.</p> <p>There was something about the act and the way that I felt with him that made me excited to even the most innocent of men. It gave me the sense that he was, indeed, taking control of the situation. He really wasn't quite in the mood to let go.</p> <p>His cock was getting hard. He was breathing hard too. His cock was getting harder.</p> <p>I reached my hand down and felt for myself. I was getting warm with it all. The feeling of my warmth excited me. I reached for it. It really was getting there. I was getting wet.</p> <p>I rubbed his cock. It was growing. My heart was beating pretty hard. It did kind of a flip-flop. My fingers felt so good. It didn't feel right with my hands in my shorts. When I felt his cock, I felt his cock getting harder and thicker. I felt his precum. His cock was getting ready to pop. I touched his cock and began to stroke it. He moaned a little.</p> <p>I began to fuck him. Very slowly at first. I knew that I was doing a good impression. The action in the chair was pretty exciting. He had a nice ass, big, but not full or chubby.</p> <p>"What do you like?" I said, trying to be polite.</p> <p>"Your hands on my cock."</p> <p>"Thank you," I said, moving forward and taking his shaft in my hands.</p> <p>He was big. I had to reach around his cock to hold it. It was definitely throbbing. I held it. I felt it harden and jerk a little. I tried to wrap my fingers around it, but it was so hard. I was scared, but that was not at all what made this so good.</p> <p>While I stroked him, I looked into his eyes and could see a little glimmer of lust. I had my little brother's hard cock in those eyes. I looked at him and could see the look in his eye, and my body tingled.</p> <p>"It's okay," I said. "You have always been able to do that for me. It's okay with you. But you're not my type."</p> <p>I went back to my hands on his cock and put it in my mouth. He moaned and he came just a little while I did.</p> <p>After he came, I gave it back to him. I sucked his cock again, and my mouth was a little full of his cum. There was even a little salty flavor. I liked it. I liked it.</p> <p>I was still working on his cock when I reached forward to take his cock between my thumb and finger. I was really hoping it would get hard again. I tried to be a gentleman and just held it.</p> <p>Then, he sat back on the couch. He leaned back and watched me and then said, "Damn, Candide, you really are a fucking hunk." He was kind of flustered.</p> <p>I looked up and saw him reaching out and grabbing his cock. He took it in his hand and began to stroke it.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I got this all the way through."</p> <p>"Your virgin," I said, then looked at him to see the big smile on his face.</p> <p>He grabbed his cock and gave it. "I sucked it back out pretty quickly.</p> <p>He went for a few more.</p> <p>Covered. I held someâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
