In the country of the Quadi at Granua, these. Betimes in the morning</h4><p><strong>say to thyself, This day I shalt have to do with an idle curious man, with an unthankful man, a railer, a crafty, false, or an envious man; an unsociable</strong> or unknown man, whose body I will possess and will serve until my dying day."</p> <p>Her mouth descended on his cock and was filled with a gasp of utter delight.</p> <p>"It is a very long, very long time, Your slut, that can scarcely wait to have the chance to do with it, to be fucked." Her eyes twinkled with desire. She stroked him a little, as her mouth sucked and licked its rigid, pulsating length. She kissed a drop of precum from his tip and licked it. "I think I shall now put you in my mouth where I can savor it to be savored."</p> <p>With her lips and tongue caressing him and her hand stroking and playing with his cock, he felt himself ready to climax.</p> <p>"Lick it, and suck it, and clean my prick, my slut." He was almost shaking with lust. "Lick it better because I have to be in its proper, respectable place soon, and I shall be cumming all over my slut's face." Her hands had now found their way to his balls, fondling them gently, massaging them from underneath. "You can put it in her mouth too. We shall see when I get there."</p> <p>His thoughts were in turmoil when her mouth engulfed and took in as much of his thick, meat as she could. Her lips tightened on the whole of him, sucking softly at first, then harder, taking his whole length. He thought he was going to die of joy.</p> <p>Once again she took him deep into her mouth, her fist stroking and twisting at his root, her mouth sucking him and milking him. She was sucking hard. Her lips were like a cock, it was like sucking a cock. He was going to blow in thirty seconds. If she continued, he would be gone. He wanted it in her face.</p> <p>This sight was too arousing for him, he wanted to go on. He wanted to blow his load on her face. Her hand slipped away from him and her hands did the job it had left in her fingers a moment ago. His eyes went wide and he saw that her body was taut but still soft, soft with every movement, he saw that there were no ridges on her skin anywhere. Her legs were wide open and her knees were raised for him, and she smiled. His hand rested on her thigh. His face was near and he could see her cunt glistening with juices. He could smell the scent. He looked at her from below and she looked back.</p> <p>"There now you see why I have to have a little break when you are done. Let's have another quickie, shallwey."</p> <p>Her lips parted and the wetness coated him. He felt himself grow slick but still hard. It was a struggle with trying to keep his eyes from looking up her body and that would do it. He could not stop himself. He wanted to look at her, but didn't want to get his eyes on the rest. He was afraid. She would know. He saw no reason to leave the room now or stay in it, but there had to be a reason why he was there.</p> <p>His face must have passed by into the darkness. He didn't want him to be in there alone, so he opened his eyes for one last look and felt that something was in his eyes.</p> <p>There, the light was coming from her cunt. He had a clear shot of her dark hair. The smell was familiar, yet it was gone. He watched as her labia opened. He saw the wetness there. He saw her opening him. His penis, hard, throbbing was in her hand again.</p> <p>She came. Hard. Her body tensed up and her cunt grasped at him. His head was thrown back. His back arched. He knew that he was going to shoot any second there too. He was about to cum as he watched it spurt from her as she rode out her orgasm.</p> <p>It was just one long climax. There were just one. A good climax. His head jerked up with a shout as he came for the seventh time. One long, intense climax. He wanted to tell her to stop, he knew it. He wanted her to stop. The world went on, as the sensations of his orgasm subsided. He lay there, in his own world, just enjoying the pleasures of his body, thinking about her.</p> <p>He had made a woman. She was beautiful. He wanted to be with her. He wanted to see, to feel, she was. He wanted to know, she was there in his arms. His body said "Yes, she's there," was there.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Her breath was there his mouth.,</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She</p> <p>He came</p> <p></p> <p>When heâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
