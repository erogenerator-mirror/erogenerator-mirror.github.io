The clerk’s lamp illumined his countenance. He held his hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat was carefully buttoned;</strong> his watch fit his thumb well enough; but, he was certainly aware his body could not be so easily manipulated by those of the opposite sex.</p> <p>'Why did I have to do this?' he wondered. It had been an ordeal. He hadn’t realized that his actions were so easy. “Why did I have to be so easy?” he wondered, aloud to himself. Perhaps I was thinking like an old man, he thought, as he had.</p> <p>At the mall I found that I was wearing some really sexy black leather bra and pantyhose beneath my blouse. It felt so good on my ass. That’s how my legs felt before the orgasm. It felt good, too. I looked at the leather pantyhose and decided that it should be crotch-less.</p> <p>I’d taken them off. My husband would find out. Maybe I would, too. “Oh God!” he thought. His fingers parted my pantyhose and he felt the fabric of my panties as well. He was so anxious for me that he started unbuttoning his coat so slowly. I was watching the door as he unbuttoned his coat and took off everything. He wasn’t wearing his hat; I could already see the outline of his lips on his lips. My pussy was aching like it never had in years.</p> <p>I slipped my hand through my panty hose and found that his cock was still hard. I couldn’t believe it. My pussy felt so soft and smooth and warm. There was only one thing that I wanted more than his cock. I wanted it inside me. I needed it. My hands caressed his chest. I wanted to feel his hands with mine. I wanted to wrap them around his neck, pull him closer, and fuck him, but I didn’t.</p> <p>The clerk at the desk asked him to sign the register. Then I told him to sit down. I took my handkerchief from my pocket and wrapped it around his cock. Once his cock had gotten nice and hard, I lowered my head and kissed it, and I held a drop of pre-cum on my tongue. I sucked his head and swallowed his whole length. He was so hard that it almost hurt. I continued to stroke him with one hand and the other hand in my breast. The more he moaned, the deeper I sucked his cock. I wanted all of it inside my mouth. I was determined to make him as happy as possible tonight and as often as I could.</p> <p>I continued to kiss his ear and his neck as I felt him getting even harder. I could feel the heat rising in his balls. If he couldn’t get back to the store, I was thinking the whole time, how could I leave him without getting him ready for tonight?</p> <p>I moved my head back to his ear so I could continue my assault on his cock. My tongue flicked across the lobe. I kissed it too, and felt it grow even harder. Then I heard him say, “My god!” to me. I slid my mouth off of his cock.</p> <p>“Oh my god, yes. Now get to work!” I said to him. I wanted his cock in my mouth. I kept licking it with my tongue, and I wanted to feel his cock inside my pussy. I felt his hand move from my breast to the back of my head. I could feel his cock hardening as the blood began to pump in it. He pulled my head back so he could get his cock back to the end of the desk. Then I felt he body lift from the desk and I felt it slide down my body, over, and into my wet pussy. The cold air that blew past it felt so good, I thought, “Oh my God. His cock felt so good on my clit and inside. I moved my feet back to allow it in. I was so wet and wide open that it felt like a soft, warm pussy with my clit-flesh on the end. I moved my hips while I felt the head of his cock touch me and spread my pussy wide. Then it filled me. I could feel it slide into me, and it could’ve ended up inside me. It didn’t hurt. There was just a little pain.</p> <p>I felt the clerk’s hand on my right leg as he opened my stocking and got his long fingers to work on my thigh. He was working his fingers toward the front of my leg when I felt the cold tip of the clerk’s hand on my exposed crotch, and I realized that he had pushed aside his boxers under my skirt so he would be able to touch me, too. I could have his hand in front, I was told him. It looked more like that he had opened my pussy.
