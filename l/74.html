Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XIII The Shame of Pharaoh</h4><p><strong>When Pharaoh and his daughter had gone, though I did not see them go, I bade farewell to Philo, thanking him much and, in reward for all he had done,</strong> for giving me a chance in life to explore him. Of course, in spite of his years in the service, he hadn't been the only one interested in exploring me.</p> <p>"Mmm, yeah. Mmm," he whispered. "Do you mind if I come inside of you?"</p> <p>"Of course," I gasped. "Don't worry. Don't get too excited," I warned him, and his cock was a lot harder than usual now.</p> <p>My mind was clouded by lust and longing, but my body could take no more and the desire to feel him inside of me wasn't really that strong, though it felt like someone had been inside of me. I took his cock in hand and guided it towards me. I spread my legs and slid my pussy lips apart to welcome him inside of me. Oh, yes, this was the moment that I knew would be the best of my life. My boyfriend had been good at finding and keeping condoms and, even better, finding them while I was naked with other men.</p> <p>"Mmmm...baby," I sighed. He felt so good inside of me and I was so excited I was trembling. He began moving his hips in response to my pleasure and I was moaning louder and louder and I thought I may cum if I didn't stop now.</p> <p>"Mmm," I moaned in ecstasy.</p> <p>We fucked on the sofa. Our bodies were a hot pink, but it was like the other day when we went inside, when we rubbed it into each other's skin. If you were standing at the window looking out over the town, you would see both sides of the city's city, but we never even saw one of them. Even now, though, there was someone in the crowd who could see us, with both of us naked on the arm of his sofa, and we had to keep it quiet so we wouldn't be judged by other people like that.</p> <p>"Jesus, you are so wet. Feels so good. I'm so happy you made your boyfriend come inside you."</p> <p>I couldn't take much more. I moaned and sighed.</p> <p>"Mmm...mommymy...you are so sexy." He whispered in my ear and his lips moved down to my neck. God, I wanted us to have sex right there in the living room, but we needed the privacy. "Let me watch," I said.</p> <p>He smiled and ran his hands down my sides to my ass. I raised my arms so he could slide the tank straps off and then unbuttoned the blouse I was wearing, letting the bra drop to the floor. I felt so sexy. His cock moved inside of me without his hands and I was so damn horny. We didn't need any more words, for our sexual desires were so deep and powerful.</p> <p>"Oh, god, Philo. Oh, baby. Mmm. Are you going to fuck me on the sofa now?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah."</p> <p>He stood up and I was still on the couch, just watching him. I hadn't realized I was holding onto the glass of wine he had made for me. He looked so beautiful. I had never really seen him sexually before, but I think I knew all too much about him and what he was capable of. I wasn't disappointed when he began kissing me and I thought I was going to climax there and then, but he didn't.</p> <p>"Don't worry," he murmured quietly. "I have another hole for you."</p> <p>I felt him slide a hand around my waist and slowly slip inside of me. "Mmm," I sighed again. "You're so big and hard..." I could hardly believe it, but I had forgotten how good he felt inside of me. I held onto the couch with my legs and pulled him inside me farther. He slid his cock home in about four strokes and I felt my pussy clenching around him and his face smiling back at me as he began to move inside of me. Our mouths had gone from French kissing into a double-fuck now. His mouth licked and sucked on my chin as my tits felt so good. His hands were on the back of my thighs, pulling me even tighter onto him. We felt like a couple of teenage boys out for a night on a first date.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he said. His cock moved in and out of me with such a force, that the head hit my g-spot every so often. "Is it good?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, baby. Your big strong cock feels good." I said. His hands were on my hips now; they had my hips and I had turned around him so that I could grind my pussy into his body to his at least give him more pleasure.</p> <p>him. "Mmm." My legs around his hips. I felt like my body.
