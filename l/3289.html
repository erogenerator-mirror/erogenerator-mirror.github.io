English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XXI. Voluntary Death.</h4><p><strong>In regard to this discourse, I should only like to point out that Nietzsche had a particular aversion to the word “suicide”—self-murder. He disliked the evil it suggested, and in</strong> particular the phrase, “Kill the bastard so he’s less likely to survive?” This notion I had not fully understood before but which is now now quite readily known. Nevertheless, Nietzsche is not exactly evil. If I read Nietzsche correctly, then I shall read Nietzsche for all time, I might as well get him drunk at midnight, then he’ll make sure his eyes start to close and pass out again like it just did.</p> <p>But the thing that I should not have done had caused me pain. The last time I had to die was probably nine years before when the great depression and depression of the 1930’s hit and the depression itself started to affect people. The people were very angry with all the violence and the damage those acts had done to people. The people were angry with the violence because they felt it gave them false hope. The people were angry because they knew that the violence had to do something good to save humanity and for that purpose, the violence would have to be of a greater proportion than the violence itself.</p> <p>I did not know the nature of the violence, nor the cause for it, or of what that violence actually did, but certainly it was not for the purposes we so deeply admire, but I also knew that, once again, Nietzsche was a philosopher.</p> <p>As I write this, I could not write much of a philosophical discussion. But, at the same time, I do hope I will have the time. But I shall not, because, for the moment, I shall simply write a story, and, since I shall never tell it to anyone ever again, I will write a nice romantic or sexual story. Perhaps I shall even write a sexual fantasy about a relationship with an old boyfriend whose sex is so good that it makes my sex life so good that I give out the word to the readers that I have written a nice romantic.</p> <p>All in all, this should be a pleasant writing experience, if you like erotic romance books of all things. Thanks for reading. - - - - - - - - - - -—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
