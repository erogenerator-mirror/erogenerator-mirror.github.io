The Deck.</h4><p><strong>The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of</strong> paper.</p> <p></p> <p>I saw her sitting on my lap, staring up at me in the mirror. I had a small erection, but there was no way I wanted to break my gaze. "Do you want to do this, Daddy?"</p> <p>I smiled. She was wearing this one black dress that was made of two thin triangles, barely covering her breasts, at the back of the neckline. The two pieces of clothing were held within the two edges, and only the tips of her boobs were covered. She had dark brown hair falling in soft curls down one side of her face. She spoke; for a reason. "I didn't think we'd meet. Do you like?"</p> <p>I kissed her lips. She melted into me. We kissed, the kiss taking possession of our souls. "Yes. I love you too." I was glad we decided to meet since I hoped I could see her in the mirror for hours. Because she was so beautiful. I loved what I saw, looking at the sight of her, with a little smile on my face.</p> <p>I was wearing a blue shirt with sleeves and collar, and a pair of khakis along with a t-shirt of my own, under a buttoned-off blue button-down shirt, and black sneakers. I had even worn black socks because the winter was cold when I drove down to Los Angeles. When I pulled into her driveway, I smiled at her. "How about another kiss like that."</p> <p>She smiled and pulled away as I put my left arm around her waist and kissed her left breast; the skin on her breast shone under my lip. I opened my mouth and slowly drew her nipple between my lips; the tip of her nipple was stiff and shiny and warm. She smiled and sucked my lower lip while I suckled her tit.</p> <p>She was wearing a black, sheer top that only barely kept her left nipple covered by the thin elastic fabric that was so thin that her breasts were outlined. "Is this okay," she asked. I was just wearing a plain white shirt, a red tie, and black boxers, not too tight, but enough to show an ample bulge.</p> <p>"Perfect. The more the merrier."</p> <p>I smiled at my baby. I pulled her towards me, and she leaned her head against the headrest of my seat just like I did when we ate dinner when I went to bed. I could see a lot of her boobs moving through the thin fabric of her top as opposed to just her hard nipples. I licked my lips.</p> <p>The house was silent; we were just watching each other as much as we were watching the movie playing on the big screen TV above my bed. It was not a movie of a movie. It was the movie of two teenagers together in the moment before prom.</p> <p>I kissed her again as she ran her fingers through my hair. I lifted on her right knee, and kissed it while she rubbed her knee against the bottom of my head. She was wearing a black dress that looked fantastic on her as it had when she was younger. It seemed to cling to her body and made me feel sexy. As soon as I started to go higher on her leg, she slipped her hand into the waistband of my boxers and pulled me into her. She was warm and wet against me. As her tongue probed my mouth, I could feel her hand on my cock. She slowly stroked it while I kissed and rubbed my cheek with her other hand.</p> <p>She had an idea that I was just waiting for a new time. "Let's go to my room," she smiled, as she stood up and moved back toward her side of the car.</p> <p>"But—" I protested.</p> <p>She smiled, knowing something could happen. I got out of the car, and she followed, a slight quiver in her step. I kissed her neck as she bent to remove her heels, and then pulled up the skirt of her dress as she sat down. We stopped right at her door, and she pulled the skirt high enough that I could see down into her stocking tops and the pink silk of her panties; it was a sight that I still can't believe my daughter looked so damn sexy in.</p> <p>After I turned around and gave a little kiss, I walked over to her, and lifted her by her hips. "Now take me to my room." I kissed her one more time before pulling her into the house, followed by her upstairs. I walked over to the window and smiled; the moonlight was warm on her face. She looked at me with a smile. "Daddy, is this okay?"</p> <p></p> <p>I kissed her lips to the mouth; letting my hands slowly.</p> <p></p> <p>she to take as</p> <p>I love my</p> <p>be to run</p> <p>as the s< your t through it a</p> <p>ever</p> <p>< f—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
