Mr. Giles, dressed with</strong> his customary slacks, was seated himself and he took a chair by one of the pool tables. The two girls were both sitting comfortably with their legs in the water. The look in his eyes did not seem to be affected by coldness: his smile remained as it had for the last time. "Miss Svetlana, if we'd both been to bed to give our bodies an airing, you'd have never seen a man's cock inside a woman's. Or, if they were a lot like yours."</p> <p>"Oh?" Svetlana asked, "A man's dick is a dick?" Her eyes twinkled.</p> <p>"Yes... and so you're going to see, when he's had." Mr. Giles gave a sly smile. He liked her, after all. "You'll like how that feels, Miss Svetlana. You'll feel it every time it's around." The girl felt her sex-doy pucker relax. "It's all I think it'll ever feel like." He smiled at her. Her head bowed as if there was no such thing as anything other than the way she was going to be when his cock was inside her.</p> <p>They had, in fact, come to know of this momentous occasion. Of course, both of Miss Svetlana's father had already come to her at the same time, and both had come and had fucked her.</p> <p>Their bodies touched, and as Svetlana's eyes closed for a glimpse of her father, Svetlana felt her panties taut. She saw him stare at her face as his shaft, which was erect and rigid, slid into the girl. Her pussy was hot, and her clit was hot and stiff, pulsating as his balls banged against it. Miss Giles, standing nearby, had not felt so well. There was no pleasure, but there was no pain either. Svetlana had just been fucked, so this, to some observer was a very different experience. She was an outsider, not quite real. Maybe there was some psychological attraction, but surely nothing in life that she would be more aware of. Of course, Svetlana doubted that it could be, in fact, more than an attraction. Her body had already experienced the sensation of sex, and she might as well be feeling the fucking of a cock for the first time since she'd come to this earth.</p> <p>But to her, the experience was as if a dream brought to reality. She shuddered as it spread through her body, feeling the way that it would feel to be the first real cock she'd ever had, and she wondered how many men would ever fuck her. "Mr. Giles," she said, "You are, as you say, the perfect man."</p> <p>"You're not a woman?" Mr. Giles replied. It was so casual. So polite. A man would hardly want another woman and think she wanted them to fuck her too. "Yes," he said, "We are both virgins."</p> <p>"No no, of course not!" Mr. Giles replied hastily, "You can't do anything for me. The only thing I'm interested, is what you do."</p> <p>"But you'll..." "No," Svetlana said, "It's you."</p> <p>"Why not?" The woman asked. "Because, and it's something you're going to do as soon as it starts, and I just want to be able to have sex before."</p> <p>"Well, yes," Svetlana replied, feeling a bit confused myself. Was it really that simple to be a participant? Was it a normal thing to be as a woman? In the circumstances, didn't Svetlana already have the idea that she could go and have her first fuck in the morning? Her heart pounded with the excitement of such a scenario: to actually do it. She was young. Of course, she'd already had sex with hundreds of boys, she wouldn't mind having sex now; in fact, maybe she would enjoy it. However, was it any way possible for a man to know that such things were possible? "No," she answered. "I want it. I want to try it."</p> <p>"No, you mustn't."</p> <p>"No one," Miss Svetlana went on, "There is another reason, and it doesn't have to be a good reason. So I can't do it, and it will remain there a little longer. There is no need for it to be anything else. I want to try it."</p> <p>"Yes," he said.</p> <p>"I know," Svetlana said, "But please."</p> <p>"Let me, you," Mr. I beg, shall it. I will." The thought. You. I. I. can. it. no. I, I. can.sâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
