Tragedies were at first brought in and instituted, to put men in mind</h4><p><strong>of worldly chances and casualties: that these things in the ordinary course of nature did so happen: that men that were much pleased and delighted by such accidents upon this</strong> planet had no regrets, and had no guilt; and that men had enjoyed things they had wished or prayed for.</p> <p>In this way, all that was wrong was what it was. But that was not wrong at all; that was the purest of all. Or so men had said: because they were good at their craft, and they believed in themselves, and they were the best, because, well, it is the truth with which they were chosen."</p> <p>The words of Rana's mind would have made it sound ludicrous, but, what could she say? They were very true, and that did not change their position or beliefs; but it made even more sense, as if, now, it was indeed true: it was the truth of the matter, and not just some stupid, stupid-on-their-trot cycle which led us to be in trouble.</p> <p>"In a nutshell, we don't have a lot of experience; and, so, the chances of a man and woman having intercourse, I think, or getting into a relationship just depends on how well you go, and how well your sex life goes. When sex happens, some say 'might do well go in', and some say 'might want sex to really.' So, that's what we are about to say."</p> <p>"So, are you saying that we can, like, have sex or not? Or, are you saying that we don't have much experience? Or, do we have something like an 'I'm a virgin.' or something like that?" Rana had been confused by the question, but she'd had no reason to be. She was just trying to imagine what it would be like: how men would see it, be happy to take a girl that might not be a virgin into bed, and let it happen! She didn't take into account that she herself had had intercourse already. And there was the fact that she didn't know how she had got into bed with a girl, a girl whom she had even had the pleasure of having sex with before!</p> <p>"No, there's no such thing, I guess. We have no expectations, really," he said. "You just have to enjoy yourself, and trust that your man will go along with it."</p> <p>"So, do you think..." Rana had the word 'go along' in her mind, "that we should talk more about this whole fucking thing than a woman?" She didn't have an answer to the question.</p> <p>"Rana, the real thing is what it's like, and that is what it's all about to become," he said.</p> <p>Rana looked at him and nodded. "If I was a little scared and uncertain, I'll leave. But, it's all right for you, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Sure, but you know, not many guys are gonna go through the stuff of the 'trot cycle thing': that's what the 'trot cycle' thing's about. It's mostly about the guy doing stuff; you've got to make up for it, don't you?"</p> <p>Rana nodded again. "In a lot of ways, yes," she said, "it's a lot, too. I hope it won't be the first time in my life that I did something that I hadn't done, that I shouldn't. And I hope, like, if this was the right time, it's a good, long time, before I'll need to get myself off again.</p> <p>"But what about when you said you've had sex before, even before you got over it: what does that mean?"</p> <p>"Let's say, 'Well, you've had sex before, haven't you?' Of course I've had sex before, as a girl. I didn't really notice it before! I didn't think of it like it was anything like that... but even so, I do kind of, I don't recall feeling guilty about it. You know about the times we've had, and I guess that I would have had the same reaction if I had gone on a date with somebody else. You know, the first time you were with a girl at the time, and you wanted to have sex with me. After that, you weren't really sure how it happened; and after that, it didn't take me long to figure it out.</p> <p>"I started with the way I felt when I had it with someone; the first time with a girl, a girl your age. Now, I'm more sure of things. That's what I want to be right, isn't it, Rana?" I nodded, and he said, "Well, you can be absolutely right about anything, yes--but not in this case you say that you're not be right about it as much."</p> <p>--and that you are not like this, or something you, and that it's not that andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
