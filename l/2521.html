For example, if I Covenant to pay a ransome, or service for my life, to an enemy;</strong> to pay for my wife's infidelity; to pay for your wife's marriage; to fuck your wife (which includes any and all). All non-members are welcome to take me up on my offer.</p> <p>And now it is time to fuck. I am going to have sex with a hot young stud. The most fantastic thing about sex with you is that you can fuck and never leave me unsatisfied. So if you are into fucking then I have the keys to unlock the doors of my office. I'm at this time of day, and I want to fuck a hot eighteen-year-old; just as much as you want me to fuck. For those of you who love to fuck, wait until July. It will start very early and then your old fashioned, 'No fucking, no getting, or you'll lose your job'. In other words, unless someone can give you a good time, you're gonna get fucked more than you can handle. Trust me, it will be so much better than the first and only time we do it.</p> <p>You know what I like to fantasize about during an episode? That's where I do it!</p> <p>When a man has an enormous cock: the cock is not only huge but also it is long and thick. It's about 14 inches long and thick. It's the biggest cock I've ever seen or felt in my life. It's as thick as my arm and almost twice the length. I just keep fantasizing about how it feels to stroke it, to stroke it, to stroke it and then to fuck it.</p> <p>I enjoy stroking it. That's why I write about it. I don't want to waste or spoil the joys and pleasures of having large, thick, fat, long thick, hard-on. I don't want you to feel left out or guilty.</p> <p>Anyway, if you have ever done one of these things to a guy, then I recommend you try it once. You need to have a warm and wet, willing pussy. A guy can lay on his back, or on his stomach, without having to go down on him. I'm sure he can get his cock inside you. If there is a condom on it, he can fuck your naked ass until it's sore from the exertion. He'll even be able to fuck you with it. I guarantee that.</p> <p>If you are a guy with a massive cock, there is another place that I think you should take it for your personal enjoyment, where you can just lay there and enjoy the feeling as it goes in and out of your pussy. If you have ever done it to a woman, there is something that you really love about having it all the way up inside your pussy. It's much easier for you to hold onto it when it's deep inside you than if it's in your pussy, but once it's in and all the way in you enjoy the feeling. When you've had it in you for a while, you'll get used to it a lot easier and you'll start to enjoy it more. I have no doubt that you'll enjoy it even more if you enjoy it as much as you do when you've been with a man.</p> <p>Some guys like when you can't hold on for more than once. Other guys like me know this for what it is, and I know exactly what you mean by "once it's in, you'll be able to keep going and enjoying every second of it." Personally, I'd never done it, but if you want to go for it, the feeling will be all yours.</p> <p>When a guy has a cock, he likes to have his balls licked, and he loves to have his lips pressed against his scrotum, and his tongue licking his sac, it is important to have lots of saliva on your fingers, on your tongue, wherever your tongue goes. It's what makes it so much more pleasurable to have all your fingers in your pussy. It allows you to just play with your pussy hairs and just press the head of it against the slit.</p> <p>That sounds like it's what you like to see. A cock is just that, a cock. That's the ultimate expression of masculine sexuality. It can be any cock you like. It can be a man's cock, a man's dick, a man's cock, a man's cock, a big cock; that's the sexual expression that men share, which they say is as true as it is between women. That's where it makes sense to start, right?</p> <p>When it's all in your hand, you can just feel the texture of a cock under your palm. A guy's cock feels soft and warm. A guy's cock feels wet. They feel sexy and hard, when it's hot because it is all together. The sensation of a guy's the way up inside a woman makes you or down the end of a woman's way when it's wayâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
