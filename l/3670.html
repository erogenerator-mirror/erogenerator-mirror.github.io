Her personal time at the Mansion House was to make herself very very rich before she left in six months' worth of her life; but, at least there she would have her own place to live, and to make that house very comfortable as a bedroom for him and for herself; the way things would be made. It would be the perfect and very perfect house. It would never be lonely for him at all. And it would always be a perfect and very special house, with a wonderful fireplace, great music and a beautiful and perfect bed for him to spend the rest of his life with. There would never be a place, a time to live as an individual, or as a couple, or a relationship, that wasn't wonderful, nor would there ever be a place, a time, where nothing could ever be as fantastic as what they were experiencing right now.</p> <p>With a smile that was as big as her entire heart and just as wide as her entire naked body, it was the happiest day of her life. Now, once again, she was happily married, and, once again, she was living her life alone and without all that money involved; and when she saw his beautiful eyes looking up at her from above all that time ago; she smiled too. This was only a moment ago; and now, as if she had already been so happy to see him when he arrived to take her home; she had her first ever visit to a handsome and desirable man, someone who she would always remember, and someone she would always cherish, while waiting to do the same for herself.</p> <p>"What do you mean you like it up in there?" she said to Mikey while she was already smiling. "Well, I've never heard anybody like you and it's been so fun."</p> <p>"Are you kidding me?" he asked. "Well, yes, definitely. You have such an amazing home. I had the best looking bed in the best place on campus. And, I really love your taste in clothing, so I can tell you're wearing a pair of very sexy things."</p> <p>"That's true. Of course, it's only because I had the best taste of everything in my entire life too, and I have these very sexy little things!" Jen said, while reaching down to unbutton her dress all the way while removing it all the way and laying it aside.</p> <p>"Wow! You've got such a wonderful house. I love it," he said, smiling up at her while admiring her and feeling her body.</p> <p>"Thank you so much. It's just that, I had some money of my own and my job didn't last long enough for me to be able to afford a place to stay. But, for once, I decided to come up with some money," she replied, and after removing her bra and panty set, she then began to remove her skirt and panties with her other hand; and after a moment of hesitation, she looked at him waiting for him to give her a choice.</p> <p>"Would you make me a list of the things you're going to be wearing down here, Jen?" he asked her. "I already know the ones you're going to be wearing. So, you'll have to start at the bottom and work your way up," he said.</p> <p>"No that's okay," she said while still standing and removing her dress and panties and leaving them in a pile at her feet. "I'll do my best without having to take them off too much. Right now they're still stuck with me in my underwear," she said while smiling, while lying down on a bed sheet, while slowly spreading her legs to show off her gorgeous legs and her beautiful body, and when she was lying on her back when she had only half of her panties on, she spread her legs open and she was still wearing one of the most beautiful and sexiest pair of panties and a very sexy bra she owned, which she had been wearing for a very long time.</p> <p>"And," Mikey continued. "There are things I can do that you can do that you won't, like wear a lot of buttons and stuff, like buttoning up your blouse and looking at your bras and your undies and your dresses and your bras, and maybe even a lot of buttons on your shirt, and a lot of pretty bras, and a lot of pretty bras and sexy bras," she laughed while smiling. "maybe even wearing a lot of pretty bras, pretty bras, pretty things aspen undies."</p> <p></p> <p>"Jen smiled and colored, pretty bras and sweet and sexy and pretty panties," she said.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh yes as she just made her, pretty and sexy," she smiled.</p> <p>just a moment."</p> <p>"I smiled—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
