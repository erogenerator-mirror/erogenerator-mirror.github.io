The shadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him when he closed</strong> the door to his office. A long time fantasy crept into his mind, about a man with a long, fat penis and a thick, hairy bush, but he didn’t expect a man to really fuck him.</p> <p>After a quick lunch he went back to his house to read some books, which were now gone. After that he returned to his study, in the middle of the night, and he found the library door unlocked. He was shocked to see a man and a woman in a full grown manor together. Both were in their mid thirties and quite attractive. His thoughts drifted to that night when he was in his office.</p> <p>Stephen walked along the wall, his head spinning with the memory. He was startled when his wife Jane stopped behind him. It was early in the evening and they had a party to attend. Stephen didn't really know what to do, but he still had no idea what to think. Jane’s hands found the buttons on his shirt. His heart raced, as if he was fighting the urge to rip off the shirt. His pants finally were unzipped and Jane pulled down his underwear and revealed his manhood. “Oh, you are so beautiful,” she whispered in his ear. Stephen felt the manhood come out of his clothing. Jane lifted his wife's skirt and pulled up her panties. He gasped when a large penis popped out of the folds of his wife’s panties. “Oh, God,” he moaned as the penis moved back and forth between her legs. Stephen was sure that he would be unable to continue his fantasy. Jane pulled down her panties and stood in front of Stephen. He reached underneath himself. His fingers came out with a large drop of precum that oozed from his hole. Stephen lifted his wife’s skirt high and she removed her underwear. She lifted her ass from the sofa. Stephen took his wife’s panties to his face and breathed in the scent of her. “Oh, yes,” he whispered as his tongue flicked across his wife’s clitoris. Stephen’s tongue danced across Jane’s clitoris, as if he never had before. He was a real expert on eating pussy...but he needed his wife to come. He moved his mouth off her pussy. It was the first time he had tasted anything other than pussy. He wondered if it would taste as good on his tongue. He looked up at Jane. “Oh, God, Steve. I wanted this to be just like you, as a man. I feel like a virgin to you now.” Jane stood up and threw her bra at Steve who gasped and turned around, catching the bra in his hands. Jane unbuttoned his shirt, revealing a muscular chest covered with black hair. She pulled off Stephen just long enough for him to pull off her panties. Stephen gasped when his wife’s pubic hair tickled his face. His dick began stiffening and he rubbed it against his wife’s mound. Jane pushed Stephen’s head downwards. Stephen’s mouth closed around his wife’s clit and sucked it. He was sure he would come soon.</p> <p>Stephen’s tongue teased the clitoris. It was soft and swollen. He felt the muscles in her thighs twitch. It felt good to have her. He looked up at Jane. She pulled down her skirt. “This feels good. I wish the tongue was more than that.”</p> <p>Stephen was in ecstasy. Jane’s tongue danced across his dick. He felt in heaven. Stephen sucked and licked her clit. Jane’s tongue flicked at his hole. It felt so good. He began to suck lightly, as his wife’s tongue flicked across his dick. Stephen sucked. He imagined that it was Jane’s tongue doing this to him. He felt his climax approaching.</p> <p>Jane slid a finger into Stephen’s ass. His stomach was tightening with his approaching climax. This time, he came. His semen shot up and out of Jane’s pussy. Stephen was aware that he was holding the penis between his lips. Jane brought Stephen towards her. Stephen came hard. Jane brought him to his feet.</p> <p>“I’m so glad you came out with no underwear. I like your dick better than you cock. Maybe we can experiment?” Jane smiled. That made Stephen do something in return. It made Stephen want to fuck Jane more.</p> <p>Jane and Stephen walked back to Stephen’s bedroom. ’ house. Stephen’ were a secret society. ”. She looked at Stephen’s the man.</p> <p>’ body again.
