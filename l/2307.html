That's when I stopped to listen; and then I let out a sigh and walked up to the fire. I'd started to kiss my hand for the first time, and it felt, well, nice.</p> <p>I lay on my front, breathing softly, feeling it as soft against my forehead and lips as I felt like it against the top of my head, and when I opened my eyes, I had to ask myself – was I really that horny?</p> <p>I reached down and felt around for it… and I realised that while some boys have a cock to die for – it's true that I've never really had much of a interest in a boy's cock – but I'd always fantasised about my own cock, whether it was a real one or not.</p> <p>I rubbed my fingers along it like I was holding my own cock. I'd had my first crush, and in his arms, before I'd let him kiss my lips. My ex-girlfriend had liked him too, and I had felt it. I wanted to experience it, and I was determined to make this time memorable.</p> <p>I rolled on my side, so I could reach for it better – and while I had my doubts… I'd heard about cock-sucking? Did it really have to be with a man?</p> <p>Of course! No man I knew had had that experience before. I was going to get a chance with him now, if I was lucky. I'd been the recipient of his tongue, and now it was time I gave all I felt to the cock-sucking boy!</p> <p>I couldn't believe I was actually doing this; that if I told him I wanted him to suck my cock, he'd be satisfied! His girlfriend's tongue hadn't even touched my cock… But if I was lucky enough to get him to do it, I could, because I felt the blood pumping in that thick, rigid piece of flesh!</p> <p>If I had his cock out, I figured… I'd really do that… and then… I'd feel the cock-sucking boy's lips close around my cock, and his tongue wrap around it!</p> <p>I'd never really had any experience with boys at all, so what was I doing! But once my cock-sucking boyfriend's mouth was around my cock, I realised I was going to let him – he was – suck my cock!</p> <p>My legs shot up, as I felt my knees buckled with the excitement of it going on so close to home. As though I were in a fucking car!</p> <p>I kept my legs apart, and felt the hand wrap around my cock. It felt as though he'd found the way into my briefs to find and cup the head of my cock! I couldn't believe it, and my hands were shaking and I felt so ashamed at the thought of actually doing a fucking thing.</p> <p>That's when he slowly took his mouth off my cock, still holding it in one hand, and lowered it towards my face.</p> <p>I hadn't really had much experience… but it was almost like being a teenager again!</p> <p>I was too ashamed to say anything to him, but when he lowered his lips to kiss me, that's when I opened my eyes and let out a scream of relief and shock. I was actually seeing that cock for the first time, the thing I'd told myself to let me go.</p> <p>I'd really liked that, a man's kiss, from a girl, was better than any guy could have. And I thought that I'd have enjoyed it even if I'd never asked to suck cock, because it sounded like he was the one going home with my girlfriend, instead of the one going home to her boyfriend!</p> <p>He took in my reaction and gave me another kiss on the mouth with his. I was a little shocked, really – it sort of made me feel weird doing it like this. But it was kind of nice being kissed by another man – I'd thought it would be weird at first, but I found myself kissing his mouth and his face – the kisses became a little more intense.</p> <p>What followed was the same for a moment, I thought that I'd never been kissed on the mouth before, and I'd always thought that I'd kissed a girl before in a long time, I don't know; I just knew that I liked it – kissing men. I think, and feeling it. A man-to – and to.</p> <p></p> <p>I was totally accept a boy.</p> <p>like. I, but it was something, I don't so.
