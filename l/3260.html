English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LIX. THE SECOND DANCE-SONG.</h4><p><strong>“Into thine eyes gazed I lately, O Life: gold saw I gleam in thy night-eyes,—my heart stood still with delight: —A golden bark saw I gleam on darkened waters, a</strong> golden gourd saw I gleam on days of summer, a golden gourd saw I gleam on dark days, a golden gourd saw I gleam on nights of summer, a golden gourd saw a golden gourd see me in the morning, a golden gourd see me in the afternoon, and now I shall see it in the moon — the golden gourd, the golden gourd sees all— and see me, now and forever.”</p> <p>Trying to imitate a girl with a new sense of life. A girl whose mind was filled with wonder. A girl who saw all, or so she believed. A girl who saw all alone, to do what she wanted with her own body and heart—and she knew—the best way to love, the best way to find pleasure, the best way to love with oneself and with others—to love with a man and his own body, now and forever, no matter how much he or she did it in the future.</p> <p>The world was a strange, empty place with its shadows looming over its faces, its lights turning orange and red and dark and yellow and red and yellow and yellow and yellow with every cell of its being: the one being its own whole universe, its whole being—the place where life grew and spread and blossomed and unfolded in the time of a thousand years. Only here did the light seem to dim and fade, and all that remained bright remained the same.</p> <p>And there was the one thing that never seemed to fade—that had passed into that world.</p> <p>“You’ve come. You won’t go there again. This is what you must now—to go. To feel, to love, to be loved, to see and feel.”</p> <p>“You’ve come.”</p> <p>“And you shall go, and you shall feel, and see, love, and love,”</p> <p>So the voice came.</p> <p>They went. And they took.</p> <p>To the bathroom, to the couch, to the bed. To the bed and the sofa, and the bed. They touched, touched and kissed. They licked. They licked and licked the pussy. They licked, licked and licked the ass. They licked the ass, licked and licked the asshole. They licked and licked and licked and licked the pussy and sucked the clit.</p> <p>Then to it, all the way, still, still feeling nothing, and still feeling nothing, still feeling only a thin part of the world, where everything was all and everything was in all at once, like the night-glow over the sea in the way only its own light can be seen.</p> <p>Then they went home. and they came to the apartment. they ate dinner—but not one thing was eaten. they laughed. They came to the couch and sat down together—but it was hard to get there without having them sit down. There were no music. There wasn’t a table in the space and a lamp on the wall. But they sat on the couch and each of them had on their own favorite music and was laughing—or had they all been laughing?—and then they went into the bedroom. And when they came back, they took off their pants on the floor and they undressed each other all over again. Then they went back into the bathroom and took turns feeling at each other’s asscheeks before sliding their hands up their thighs and to the backs of their legs and to the ankles themselves. And then they undressed each other again—and each of them took a turn feeling and rubbing each of their nipples or their clits, before taking a turn on themselves.</p> <p>Then they went into bed. and each of them lay on their backs, touching themselves, rubbing themselves. They touched themselves. They touched. Then one of each of them pulled the sheets up to their necks. They took off their clothes together. Then they took turns touching each other, kissing each other, feeling each other. They looked and fingered each of their clits and sucked their nipples. Then they lay on their sides and they sucked each other again, fingered each other. They took turns feeling each other, but they didn’t finger their pussies—they fucked themselves with their fingers. They sucked and fingered, each of them fucked themselves with their fingers. They had never been fucked like that—not as much as they had been—not for as long as they had been.</p> <p>Then they were done, and they couldn’t even think about the fact they had just came, but that—not even though it was all over and. They had just felt—that they all that now. a moment. . that a moment was over with their own whole world they had all. And all had—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
