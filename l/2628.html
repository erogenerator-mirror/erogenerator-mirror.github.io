For it has been already shewn, that nothing</strong> ever happens until it is too late. We can't even expect that these modern years are over because I have never been a believer.</p> <p>My story begins a year ago. It was my senior year in college, a year of my life. I had gotten into the party scene, and after about one party, went to meet my girlfriend of the year. Well, I was out of high school, but even still, that was a small price to pay for a future. To say I was a virgin would be an understatement. My girlfriend was a virgin, and my experience with sex, was a lot like mine. I don't know why we didn't share everything before, and now I am going to share it with the world. And you got nothing to worry about, either, except you are not going to know sex, if it doesn't work out, yet.</p> <p>Anyway, she was a very popular girl, and when she started dating me, it became sort of a routine. Whenever I would come home with food, I would put on a special pair of boxer shorts that did nothing but provide a layer of hide-and-seek, and go through the motions of a night of lustful lovemaking. I would lay naked on top of her, caressing her breasts, while she rubbed her pussy into my groin. At times, she would be begging me to go down, but of course, I wouldn't.</p> <p>After my first night, the party had to end, because my girlfriend was on her way out of town, and the end of the party would have to come next. One of my girlfriends, who had a boyfriend, was there, not wanting to be there, because a girlfriend is never going to be home anyway. When I looked around for her, she was at my dorm room (her roommate had moved out). I went home, and after a couple hours of studying, just when I had lost my virginity, she called me. We talked for a while. I didn't know what to do, and I'm sure she knew. She had a smile about her, and she had never seen me like this with anyone. All I knew was that, if anything, she was the hottest girl I knew. I started to be uncomfortable with the conversation, because she was so beautiful, but then I noticed something in her.</p> <p>For my eighteenth birthday, she told me that she was a virgin all her life. To give that to me, she had to take the last test. This was a very rare event, for I had always felt that we shouldn't lose our virginity with everyone else who was there, even though I never told her that I was bisexual. The only one who knew that it wasn't me she was kissing would be the one she was talking about. I felt that she wasn't ready to take the chance, but she did it anyway. This was what she did. I guess my girlfriend knew from first hand experience that I was bisexual. I didn't know that it was even something anymore. At my age, I didn't have to ask. All I had to do for her to understand. At first, she just kissed on the cheek, then on her lips. She was a beautiful girl, and the first one I saw that made me think that she was someone I could be with. We went to the party, dancing, singing, and getting hot. It was incredible. When I kissed her on the cheek, I could feel her shivering a little.</p> <p>After our date that night she invited me to her room. She said that I would be alone with her. "Please, don't be disappointed in me," I whispered to myself, "I think that you would be interested in my body". I thought it sounded pretty sweet.</p> <p>I was about to leave to go home when she whispered in my ear. "Let's go upstairs", she said "and then up to your room". I thought that was perfect, because now was my first opportunity to know her properly. And I was definitely interested. So without any resistance, I followed her to her room. She opened the door, and immediately I was immediately stripped of clothes. I felt completely naked in the hall, completely in charge of myself; I couldn't have told you that this was the first time I had ever been so fully naked in the presence of someone else. I went to her bed, and laid down on my back on top of it. I thought that I could fall asleep on her bed if we were standing over it. I didn't fall asleep. I got up to my room.</p> <p>I thought I would fall asleep by myself, when I saw that she had already been naked. There, and was getting undressed.</p> <p>Then, there, I was a picture. We were naked on her bed, kissing, lying in her bed.</p> <p>I got my hands She was on bed.
