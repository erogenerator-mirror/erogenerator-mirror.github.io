It is high time for thee, to understand that there is somewhat in</h4><p><strong>thee, better and more divine than either thy passions, or thy sensual appetites and affections. What is now the object of my mind, is it fear, or suspicion, or lust,</strong> or desire, or need. In one movement on my back, legs up high over my head, and knees open wide. I feel I have complete faith in thee. I feel thee begin to move in me and my pussy begins to ache. My pussy was not used for days. My wetness seeps down upon thighs. I am in ecstasy. I want thee inside, and I am going to take.</p> <p>We both begin with slow movements, like a ballet. My breasts sway in rhythm with the music. The bed slides up into me. I wrap one arm around thy back and pull it tight in my groin. I can feel my pussy swell and expand around thee’s cock until it feels as if it would burst from thee in the heat and sensation. I reach forward and lift thee just enough so that I can feel my clit rubbing upon thy pelvis on every thrust. I can feel I have taken a child inside of me. My pussy pulses against thee’s rod.</p> <p>We can feel the bed dip into the depths. we can see thee reach between us and grasp my clit. I moan softly so as not to cause thy own orgasm to overwhelm us both. I feel my own cum begin to move through my body. The orgasm, is wonderful. The passion, and the rapture of bliss overwhelms me. I begin to breathe harder and faster. I am lost in my love. I feel thee begin to move into more of a rhythm, moving more urgently inside of my wetness.</p> <p>I know it is time. I begin to feel myself losing control. I begin to cum. My muscles tighten around thee and my pussy walls grip thee hard. I moan the joy of thy pleasure inside of me. I feel it as though i am going to pass out. I am a woman, in the presence of thee, who has only given herself. The feeling, as thou bring me into being and I am a woman. I am a woman who has given herself. I feel the release. I have surrendered to thee. The pleasure fills the room. I am exhausted.</p> <p>The passion, and power, are so strong that it is difficult for me to fall into a sleep. I wake to my smell filling the night, as thou sleep upon me. My body was wracked with the after shocks of pleasure, which have never before been so pleasurable. I know that once done, I would pass out in bliss. I know that when I have finished thee, my body would be as it had ever been.</p> <p>I lay on thy chest and let our emotions and bodies continue for just a little. I can feel thee’s heart beating in rhythm with mine.</p> <p>To be continued—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
