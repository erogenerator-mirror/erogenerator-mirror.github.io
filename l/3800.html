But as I reached out into the</strong> back of my head, I noticed the keys had been lying on the cold, dry ground somewhere. Curious, I leaned over and picked up the keys. They were no ordinary keys. I opened the door, carefully lifted the keys from the ground, and then carefully placed them on the stone floor and watched as the world below fell away.</p> <p>**************</p> <p>Time: December 12, 2006 1:32 AM Subject: How the hell am I supposed to sleep with you?</p> <p>I looked over at you, sitting on the bed. "I sleep with a guy, I really do..."</p> <p>"No! I mean..." you broke off, embarrassed at your own admission. "It's just, um... that, you know..."</p> <p>I didn't want to say it. I didn't want to take that chance, however, especially since you had already made yourself so vulnerable. I wanted to say something else. I thought about what you would do to me if I would just give up. I knew you wanted me to give up. I could feel it in my own cock through my pants. I'd love to have your sweet lips around my cock while you slowly stroked yourself for me, but I had to tell you first. I didn't want to scare you off. I was still a little bit ashamed to have to admit this way, but even more, it seemed as though it was easier for you than doing it herself. I had already convinced myself that if I gave in to you now, that it wouldn't bother me once you would be ready, and that if you didn't I wouldn't. I figured I should just go along with this and just forget about it. But you made me uncomfortable. So I've been trying to be brave in all of this. But it's still there, I guess. So I am just wondering what to do." I didn't say anything though.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" You looked over at me and then back at me before continuing. "I'm not sure. We've never really done this, and I probably should be more specific with this, but I want to know if I still turn you on?"</p> <p>The way you looked at me made me nervous. "Okay. Why not?" I said cautiously. "Do you like to have your hand down my pants?"</p> <p>"Umm, I guess a little."</p> <p>"I want to hear you say it," I said. "I know you say you love doing it, but I was a little worried about whether it was going to be really, um..."</p> <p>"Not really."</p> <p>"... fun?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah." I could feel the excitement building in the air.</p> <p>"So do you like to suck cock?" you asked.</p> <p>"I'm not that kind, it's just that it seems kinda out of place."</p> <p>"It's because it's you," you said. I had never met anyone like you before. Not because what you did was totally wrong and immoral or something, I was more sure of the power of being your jailer. I was more convinced that it was what you truly meant.</p> <p>"Can I please suck your cock?"</p> <p>"What's wrong with it?" you asked me. "Are you sure that you haven't given in to some sort of impulse? Do you want me to just have you suck it?"</p> <p>"You really want me to suck your cock?" I asked. How the hell did you know that?</p> <p>"Of course I want you to," you said. "I would do anything for you. I couldn't believe how much I'd wanted you to give me pleasure."</p> <p>"You mean, you'd like to suck it?" you asked.</p> <p>Before I could answer, you leaned down and took my hand, pulling me towards you as we both moved towards the bed. You straddled my legs, and slowly pushed down on them. I couldn't believe how bold we were getting. And as we kissed we slid easily off the bed, towards the floor, and you stood before me wearing nothing but a pair of tight red boxer shorts.</p> <p>"God, you don't even need to put them on," you said as you pulled them down revealing your shaved pubic area.</p> <p>I was not sure whether it was a sexual answer or not.</p> <p>"You can put them on any time," you said. I didn't say anything. I couldn't believe that you wanted me to do this. "I'm gonna fuck your brains out and I'm not gonna hold back," you said, and then your kiss became more serious. You reached down and pulled my boxers down, freeing my cock. It immediately sprung to attention.</p> <p>"God, your cock IS huge." you said, before wrapping your lips had barely made contact. "I can't have ever seen one as big," and it.
