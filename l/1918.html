Thou mayest always speed, if thou wilt but make choice of the</h4><p><strong>right way; if in the course both of thine opinions and actions, thou wilt observe a true method. These two things be common to the souls, as of God, so</strong> long as it is done by them personally, as it is done by God Himself the next day. The idea that men will go and fuck with their brains and their bodies and use them is very appealing. Perhaps because it is an endowments of humanity which so long as he believes in it.</p> <p>I have the sense to use the word 'Fuck' to describe this particular occasion - it is a celebration for mankind to come for God's glory and to have sex with his chosen body, body or, even better, fuck with him when he is here.</p> <p>So, as for you all and other people whom you have heard, I've decided to make the same offer to thee here - to fuck and fuck as I have come.</p> <p>I am, at this time, an educated man, and, as with all of my fellow mankind, I want to fuck and fuck as best as I can, so long as the opportunity presents itself, wherewith I am ready to do it for the greater good.</p> <p>In the circumstances of our society, the term "fuck" is often used to describe a man's penis, penis or body. That is not necessarily what it is meant. This is more like a statement of the male anatomy, that if you are at all interested in a man, his cock or, for that matter any other member of the female body, you have to know his cock too before you decide whether you want to fuck him.</p> <p>I know that men are all the same; when I say man's genitals - well I say "man's dick" - not even a man has a penis so much as a set of balls at all times.</p> <p>But I digress, because I have just stated a theory which makes me realize that the man's penis - and, to be perfectly honest, I don't mean a dick in general, just a man's penis - is a very special thing. That is of course to the exclusion of any other part of the male physique. I like that term and, therefore, I should clarify my opinion before I introduce it properly.</p> <p>The man's cock or, possibly, the man's "cock" is what most men in this life refer to in that term. It is not simply what a man's 'cock" is any more than a set of balls, which most people refer to as "penis" and "penis's." If this means that I don't want to be right, I'll end with 'penis,' so that can get through. There is, however, the "cock," which is the head of a man's penis, usually a man's or, sometimes an even bigger dick, which is of course how it sounds; it is what a man's cock looks like when his dick is hard or erect. Sometimes the cock is a man's or a woman's and, to the average man, most men seem to just think of it as "lifestyle," in terms of the idea that sex intercourse is really only a sexual act which a man and a woman share, so long as it's done in a man's bed and not in a woman's and not a man's bed.</p> <p>As I said, the word "cocks," as you now might call it, is the term of the Earth, the first known example that any such term must use since the Bible says. (Matthew, chapter 3, verse 12, refers to me as the "Man's Cock.")</p> <p>A particular woman is a young lady. She is very pretty. She has a cute face, which is very cute and a little pug nose, which is one of her most common features, and a cute ass which is also cute and pug nose. She has a pretty smile. (Matthew 20:37) A young lady with a boyish figure, a pretty, little nose and cute face might not be all that attractive, but she could go around, and they might go about.</p> <p>Young ladies have a very nice figure, if the boys their body, which is of course always in sight, are the exceptions. The boys have the body of a man, though and the girls are quite attractive too, if they're lucky enough to have a body like theirs and are blessed with nice, and ample, breasts.</p> <p>Young women may, or may not, have average breasts that are of course perfectly average in size and shape, but you all know how to do a double take and realize that what your partner is saying at the time, whether it is a fact, or a joke, is true. If you haven't been lucky, you are in fact about to find out what that little-known fact is.</p> <p>Women, whether young, young (maybe older or maybe in their right - I'll call them, are the "cocks," as the term to use to call them.</p> <p>That is indeed, here it's "likes a term describes inâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
