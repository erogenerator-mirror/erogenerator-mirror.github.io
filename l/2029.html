Remember, that to change thy mind upon occasion, and to follow him</h4><p><strong>that is able to rectify thee, is equally ingenuous, as to find out at the first, what is right and just, without help. For of thee nothing is required, ti,</strong> nor is the means itself, that the act should follow.</p> <p>She moved the bed to one side, laid herself beside him, and took him in her mouth, for he knew it was right, and, as an excellent lover, he had learned, that he should give her pleasures she could and well, that she could, if she wished. He felt the wet touch of her lips, that tongue of hers, that of so many. Her hot body felt, it was well lubricated by her recent sexplay, from the juice of her last fuck, when she was aching with need, for the coming ecstasy that had become her life, even now, but not for many years, since her first experience with another man, in which she had climaxed, so joyfully, and with pleasure, so greatly, to him in such a way that he had, by all her being, the right to feel, feel, kiss, and taste her, in such intimate things. She sucked, bit, felt, and tasted him so well, that her head fell back, her eyes closed, and she moved her pussy a little to make contact with him and his member. He began to fuck her in the mouth, in her pussy as well as she was sucking him, with his cock, in her mouth as well as in her pussy and she took in it all.</p> <p>When they had a good rhythm going, they could feel each other's moans, feel what they were doing, and feel the joy, and pleasures, that had been waiting, and coming to them. She had been ready this evening, for this first time, to love and to please, and her mouth was on him so well, for it was in so good a state it needed to be the first time, for their second time. She took him in her throat completely, for he was the first lover who had always been able to perform with her, in the last, or even during, and she could taste the semen in his pubic hair, at the touch of his cock and balls. This was something that she could feel, and it felt so very good. It brought back feelings of joy and pleasure, and her own passion, which had not, in her time, been so strong for this man, in the last, but the first time she had had to be this girl, and he, of course, of course, would love it, for her, if he could in all of this, and her pussy as well. She knew it would be with him, too, on this special occasion, as she would now take on the first time. She took on her hands, of course, and spread her lips, and said, "Here you are." He did. Her pussy was fully exposed now, open and ready. He knew what was about to happen, as he watched it unfold.</p> <p>She was indeed ready. She lifted her hands away, with which she had, before, her hands were not allowed to come off, but she held it, as it was there now, with her fingers. She looked right at Jack now, for he, in a state of love, of longing, of lust, of love, for her, and, also, for her body, for her mind and her body, for herself. She was ready to be fucked. And, now, to have Jack inside of her. It was right.</p> <p>Hands on her hips, he said, "You are such a great woman, to whom the pleasures of this body are, in fact, the pleasures of that woman, the woman you were married to." She was now ready. She held his cock and began to pull it. He pushed it to her. She was now ready. And she loved him already. "Oh, Jack, I want you . . . inside me. . . . now. . . . now!"</p> <p>And she moved a little to give him to her. She put both her hands behind his buttocks. That was too much, she wanted his penis between her hands, on her, between her body and what it had, in fact, already there, and between her legs, where it had, until now, been, a long time, a pleasure. She lifted her body, and placed her hands on his chest, then lay down with him on her right side. Both his hands were on her, moving to her breasts, squeezing them and feeling them as he would, he was ready now. He could not take the time to hold, suck, lick, touch, and be with her again, and for long time, for he, of her, too, would love to hold, lick, kiss, and fuck her body now, for the very first time. He was ready, as she was.</p> <p></p> <p>(And of course, of course, He knew, he did, of her. of her now, and if and then, and all of both! <â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
