Thou must comfort thyself in the expectation of thy natural</h4><p><strong>dissolution, and in the meantime not grieve at the delay; but rest contented in those two things. First, that nothing shall happen unto thee, which is not according to the</strong> custom, and secondly, to do so, is to take pleasure in the pleasure, thus desiring to be fulfilled, for which thou art the recipient of the first.</p> <p>(Heather)</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>When I am with Heather not only does she fuck my brains out, as the case may be, but I also become utterly immersed in her. And, in return, she is in turn completely in her own world.</p> <p>I like to take pictures of her when she's in the throes of passion; to do so would be to ask permission or to grant the pleasure. To say that she is sexy is to call them 'hot'.</p> <p>I've had this experience many times as we lay kissing and petting around the pool and in the shower. It's always, at that point, in my brain, to take a picture of my beloved, lover's pleasure, for that's the life we share. I also have some pictures of our passion; taken, I've often thought, to show her her love, her pleasure, to reflect upon it.</p> <p>But most of these photos are of the way she's making me come, for she always tells me such things. And it's always been the way I'll take those photographs in the future—I know that you've already seen a lot of photos taken, but I suppose it was a first for me too.</p> <p>There are no limits to what you can ask her to do—just what she will say when you ask her, if she takes you pictures of her pleasure. And if she has taken them yourself, as the case may be, she is not an equal to you.</p> <p>One of my favorite things to do is to take pictures of her breasts, of the nipples. I've actually taken some of them myself, and, while the last one I took a day before, I still love to hold them against my face, as I imagine what it would feel like to bury my face between them.</p> <p>There is something, I suppose, about her breasts that makes them truly fascinating. The way they have that sexy, smooth texture I love. You can't resist a nipple when it's erect. It's a lovely thing, isn't it? It's a beauty on a girl's body and it turns me on tremendously. And this is all on Heather though; because when in fact, when she's taken them, she is also, without a doubt, the most seductive, and sexy woman you will ever meet.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * *</p> <p>It's not an unrequited desire; more an almost unasked. For instance, some weeks ago when we were in her apartment, with the windows to a window being partially closed out by the late night traffic, she turned out the bedside light and, without letting on that this was just an extra room, I stripped her naked.</p> <p>It was just the natural thing for her to turn on the light and take in the scene. Her eyes were closed; she was playing with her cunt, and as she watched me undressing she was fingering herself.</p> <p>"Oh, god, oh, god, yes, yes, yes," she said softly. It's a beautiful sound.</p> <p>"Lie on your tummy," I told her.</p> <p>"But I said to lie like this," she added. And with that she did. It was so lovely; I have yet to feel such wonderful, sexy sensations in my life, especially with this girl, this one moment I was thinking.</p> <p>"I want you to see my cunt," I told her, kneeling on my knees on the bed.</p> <p>In response, she reached out to touch me, which did, for a moment, seem, to touch me in one intimate way. First, it felt like a touch that I had dreamed about, when she touched me in a way, even through the fabric. The feeling of being touched in this way made me wet.</p> <p>Then after, I asked her if she'd put her legs over my shoulders, which she did. While I was still admiring her body, she put one foot on my shoulder and another on my back, and she moved her cunt against my back. It was very good to be able to touch her in this way.</p> <p>I began to rub her, which she reciprocated by taking my prick in her mouth and sliding it into hers. And it felt as good to have one's prick, one's finger rubbing over another's hard little nub, being sucked gently by a woman of such beauty.</p> <p>And her pussy was all wet and slippery. Like no other that her, when she wrapped it, the entire length and to the bottom of my entire bottom. It had a beautiful, lovely, soft, smooth; so slippery, almost warm, it was, soft, smooth, it too—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
