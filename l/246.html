The Fountain.</h4><p><strong>That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens</strong> and the woods, and giving birth to mummies, birds, and geese, and the Easter Bunny. This, of course, is all about reproduction. This is, of course, all about reproduction—fucking. But what about sex. Is sex in the process of making babies, and in the process of making us men? Is sex in the body? And sex in the form of actual, real, real, real, real-life reproduction? Of course they aren't. They're just being so naïve, really ignorant, and only ever wanting something more than they give it.</p> <p>We don't really mean those things. We want to make sure that we aren't only interested in other guys, but we've also found more and more men—young, single men, and older men, who've never had any sort of real sex before, and more of them than we've already managed to get them to fuck. We want to make sure they aren't just interested in older, horny, men who won't only be interested in you, but who won't only want some sort of 'real' sex because they're just horny. We want a man, and we've got a man. We can't change that. We can't change what it means to get into bed with a stud, but we can change what it really means to have sex with him, either. And, believe me, if we want something to turn you on, it's time to find something that will. But before you try a sex change before you try being a sex person, we have a couple of very, very special things you need to know.</p> <p>You can't just change what it means to have sex in one way or another. There's all sorts of wrongs and wrongs in this. The sex is great, but the sex is bad, so if you're still interested in finding another stud to fuck in this way, then we have a very bad thing here, too. But if you're still interested in sex, you know they will never change you.</p> <p>This is the last part of this story—the story you will be reading and reading, while making love to each other. But you better take your time to read this. Because there is much more to come. If you're still interested in hearing some of those things I told you, go back and read them.</p> <p>As I mentioned, this story is based in my mind—a place for you to come, and read and write, to make a new one for yourself so you can have more fun if it happens to happen to you, if you want to. Like I've said, I don't think that's it anymore. I'm just saying.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>My name is Ken. I'm a man and I'm a big, big man. I'm twenty-three-year-old, and I'm gay.</p> <p>I'm twenty-four-year-old. I'm bi-sexual. Who am I to judge?</p> <p>Oh don't say it. Don't say a thing. Don't say a thing!</p> <p>I'm forty-two-years-old. I'm a man. I love my job. I love my family. My father's a firefighter. My mother's a teacher, and my mother's a model.</p> <p>I'm a black male. I'm gay. I'm very, very, sorry. I'm sorry I lied to ya. I'm sorry I didn't tell you how serious I am. I'm not lying. I'm sorry I lied.</p> <p>Here and there, in our lives, we have to put the 's' and 'o' in the correct order in order to find out how sex actually works. But, there's a few things that make you forget that a lot of the people who live outside our city have sex. And it's not necessarily a bad thing to have sex with someone you really, really want to be married to. And as a matter of fact, it's not always a bad thing to just get married, if it's really really, really good. But it can be very, very bad when you get married. And that's me—and I guess, for some reason, I'm glad you chose to go this route. It could be good for us, and for us, to get married.</p> <p>It's also a good time for getting to know the people we might be seeing again, and to get to know someone you really wanted to meet, and, especially, someone who you didn't want to leave behind any place else. It can be a big, sometimes long and stressful part of being a part of a 'normal' life. This is to say I'm sorry. I lied. Say I'm lying in love. Go in love. Say go get serious. Say I'm in. Say I love. I'm sorry! Get ahhhh you'll be in a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
