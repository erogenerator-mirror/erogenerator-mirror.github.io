Nature hath its end as well in the end and final consummation of</h4><p><strong>anything that is, as in the begin-nine and continuation of it.</strong> I never fucked up in life, but I've screwed it up plenty in the past, so it feels good to say so. The first thing you need to know about fucking is that you don't fuck. It's hard, you don't fuck, but you do it.</p> <p>Your first lover was your best friend. His dick was amazing and they fell in love. I mean in that moment, I was there with them, sharing in it all. He was also a sex addict, and it was hard to do at first, but he loved it after a few months. So he fucked me once, and I was in lust after that.</p> <p>But my first sex was really slow. I wanted him to last for awhile. I kept waking up in his arms and feeling his body on mine all the time. Then he finally gave up and just slept with me.</p> <p>I was not sure why and I didn't want to make a big deal at the time. The idea was that he wanted to fuck me and just have sex. It wasn't really that, really, but I liked the idea of him fucking me and fucking me good after I had just been laid. I loved it because I could feel it in my pussy.</p> <p>The first time was really hard, because it was so slow. It just felt like a second person, not just you. He was still asleep, but all I wanted to do was turn around and kiss him until he went off.</p> <p>I couldn't even sleep because I missed making out with him. It was almost impossible that we were on the carpet, his dick inside me, so I could feel the whole thing, from bottom to top. Like on a stage or in a theatre, it felt amazing to feel his big dick pushing inside me. I felt like I had never imagined sex before, and he felt so amazing.</p> <p>Anyway, he finally rolled over, and then he was asleep again. I felt like I'd probably wake him back up from a light dream, but I wasn't sure. The first time he was asleep, you had to get real sleep. I just kept dreaming about him, hoping it would never stop. I just could not stop touching myself and dreaming of him.</p> <p>And then he woke up and his cock was inside my pussy. His dick was so big, so long, and so perfectly curved... I loved how it felt. Just as I began to feel myself starting to come, we began. We just kept kissing and groping passionately at first, and then we were even more excited and less tired. We fucked like crazy, even on the couch, and if we had any privacy, we just fucked every few minutes.</p> <p>When we finished, we fell into bed together and slept all night. At first I just lay there and held him. And eventually he started waking up and kissing me good morning. We were really like two lovers. So it was wonderful to just hold him and let him kiss me good morning.</p> <p>After he was ready, he just slid out from behind me and I started rubbing him. He just slid up on me and we fucked. I finally felt like I was on a mission because I was horny as fuck, and I wasn't sure I would feel as horny if he was fucking me. I wasn't sure then what I felt like now.</p> <p>I never stopped touching myself when we just started screwing. I finally felt like I needed to touch and feel a penis inside of me just once, and that really got me all worked up.</p> <p>And then he slipped inside and kissed me good morning. I couldn't hold back. I just had to have him. I had to feel his dick inside of me. He slid inside of me and started kissing me again. And then he started thrusting inside. He could hardly control himself. I can't explain what it was about seeing him in my mind so fully and completely. I was just so happy we were on the couch fucking, and I was feeling so proud of him. I could only imagine how many people we could have made love with, what it would be like to see his dick thrusting in my pussy to end all love and sex. He was so handsome and so wonderful.</p> <p>You never know what you're capable of, sweetheart.</p> <p>One of the most memorable nights was when we were at a club, right after he did something really amazing for me. I felt like if I could tell him all he wanted to do for me, there would be something. He just needed to know first, that's all. I loved knowing I couldn't wait to see where it would lead to.</p> <p>As we kept kissing and fucking, our lovemaking became more and even more passionate, we were like lovers, the firsts, we started, I loved first, I started wanting to fuck me all of all, I was I would love all his big, I'm one.
