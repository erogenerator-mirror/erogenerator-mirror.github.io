He had his eye on the two women, sitting on the sofa and watching a film, an actor/actress/heroine he had no desire to even think about but who were watching the film with him and he wanted to talk with her.</p> <p>An hour or so later, as the film ended and the credits began to roll, the women moved apart and moved toward each other and then they were both leaning on each other, kissing. The actor/actress was already on her back, her top half riding up. She had her legs wrapped around his waist, her back curved up. He was on top, his hips sliding in and out of hers, sliding faster. Every woman had at some point turned into an item of intercourse before and for some reason he could clearly image himself sliding into their wet pussy, her walls sucking on his cock while he made another attempt at sex.</p> <p>The woman got up first, but before she was halfway back onto the sofa, she knelt in front of him and began sucking. A guy always wanted to be sucked on while watching porn. It was a special kind of oral sex. The one that seemed to happen while a guy was getting fucked. Sometimes he got off in a blowjob while watching other guys and there was nothing more erotic than that moment and then his cock went to harden. It was a special moment.</p> <p>The movie had ended, so the woman got on her back and her lover came on her tits - or wherever he had been jacking off. It was a special moment. Her lover had no idea and no idea of her lover. The sex part of their first encounter had been the most exciting thing about it and he was surprised that at all. He was also surprised that, at that point, she had a thing for oral sex - a desire to make love, or anything else. It was obvious that the reason for the sex had been with her lover, so she didn't blame herself for feeling like it.</p> <p>They sat together for a long time, staring into each other's eyes. After a bit, the woman pushed up her lover's skirt. She didn't wear panties either. He was right - she wasn't wearing any. She was shaved. Her lover was shaved.</p> <p>"I take it that we are even," she said.</p> <p>"Sure," he replied.</p> <p>"Good?"</p> <p>"Definitely," he responded.</p> <p>She smiled at him. "Not much else to say, is there?"</p> <p>"We get to be a lot," he said with a smile. "It had been very tense, but I didn't want to be too overjoyed at the end of it. We were having the time of our lives as couples and it was all just for our own pleasure. So we just got to know each other, maybe even had sex."</p> <p>The woman lifted up her lover's skirt again until the bottom half of his cock was exposed.</p> <p>"I like that," she said.</p> <p>The movie ended. The woman had been doing a turn. A sex movie is better for both partners. The sex started then. The man on top, the sexy woman above, the man's cock slid into her and they were all making love then.</p> <p>The actress went back for a moment. He was not sure what to expect from what she was doing.</p> <p>"He's already hard," she said.</p> <p>He felt that familiar feeling. He could almost feel the tension. His cock was already hard.</p> <p>"He did?"</p> <p>He felt her hand on his cock. He didn't see she put it in her mouth. "It was just me. I didn't need much of that."</p> <p>"You're definitely making him."</p> <p>"Maybe because you're hot enough for both ends of it?"</p> <p>"Why, what?"</p> <p>"You know what I mean?"</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>"That sounds about right."</p> <p>They laughed quietly and then the movie ended.</p> <p>"The thing is, I don't want to talk about it right now," the man said.</p> <p>"Maybe we can just go to bed," she said, already off the sofa but on the floor beside her. She picked her lover up in her arms and they fell into bed. They were on their feet. He felt her lips on his as he came from behind. The night had been a lot of fun, with the right partner and a woman who took full control, but this was a whole different perspective. He felt his partner's tongue on his cock as she gently stroked him. They were like they were caressing. They were making love making love making love. The man and fucking. They were fucking them.</p> <p>The film had never stopped. The woman kissing.</p> <p>And finally—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
