Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a triumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself. Let us strike</strong> a deal.</p> <p>She leaned back, closed her eyes and spread her legs wide open on the bed, inviting me in. I was still naked but of an elegant elegance. I had already stepped into the room, taken my gown off and was now lying on the luxurious bed. I was now sporting my best erection as I climbed over her, and in front of her. She began to stroke my hard cock until with a quick, stuttering cough I stepped back. In her excitement and shame I didn't make any gesture to leave her alone. Instead, my hands slipped on her shoulders and slowly slid down her neck, leaving those lovely orbs in view, my hands cupping and squeezing her breasts. I began to move down her body, her eyes flicking up to my face as her fingers curled firmly around my shaft.</p> <p>But all she was aware of was the thrill of my hands on her breasts. And I wanted her so much. Her expression never changed, as she lifted her arms to allow me free access, and I dropped my head to take one of her nipples between my teeth. A soft groan of approval emanated from between those perfect thighs and she clutched at my cock while I was distracted and happy. When I switched to the other one, she arched her back, thrusting her breasts higher into the air and began to whimper a little. I continued my exploration, gently biting and sucking her nipple, which made her arch her back again. But not as much as she had earlier; rather her whole body was quivering with anticipation as I moved slowly downward, my hands gliding over her thighs and over her pubic hair, moving slowly down a little at a time as she became even more moist, the scent of her pussy filling me with desire. She was clearly aroused, the way she was breathing, the way she moved her head from side to side as I kissed my way down her thighs, until I could run my tongue over the soft, creamy flesh of her labia.</p> <p>Her body was exquisite. Her thighs trembled, her hands pressing against the flesh of my head to control my descent downward as I began to suck her labia through the opening of her cunt, her pussy opening, moist and pliable in my mouth. Her pussy tasted so clean and sweet; the scent of her sex was almost incensing and I could imagine my tongue inside her even as I licked and sucked the outer lips and her clit, sending shivers through her body, making her tremble and writhe in sensual waves over each of my lips and face. I slid my hands over her thighs, massaging her thighs as I moved them apart, moving my tongue from her exposed vagina to her anus, slipping it inside, swirling it around it as I slowly started to push my tongue deeper inside her. And, despite her shame, she arched in ecstasy, moaned, "Oh, yeah, lick it! Oh, fuck, lick my ass!" and started to tremble as I began to move my tongue in and out of her, pushing it deeper into her wet, tight anus, my tongue flicking over her clit as it slid back and forth over it. I began to move in and out, licking her in and out of her anus, feeling her quiver as my tongue stroked her clitoris, feeling it begin to throb as I continued to work it all the way into her body; pushing it up and down to her belly as her movements and gasps filled my ears; feeling as my mouth slid slowly up and down inside of her.</p> <p>After a minute she pulled me up to her and gave me to kiss, her hands stroking down my back and back, backside, my legs. I slid my hands under her bottom, feeling her bottom in my hands, the smooth cheeks parted, and the silky pussy flesh sliding over her clitoris, pressing into my palms. She put her arms around my neck and I knew then just how good she was at kissing, but it wasn't anything that she would ever do to me right this moment, but just an artful, sensual affair on my tongue and lips as she sucked mine into her mouth. It was incredible and erotic, the passion of feeling one's mouth on the other's mouth, the smell, the texture, the sight, and the taste as they played a harmonious symphony into the universe. And she was as well, her hips sliding back and forth as my mouth kept moving. My cock was throbbing and hard, begging for release by the minute, and I thought of her bottom and her lips and I could feel it throbbing and quivering all through my own body as sheath at this moment began to quiver from all over. my tongue. I felt as she took me. So felt her vagina, my face with her mouth, as she moved her vagina, my own mouth, our eyes on mine, as mine, and she moved her eyesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
