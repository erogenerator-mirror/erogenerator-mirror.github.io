So</strong> that I could give a real demonstration of my pleasure, or, in the case of our society's own discus discus discus' which I might also be able to perform, I'll call my first and second names in a word: "Anatholna, Anastolia" or "Phallic Kilo"; and I had, just minutes before, with the pleasure to be mine of which a clitoris had an even more special name: "Anatholna-luteal Sex!"</p> <p>And, though we would not get to that now -- and perhaps we would not get to that sooner or later -- if I first began sucking his cock, I just have to tell you my first name, Anatholna-luteal Sex, is a name for me as a kind of female genitalia, and for you as the male genitalia of which I was born. To use a more crudely-pronounced name than a sort of male genitalia, I thought: what a lovely name.</p> <p>"You want to know who I suck on?</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"You just start sucking," and I had just made up his favorite part for me, when with one good suck, he would say, "Oh, yes, Anatholna. Ahhhhh, Ahhhhhhhh." And I'd just say, "Oh, that's good," and suck him more energetically than I thought I could.</p> <p>I'd just keep sucking him that way, and he was sucking me back that way, at the same time, with such gusto that I'm sure I wouldn't even know any better. And when his first orgasm had come, and his first orgasm and an orgasm too, and that was the best moment (and therefore the happiest moment and the most memorable), or any other memory, whether that was my second orgasm or mine, or both, or both, I'd hold him close to me so that he'd feel comfortable to breathe, and I'd just look at his face and whisper: "It just isn't right to be sucking someone's penis when only the clitoris is called. Isn't it to be sucked on the first date or last or last-night, when only the clitoris is called?" And so I'd try to explain that it was just a little oral pleasure, but in an unemotional way.</p> <p>At the moment, though, I had to tell him that it was not only in the sex-life, or the sex itself that I was not only sucking on his penis but the clitoris, too. We were both, at that moment, in our own little erotic way, having sexual intercourse when the clitoris could be called and I had the most splendid clitoral orgasm with the utmost sensitivity, which I know can happen only in the throes of passion, because, as I said to him, he has always taken to calling me by female name, when the clitoris is called. So the clitoris is a sexual appendage, and the clitoral act is a sexual pleasure to the man and woman by which he loves and adores them in turn: a most wonderful pleasure, a most wonderful pleasure. And so it wasn't a sexual act, either, but a sexual act only when the clitoris is called.</p> <p>So the sex was sexual, too ... and also sexual in the most fundamental sense, of course. Because of the many things that man and woman can do. Because a man likes that which is called giving pleasure; a man likes that which is called receiving. Therefore, from a man in the sex act to a woman in the sexual act, then we can certainly be, in the word of a man, a man who loves and trusts a woman. So it certainly isn't sexual in the truest sense, but, although I have already said that it is in the most natural sense and the most natural way of doing it, I really, really meant that we should try our best to make our sex act as good as possible. Of course, this is true also from a woman who loves herself only, as she loves and trusts a man, as she loves and trusts a man who loves and trusts a woman. Thus why I'm saying, in no uncertain terms, that we should try our best to make our sex act as good as possible and to make it memorable, with the greatest of all pleasures, which is to be given by mutual loving and of love, by giving the most pleasure from our actions.</p> <p>In this way, as with a man by a woman, the sex act itself, with the great pleasures itself, of course, is the most joyous and delightfully enjoyable experience of all our lives, and in many ways, by means of sexual and of sexual pleasure. It can be expressed by two, of mutual loving our love or of body or soul. Thus we have also by expressing two. Or we have all three.
