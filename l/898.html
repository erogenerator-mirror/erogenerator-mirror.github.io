It was time. Life had happened.</p> <p>He felt a brief shock of excitement that had the previous week's events to end his life being one of the defining moments of his life. That night he was standing at the bedside, watching his sister as she laid on her back, her legs spread, as he mounted her body with a smile that was more a satisfied look than anything else.</p> <p>Her tits were bouncing, her hands were flying over her face as her chest shuddered above her face - she was so close! Her cunt was on the other side of the bed as she raised her legs up and apart in a welcoming gesture that he knew would be soon enough to make him cum.</p> <p>She made the bed creak and roll as he moved towards her - this was so fucking beautiful! Her body was trembling as she wrapped one arm around him. Then she did something amazing - she pulled her nipple out from her breast, sucked in his cock, and then came up his body and kissed him. She tasted, so much, just like he remembered. Then she pushed him down onto the bed and climbed on top. He felt a little embarrassed as she rolled her hips back and forward a little, then pulled herself close to his body and kissed him until she felt him harden and press against her. He was excited. He couldn't wait to get hard again! He pulled himself towards her and she spread her legs open again, then reached down and guided his cock into her body a little.</p> <p>They just lay there for a little while - like that. Just enjoying each other's bodies. The sensation of her naked body, the feel of her smooth skin under his hands, the feel of her nipples in his palms, the way she felt so sexy when her hands ran up and down his back and her breathing deepened.</p> <p>He could feel the excitement in her body building; just before he was going to go he pulled back and rolled his hips up, feeling his cock enter her wet cunt. She moaned in pleasure when he entered her. He pulled out slowly to the point where the tip just seemed to stop inside her pussy lips, then he plunged it forwards again, into her pussy and stopped halfway there, savouring the way she felt on the edge of explosion - she was so wet!</p> <p>And still he was right up against her, his cock almost touching her cervix - feeling like he was making love with her body, his dick just pressing into her - her pussy lips wrapped around the tip of his cock and pushing into her at the same time as he began to stroke upwards in a long, slow and steady, long stroke.</p> <p>He stopped for a second with his cock fully inside his sister's body and just began to tease her nipples with his right hand. Then he began to move with him, slow and easy, feeling his cock slide against her. His cock felt so damned good inside her. Her body was so sexy. For the first time when he had fucked her, he felt as though he was a guy. So in tune with her body. So in tune with the way she felt with his dick inside her pussy, the way they writhed together against each other, they felt as one.</p> <p>Her hips were undulating with every move she made and every time she did it felt as though she were moving against his dick instead of the bed itself as it slowly slid past her body. This was so different from his own body and his sister. She moved her hips almost hypnotically on his cock: her movements seemed so sexy. So sexy. Her eyes were closed and her mouth had taken his right earlobe on the next downward motion.</p> <p>He continued to tease her nipples as he continued to feel her body as clearly as though it was in a movie. He slowly slid his cock out of his sister's body, all the way to the head, then back in, then back out, then in. He didn't really know how many times he could have been inside her - all that time that he had felt like this, all that time he had felt what was happening - all that time he had been on the edge of cumming in anticipation of fucking this girl, his sister.</p> <p>He began to slide his cock in and out between her legs, a movement that made her even more sexy. He felt his dick slipping up and down her body as he moved in and out. Her nipples were so hard, so erect. They felt like they were against his bare skin instead of hard plastic. Or maybe she wanted him in her pussy?</p> <p>His own sister was loving this!</p> <p></p> <p>And he stopped again - and began to stroke her from her breasts again and again and again and again and again and again, over and again... and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. She felt like the ecstasy and again and again and again.
