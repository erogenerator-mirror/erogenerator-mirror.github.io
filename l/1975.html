That which most men would think themselves most happy for, and</h4><p><strong>would prefer before all things, if the Gods would grant it unto them after their deaths, thou mayst whilst thou livest grant unto thyself; to live again. See the things</strong>, the things of all things, the things of that which thou art most wise of all men. And you may wish to ask them to grant the wish so called, if it be of such; you may wish it with all that thou mind, the most wise of them.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p></p> <p>I could tell that I had been looking at her ass throughout the afternoon but it had disappeared into the shadows as she walked over to me. I saw a small white pendant on top of the pendant, on which was inscribed what I thought of as a symbol, "Doll". It appeared as a symbol for a woman's body; her body. She was wearing a thin, white robe, which she was holding in her hand.</p> <p>She reached for me, placed both hands around my neck and pulled me down to kiss me, the kiss was as passionate or as passionate as we were kissing. The kiss took us all by surprise, as we had never kissed like that before. But the kiss had changed; she had become more passionate.</p> <p>I couldn't keep my hands out of her robes; I squeezed them tightly to keep them from falling open. As it was, they fell down her thighs as if she was naked underneath. "Doll" took off my robe, and placed it over me, like a blanket. I felt the warmth of her mouth as she began to lick and suck on my nipples, the soft soft of the hair on the back of my head. I placed my hands on her cheeks and drew her mouth onto mine. I could feel her teeth grazing against my nipples like a predator upon its prey; her moist, wet mouth on mine turned me on to the point of near orgasm.</p> <p>We broke our kiss; she looked at the pendant on me. It read, "The Divine." Then her face took on the expression one would expect in a woman of her status and character. She placed her mouth atop mine, our tongues intertwined, and I moved my arms around her; she had to be in her 20's, and I couldn't remember her in this way, but it was a pleasant experience.</p> <p>I pushed my mouth into hers again. I could feel her tongue begin to probe my mouth. Soon her hand had joined in the act. She placed her hand on my chest and began to stroke it very lightly and she knew that I liked it. As she stroked me, I felt her hand on my own member, it slowly moved over the entire length of it. I closed my eyes as she stroked me, and she took the sign of my orgasm from my lips. She rubbed her hand over it like a cat rubbing herself.</p> <p>My mouth came off of hers and we kissed long and hard. It was like we were just a couple of people who knew each other and had shared a common sexual experience. I could feel the heat rising between us. This may be the end of a long, exciting dayâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
