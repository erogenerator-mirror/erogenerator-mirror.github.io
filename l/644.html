Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers</strong> would be forced into the hands of a small party the following year.</p> <p>The party was planned for that night and was held in the mountains of the eastern reaches of Norway. It was supposed to be the ultimate battle of the Norwegian Army. It was a night out on a ski slope somewhere. A group of twenty fighters were gathering at the opening, in a quiet building off a slope that ran a block down to the other side. The room was a mix of cold beer and alcohol, mostly from the party in question.</p> <p>The men from the party were all over eighteen. It was a very liberal atmosphere and the majority of the men wore tuxedos. A small fire was lit at the base of the stairs with a large mirror sitting on the floor. A man on a couch in a grey tuxedo entered the party from the back to the door, wearing an expensive tuxedo. As soon as the door shut behind him, he took off his tuxedo jacket and began unbuttoning his own shirt, moving towards the party. He was followed by another man in tuxedo, who also wore tuxedo. The man stopped at the rail separating the dance floor from the rest of the party as his tuxedo began to shed.</p> <p>He was followed by two other men from another group, wearing the same tuxedo. By the end of the song, the two older men were both naked. A pair of blonde twins were wearing clothes, except that they wore sandals to cover their feet when their heads moved side to side.</p> <p>At the second dance, the girl who had been dancing with him had disappeared and her partner was lying on the floor, with the other man underneath him. By the third dance, the two men on the floor were naked. At the end of the third song, the first man was underneath the second guy.</p> <p>The second man had his arms around the blonde twins' slim, pale, and dark faces. The blonde twins had their arms around the blond man's neck, their small breasts pressing against his broad chest. The blond man's hands were on the top of the girls faces, squeezing and caressing them. The blonde man's lips were close to the blond twins' mouth and he began kissing them there. The blonde man was pressing himself against the blonde twin and moving his hands down towards the blonde girl's hips. The blonde man began to kiss the blond's neck and moved his hands down further, his fingers pushing through the blond's blonde hair on either side of his head as he slowly kissed his way to the back of the blonde girl's neck. The blonde man lifted his head, letting his hair wave back and forth through his fingers as he kissed the blonde girl's neck.</p> <p>When the second man began to lower his mouth down the blond girl's shoulder and onto her shoulder, he moved his mouth over to the blonde girl's neck and began moving his lips back over it. The blonde man knelt beside the blond girl and began to kiss her mouth. Meanwhile, the blond man was still kissing and eating the blond girl's neck and shoulders. The blonde man slowly pulled her hair slightly from the back of her neck and began to chew on her neck. As a result, his head appeared above her upper chest and began to move from the left side of her face and to the right side of her neck. Both men continued to kiss and lick and chew the hairless blonde girl while they stared at each other. All of a sudden, the blonde man pulled back from the blonde's neck, turned around and moved across the floor. He knelt on the floor and raised her right leg over his shoulder. He lifted the leg and placed it on his shoulder, then lowered her leg until his head was level with her sex, his mouth covering her sex.</p> <p>The blonde man took one of her legs and turned her so her feet were still on the floor. Then he slowly moved his mouth upwards from the other leg, leaving just a glistening hair surrounding her womanhood. Then he brought his mouth back down until her sex was inches from his face. Her legs closed tight, preventing his mouth from touching her, but, at the same time, she relaxed. Once he had brought her to a level where she was ready to touch herself, he quickly began with her mouth, then her hand.</p> <p>The blonde man was now between her legs. After she had reached her first orgasm when the blonde guy suddenly leaned forward and began licking her pussy. For a brief moment, the blonde man only tasted skin and a pussy, but, while she had orgasm before, it was still a beautiful new experience for her. He had licked the blonde's pussy like this before but never before. He continued to make love the blonde's face with his lips and his tongue. Meanwhile, the blonde's hands were holding the blond man's upper body to her pussy and slowly as his backside.</p> <p></p> <p>After that first time had passed—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
