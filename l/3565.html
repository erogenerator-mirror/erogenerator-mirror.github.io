Bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in the Ring, blinking at his</strong> surroundings.</p> <p>"Don't you remember any of that?" he asked, holding the Paralysed culprit and staring at his own collar.</p> <p>"Uh-huh," Bitzer nodded and placed the offender gently on its table as the Paralysed culprit looked his reflection in the mirror of the Paralysed culprit's collar.</p> <p>"I've been gone for four hours." The Paralysed culprit's answer. "Now get your head out of your skull and go up stairs so you can catch a flight."</p> <p>Bitzer sat back down. He turned to face the Head Boy's reflection.</p> <p>He felt strange as he walked slowly from the classroom to the Head Boy's classroom. The Head Boy was still dressed. The Head Boy's eyes flashed and his mouth dropped in open mouthed confusion.</p> <p>"I don't trust you Head Boy," Bitzer said quietly, as he strode up to the Head Boy, "and I have no reason to trust you."</p> <p>The Head Boy stared at Bitzer. His mind flashed back to the time when Bitzer had fucked him on his desk. He was the one that had taken the initiative and was fucking Bitzer's arsehole. He had fucked Bitzer all over the office. He had watched him with his mobile out, calling Bitzer's bluff in trying to find another willing sex partner to replace Bitzer's cock. As much as Bitzer was an arsehole licker, he was a perfect, perfect, hot, sexy, sexy, arselicking arsehole.</p> <p>Bitzer was in fact the head of the office when the Head Boy was at his desk, staring down at him and making sure the Head Boy didn't have a single word of explanation or complaint that could even explain what had happened between Bitzer and the head of the office.</p> <p>The Head Boy could only think that he had a solution. This time he would be on the bridge and he would make sure that Bitzer wasn't in the next class who was paying the bus trip. The Head Boy would be on the bus leaving the office.</p> <p>The Head Boy watched with growing dread as he slowly pulled on his leather bootlace and climbed up the stairs of the Head Boy's classroom to collect his ticket and bag.</p> <p>To make matters worse he received a message on Bitzer's mobile phone that said: Bitzer,</p> <p>Your trip is now at eight o'clock. If you don't pick a time to meet me I have just one request from you.</p> <p>Bitzer,</p> <p>Please pick me up at eight after school.</p> <p>See you at school please,</p> <p>Bitzer.</p> <p>Brely.</p> <p>Bitzer sat up in his chair and put down the helmet.</p> <p>The bellboy opened the door and looked up at Bitzer. Bitzer turned to get up on his elbow.</p> <p>"Don't worry Head Boy, you will meet me at school." Bitzer said quietly as he raised his eyebrows in expectation of meeting for the first time since last Friday. "Don't be late, be up well before seven.</p> <p>Bitzer smiled and walked back down to his desk.</p> <p>"Are you getting changed?" Bitzer said to him. He had a little trouble in his head.</p> <p>"Yep, er. I just finished getting dressed and I should go downstairs to change. I'll see you at school."</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Bjamin Smith awoke from his sleep on Monday. It had been one hell of a dream and in his confused state he had no reason to lie.</p> <p>It had been his first day of school and he had had to stand on the steps to get the school bus to the railway station. As he walked over to the train he was looking around the bus in terror. There was no way this train had been there. It was a very big and large commuter train. The train had to be the end of the country, just up and down country. The only thing good about it was people always came up to the station to pick up their tickets.</p> <p>"Hello? Oh, hi, do you know where everything is?"</p> <p>Bjamin Smith saw a very tall and slender young woman from next-door who looked familiar but couldn't place her or why her head was out of the window and had been closed at that moment of her life.</p> <p>"No," he said nervously.</p> <p>"It's okay, I'll get your stuff." The girl smiled warmly and led him to the bus.</p> <p>When they arrived at the ticket booth the woman reached over and squeezed Bitzer's shoulder. Buttons. Bitzer looked around the seats. She placed a piece of paper and a big piece of paper. The paper. Bitzer was only thing you had written on the paper.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>He smiled and had to to</p> <p>the world andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
