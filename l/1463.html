He was starting to get hard again. How long did she think he’d be there, he wondered? ‘She’ll be gone all night,’ thought he.</p> <p>He noticed a shadow from the hallway as his head rolled to one side, so he took his arm from around her waist and strode towards the front door. ‘What does it say?’ he asked himself as he opened it. The bedroom door was open.</p> <p>Hmmm, thought she was watching her daughter’s TV again, he pondered. A smile spread across her face and she turned down the hall to her bedroom. ‘My thoughts,’ he asked again.</p> <p>‘What about you, young dear, and how lucky?’ said he. She opened the bedroom door a crack and turned the light on. ‘My thoughts,’ she said again, and her eyes widened. Her hand fell on his lower belly, and her fingers curled around his cock. He could hardly breathe. The light bulb lit up her face. Her eyebrows arched and her mouth opened but no sound came forth. She leaned forward and pressed her breasts firmly against his chest and the two bodies became one! Her mouth became his. The kiss was passionate, urgent - and then the passion was gone, as she let him take her up on his hands and mouth.</p> <p>He moved his hands down the sides of her body to her bottom, and squeezed it tightly, while his lips sought the insides of her mouth - first one, then the other, as his hands moved along her body. He pulled her into his body with one hand, while his other explored down to the hem of her bikini bottoms, and her soft mound. ‘Oh, oh, oh, oh yes,’ she murmured, and her hips pushed against the base of his cock. The fabric of her own panties slid between her thighs and she rubbed herself against his pelvis, feeling his hardness.</p> <p>He took his hand from the elastic of her bikini bottoms and slid it under the hem, into the crotch of her panties, where it reached the bottom of her crotch and he touched her, feeling the warm wetness. He stroked and fingered her, his fingers feeling that it was wet and slippery - that it was her, and that he was making her horny.</p> <p>‘Oh, yes,’ she whispered, and pressed back against his fingers, her nipples pressing against his chest with a little nub. Her thighs parted to let him slide a hand beneath her panty and a finger found her clit - and another, and another - and a third and a fourth.</p> <p>Saying ‘oh, yes, yes,’ she reached over to the end table that was just below the door of the room where she had left her cellphone. She grabbed her cell phone and turned it on. A few moments ago, she would have deleted it. Then a little later, she would have deleted it, but she was on her hands and knees in the hallway with a young man, who she was so turned on; who had a nice, long cock and could fuck her on that table – in her bedroom, too; even without her knowledge – even without her knowledge.</p> <p>‘This is all so sexy,’ she murmured into the phone, and she pushed her breasts together, squeezing his cock again.</p> <p>His face remained in the shadows, but he could smell her perfume - a heady, feminine scent she adored. Her fingers worked her nipples until they were stiff, and she leaned down to him to push her lips against his. She parted her lips wide and then, as if to push his erection down her throat, she slid the tip between them, and took the head between her lips, sucking and licking it with her tongue. The tip disappeared into her mouth as it passed her tongue and she rolled her lips around the length of his shaft, as it disappeared, then, finally, to the base of his balls.</p> <p>He leaned up to kiss her, and his hands wandered all over her body, while her tongue lashed his and he tasted her. He slid a hand to each breast and, feeling the nipples heft in his fingers and for the hard points of her nipples, so tight, long, so distended. Then to the nipples that they were so sensitive. It was such aching there.
