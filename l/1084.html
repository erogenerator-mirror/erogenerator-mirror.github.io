Appetite grows with loving. To know that her name was Ursule was</strong> written there was always hope. The question was, 'Are these two things meant to be joined, that it was meant to be love or that it was meant to be in bed'.</p> <p>*</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>Marius sat with the door open, wondering what the most beautiful woman in the world would look like naked. Or how it would be to enter into the room. He didn't doubt the possibility of having her naked and in bed with him, but if her pussy were as beautiful as the breasts of a beautiful woman, or if they were as big as his mother's or his sister's, then he would have to worry about how to get them inside of him. His sister was not the most beautiful woman, but the fact he was single was still an unspoken fact between him and sister. Still, even as he gazed at her beauty, he knew there was a possibility that she was as hot as his sister was.</p> <p>Or that she was just as gorgeous or better than his sister was. But, if they were in love, they'd already been through the stages of intimacy. Even as his sister asked him how he felt about being on the floor with a beautiful woman naked, he wondered if she would be able to understand, how he would feel about him having sex with his sister, if, just as he was wondering her, if there was a possibility that her beauty was as great as her beauty; then he had to let that wonder go.</p> <p>As to what it would feel like to have sex with both of them, he didn't know, but perhaps he had some ideas, that he would like to, that he would ask her to join them if he didn't want one of them to think he was a slut. Maybe he just wanted to be sure that this would be a first time thing, that he was only going to regret having his sex with one of his sisters, that he wasn't going to do it again.</p> <p>He decided, now that he knew that her nakedness was meant to be his, that he would do everything he had ever learned to be better than his mother or sister, if she were as beautiful as his sister was. Perhaps he would want to keep having sex with her. He had thought so, before, if her sexiness was as beautiful as his sister's, he wouldn't want to share her body with someone else. He would want to feel his sister's body. The fact he didn't even know what he wanted in a woman but just the fact he had a beautiful sister naked would help him get over this feeling himself.</p> <p>As to what happened then, how could he say no?</p> <p>His thoughts turned to kissing his sister, as his sister had done with him. He realized with a smile that he loved kissing his sister, as much as he loved his mother. And he would definitely still love to have sex with both of them. What did all this mean to him? What caused him to want to do this? But, that was part of the question.</p> <p>He felt his sister's hand on his leg, and she rubbed it and rubbed him more. The feel of her hands, her touch, seemed to be more erotic than his mother's. He had wanted her to ask him what it was that he wanted, and asked in return, was this what was between him and his sister. He had wanted his sister to have sex with him, and asked, but she never came back the same way. Even if she had asked him in turn if he wanted to suck on her nipples and be kissed by her and make passionate love with her, he would have said "not right now", yet now he knew he wanted more.</p> <p>His sister's hand moved up to his penis. She stroked him softly, slowly, to make sure everything was okay and that she was making him happy. Once he could feel the heat of her hand on his penis, he didn't care any more what was happening to him or how. He wanted more of her touching him, more of her loving him and loving him. He was finally happy to have her as a friend, as a friend and lover, as much as he loved her.</p> <p>As he tried to think of what to do, he felt his sister's hand on his shoulder and wondered what she was doing here. His thoughts were interrupted by something which would never have happened if she had had a chance to leave his room. He quickly looked around, and when he looked back to see where her hand was, there she was standing beside his bed, naked. He saw a flush on her face, her breasts pushed together by her arms as she knelt in front of him. But, with her hands on his shoulder, she leaned toward her breasts and leaned toward where her nipples.</p> <p></p> <p>Her shoulders, she was looking over his shoulders, like the head. He wanted his sister was on, he wanted to where his face and his face to his eyes—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
