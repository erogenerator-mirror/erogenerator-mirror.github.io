M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XII. A Solemn Vow and Promise</h4><p><strong>IT was not until the next Friday that Marilla heard the story of the flower-wreathed hat. She came home from Mrs. Lynde’s and called Anne to account. “Anne, Mrs. Rachel</strong>ss. When you are all the sweetest people around,” she said with an ironic smile. “We all make the perfect couple.”</p> <p>“I don’t know how I have made it like this. I never do. I’ll be a good girl again.”</p> <p>“I know. I just never make love to a girl just once. Don’t worry. Don’t worry. I love it when you make the first move. I just need to keep it in mind.”</p> <p>Anne was glad it was late for the party. If she wasn’t feeling horny, she was about to cum right there. Now she just wanted to suck her pussy off. And that’s exactly what she was going to do. She just wanted to lick and suck her pussy. She started sucking and licking Mrs. Lynde’s pussy the way that only she knows. It didn’t take her long to go over that first stage, and she did. When she got her pussy into her mouth, she went to town on it. Soon she had Mrs. Lynde in heaven, and then she gave Mrs. Lynde what she figured that an American girl should do. But Anne had other plans. She just wanted to suck her pussy, and not worry about the consequences. So she got her pussy into her mouth, but that was about it. She just needed someone to suck it, but that was about it. Anne couldn’t just do it because she had to get herself in the mood. She needed to make love so she could make it happen. She needed to make it. But she needed to have the words, and how to say. She needed to have the words to say what she wanted to say. She even had to have the words because her mouth was all she wanted to say.</p> <p>What she needed was for her to be open to having a man to love her. She needed to be happy. She needed to be happy. And she needed to feel loved. And once she had had her wish fulfilled, it was over. She needed to love.</p> <p>“Anne, I’m ready.” Anne whispered. She had to say all of it. She needed to be open to making love. And she needed to know how it felt for him. “I’m ready. I want you so bad.”</p> <p>“I haven’t been ready for you.”</p> <p>“I know. I missed you so much. I miss you too.”</p> <p>“Are you ready for me to make love now?”</p> <p>“Yes. I still have to get ready, but that’s good.”</p> <p>“Good. Let’s go back to my room. Let’s go to bed so that we can begin.”</p> <p>The house was empty, except for them, and they had another couple's party to attend. But this time Anne told everybody so well. The party she was having was special. And if that didn’t get her attention, she had no doubt that there were more people around. The last time she was there, she had been drunk, and had done a number on her partner. But now that she thought about it, she was more than ready.</p> <p>And when Anne climbed on top of him in the bedroom, she could barely keep her mind on her mission. She was horny as hell. She wanted more than anything to feel him inside of her. If it wasn’t that, there might be another time. If it wasn’t that. Then another time. Now this was just the beginning. They were going at it. If they were going at it right now, they wouldn’t be here before two weeks. They couldn’t even be there in time. Now they were going at it together.</p> <p>Anne climbed up on top of Mr. H. on the bed. She wanted him to feel her and suck her pussy the way into him in a gentleman as much as well. She wanted that much as much as she did Mr. She wanted just wanted to make the things felt and sucked him first things to feel for him inside of her were just to be.</p> <p>It was all day. It was just like that would be for him and see her.</p> <p>It had to her. as she wished him, for her. and knew to make love her and feel, and love.</p> <p>and her, for all love with her and make, all.</p> <p>and love and like now and take.</p> <p>For more and be just now when he, if. but love over and love him, oh. he. and be in love</p> <p></p> <p>and all he would do not, when, her , and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
