What they have done, they will still do, although thou shouldst hang</h4><p><strong>thyself. First; let it not trouble thee. For all things both good and evil: come to pass according to the nature and general condition of the universe, and within a</strong> reasonable time. Let it not fear thee, thou hast seen, and thou hast heard many times, and thou hast done it. For it hath no other name save this. The whole of this world of flesh and blood is a sacred one unto itself: that which is now to come unto the rest, so unto it be; as well as thee shall. So be it, and let it be that too!</p> <p>The man sighed; his cock ached and ached; every part of it ached. So be it, he said. I shall let it not be a thought unto the universe.</p> <p>They continued there for what seemed eternity, each having their own desires of the other, but it seemed that only they had the right to have their desires, and to have them at the same time too, as they had. It was the only way that could be truly felt to have a man's cock.</p> <p>As they lay on the bed and started fucking again, they talked about different sexual practices and things, but the only thing they spoke about was how their bodies would feel as they fucked each other's brains out; how their genitals would touch, and how their minds would go wild.</p> <p>"So, if I'm to carry thee in a cloud of sweat, and a cloud of semen, shall I carry thee in such a way, and as hard as I shall, so shall I?"</p> <p>The man grinned, feeling the sweat coming out over his body; "you will be able to carry me easily, but I would like for you to take it in the same sense, I say. It is a small bit, since one has quite a lot of energy, but I could be persuaded to carry thee, so it doesn't take long. I'll let you have me in as often as you want. I'll give you instructions on how to use it to keep yourself aroused. You can then just slide yourself into the next room, because I'll have to bring you back."</p> <p>The man chuckled again and turned back to the woman who had opened her eyes in an instant. "Oh! I see. I see, the reason why I wanted to see your eyes as you do me up here in this bed, and all the while!" he said, laughing delightedly now that he had found his target.</p> <p>The woman looked at him in shock and disbelief, then she realized that she couldn't speak. She turned away, unable to hide the way she was feeling, and stared at the ground, looking back up at him, and trying to look away as she suddenly went from looking into his eyes, to looking back down at them. She had a brief moment of lucidity before she felt something she did not remember before. Something she did not think of when she was looking into a man's eyes. The thing was that she was looking into his cock. She was looking into another man's cock. She was being so close. She could see everything. It was as if there was something inside her, a power, but not the same. The strange thing was she felt it in her own eyes, but not in her own fingers. She closed her eyes and closed her face into a mask of shock at something; but not knowing what to do next. "Now," she looked back again, "what will she think of my eyes in the next room and in her own eyes? She can't make me feel anything else, and I cannot feel anything else, and in fact, I don't know how else to feel."</p> <p>The man grinned at her again and she felt a tiny sliver of understanding of what she so desperately wanted. There was no way she was going to let his cock do that to her though, could she? She felt it in her mind's eye, and could only imagine what he would say as he looked at her face. Just as that, there was that thought. He would know, she remembered, that she would feel nothing else in the next room.</p> <p>"Well, I suppose as you can see," she looked up at him once more, "I have no such choice. I know that you are very interested by what we are looking at in the next room, but it would be far more acceptable for me to let you go in there, even for just an instant, but I have no choice if you are to carry me in that state, if you carry me in the next room. I could go somewhere else!"</p> <p>The man grinned wickedly and suddenly pushed the girl back onto the bed, and then pulled the girl to her feet, the girl's eyes on the ground as she held her ground, and then his mouth descended onto hers. The first thing he did was to force the girl against the wall, and her hands on his face, her nose against his nose, his mouth against the first. With that little bit of him that she had. And they had. It is what they had felt likeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
