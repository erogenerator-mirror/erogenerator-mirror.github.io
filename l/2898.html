And I want, I want to feel power like in the movies.</p> <p>So I told her of my fantasy, that which had started this story. She told me of her dream, so I told her of the time I had masturbated thinking her naked. And now she told me about her fantasy. Her dream is about having the power to become one with the flesh and blood of a woman, to be the flesh and blood of a woman's body. It is her fantasy, it can take place in the same way I would have my own fantasy. And it is so, so right! It is our fantasy, it can be shared in a way which is to be shared in an instant. As we say: a woman's mind is made of flesh and blood for our sexual desires alone and not with the outside world.</p> <p>And as she said of her fantasy, I said: the moment before I have masturbated fantasizing about her; our fantasies can come true.</p> <p>So, a few weeks ago I was thinking of her, when I had a very bad dream, because if I did not masturbate, her words in my mind, the moment she kissed my breast, the image of it is forever a memory! As I was thinking of her, I kept reading: I felt her breasts, she touched mine, as if we shared in the very first moment which we had been together.</p> <p>And she was there, I felt her, as I looked at her, as she moved against mine, as I kissed her neck and shoulders and her skin as if it were my own skin. She said: 'Let go,' I said, 'let me dream.'</p> <p>She pulled my top from my body and threw it towards the bedroom door. It was not a very sexy one at all. I did not find it very sexy in a strip. But it still looked sexy. As soon as I was naked, I laid on the bed, and began to stroke my pussy. It was so smooth, I wished it was mine! I lay on my back with my legs wide open. I began to think of her, as I thought of the way she looked me when I felt her, as I looked at her. Her body, her body, her body. She said: I feel your body, I feel you, as we kissed. I kissed her breasts, as I imagined that you kissed her breasts, I kissed her body, I kissed her in the way I imagined I kissed our bodies, as if it were a man's body, as long as I kissed her!</p> <p>Then I began to think of her in just the way she was in my dream. I wanted her inside of me. I felt her. I thought of her in the way I feel you, I wanted you inside of me! I kissed her breasts, she kissed my breasts, as a man kisses a woman, as a woman kisses you. I wanted her.</p> <p>And then as long as I was with her, I wanted her. I said: I want you to kiss me, like I am your body now. You can kiss me, you can take me, you can fuck me! And she did. We started to kiss, we kissed, this kiss was so right. It was so natural and unselfish. We became so natural. I felt the passion of our bodies merging together. That kiss was so good, so passionate.</p> <p>I think she had a dream, she thought of me, as she kissed me. It was so clear. It was so beautiful. So sexy. We didn't say any words, we just looked into each other's eyes as we kissed. It was so romantic! I felt her lips caressing my face. I felt her tongue licking my mouth.</p> <p>And as our lips touched, ohhhh, and I felt her tongue touch mine, I began to moan. I felt her tongue running my mouth. Ohhhh, I want you to feel me! I want you to feel me. I want you to make us feel each other.</p> <p>She kept kissing me, kissing me, just for a bit, with my nipples. I felt the warmth of her body on my body and her hair on my thighs. She felt my body, as she lay naked on the bed, she said: I feel your body, I feel your body. I kissed her breasts, I kissed her body, I kissed her breasts, as she lay naked on the bed.</p> <p>Then she began to move her body, as I watched from the window, as I felt her body, as my body felt hers. She kissed me and she kissed me, as I felt her body went to make me feel her passion. my arousal, her love. my pleasure. when I felt her desire. her love. I felt it the passion, I felt her desire, I can feel my arousalâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
