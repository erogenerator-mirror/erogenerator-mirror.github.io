The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,</strong> and stood in a split second, as though he were doing leg raises as a cross.</p> <p>"Ouch!" shrieked the corporal, and started to run like a rabid man. He looked on with a wince as the colt galloped to a point where even his horse-flesh had become invisible. Even in his armor, the soldier’s body gleamed and glowed from the exertion. He could see the colt’s cock rising in the tight breech of his breeches, and the soldier’s face flushed, and his breathing was rapid. The trooper knew to leave the saddle-top open, or it would be a matter of time before the colt arrived, and would be able to get at least one leg out.</p> <p>“Stop, soldier!” ordered the man, "Get in the stirrup. Move closer, and keep your head down, soldier!" The centurion looked with interest to the colt’s position. The colt could not keep his eyes off the soldier’s member, as thick and swollen as the man’s waist. In a moment, his gaze drifted down to watch, and when finally it reached the soldier's crotch, he started to move the stirrup away, but the colt’s leg stopped him from moving forward. The soldier looked back over his shoulder to see the colt’s horse slowly pulling its legs to straddle it, and then to the soldier whose member lay upon its end.</p> <p>“You’re right, sir,” said the man, "and it’s only a few inches bigger on the saddle,” before the colt’s hands grabbed his legs, grabbed the stirrup, and pulled him down to rest his pelvis on his shoulder. When the colt’s legs began to part, the centurion held his hands and placed them down on the soldier's head. Then the centurion raised his hand in the direction of the soldier’s chest.</p> <p>“Let’s try this again,” the soldier said, and the soldier’s head dropped down and he opened his mouth.</p> <p>The centurion pushed his face between the soldier's open thighs, and began to eat the soldier’s virgin hole. The centurion’ horse began to hump himself back into the soldier’s face, but it was the centurion who began to pump himself into the centurion. Soon the centurion’s head came up and his face smeared the centurion’s hair in his face. The centurion’s whole body stiffened, tensed, and he grunted his release. As the centurion’s hand went to his face, the centurion came with a loud roar, which was drowned out by the colt's hooves.</p> <p>The centurion was breathing hard from the exertion, and the centurion was trying to catch his breath as he leaned his head back against the horse. It was during one of these moments that the Centurion became aware that it must have been the soldier’s horse’s turn to come, because he was also being affected by the colt’s climaxes. “Why are you getting off this time?” he asked, as he rolled over to lie face to face with the centurion.</p> <p>“A little selfishly,” replied the centurion, "This will be fun. We will try a lot of things, and we have a wonderful place where we will share our cum together,” and his horse began to move toward him. The centurion began to raise his own hand to encircle the centurion’s head, and the centurion followed.</p> <p>The centurion’s hand made contact with the centurion’s head. As he reached a spot at which the centurion’s mouth closed over the centurion’s, the centurion’s hips pumped into the centurion’s mouth and off of his face. The centurion’ cock was in the centurion’s mouth, as the centurion’ lips began to stroke the centurion’ cock. The centurion, in an off-hand manner, began to suck up and down on the centurion’ stiff cock when the centurion had it in his mouth.</p> <p>The centurion was making a soft sound as he nursed the centurion’ cock, and the centurion was trying to hold back his orgasm, but the centurion’s mouth was relentless attention was on his. The centurion then lifted himself up a bit to gaze upon the centurion’s face and began to his mouth with the centurion’s own lips around the centurion’s cockhead.
