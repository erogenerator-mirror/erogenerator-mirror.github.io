Stubb’s Supper.</h4><p><strong>Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy</strong> yacht into the bay.</p> <p>We all wanted to make love, but the Captain had made it abundantly clear. He wanted a bit more than this boat was going to be. He made sure it was always ready and available for us to spend some time with.</p> <p>The boat was parked at the dock. The captain had secured both boats while we took the time to make some good fish food and drink. We’d just been to Stubb’s favorite restaurant where the seafood was excellent.</p> <p>“Are you planning on having a threesome with this man of yours?” he asked us.</p> <p>“That depends. You guys could do it,” I replied, trying to figure out how he knew that.</p> <p>“Good! I thought that my brother’s girlfriend was your girlfriend. She doesn’t have to have sex with you either. That’s why she hasn’t. That’s why we’re having fun. This is too big a thing to just do what we always planned. You know.”</p> <p>“I know. I can’t tell you how much I want this. But the idea of me doing it with you guys…that’s something I never thought would happen”</p> <p>I looked around to find we were alone. Then I smiled and pulled her towards me. I felt her soft lips touch mine. I’m not sure how long our kiss lasted, but when our arms circled our heads and the lips parted, I realized how horny she was.</p> <p>“I think we should go check about getting something to eat before we do anything else,” she whispered in my ear, her tongue slipping into it.</p> <p>“I don’t think we should do anything more that you and I did just now, right?” I replied. It still puzzled me just how I could want to do that.</p> <p>We headed back to the ship, and got ready to go. I took off the shirt that had been hanging from it’s knot. She quickly undid it with her teeth. It hung perfectly in front of me. She slipped her own top over her tits. I could see them moving around in little circles as she slid her arms into it. My cock was getting stiffer. There was no way I was going to keep this up.</p> <p>“You can take it off if you want,” I told her, reaching up to caress her tits with my hands, pinching her nipples between my fingers.</p> <p>“Do I have to?” she replied. “Do you want me?” she said turning away from me and turning onto her back, then her legs.</p> <p>“No. Come here.” I told her, taking her in my arms. We kissed again, tongues dancing inside our mouths. We’d always had a strong mutual fondness and desire for each other. It’d been a long time since we'd met, but I couldn’t think of anything we both needed more than this.</p> <p>I felt her mouth leave mine and begin to move downwards, over my neck. With only the top button of my shirt, she finally started to pull it off. My shirt fell open. I reached forward, holding her breasts as we began to grope. My hands made their way down towards them. I could feel her tremble as I gently cupped the firm globes. I began to kneed them in my hands. Her breathing began to increase. Her nipples were harder. My mouth found it’s way towards them. Her breasts and tummy were now slick with her desire.</p> <p>My lips were kissing one of them as my fingers parted her pussy lips, moving my tongue in. She was getting hot as our lips touched. My fingers continued stroking the lips. Her body began to squirm. Her breathing quickened. She pushed my face away from her.</p> <p>“I’m going to cum!” she whispered urgently. I removed my hand from between her legs and moved it so her thighs were on mine. I guided the tip of my cock against her pussy. With one strong push, her legs locked behind my body.</p> <p>“Now!” I shouted at her and we pushed ourselves together as if our very lives depended on each other. She felt my cock pushing into her. Her pussy was tight. She was moaning and writhing in my arms. I felt her clench it around me. I began to move in and out. I thrust. As I could feel her body move with me, my cock. I felt her.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>’t know when she knew it was as the first wave had this. I was a strong but the wave of my—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
