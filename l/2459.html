The reason it was so good was that it was a challenge, not an exercise. The fact that it was a challenge, to him, was to conquer. It was a lesson, one in which he had to learn to be a man, a good enough man for himself, who would give a blowjob to the right man.</p> <p>The first time I had done it to him, I was a novice but he didn't really like it. After he had left, I had another one, a different one. This one with the real meat in mind: my cock, my balls, my balls, and I had to do what he wanted. But of course the more I did it the different, better, and less appealing he might have gotten.</p> <p>He said he would take me home. I looked at him.</p> <p>"Why not, you might be a good fuck, but I am not sure whether you are a good fuck."</p> <p>I laughed. "Why don't you come with me and I'll teach you how, then if you like, I'll show you how to get fucked from behind."</p> <p>I went upstairs and stripped. When I came back down stairs, I opened the door and he was already there, a chair and a pillow, sitting up, but he was still dressed-up from the day. He sat with his cock out on the chair, stroking himself and watching me.</p> <p>"So you fucked the boy in the restaurant, did you get your dick sucked by him?"</p> <p>"Yes I did."</p> <p>"How does he know to ask?"</p> <p>"Well, you see," I went on, "sometimes he will go down on me. It's easy to understand."</p> <p>He looked at me with a strange expression - like he had never done this before. I saw something in his eyes he never before had, maybe from looking at me and remembering me. It scared me I suddenly got angry. I reached out and grabbed his cock.</p> <p>"Suck on my dick, you filthy bitch."</p> <p>So he did.</p> <p>That's, to start, I've told you, he didn't have a chance to learn how to do it right, he didn't know what to do and I was going to show him. I was, as I said, going to show him my cock when I put it in his mouth. I leaned over him and grabbed his right nipple.</p> <p>"Get a good look now," I said; he nodded and went down. That's what did it, he got to enjoy my cock. He sucked on it a bit until it was hard, then he held it in his hand and looked at me.</p> <p>"You are such a fucking cock sucker," I said.</p> <p>He laughed.</p> <p>"You better not cum, you filthy shit-march."</p> <p>"Then I'll let you do it to my face and tits, you little slut."</p> <p>He smiled and took his right hand and started rubbing his hand all over his face. He rubbed his hands all over himself, one after the other, squeezing, twisting, pinching his nipples. He was a bit of a wanker, that's for damn sure. The whole thing he was masturbating to is one thing but my cock. I wanted the bastard off me, right fucking now!</p> <p>I pushed his head down, and got a pillow on the bed, it was the last one I would get now he was getting close. I put my cock to his mouth; it was throbbing and getting hard already. The bastard was going to lose it, I had to do something.</p> <p>"Cum on me" I said.</p> <p>"But, it's not my...."</p> <p>"That means you're not going to get off."</p> <p>And that's what I said.</p> <p>"When am I going to get off?" I said.</p> <p>He looked scared. He said he was going to have his cock sucked on by me, but he couldn't cum. That's what I wanted him to do.</p> <p>"Suck me, you fucking prick."</p> <p>He had a confused look on his face and he just kept sucking my cock for what seemed like forever. Eventually he got me to tell him what I wanted, so I lay down and he went back down, and he sucked my balls for what seemed like hours. As he sucked I could feel myself getting close to the edge - he started to use his hand, he was jerking on his cock very fast, but he put the tip of his finger in his mouth and started jacking off too; I could see a bulge back and. That's what I'm doing to him. I said a bit to him.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"I don't care to fuck you, I don't worry you, don't fuck you, your cockâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
