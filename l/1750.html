A BRIDAL NIGHT.</h4><p><strong>A few moments later our poet found himself in a tiny arched chamber, very cosy, very warm, seated at a table which appeared to ask nothing better than to make</strong> a point. A bit of a joke. A lot of it was good. A bit of a joke.</p> <p>"Well, hello. Welcome to your new home, Ms. Stone, I'm your guest."</p> <p>"And you are?"</p> <p>"I've never been happier than you're going to become; but there's quite a catch. After being a virgin, I want to move on with my life."</p> <p>"This is your life? Oh, and why do you even care?"</p> <p>"This is my life. I'm going to make it my living and I'm going to come to the best of my ability. So what can I say, I'm a little shy."</p> <p>"Come here," I said standing, and kissing her. She responded enthusiastically, and we enjoyed our brief little peck. "My, you are a lovely one."</p> <p>"Thanks," she said and we went to her bedroom. The room looked to be lit by a small fire, but she didn't notice it at first. She seemed to think it was mine rather than the fire.</p> <p>I kissed her some more and unbuttoned the top few buttons of her blouse. She took her hands and removed it for me, revealing some pretty sexy bra. The bra matched perfectly, and we found ourselves feeling pretty aroused by the minute. She unbuttoned my shirt and worked it out of my jeans before pulling it out of my slacks and sliding her hands inside it.</p> <p>She cupped my ass with both hands and then ran her hands up my back and squeezed my butt. She pulled my pants and underwear down and off, leaving an unmistakable erection. She looked at me and then at her bra, and I saw she had a very large pair of breasts with a dark, almost milky skin. They had a good sized areola and very hard pink nipples. Her hands trailed down her body and were touching my breasts.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," is all I could say. As I leaned down, my lips met hers and her hands ran through my hair, which I was feeling quite enjoyed. It felt like they were doing everything possible. We explored each others bodies, and I was a little amazed at her experience, which I found was quite surprising.</p> <p>She started undoing my shirt and I helped by unbuttoning and untying my shorts, which she removed to reveal a pair of very large breasts, with a very hard red nipple in a pink areola that got the most attention. I took my hands and gently caressed her breasts, but she took her hands and held me back.</p> <p>"Don't you dare touch me with just your hands," she warned. "You have only your mouth, tongue and lips." With our clothes lying on the ground, I pulled off her black bra, and my hands trailed down her soft skin and found her crotch. I took her nipple and gently massaged it, and she sighed, and reached down and placed her hands inside my panties. I was now feeling the moist lips of her vagina. She seemed very soft and warm and very wet on my fingers, and I felt my cock getting even harder, which made me feel even more aroused.</p> <p>"Go deeper now," she instructed, and I found she had a tiny opening to my finger. She felt the hardness of my hand and inserted her fingers in, and she stroked it as she fingered herself. I brought her to a full climax by fingering her. She seemed to enjoy my touching her more, and I could feel that she was a little sensitive down there myself, so I decided I would bring her off again.</p> <p>I sat on the bed, and she climbed on top of me and straddled my lap, facing me now and starting to stroke my cock. Her tongue went around my head and she pulled her mouth away from my body a little, then went back to her licking. Her lips glided along the shaft of my erection, and then I felt her lips touch me again and she kissed along the shaft, then kissed her way up my body. She kissed and kissed and kissed me, and I was almost able to orgasm, but there were no barriers as far as I was concerned. I kissed her as well as she kissed me, exploring her body as well as mine.</p> <p>When we finally came apart, and she had her eyes closed in post-orgasmic bliss, I said, "Can I ask you something?"</p> <p>"Of course," said her mother, "but I wouldn't know what to say. I just wanted you to know I enjoyed your little kiss with your lips."</p> <p>"I'm very happy and I will always will say how I'll like that and will always be your friend and I feel very happy."</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes, so and I am very happy and I hope of course to be very happy asâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
