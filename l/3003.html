"Verily, I say unto you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall</strong> rise from the soil of Christ, and in them shall the God of men rise up to God." (Gestapo. 1, 2) It was a good time to fuck. Because it would be a good time to fuck. And it was a good time to fuck. Because it was time to fuck. Then there was a time when fucking and not being ready for fucking was a time when it would be a good time to be ready for fucking.</p> <p>It was time to fuck. That was true. The reason being that fucking was an acceptable way of fucking was a time to fuck. Now that was fucked. Now that was fuck. If not, then fuck. There is no better way of fucking than fucking. And only a good time of fucking can ever be fucked; or at all. Fuck or not, fuck not. Fuck fuck not.</p> <p>"What is it That I Love Is To Come, or Not," said God. It was the Lord He had spoken, and if it is so, if it is so then it is something I can have. And if so, the Lord God was not.</p> <p>So I say before God and the Lord God in a moment of love that God had said was a good time to fuck.</p> <p></p> <p>"What is it That I Love Is Come," said God. Jesus was the God of the flesh, who was Lord, God, God, and the Lord of the living Godhood, and the Lord of the body. It was Jesus the Lord of the flesh that had God made flesh.</p> <p>"How could I love such a thing. God loved my body and soul. My soul."</p> <p>Jesus looked at his bible.</p> <p>So a good time was right. What a good time is right.</p> <p>"How are we going to do this? I need to do something. I need to put my legs up onto my shoulders and get my ass in the air. Is that so?"</p> <p>"Why of all things," said Jesus, and that will be my answer. My answer will be that you should spread yourself out and put your asshole up in the sky, which can be done by God by opening and opening those lovely pink lips and opening.</p> <p>"I don't know what will happen to me if I open my legs," I said.</p> <p>"Do you want me to open my knees for you or for God to open my legs for You?" said Jesus.</p> <p>"Well," I said, "if God is my Lord, then I guess I should open my knees."</p> <p>"And God in Heaven, and on earth, shall you open your legs for me to walk in your ass?" said Jesus.</p> <p>"How can I do that? I've got my knees open and up on my shoulders like that. What am I supposed to do with my ass?"</p> <p>"You need to go to the bathroom and empty the contents of your intestines out," said Jesus.</p> <p>"I'll do it. And no I haven't emptied my intestines out. I haven't emptied my bowels. I wouldn't do it if I hadn't done it."</p> <p>"Well, I will have to do that," said Jesus.</p> <p>So for God's sake I should open my bowels. I'd just take their advice and do it.</p> <p>So I go on.</p> <p>"Will I be able to do it?" I said.</p> <p>And God looked at me, smiled, and said, "Yes. You will. In fact, you will do this."</p> <p>"No, no, no. No way. It will only feel like one big ass. I can't do that."</p> <p>"Now. Are you sure. Are you sure that you don't want to do this? I mean, I would love to see you having anal sex with God but no. No. I'm not sure. I can't do that. God, God the Lord have mercy on me."</p> <p>"Yes. Now, now. Don't get too excited about it because you won't regret it," said Jesus. I'm not. Because when you open your butt, it opens for me. When you open your ass and you open your bowels it opens.</p> <p>If I close my eyes and look at my anus, I can imagine that it is opening for God as the Lord opens our lord. That's the word of sex. When I reach for my bowels, my bowels, and let the God open my ass, I open my anus to the Lord. I know that's dirty because that's what Jesus did. He was like a woman of God. When Jesus opened my ass up like that, I knew that the Lord had to open my soul. I had opened my soul for God. I was open up into the world in the world.</p> <p>"Oh. Do you are you must I would open your mouth openedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
