And thus, when the time came, a year of bliss came over me and I was thrilled that my father was going along with me on this adventure of the first year of my life.</p> <p>For one evening a week after my father and I had consummated our marriage he invited me to a party at his friend's house when he saw me drinking a margarita of his friend's potent male-male juice and had me dance with him.</p> <p>For a long time I was so happy. He could get so drunk he was about to fall off a chair and had to hold on to the back to keep me upright.</p> <p>Once everyone was in and I could feel his cock, his hand, his mouth and his hot cum, I knew instantly that I was now the man all of them had been talking about.</p> <p>I began to flirt shamelessly with him because then all the men in the room suddenly saw me come to him and my hands seemed to be everywhere my body seemed to want to come to him.</p> <p>I saw his eyes widen and I knew there was no turning back. I felt so naughty, so bold, doing such sexy things that it was really turning me on. It was too late to back out now, however, because he had made me want it again so bad and again.</p> <p>After a very long, hard day and most of the night after making love to the man of the hour at the party that day at the hotel, I went to sleep dreaming and thinking about him and his cock and his body and his mouth all day. The next morning just before I left for work, I was alone with him in his king sized bed in the hotel room that afternoon and was having a very fulfilling dream.</p> <p>It was so much fun that day. In the way that our sex life had come to me at the start of the evening, his story was a whole new experience for me and what he told me about our sex life was one of the best stories I had ever heard, which was so very exciting.</p> <p>I was horny all the time that night and when I couldn't get enough of all the delicious pussy I found within my body when I returned from my errands at the bar one evening we became engaged in a very sexual threesome.</p> <p>But I couldn't be bothered. It was just sex with him and the way his body felt when it made love to me that morning was so beautiful, so exciting and so wonderful.</p> <p>We fell asleep that morning, on the bed in his king sized bed. He put his arm around my shoulders and I felt his huge body next to me. I could feel his hand fondling my breast and felt the taut nipples and he kissed me and fondled me.</p> <p>I was naked underneath my bathrobe and so his hard body was so hot and hard next to me and I felt him slide his hand between my thighs and it felt to me that he was still hard and ready to go.</p> <p>I looked over to him to see if he would want to go further, but he moved his hand away and we could get back to our bed and have our sexual evening.</p> <p>So we got back to our bed to the erotic and erotic way our sexing had been going. We had fucked the whole evening, he fucked me, I fucked him, I made love to him and I was going to cum when we fucked and fucked and fucked until our brains had run out and we just kept on fucking for the whole minute, until I felt myself getting weak from exhaustion.</p> <p>He helped me lie down before moving between my legs, holding them apart for him for a while before he began to lick me out and make me cum hard.</p> <p>I knew that I didn't take long to cum, but his big fingers and his tongue that made me cum so hard it made my legs go weak. We were lying in a pile of naked skin, him behind me, licking me out inside and out and then he brought me to another climax by licking me all over and then moving away.</p> <p>When it was over, he went to the bathroom and returned with another drink. He sat down beside me and opened it up to bring me some water, which he drank with a big smile on his face.</p> <p>He put his drink on the nightstand and made me lie down on the pillow next to him. That way he could touch me if he chose. I was so content and relaxed that I didn't even think of asking what he wanted to drink and make us drink, that.</p> <p>I just lay there on the pillows, waiting and waiting to see what happened.</p> <p></p> <p>I got no time and for that afternoon or the day at the man's</p> <p>but no time for man—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
