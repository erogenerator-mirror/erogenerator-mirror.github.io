Grouchy hoped for, Blücher arriving. Death instead of life. Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was</strong> time too. He had never been around people like this before, let alone a celebrity but now he was surrounded by a dozen celebrities and two Women.</p> <p>"Who's your favorite actor?" Blæver asked the most beautiful person in his life.</p> <p>"My favorite actor," he replied back.</p> <p>She looked so beautiful, he could not wait to get her out of that ugly hospital gown.</p> <p>"Don't you have to go to the police?"</p> <p>"Yes," she replied back with that innocent look.</p> <p>"It's a joke," he replied, "It's a police line." That's when it hit him. Everyone in the room, including Blæver, was laughing and laughing!</p> <p>"Shit, I hope no one here is gay, I really could use a guy to cover up a bit..."</p> <p>But she had seen the look in his eyes, the way they narrowed a bit every time she looked close.</p> <p>"I'd prefer no one's touching me," she replied, with that soft and tender and loving tone just like a cat.</p> <p>"Good point," he sighed. "And I would very much love one from you. I can't believe we've got to get a date!"</p> <p>"You'll make a great boyfriend," she winked back, "Don't you want to see me?"</p> <p>"Definitely!"</p> <p>"Well then, we're going to celebrate! Now, I think I'll go get the movie!"</p> <p>"It sounds like a lovely date." Blæver was enjoying her company so much he could barely speak for her.</p> <p>"It is!"</p> <p>With that she turned around and kissed him, and he did too, and just like that time before, they were kissing.</p> <p>He took her hand and guided her into the backseat where the movie was and they took the movie to the back. Just like that time of darkness before, they got the tickets and went home. That's when he took her from her hands to his lips and kissed her so hot and tenderly and hungrily.</p> <p>They undressed each other's clothes and he laid her on the bed and made love to her sweet and wet pussy. She was so wet...so ready for him.</p> <p>He didn't make her wait too long as she started to buck and moan her pleasure. "Oh yeah baby," she said between sucks as he nibbled and sucked on her clit, "that's it for you. You make me come so fucking hard!" With that another squirt of warm fluid went all over his lips as she was still coming.</p> <p>"Thank you, thank you," she responded to him as she held his head and let him fuck his sweet tongue and mouth with that sweet creamy substance.</p> <p>"I'll let someone else wash your hair for you then," he smiled. "We have company here, we'll leave it alone."</p> <p>"That sounds like fun to me."</p> <p>He led her to the bathroom and they left their clothes and their kiss in the room while he washed his face and brushed his teeth. They then sat in the sunken tub together, her leaning against him while he scrubbed his hair.</p> <p>"Do you remember all that nasty and sexual stuff that happened at school?" She asked, "You were such a slut!"</p> <p>"Yeah, sorry, you were so hot to me too," he chuckled, "I never wanted to stop doing what I was doing in class."</p> <p>"So, were you ashamed about what happened?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I was too ashamed," he replied.</p> <p>"...to tell you the truth," she said, rubbing his shoulders.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, but you should at least be comfortable with yourself. You could do something for someone and just make them feel better!"</p> <p>"I would be happy to do that, but...I shouldn't," she replied.</p> <p>"No, you shouldn't, and you don't do this to me or anybody else," he smiled and kissed her. "But I want you. Right here, right now...anywhere, I want you."</p> <p>"Okay." Her eyes were full of a lust for him that he could never hope to conquer. She wanted him, but also she knew this was wrong.</p> <p>"Shit, I've never even tried anything before," he said with his cheek as he looked into her eyes. "Would you...you really enjoy it?"</p> <p>"Yeah!" She replied. "It's not as if you did it for me...you know, even..."</p> <p></p> <p>" "</p> <p>"Do you can never, never." "</p> <p>" " not," she said, I really, I'm, I know I...I mean, " if you know—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
