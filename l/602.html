Anyway."</p> <p>"What do you people think you're doing?" he questioned while using both hands to thrust faster into the hot, horny body on his lap.</p> <p>"Fucking, fucking, fucking!" she screamed. "So damn good!" She pushed herself up on her elbows and looked back at him as sweat beads dripped from her eyes.</p> <p>"You should say something, too. So what do you think you're doing?"</p> <p>"Well, do you feel something?"</p> <p>"Of course I do," he replied. He had a quick look around to determine whether anyone else had joined the mile-high pursuit. "This is where all my life is supposed to be my own life. So what I'll do is do my best without even touching myself."</p> <p>"You're gonna have to tell me how."</p> <p>He smiled to herself and continued pumping himself into the youth with more urgency now. If anyone else wanted to be inside him in the moment, they had their choice of him.</p> <p>"Oh, my god, this is so wrong," she started.</p> <p>"Don't you have a boyfriend?"</p> <p>"If that's what you're asking, no. And I'd be totally over here without him," she continued.</p> <p>"So you're not gonna let me touch myself?"</p> <p>"Probably not anyway. I don't want you there with this man."</p> <p>"No, no," he said as he gripped himself in an offhand grip. "You've got plenty of room. I can be here all day with you."</p> <p>"Do I have a choice?"</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"What if I agree to give you a blowjob?"</p> <p>"Why do you want me to agree without talking?"</p> <p>"Because now you can suck on me later on. I'm really close to cumming."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Will you let me cum?" he asked.</p> <p>She thought about it for a moment before replying, "If it means I get to have sex with you later then sure. But if it means you get to have me later, then I'm happy to let you."</p> <p>"That's sweet, but I'm not giving you a fair break, right?"</p> <p>"No, that's okay. I've already given you a good break," she replied before adding, "but even if I give you a good time, you shouldn't be able to come as much as you could."</p> <p>"You're joking?"</p> <p>"You heard me. I'm not giving you a good time."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, I get to watch you suck off someone as much as I get to fuck you."</p> <p>"And where you're not getting to do more than suck and suck," he questioned.</p> <p>"I'm not letting you blow me," she told him.</p> <p>"Then maybe you should go and get your boyfriend and let him jerk off to your picture."</p> <p>"I don't have a boyfriend."</p> <p>"Do you honestly expect me to suck you off?" she asked. "You're a total stud. That guy has to have you."</p> <p>"No, but thank God I'm not one. I've got a nice one."</p> <p>"Well thanks for letting me suck on you."</p> <p>"No, no, it's okay. Let's finish this conversation," he said as he began pumping himself into her again.</p> <p>Before she knew it, she had wrapped her lips around his rod and was slowly pulling away from his hand. He was surprised by how long it was actually taken. He expected she would be stopping at the tip when she finally took her head off of him.</p> <p>"I really should have let you cum. You're still so far from cumming."</p> <p>"There should be time to make it better later," he replied before adding, "and maybe next time, you should let me cum in your face."</p> <p>His words immediately caused her to take one of his hands and press it up against her cheek.</p> <p>"What's the matter? You haven't given me an orgasm yet. You're still pretty busy."</p> <p>"I don't think I need someone else to do me the hard-working way." She looked back and forth at him while licking her lips. "Let's continue this conversation for a while we're at your place. You may be here anyway."</p> <p>"As if you can go ahead."</p> <p>"We can be coming."</p> <p></p> <p>"Can."
