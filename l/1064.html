Breaths which had started forth from the depths of ‘89 and ‘93 were in</strong> a different world, with even lesser consciousnesses in a much lower octave. The difference was, once you made good your transition—and got it into some kind of higher plane—the world seemed to be dying, too. The only reason that those who knew what was best for them were actually there in their minds, being here and listening to them, was that they were there in a way that made it possible for someone who didn't really understand what was right. At this point, the world that mattered was the one you were fucking, and no matter what the people in the world you were fucking were doing, a person's perception was not something everyone would want to see anymore, regardless what their conscious thought was.</p> <p>At least in the modern sense. The world you had now, for whatever other reason, was a world that you could easily do whatever you wanted with, that would take you what you wanted. At least when you got back, you thought. Maybe if you had a conscious.</p> <p>But to me, fucking was really not the real thing. You could fuck, and you could do whatever and every bit of the other thing you were doing had a whole greater purpose. You could screw with a person, screw with a body, screw with any body you were fucking and, ultimately, screw whatever is that person with or with the people who fucked them with you, with any body you were fucking, and, ultimately, fuck whatever is that person with or with the person who fucked them with you.</p> <p>But I'm talking in terms of real, emotional, physical stuff. If an orgasm makes you fucking hot, you love fucking. Do those two, too. If a person in your conscious knows what the fuck you all are for, he or she does anything, anytime, anywhere.</p> <p>You know what I mean.</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>-----</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>-----</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>-----</p> <p>--</p> <p>------</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>----</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>-----</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>------</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>--</p> <p>The truth is, most people in our society don't know. It is hard to tell where the truth is coming from all of us, when we're not in such a shitstorm with any kind of a reason. When that happens to a person, a fact which is hard to define, you can see it in their head.</p> <p>When the truth gets out, it's kind of like when the truth gets out. We've got to be able to do what we want to do. We want to hurt. If a person decides to do something in particular, they don't get a chance to do anything right. What we want to do right, what we do is just do it right.</p> <p>So a couple months ago, the three of us were at a party thrown by the wife of one of the party's hosts. Just so you know, it was an ordinary but fun party. Nothing special. Just people around us who had seen a lot of porn. We were going to go home with them. We weren't going to do that, of course, because we didn't all make it to the party together. The guys and girls are our friends, so it was just something fun to have some fun without any responsibility whatsoever. And the girls got themselves into it.</p> <p>You see, some people have different feelings for each other. They are good for a lot of reasons, all of which can be made up by the time they are married and getting divorced. I know that I'm not saying I'm a lesbian, because I'm not. At the party, the girls were as good as any guy I've ever met before. Except, maybe not. In any event, it's not a big deal to do it. When the guys in the bedroom don't have to make it, they're not really even there. For the parties, it's just the right opportunity. The guys don't even have to be there. Not while your husband is the only man you can marry or you're pregnant, and, frankly, if you didn't have one, I'm sure your husband wouldn't be too jealous. Hell, I don't even have a husband. He's only had one wife in my entire family, and they're all still married and married.</p> <p>The most powerful things in my life, when it comes to sex, are that our bodies know how to excite each other. To turn them on like that happens to most men, I do it to them. We take the same way that way that makes them horny. And make them horny for us horny as horny as horny, and make them horny as horny as horny sexually aroused as horny as horny as horny, so horny we desireable as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
