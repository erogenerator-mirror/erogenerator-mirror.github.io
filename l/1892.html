How easy a thing is it for a man to put off from him all turbulent</h4><p><strong>adventitious imaginations, and presently to be in perfect rest and tranquillity!</strong></p> <p>She is lying there, her head to the sky, surrounded by some clouds, looking up at me, her breasts up in the sky, and her long dark hair spread out on the bed, as if with a thousand tiny birds singing in the night sky. Then she slides her left leg out over the bed, which is parallel to mine, between my legs. Now, her foot is on top of my thigh, at eye level to me, where only her knee meets. I can't see if she is asleep or alive, but I can feel her leg on my leg, right next to mine. I'm too engrossed into our moment of sexual intimacy to notice, or care what happens next. Only, it's too late to worry, though I do. Right there, right when I'm about to cum, her leg slides down and, still lying beside me, she pulls my boxers down. My penis enters her warm, welcoming, vagina. There are no lights or other sounds, only her breathing. I feel her vagina contracting on me, then relax as, just as I am, and, just as I wanted, too. Her eyes are closed. Her lips are moist. I slide into her, deeper, deeper into her, until she's all the way down and all the way up. Then she starts moving, slowly at first, then faster and faster. My penis slips into her vagina as if with a jolt. She's holding me with one hand, using the other to hold me on top of her. When I reach an orgasm, I don't want our bodies to end up tangled as we climax in a stormy sea of ecstasy.</p> <p>We sleep. We sleep for ten minutes until we wake up in the morning. Now my penis is erect again inside her sex. Then I reach for her, slip my hand under her arm, around her body, inside her vagina. Our skin slips together and our genitals slide around each other in the narrow, narrow, narrow passage of sexual union. I slide my penis in and out of her vagina, faster, harder again. Her eyes are closed. Her breasts are up and out. My penis has reached a new level of hardness and thickness, now. I've lost the ability to resist.</p> <p>But, then, I know I'm not dreaming. My penis is fully hard and fully erect and, in fact, I'm getting excited, too. I'm moving up and down the length of her vagina. She's moving with me. My penis goes up and down in her vagina. My penis slides all the way up inside her. My penis slides all the way down inside her vagina. Our legs are still intertwined as if I'm trying to go deeper than my penis ever could go. Our naked bodies are sliding all the way around each other. Finally, our sexual union slows for a while. We're both tired, and we're still breathing heavily and breathing hard, as if we have had one long, sensual night. Then I slide my hand down to her vagina and start touching her clitoris. Her vagina is wet and warm and, finally, I don't know where I ended up where I did when we fell asleep.</p> <p>She's still asleep. Or perhaps I'm still asleep. I'm inside her vagina. I'm still inside her vagina. We've made love many times in the bed since we were together. Before, I thought I could resist, but now, I'm not so sure. All my resistance has ended. Well, I can give up and wait for more of it to begin. After all, we're already having sex. If we're still sleeping, I still want more of that, so, so very much. I keep fucking my beautiful and sexy and naked goddess mother with my penis. As much as she wants more than I can provide.</p> <p>I stop for a second. Then I move my penis out of her vagina and stand up, pulling my boxers off. I stand beside her naked self. We're still naked as if we were only standing there with her holding me in her arms while we're having sex. Then I give her a final stroke, one of love, while she kisses me. I kiss her. She kisses me. I kiss her. And, she kisses me. Finally, I let her go and, on hands and knees, I pull all my clothes off. Then I crawl between her open legs. As soon as I enter her vagina, she pushes me inside her again. After we get used to me being inside her vagina, and we're both relaxed, she tells me to lie down on my back. I lie on top of her without any resistance. After my penis slides in and out of her vagina, we lie still touch each other parts of each other by ourselves, without an inch or by inch. She lies on one and the other.</p> <p></p> <p>I go in my penis.
