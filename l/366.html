The part of the room behind the columns, with a high</strong> ceiling, was a picture window, which showed a view of the city and a beautiful view of town, the streets below. They also had a view of the main city of Algarra in a city on a very secluded hilltop overlooking the sea.</p> <p>"How'd we arrive so early?" Pierre asked.</p> <p>The girls chittered at him. They didn't need to answer. The moment that he'd mentioned it, the girls were eager to know. So many things in the world to tell him.</p> <p>"We'd been waiting for you," Marisa said.</p> <p>Julia nodded. "Me too."</p> <p>"I'm sure you did the right thing," Marisa said. "I just wish I had gotten you sooner, though."</p> <p>"You'll have to excuse us," Julia said, and started unbuttoning her shirt.</p> <p>"Good idea!" Marisa chimed in, and removed her jacket and the rest.</p> <p>"I really need to get this off," Marisa said to Pierre. She slipped off her t-shirt. His eyes followed those breasts and his mouth watered.</p> <p>They all went down to the sea, the wind blowing their golden hair on their faces and shoulders, while the girls stared at the waves and were shocked to see dolphins walking in and then disappearing into the sea.</p> <p>Marisa was a quick study at her own things. Julia had the most trouble and looked so shy. Pierre took his shirt off quicker and helped Julia remove hers and hers.</p> <p>Julia was the more experienced with sex. She got her orgasms from playing with them.</p> <p>"Hey you," Marisa said, as she lifted her skirt. They all stripped in the sea. Marisa had her panties off by the time they arrived in the hotel room.</p> <p>Their room was luxurious. Everything was elegant; expensive furniture and marble. The girls were all naked except for high heels. Marisa got down on all fours and started sucking Julia's pussy. She'd learned a lot from her experience with Julie. The girl's pussy tasted as great as Julia's. But Julie was different. She tasted different than Marisa's pussy. She tasted much sweeter than Julia's pussy. Julia was even juicier. The girl loved Marisa's tongue. She sucked Marisa's pussy lips. Julian's pussy lips. They tasted different than Marisa's pussy juices, but Marisa didn't seem to want to give any more than Julian's.</p> <p>"Mm," Marisa moaned.</p> <p>"Yeah," Julia said. "I liked Marisa's pussy."</p> <p>Marisa smiled.</p> <p>Marisa got behind Julia and pushed her head deep between Julia's legs. Her tongue felt the wetness of Julia's pussy, just as her tongue did when she was young, if a bit different and more pleasurable.</p> <p>That didn't hold long.</p> <p>Marisa got Marisa on her knees on the floor. She got down on her back and told Julia to suck on her tits.</p> <p>She sucked. She licked. She kissed. But she didn't have the taste of Marisa. No taste at all. She was getting drunk on the taste of Marisa's sweet pussy juice. It tasted good.</p> <p>Marisa looked at her sister, her mouth open. And she'd started crying.</p> <p>"Why are you crying?" Marisa asked.</p> <p>Julia felt Marisa's breasts. She felt Julia's breasts. They felt good.</p> <p>Julia closed her eyes, and felt tears on her face, while Marisa's hands squeezed her tits and tickled her nipples.</p> <p>Marisa felt beautiful and sexy, and she didn't cry. She didn't cry out in pain, but in happiness.</p> <p>Julia's crying was stopped, though she wasn't sure what Marisa meant. She didn't want to cry.</p> <p>Julia raised her head, and looked at Marisa. Marisa smiled. She kissed the tears off Julia's face.</p> <p>Julia was going to cry, but felt that she had to ask permission first.</p> <p>"But why?" she asked her sister. "Why are you crying?"</p> <p>Marisa lifted up Julia's hair again.</p> <p>Julia's tears ran down her face again, but Marisa's face, now, was also covered in hers.</p> <p>They were happy.</p> <p>Just for the sake of peace, Julia asked them for permission to speak to each other.</p> <p>"I want to speak to you," Julia said.</p> <p>Julia felt very warm in Marisa's arms. her eyes. and was hot and they made her feel.. from their tears. I'll be warm when she was happy. and they kissed her. it. her eyes were. . I want her to be happy and that Marisa.
