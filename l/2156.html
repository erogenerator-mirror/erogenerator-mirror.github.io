That soul which is ever ready, even now presently (if need be) from</h4><p><strong>the body, whether by way of extinction, or dispersion, or continuation in another place and estate to be separated, how blessed and happy is it! But this readiness of it,</strong> it being the very first time I've had this, it, it, I, it, is so fucking wonderful! My cunt, all the time, now for some, no-one, no-one. Fuck me, fuck me. Fuck my hot, wet little cunt! Fuck me, fuck my horny little fuck-hole...</p> <p>I had to get it out of there before I burst into tears.</p> <p>"Fucking fuck... fuck me! Fucking fuck... fuck me! Fuck me!" (This is where it makes me feel even richer...!)</p> <p>I was moaning, groaning, pleading with my cunt. But I still wanted a man of his own! I was trying hard, trying to fuck him now, trying to be the lover of his flesh!</p> <p>I'm standing. My body is all over it. I'm looking at myself in the mirror. And with the one hand, I'm reaching for my cunt, with my mouth to be fucked, but a bit behind me, I'm making my cunt open even more to the air as I reach down with my mouth. That my cunt's made for fucking. And it feels great! Not as good as when my hubby did all the work, but I'm so damned horny, even more, just feeling it. The heat of me, as the sex goes on! Oh, God! It's all the way in! I'm stretched so far. Oh, yessss! It's all way in! All right! Now! Hard! Now! It'll go in! Just a little at first, but, as it goes in, just a bit, just a bit... Just a bit more of it to open me wide, the fuckhole. Just a bit more!</p> <p>And this will go in and go in in and go in! This is so fucking good all that way in!</p> <p>It took a little while, but I was enjoying it, and I was enjoying it, really enjoying it! It took more than that. It took my whole belly! And if I said it felt so good, at the time, in that first moment a minute later, that it was good, if only I could have felt it, a moment later, I'd have loved it too!</p> <p>I wanted to say "fuck me" more, to "fuck me," but I'd better get on with this.</p> <p>Well... I know what that means, doesn't it?</p> <p>Anyway, as long as that's me, if it's going into me that good, if it's going inside me that good, then I'm happy.</p> <p>I'm looking at myself again in the mirror, and, sure enough, yes, right up. It's been so good!</p> <p>I'm now standing a few feet apart, and my cunt is right above it, so that my cunt is completely opened, and it's ready to be fucked!</p> <p>I'm holding my vagina open to it for a moment, and just for a moment I feel another finger on the opening, and I feel that, again, I'm being fucked there. It's in, it's all in, there's my cunt! Oh, yeah, there's all of it. I can feel that! I can feel all of it, now. It's all in! I'm being fucked! And even though I'm enjoying it, I can't think of my own body, because I've been lying there, being fucked there, being fucked, but it's so good!</p> <p>But as I say, I don't know how, but I know I like it, and I'm loving it. I think to say "oh... fuck me"... I think I should say "fuck me"... but I don't... I've never said anything like that, but what I do now, well, it's all over with it! I'm going to fuck! I'm going to fuck! I'm going to take it all! I finally said "fuck me"! I mean, it was just a question, was silly asking it, but it might have just been something I might like to do in the future, someplace, where we can do it ourselves rather than just having it on a camera lens.</p> <p>Oh, yeah, that was so good.</p> <p>But, I need to stop now, to do another, but not for me. I can't keep taking this so deep. I need to stop. My cunt wants me to continue. I need to go all the way. Let me go again a bit further. I need to go all the way, all the way!</p> <p>A bit further is too far, I suppose, if I go even further right this time. It's now. It's all the moment, isn't any moment, right, right now.</p> <p></p> <p>I'm all the moment, right now, I've it's all, rightâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
