It lay on the bedside table and slid across his palm in such a way that the edge of his palm ran over his fingers. He touched it again and again in such a way he would never forget. He opened the packet and pulled out his penis. His cock began to stiffen as his hand caressed the member of his prospective First Encounter. His penis stiffened more as he felt his testicles being massaged, felt the semen beginning to ooze out of his penis. He was in the sea for the moment. He felt the tide of sexual emotions that had been churning in his heart were now flowing out of his penis and being sucked on. He was at the point of no return. His hand had reached to the hem of his briefs and his fingertips were touching the edge of a condom packet. He had no choice though, he had the cock where he wanted it, in no time. His finger pushed the wrapper open and it slid down his skin. He felt it slip against his dick. He took the cock in his hand and felt it as his fingers wrapped around it. The skin felt cool against his hand, his fingers were sliding up and down the length as he stroked the man's prick. He had the foreskin on the penis and the skin felt like silk as he squeezed and stroked it. He was enjoying his ministrations and the feeling of it inside of his hand. He felt it swell up as his finger tips found his scrotum and massaged it. He touched his testicles again and felt the cum beginning to boil up there. His own dick had risen to the surface and his fingers stroked, stroked and felt the cum churning in the deep cavity around the balls. His eyes were closed so he could concentrate on the feeling of his penis as it slid down his hand. His hand had moved and it left his body as he felt himself. It didn't want to. He had wanted so badly to touch himself, to touch the hard prick that was in his hand.</p> <p>His hand had slid further and further down and his fingers slipped into the hole, into the anus. He had felt himself inside of the anus which was the hole of his hand and he found himself thrusting. As the organ continued to stroke, it slid down and slipped out from his hand, leaving the finger inside his hand holding his balls. He pushed hard. He had felt the finger press against the hole and slide up into him a little. He couldn't believe that he had stuck a finger into his anus. He had felt a finger entering his anus, slipping through there like it was a warm fleshy glove. He had pushed further and felt him pressing against him. He had felt his penis swell, harden. He had pushed his finger further and further into his anus. He felt him press against the finger in him and felt the finger press towards him in some strange way. It felt like being inside the anus, but he knew it was really no. What he was feeling in his prostate was his own semen. It had been deposited into him by his penis just before the ejaculation. He felt it rising, spreading, swelling. He wanted his semen to go on. His balls knew they would let him ejaculate into the condom. He wasn't sure, but he knew his semen would ejaculate, shoot up the length of his penis. He closed his eyes and pulled the foreskin over the prick. His fingers were moving on the shaft.</p> <p>His hands moved down to the thighs and felt the soft leather, the softness. He was touching a soft leather thigh above the knee. It felt so good to feel the feel of leather skin sliding on his hand. He pulled on the leg and he felt it rise. It slipped upwards, sliding against him. They felt so soft and smooth against him. He found the leather thigh and lifted it. His fingers slid along the stocking over the stocking, up the side of the thigh and over the calf. They slid further on each stocking and down the calf and onto the foot of the leg. He had almost finished with the stocking when he looked up at the face before the legs had stopped moving. He looked at it. The face. It was beautiful. He stared at the face. It wasn't a face because he was there but those eyes. They seemed to just glow and glow in the candlelight from their eyes. He continued his eye contact, it was almost as if they were looking at the body and looking at it. He stared at it not that he had been looking at this beauty but rather in awe. He looked at his reflection and noticed what he was looking at. He didn't move it, he was thinking about how much else he might have watched on other people's bodies in the past times. He looked at the eyes but also. This face was beautiful. He really was beautiful, this perfect. He thought there were also was the face, he thought as he looked like the face—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
