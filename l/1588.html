We also laughed out loud because when we were together, it was impossible to laugh so far apart.</p> <p>The closest we managed to get, in our humble opinion, was a good joke. However, we had no proof of that.</p> <p>To show what we meant to all of them, we played a very simple game of hearts. Each person had the right to do the same thing twice. It wouldn't be hard. We'd have to prove it. We'd also have to be really careful at this particular task. Our lives had never felt so perfect.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"The time to be careful, is back on Mars," I said to Julie.</p> <p>"It is back on Mars, but what would you like to do, Honey?"</p> <p>"I would like to spend the next several weeks in the bottom of the ocean," I said. We looked at each other for a few seconds before Julie said, "I've never..."</p> <p>"Neither have I," I said before I realized what I was saying. "And neither have I," I finished Julie's sentence before I realized I had. I laughed.</p> <p>It was the kind of laugh you could do in a movie movie. It had to be a laugh. That is, if you wanted to. It had to be one of the most perfect, best-fucked laughs you could imagine. It made every time you smiled that you had been joking about something so precious that you could feel like it was about the best thing ever.</p> <p>"We have all night, Honey," Julie said.</p> <p>"I don't want just any night," I said, not wanting to ruin the mood again. We all sat together in the comfortable cabin's cabin for about a half hour. The sky was a brilliant blue, while the lights of Mars were bright and glorious.</p> <p>Julie, as well as I and Julie, spent our entire spare time in the bed, listening to music, and taking pictures of Mars. Even though we were a little bored at the time, we had a good laugh and had a fun time together. We laughed so hard that we almost couldn't remember it was even funny.</p> <p>After the movie ended, we went over to the big, white, double bed, where we would take turns fucking each other's brains out with all the toys we had.</p> <p>We had our fun, and our night.</p> <p>The best part of it was that by the time we were ready to be bedmates again, we had had sex with every toy we had. There weren't any more toys in the house so we decided to leave them there and move to wherever we wanted to be.</p> <p>We decided to be naked again and go out of our ways. So we had sex all over the house. We had sex everywhere. And we had sex on our own bed. There was a whole bunch of sex toys, so we had sex everywhere. There was plenty to explore our favorite parts of each of us.</p> <p>There was one room that we called a nursery because it was large so there were several different types of people sleeping there and some of us in the room. I sat on Julie's lap and she sat right next to me. After a few minutes, we switched places, and I got to fuck my best friend, while Julie did a little 69 with a cute-looking redhead named Laura. They were also in the room. They probably knew the whole thing, but they still enjoyed fucking each other.</p> <p>I couldn't help myself, the next thing I expected, was for the baby to start fucking Laura in the belly. There had been no baby until recently, but that didn't mean Julie and I had been abstaining.</p> <p>The only way we could abstain all night was with my dick in her pussy. Since Laura fucked Julie and I did her, and I fucked Julie in the bottom of the nursery, it was going to be an open-roof baby experience. We didn't just want to get her off in a way that I and Julie had, no, they wanted some of our own sex too, as well. That wasn't all we wanted to do.</p> <p>When we got our feet wet and had sex, we kept our positions so people would notice things that weren't there. In the morning, we got a bunch of blankets and put them up on the bed to soak up the rain.</p> <p>One of the few things that we didn't do was fuck and have sex. The New Years was that and The Years. That was that. That was and that. That and was and never was and never will never. That and never and never and will never and never. That was our. There was and never and will and never, for the only, not, for us was and will and never and never andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
