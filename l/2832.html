It was only 3.45. At that time in London he left his room and went to his friend's flat. His friend was a young student working in the Economics Building. David was alone with some colleagues. He sat on the sofa and made himself comfortable. He told himself that only so long the people were always able to be alone with, even when they weren't.</p> <p>His mind drifted to his friend's comment about being able to do the same thing, in a similar way. They were friends of his. After all they had had it, even if many weeks apart.</p> <p>David opened the drawer of his nightstand and pulled out a small butt-plug. His friend told him to go get it but first he wanted a blowjob.</p> <p>He opened the top drawer and came out with a long dong dildo, about 6 inches long and of some thickness, about 1 inch in diameter. It had a long shaft with veins running along its underside. Its head was a bulbous red, with small vertical veins running along its sides and one side of that was pointing downwards, towards the floor.</p> <p>His mind was still clouded with thoughts of what he should do to this large dong stuck in his mouth. He was about to insert it when his head was jerked to life. He opened his mouth and found that the dildo was long – about 2 1/2 inch in diameter – and had some curved ridges, which he started rubbing along the surface of it. The dildo was really curved, about 1.25 inch when he was fully erect. His eyes opened and he took a lungful of air when the head of the dildo pressed against his opening.</p> <p>To his surprise, David put all his fingers around the shaft and started pressing himself around it as he opened his mouth, but then it happened; once. The head of the dildo slipped and entered his opening slightly, but before his consciousness was able to fully enter, David went back to his hands and began rubbing the shaft around his opening. This time he was able to enter as well, and he felt the tip, inside of his canal, enter his body. He had never felt anything so strong in his entire life, only the one time in high schools, when his boyfriend had tried to have sex, with his roommate, with a classmate, and he had stopped him – and what had been a quick but satisfying intercourse, had gone.</p> <p>After a bit of time, the shaft slowly moved in and out, the shaft went down and David got aroused, just as the head went in and his canal opened fully, and the shaft slid in easily. He was now fully in; he felt like he was about to get an orgasm from inside his body. He pushed the dildo all the way in and out, all the way to the base. His channel closed, and his body reacted immediately to the stimulation.</p> <p>It took more minutes for him to start to build up again. It didn't take long though, and soon his body was moving with his hand, which he was caressing, trying to match the movement of the dildo.</p> <p>The stimulation was getting higher the longer they were fucking, and the thrusting into his canal was quicker, as it made his canal become slick and slick – like a wet fuck. His hand caressed his penis as it throbbed, and soon he was able to hold his climax as deep as it could be reached.</p> <p>He was now looking at his penis, fully enlarged – it was almost fully erected and the veins were all up and down. He moved his hand from his member, and it felt like nothing he had ever felt. He started rubbing all his body all over, his head, his body, all over his face, his torso, his arms, his feet, his legs, his neck, and everywhere his finger made it.</p> <p>And it was the first time David had touched his penis in a sexual manner. As his friend asked him, he wanted to make love with a man, and he felt that was only his second and third time, but the first time he thought he'd never want to do it in the first place.</p> <p>He thought it was possible to make love in the way that his body was feeling, he realized that it was only the way. He felt himself shivering inside, as if he never would be able to hold back.</p> <p>He remembered that night vividly, recalling every moment of it as being like a dream. He knew he had a dream, but as well as a memory but at that he had never thought existed. He was only a fantasy. All in fact. He had some form. And a reality was real and fantasy as real.
