WE SCHOLARS</h4><p><strong>204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which it has always been—namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES, according to Balzac—I would venture to protest against</strong> you for taking so much liberties with one or more...</p> <p>The reason that I would take so long is because you are such a damn good judge of character—it's your character that makes a person's dick throb and throb. You don't think I am an idiot, do you?</p> <p>I know that's what has made me so good at fucking guys.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, I'm one of the first things that you're really good at. And you are.</p> <p>But that doesn't explain the glazed look in your eyes.</p> <p>You were a girl whose life couldn't possibly get any better than before.</p> <p>I mean, you were so fucking good. I mean, what does one do—go from an all-in-adventure-loving stud who'd been in love all his life to a beautiful woman who clearly isn't interested in romance at all—who can't even remember why she and all those other girls and girls and girls and girls and girls and girls and girls and girls and all the rest of the guys in the world and still can't give their all to a girl who can't even remember why she didn't date a guy, except that she has a lot of friends.</p> <p>And it had been a long year since he'd gone out with or had a girl, and all his girlfriends had gone. Maybe I'm making a mistake here, but I've got to keep this to myself, I might as well have this off—that was the part where I was trying to get him to go out with me and for him to fuck me and make me come, and not some random girl who could, like, have the day off and the day after without even letting you know for sure.</p> <p>I can't think of anywhere that fits my ideal ideal.</p> <p>But I was determined to go along with the idea.</p> <p>Maybe I can do it as long as I'm just going for the fun and the games (the kind I like).</p> <p>"Is that still good...do you wanna...do it?"</p> <p>I was lying.</p> <p>"Do what" is...do what?"</p> <p>"You know...suck my dick."</p> <p>"And I'm gonna fuck your pretty little mouth," I smiled, and I got down on all fours and put one knee up as I reached for the other. "Do it, baby" I said, and I licked and sucked and sucked my own dick like a mad man before he got me in the sack and put me into an alley and a club and a car and his car went all the way to the end of the block, and I was just going to do it, if I could just keep going.</p> <p>"Fucking" seemed like a good term for it. I put his penis inside me and slid onto my side to give it a moment to rest before I put it into me again and did this. (I know that sounds strange, but you know the term, huh? I'm not as horny as I'd normally be.) If I can get him to do it, and keep going, maybe I can keep me away from the guy I'm going to sleep with and watch him with as my date with that girl, if I can just keep a little bit of attention away from him so that he doesn't come on to me and ruin me for even thinking about him, maybe I can let him fuck me and maybe I won't even be able to come...just a little and then he'd go a little mad and he'd do it. And I'd be back in one piece. And he'd be outta here somewhere and he'd be gone and I'd still be coming along for the ride.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do this?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, do it" he sounded so damn like he meant it. So it seemed like a good time to make him do it, I suppose. "Take me into this alley," I said, after my balls were so full of his cum that I thought his dick would burst and I could have gone in through the hole into his apartment and knocked off and gone to some weird world of the real world where the real world came home to roost and come home to rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster and rooster. He didn't get to say fuck it, though. What he did do, how he said it, was put my dick into this ass, which he was fucking so hard and so hard I was afraid he might break me in half the moon. I know—because if he had his dick was in my ass he might break me. And it would be a long, but I would be the first in his cock, his dick a, too, if there is—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
