And after</strong> the journey they were on, the morning was not over.</p> <p>The first thing Ryan thought of after taking a shower was how he could make a nice breakfast of sautéed butter and butter melt in his mouth to eat. And they sat down to a wonderful meal of pancakes and waffles to sip on a brandy soda, to make him feel happy in some way. With that first breakfast, he was ready to spend some of his free time.</p> <p>He went to hang around the Library for a while, just a nice short walk around the city and walking to the local Mall to browse. Then he went to the park where he had discovered something fascinating before, found a movie, and enjoyed his meal. After that, he went off to read some novels before getting his book bags and checking out the Mall.</p> <p>He made it back home to the Library relatively late, and had a couple of hours of TV on, before the evening of the movie came to a close. After settling down, he began to drift through a dark and sensuous dream with his hands wrapped around his cock. Slowly stroking his cock slowly, he closed his eyes as he imagined what it would feel like to have that cock inside of him.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Ryan woke from a hot dream and the smell of frying bacon. The smell of frying bacon was intoxicating and he smiled as he looked at the clock and saw it was after 6:00AM. Then he wondered what he would be having instead of breakfast.</p> <p>"Honey! It isn't just me who woke you up!" he said out loud to his still sleeping bride, but just so the world wouldn't know who had awakened him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she responded. "I didn't mean to call, I just, I just have no idea what time it is," she said, then added, "I want to get to a new school first!" she added.</p> <p>His eyes twinkled at the thought. When he woke up that morning with the day's schedule ahead, he had no idea what he had gotten himself into. But seeing as this morning was his day off, he wasn't in any danger of being sick. He smiled as he imagined how he would feel lying next to her and taking turns stroking his cock.</p> <p>"No, wait," she said turning out the bedside light and turning on the lamp on the nightstand. Then she turned on the lamp and turned off the lamp on the nightstand, then turned down the lights a little bit in the corner of the room.</p> <p>Ryan couldn't take his eyes off of his wife's naked body and how beautiful she looked in the glow from the light of the full nightlight from the window on the bedside table. He smiled a little because he would love nothing better than to have some fun, not just jerking off to his dream of seeing his wife naked and sexy, but also just to have some fun doing it that is in the future.</p> <p>"So why don't you get up and go get dressed," she said. Then she turned off the light of the lamp on the side of the bedside table.</p> <p>Just as he got off the bed and picked up his boxers, she did the same as she had done in the dream, then she turned off the lights of the lamp and walked back over to the window.</p> <p>"There you go! I was just thinking," she said as she got up onto her elbows and knees. "I want to get dressed." Then she slipped her arm around his neck just like he saw her do, pulling him toward her.</p> <p>She wrapped her arm around his back and then reached her hand around his cock to give his ass a little squeeze. Then she slid down on the bed on her back facing him. She smiled at him.</p> <p>"Ready for the movie?" she asked as she slid down a little farther. Ryan didn't argue.</p> <p>"I'm a little bit tired of going to the movies," he said as he got on his knees and got between her legs. "I'm going to get the movie," he said as he positioned his cock just below her crotch, ready to enter her.</p> <p>"No! No. I don't want the movie. Let's go back to sleep," she said.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll give you the movie. But I'm not coming," he said.</p> <p>Then after taking the movie out of the box, he walked through the darkness back to the bedroom. He got on the bed side of her, got between her legs while he could lie on his knees between her legs. His cock and got to stand up closer to her and she held his legs as his face, and leaned up in a little kiss her. He kissed her and held her long kisses on the lips. He held his lips and started to the lips and went to share a long and moved his—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
