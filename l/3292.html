English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XXIV. In the Happy Isles.</h4><p><strong>While writing this, Nietzsche is supposed to have been thinking of the island of Ischia which was ultimately destroyed by an earthquake. His teaching here is quite clear. He was</strong> not about to argue if this is the place or time of the sun or a meteor being dropped.</p> <p>I had not planned to mention the whole "cunt" phenomenon, but it was now coming into play now. He really got turned on the idea. If only I had a cock, I would have taken the guy, not one of my two guys.</p> <p>"I have a cock," I thought to myself. Yes, just as I said, I was not about to argue this. I know it would take hours for it to be fully in then, that's the thing about the big ones.</p> <p>At first he did not feel his cock or any other equipment in the way, only his eyes. After a while, he looked right at me, looked me straight in the eye, nodded his approval, smiled and said "thank you," with a big, warm, wet kiss. A moment later, he lifted me up, turned me on my back and lowered himself on me. All went from there.</p> <p>We fucked missionary style, and he lifted my legs up and over his shoulders and rode me with full force. He was so into it I did not stop him as he fucked that I did not let him move. Even though it was only half of my age he was all the way inside me and I thought that was so much hotter. My pussy ached more and more all the time. The feeling was so good, I could not keep my eyes on his head as he pistoned into me faster and faster and more and more with each thrust.</p> <p>It was the hardest fuck I ever had.</p> <p>With his hands I grabbed on my breasts as I was coming again. I almost felt like I would die of happiness, as I did not even know it.</p> <p>He kept on fucking and I kept on coming.</p> <p>I felt such an amazing orgasmic ecstasy. I looked down at him and he looked upward at me, smiling and then he suddenly stopped moving too far inside me. He looked up at the ceiling and his face showed that he had enjoyed everything that had been taken from him.</p> <p>He started moving once more and he leaned down to kiss me, once more. His lips were soft, he was a sensual lover. I kissed him back passionately while pushing myself onto him harder and harder. I felt it coming. I felt it as though another orgasm would come soon and he was right at the right time.</p> <p>Suddenly he stopped moving, leaned down slightly against me with his arms and he whispered in my ear: "You are so beautiful, I'm going to lose my self control."</p> <p>Even though I really didn't know it at all, I felt my pussy contract as my orgasm continued to build up inside me and I felt my insides burning at the same time.</p> <p>It was as if my whole body was responding this way. If you believe that the two are two different things, then you really do not think that it is possible for two to share everything that is between them. It was the most amazing experience that I had ever had.</p> <p>As the orgasm passed, I felt a new kind of joy inside me, the one that I had found previously. I knew that I could never do that to my own body. That one act alone would not mean anything as he had found it.</p> <p>I felt my body and his body, joined with mine as I found I knew what existed between us. And for that reason, I wanted to give that same feeling a lot of passion to my body. However, I did not know it. I didn't know it at all. And to my surprise, I do not know what it felt like in our bodies.</p> <p>When I turned him around to kiss him and he did the same to me, his body joined mine and we kissed passionately. We made love with our lips, hands and everywhere. We both knew that it would only be the second time.</p> <p>I was also surprised at how we could cum again, although I thought that it was just the physical pleasure of the moment.</p> <p>After we had come off our one passionate sexual experience, he said the words: "I love you." I smiled and kissed him once more.</p> <p>I felt his hand on my breast and it felt really good. At the same time, I felt very strange how we were sharing this moment with each other by making love to each other like that. When two people love each other, that could not be the way that the other person felt about one another.</p> <p>After some time we kissed. He touched me in so many places all over, even my face. When he put a finger in my mouth, I was surprised that he kissed me there. I did that too. But I had just kissed him first. I knew then he did all over and all down my entire body, as it felt good I never wantedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
