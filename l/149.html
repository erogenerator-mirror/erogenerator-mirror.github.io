Triumph</h4><p><strong>The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various</strong> juried Courts, while they celebrated their achievement in the form of two more Supreme Court victories -- awarded to the Supreme Court in the Sixth, Second, and Third Wars, (with the exception of a Supreme CourtJustice of the Sixth Supreme Court), with the Supreme Court Supreme Court Supreme Court, Justice of the Night, as well as Chief Justice, Supreme Justice, Supreme Justice, Supreme Justice, Supreme Justice, and Supreme Justice Day, from the Supreme Supreme Court to justice.</p> <p>They celebrated their triumph today, as they stood on the stage, and held hands as they sang Happy Birthday to the Supreme Court!</p> <p>The End!!!</p> <p>Thank you for reading my stories and republishing my author Daringgeon. It is my belief that all writers at Literotica have the right to be what they are, and shouldn't be afraid to keep in the right mindset.</p> <p>This story includes elements of BDSM, Incest, Incest, D/s, Lesbianism, Lesbianism, Incest, Incest, Incest, Incest, Incest, Incest, and many others, but does not contain any of those. It is purely a fictional story. Any resemblance to persons, places, or things, living or dead, is purely coincidental.</p> <p>This story may not be shown or reproduced in any form for profit without the written consent of the writer.</p> <p>Note: If you like it, you would like the following chapter. If not, go elsewhere. If you don't like it, go elsewhere. The author doesn't condone cruel humor in such acts.</p> <p>*</p> <p>The man who had once been a father to a baby was now a father to the most incredible woman that he had ever known. Her mother who had just been pregnant with his child, was now taking care of him, serving him, and keeping him happy, even when the baby showed a sign of suffering. It was a miracle, the miracle of the world, that he was still alive.</p> <p>Nadia had just turned twenty. She was pregnant with a son, and her husband, George. Now, forty-years-old, Nadia and George attended the UMass-Boston YMCA, and they were both accepted into the world of sports. Nadia had been living up to her name, since she first met her late husband, George. George, for obvious reasons, was the captain of the Boston Cyclones baseball team when they were in school, and Nadia was now his favorite student in the team.</p> <p>Nadia had been the captain of the Boston Cyclones wrestling team from the year George transferred to Boston from Boston with an athletic scholarship, but Nadia had been able to secure an invitation to compete with her. The team was the only school in the state that had a major athletic facility near Boston, so they'd been assigned the Boston Baseball Club on the first Monday of each month.</p> <p>George and Nadia had won their matches after some very unfortunate matches. George made Nadia lose her bra and panties and put a penis gag in her mouth, making Nadia gag repeatedly, to force George to cum in her mouth.</p> <p>Nadia was a virgin. She had never made a decision, since she knew that George had given her the choice of sucking his penis, or having him shoot his load. She would have loved to have been able to get her husband George's semen all over her.</p> <p>Nadia had no regrets about sucking her husband's cock. Her experience sucking him had made her realize her sexuality as a woman, and that she had a sexual attraction to men. It was not that she found men attractive. She liked sex, especially for men who were good at it (George was), and she liked a lot of other men.</p> <p>George was not a good fuck. He was always fucking her pussy. She found it extremely pleasant to experience his hard cock thrusting into her body. He liked to make her cum on his cock, making her cum until she was practically unconscious. And she loved it to be able to swallow his cum. Some boys found this very exciting while he was fucking her. That wasn't true of her. For once, she'd been with a woman before, but not a man before.</p> <p>Nadia hated herself when she sucked her husband. She hated it when men thought that she was nothing special. She hated even more when her husband knew, by making her suck him, that he wanted to be fucking her. Her husband didn't even let her suck his cock anymore. She used his cock for her job to help in her divorce. And she wasn't allowed to even touch her tits, with those big, ugly fake silicone tits.</p> <p>Nadia never sucked on George's cock, unless he was in agreement before, and she could make him cum in her mouth. She did that.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Nadia hated herself for sucking George</p> <p>George as she</p> <p>the rest of Georgeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
