That which doth not hurt the city itself; cannot hurt any citizen.</h4><p><strong>This rule thou must remember to apply and make use of upon every conceit and apprehension of wrong. If the whole city be not hurt by this, neither am I</strong>.</p> <p>I know that is an old thing, but how can it be said about a man's need to satisfy his own needs? It will surely serve you no end in the long run.</p> <p>In that day a man did everything possible and wanted to be pleased. He knew what was best. He understood what he was doing to another. He knew that a man was the most desired of all. If you are willing to learn and learn to enjoy and be pleased in a way you do not understand, then just enjoy yourself whenever and wherever you can.</p> <p>Forgive me the errors people. Have some fun, and learn from our mistakes.</p> <p>Your man,</p> <p>Your wife</p> <p></p> <p>He kissed her hand when it closed around his cock as the rest of his body rested between hers. She loved being touched by his hand and felt a certain exhilaration as he gently began pushing against his cock. His body was still hot so there was no need to rub it but she did not feel the need to feel it anyway. She let her own passion take over her entire consciousness and as his cock began to throb a burst of pleasure raced through her body. "Oh yes! Oh yes!" she moaned.</p> <p>Her hands moved to his ass and she pulled him against her and he responded with his hips. His cock hardened as well and it seemed like it was going in another universe as it twitched.</p> <p>They broke the kiss and he leaned over and pushed back on his heels. He kissed her belly button and moved his kisses down to her thighs and she helped him as he pulled them apart and her pussy opened to the air. She grabbed the shaft of his cock with her hand and pulled him toward her pussy. He moved forward and pushed his cock inside her for the first time. He was not as thick as a real man but he was thick as the biggest cucumber. His cock felt large for her.</p> <p>He fucked her slowly and looked at her face as his large cock slid in and out of her pussy. "You're beautiful Sarah. You're so beautiful," he whispered softly into her neck.</p> <p>Their lips met and their tongues danced each other's in the space of a heartbeat. Suddenly, they were one. His large cock thrusting into her body and her hips rose and fell as him moving inside her gave the greatest pleasure possible and she was the most beautiful woman he knew. He had to stop before he came.</p> <p>"I've never done this before. Please, oh please stop. Oh yes, I want it to be you, it really is so beautiful. Yes," she moaned as if saying "I love you so much."</p> <p>After the moment, she rolled over onto her back and he continued his fucking. He moved slowly and deliberately enjoying the feeling of his cock deep in her. He would move his cock all the way out and then push it all the way back in as a tease that made her want more. With every thrust of his hips, he would slide his cock against her clit and her pussy got hotter and hotter. He kept himself slow so that the feeling would last and she was able to relax.</p> <p>"Oh God Sarah I love how it feels. It feels so good, don't ever stop it," he said and then he reached between her legs and put his finger inside her pussy.</p> <p>He used his finger to help her relax and felt her clit pressing into his finger. She moaned as his finger touched her. "I don't know how it feels," she said after he stopped moving inside of her. She wrapped her legs around his waist as her legs tightened around him and her pussy clamped his cock in tight.</p> <p>He moved his finger to her asshole and put pressure on it. "Oh, that feels good." He put another finger inside of her and she moaned. "I've never done it like that before but it feels good. It feels really good," her words seemed to come out in a rush.</p> <p>"I'm yours," he told her and moved his fingers from inside of her pussy. Suddenly, he moved his hips back and forth. His cock seemed too large to penetrate her but he felt that it would be better if he did and moved in and out of her until there was no need for more.</p> <p>"Oh yes, oh that is so good." She pulled him forward. "Oh yes," she moaned again as she took in all of him and felt what a good cock it was and wrapped her lips around it in her mouth. "Yes, oh god yes!" His hand held her hip as he fucked her face. Her head moved in time with his cock fucking her mouth.</p> <p>He put his hand over hers on her clit and held it. He had no desire to hold it. His hand just needed to hold her. Then he moved her so she wanted to move her hips.
