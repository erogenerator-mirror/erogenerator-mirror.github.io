Going Aboard.</h4><p><strong>It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew nigh the wharf. “There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I</strong>ane. We were just behind the ship and were walking slowly, not looking forward to the trip to the docks or anything else. As Iane began to pick up an English novel, we both smiled as Iane began to read the words. “The sailor”,” Iane explained, “is just a little of a sailor. I don’t even know who he is. If I were him, I would be happy to share my own story and I would love to be the sailor that lives in the English town. How, are you not happy to see me?”</p> <p>“You know, if you get a chance, I’ll do something to you in celebration,” Iane suggested before turning the page of the book. The water was cool and refreshing. We stepped out of the yacht and stepped into the harbor. Iane pulled the blankets off the bed and folded them as I undressed for bed. In the darkness of the night ahead, I could hear soft music and the sound of soft music and Iane’s body language excited me as much as I wanted to be there. Ine began to undress herself. First her hair then her left leg, then her right leg, leaving the last portion of her body free to be seen. For her right leg, she removed a bandole to reveal a tattoo of an engorged nipple, a silver nub that was pierced with a silver dollar. With her left thigh revealed, Iane parted her smooth, long, and tanned legs and I admired her smooth shaved mound.</p> <p>“You have a lovely pussy,” Ine said.</p> <p>“Thanks. I didn’t know you liked shaved pussy.”</p> <p>“We like to keep our pubes shaved clean and fresh in hopes to meet one of your clients.”</p> <p>“Does my pussy smell good?”</p> <p>“It smells good. It tastes good and my cock is hard. I’m ready to fuck. When I kiss your pussy to wake you up, I’ll taste it.”</p> <p>Iane’s eyes closed as she enjoyed the scent of my pussy, then she opened her eyes, turned towards Iane, looked me in the eye, kissed her deeply, tongue sliding between my lips. Ine’s hands were on her breasts as I stripped off my nightgown. She was naked and so was Iane. Ine had her lips covered with my tongue. Ine was licking my left breast with her lips, her hands cupping and fondling my right breast. She cupped my naked ass with her right hand as I slid a lubricated finger into her well-lubricated vagina, her hips pushed up to meet my finger. Then I began to finger fuck her, her eyes opening as I began to kiss her again. Our lips brushed as Ine moaned her pleasure.</p> <p>Her tongue had joined my finger in her mouth as I removed it from her and put it to Iane’s lips. I moved in, licked my finger clean and licked my lips. Ine looked deeply into my hazel eyes as my tongue darted in and out of her mouth. Ine’s hands were on my bum as our kiss continued, our tongues danced a mating dance and I tasted her saliva. She pushed her bottom back at Iane with her hips. Ine lifted herself slightly, then lowered and kissed Iane’s pussy again. Her eyes closed and her mouth opened and I felt her tongue on my clit. I moved one of her hands to her pussy and began to play with it. I made love to her clit, sucking it into my mouth as I kissed and licked her pussy lips, taking the hood between my lips and biting it, feeling her pussy quiver.</p> <p>“Aaahhh..” Iane’s voice had become husky with pleasure. Ine raised her bottom up as Ine returned to her pussy. Her hips bucked against Ine’s mouth as she brought her mouth, lips, and tongue to a crescendo with her orgasm. “I Love you,” Ine whispered between kisses with kisses. “Now that I have fucked the sailor’s cock, I’m not sure I want you anymore.”</p> <p>“I’m sure I’ll be the sailor’s sailor”, Ine answered with a smile as she laid herself back and Ine’s wet lips kissed my forehead as her finger was still at Iain’s pussy, “I was the sailor”,”.</p> <p></p> <p>My face to Iane’d slid her fingers into mine. “I saw she”. “ I had a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
