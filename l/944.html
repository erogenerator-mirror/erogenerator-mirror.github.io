Dress as appropriate for this occasion” 2. Remove your panties 3. Complete your hair 4. Make yourself comfortable in the office 5.” “This will be an incredible day with us,” she stated as she pulled off her shoes, revealing a beautiful body that was already covered with make-up. She grabbed her purse from the counter and walked out, holding a glass of iced tea with a white wine in her hand. She glanced down at herself, admiring how her lips and dress perfectly matched the way that her dress had turned to a sexy, lustreful look in their sexy state, her hair still wet and curled. He wanted to take her upstairs and fuck her, but in his experience a good pussy and nice lingerie like that usually takes all summer, that made for an interesting weekend. She smiled at her body in the mirror before taking the glass from her hands and putting it down on her desk to dry. She was hoping he would come by before long and start making her feel special so that they just weren’t boring old folks. But he never had been quite that close to her, and she wanted to experience this weekend the way that he had.</p> <p>She put her hands in her purse. This time, she pulled out a small purse. She slid her hands inside the inside of the purse and out into one of the drawers, quickly finding a small silver box in the back and opening it. It was a heart-shaped diamond necklace. She put the necklace around her neck. The ring glittered in the light, with a beautiful silver pendant. She placed the necklace around her neck, tightening it before placing her lips on the pendant, swirling around the ring with her tongue until it reached the bottom.</p> <p>The glass of sparkling water appeared on her desk. She drank most of it in one smooth swallow, smiling at her reflection. She looked beautiful. She looked great.</p> <p>The hotel had chosen a lovely location that it only had one person in the room, a gorgeous Italian woman who was visiting her husband in Venice from their honeymoon. The lady was beautiful, and had long, long hair with a perfect, thick tail. She was wearing a skirt and a low-cut silk blouse that revealed the cleft of her breasts, with a low-cut top that showed every bit of her lovely, full curves.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said quietly as she slipped into her chair. "I will be right back." She went past the door and walked down the hall. She stopped at the bathroom and turned down the warm water.</p> <p>She removed her shoes, but she made sure to leave her heels on. She had to get these shoes on first.</p> <p>She went back through the lobby. She stepped into the elevator with her heels off and took off the skirt and blouse, taking a seat in the very small bedroom that had no windows except for a thin white curtain. She closed the curtains around the bed to keep out the night, and turned on the stereo, taking a few moments before getting up. She removed her skirt and blouse, dropping them on the floor by the door into the bathroom and turning off the main lights before removing the shoes and her outfit. She admired herself as she removed her high heels, turning down the lights to reveal an image of beautiful lingerie and matching bra. She put the bra on, holding it while she looked through her clothes to see its reflection on her own breasts.</p> <p>She removed the bra and let it stay on, feeling it clink against her skin as she took in her soft, smooth skin, the light hairless underarms, and the slightly swollen labia on her left labia, looking over the labia herself to admire it as it disappeared inside her pussy. Her breasts were larger in appearance, and they were very beautiful, and looked very full, but looked better in her hands than in her hair, so that she could show them off to his friend, as well. She liked the way that they looked, and the thought of showing them off, so that they seemed to attract attention, not just a friend of hers, and maybe a stranger should do the same. The thought of turning around and looking at them and letting the guys see her, to look at each other, and see a stranger, while she looked at herself, making herself more vulnerable to her sexuality than ever before. The thought of him seeing her like this brought up a little image she’d of herself being alone in the world. How could do the woman, being alone and exposed and sexy. She looked at the way that she could become the way that she wished she looked. As for so that one of things are good for a good and how it would not to be, so.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>he could see.
