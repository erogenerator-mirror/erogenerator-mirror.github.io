It was already the beginning</strong> of May. As he walked outside of the house, he could see the rain starting to fall. He thought for sure that it would rain just so he could put up walls and curtains.</p> <p>In the meantime, Prince Andrew knew that his cock was hard. He had to take care of himself. This morning was a little different but all his troubles were worth it. He could only hope that her pussy would be stretched just enough to provide his cock with that same, well-anticipated pleasure.</p> <p>To make sure that she was satisfied after it stretched completely for the first time, he put all the supplies he had in his closet into his dresser and sat on the bed, where it became the easy chair he used to masturbate every now and then. He closed his eyes and imagined that she was riding his cock and taking him over and over again in her pussy. Oh my yes. Fuck yes. Fuck yes. Yes, fuck yes. Oh my God, please fuck me. Make me cum, I need it so bad. Make me cum. Oh God, give me some of that cock. I don't care if you cum now, or not, just let me sit back and watch this amazing man fuck my body. He could hardly believe it. He hoped that there would be anything left afterwards but, still, he had to get to know her.</p> <p>As instructed, he was still wearing his clothes. As he turned on his phone, he was delighted to see that an email was waiting for him. It was a series of links from one hotel to another. "Oh yeah," he signed. "Fuck yea." Prince Andrew then typed some sexy little words like "I wish," and "I wish," in the middle of his sentences.</p> <p>At the same time, Prince Andrew sat back and looked at all the sexy little thoughts on his email. If he thought about her, then she probably thought of him, and he hoped that she also thought of him. Perhaps those thoughts were all hers or all hers alone. Yes, they all wanted him. But she would certainly wonder about that later.</p> <p>A knock on the door brought Prince Andrew's heart to a halt. Yes. It was her.</p> <p>"Come in," he said.</p> <p>She entered the room and sat on the bed, her legs wide apart. She wore a loose, flirty skirt with a black thong underneath.</p> <p>"Would you like to see a little more of me?" she asked, lifting up her skirt to see and then to touch her pussy.</p> <p>"Please," he replied with a smile. He sat down again to watch this beautiful woman.</p> <p>"I don't know if you can watch me."</p> <p>"I have a laptop."</p> <p>"Okay. Go ahead."</p> <p>She took her skirt off to reveal sexy underwear and bra before returning to the bed again. She now lay on the bed next to him at the foot.</p> <p>"Would you like to see my cock again, and maybe I'd like to see you naked first," she said in an inviting way.</p> <p>Prince Andrew was not at all sure if she would do what she was asking. It was a sexy request but a sexual question that he felt unable to refuse. He began to masturbate more urgently as he watched her. He wanted her right now. He wanted to cum before she did.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she cooed as two fingers gently probed her pussy. She then bent down and took hold of his cock as she sucked him, her eyes locked on the webcam as she sucked him.</p> <p>"Fuck yes. That's it. Oh yes."</p> <p>"Please," he begged.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She then stopped sucking to let his cock fall from her mouth and looked up into his eyes lustily.</p> <p>"Please. Please put that big, hard cock inside of me," she said, not looking away from the webcam so fast as to be completely caught up in the act. "I want you in my pussy, soon."</p> <p>"I haven't asked for anything," he responded with a smile.</p> <p>"Please," she repeated. "I want you to put it in me. I hope I'm ready for it."</p> <p>Prince Andrew was really ready to put it in, but he knew that if he really did, he could not. He decided to wait. For now, he didn't dare to. "Okay," he finally agreed.</p> <p>With that, Prince Andrew slowly slid his fingers inside of her pussy, feeling and pushing his fingers so that they made contact with her clit, just the way she liked it.</p> <p>"I'm ready for you, I'm so, so happy," she encouraged his cock, now fully inside of her, as her. "please," she then thrusting it fully inside of her hard. "fuck me," she said, "fuck me, my husbandâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
