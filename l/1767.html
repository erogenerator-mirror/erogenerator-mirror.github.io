THE DANGER OF CONFIDING ONE’S SECRET TO A GOAT.</h4><p><strong>Many weeks had elapsed. The first of March had arrived. The sun, which Dubartas, that classic ancestor of periphrase, had not yet dubbed the “Grand-duke of Candles,” was none the</strong> less bright as it would be in the winter. The moon would be out before the day was up; there was no turning back now, as it was a holiday day like no other; no matter how late it would be, in case the temperatures got any colder.</p> <p>I found the little blue ball to my delight. I was in good hands at times. I had a nice little hand that held in those lovely knuckles and palms that the rest of my body would get used to. I was well trained in having an erection as it was one of my most powerful weapons – a tool that could give me anything I would ever need. The best way to do that right was to use my right hand to gently move it back and forth over the knob while holding it.</p> <p>Yes! Perfect! For now, that way, my hands would keep moving. I just wanted to look at whatever my dick could find for that very moment…not even being able to remember the last time I had. But there it was. I felt like I had some sort of signal coming now. I could only hope it was some sort of sign of some sort of desire for this beautiful gift. It wouldn't be long when I felt ready to cum. Maybe it would be just after midnight anyway.</p> <p>The door to the room opened. The night birds were out. The house was dark, except for the light that glowed to the sky out in back from the windows. As light as this house could get; this one could be a pretty good storybook. The rest of the house was dark.</p> <p>The girl at the door was standing with her back to me – looking like a young girl. The one hand in her pants that she had clasped around the shaft of my cock that was beginning to swell again as I stroked it over and over with her beautiful round ass. That cute face of hers with all those green eyes as they looked back at me with excitement.</p> <p>"I'm going to do your dick, now."</p> <p>Even though I had just begun and would be only minutes before I would cum, my entire body was a twitching mass as the young girl turned herself around and dropped to her knees in front of me. Before I could react or begin to react, her mouth wrapped around the head of my cock as my eyes stared helplessly at the ceiling.</p> <p>If she sucked that dick, what else could she do? I thought I could have cum on the spot if I had known it would do that to me. I didn't even know. She was just taking the knob and I am going to cum right here in front of her. I couldn't resist the little girl with her mouth around my shaft.</p> <p>She was going to take my load, with my cock. I was going to blow a big load, with her mouth around it. She had a mouth on her, with her lips wrapped around the shaft of my cock as I spurted over and over once again. Her cheeks were concave, so I could see that as I was ejaculating even though the room was otherwise soundless.</p> <p>I finally got my hand out from under her and she pulled it away from her mouth as if to say it never wanted to stop. Her eyes were still looking over at me as my cock stopped spewing.</p> <p>"That was beautiful, my love," she said in the strangest little voice yet. "Now you know why there is no turning back."</p> <p>She stood, pulled out her top and skirt, and I stood.</p> <p>"Come in my sweetheart," I whispered with just a hint of a smile.</p> <p>"Don't I get a kiss?" she asked, nodding toward her panties.</p> <p>"Absolutely," I could see her smile that much more as she slowly got up out of my arms, turning, and running through the house toward the window. She had closed the bedroom curtains a couple of minutes ago, but with closed curtains now, that closed door was an interesting sight.</p> <p>"Come on, dear."</p> <p>"You have one of the nicest cars I have ever drove," I observed.</p> <p>"You want a look at it?" she asked, walking back to the window.</p> <p>"Oh, I would love one," I said, hoping I wouldn't have to say it again.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't mind if you watch, do you?"</p> <p>"Oh, I am a little nervous," I said with a smile. I didn't want to sound too eager to get into the car.</p> <p>"The windows would be open if you wanted to get undressed a little," she said.</p> <p>"It would be better if I took off," I could be in it. The only, though," I was just so excited to be as not to be excited to see the view.</p> <p></p> <p>I had gone</p> <p>the way for so long</p> <p>I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
