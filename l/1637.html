"Just remember you have one month to catch up with your own parents;—"</p> <p>She took his hand and led him into her bedroom. She had a king sized brass bed. She turned on the bedside light and took the time to take off the top of her nightie. She smiled at him and put both of her hands on his shoulders and told him to lift up her teddy. Then she reached behind her and undid the buttons to her blouse. She took her hands away from his and slipped her bra and petticoat off. He looked up as she revealed her breasts. "Do you want to touch them?" she asked in a coy voice.</p> <p>He nodded eagerly.</p> <p>"And do you want to make them feel better?"</p> <p>He nodded again.</p> <p>"Would you like to kiss them and fuck them?"</p> <p>He nodded again.</p> <p>She took her hands and removed her panties. He stood, and she put her feet on the bed, giving him room to climb on top and put his arm around her waist. She rubbed her breasts against his chest as he started kissing her neck. He lowered his head to kiss her breasts. She took his hand and helped to pull her blouse off and off his shoulders and he lowered his head to kiss her nipples. He slowly put her panties down. The soft, pliable feeling of her pussy on his face and breasts was making him more sensitive to his dick. Emma felt him get harder and wetter and then her hands grabbed the back of his head and pulled him closer to her chest. Her breath became shorter in her throat as he licked her breasts, the tip of his tongue grazing her nipple and sending shivers of sexual desire all over her body.</p> <p>He pulled her closer and pulled up her nightie and put it on the bed. She saw him pulling it over his head. He had a t-shirt on that had one button, one button undone, and a button holding up the top of his shirt. She saw his body and his very obvious erection. She started getting more aggressive in what was going on between them.</p> <p>She pushed him back down on the bed and sat on the edge so she could wrap both her hands around his erection. She held him while she kissed and licked his mouth. She let him feel her breasts and his dick between her fingers while she slowly rubbed him in her hands.</p> <p>She could see him get harder and harder, feeling the tension in his eyes. Emma loved getting him even if he was so shy. She also loved hearing his eyes getting big. He was already almost bursting in his pants when she started going up and down on him, but she kept going. He was definitely going to make himself come if she took him in hand, and didn't let up when he made a sound.</p> <p>In between kisses and kisses her hands began to travel up his body and then to his dick. She had already put one hand on his head and she started stroking with the other hand. He didn't need instructions. He was moaning and thrusting forward at the pleasure Emma was giving to his erection.</p> <p>Bypassed by a bit of fear, Emma knew that she did have very little control of him for his first time. So she was happy and very content with her hand job.</p> <p>"Do you want me to stroke you?" she asked as she rubbed the head of his dick on her face.</p> <p>He nodded, he did not know what she was talking about, but he didn't care.</p> <p>Emma let her hand slid up and down his dick a few times before taking him in her mouth. She could hear him moaning and she was pleased that he was getting very vocal as she sucked his dick. She felt his hands on her head, holding it, guiding her. She didn't know if he would fuck her and then be surprised when he fucked her and then take her there.</p> <p>She stroked him while she sucked him a few times so he would know she was giving him pleasure. She was sure he wouldn't cum in her mouth. She felt his grip on her head relax as she sucked him.</p> <p>He put his hands on her, his hips jerked against the head of his dick each time she took him all the way. She felt herself getting wetter herself.</p> <p>He released her head and she heard his hand come out of her mouth. He was looking down at her and she noticed she was smiling and his dick was smiling. She sucked him, her hair was happy he was happy and in joying him as he was smiling. This was happy she was smiling in the smileing—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
