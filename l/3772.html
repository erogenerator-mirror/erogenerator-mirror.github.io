SHE FAILS.</h4><p><strong>Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken,</strong> had on her. Perhaps, that is why she had sought me out when she was in her prime. I guess she knew that it was an act, to please a powerful, influential mind, which would, at no time, be aware that it was being performed to a student. Of course, I wasn't aware of that, too busy trying to keep the dabbling girl's body hidden. Yet, I have to admit that I was becoming intrigued by the spectacle of the new lover of my life. With a capital "A", my hand reached out to the back of my teacher's legs, pushing towards the back of her thighs.</p> <p>Nancy looked as if she were having difficulty getting into the position. She was still in the throes of unconscious seduction. The pleasure building between her legs was palpable. She had stopped moving and remained there. I could see her pussy lips stretched to their limits. With the effort she made, though, they were still hidden as far as they could go. The girl had stopped moving. The girl had begun to rotate around and turn around. Her cunt was wetter than it had become a few hours ago. I could see that the girl's pussy was swollen and moist.</p> <p>I tried to move forward when, at the same time, I could not help myself from reaching out with my other hand. With no idea of whether she was aware of what I was doing, my fingers reached out for the girl's pussy lips. With one hand, I began to touch her. She was very wet, and very receptive. I was a good student, but I knew that it was much more than that. The girl had no doubt of what was about to happen. It was as if her body had betrayed her. I pushed my fingers into the girl's vagina. She gasped.</p> <p>The teacher was incredibly receptive -- even as it was being done. It had been a long time since a cock like mine had been inside such a willing woman. She'd had a little practice already, and already seemed as eager to give it her body as she was to serve mine, but only just now.</p> <p>There was an initial resistance. I withdrew my hand, and my fingers returned to the vagina, where I kept them, but instead of sliding them inside, I pulled them out. She had no objection. Then, she looked at me, and made an affirmative noise.</p> <p>Without another word, I moved forward and began to insert my fingers in her cunt. She was very active herself, and I found the idea of her sucking my fingers, as she had on the last occasion, to be as arousing as it had been. It was something to be sure that she was aware that someone had done something inside her cunt. The girl's cunt was more moist than I realized, and my fingers had found her clitoris. Not wanting to disappoint her, I began to caress the little knob, but the girl said no. With my fingers sliding inside, I could feel the passage where her vagina was making its entrance.</p> <p>"Mmm hnhm..." was all I heard as I pushed my finger in further into her body.</p> <p>"Yesss..." the girl approved, "That's good..."</p> <p>"You do it..." I encouraged her.</p> <p>She wanted me to have it right, to do this, to make the most of the situation. "I want you to... to have it..." she said.</p> <p>The girl responded with a gasp. Her body had betrayed her. Her body was a natural state. I did it for her. I wanted her to surrender herself to me completely. It was as if, at the same time, she had betrayed herself once again.</p> <p>The girl looked up at me. "It feels good, doesn't it."</p> <p>"It has always felt good," I answered, taking a finger of her left hand, "but never ... never got the chance. Never felt anything like it when I tried first to ... to ... try some of your stuff."</p> <p>"How would you try it?" the girl asked. "I mean, you know."</p> <p>"Well..." I took a little risk. With my finger, I put two fingers in the woman's mouth, and she started to swallow my finger like a dog. Her face was getting very red, but she still looked up at me, as if asking for permission.</p> <p>"You do it, don't you?", the girl said, just to get a rise out of me.</p> <p>"Oh..." I answered, "Sometimes it hurts a little. Sometimes... sometimes..."</p> <p>"Let me give you an orgasm. Let me make you cum."</p> <p>"Let me give you an orgasm. That's nice," the girl was thinking about it like that," the girl said. "But if I still want me to give you to." at your penis that she gave the penis.
