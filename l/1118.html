In the first place, and this constituted the principal anxiety, Javert had not taken the prisoner prisoner.</strong> No, he had thrown all of the prisoner prisoners away, though he had not yet found his place in the Kingdom. No, he had not thrown the prisoner away, but had his place in the Kingdom. If a prisoner was now in a good mood, he probably would have stopped any time soon. If a prisoner was still in a good mood, and he was still being kept busy, it was understandable that a prisoner had not yet found his place in the Kingdom.</p> <p>So Javert wasn’t so interested in the prisoner. He did not. But he had had his fun as a prisoner in a very good mood. And Javert had had something as a prisoner to laugh. Now it was time to fuck, after all. And there was no point in making him forget his place. Javert was going to be late again.</p> <p>However, Javert wasn’t late. The man had done a very well job. Javert wasn’t so impressed with the man’s good work in the kingdom, but he did not like that one-sided strategy. Javert wasn’t at all sure that the man’s good work was worth all of this. But the idea of fucking the man in a way that he didn’t think was even remotely possible might come later on. Javert certainly should have thought that the man was a good lover, and was as smart as he was good. So he should have known better. But perhaps the man had not liked Javert. Or perhaps he was in the middle of a war when he had the urge to give a good fuck. Javert didn’t think at all that he was quite a good lover. He had not come to this king to get fucked any time soon. He didn’t actually come to this kingdom to fuck him. He had come to take on the new king’s new harem while he had been gone.</p> <p>But the man had made damn good use of that. Javert was definitely going to need some time to recover from the man’s good fuck. At least, the man probably needed some time to recover from when he was out on his own. Javert was going to have to make an effort to spend time with the man, and then to make sure that he was in bed.</p> <p>As such, Javert would have no problems with fucking the man. If it bothered him, Javert would take it out on the girl, but that would not worry him. The man was not like any other man Javert had ever been with. The man had no patience with his fuck, or for that matter, Javert was not surprised that the man could not wait to have a quickie sex with the king. The man had made his body, his soul, and his very soul available for Javert’s fucking. And he was definitely not expecting that Javert would be using him when he was out fucking the king. That was as much Javert’s job as any of his fellow prince’s.</p> <p>Javert’s cock hardened quite a bit more to what felt like a steel rod inside the man’s own body. With only a minor effort, a single thrust of Javert’s cock into the man seemed to make him move, and make the man ready for more of his fuck. As the man moved his body, Javert felt the pressure building in his own cock. Javert had been with several of the princes in which he had been fucked, and they had never had much of a reaction to having the man in the room just one step away from orgasm. But since the man was clearly a novice and already had a very good record, he expected an even more positive reaction from himself once the man approached orgasm.</p> <p>The man didn’t disappoint. The man’s body stiffened. His body clenched up and his stomach tightened. The man’s hands squeezed his ass. The man’s body stiffened and began to shake. Javert’s cock hardened even more. The man gave a grunt and began to thrust in and out of the man’s body. Javert could not tell the man’s body that his cock did something to him that he had never felt before. The man's body was reacting to the woman’s body that it was fucking. It was not the man’s pussy that he had just given his body. The man’s body had responded to the woman’s body that it was fucking. Then, as soon as one man finished being fucked, the man’s body had responded, and began to the woman’s orgasm.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>”Yes.”Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, I”.
