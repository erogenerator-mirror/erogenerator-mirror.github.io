Enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution;</strong> a time gone by, in which the memory of the people, of all that went before to remember and savour their memories and the mistakes of their times and their future took root.</p> <p>It was time to do good. The moment of our first act was upon us. To do what? To have sex? No fucking, no love. And fuck as we would ever really love that?</p> <p>The moment had come. The act. The act. The act. The acts. The acts. The acts, and what did they do to our minds that made me even more afraid of the inevitable ending? What did they do to all mankind?</p> <p>With all their faults and faults, with all their failings and faults, our sex drive was at once too strong, too strong, too strong, to survive. To me that was not the same. Sex was too dangerous, too dangerous, and too much fun. We could not last forever. There could be no end to the pleasure of the sex-life. To have a man die out and then leave his life with a woman, no matter what the consequences of our actions or the consequences of his ways, was too much to contemplate, too much to resist. Our sex life could continue forever, in the future, in the future, and in the future, forever, if we could avoid the ending.</p> <p>We had to do what? Oh yes. The last act, and of course, the last act to be done, was only a second act and should never be repeated. But we needed to do it. We needed to do it, with him, with no consequences.</p> <p>The only way to actually have sex was by being in the moment. The first act has only to be done. And when the action is done, you have to be in the moment.</p> <p>So we were in the moment. It seemed to all to be right, though, as you would imagine, it was only three days till the first day of the next day. That was the point of our act. The act of which we needed to perform it on the first day of the next month, when our next period of the year would start...</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>That day had come. The moment had arrived. Now, once again, we were in the moment.</p> <p>We were both going to do something together, but all this would be left to the three of us, only for the three of us to have one other moment: to be together, for as long, one thing, as long as we wanted. A special moment. The moment of the moment of the final moments of our act: the day of a new beginning and the future. One who had been the first, was the first and the last act.</p> <p>And what it would have taken before we did something like this: one moment, a special moment, a special moment, a special moment, and a special moment, with us in the midst of it all, could have been seen to be a moment of rebirth and the fulfillment of a new chapter in the lives of humanity, an indescribably new chapter in the lives of the female species.</p> <p>A moment of joining the first, the first of the new species.</p> <p>A moment of sharing memories of this new chapter in the lives of humanity, of that new day we have begun, so long, so long.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>We had not gone a day without it. It felt as though we had each taken one moment out of our lives: the beginning of the new day. I was in the moment, too.</p> <p>As we got undressed for the first time, we were both naked except for our bras and our panties, with him looking like a statue. We felt in each other's arms, like two lovers, embracing on the first moment. And as we walked along the corridor with him in the hall, I felt as though I had never been so naked before. He was naked too, but the feeling of being naked was different. More tangible, more arousing, more powerful. There was something else, some power in me. We knew we would be naked, but no one could see us: and we weren't going to change that.</p> <p>So we walked together. His arms encircled me around my waist. His lips, on my shoulders, my neck, on my breasts, kissing and sucking them. My breasts. He could squeeze them.</p> <p>"Yes. Your nipples are hard," he murmured at them, and I giggled, and he squeezed them, as I felt his hands moving along my inner thighs and thighs, from my toes to my crotch.</p> <p>my cunt. "cunny, nara," "nn", one moment</p> <p></p> <p>and and I were the other one moment. "n moment. for the other. and the other, a part—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
