A CASE OF IDENTITY</h4><p><strong>“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind</strong> can perceive.”</p> <p>“We will have to wait for the moment we fall asleep to be here again,” we both added, and we sat naked except for our robes wrapped around us.</p> <p>But we made ourselves some coffee. On second thought we'd be sleeping with some of the people we knew. And what good could it do if anyone we knew would know that it was our secret?</p> <p>I looked down on my robe, ”I suppose you already know me now, from now on, because my name’s John.”</p> <p>”I know.”</p> <p>“I've been dreaming about you for months.”</p> <p>“Mmmm, the fantasies haven’t abated since yesterday,” said John as he leaned in near by the fire and began kissing my neck.</p> <p>“I know,” I said with a moan.</p> <p>John's hands were exploring the rest of my body. He had his lips firmly around my breast as he slipped the robe off. His hands gliding over my skin as he gently fondled my breasts and kissed my nipples. “You’re so beautiful, John.” As if to answer my statement, John’s hands slipped between my thighs and cupped my pussy beneath the flowing juices. My lips parted and as his fingers began to explore the folds of my swollen womanhood, he sucked each nipple with his lips and teeth.</p> <p>He pulled my hips back against his hardness. “I can feel you, baby. Is this what you want?” my hips lifted up to meet his caresses.</p> <p>“Yes.” I was breathing heavily and my nipples were on fire.</p> <p>John quickly took off his robe and threw it to the floor. He climbed on top of me and began to slip between my legs as he was driving my pussy mad with his hard tool. We were both sweating and panting in passion. He spread my legs and inserted his fingers into my tight hole as he entered me with one long hard thrust.</p> <p>“Oh, John.” I moaned. “I want you inside me.” He leaned down and kissed me as he continued to penetrate me with his hard cock. “I can’t believe I’ve been dreaming of this for months.”</p> <p>“You just keep dreaming,” I replied, “and soon we'll have our way.”</p> <p>I held John's hand as he fucked me and he played with my breasts again. “We’ll have to tell your Dad about this,” I said. “He’ll never approve.”</p> <p>“Maybe not yet,” responded John. “I’ve been dreaming of you too.” And that’s where we ended up.</p> <p>And there I was, alone in a bedroom with my roommate John, wearing only the sheer white robe from my bedclothes. And to top it all off, John was fucking me with a long thick shaft. He was a pro at everything he wanted to do to my pussy as he slid in and out and I could feel the tension of anticipation rising in me. I could tell that John was getting close and I wanted his cock to be inside me. I whispered to him to be more gentle and so he took my hand and led me to my room. I stood in front of the bed as I watched him strip off his clothes. After a bit, he climbed aboard and plunged his hard cock deep inside me. I gasped at the size of him.</p> <p>I turned and began to kiss him as he began to fuck me. His lips were soft and tasted good. John had a nice touch to him as he sucked my bottom lip gently as he continued his assault on my body. When he sensed I was approaching climax, he continued to fuck me without abandon and, when I came all over his cock, he exploded all over me. I felt his hot cum gushing inside and it was just what I needed.</p> <p>John sat beside me on the bed exhausted. We kissed for a long time as we basked in the afterglow of our passion—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
