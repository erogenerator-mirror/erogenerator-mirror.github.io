English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXXII. The Supper.</h4><p><strong>In the first seven verses of this discourse, I cannot help seeing a gentle allusion to Schopenhauer’s habits as a bon-vivant. For a pessimist, be it remembered, Schopenhauer led quite</strong> a bit of sexual revolution around the 19th century. He was a scholar of art, and his studies produced such erotic writings as erotic and non-erotic sculpture and painting, that he himself was the object of worship at the temple. I had read all of the books, and the paintings, but I could tell that this was one of those artists of eroticism, perhaps his favorite.</p> <p>I wondered about the rest of it, and my thoughts were disturbed. I hadn’t seen any more books, or any pictures of him since I had departed the temple of the king, but I had read the history books, the one about the king's marriage, and the two books about the marriage between the king and his daughter. That he had not married their child is obvious, but the king in the last book, which read as “It should not be seen as a crime.” I wondered whether or not I should know the book of the king by now, so I could not make a guess about his habits. In any case, in short, this was definitely not the way things should be. But, as a man and, of that I might even add, a son, it would not be a surprise to me to know he had never gotten married.</p> <p>It was time for the lesson to begin. I put my left hand on Emma’s left knee, and moved it up along her inner thigh. I rubbed a gentle hand along her inner thigh as I felt her move, and soon my hand was up near her pussy, and between her legs. This time, it was not only me touching Emma’s pussy, it was a student in the art of sexual intercourse. I wanted something different about Emma, too, so I placed my hand on her other knee as well. Emma was responding to the touch, and she was also moving her hands up and down my thigh with her hand near my cock. I looked at her and saw her nipples hardening, which I knew would be visible through the thin silk robe.</p> <p>I had to take my hand off Emma’s breast, however, for it was time to begin the lesson. “You can go ahead now.” I said to Emma. She did as she was told and went in search of him. She was not surprised when I pointed at the foot of the bed. When she entered, I told her to stand there and wait. I told her to strip, but to place her robe on the hook by the headboard of the bed. When she was naked, I went behind her and held her arms. I reached between her legs and felt the wetness. Emma, who was standing there in the corner and watching me was not aware of anything except that I was holding her, and that her robe was open, showing her naked ass and dripping wet pussy.</p> <p>My hand found Emma’s pussy. I could feel the wetness, so I began to stroke her pussy with two fingers. I could feel that Emma was very wet. There was no doubt about it, of course, that there were other lovers of the woman on the bed. I wondered if the two women on the bed could be identical, if they could do each other. I knew I should not have had sex before the girls, because of the consequences of my action, but just to be the teacher, to show Emma that I could do things for her, I decided to tell her the truth, that the sex was done as one does.</p> <p>I held her hands by her wrists, and lifted them away from her body to give myself more space, and to put myself in line with her own body and make her into what she knows now, should she become my wife. I kissed her lips, and told her that I loved her. I kissed her like that for a long time, giving her all the time I could. I wanted to push my fingers inside her, to have a taste, to feel her, to feel how my cock would feel inside her mouth, to feel her as Emma wanted. She was responding to all these things, and I wondered if I could have done so, had I not come. I was almost tempted to go on about how wonderful it would be to fuck her in the way I was, but I realized that wasn’t an option. I needed to fuck her in the way I wanted. I needed to cum inside her, but wanted to do it in her mouth. I was going to take her, to fuck her and make her taste me. I was going to push myself down on her face and tongue and mouth. I knew this. She would be very much in love to know what it was like for me; what it was like to be inside a woman.</p> <p>My daughter’s mouth, I wanted to feel my cock, to make her feel warm my cum inside her. I thought, she would feel like I was going into—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
