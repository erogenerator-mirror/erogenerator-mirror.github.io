English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XLIV. THE STILLEST HOUR.</h4><p><strong>What hath happened unto me, my friends? Ye see me troubled, driven forth, unwillingly obedient, ready to go—alas, to go away from YOU! Yea, once more must Zarathustra retire to</strong> heaven, alone and unfaithful.</p> <p>It had taken me a year to come to this place and I feel at once as if I've been transported, but not, truly, as we all now go, I do hope. As you know, I have not been married to anyone's child for a year or so yet I still have a job as Zarathustra's secretary. And I find myself not only to be easy on the eyes—but so am I. With all the drama within me, I am not so easy to please. The other days of my marriage have been great. But I have lost much weight since, I suppose, as in the years. But I could no longer bring myself to say the words, the words, or even to feel the emotion when it's my own life in my hands that I feel so close to this person, so ready to spend the next few years with him, so ready to share our special bond. And now, it's time for me to do something about it. My friends, for whom I've been happily married for a long, long time, will not ever know. At last, Zarathustra will reveal how much he loves me and yet how much he loves myself. You can begin and I can begin whenever you both are ready to do so. Just be patient, you know.</p> <p>Oh, and by the way, if this helps make up for being a hopeless eunuch, you might as well skip the next session with the Professor in his class.</p> <p>Zarathustra—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
