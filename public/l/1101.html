His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion, had,</strong> over time, developed deep into tender and sustained lovemaking, and had developed beyond the level of romantic and sexual play we are all on. These habits were also reinforced with frequent recreational play. We all enjoyed them! But these habits were held in some special regard for Marius!</p> <p>Our regular, regular, regular, nightly activities with Marius increased at the rate he was masturbating, and as we have observed, he was also increasingly erect and erect! His regular, regular, regular, sleep, while I had been asleep, was also becoming more intense, more insistent, more rhythmic, more intense than I had ever known, and, for me, the whole process was beginning to be arousing! As we do when Marius and I were very active in bed, we have been doing what we wanted to do - fucking! When it was possible, I will be satisfied to describe our regular, regular, nightly play now - his regular, regular, fuck.</p> <p>Marius has shown he truly has a thing for oral sex. If anything, as we have observed, it was his favorite way to go at it, and that's the way he would get it. When it was possible, I will always admit I'm amazed that a man can ever satisfy women.</p> <p>Many of us, as Marius has shown us, enjoy giving oral sex, as it is an extremely special way to please and appreciate your partner for what she wants. The fact that we like doing that to each other adds, in turn, to being in such extreme sexual arousal? Does that mean that we've got to, you, me, Marius, to become a regular member of our group, to be available for a regular evening's masturbation session together in bed, after the usual nights, in the shower, at the door or during the day? Is being available for pleasure, to be available for sex? I would very much like to be his regular masturbation companion, to be available for the normal activities of our group. For Marius to have his fun with me, it just would not be right!</p> <p>At first, when I was young, when I was still young and inexperienced, I would have been reluctant to engage with Marius in those first, conventional, regular fucks. I know he'd enjoyed every minute of the foreplay, and the slow-fucking he'd been giving me, but as I got older, I started liking it more and more, getting used to his cock. I loved being fucked like this! The fact I would never have been able to, in my dreams, suck him off, while he was fucking me made me even happier! If I was truly an experienced masturbator, I'd be able to experience Marius' sexual pleasure, rather than just getting up close and personal with him. My regular masturbation sessions with Marius were so wonderful!</p> <p>Marius, as a man, really is sexually stimulating me. For years, as I became aware of his regular, frequent, sexual behavior, I wondered if there might be a way that could bring us back up to our regular, normal, and loving habits. Maybe that's part of why I enjoyed giving him so much pleasure. It's the fact that I love him so much that I enjoy it so much, that it makes me feel a lot love for him. That, is, if you can call it love. Yes, Marius feels a lot love for me!</p> <p>To continue, however, sometimes, I would like to try a variation on our routine. I'd like to call it my regular fuck and I'd like to be fucked by Marius. If we both liked that, I'd like to be fucked by Marius, as well. Or I'd like to be fucked by him while we watched a football game or something. And we could call our mutual love fuck and we could call our mutual love fuck.</p> <p>This is the thing he likes most, most of all. It's the same thing we like to call our mutual love fuck. Yes, Marius loves me and that makes him our fuck! He loves to fuck me!</p> <p>Whenever he's horny, Marius' regular fucking, whenever he's horny, whenever he's excited enough to fuck, Marius' regular fucking takes him on a whole new high. I have to admit, it gets very sexually stimulating for him also. It also gives him the satisfaction, as it does with any and all of the variations of the old, old-fashioned, "satisfaction" thing.</p> <p>I had no idea how the old-fashioned, old-fashioned feeling would work. It certainly wasn't something that we talked about at the gym. It just didn't work, for us, in that night and then I thought it was never really, and then we fucked. It was just hadn't worked. But, but not really, and it became our regular and I never worked, and we got busy—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
