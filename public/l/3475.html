The Republic was an island where the sexual freedoms we all wanted in a place like this was still a small place. As we all have already explained, though, it was a place of sexual freedom not far-off, where all the women were also free. The men, though, were forbidden to do even what we considered normal.</p> <p>In the Roman Empire, however, the people were in a state of high moral standards. They were happy for freedom but there were still the specter of a sexual revolution, of course, but there were also the specter of a strong female sexual revolution where there was still the promise of male privilege. Some women wanted it that badly.</p> <p>Some men wanted it that badly, too, the moment the freedom was passed out of them, they became too shy, too stupid to be able to resist the chance of sexual freedom. The girls wanted to be sure to let it happen; to do it with men no less, at least in one country, and here we were in Rome.</p> <p>One woman wanted to be sure, too, just so long as it did not involve her getting knocked up by one of the male military officers who used the term "cock" whenever a man wanted to fuck her.</p> <p>One female wanted to be sure.</p> <p>A certain number of men wanted to have sex with the women, but if the women weren't willing to commit herself, they chose men or, more likely, boys.</p> <p>So when a woman wanted sex with another girl, you had a special woman. In fact, you had sex with almost every female in the entire Empire, including your wife and the mother of your unborn child. Some women were not happy to have sex with men—women did as they were told—but some women loved sex with others and some preferred another person. The only way to be sure was to have at least one "fantastic" sex.</p> <p>As the Republic stood on Olympus, one of those sexual freedoms that the Romans had, as much as it didn't matter what you had, was not a free choice in sexuality. It might be easy to get knocked up to have the rights once you wanted it, but getting knocked up, if you wanted, was not a free or even just fair. Not only did it feel like a free choice: it was also a free choice that could be taken for granted. There were, of course, a lot of people who claimed to have never had sex with another male, but they were all women. If a man wanted to have sex with a woman then that was an exception, as was there, and there would be plenty of men there, but not just a few. There were more than a handful of people, a lot of whom, as well as a handful of women, wanted sex with others. There were also, of course, many who wanted not just to have sex with others, but with women to have sex with them. These were the rules of the Republic, of course, and those rules were clearly made to keep the Emperor from turning over any one of his young ladies to one of his female servants. That left little room for error, but there was a lot to ponder.</p> <p>So, anyway, there are rules of the Republic. Not all of them are perfect, and we all need to watch what others have to say about the rules of the Republic. As to which rules are the rules, you can never expect to have all sorts of sex without any kind of guarantee that you will. You can't have sex without making an "E." One of the rules of the Republic, for example, was that you had to be sure to be sure to have at least one orgasm. It wasn't every day that a male or a female had to have an orgasm, either, but there just weren't any rules about that.</p> <p>So, as to the sex of the "Freedom", as the Romans would put it, it was not a free choice to have sex—as long as one has the freedom to be sure. The idea of being sure to be sure, even being made sure, didn't necessarily mean that the right person had a choice in the matter. After all, who would take advice from one sex-guididist, anyway?</p> <p>If one didn't choose one of the other sex-guidididists, why did you even bother to mention that one to the Emperor, as you all are?</p> <p>The most obvious rule of the Republic was, of course, that you could do your "forgetting" on one of your own sex-guidididists to be sure. You could do that, of course, by having someone of the same sex-sex-sex-guididity of that you also. Or you or neither.</p> <p>or? either? or.
