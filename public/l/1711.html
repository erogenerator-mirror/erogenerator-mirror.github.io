Maybe then the lover could also use some of the experience from previous chapter to bring her into the world of sex. Perhaps you are going to like this story. It makes more sense if you read chapter 1. The story is the sequel. It contains sex, lesbian sex, lesbian lesbian sex, even lesbian porn. Enjoy!</p> <p>*****</p> <p>By the time we got to bed, neither of us had any clothes to remove. We were both horny as hell and had been naked plenty of times before. We made sure we had had plenty of time to rest before falling asleep. It was just after 8:30 when we woke and went into the bathroom. When we came back out, the sun was just beginning to set.</p> <p>"I'm glad we got here, we should really start early," I said, kissing her.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think that's such a good idea! I'm afraid we're going to get caught," she said, giggling as she slipped from my arms to the floor, sitting on the toilet, her legs spread wide apart. I looked down and saw that my cock was already erect by the time she sat down. Looking at me, she giggled again, spreading herself for me. The idea of what I was about to do to her had turned me on more than I thought possible. I stepped forward and gently lowered myself over her, my tip pressing against her lips. As I did, I pushed myself just a few inches in, barely making sure my tip was dry.</p> <p>A few moments later, I felt two of her hands on my ass, pushing me forward, guiding my cock into her pussy. She was so wet, almost dripping her juices onto me. The feelings emanating from her pussy, combined with the sensation of entering her was almost enough to make me come. I pushed myself further into her, until she was fully impaled. I stopped there for a few seconds to let her get used to my presence, then slowly started moving.</p> <p>"Oh my!" she said, her eyes wide in shock for a moment. "You ... you're inside? You're going to make me come!"</p> <p>I stopped with only about half of myself buried in her pussy. "I don't need to go all the way in; you're plenty wet enough, just like we were."</p> <p>We both sat there, just enjoying the feeling of my penis in her. I had never been able to come that quickly in my entire life. I had fantasized myself coming with her, and now that had been actually happening. We both groaned in pleasure at the feeling.</p> <p>I don't know how long we continued like this. I tried to keep my pace slow, but it would only end when I felt her pussy clench around me. She stopped moving, pulling with her hands and holding on to me. I pulled my head back from her breasts, sucking the nipple between my lips when she pulled me back.</p> <p>Her eyes were shut tight. "Oh ... Oh ... Oh ..."</p> <p>I felt her pussy squeeze me, trying to draw more out, drawing me out. All the feelings were incredible. I never wanted this to end. Our bodies were moving more frantically in unison, each of us screaming at the absolute ecstasy we had reached. As her body began shaking underneath me, I heard the sound of her voice, "Oh my ... Oh my ... oh my ... Oh my God ... Oh my....."</p> <p>I felt her pussy tighten around me again, making my own orgasm more intense by the second. I closed my eyes briefly as my cock began shooting jet after jet of my come inside her, the pleasure washing through me as I emptied myself into her. I felt her body start to shake with orgasm. When I heard her moaning softly, I stopped in what seemed like seconds, the entire length of my cock still inside her. She wrapped her arms around me and I held on for dear life.</p> <p>Finally, we separated slightly, our bodies still moving. "Gosh, Tim, that was so good. I needed that," she said, blushing once more.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sorry I just couldn't last any longer. You're so wet. You're soaking," I said, not being able to speak at all.</p> <p>"It's okay, I came from your lips. I'm not used to that. You're fantastic, Tim. Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Yes! Oh my god, yes," was all I could say, but it sounded almost incoherent.</p> <p>"I don't know what to do or say," she said, "I really should go to the bathroom." She slid off the bed, putting her clothes back on the floor. She bent over a chair, and stood up to her knees and turned towards me. Then she pulled me. "I'd better yet. I'm not let's get out." Again, Tim," and walkâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
