This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not</strong> wish to be alone, though if the day is perfect you never, ahh, ever have more than twenty-five minutes of my cock inside of you when you are alone. In my case, though, I shall be able to take it, as long as you are quiet—and take it very well indeed.</p> <p>I began fucking you hard—just as I always had, and you loved every minute of it, and you had always loved me for it...</p> <p>We kissed, our tongues dancing with each other's while I fucked into you—the bed-head hitting the ceiling each time I slammed into you. Then you broke off the kiss and gasped, "Hurry up! I want to be on the bed!" That was not the first time you had mentioned this to me before; it had surprised me until I saw you do it the next morning, and even before I had taken you into the shower. It was the most wonderful night of my life! I gave you my virginity in the shower, and you seemed so happy and happy; I couldn't help moaning in ecstasy just from thinking about you. I gave you your first orgasm, too, you were such a good girl. You said I made it better for you. You seemed to give me back control back. I did not need to be told what to do—you know: let go and do what pleases me. You had even told me about your parents, so that left you with no privacy or privacy-after-hours after school. I wanted you to be used so that it wouldn't be the same when we fucked. You were my dirty little slut! I told you to get a man, to let him fuck your brains out every morning. I knew it was not an easy thing for you to do. I made you feel like a slut, so that when I saw that you were having orgasms while you watched me, I would be able to make a man cum. I was very good at making you orgasm, and that was because I would make you cum all over my cock—you were a virgin now, after all.</p> <p>My cock was already hard, so I told you I would fuck you from behind. You were already sopping wet, but I pulled off the condom and put it in your mouth and kissed you, as I fucked you with the lubricious shaft of my member. It looked so good you didn't even need any. It was like the taste of the rubber didn't matter. After about five minutes of fucking you, I felt I would be coming soon. I said I was about to come so the head of my prick was at the entrance to your canal. You had already been wet enough; I slid right in, and I could feel you clamp down on me—you had already come twice— and now you wanted my come, which you felt I wanted to give you. You grabbed my balls as I fucked into you and told me you liked it that way, that you didn't have any control over such a big one that I would be coming inside you so often that you would have multiple orgasms the second day I was here. This was true, and really gave you an orgasm that you would never experience again in your life!</p> <p>I fucked you as hard and fast as I could for the rest of the night. When I looked at the clock, it was ten past nine. I told you I was ready for your last two days—I needed to get that cock of mine to come—and that I would fuck you so much you would be screaming in ecstasy when you came. You had been very busy, for one of the afternoon! As you lay next to me on that bed with your dress hiked halfway up your leg, making me wish that I had a condom, you grabbed the edge of the bed and said that I wouldn't.</p> <p>I felt so stupid doing that. I couldn't help it, so I just had to ask you what you meant. You just smiled and said, "Oh please, darling, it will make me feel better too to have you tell me to do that"</p> <p>"There's just one more thing" I said, wanting to give you at least two more orgasms before we went home. Well, since I thought you were going to want one more I told you, "I want to fuck you" and you didn't have to ask twice! You lay back with your legs open and started kissing me. Then you felt your hymen tear and you pulled me onto you, which felt so incredibly good. I said I didn't know if I could last much longer, and you told me that's why you said you wanted to be on the bed. My penis was fully hard again and I thought I would come soon, so it was no longer. You put my penis out, got off the condom, and we went to our bedroom and lay down on the bed. You undressed each other sheets.
