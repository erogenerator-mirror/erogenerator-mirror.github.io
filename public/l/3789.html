Our seats were empty and they were waiting for us in the back!</p> <p>We had arrived in the back of the transports' Command Tower that morning.</p> <p>Our transport had arrived that day.</p> <p>The transport had arrived on time today and began its journey at its next station.</p> <p>We were going to be in space, and were going to be on the very edge of space.</p> <p>The decision to travel to space would not be an issue for me. As they say in the modern age, it was what you do - a matter of perspective. I was going with the flow and nothing else.</p> <p>So we boarded our transport and headed our way.</p> <p>They were waiting for us in the back. It was a little cramped as my feet touched the bottom seat and I felt like I was about to have a fall on the seat in front of me. The seat was too cold to me. I was thankful for that. I felt that all I needed was to pull off my hat, my sunglasses, a loose scarf, and my hair.</p> <p>The driver of the transport was a large, imposing white-haired man in his mid-forties, a kind of black-shirt-top like the one that you see on the movies. He was wearing an immaculate white shirt and dark blue jeans. His hair was in a ponytail, but didn't look quite as jet-lagged as one might expect. I could see that he wore no belt, a leather belt and dark shoes.</p> <p>He glanced over at me and smiled, and I could see that he was checking me out.</p> <p>As we crossed over a threshold and entered the small, metal-clad elevator, I felt his gaze linger on me again and my eyes went wide.</p> <p>We entered a corridor similar to the one we had entered previously, and the lift began to take us out of the terminal we had passed. It had taken us several minutes to gain entrance, and I still had a minute to spare to reach the Command Tower.</p> <p>As we entered the Command Tower I looked around at the faces of the passengers. I saw those who had met us through the glass of the Tower's main doors and felt their excitement, and the excitement of meeting me. There will be no doubt of our destiny in time.</p> <p>We arrived at the Command Tower just in time to hear the announcement that had been issued by the Commanding Officer. The Commander had called a meeting of his Commanders about a month earlier and the one who had been the lead was there as well. Our Commanders had each approved the order on our behalf, the request of an individual to attend to our individual needs and the request of the Commanders themselves. We had been notified and it had been approved unanimously.</p> <p>The Commanders had agreed that we were to come back to the Command Tower within the one quarter of an hour time limit.</p> <p>I wondered how we would be able to do that without losing the Commanders' notice and losing the precious patience it held.</p> <p>I looked at the Commanders. "My guess is that we will just be the very last ones to enter the Command Tower. We will wait until our own order is issued and then just wait."</p> <p>"Of course! Of course!" the Commanders exclaimed with joy as they heard my reply.</p> <p>"However," The Commander said, "we will have to wait until we have issued our order and we will be free to enter the Command Tower without saying anything else."</p> <p>The Commanders were nodding their agreement. There would be more than a short period of time, they thought, before the Commanders would come back.</p> <p>With that suggestion in mind, it was time to make our way back to the Command Tower. It would take some time for us to reach it and I found myself wondering what the Commanders would say if we made our way back to Earth, but that fear made it impossible to say anything. We would be wasting valuable time, I thought.</p> <p>I looked across at the Commanders. "Will we be able to go to Earth without saying a word?" I asked.</p> <p>Both responded with equal enthusiasm, "Of course we will! What are we going to do?"</p> <p>I told them, "Whatever we decide to do, we can come back at our own time."</p> <p>Both agreed. I wanted to ask, but not yet. If it would keep their attention, however, we would do it.</p> <p></p> <p>We were then told our Commanders that we were going back to our own destinations in the Command Tower. They would allow us this and we will come to go with our Commanders they will see usâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
