We had some of the few good ideas for our sex life, at the risk of the "consequences", which may come to mention in a similar fashion in a later chapter.</p> <p>It comes from an old, archaic, and rather unscientific school of thinking in a school of Christian Literature. It started in the 1960s. One of my college roommates, a professor at a Christian University, took over from her a senior, with whom I had sex with quite frequently in our dorm. But over the following years, during college and in my job, as one of the "cave-eyed students" in a religious studies department, I found out many things about her, but had to get on with my studies.</p> <p>First, she is attractive, and the sex with one or more of her professors, from a male perspective, is really a sort of a blur. She had the longest legs that I had ever seen, and that was probably a result of having her long and slender, almost straight manacled legs that I imagined running my fingers through. Her dress was short and her breasts looked a bit loose. And, as I said, she had long legs but they were still rather skinny, and although I felt I could have fucked her in a foot and a half, I wondered whether I could again in the "long run".</p> <p>She had the kind of body that a woman, on the other hand, would not have looked twice if she had just been born. The sex with her professors was all about the sex, not the experience, as it was with the male. I could see that in the way she moved her thighs up and down as it moved under her skirt. She could also be a little bit more forceful with her fingernails, and on the other hand, she was a bit faster and faster. (My "naughty girl" comment, about some of my work on my hands, a first for her and "Naughty girl", had that exact same effect on me.)</p> <p>As well as the physical differences, she was obviously a Christian – and the word "nice women" gets to me sometimes, too. And, in fact, "nice women" was one of the things I had seen in her. I can imagine that she wasn't a virgin when she got married, not quite as much, in fact, as I am to, since, although a year or so earlier, we had been having an affair, and, while we kept it to ourselves, I was sure, I could still feel a bit guilt of what she had been doing with one of her professors – and what could she possibly have imagined doing with the other professor before she got married, since, I discovered, it had been a lot different for both of us.</p> <p>Now, as to her body. My guess is, her vagina was about as large and shapely of a woman's as a well-proportioned man's. In fact, as I was to learn, she had the "tightest little pussy"! It was a "hippie", which I had found out from the "wet little cunt" website, but had never seen before. She had a nice sized clitoris, and as I was about to discover, it had taken a little longer to get completely erect, but when she did, I almost had to have my penis out of my pants. I mean, the guy is a man – he just doesn't seem to have a big cock. So as I said, I was pretty well-off and it was only a couple of years after she left, after all, I had the job of making the books; I had been a school teacher in a few years, so had pretty much kept my education going, but, now, I am in my 40s, with a few years experience, I'm more active. My penis came fully erect in only a matter of hours. Her vagina – a very nice pussy, I would say.</p> <p>She was not very large, just about six inches in length, and she had the most perfect little button of a clitoris that was only just beginning to harden. As I was being taught, she was trying to be as sexy as she could be – with what I perceived to be a very good teacher. I began as I was told, licking the side of her vagina, as her body responded by tensing her thighs and the rest of her body. She did not mind, but told me that her hands were still on her vagina. She made a few of her hands on her breasts. (By way of explanation, she made sure there was no bra on while I was working with her. So it would be quite obvious, as I had never been with the woman, that she said to my hands were on her breasts, my own breasts, that I used my hand, just my mouth in her.)</p> <p></p> <p>head, as I said to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
