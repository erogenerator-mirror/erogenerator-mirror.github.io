What is this, that now my fancy is set upon? of what things doth</h4><p><strong>it consist? how long can it last? which of all the virtues is the proper virtue for this present use? as whether meekness, fortitude, truth, faith, sincerity, contentation, or any</strong> of the above is the correct answer but, at the same time, I felt that in the end it would end on the way to another climax of a woman's orgasm that I couldn't go without. Even though I had had enough, I did feel like I could still go. I could now have some more of this fun and then I'd just go along with it because I couldn't go without a woman's pussy either.</p> <p>I felt the tip of my prick pressing at the lips of my ass as my head touched the wet wet folds of my wife's pussy. She was so wet.</p> <p>"It hurts you," I told her.</p> <p>"I'm not going to be fucked like this until you're ready."</p> <p>And, yes! she was ready, she was ready for what she'd hoped in the first place. And, at the same time she had to know I was ready as long as she was willing to feel like this. I had to wait until she was ready if she wasn't, I had to tell her she had a choice though. It made no difference now.</p> <p>Her hands pressed at my cock, sliding it from inside her pussy, around to my ass and back to the wet crevice between her legs, again.</p> <p>"I think I want to suck your cock," she said. "I want to feel it in my mouth."</p> <p>I heard her voice trembling with fear as she pushed away my cock and pulled her legs up around her shoulders. I got up on the sofa and sat down near her mouth. She took the head of my prick in one hand and sucked it into her mouth with her other hand.</p> <p>I held her head and gently urged her to go on a bit further. She kept at it while my cock head made its way in and out of her mouth.</p> <p>I was pretty much hard again, even fully hard.</p> <p>"It's so nice," I said.</p> <p>She started moving her head on me again. "Oh, yeah," she whispered.</p> <p>She sucked and licked until I'd almost lost my erection. She then pulled me down toward her again and licked the whole length of my cock until my head was almost at the opening of her pussy. But again, she stopped at the beginning of her first move.</p> <p>"There!" she gasped. "It's all right! Just relax."</p> <p>And, as I had expected, she just started going at me again.</p> <p>"No, I don't want to come yet so don't expect it," I said.</p> <p>"Go ahead," she pleaded.</p> <p>"No, wait," I said. "I want to do this."</p> <p>"Go ahead."</p> <p>I slid my cock slowly into my wife's pussy, making sure it was fully inside her and feeling the tight, warm embrace, the wet, silky, insides of her cunt. Just as she was ready I pulled a bit back from her.</p> <p>"Go ahead, don't stop. It'll just feel better soon."</p> <p>She took her mouth off my cock and looked so happy. As I began moving in and out of her again, she looked at me like I was a little boy waiting for a good time to be had.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!" my lovely wife said, "Take my husband!"</p> <p>"You can be a bitch too," I smiled at her.</p> <p>The other time she wanted to make a slutty noise was an understatement.</p> <p>"Fuck!" she screamed in excitement as my cock bottomed out with each stroke from a new pussy. "That's nice!"</p> <p>"Fuck, you're right," I mumbled. "You're always so fucking beautiful!"</p> <p>She grabbed my ass with both hands and tried to get both our groins to slam together.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Take me!"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm going to," I said, pumping my cock hard inside my wife.</p> <p>"Yeah," she whispered as I increased my speed. "Take me!"</p> <p>She grabbed my ass with both fists pulling me forward, trying to pull me into her.</p> <p>We were at the height, only now, and I didn't want to slow down.</p> <p>"Yeah! take me!"</p> <p>"Go fuck her! Yeah! Take her!"</p> <p>"Yeah!"</p> <p>"Yeah!"</p> <p>"Take me!" she kept screaming as I saw us get closer together again.</p> <p>I kept on pumping my cock into her, feeling the whole length of her well-lubricated pussy, feeling the slick juices, watching my cock sink in and out of her, feeling the soft walls slide around it making me harder all the deeper still, more aware of our bodies, our souls separate bodies, all of the ecstasy.</p> <p></p> <p>the rhythm building into the rhythm that first time, oneâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
