He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, where the icy perspiration stood in beads. This was no infidelity to Cosette; it was a gentle and</strong> loving thing that needed to happen. It was the thing to make all the heartbeats a happy time. He wanted to be with, love with Marryelia.</p> <p>A slow smile broke out on his lips. She was in the mood to get him hard, so her hips were swaying and she was grinding her clit against his crotch. He ran one hand up her shirt to cup her perfect boob. They were perky and they felt great. He was still wearing his pants, but they were so small that he barely felt the skin of them. He had never really wanted anything more. But, since he had already fucked her, he didn't want to be just about to fall asleep. He slid the straps of her bra off her shoulder, and slid the straps of the bra off of her chest. She threw the bra on the floor. Then she pushed him down on his back and quickly sucked his cock into her mouth, all the way down to the base of his balls. Marryelia started by giving him a little blowjob. She had been doing this for years, so it was like a good job of a professional. She bobbed up and down, while stroking and sucking his cock. He got a little harder, and he liked it when she made him cum. In fact, he was already getting a little excited. He could feel how stiff the skin on his cock was, even though it wasn't hard. It was a feeling and one that seemed both erotic and scary.</p> <p>Marryelia was definitely horny, that was for sure. She was trying to put as much feeling in every bit of her body, without having much trouble. He felt like he could feel a million butterflies fluttering around his heart as she sucked him harder, swallowing his cock a little deeper. He was already hard enough to get hard, which wasn't hard considering his position, although he still got some difficulty with her. But, it was a matter of a little extra pleasure. There was always some pleasure worth a lot of agony, just to reach the maximum of ecstasy.</p> <p>His hands rested on the back of the couch, as Marryelia pulled off of his cock with a lewd expression. The moment was worth more than he could ever express, for he wanted to make her feel as good as she made him feel.</p> <p>"Fuck! Marry, I'm going to cum if you don't stop."</p> <p>"Not yet, you can hold out for a little while longer."</p> <p>Marryelia released his cock, and quickly slid off the couch. She was kneeling on the floor in front of him. Her mouth was right in front of his cock, and she was using both hands and giving him a hard and dirty blowjob. He was getting a real good blowjob from his very own sex goddess Marryla Sanchez. She had really learned well, and Marryla had learned to do better. Marryla's smile was even more sexy than it was earlier. She took the head of his cock into her mouth and sucked it a little harder and deeper. It was almost as good as when they had sex. It was nothing like a big dildo to her, because she really enjoyed it, which was the whole point.</p> <p>He groaned and moaned and bucked against her mouth. He couldn't get enough of her mouth and head. He couldn't believe that she took all of him into her mouth. He wanted to keep going, as hard as he could, but Marryla was going to make him cum. She knew that, and she was going to make him cum in her mouth. Even though he was not a super-sensitive guy, Marryla knew how to do it. She had always worked for speed and precision, though usually it took a few seconds to get him to the point of no return. This was so different. She knew right from getting ready with speed that she made him want to shoot his load in her mouth by sucking hard and biting down, which really did it, in her job. Marryelia seemed to like the result though. When she wanted to have him cum, she was going to give him a mouthful of sperm. She held the base of his manhood in her hands as she bobbed her head up and down. She was sure that with a little tongue work, it would make the next load better. In fact, all of the cum she could swallow was mostly from the base of her tongue job, but some of the cum was really flowing through her mouth, and down her throat, which she liked.</p> <p>This is how she always made him cum. As soon or later were always, he knew how to stay focused on pleasure. She was determined to do that. She enjoyed his cock sucking and suck and licking is her tongue job. All her mouth or cunt or mouth or cunt would let her work.</p> <p></p> <p>Her tongue or work or she wanted—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
