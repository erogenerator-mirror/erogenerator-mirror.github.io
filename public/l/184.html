The Lee Shore.</h4><p><strong>Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn. When on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive</strong>, red-faced body up against the white painted barrier to its walls. The long shaft began to stiffen. She opened her blouse, bra, and panties and began groping at her breasts. The man lifted one to her mouth. The other came down, his mouth covered her naked, pink, smooth mound and found her clitoris. It is hard, she thought, and it is stiff and throbbing and the man’s finger feels like a rod.</p> <p>He rolled the swollen bud and began to twist it up. His hand pressed on the wall of the barrier. His dick was hard. It began to swell. She saw the shape of the head swell out, and she closed her eyes and began to breathe raggedly. She felt the pressure of the bulge push up on her belly. She arched her back and stretched and parted her legs.</p> <p>The fat man began to rub the tip, which felt slick. Then he opened the lips of her labia and pressed the head of his cock on it. He slid down until the shaft was firmly and snugly inside her.</p> <p>“Uuunngggghhhh.” she hissed through her teeth. The hot shaft drove fully into her, her insides pushing up at each thrust. Her hips came up to meet the first thrusting of the man.</p> <p>He kept up the steady fucking while she spread her legs and leaned her head back. She knew what he would want to do. He would want to take her on her bed, right above the bed on which the white-covered, bare-breasted man in the window was watching them. It was all the things which she had fantasized about with George, George, George and even the women at the hotel, the other women at the boudoir, but it was now, she was here to satisfy that fantasy of her, to have sex with that man.</p> <p>The big man was now pounding into her with all his force. Her hips bounced in response. She pushed her shoulders back to maximize the effect of fucking back against him, which was working, she realized.</p> <p>“Oh. . . yes. . .” she cried out. Then she heard the man grunting and felt his cock spasm inside her. The man behind her began to spasm, and she could feel it in her rectum. Her whole body shuddered with the wave, and she had a shuddering orgasmic climax. The man, who had just been fucking her in the boudoir behind her, felt it too, which triggered the big man’s orgasm.</p> <p>Then, he was coming on her. His body jerked and he thrust violently and repeatedly and long, and she felt his cock spasm as he did, until finally, he slid down her body, the big man withdrawing his cock, and left her, laying there.</p> <p>“What a fucking slut. . .” she thought. Then she began to laugh.</p> <p>That’s the problem with my stories,” she thought.</p> <p>[Sid was not really an author, but he was one of the original inventors of my first series.]—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
