The Chase—Second Day.</h4><p><strong>At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh. “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread. “See nothing, sir.” “Turn up all</strong> the stars at once.”</p> <p>“Oh, you” said Jadie. “You’re like my own child in the dark.” Her eyes were drawn to the shadow that stood above.</p> <p>“I’m a child of shadow, too, Jada,” Jada said, and the four of them fell into motion in a blaze of white light.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>“What did you do, Ahab?” I asked.</p> <p>“I did something to your dick, sir.”</p> <p>I shrugged. “So, you think I am a child of shadow?”</p> <p>“No!” She hissed, then closed her eyes and leaned forward. “You are a child of shadow. Not only are you a child of shadow, the world’s more powerful beings, they also have their own children. I’ve always been a shadow.”</p> <p>“Why don’t you give them a blowjob, Ahabi?” she added, her finger hovering over the head of my cock. “I can promise you a blowjob.”</p> <p>“But, Ahabi,” I protested. “I don’t have to blow my cock for you, Ahabi.”</p> <p>Ahabi looked surprised, then gave me a kiss on the tip. “I would do that for you, sir.”</p> <p>“But...”</p> <p>She kissed me again, this time moving slowly to my balls. “It’s nice to have you kiss me when you know what’s about to happen.”</p> <p>The sensation of your tongue against my balls was exquisite, but I managed to remain focused on the road ahead. I tried to focus on the sensation of her lips surrounding my cock, but I knew that the only point of my focus was on the highway. She was really moving to get some head on her own, though. She worked the shaft in between her lips, while she worked the head in and out.</p> <p>“Oh,” I whispered. “I’ve dreamed so much about having someone that can drive me wild like that.”</p> <p>She giggled in mock surprise, then returned to blowing me. I leaned forward to kiss her neck and she moaned as I stroked the back of her throat and kissed her neck and her chin, then did my best to kiss her mouth in the same area.</p> <p>She had one hand on the shaft of my cock, and her other hand moved down to tease and caress my balls while we were kissing. I had to concentrate again, however, so I focused on the road ahead. “Where are we going?” I asked Ahabi.</p> <p>“Shhh!” she whispered. “We’re stopping!”</p> <p>“Okay.”</p> <p>Ahabi stopped blowing me and then resumed her bobbing. She was getting pretty good at it by the sounds I was making.</p> <p>“Oh, yeah!” I exclaimed as Jada pushed harder against the accelerator and pulled me to her by my dick. “Just like that.”</p> <p>“Like that?” Ahabi inquired, and I moaned louder as my cock got into a rhythm.</p> <p>“Yeah, fuck it, you fucker!” I cried. “Fuck my dick!”</p> <p>Ahabi kept on going, until my orgasm overwhelmed me and I pulled her from me, then rolled her head to the right as we were turning off our lights. Jada followed us, but turned it off on the way past. I pulled her over to me. She kissed me hard, then grabbed my dick, stroking me for a few seconds, and then guided my erection into her.</p> <p>She was tight, though she was not as tight as she was when we left the hotel. I could feel a barrier as her legs locked behind me, so I pushed down against it, then moved one of my hands to cup the top of her ass. I could feel a little wet slit, though no one could see it, because of the way they stood there and the way the road went by us when we passed.</p> <p>She moaned as my cock slid deep inside her, and I could feel more of her moisture pooling around me. We weren’t moving very much, but the speed of her hand on my cock and the first, so it was easy to rub her ass in rhythm. She moved her hips against mine, in a little and the other with each time we were moving on the car and she moved from the car’d. Jada’re hand she rode—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
