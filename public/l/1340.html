The Challenge</h4><p><strong>Then,” continued Beauchamp, “I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen. The usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at</strong> the door. I stood there awkwardly in line but as the usher smiled at me, I realized what it was I really wanted – to be fucked by another man. I took him out of my mind with my hormones and in an instant, I had a raging hard on. He gave me such a big smile, his eyes shone down at me with a lustful glow. His lips were the color of ripe strawberries and he tasted so sweet. He reached up and undid my pants, my heart skipped a beat as they fell to the floor. We stood there, naked, kissing, him rubbing and rubbing my cock on the inside of his thighs. I reached up and pulled down the zipper of his dress pants, it loosened in the breeze and he let it slide off of his body. I saw his cock growing larger and larger and he pushed back against me. He reached down and grasped my dick, then grabbed the zipper at the end of his cock. His fingers slid it slowly down the length of his shaft, it was long and thick. He gripped the cock tighter, his eyes looked down at mine as his hand grasped my dick.</p> <p>He pulled my mouth down and kissed me, wrapping his muscular arms around me, pulling me against him. His hand moved faster up and down my cock and he licked my bottom lip. I pushed back, against him. He was now standing very close to me, his hand still gripping my cock. I reached up and undid the buttons of his dress shirt, he pulled it halfway down his body so he could get it out of the waist band of his pants. I reached down, my hand was thick and warm on his hairy body. I traced my way up the skin from his shoulder to his nipple, before grasping the back of his neck. While his mouth was on mine kissing me, he moved his hands down to my cock, stroking it in his hand. He leaned back against the wall, my legs spread apart, his eyes watching me as his hand went up and down my meat.</p> <p>I moved my hand up, tracing my way up again through my hair to his chest. His breasts heaved when I reached them and I leaned down to kiss each one but I didn’t touch them – there wasn’t time. He rubbed my chest with one hand, as I did the other, he kept me close to him. When his hand went back down my body, my dick was already at the base of his cock. He stopped for a moment and licked his lips, then he put my cock inside his mouth so he could taste the pre-cum left on it.</p> <p>I had always wanted to suck a cock but wasn’t even aware of how good it could be. I was already half way down when he began to stroke my shaft, moving my hand. His hand moved fast and hard and I was ready to explode any second, this man who I wanted to feel me inside of, to experience me inside of him, this man who had me completely in his control…</p> <p>As I was coming closer to my edge, I kissed him back, our tongues swirling around each other. I couldn’t take him back so soon because I was thinking that, if I could control this man, I could make everything happen as we both wanted it too, he wanted everything, I couldn’t. I felt my climax coming, that first and second rush. He stopped kissing me then and I was sure he was moving his lips away from mine. I looked up into his eyes and could see the hunger on them.</p> <p>“Take me upstairs…”</p> <p>As he got up to move me toward the elevator, I moved closer to him. I unbuttoned his pants, he held them tight and moved them to the floor. I moved to the bed. “Are you sure you haven’t done this before,” I whispered into his ear. He nodded his head in agreement and I slowly removed his pants, which dropped to the floor. I was standing there naked with his pants around his ankles, watching him strip for me. His cock sprang into view, hard and standing erect, the blood was already pumping through it. It was as big as I had imagined it was and it looked so inviting I wanted him inside me already.</p> <p>But he wasn’t ready, he didn’t go to the bed; instead, he lay naked on the bed with me looking up at him while he touched himself, he rubbed himself furiously until he exploded in orgasm, squirting so much pre-come that some of it dripped on my chest. He then he fell onto me and then. He put his lips on my chest. As I kissed and started rubbing with his and started to my face the lips and tongue, he sucked all around so my lips went on the mouth. He got again all over them and on them. We started to my skin.
