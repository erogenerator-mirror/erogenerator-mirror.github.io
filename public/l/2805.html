You are my new favorite student; you just go to town, and we'll be along in ten seconds."</p> <p>She had never been with a boy before, and he was obviously a beginner or young man, but she sensed that there must be some talent at manipulation, and it sure would be very easy. They would go to a good concert; he'd go to one with her. If that made it easy, so be it. But why would they do it now? He must have seen her as more than just a freshman; she was no-one's fuck buddy. Just the thought made her quiver.</p> <p>She felt a bit of a drowsy in her sleep. She heard the front door to her dorm room crack open.</p> <p>"Well hello, girl!"</p> <p>She tried to raise herself up on the top bunk to sit still, but her clothes were a bit looser than she thought. One button was undone, the other a bit too far. Maybe it was the weather. She hoped not - the room was chilly, but that didn't stop her from getting out of bed. She felt silly standing there. She had always been more graceful in the shower, but now she felt like a naked teen. Maybe this was going to be a bit of a waste. The door cracked again and she heard the click of the door lock. She was scared to leave the room, too afraid to stand and look at herself in the mirror until this intruder came. And it really was a nice, hot mug in the corner of her bed, like a perfect match for her body. Even if he hadn't noticed - though his hair looked to be gray and had streaks of blue - he could have guessed exactly what she had on.</p> <p>"Well, well, that'll do me for Christmas."</p> <p>A smile spread across her lips and the hand that was inside her pants went up to her breast.</p> <p>"Oh, hi, you like that?"</p> <p>She was surprised by the voice. She'd heard that many of the boys in her class thought that a big-breasted girl's breasts were ugly and undesirable, so she hadn't expected anyone to be talking to her - it had been just for them to hear.</p> <p>"Yes, I like it very much."</p> <p>"Well it seems I'm going to have to be naked," he said, as though she had no more important words to say.</p> <p>She was almost to the door when his voice, with a lot more confidence, went straight into her ear.</p> <p>"No, I've gotta do this," he said.</p> <p>"Oh, but just for me," she said, and her skirt slid up higher on her hips, exposing her panties.</p> <p>"You better," he said, and then he was on her again, thrusting himself into her, thrusting into her, over and over again, almost forcing himself into her vagina.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, God, I love it," she heard herself saying, as though in agreement with her own words. It was a very short version of what she usually heard. Maybe it was just that his cock was far bigger than the guy's cock - and he was fucking her as hard and as fast and as good a lover as her boyfriend. She felt his own penis sliding up and down the inside of her pussy and felt his balls slapping her thighs. She wondered if he might want her to be on her knees on the end of the bed while he was doing her - she thought the idea was great, but she also wondered how it would feel while she was bending over the edge of the bed, her skirt bunched up around her waist, being fucked while her boyfriend was standing with his cock in her pussy. Was it about her boyfriend or about the way she seemed to enjoy being fucked?</p> <p>He was still fucking her pussy when her hand went to the front of her panties, unbuttoning them, and then she felt her panties being opened for him. She had no idea that, while her boyfriend's dick was still fucking her pussy, his hands were on her hips, and they would be moving her around a lot now. The idea that even the idea that that might happen made her so horny, with her being in the dark, had her hand squeezing the front of her bra, and her other hand had pulled her blouse open right off.</p> <p>They fucked like that for almost an hour, with her moaning and gasping, him grunting and calling her name. They went on for three of these three more time, but still, and at various times, and the same and is the fourth day but they went on with the first meeting and with second time. Sometimes he's, she was when he fuckedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
