Cab whistles blowing frantically in all directions. Pedestrians running for shelter into the market and under the portico of St.</strong> Cloud; and a storm pelted through the night through the open window of the main building with a loud crash, accompanied by the high voltage hum of the electric and weather-control unit that had just shuttled into the main area of the venue. Even the police could listen this was dangerous, especially in one of the city's greatest historic buildings, and she felt her heart swell with excitement at the thought of rescuing that man. She was about to leave that building herself, but a dark cell door to the back of the building was opened with the sounds of a radio crackling on top of a radio set. A woman in her late thirties entered the cell, wearing a dark suit, holding a keypad which was inserted into the reader's hand. The metal door clanged shut just inches away from her, and a white, white light flashed, followed by a muffled gasp. The white light reflected off the black plastic of the device covering whatever, at that moment, she might as well have been a normal blouse and trousers combination. The light went a bit dark once more, and the door opened briefly. She looked around, and found the man standing at one of the large, round-shaped metal doors. She quickly moved forward to the front of the man, and wrapped her small hand around his neck, pulling him towards her. Both of their hearts raced at the proximity of this large, powerful and attractive man, a couple of inches from their faces. Neither of them needed to tell how they were going to be. Both of them were going to go the very next step: embrace.</p> <p>The man stepped back as she pushed him forwards. His lips brushed hers, their passion obvious between the two of them. She leaned forward with him, as if she could take him all the way into her mouth without having to think about backing away. He met her lips with his, his tongue penetrating her, and she tasted herself on his lips. He leaned on the door; their bodies grinding against each other as they locked lips together. She moaned into his mouth, and reached up to run one hand through his short, dark hair. Her fingers tugged and tugged at his shoulder and neck, as if to urge him on. He groaned as he kissed her back, and she kissed him back, and he pulled her tighter against him. He pushed the top of her skirt upwards, to expose one thigh, and slid a hand up the other, sliding his fingers beneath the fabric of her panties, moving against the fabric with her soft, moist lips. He pushed her skirt higher up her thigh, his fingers slipping out of his pants easily, as he looked at the gorgeous body of her body on the other side of him now, his hand sliding over her backside. The thought of being able to feel her all over was almost enough to send her over the edge just as quickly! Her fingers went back to caressing his skin as she ran her tongue over his lips, savouring their flavour together. She felt his cock getting hard beneath her, and it seemed like they were both getting more desperate by the minute. He took one of her nipples between her finger and thumb, pinching it gently between his fingers.</p> <p>She broke eye contact with him, as she lowered down to her knees in front of him, and slid her fingers off his balls, rubbing them against her nose. She inhaled his odour, smelling his sweat and cum, feeling his muscles as he gripped her head and pulled her onto him. He groaned loudly as she licked and sucked that salty-sweet treat from his balls, swallowing the rest. He pulled her face up to gaze down at her, his eyes pleading with hers. 'Kneel, woman,' he commanded, and she quickly obeyed as he stepped around her, pulling her up on the nearest bench, her lips clinging to his. He lifted her to her feet, then bent her forward over the bench. She felt his hand on her upper back, lifting her, spreading her, and then slid his throbbing member into her. She cried out again, as he slowly pumped his length into her, her breasts bouncing. He grabbed the shoulders and leaned forwards from the bench, placing a hand on either side of her head for better balance. He pushed into her as hard and as fast as he could, his cock sliding smoothly into her wetness, balls slapping against her, head bumping her clit. She leaned to one side, and he moved a hand down to grip her hips, pulling her back onto him as he thrust in and out of her again and again. Her breathing quickened, her eyes glassed up with sexual heat, while he fucked her. She felt her clitoris throbbing pulse in rhythm against her, and, and felt him pumping at her, and his fingers rubbing at the walls, pushing inside her, rubbing in and her. She felt herself. Her vagina gripped and her back and all inside her, his hand, squeezingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
