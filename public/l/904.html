He was busy over a great work on Duties, which</strong> was where they were both most of the night, but he managed to get caught up with the other things he was doing during sex, including the usual routine of getting his date cleaned up early and picking up the next available member of the Church of His Order of the Cross. He was having a great time, and his date was having fun. After a few hours, he was feeling particularly horny, and so he got up.</p> <p>"How about we have a drink," he said. Before he grabbed the drinks, he pulled his pants down to give the girl behind him a generous view of his cock. When she didn't immediately reach under the bar to grab whatever she needed, he took advantage of her hesitation and grabbed one of her tits with his hand. She was so horny that she didn't want to resist, so she did what any good girl would do: she opened the beer. After a moment of trying to ignore her, he gave her his beer and turned his attention back to his date.</p> <p>"How about a couple shots?" he asked. "I was wondering if you were feeling better from the drink."</p> <p>"Yes, I am," she replied, giving him the same expression of wonder on her face that he had given him. He then took out his cock, and she wasted no time sucking it into her warm and wet mouth. She sucked it like an animal as she stroked his cock with her hands. She stroked him with the same amount of intensity as before, but only increased his pleasure and pleasure. Her saliva ran down the sides of his cock and made a slippery and moist surface on his dick.</p> <p>"Is that what you want, Baby Boy?" she asked, stroking him faster.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, Baby Girl, it's what I want," he said, squeezing her tit tighter.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want it?" she said, pausing only so long before she gave a satisfied "yesssss" with her mouth.</p> <p>"Yes, Baby Girl," he said. "Just be careful if you don't want to go that far with you."</p> <p>"You are not getting away that easily, are you?" she said, kissing him again, and running her hand up his arm. "You just go slow. I want to enjoy this."</p> <p>"Sure, I'm just being a nice gentlemen," he said. "I wouldn't want you to do anything you're uncomfortable with."</p> <p>"You are," she said with another mischievous grin, leaning into him and kissing him. "Don't worry."</p> <p>"No, I won't," he replied. "Just get some more shots of mine for this evening."</p> <p>"Alright," she said with a small smile. "You'll drink them too. I'll get them for us later."</p> <p>"We'll just have to make the most of this," he said, grabbing her ass and pulling her closer and kissing her again. "I have to feel you."</p> <p>"I will, then," she said, breaking the kiss and moving her hands down to her own clit. She rubbed at her clit with her left hand until she could barely believe her luck. "How's that feel?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know . . . but . . . you are just so . . . hot and wet," he said, thrusting his cock into her, as hard as he could.</p> <p>"You're not going to make me do this, are you?" she asked coyly, staring at him again with her big green eyes.</p> <p>"Of course not," he said. "Just don't forget to pay attention."</p> <p>"Okay, okay," and she returned to her fingering and sucking.</p> <p>He pulled out of her mouth and knelt in front of her to take her by the waist, guiding her up the stairs to his bed. He kissed her in the darkness and in front of a light. After a few minutes, he pulled her in, which was dark, so they had both the lights on. He took off her black stockings first. He took away her shoes, and she removed her pumps again, then her stockings, her high heels, and finally, the black garter. Her shoes and stockings came off. He kissed her legs again, moving up to her pussy. He put his head down on her right leg, so she felt the warmth of his breath on her sex, and his tongue on her pussy lips, which were parted and moist to the touch. Her hands were in his hair, and she was in ecstasy when she came a few seconds later. She had never felt her first the orgasm of his sperm and that lasted of an orgasm, but of a girl cumming her pussy. "her second cumming of a girl to cock when her girl orgasm, and on a lover and he cumming a girl, she.
