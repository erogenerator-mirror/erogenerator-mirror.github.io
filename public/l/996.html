And he knew this, of course. His body is all muscle and a good number of men and women have just about got the cock.</p> <p>“Jeanette, darling,” his voice sounded thick and melodiously loud in my ear, “I’m sorry. I know you’ll come round to your own funeral tomorrow.”</p> <p>I turned to whisper in his ear.</p> <p>At first he was embarrassed to ask me this, but when I saw how big his cock got when he was aroused, it made him feel so guilty. And when he did, it felt like he’d had an orgasm at some stage. I’d told Jeanette all about my feelings for him.</p> <p>“But baby,” I thought to myself, “why in hell does he have to be with such a beautiful woman?”</p> <p>“Do you wanna be my fuck?” I looked him straight in his eyes and said.</p> <p>“Yes, please” he said eagerly, “please fuck me.”</p> <p>I moved forward, putting my knees either side of his hips and moved my cock up and down the underside of his cock, rubbing it and rubbing it on his balls. I loved watching him fuck, I could see the excitement in his eyes when he was about to cum, I liked that he was ready to shoot his semen.</p> <p>“Do you think you can come, baby?” I asked him.</p> <p>“God yes” he breathed, “I can’t believe I’m here with you in the Church of England.”</p> <p>His words were just the encouragement that I needed, the encouragement that Jeanette had been providing. I started to move my cock up and down that soft, smooth cock. I could feel the tightness of the foreskin, feel it slide up and down on my hard cock in my hands as I continued to tease it and tease the man's cock.</p> <p>And Jeanette had her legs spread wide, holding herself up on her elbows, and her feet were pressed together, so that his cock was now up within it. And she was fucking him and I was fingering her clit with my own fingers while I had hold of his hand.</p> <p>I thought he wouldn’t cum, but then with Jeanette groaning and sighing and shouting for him, he lost control and let himself be fucked, and I could feel it as he spurt his cum up into my cock. There was only one thing left to do, but I didn’t care, I fucked Jeanette.</p> <p>There was nothing wrong to stop with anything, nothing at all. Jeanette knew how to fuck and how to kiss, how to touch and lick and suck. That cock of his, that cock in her mouth and her pussy, there was only one thing left that I had in store for it.</p> <p>I put my cum covered hand on his chest, and as soon as my hand touched his cock, he got it up to me, and we were both ready to take it in turns. He would lay back and I would climb on. I slid down to where I felt at his cock just below it, and when I put my legs up on his shoulders, I saw his heart beating in his ears, and he got what I came for.</p> <p>We kissed one another all over while we fucked, taking our time and enjoying each other’s company. I kissed my way from Jeanette's breasts to her pussy, feeling her wet and swollen against my tongue, feeling the warmth of her juices. She moaned and cried and cried, feeling her boyfriend’s tongue on her clit and pussy, feeling the hot cum inside her.</p> <p>I got my hands under his arms and he lifted his head, kissing me as he was.</p> <p>“Jeanette,” I whispered. “You taste wonderful.”</p> <p>“I like to think,” she said, smiling up at me, “but you are all I can think of.”</p> <p>“You have a lovely mouth, baby” I told him, “a lovely tongue.”</p> <p>“Honey, we have time.”</p> <p>“No,” I said, “we do.”</p> <p>We lay there on the floor for a while, enjoying the glow of the Church downpour. At first, I thought that we were out there having fallen asleep, that the noise of falling rain is so heavy. But when she reached over my head I felt the world that it was a different. But that in my life on her she that was so big in there—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
