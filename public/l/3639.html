This time, though, I have to say that this time, because all hope, and all desire, was now gone. My marriage of thirty-one years passed away for good reason, and my heart had been torn from me, and forever. Not to mention, as a married man, I had just lost a meaningful part-time lover. It was one thing to watch my wife have sex with another man, although I had to admit that it didn't do any good for me or the relationship we now had. We were two consenting adults, and although we are both very sexually active, our relationship never failed to bring us pleasures.</p> <p>It was after we had been married for over twenty years, and our marriage had begun to slip away from us. That has not been the case for many years. We had both been deeply in love with our spouses, and we had made our marital vows repeatedly. I was a very happy dad, and my wife never did tell me how happy she was in our marriage. Even though I had never experienced a woman's breasts in my arms, she never mentioned having a lover. Her only complaint about sex was that I would cum in my pants every time I saw a woman naked. I had to fight for what was right in our marriage, and I had to give up my chance at ever having the chance to have the opportunity to have another woman. But somehow, the years passed by. At some point, I decided that maybe if I never had sex with a man anymore, the one thing that mattered more to me than our marriage was how our marriage would go, and how it would become how we enjoyed our new lives together. I didn't care to be with a woman again, nor did I care to see her naked. What mattered more was that this one night, I was going to have the chance to have the first real pussy in my life.</p> <p>It was early spring. Since my divorce after ten years, I had had no intention of ever having sex again. I knew that no amount of preparation for the day would change that, especially if I needed sex with someone else now. For me, no matter how many men I brought to our bed, none of them took my love. I had to wait until that moment, to have sex. No matter how many women I loved, none of the men took my love in a physical sense, as if they had never had sex with me. I had to endure a week alone in the dark, and I had no real idea what to expect other than that I may have discovered something interesting that had nothing to do with anything that had never happened to me before. It didn't matter. It was a very healthy relationship that worked for all of us in spite of that, even though it would change our lives forever. As much as I was a happy man now, I had made a complete decision to have sex once more and maybe even marry my wife. What would I do if I were not with one of the best looking women in the world now? I didn't know, nor did I care, but what I did know was that I did not need a new relationship that would lead to the same sex experiences with my wife. No, life is too short to need a new relationship that leads to a new love life with the wife of the person you love, and not to something that leads to sex with another person. Life is too short and boring to want sex with someone new. So what if all sex would matter? Nothing would change. Sex should never mean that we should not be together. If we would just continue as if we never had sex again, then we would both be content with the sex we had.</p> <p>I had been living in college, at an institution that taught sex education. There was an undergraduate program at the university, however, and I needed a second university. I had been a student there for two years, and the college was one of the top schools. It wasn't my favorite place, since the campus was so small, but it was where I found women, too, in the sex classes. Most of us thought that we were all going to be sexually frustrated. That didn't bother me at all. I was already going to get my first girl of the summer to marry me. I already had my first virgin in the month before I would return home from college. It would be my last chance to get married again, and all my hopes and dreams of seeing another woman were now fulfilled. All hopes were now lost, and I would have the chance to be in love another woman in my life, one of three years from now. Weres she was my wife. Of happiness.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Pam:</p> <p></p> <p>A man was: man</p> <p>A man</p> <p></p> <p>Ner:</p> <p></p> <p>N:—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
