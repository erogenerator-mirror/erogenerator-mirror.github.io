Within a very little while, thou wilt be either ashes, or a</h4><p><strong>sceletum; and a name perchance; and perchance, not so much as a name. And what is that but an empty sound, and a rebounding echo? Those things which in this</strong> world are only for people who have experienced the pleasures of the flesh.</p> <p>My first, I say was the night before, when I went to the bath, washed myself, and then sat in the tub, soaking in the perfumed body of my goddess of love. How could that be? Who could ever imagine that a woman of such pure, innocent beauty could be so sexually attracted to her, so deeply aroused? What would it be like if that woman were a creature of flesh and blood? But for me, it would be like a wild thing.</p> <p>I sat there, in the tub of the tub, nakedness enveloping me with the touch of water droplets on my skin; and the sound of water hitting my nipples and down upon them. I imagined their touch, and their sounds against the skin of my breasts. I think I would do just that. In fact, I masturbated, and it wasn't the first time that night. My clitoris tingled as I did so, and a wave of delicious pleasure surged upon my face, down, around, through it in a spasm, and across my whole body. I came hard.</p> <p>I thought to myself as I sat there in the water that I ought not to be so inclined. But my clitoris, as hard as my nipples, had been, even for me. And yet, I still needed something in it-- something that I might like if I did what I knew I should. I wanted everything that I would never be able to be with a man, anything any man could make me do. I wanted it so badly. My heart ached at the moment as I watched myself, masturbating furiously; so that even that simple thought of my beloved's body in heat did not matter to me.</p> <p>At first, I decided that it would be best to wait a little longer; for our passions had reached a fever which might bring the separation of our bodies. But I held on to it as long as I could, and I have had my passions for some time.</p> <p>At last, I washed myself, and dried my hair. But in my mind's eye, I saw nothing; I had seen nothing while I was in the tub of the tub with the body of my goddess of love. I felt nothing except the water caressing me as the air cooled my cheeks; the touch of the water on my head and scalp, just a caress from the water, but not the caress to my breasts; the caress to my inner thighs; and the touch of the water on my sex.</p> <p>It would be just as well to go through through the same process, to see all that is there; even with the water still touching it. But I was troubled by something else. Had the time flown by and we had not enjoyed the first time of our relationship, I must have made the mistake of leaving the tub. If it had been the first time with my lover, then the second time, with my love, and this was only one part of it, then so would I, I thought, and then I must've made a mistake! Then, I wondered what I wanted to do. I had had thoughts in my head since I entered the tub, but it had never been as the kind of feelings I had had in all the years of my marriage to Tom, and still I have only had one such thought.</p> <p>Well, I was troubled enough about what I wished, however, for a change. I wanted, in the same way I wished for an evening with my lover. I said to myself "Why not?", and put aside the questions of where my heart wanted it to go in the first place, and thought to myself, "It will certainly go elsewhere. Why else do I have this problem? It is my fault, and he had nothing to do with it!"</p> <p>But I knew I had to try and get ahead of myself, and I had to tell myself: "We are two people. If I have my way, it will happen. And if it isn't, I want to continue, but not have it yet." I decided to try to put things off for a fortnight, just for a change of pace.</p> <p>After that, I knew, and saw by my actions, that I was losing my best approach. It was difficult trying not to make me feel like I was looking to escape, so I thought that it was best I decided my approach first, and then I would not feel so helpless in what I did next.</p> <p>I went out to the bathroom to wash the last bit of the water from my body. I dried, again, before walking back, out of the bathroom. I was a little apprehensive, having made my body known a little while. much too much too much too soon. than it was to be in my intention. I wanted to show off my best.</p> <p>in inâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
