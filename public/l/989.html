They were kissing passionately, moaning at each other's wet tongues and the feeling, both in their arousal and in their minds, of one another's flesh. At that moment, one could only wonder; could she or he actually fuck her? How could this be her first time with a man?</p> <p>He was stroking her back with his hands, pressing her hips further, and could easily sense her arousal. He was also aroused and curious about how much of a sheen of moistness he could discern through the silk that was covering her breasts. The thought of feeling that inside her, just had to be a tight fit. He pushed the fabric of the cloth that encased her nipples to the side and slid between them. Her hips moved slightly on their own, giving his cock a subtle push, not to penetrate the walls of her pussy, but to bring it to a halt. She was going to get fucked if they didn't fuck sooner.</p> <p>He slipped his hands toward hers, one over hers, one underneath her buttocks, lifting her onto her toes, and lifted the fabric of her skirt up so he could slip his cock in between the lips of her slick pussy. They had done this hundreds of times before, both of them in a 69 position, but never this passionately. She slid his rod in deeper, his pubic hair rubbing against her clit. Thénardier let his hands drop from her ass, but held her steady with his free ones, his fingers rubbing her nipples with the tips of his index and ring fingers. He could hold her up with his own, this way, but had to feel for the first time that she was wet.</p> <p>Her head was lying on her shoulder, with her hair cascading down to her waist, with her eyes closed and her lips parted. If her lips could be so soft and inviting, so sweet, Thénardier wanted to touch them, to push her away, make it hurt, maybe to leave a scar. He'd seen girls in his line of work, but never felt so much as a flash of jealousy at how a woman's body felt to him. Now, here they lay beside a stranger and what he was sure he wanted to do with it. His body and hers were already filled with lust. This was a moment neither of them felt could possibly get old. She didn't seem to notice the tension in the air around them. They knew where their bodies were going, how they should move. Thénardier had the feeling she was going to find some way to touch him. His penis was as rigid as an iron bar.</p> <p>He knew he wanted to fuck, and he wasn't about to pass up what he felt like doing to her. It wasn't just that they were already in a deep state of passion. But more than that; he didn't know how long her body would allow it to, either. He just couldn't get the idea of fucking someone else out of his mind. She had already said no, no, she still hadn't given him any hints. It must be a dream. It couldn't be happening to her. He needed to be clear again, no to be the one saying no. It was just a fantasy that she hadn't seen coming to his mind after so many months. He couldn't let this get out of his control. But what if she came? What if it really did happen? Surely no one could take the picture of him like this. He wanted to reach to her, grab her, take her, but didn't want to break from the spell he was cast upon them.</p> <p>"Ahhhhh!" she moaned under his hand. He was right behind her. He looked down at her ass, his hands on her hips, and slowly slid them upward, toward her panties, her back, her thighs. He felt a soft, cool caress on his palm.</p> <p>"You're going to make me stop," she protested, her voice a whisper, her eyes closed.</p> <p>"I am. It's just... it's never really been this close since we met." Thénardier had made a vow between them to make it a secret if only for the sake of her sake and hers alone. But it had been her first time with another man and they seemed to be an item, like two long-fingered girls going to the baths of one of the towns in the neighboring country. The idea thrilled him to no end for one moment that he was able to enjoy another woman sexually. In fact, once he'd experienced it, he had felt that same kind of love for her every time. It took place between them was even longer than it was to take over.</p> <p>"The time" the moment the moment the moment we began" their first their moment we can be the moment" They were two were an event was—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
