If he happened to be someone she should have known her eyes would be closed, and she would be masturbating.</p> <p>Mr. Collins was not a boy. He was the most gorgeous boy here in the world. And if anything happened to him, it would be some of the world's best and most powerful men.

Are we going to put it down?"</p> <p>The youth didn't reply, still holding her in his arms, his fingers gliding over her skin, and finally lifting his hands away.</p> <p>"Thank you, young man," she said, smiling again, and gently sliding off the bed.
