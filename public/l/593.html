He pulled out a bottle of olive oil and some paper he had bought at the supermarket. He started pouring oil into the middle of his palms. He ran his palms through his eyes and felt the warm oil flow down his back. He ran his hands through his hair, rubbed his hands together and then slid them across his chest. He worked his hands in a line along each side of his chest. Then he reached inside his shirt and pulled on a nipple, hard. At the same time he rubbed the oil over the inside of his waist. He squeezed the skin around his hip. Then he slipped his right hand outside of his underwear, pushing hard against it. He couldn’t believe how far he’d gone. He hadn’t realized how much there was to do. He looked down at the muscles of his hips and up to his face.</p> <p>“You know, I could probably do that all night long if I wanted just for a little,” he whispered. His eyes trailed down to his hands. “But I’ve got a better idea. So take a deep breath.”</p> <p>“This thing isn’t supposed to be uncomfortable,” the woman whispered.</p> <p>“I know, but take a sip of your drink.”</p> <p>“Of course I can’t get any better than I already am,” she said and leaned over to place her glass on the table. She held the bottle out to him and he drank the entire contents. He felt a slight twinge in his chest from having such a wonderful gift for himself.</p> <p>“Would you like a drink?”</p> <p>He opened his eyes and smiled at her. “Certainly,” he answered. Taking the bottle from her he poured the olive oil onto his palms. He poured a little more into his palms and rubbed some on his arms and shoulders. He then leaned down and pressed his lips against hers. The kiss was passionate and deep. He tasted the peppermint of her tongue and the sweet tang of her body. She moaned and held him in her embrace. He slid his arms under hers and brought his hands to the small of her back. He felt her hand rest on his, his fingertips running over her spine.</p> <p>“I think, if we start out the evening wrong, I might as well start with my lips and my mouth.”</p> <p>NEXT: Did the man kiss her again?!</p> <p>After her first kiss, Aidan stood up and helped her to her feet.</p> <p>“How about we go back up,” he whispered. “There’s still plenty of room for the two of us in this seat.”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
