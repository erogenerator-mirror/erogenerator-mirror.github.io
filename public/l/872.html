I wished to leave immediately after the funeral, but Georgiana entreated</strong> to come to this visit with me.</p> <p>This is how I met Georgiana. Her name was Georgiana, and she was a student at a private school. Georgiana and her family took me to the school where she graduated from and we were to meet there.</p> <p>I was in my final year teaching in the school, and I had to leave for the summer to fly my plane from London to the States. Georgiana, with her family being too busy for her to enjoy her vacation, offered to stay with me during the summer to help me out. We agreed that once I had left for the winter, she could rent a room at a posh apartment in the town I worked at. So I enrolled her in the university, a town known as the City of London right after my mother had left London for England. We arrived just after my summer started when everything became normal. Georgiana had been helping the university to improve its student body by getting the students a full scholarship for at least three years, and we could easily buy her a home of our own. However if someone was to ask me her age, I would find the most correct answer for her would be to “be my slave”.</p> <p>Georgiana was not only a beautiful person, she possessed a certain sensuality that suited her to a very special sort of fun. I had always noticed how her personality seemed to sparkle as she walked into the classroom. She had short, curly blonde hair that was pulled into an adorable bun on the back of her head and she wore the school uniform of a French maid on her head, but the look in her eyes made me melt. She was so pretty that I could not wait to get rid of my long hair so that I could wear the uniform myself.</p> <p>Georgiana was a perfect student. Her grades were as good as her English class, which she had won through the entire year of English Literature. The students of the school came from her own very beautiful family, which seemed perfectly suited to her beauty. They all seemed extremely intelligent and well educated, and they all had a great sense of humor which made her a perfect fit to the position, if not the position of my first submissive.</p> <p>One evening, when everyone was finishing dinner of a delicious meal we were going to share our first night of freedom together.</p> <p>Georgie is the one of my most favorite subs. Every night she would be the submissive to the master. She had been with another man for just over a year and still had the ability to suck cock and fuck men to his satisfaction with little or nothing to excite him. She was also extremely shy during sex, and could not cum with her pussy. Her fear and inhibitions had always driven her to do things that could jeopardize my career and the course of her schoolwork. When I was training her, I made her perform various sexual positions. I knew that there were other girls who would be willing enough to give pleasure to my girlfriend that I would get a freebie to do all of them, but it was much harder. Georgiana did every day what she was told. She loved to be my submissive, and I could treat her as anything other than my student. She loved to suck cock and lick pussy, and was willing to be my bitch to any order given by anyone else. We often ended up fucking all of us from 7-to-five on a single day, and I would make her kneel before me, naked except for her maid uniform of a long black maid skirt that covered her every important detail. I liked to tease her as much as she wanted to tease me, but I always let her go. When she was ready to stop her attempts at teasing me, I would let her kneel so that I could enter me, and my cock would slip into her. We would then take her to our room in the town of the town I used for my schoolwork and then she would give me her blowjob from within. Sometimes there were several people who knew us at that time. One of the people was a tall, skinny and balding man named Charles. He came over to our dorm room late one night and asked Georgiana to sit on his lap and suck his cock. When she got down to her knees and sucked him to an orgasm, he removed his cock from her mouth and made her kneel in front of him and suck him hard again. This would allow the others around a much closer vantage point for all of her sexual pleasure.</p> <p>This lifestyle was something Georgiana never understood, and I never wanted to tell her one day. Her sexual passion in her mind and body was not just mine. I could not stand to see her so used. I made her wear different clothes with a mask of sorts of things she could not see or even a lot of them. We would talk about her everyday, but we never talked about her life to each other than we both. We could tell—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
