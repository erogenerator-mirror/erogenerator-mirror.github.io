In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without</h4><p><strong>wavering in those things, which after a due examination and deliberation, he had determined. How free from all vanity he carried himself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they</strong> should be).</p> <p>He was also getting some very interesting news – this would not be a great first, he supposed. He'd never done this before, but she wanted more – she hadn't had much time and courage to take it further. (She and most of the other female students were still in denial about her relationship with the young man, of course – there's nothing wrong with enjoying the attention of an older woman.) He smiled and said: "If you could only promise me your willingness before now, I would do it." He wasn't going to turn around any time soon, or anyone, for that matter. He would tell her what he was offering and give her more, if that was the price of it.</p> <p>Then he thought a lot about it and decided it must be time to get into the mood to do it, right there in the middle of the reception hall, on this rainy day, and she would have to get him into bed quickly or risk giving herself to a rapist – the thought made him smile, and he began to wonder if maybe she felt some guilt – maybe he would have to do something.</p> <p>But time was slipping away from them, he decided. What did she want, he wondered. All he wanted to do was to be inside her, to touch all around her sex and body for the thousandth time. His fingers were already on her inner thighs – there was no resistance, and he could smell the sexiness of her - and he could taste the aroma of that arousal there. He wondered, what did she want him to do to her that it would be like this. If he brought himself up to speed, if he could do something about making her cum with that tongue, then there was no point denying it now. He began to slowly pull upwards. As he drew back, he could see the glistening opening, glistening with her wetness. He wondered if she really was as wet as he had thought she might be earlier. He looked down at her, and decided that a nice little cuntlicking was the only thing he would be able to do to her, to please her, which would be a very different thing to do if he was the one who'd caused it. She was already breathing more heavily, he decided; if she said there was something else, we may as well enjoy it together.</p> <p>Still teasing her, he began to push his tongue upward towards her clitoris, feeling it pressing against his tongue with a slight squirm. He found the tip of it hard and hot and wet, and started to slowly massage it, which had a wonderful effect on her: she began to moan very softly.</p> <p>"Yes! Yes!" she moaned. "Eat me!"</p> <p>He began to tongue her more aggressively, and found she was already enjoying it, at least as much as he was.</p> <p>"Come in my mouth!" she said.</p> <p>"Come in my mouth"</p> <p>She had another orgasm, she really liked it.</p> <p>He looked at himself in the large mirror as he brought himself to his knees, and then he leaned over her, slowly and deeply, so that the tip of his cock was almost brushing up against her mouth. It looked so good to him. She was already wet and ready for it, his cock was going to be just fine. She was looking at him as he held herself on one knee, and her hand was still stroking him as they kissed, the other on his backside, pulling him in. It felt good.</p> <p>Finally, she came out of her climax, her hips bucking against his, so that her eyes almost rolled back.</p> <p>"God – you feel so good, darling!" she moaned. "I can't believe that this is what I wanted, you know, but here we are, and you're going to have to come in my mouth, for me."</p> <p>That didn't surprise him – she had done this before, when he hadn't brought himself to her. She didn't know how she should get it into her mouth, but she did want him in it, and that meant he had to come inside her. So he drew himself down her body until his cock was almost the same distance as her cunt, and then he looked in the mirror at the sight that confronted him. She wanted this, she wanted that, too, but it would just have to wait. He reached down a grabbed his cock and positioned himself between her legs, a bit more on each side of the head.</p> <p>"Oh – I'm so hot for you," she said, "Please fuck me now!"</p> <p>She pushed herself against him, and his cock plunged into her, going as deep into her as it had gone down over the top of those previous times, so that he didn't even have any more than seemed to her clench of it. He thought it felt better, he'd taken her cunt already been, more—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
