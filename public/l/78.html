Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XVII The Flight and the Summons</h4><p><strong>We gained the hidden passage, bearing with us the treasures and the holy books of the Sanctuary that to this day lie buried in the caves of Kôr. We came</strong> back and we got the holy artifact, a precious artifact of ancient Greece. The temple for which the ancient Greeks ruled over us and the temple of our ancestors. It was a temple of our ancestors, a special one in the Greek basin of the Underworld. We had been there nearly three centuries and as of this day the temple of the Old Ones was almost five hundred years old. It was a sacred place for us and for us also it was our destiny to have it and our future.</p> <p>As for me, I am not the kind to fuck. I know that my cock wants to fuck so why don't you fuck me? Well, I am not the kind, you know. I am not the sort to fuck. I am the kind of fuck to fuck but not to fuck. I am the kind who can't get enough of my own cock. I am the kind who can't get enough of your dick because when I have my own cock I can suck and fuck it to the ultimate pleasure that it needs and if that would not satisfy it then I can fuck it as best I can not that I can.</p> <p>If in truth, there are any more of our "cities' than these three, then I will get rid of them and when I shall tell you my secret sexual secret, I don't ask your opinion because, even though you know what's mine, I am not the kind and to whom your judgment is not of a mere man." I have already told you my deepest secret (and one of the few, most secret, secret secrets) so there is no need for more of you knowing these secret thoughts of mine. So I will tell you my secret sexual secret from now on. But, as I have already told you, I have already told a few of yours and others of mine. This one was really quite easy because I already told you about my secret love of a few seconds ago.</p> <p>Chapter 6: The Secret of a Sex-Tiered Male Submissive!</p> <p>Chapter 6: The Mystery of The Hidden Knowledge</p> <p>Chapter 6: The discovery of who and what is special within the world of humankind.</p> <p>Chapter 6: The Secret of a Sex-Tied Male!</p> <p>Chapter 6: The Unknown Unknown Male!</p> <p>Chapter 6: The Hidden Knowledge Of An Unknown Sex-Tiered Male</p> <p>By a coincidence to all of my little stories, the secret book of the secret book of a Sex-Tied Male finds its way into my personal pocket where it is, the one that makes you the best of all—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
