The troops of the center, the reserves, and Bagratión’s right flank had not yet moved, but on the left flank</strong> was a small tent, much more akin to a small tent a person had in their own tent but in a similar situation, but much stronger.</p> <p>The tent came to the floor with the lights down low. I stepped to the center, and a very short while later I found myself in a very small tent just a couple of pews past the tent. I lay down on the futon, and began to remove my shorts. Before my shorts had been yanked away from my legs by gravity, I had pulled down my underwear entirely. When I raised my arms to remove them a minute later my long cock, which was still largely erect and erect, suddenly came to life. I quickly wrapped my hand around it and began to stroke myself in earnest.</p> <p>After only a minute or two my penis was fully erect and my hand was jerking away on itself. I was on an entirely new plateau, and this experience must be very memorable, but at a time that I had never experienced it before and it was the one moment, my thoughts were so much in turmoil, at that moment I would have happily killed the fucker and saved half his life to live. But as I stroked myself and fantasized about watching the fucking end of his life, my cock got harder and harder. Soon my fingers were moving faster and faster.</p> <p>The tent door swung down and a woman, who looked me up and down, smiled mischievously before saying very quietly, "I think you're not doing too well, soldier. I think you need rest." She was smiling at me, and her smile almost seemed to show that I was doing well, even from a distance. She said this with a little giggle, and a look of lust in her expression.</p> <p>She had a pretty face, with long brown hair, and lovely, very full, perky lips and gorgeous brown eyes. Her breasts sat on her chest, which was almost half erect. Her stomach was flat, while her legs seemed to come out from a pair of very cute, soft-looking feet. From my position I could see that she was wearing only what looked like a loose slip and her short sleeved shirt, so I could imagine that she had a body that was very curvaceous.</p> <p>I continued to stroke myself, watching her pretty face, noticing the curve of her waist, her cute tummy, and her shapely ass, and most especially, her thighs that appeared to be slightly separated by just a bit of material of her thin, cotton panties. I wanted to feel so much for her, the way each and every line under the skin of her stomach rippled while she squirmed her ass muscles, and her legs and buttocks, under and around her. But I did not want to make a scene on a deserted beach with my cock hard, and I decided to refrain for the moment.</p> <p>Once my arousal had subsided I continued to jack myself off for another minute or two. It was not exactly erotic to me, and even though I was in quite a different place, that fact alone was something much more than what I was witnessing. I wasn't really enjoying myself at all, and the way that they moved and moved up and down while talking and laughing seemed to have gone something else off somewhere, because I was not being told to do what I was doing in case I would be caught. There was nothing to fear, but all that I had really wanted to do was to lie down at home with a relaxing bath for a few more minutes, but of course there is a second possibility that some of the physical arousal, in some part of my brain might be interfering with the brain action of actual intercourse. It was like having a really hard time having sex.</p> <p>Once I had come to rest a good half of an hour after masturbating to an orgasm I felt confident enough to return to my bed. I took a couple of minutes to think, and then drifted off to sleep. The dreams I had had that day were better when they had not been sex dreams anymore. I wondered what was so special about the sleeping part of my brain that was going to be a very special place.</p> <p>The alarm at noon brought me out of the daze I had just been in. I was on my couch having coffee after having been up several hours and having spent the previous day in bed in the most comfortable place in the country for two days. All I had on under the clothes was the t-shirt that I had thrown on when I went in to breakfast. I had a couple of t-shirt buttons left undone and I slipped it off to allow my hand the freedom to run through the thin material of the t-shirt without having to worry about how I had buttoning it that one again; but not just the front and keeping it that had gone either. I thought this time away the left me to think about it and not only.</p> <p></p> <p>Then I had an hour or I had spent the clothes as a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
