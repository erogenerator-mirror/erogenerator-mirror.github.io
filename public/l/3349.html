Death on the Moor</h4><p><strong>For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight of responsibility</strong> lifted me from my place.</p> <p>I looked at her, her eyes searching mine, "Why aren't you in the bathroom, Mom..." I muttered, barely able to muster the force in my voice, "I have to take a piss."</p> <p>Her eyes flicking to me, an unreadable expression on her face, "That was a lot of fun, wasn't it?" she said.</p> <p>I couldn't help but agree, "Yes. We definitely did."</p> <p>For a second she just stood there staring at me, then, she turned and took my hand, taking me through the dark corridors at school. We paused at a school that looked very much like our own, while I tried my best to keep up, I must have looked like a deer caught in headlights, trying to catch sight of a passing car. But it wasn't to be, and when we got to Mr. Martin the bell guy gave us a nice smile, "Oh, I see you two get along just fine," he said, giving us a wink.</p> <p>"He's cute," I agreed, "And we're good, Mom, really," I said before I fell in step of her body.</p> <p>She was about to say something else when she smiled, "And that's exactly what got me into trouble this morning."</p> <p>I couldn't help but chuckle, a little surprised, "A lot of people get into trouble," she whispered, leaning up against me, "Maybe for me," she said, grinning as we walked to the bathroom.</p> <p>"You okay?" she said as we sat in the shower stall.</p> <p>"You sure?" she looked at me, "Do you mind getting out of here?"</p> <p>She grinned, "Don't be a smartass, I'll get you out if you don't get out of here," she whispered.</p> <p>"I think I'm still in shock," I said, standing up, "And you know what?" she said.</p> <p>"So who'd you have sex with, exactly?" she asked, holding my eyes.</p> <p>"Um, not yet," I said, looking at her, "Maybe later."</p> <p>"No," she smiled, taking my wrists in her hands, "I'm just so horny, I want you so bad I can't stand it."</p> <p>With that her body lowered onto mine, grinding her crotch into mine, kissing me with the most passionate of kisses that ever I could think of.</p> <p>I was surprised by how passionately and how quickly our lips started sliding along the other, the feel of our bodies pressed together was intoxicating. Our mouths opened and our tongues probed against one another, while she stroked my hairless chest, her hands working their magic on my back. Our lips never broke contact, our breath always becoming a little heavier, while she whispered how much she was looking forward to sucking on my dick. To make me happy she reached down and took my cock in her hand, pulling it up between us, before sucking down the length of it, her tongue working feverishly over the head of my penis.</p> <p>I moaned, my fingers playing with her breasts, "You're so beautiful, Mom," she moaned, "Mmmm," her mouth never left mine as she sucked, her hand stroked up and down my cock shaft. I had to bite my bottom lip to stop myself from cumming just then, but her other hand gently stroked over my chest, moving up my body to squeeze my nipples.</p> <p>I couldn't take my eyes off of her, she was so beautiful, her soft brown eyes staring up at me, with the lusty look she'd gotten when she first got to me, with those dark eyes burning into me, "Oh my God," I moaned, "You're so beautiful," I exclaimed.</p> <p>She slid down my body leaving a trail of drool on my skin as she went, leaving a trail of hot kisses down my chest and belly button. Reaching my dick she kissed my balls before wrapping her lips around the head, sucking around it. "What is it?" I asked, still staring into her eyes.</p> <p>She opened her mouth wide, taking the whole of my dick into her mouth, as her hand continued to jerk my dick. Her tongue flicked over every bit of the cock and her lips moved up and down the length of my shaft, while her hand jerked my cock.</p> <p>I felt my body react to her sucking, my hips pressing into her as my body jerked. Her tongue rolled over her head faster across the entire length of my cock as her mouth slid along my shaft, my swollen member. She wrapped around the head of my cock head of my shaft, her hand, never wanting to my cock sliding it like a little hand, as my hand and then. as I squeezed her head, feeling my hands were my fingers, my shaftâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
