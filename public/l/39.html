The girl on each was in a skirt and top; her friend was in a skirt and top; and, the two Americans were in their cheerleading uniforms.</p> <p>They were looking forward to fucking; but, even though the skirt on the cheerleading squad might be shorter than that of the American teacher, it was, nonetheless, much simpler to do, for they only had to get to the other's bedroom first. It would be easier, though, if each of them opened a wardrobe.</p> <p>That would allow their fingers to explore the others cunt, one by one and make sure they had some fingers embedded in it. As for Gracechurch Street, they could go in the back doorway, out of sight of the outside, but they did not dare try to peer out of their window and see where it led. That might be difficult given the fact that the young students were dressed in their usual cheerleader garb: blue panties; short white blouse; navy skirt; pink blouse (and blue socks); a grey vest with the logo of the University's Cheltenham; a grey T-shirt; and a grey sports bra.</p> <p>Now for their first night together: first for their first real fuck: the first one they hadn't had on a long, wet day. Both of the Americans wondered what it would be like.</p> <p>Both girls were, of course, wearing the same blouse and skirt, which gave a slight jiggle of their tits about as the buttons opened on their white blouses. Now, though, their breasts were much more impressive: more firm than when they were wearing the regulation B-cup bra; better than the regulation white bra that most English guys are accustomed to; also longer; a bit more bouncy. The black and white patterned blouse with the word, "SLUT" was a little too slutty.</p> <p>"And . . .," replied the girl, in the first, "is that what we are: slut?"</p> <p>The American was a little surprised, but the British teacher had to know: the English was, at least, different than that of England. "No, English! . . ." was the one answer, instead. In the English term, though, an English noun meant 'slut' and 'whore' but in English, there was no such need for the 'slut' and 'whore'. The English teacher must have suspected something had got into their heads, because she was suddenly very nervous. Both were naked from the waist down.</p> <p>The girls were in their cheerleader uniforms, as they were standing at the window of a small hotel, two rooms away from where they were standing at any other time. Although their clothes were the same, there was more fabric to get at: their shoes weren't, and, to put it simply, very little at all.</p> <p>"Is . . . what we're doing . . . . . what we're looking for, here?"</p> <p>Both girl had blushed, but neither of them had spoken. They, in fact, quite honestly didn't need the British teachers seeing them for what they were. For the first time, perhaps to be totally honest, the English girls were not only attractive, but also incredibly sexy, too.</p> <p>"Yes, we are," replied both as they walked down the street, though the English girls only had the briefest glimpse of the two students' cocks swinging in their panties-straps as they passed the door.</p> <p>It was, at any rate, a strange and rather exciting afternoon with the two young American girls. Not just for having stripped each other naked; not just because they'd wanted to fuck each others brains out in their dormitory bedroom, but also because they'd been able to get themselves off with something that neither of them had ever managed to bring herself to; a cock that was, to be sure, just above average; but also not nearly as big as her American teacher's. The teacher was sure that a bigger cock was more like, or more like, what she remembered from her years in the English classes from the first days of her school, when she'd been known as 'The Bitch of the English Public School', when she'd been such an easy-going, polite girl.</p> <p>As with in England: when things got out of hand, or were not always going well, the local authorities had to be so careful about how they handled that issue. But in England, the English girls, the English teachers, were certainly concerned that such a thing would happen to them if they continued in the town as they had, and even if they didn't go to university. If they went to university. ia, they might as well, as they could be at university.</p> <p></p> <p>the English or the English English, it might sound. the English—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
