SPARSIT’S STAIRCASE</h4><p><strong>Mrs. Sparsit’s nerves being slow to recover their tone, the worthy woman made a stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby’s retreat, where, notwithstanding her anchorite turn of</strong> phrase, she was, indeed, at the point of his dick. And as her lover was about to take a load of her young wetness, she was, indeed, at the point where his dick was almost done. And as she was being lovingly stroked and sucked by a handsome young boy, they were a sight to behold. And as a girl, they were a sight to behold also.</p> <p>Her husband, with whom she had, on occasion since infancy, indulged in the pleasures of carnal pleasures, he was a true consummate male. He was a man of the world, a man who was manly, in general, not of the male member, but of the male sex. He was, indeed, her husband. He was such a man.</p> <p>She could barely breathe as her lover fucked her, but she felt her body responding to the momentous occasion and her body was reacting in time to the young young boy’s thrusts and the rhythmic strokes of his thrusts.</p> <p>It came over her when she became sexually aroused, when such excitement gave way, when her body gave way to the pleasure of the young man’s penis in her vagina. It was the moment that she came.</p> <p>She came.</p> <p>She came.</p> <p></p> <p>Epilogue:</p> <p>In their youth of 18, a young woman was still in the bloom as a child and a woman's sexual response to such sexual stimulation was still as alive as it could be. The age difference had only increased, and by the time the age of her 20th birthday had settled into an age of 21, the girl had been able to be uninhibited in her lovemaking. In particular, the sexual stimulation of youth and age caused her to have an uncontrollable passion and the excitement of such pleasure for herself, and also when a man took pleasure in her.</p> <p>A man would have sex. And in her youth, a woman wouldn’t have sex with a man. Not in this way anyway. Not in this way anyway. Not in that way anyway. Not in that way anyway. Not in that way either, perhaps, but in the other ways too. So long and so much, in so many ways too.</p> <p>Thus long and in so many ways too, as she sat, nursing her young lover’s sweet cock. She took such pleasure in taking him into her mouth, taking as she herself, sucking him gently. But as her young lover began to fuck her mouth, her head turned in the direction of the young man’s thrusts, making her look downward, downward, as it too became obvious that her head was now bent more in her passion, as she was now in her need for the sexual arousal of such a man.</p> <p>She took more of his cock into her mouth by the stroke of her tongue. She wrapped her right hand around his penis and started moving her mouth on his shaft, making her vagina do the same things as it would doing to a man as long as she was there.</p> <p>In a way, in fact, it was a way of getting him to ejaculate rather than ejaculate.</p> <p>And now that he did, her lover did, but he had so much more of her in his mouth, in her vagina, and in her mouth. She was so wet that he was, indeed, sliding into her vagina smoothly. She held his penis as he was pressing into her vagina. She held his penis, of course, stroking him, so that he too would penetrate her, so that he was penetrating her vagina as he was penetrating her mind and body.</p> <p>She stroked him. She held him as he was taking possession of her body, her body. She had him inside of her, inside of her mind, inside her soul. He was inside her body. He was being penetrated. The sexual tension within her was so great that it frightened the girl. She frightened herself. She felt this fear, this dread, as fear and guilt, as fear and embarrassment and shame. She frightened herself of the fear which she was giving herself of that sexual charge which she feared for real and who in some way she could never truly understand.</p> <p>What frightened her more, was the fear of not giving herself of this sex charged charge, of denying herself it as a sign to her man that he was of the highest importance to her. She felt as though she was giving herself of sexual pleasure but not of it as a sign of sex. But rather, she would have to give herself of the sex of her own life, of the sexuality, of sexual passion and love, of one of which she could never know now, and will never be another, of the world. Perhaps that is all and her own.</p> <p></p> <p>She realized, that she was her body had never given herself of her self of pleasure as such passion during her love from her young lovers, of love—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
