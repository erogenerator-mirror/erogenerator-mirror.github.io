It appeared</strong> to me he was just a man with access to the land through a small handrail. I was in charge; if it was necessary to fuck him I would follow. A quick examination revealed my true occupation. My cunt was still slightly raw from the beating in the back of the head. I had been through the whole of the evening without any cum in me; but now, after the vigorous fucking which took half an hour I was ready for more.</p> <p>Mr. Pumblechook was sitting on a raised platform, his eyes shut and his cock up and ready. I felt the wetness of my knickers and his hand stroking my thigh. As if to see what my cunt would do, I ran my fingers over my inner thighs and over my cunt lips. They were still swollen. Mr Pumblechook knew what his customer liked but his finger seemed to know that the price for doing so was that he had to do it. He was pleased with the way I felt while being satisfied; but now something else was a bit more intense than I would have preferred to know.</p> <p>The man in the train carriage, the one who had just been sucked, and I fucked myself as he fucked the customer, the one who was taking a long lunch in the town hall area. The feeling of both men's bodies on my thighs aroused me so and I enjoyed it so. I felt my pussy gush down my thighs as I came; my nipples became hard again and I felt my orgasm run through me.</p> <p>As the train pulled into the market area Mr Pumblechook stepped away from the seat, his cock waving about half way up his thigh. His hand went down to his cock and fondled his balls as he walked around the carriage to his seat.</p> <p>"Thank you, sir," he said.</p> <p>"I have a lot of work to do" I added.</p> <p>Mr Pumblechook sat down; he looked relieved to see me. I felt a bit embarrassed walking around the carriage where he had already entered the market and entered the market; but was soon to take his position near his position on the train. I stepped forward to sit astride the carriage's lower half. The hand on my thigh moved up to my inner and began to stroke my clit. I was wet. I lifted my cunt to my Master's cock and felt it at the lips of my cunt. He pushed through and I was able to take the entire length of him in one shove. I could feel it being squeezed by my muscles as he went deep. I felt that I would come and came again and again and again, and I couldn't care less whether I did.</p> <p>He moved my head to my mouth and we kissed for a long time. I wanted to taste his body but he was kissing me very passionately and I was not used to kissing and fucking other men. He pushed my head back and my tongue began to tease his cock again. It was not long before he moved me down towards the seats opposite the train. We kissed again and his tongue entered my mouth. The other men in the carriage were watching.</p> <p>At my urging he had my skirt raised. My naked cunt had opened itself to him and he saw everything. I felt his cock against the lips of my vagina. I was afraid it wasn't going to fit and I felt it pushing against me. He pushed himself against my vulva and I felt every inch of his manhood as my pussy muscles squeezed him.</p> <p>He pushed more of himself into me and I found myself wishing he could go on forever.</p> <p>After an interval there was an intercom buzz. A man from the back of the carriage came on and asked, "Mr. Pumblechuck, do you think you can get a better rate on the money?"</p> <p>"I'd like to" I replied.</p> <p>He came to where I was leaning on the seat. He unfastened the cord on the shirt collar. I felt the cool evening air on the bare flesh of my breasts, and then he took both breasts in his hands. I felt his fingers at my nipples and began to rock my body on his cock, which was now hardening and ready for more action. He took them in his hands and bent and kissed my breasts and then my tummy and I felt his tongue between my legs. It was just long enough for me to feel him at my clitoris with a finger. The other men in the carriage where there looked as well as me, but the one on the back was obviously interested in his work.</p> <p>"I'd have my back to the train so far I could come in the seat," I thought and laughed my self. My pussy was hot, wet, I was desperate and I was glad, he was enjoying it. I was desperate to be fucked at his pleasure.</p> <p></p> <p>This was the signal crack of course, the whole country's first day was the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
