His face clouded over when I showed him the empty</strong> seat before I slid into it. Once we started the highway he was gone, though we could hear it in his voice:</p> <p>"It might be possible for you to fuck with the best in society, but don't worry!"</p> <p>I was about to add to his self-assurance when my face flamed.</p> <p>"It's hard for you to be here. I'm not saying you don't have a chance."</p> <p>His gaze followed mine, and I felt the warmth spread through me. My face didn't flop over like it usually did. I smiled, and we continued driving into town on another state highway. The driver got turned down the first mile.</p> <p>The driver looked over at me, smirking, and then asked:</p> <p>""How are your knees and your pussy?"</p> <p>I laughed: "I had these on the highway for one of my dates, and I had to have a few drinks. I need more than that tonight."</p> <p>The driver nodded as he pulled up next to me. He looked back at the highway, grinned and pulled out his phone, turning it on before putting the device in his pocket and looking around the car for instructions.</p> <p>"You know, this is a pretty wild car, isn't it?" he asked.</p> <p>Before I could reply, he looked over at me, smiled, and said: "I'll take that as a compliment."</p> <p>I smiled back at him, and said:</p> <p>"Yeah, it's pretty wild."</p> <p>He grinned, and said:</p> <p>"There's something going on. You know that I'm thinking about your pussy though, right?"</p> <p>It was a statement, an observation, and all, but my pussy twitched as I said it to him. It wasn't my pussy that was getting wet at the thought. It was the thought that my cunt was thinking too, and that would make it very wet. It didn't stop me from imagining that at one point it would have been just about my pussy, but instead it was more like a wet spot as his words rolled into my head.</p> <p>My face flamed, and my hands began trembling as the thought passed through me. His eyes rolled back a bit, and he murmured:</p> <p>"I don't want to know. I want to know that it is going to be a hard fuck, isn't it?"</p> <p>The thought didn't take much, but before I could say anything else, the engine was running, and now I was really nervous about how I would respond to him. It was probably safe to be in that seat with him: we'd need to put off driving and getting off for a bit.</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I felt his hand rest on the small of my back. He smiled softly as he pulled me toward him. We'd talked before, and I hadn't let on that he had thoughts of getting me to go through with the first time. I knew how shy I'd been, but still wasn't sure what any of his feelings were.</p> <p>Finally, without saying a word, he leaned over and nuzzled my neck, before pushing me onto the seat, and then lifting over to kiss me, and then leaning down once more to take her nipple from it. As soon as he had sucked it, I couldn't hold off any longer, and threw my head back and moaned.</p> <p>His hands cupped my breasts, and his lips sucked them. His finger probed my cunt for a moment, and then dipped it in. He was still just above me, but I was starting to feel weak. I pushed up against his hands, and he took them off me.</p> <p>I wasn't sure what that meant, but he looked surprised:</p> <p>"I have a very good idea," he said. "But I need to know what is going on, so I wouldn't feel obligated."</p> <p>I didn't know what he meant by that, but I reached down for him, grasped his cock tightly as his fingers began to rub my wet lips through my juices. If he wanted to fuck me before we got to the road, he certainly wasn't going to miss that opportunity.</p> <p>He pulled me close, slid his fingers in between my ass cheeks, and felt my wet cunt:</p> <p>"You're ready for sex," he said softly.</p> <p>"I am," I said, "please don't stop!"</p> <p>I felt him chuckle before he put his lips over mine again. He kissed me hard, and then pulled away, then pushed me backward onto the seat. He lay down on top of me, and began kissing me again. This time, when he kissed me, his mouth was hot and we were both hungry and demanding. We both knew that we wanted it was a taste for the other. Our first taste of the other. Ours.
