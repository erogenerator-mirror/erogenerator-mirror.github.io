His shoes were of a different kind. They reminded Marius of a worn-out old pair of faded-pajama pants.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is nice. Nice...nice."</p> <p>Marius walked, as best he could, to the door of his apartment. The cold winter day outside was quite warm. The temperature was quickly descending upon his apartment. Marius entered the bedroom. It was quite warm: the warmth of the summer was wearing off and the cold air outside was a perfect backdrop to Marius. He walked up to his closet. The inside of his closet contained a variety of sexy clothing, from sexy to sexy. He pulled out a pair of pink high-heeled shoes that were black with a pink heel. He placed them on his bare feet. One pair looked especially stunning on his feet. He put on the other shiny pair. It fit perfectly. He selected another pair and waited for it to arrive.</p> <p>When he returned to the living room his wife, Annabelle, was already there. She sat in the sofa chair, in her usual place of the chair. The chair was an expensive black leather chair; it looked like an antique. He took a seat at the end of the sofa and began to read. He flipped through the pages of the pages of the book. It was as the days of reading started. It was as the days of reading became the days of watching television. It was as the days of drinking the orange juice of a diet of a certain variety of food became as the days of being bored became the days of being alive. Marius started to read the book at a different tempo.</p> <p>Annabelle had a certain habit of talking about her sex life. The topic was always topic. She preferred describing sex in a way that it wasn't the subject for discussion. She also never looked directly at Marius, who stood there with an erection. She spoke about the variety of sexual positions, which she had enjoyed with men. As Marius stood, his erection became quite prominent. He was a little embarrassed by it. He wasn't exactly embarrassed by it.</p> <p>The way that the topic of sex was discussed was very interesting. Annabelle used more detail than Marius had ever expected to be able to do. And Annabelle got more and more explicit. She spoke about things from the day of the first sexual partner he had ever had, to the day of sex he wished he had the chance of having. She talked about the things that you might expect for your first sexual partner to say during sex in conversation. She talked about the things men would not normally do to a woman. She talked about the things he would do to a woman. And Annabelle, as beautiful as Annabelle was, always had a look of complete satisfaction. It was as she spoke that she got even more aroused, if that was ever possible. Marius' erect cock was obvious as soon as Annabelle told him that she had been feeling aroused. Annabelle didn't say anything to Marius. She didn't know what she had said at all. Was that a sign that she knew Marius well enough to know what she wanted him to do to her, or was it something else that she couldn't or wouldn't say no to? Either way, she thought, it was the best sign that Marius had ever achieved that she had hoped that he would not lose his erection so soon. Marius was the best sexual partner of her life.</p> <p>After a while, Marius' penis became a little stiff. He looked away from the book for a while. Annabelle took the initiative to talk about the sex that she had experienced with other men. She described how much joy that she felt when they had sex with other men. Then she pointed at Marius' erect penis. Marius' eyes immediately widened. His penis rose, standing straight up, pointing straight from his groin like its tail end.</p> <p>"I have never had sex like that." Annabelle thought in amazement. "It's so easy to do it."</p> <p>She asked Marius what he thought of the pleasure that he felt while having sex with other men. At that same moment, Marius' eyes started to get very, very big.</p> <p>"I've never had a penis that big." She said. "It's very good."</p> <p>She spoke with a softness that Marius found quite fascinating. It was a lot of pleasure. It meant so much to him to her. Yet, at least. It meant he really good.</p> <p>"It means a lot too, really. It means a lot. You're happy." A way to me." She said Marius. She said.
