Everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment; a thousand mysterious crashes in the air, the breath of</strong> Christ, and the roar of the dying church to all.</p> <p>The night wore on with the sound of my heart being so loud that it made the entire world stop. My entire life, I'd lived to fight and die to survive. I lived to sleep through the night knowing that I no longer had a life anymore.</p> <p>I'd gotten off in the middle of nowhere and never looked back.</p> <p>I remember the first thing I would do, that night when I'd left the hotel. I could still smell the alcohol when I left. I still feel the burn it put on me from where I lost my life, like the cold metal in my hand. I still feel the light touch of fear when I finally realized that death had never been my destiny. I had always felt fear and fear at that moment too. I was so far away from where I could even make sense of what happened.</p> <p>Instead, my life had all been sucked right down. I could see the look of regret on my dead friends face, and I was so afraid that it had never been my destiny. I knew for sure that that moment would never be my last.</p> <p>I was so sure that I could tell this now. I was almost sure that the memory of that memory kept popping up in my mind forever.</p> <p>So there was no point getting caught. Even if I was certain that my memories were accurate, in my mind they weren't. They weren't always the memory I'd been made to remember, they couldn't always be memories.</p> <p>I saw a shadow pass through my subconscious and the memory of the future finally came back. There was nothing left of my soul to tell at that point. Nothing but the reality of the moment.</p> <p>I was almost certain that it wasn't real. It was a dream. I was no longer alive. This moment would never be forgotten; that much was clear.</p> <p>I felt numb when I woke up, unable to make sense of my surroundings. The room inside my body was warm and comforting and comforting. As my senses were suddenly fully restored I started to feel a bit more awake. I was still in the hospital.</p> <p>I was still naked.</p> <p>I was still standing.</p> <p>The silence that I'd had the other night was gone. I was still there. I still felt alive.</p> <p>I still felt alive after my life was stolen. It was no better than that.</p> <p>I still didn't fully understand how I felt. The last memory I had of myself, well I didn't feel the sadness from the time that I was alive after my death and it was gone, because I'd come across my final thoughts just then. I felt the pain of betrayal and betrayal at that moment, and those feelings were very deep. But deep.</p> <p>Those feelings were like my mind was numb. I was cold. There wasn't any warmth inside me anymore. I didn't have a future and even if I did I certainly felt like a kid at that moment.</p> <p>"There was no way that he could still be my son" I thought. "I felt like some fucking kid in a horror flick. I couldn't believe that one look at him would be enough to know that he was the son of a fucking God." Then I realized what all the memories felt like and I was reminded of what that meant to me.</p> <p>I felt as sad as I'd ever felt in my life. I was so very lonely without my son.</p> <p>I remembered feeling so tired and miserable. I felt so empty; I felt like a fucking zombie. There was no comfort in feeling empty and alone.</p> <p>I felt like I'd just been picked up off a rock. I felt so exhausted I felt as if I'd just been drugged. I felt like I was just going to sleep. I felt as if I wanted to sleep forever.</p> <p>I felt so dirty and vulnerable and exposed, like I was too tired to even think about life anymore, and the fact that I didn't know if anyone knew my feelings had become meaningless in spite of my best efforts to make myself more presentable to the world was too much to comprehend.</p> <p>"That was so fucking shitty! I should've never had to even have to leave that fucking hospital" I thought to myself with relief. "It's amazing that there are still so many of these fucking people out there. I think that God would agree with me that death can be a lot of fun."</p> <p>Then, suddenly, the pain I'd lived through was so much worse and worse than either of that. I felt like I had become a homeless. I only an empty corpse. A zombie in the death. I was a homeless, no longer dead, the future I was a homeless homeless. A zombie. I was dead.</p> <p></p> <p>I don—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
