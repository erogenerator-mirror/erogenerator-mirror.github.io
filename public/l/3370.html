Now there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over the city</strong>. But then again, there's your old lady at the library and her little pouty pucker can be so beautiful.</p> <p>Ahem—that's pretty much the general consensus.</p> <p>"Come on, Sugar. Your little pucker is still pretty nice."</p> <p>Horny as a bitch in heat she couldn't help but stare at the large cock that was in her face inches from her lips.</p> <p>"That's so nice looking," she cooed as she took his cock in her mouth; it was so hard to even consider being tempted to touch herself.</p> <p>He leaned back in his chair feeling her lips sliding the length of his cock. He leaned back in his chair watching her work his hard-on; it was so fucking hot seeing his boss's slutty blonde-haired secretary blow him.</p> <p>"You know, I think I'd like to fuck you," he sighed his voice getting huskier.</p> <p>"Don't just fuck me, Sugar-pants. Come fuck me," she purred.</p> <p>He smiled thinking that that sounded really good but at the same time he hated the way she acted. She always acted so sweet, so polite, and so cocky. That's why he didn't want her anymore.</p> <p>A girl that could blow him like that should be his.</p> <p>Maybe I should take a hint.</p> <p>She was so cute and so fucking sexy that even a guy that turned on by her could turn on his lady-sluts.</p> <p>"Do it, Sugar-pants." he panted.</p> <p>"You think so, don't you?" she teased moving her tongue over the head of his cock.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" he cried.</p> <p>"Good." she said taking him out of her mouth making him groan and pull her to him.</p> <p>He felt her lips glide down his shaft.</p> <p>She was making love to his cock with her mouth.</p> <p>Fuck... she's a natural.</p> <p>He never dreamed about a blowjob but now every time he got one, it didn't matter.</p> <p>"Do it, Baby-Slut," he said looking into her eyes; looking deeply into her eyes.</p> <p>"That's it for all those times I didn't want to see you," he whispered to her.</p> <p>"That was a while ago. You'll have to learn to do it again."</p> <p>"I already took my panties off," he said rubbing her clit.</p> <p>"I'm not going to give up. Come fuck me right here."</p> <p>He felt her hot fingers moving on his shaft.</p> <p>"Come on fuck me, Sugar. I want to feel you inside me."</p> <p>"You better," she cooed moving her mouth away from his cock.</p> <p>The sex act would never be repeated.</p> <p>"Fuck me; I want you on top of me."</p> <p>"I'd love to take you to bed."</p> <p>"Okay, but I can't promise we'll be able to make love."</p> <p>"You can fuck me, and if you can't, we'll make love," he replied.</p> <p>"What do you say?"</p> <p>"I love it. Go ahead."</p> <p>He was nervous about what he would do with the next hour in one night.</p> <p>"Go first; I'm not sure how long it will take."</p> <p>She started taking his cock from her mouth; it felt so good to her. She took him back in her mouth but left him in her pussy.</p> <p>"Come on, Sugar-pants," he said pushing her on the chair.</p> <p>When she moved her head away from him a look of confusion flashed across her features.</p> <p>"What's wrong," she teased moving her mouth back.</p> <p>"I... I need to take it," he cried.</p> <p>"Are you sure," she asked looking into her eyes expecting him to get mad.</p> <p>"Are we going to do this again?" he said staring into her eyes.</p> <p>He didn't say anything but his tone made it hard for her to understand.</p> <p>"I guess not," she said looking away from him with her mouth.</p> <p>"Come on, Baby-Slut. I'm serious," he said pushing her towards the couch.</p> <p>"What about work tomorrow," she asked.</p> <p>"No, I'll work out there for the next week. I have to go back to see the team."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I'm going home." he said. Go on my desk tomorrow I'm busy." Friday to be there then, that will be at home," he added. You should, and be."</p> <p>. It may be." .</p> <p></p> <p>"I'm leaving on my desk.</p> <p>"I'll be."</p> <p>if he wanted—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
