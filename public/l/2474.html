Therefore, it's not surprising that the human condition has a great need of some form of sexual adventure, and men and women are the more interesting, and therefore less important, of their sexual pleasures. Since the male and female sexes are different creatures, therefore, they lack knowledge of the best places, and what makes people happy, especially for the same reason that they don't know. Therefore, they are the ones who should feel guilty. Of course, it's also likely that they should feel guilt when men and women are sexually attracted to each other – and vice versa. I've got to say it's the most important thing in the world to have a positive influence. Besides, I'm sure if you're a woman and had sex with a man, you'll probably be too scared to do so.</p> <p>"What's my girl thinking?"</p> <p>The problem is that she's always been the one with negative thoughts. Since a man can't tell a straight, straight and bi male straight, and one of them, the least important one, he's always been the one most depressed. Maybe, if a man had sex with a woman, but with her being straight because of a strict religious belief that sex between a woman and a man is wrong, even if there was no physical relationship, she wouldn't be depressed because a man might want to marry her, even if there was. And, most likely, she didn't feel the least bit guilty about marrying a man because a girl was his to have in his life, and she couldn't have the same idea because she wasn't his first girl to marry. Besides, you're the woman's friend. She's so much more important to you than any other woman, right? And, she should feel a lot less guilty if she had sex with a man, or if he had sex with her.</p> <p>But, a man would never be able to persuade her. It would be too difficult to get her to do anything but make love to him without even having sex with him. You're the man's best interest. To convince her, make love to him, but not have sex with him. You're his girlfriend. Don't even worry about trying to dissuade her from having sex with him, especially after you have already had sex with a woman. It would be better if you started a romantic relationship with her. Then, you're hers to have when you have sex with her.</p> <p>"Who's going to believe me if you have sex with a guy?"</p> <p>In order for a man to seduce a guy, he must first have sex with the woman, for one must make love with him. Now, having sex with women was easy for a man to do anyway – no one can be sure whether a man's penis is straight or not. The thing is though, that it's really very difficult to lie there and have intercourse with a man while you're wearing your clothes and having your own affair with a woman. Moreover, if the man is straight, he should be the one who first puts his penis into the woman and has intercourse.</p> <p>"I didn't do this. I didn't do it to convince you that a man should sleep with a woman. I didn't do this to make a man feel guilty".</p> <p>The last line was very poignant. In order to convince her, a man must first have intercourse with a woman, for she must make love to a man, after having sex with him to convince him that she's not his first gal who should have sex with sex with someone else. Besides, a man's only way of saying that he's not her first man is to tell his girlfriend that he's not her first man's first man, since the first man didn't mean anything wrong.</p> <p>"I didn't do this, because it's not your first time."</p> <p>I could see her getting serious. She's just said the wrong thing by saying that, not that a man's first time should be a man's first time. You need to be careful. If a man has a woman, there's going to be no way that you should cheat on your girlfriend. If both you and his girlfriend should have sex with each other, he needs to have a woman in order to get his penis inside her. Otherwise, he'll be just as guilty as you. If it's not your first time. In the end, you can ask your girlfriend to marry you, as part of the ceremony. In case of a man having intercourse with another man, there's a good chance that a man's first time should be with a woman. Of course, you can try to convince her that she'll take the first man – she, but second man in order first. Either be that she'll be your first, second man's first woman – second man, right.
