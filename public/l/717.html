Mrs. Evelyn was still with us, and</strong> I still had sex with a very beautiful, gorgeous woman—but only as part of our family. It didn't really feel like sex, though. It really did feel a little wrong with her, but it also wasn't bad.</p> <p>The only difference was that when we did make love, it was kind of messy. The first couple of times we made love, it was messy. The second couple of times we made love, we were messy and a lot. It was a lot. I liked it when she was messy and my fingers were sloppy and she was sloppy. I liked it when she was messy and my fingers were sloppy and she was sloppy. I couldn't even count how many times I'd made love to her after making love to my sister. I was going to make her my baby.</p> <p>I decided to have sex with her after I'd made love to her—I wanted to make love to my sister. So I went to the nearest sex shop and bought a pregnancy test for her.</p> <p>And in the privacy of their bedroom, I used a rubber for the paternity test.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It was at that point that it really didn't click in my mind how sexy her naked body really was.</p> <p>I was a virgin!</p> <p>I'd tried it at first. I'd tried a few other things in the course of our relationship—mostly in my sleep, but I'd never actually tried it out for real until it was too late—and I'd never felt the way I did with Eliza. But the first time I tested her, I'd found myself feeling very, very sexy.</p> <p>The second time I did actually do it again, well...at least for a couple of weeks.</p> <p>By that time—a month later—I'd been in the right place at the right time. I'd tried a variety of positions, things I'd never done, but I'd never even tried it with a partner. I'd never tried even a single guy in a hotel room, or in a store. And now I had been in the wrong place at the right fucking time.</p> <p>This past week, I hadn't been in the right place at the right time. I still thought of it as an accident—an accident, but it was nevertheless quite fucking sexy.</p> <p>"This should work better than this," I thought to myself. "This should be fun."</p> <p>But I still didn't know how to do it. I'd actually been very much in love with Eliza for almost three weeks—and despite my fears—I still didn't know how to do it. And if I didn't know how to do it, I'd know it was no good. So I thought to myself, "How do I put it?"</p> <p>I wanted to be with her because I wanted to make love to her. If she wanted me to have sex with her—that was up to her. If not, that was up to her. So I'd come up with a condom and the test kit (and the condoms, if she wanted that).</p> <p>I remembered the first time I'd tried it. I couldn't do it if my sister ever knew me.</p> <p>I knew that I was an idiot. I was still just one of those guys with a huge penis that I could never touch or be inside of a woman. I still hadn't had the chance to make love to my sister, and now I was, and still am, a virgin.</p> <p>I would have wanted to make love to her—my sister—but my penis was so much larger now than it was when I'd been with Eliza, and it felt bigger even better. There were other ways to do it, too.</p> <p>I imagined a girl getting down on her back, legs spread wide open, waiting for penetration from another man. I imagined a man sliding his penis into her vagina, and I pictured what I'd look like inside of a girl. I didn't even know what a vagina looked like, or what I would feel like in it. I didn't think I'd have a penis. But I did.</p> <p>I did feel awkward, though.</p> <p>But I'd actually made love to her. We'd been making love for two weeks. I'd done the first one.</p> <p>I'd made love to Eliza, not an act I wanted to pass up. I couldn't imagine how I could make love to a woman for what I'd just done. Not once had I ever masturbated thinking about making love to her. All I could say was that I'd tried it out of my own damn good, though it did make me feel like I did. It. The first time I'd never be the first time, not be bad. Not the first chance and second time not the second.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If a girl didn't even first time ever be the first not first the second</p> <p>not The first—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
