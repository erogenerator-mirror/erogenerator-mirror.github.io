He opened his eyes, watching his wife of twenty-six years stroke his face, feeling himself become more excited, and more relaxed.</p> <p>"It hurts," he said, and she put her hands out again, and he felt her hands on his face. He closed his eyes, and she rubbed him. She was kissing his cheek, then he opened his eyes. Her face was close to his mouth, and he closed his eyes again and kissed her, and that's when she did it.</p> <p>What? He said.</p> <p>What? She said it again. The feel of her mouth on his mouth was a new thing, and now she was slowly opening her lips, moving her tongue against his, moving him inside her mouth, all the way into her. Was he going to be able to feel her lips opening and closing around him and feeling his erection, or was this another of her tricks for taking his cock away from he mind?</p> <p>He was no longer surprised to feel her tongue against his lips, which were closing, holding him, and just touching him. He felt her tongue on his lips again, and she opened her lips even more, kissing the inside of his mouth, and he opened his mouth.</p> <p>She began to suck his lips, and he closed his lips, opened his mouth.</p> <p>She did it for a while, until she realized that she could still see the face of his wife against his lips, and she realized that she was going to be able to do that to him. She moved her mouth again between his lips, licking his lips and opening her mouth, taking him inside, and then she took his cock inside her mouth, all of it, all the way to the back of her throat. "Do you like that?" she laughed, and he just nodded. He really liked that, not in his own hands, but in his mouth, in his mouth. Her hands were on his head, and he could feel her fingers rubbing him. He could smell the fragrance of his wife's perfume, and feel it against his skin. His wife's fingers were in his hair, and he kept his head back, so he could not look in the face of her.</p> <p>She was still making him feel good, feeling him inside her mouth, and she kissed all over him, as she did at his house. She had taken a part of his cock inside her, but only the tip, but it felt great, like nothing his wife ever did. She kissed him again and again, feeling he felt her lips, and her tongue, working against his face as well. His wife had never had his penis in her mouth, and had never sucked him to completion before, and it felt great, too.</p> <p>She licked it, and he kept it like that for a long time—making it hard again, just to feel her mouth full of it—until she reached to his lips with her hand, and slowly she lifted, and let him feel that the tip of it. She touched it with her tongue and it felt fantastic. She was taking him in, and his wife had never let him feel anything like it. His cock felt different from now, but at the same time he felt sexy, and he said that he liked it. And he loved watching his wife's eyes as she sucked him.</p> <p>If anything, her mouth, and his cock felt more sexy, and him being a little shy about it all the time. He was so shy that he didn't know how he looked, if he looked shy, not his wife.</p> <p>He felt his wife slowly go down to the base of his cock and suck it to an erection. Then she got to her knees and opened her mouth, and he felt her warm tongue at the base of his cock, and he loved it.</p> <p>His wife had never sucked his cock, and she had never touched it to an erection, or done anything like that to it. She knew exactly what to do. Her tongue went right at the tip and slid on the bottom of it, and she was doing it in between her teeth, and her tongue was sliding and sliding over his head now, and all the while her cheeks and lips kept going all the way around it, and she did it all in the same motion, and all of it, and he felt like his whole body might collapse on its own accord, his wife touching it, feeling like she was touching him, even the very special, all.</p> <p></p> <p>and then she took his legs to the knees and he didn't let his dick be a hand hold his wife suck his erection and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
