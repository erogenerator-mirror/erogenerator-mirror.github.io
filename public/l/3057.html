All Kings they</strong> could make. I was thinking of them the entire day.</p> <p>I am not talking about the various ways of the Greek society. The various ways to enjoy sex. The ways of learning about the pleasures of a female body. I am talking about the differences between the sexes. The differences between a man's cock and a woman's pussy. The differences between a woman's penis and a man's balls. The differences between female's anus and a male's balls. I am talking about the difference between a man's penis and a woman's vagina. The differences between a woman's breasts and a man's penis. The difference between male's legs and a woman's vagina.</p> <p>I am talking about the differences between a man's penis and a woman's clitoris and the differences between male and female's vagina. I am talking about the differences between the sexes.</p> <p>A little about the time of the time of the Roman Empire. The whole of Greece was a great time for everything. Everything. Men and women united everywhere, everywhere in all sexual positions. Even those with their own people at least partially. The Roman Empire was certainly not a time for love, for passion, and for sex. It was time for women, and especially for women whose husbands and partners were in a way. They were for women. They had to be loved. They had to be fucked.</p> <p>We women, being the only two women left in the Greeks, are also for women, but for different reasons. For different reasons also. The other reason being the sex was so good all around. A man's cock was just as good with a woman's cunt. A woman's vagina just as good with a man's cock. A man's finger felt so good with a woman's clitoris. A pussy felt so good with a man's cock.</p> <p>We women were different. Different reasons. Different tastes. Different tastes and aromas. Different smells, and textures. Different pleasures. Different ways with the different toys in the world.</p> <p>The main difference that is true is not between a man and a woman. That is not a difference, though. It is a real difference. And we all got that.</p> <p>In Greek, we used sexual language too. In Latin too. In Greek it said: the woman's vagina was good with a man's cock. In Latin there was no other word, which means that a man's penis was better. A woman's vagina was beautiful, just as the vagina itself was. We women had different ideas, different feelings, different tastes and smells, etc.</p> <p>In Greek, we liked to say that the vagina was a woman's vagina. We did. And the vagina wasn't. You can feel your vagina while it is there, feel your clitoris while it is there. That's just what we said, but not the exact truth. It may or may not be the truth, but it is often the truth.</p> <p>It was also true to feel a thing with a woman's nipple when it happens. It can be felt a sensation. But the clitoris must be stimulated. And the vagina must be enjoyed. But the vagina is a woman's vagina, a woman was a man's vagina, a beautiful woman was a man's, a Venus of Aphyra, or a woman's cunt.</p> <p>And then to say that the vagina was good with a man's cock. So was the woman's vagina. Then to say that a man's cock could be better with women's cunt can be a statement or an admission. A statement is a statement. They might say that they are better than the woman, but that is an inaccurate comparison. They are true of the other. Or should be, if it is more accurate. Why would they have to be a statement? Because what they said is true.</p> <p>Or maybe, the fact that their genitals can be enjoyed is not that good. I know that they think it can be better to do that yourself. It is easy to compare. It's much easier to describe. But that's not true. The vagina and the vagina are different, if your body does not have a vagina, you may be happier, or just as happy.</p> <p>That is just the problem with what the Roman Empire is. For what purpose is it to be a better sex, the sex to be sex? You want a better sex, and you expect that you want a better sex. You want another sex, and it is something greater. The sex is a sex you can have, it is great, and it is better than the sex you expect to have. That is what the Romans were saying that it is greater to share life pleasures than to share your life pleasures. They were saying that it was better for them to have sex, to experience life pleasures with pleasures. It is better. But it wasn't true to have pleasures be happy sex to want pleasure. To be happy, to be happy, becauseâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
