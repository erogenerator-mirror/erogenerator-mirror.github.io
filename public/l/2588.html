What Soever The Soveraigne Doth, Is Unpunishable By The Subject</h4><p><strong>Fiftly, and consequently to that which was sayd last, no man that hath Soveraigne power can justly be put to death, or otherwise in any manner by his Subjects punished.</strong> I was the exception in this case, and in order my brains shut out the sound of my voice. And since all of my senses were at once overwhelmed by a haze or by other sounds, I simply dutifully focused again upon the situation.</p> <p>We can make the best sex life a woman and a man could ever have. My fingers slowly explored the inside of my lover's pussy lips, spreading them apart. My hands explored, caressed, cupped, groped, and delighted in the silky feel of his sweet, supple pussy, as I was discovering all that had been stored for me in the past, since the memory was brought on to me by his voice. It was now that I was able to focus fully on the present, and the reality I had so desperately needed. I was a voyeur, and this man was a voyeurist. I was being a woman in her most private and delightful way, with a man she wanted to be in the other day, now with a man she needed to be in the next, not in this moment of our lives.</p> <p>As one, my lovers were taking their pleasure from each other. And I was doing likewise, from either of their viewpoint.</p> <p>Her mouth found the spot where it was always most accessible in a kissing relationship. She nibbled on it gently, then teased it with her tongue. When the tip emerged from her mouth, as in one hand, she caressed its hardness from outside its cover, while the other hand played in its little area. I could also see it move in response, with the tip poking the inside of her mouth. It was as if she was pulling her lips apart, and I could literally see the pinkness of her lips, even though I had been inside them while trying this position, only one day earlier, and not again, just yet. Her fingers were exploring, stroking, feeling for each area, and then exploring that area, again as I had seen them doing with their hands outside those other times before, all the while. She was sucking, kissing, licking, then kissing again, and again she had two fingers exploring, then teasing the whole of the area. The way her lips parted, the soft moistness surrounding her. I was in seventh heaven, at last in something I was sure I could never have expected, with my own hands at my sides, my eyes closed, and my head thrown back.</p> <p>I was feeling the pressure building up and ready. She was working her way upward into the depths of herself towards the goal of having my tongue in place. And I was about to receive it. My hands were already guiding her lips upward, and I was about to receive it, when suddenly, she stopped and looked up at me.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" she asked, very concerned.</p> <p>"Nothing, just doe's pussy."</p> <p>I watched and saw her hand on the back of my head, the way the waves were rushing over her, and the way the ocean was rushing into the sea to break down the water. "No, it's just that..."</p> <p>Her hand made a motion over my face. "No, not you," she laughed, "you're not on the beach, now are you? We'll have enough time to do this later, because I'm still wet with the memory of your tongue just as good as this, anyway."</p> <p>I thought I must be dreaming, it was as if I had just been transported through a dream into another world.</p> <p>And yet we did do it, it was as if I had just emerged from some erotic place for all to enjoy.</p> <p>We kissed, the softness was comforting, and we were both more relaxed now than after all that had happened already. I felt the heat coming off the water, it was a warmth that warmed me and made me feel good. I could see that she still had a hard time to believe how it felt. And I could see that we still had to kiss, to kiss each other. There was only one way that we could go yet without that first kiss. I looked up at her, with a shy look of disappointment that only one moment before had been returned.</p> <p>She started to laugh and I could understand how that could make her happy. "You must make me happy, my dear," she said. "No one else can do it for me, I have found you for me, that's who I really am."</p> <p>We kissed, and I could feel the tension building in both of us. My hands moved upward to caress her face, and we kissed once again, passionately, but not hurriedly nor hurriedly, but with as much passion as there was at that moment in between us. Her body and mine. We kissed again we both got lost time to spare a little feeling time to experience, and a moment. She felt every part way I could be just kissing our bodies to touch, a sensation onlyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
