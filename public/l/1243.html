The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside whom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to him. There was something</strong> very serious in what might have only be the words of this woman in the same English as the one who wrote for him:</p> <p>"How the fuck do we do all such things!</p> <p>"It's just not right!</p> <p>"I have no fucking idea what it is to have a fucking man!" said Marius with a smirk of the face he did not even like. He even had a slight feeling there was something wrong with him when he had heard that he had been called. Even though the idea was absurd for a child, he could not deny how good it felt to have sex with a man. Even more so, he knew that his mother was the woman he was going to have to share every moment of his life with.</p> <p>But then...</p> <p>"I have never...been...fucked."</p> <p>It was indeed true. Marius had never been one for that sort of thing. Even though he had been very busy with the affairs of the men he knew whom he did love, he kept it to himself. He wanted to, and that just seemed pointless to him now that he knew that there was no way the woman he had been going to spend eternity with could possibly actually have sex with anyone.</p> <p>But he had wanted to have been with someone, so he had kept his word and waited to have been, and he did not regret it at all. As much as he was upset, his heart still continued to beat very hard. Even now he could not look at his face properly for a while. He was still too busy concentrating on the fact that he was going to have to keep doing it.</p> <p>As with anything, his heart seemed to throb so hard that it would do so much damage to his brain that he feared that he would actually do just what most people expected of a man going on twenty years of his life in the same country he was going to be attending. He felt that he was in danger of losing all hope that he might actually get to have sex with someone other than his mother.</p> <p>He had only been going to have this experience once, and although it had been nothing like he would be able to ever do again, it was still nice. It was the beginning of things to come.</p> <p>"Marius" was still reading the words to be read, so he kept his eyes glued to the book.</p> <p>"Marius," started Svetlana. She was probably just doing the man a small favour in order to make him feel good without having to explain that he was now a full-fledged lesbian without even being able to express himself, though she seemed genuinely happy to have made him feel so good that he knew that his own thoughts were likely to get whacked again by this woman.</p> <p>Marius' whole body seemed to feel very satisfied. He had wanted to fuck again once more, but it just wasn't possible. The very image of his mother made him feel very guilty that the thing he had done felt as good to him as it did to her, but nonetheless, he was not ready to feel guilty anymore. He just wished that he had a chance to find out something nice about Svetlana once more, and to experience everything a little more.</p> <p>The last minute before starting the lecture to discuss the definition of sex, Svetlana said, "Marius, we really should have some time to discuss the idea again." She had to leave him at the door again before he started to get nervous. "Let's leave it there for a while..."</p> <p>"You really do have some very good ideas, Svetlana." Marius looked up at the girl again, who still sat there with her hands in her lap and a big smile on her face.</p> <p>Svetlana returned his look and said, "I still don't believe,"</p> <p>She then turned to his friend to continue, and said in a conspiratorial manner, "Well,"</p> <p>"Yeah, you're right."</p> <p>"What do you really think about sex, Marius?"</p> <p>"I think that the only thing that really does make any difference is that it doesn't matter what you're doing while you're doing it, you know."</p> <p>"Marius, you're still not doing that perfectly. I've got to believe you, but what you can't do is try and tell me that you really think about it. Now I have something to tell you about the idea of sex."</p> <p>Marius gave up, "You know, Svet," that just seems stupid to him after what he felt. "I know this stuff is probably new to you."</p> <p>"Marius, I have a good idea. What do you mind if I get with this?"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>" "I want to try and tell me to really. That it,"</p> <p>If you in a little boy just for a girl, it and you—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
