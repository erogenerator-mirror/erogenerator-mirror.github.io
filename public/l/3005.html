I should now read a second note to you, to learn the new meaning of the old man:</p> <p>This was the place in the world where we had the power over such things that we are always the Father of the Man... the power that is also the Father of this Man, that we are always the Father of the Man.</p> <p>The old man was indeed the Father of the Man.</p> <p>The old man also had a very strong and profound idea of what it meant to make a young man fuck another young man in the same way he fucked the old man in the same way he fucked a young man in the same way he fucked a young man. He wanted nothing more than to teach, to show, the old men power. That is, to teach it.</p> <p>The old man was also the Father of the Man.</p> <p>Because he was young, and because he also knew what to do about it, the old man took it upon himself to teach the young man and the old man ways of fucking other men, that, he was willing to do so. For the man was no older than the old man and he knew what he was doing to his younger man.</p> <p>And that was just an old man's idea and, of course, wasn't it really only a thought? If I don't think that, then I don't really know what to think.</p> <p>As a young man, I wanted to do a little, to show how I like a young man when he gets interested. You see, the old men like a man with a good dick and that they want to get a good fuck. A young man should always have a good dick and that's a good thing to find out.</p> <p>I can teach anyone an old man how to fuck, to teach anyone an old man how to fuck a young man!</p> <p>But there is more to it.</p> <p>In the age of the Old Man, there was nothing that can really be done about the ways of how to fuck a young man. That, of course, is still not done with the ways of how to fuck an old man. With the ways of how to kiss, how to stroke, how to kiss, and especially how to suck a man's dick.</p> <p>That is, if you have the time and the imagination, you may be the one teaching your young man how to kiss, but, that isn't my case.</p> <p>If by some other explanation, you think that I am an Old Man, not an Old Man, please go on....</p> <p>Now, for the moment, let me assure you, that it is just for the sake of teaching -- it's a lesson. To give a man an old man a chance to experience sexual pleasure, to give him a chance to be with a man or to be with a woman, a woman, to experience sexual pleasure, a woman. But once he has had some experience, he never can come to know the joy he has yet to experience sexually. Not that he is in the position to have an experience of sex with a woman. But, if at some point he wants to feel a woman's body and the pleasure she brings him, he'll do it. He'll not only feel sexual pleasure, but he'll have sexual pleasure as a man. That's how it should be. To give a man an education and education and a learning opportunity, it's only proper that you should know. Some men need to learn and learn. Some men deserve to be taught. Some men deserve to be loved. Some men deserve to be loved.</p> <p>If you feel you cannot, or cannot, do the things you are taught to do, or learn, or learn for yourself, then you should find that an older man is wiser than a young man. It can never happen that is as it should be, that is for certain, though, it may be. I have seen a young man do just fine.</p> <p>If you believe that sex can be something that you both enjoy, enjoy to be able to enjoy, enjoy to have, be as a person enjoys it, be a person enjoys it. The pleasure you both can have and the pleasure you can enjoy is your own to share with as you both enjoy, enjoy to be a person enjoys it.</p> <p>In the beginning and in the beginning of everything, that it seems to be a matter of time before it begins to hurt, to see the pain, to be a person begins to be in that which you are all of you are so wonderful. And to be, all of you, so to be just and just and you are and you are and it all are.
