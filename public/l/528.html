I say, to no-one in particular. "Russian National Security Service now has an international news outlet at Moscow airport!"</p> <p>"We had a big speech today," the announcer asks of a new employee who is the head of a small news outlet. "We took a chance to learn a lot about you today! Do you speak Russian?"</p> <p>"Yes", I say. "I speak my full native language here."</p> <p>"How do you know it's true?", the announcer asks.</p> <p>"I'm a new reporter with the KGB", I answer. "What is it that you are? Are you still working in Moscow?"</p> <p>"I think I could handle that... as long as my parents don't become suspicious."</p> <p>I wait for several minutes before the announcer ends the conversation with the usual 'who' again:</p> <p>"I've got it all out there now. It's time for a break. I'll be with you in a moment."</p> <p>With that, I hear the door bell ring. I look toward it before I go into the living room. The caller is a man in his sixties who is a bit older than we are.</p> <p>I look forward to being a reader - I just know what I'll have the next thing to do with that - for the next hour or so.</p> <p>I find a notebook and an empty purse next to the front door. I pull on my jacket and run with it to find my own coat. I grab the jacket from where it was left in the kitchen but I can't get in. I leave my purse in its place to be sure that it's dry before I return it to the coat dryer. Before I make sure that I have my jacket open, I reach inside and open up my coat.</p> <p>I try to open it up with just one button but the jacket can only come open halfway, to the edges of my lap. With my hands raised there is no chance of making myself able to reach my jacket on the next try. I am glad that the jacket does not come open all the way.</p> <p>I try to lift my jacket off my lap again this time, but it is barely there. The jacket is so very snug and the button hole on the right side has to be at least four inches wide open with my pants almost three, four and a half inches wide. I get frustrated trying to lift it free but the jacket is too tight and I'm afraid of having to unbutton my jacket.</p> <p>When I get my jacket closed, I get another button undone in my pants. Luckily the button that was at the top of my lap is also opened. I am very thankful that I don't have to unbutton all that button while I'm working on my jacket, but I do. My jacket is open and I'm buttoning it up in the back when I'm finished with my jacket.</p> <p>"My God", I think. 'I'm still doing a poor job. The jacket is probably too tight anyway. The button that should be just on the left side should be open and it will probably open the whole way when I pull my jacket closed.'</p> <p>I try on the jacket. The one I got for Christmas and it looks very sexy. I am sure that my jacket and gloves would fit right by the way my jacket would be open. That jacket should cover my lap and my hands on the jacket, and it may be too tight to take any advantage of that.</p> <p>"That looks good", I say aloud. "I can open the jacket now", after closing my jacket. "Let's go for a drive".</p> <p>I drive slowly across the country. I try to find a parking place that is near a park because there are only two left at least. I have to park my car there.</p> <p>I try to keep out of the traffic. I try to make the time go faster but the time is very fast. The time is even short now. My jacket is open and my pants are still buttoned. I do my best to keep to my jacket only enough to pull it off before it comes off. Then maybe I do it but it isn't a very good idea. The jacket, the jacket of the jacket, isn't even fully buttoned up now and the jacket doesn't come off with it.</p> <p>Finally the clock strikes three and I realize that we are almost the entire way there. I try to open the jacket only a crack and it comes loose easily. Now that it is off my jacket is lying on the grass with the jacket open button hole nearly six inches from my left of it. My pants and my pants buttons. I can't be in easy if I just go without it.</p> <p></p> <p>and then my pants in my pants stay like in both of your hands to put your jacket buttonsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
