My penis is inside her pussy, which is contracting, squeezing back around it. She wants me to fuck her long and hard. We’re both on our back, just out of breath, and in the middle of nowhere. She’s riding me with a passion, and I am on the edge of falling off the bed. Our pubic bones slam together, and the bed is creaking all the way down my calves.</p> <p>Julien’s orgasm is about to erupt. It's so intense, it makes her scream. I can feel it coming. My body responds automatically. I’m coming like a fire hose, firing my seed into her. We’re so close now. I'm on my back, and she’s in my lap in a flash. Our mutual orgasm is so intense, I don’t think I’ll be able to hold on. She leans down, and she feels me come. She doesn’t move, doesn’t say anything, just stares at me.</p> <p>My hands are out of the water. I’m dripping in the puddle under us. She’s staring at me, and suddenly drops off the edge of the bed, sliding forward. Her vagina grips my penis, pulling me in. It goes all the way into her.</p> <p>I am feeling totally fucked. It’s as if a huge weight has fallen from my body and started to lift from my body. My erection has come to rest against the top of hers, at the base of her vagina. The pressure on my thighs and her vagina makes her legs begin to tremble. She leans down to kiss me. We make our bodies intertwine again and again while my penis is inside her and her vagina is milking me. In the water, my hands are out of the water, and I rub her vagina. In the puddle and beneath us in the puddle it is like a wild storm—I don’t know where it comes from. It just seems so right. I have never wanted anyone more in my life.</p> <p>The water is hot. The air is cool. The temperature is in the upper 20’s. Just my penis in Julien, lying on top of her, is making her happy. Her vagina is squeezing my penis the whole way up. It’s almost like it wants me but can’t. We’re just touching—her skin is on the bottom edge of the puddle, her pubic hair and mine on top. This is too fast. It must be getting closer. I can feel the start of it coming.</p> <p>It’s starting to hit. I can’t stop it. She says something, but I think nothing means much. She comes, and I can feel the muscles inside her pussy squeezing my penis as I come into her. We’re so close, and as she starts to calm down, I start to move. It feels so wonderful, so intense. It doesn’t go on for very long. I’m on my back, and we’re floating on the water together in the warm puddle under us.</p> <p>I’m thinking about our sex life together, and how beautiful it is to have sex this way. I can't believe how much I want to know about Julien, to know she can do this. I know what she wants. A lot of it. So much stuff that only happens in movies, the real deal. It’s real. Julien and I have sex in public all the time, in the woods, sitting in the car, on public bus rides, on the beach. I mean, it’s real. There’s no turning back. I think we’ll both be happier.</p> <p>I can feel it starting again. It starts with two long strokes into Julien. And we make love while the puddle is rising. I’m coming into her again, and I hold her up while it continues. Oh, it’s starting.</p> <p>I’m on my back. She’s sitting on me, her legs on either side, and her pussy is still squeezing my penis, so I’m completely exposed. This isn’t exactly the same sex to me all the time, but at the moment I feel like it’s all right, and everything will be just right. It’s just so awesome to have her, and everything will be right, I tell her.</p> <p></p> <p>…I can’ve felt another orgasm building in my penis swelling up. Just like the pucker is going through. He starts to explode.
