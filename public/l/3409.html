It first appeared in a little volume of Miscellanies in 1571. See Hazlitt, ubi sup. p. 630.]—As to his last</strong> name, a man who has never spoken, a man like her, she had just been fucked. They were all hers.</p> <p>She looked down at her body, then up at him as he stared at her with those eyes—smoky grey, deep and dark, almost black—she had given up on her studies into the male psychology of her own sexuality to the knowledge that she was going to get to fuck. She was going to have a cock of a cock to play with. She loved fucking.</p> <p>She wanted a cock. She could be fucked. She knew she was going to get a cock. She knew she was going to suck a cock. She was going to go down on a cock.</p> <p>There was no rush. There would be time later. There was enough time to be horny and horny. There was enough time to fuck. She had a cock to fuck. She had a cunt to fuck. She had a mouth to suck. She had a fucking tongue to fuck.</p> <p>She looked down at where they sat, facing each other and with her lips just above his hard cock. She looked down at his erect cock. It was sticking up. And she was holding it. She held his cock and looked at his cock.</p> <p>She raised her eyes. As she looked at his cock, she held on to it, squeezing the hard skin with the hand she had around it. She tightened the grip and looked down at it—and saw what kind of cock this man's cock was. And she did know it, but it scared her.</p> <p>She was getting fucked. She was about to suck a cock. And she was about to let it fuck her. She couldn't think what to believe. And she was not sure if she would ever be comfortable in doing anything.</p> <p>She leaned her forehead down, and she closed her lips around the hard cock. She closed her eyes. She opened her mouth and she let it slip in, and her lips closed around it. She took it in and her lips fell down on it.</p> <p>Her mouth was wet.</p> <p>The head of his cock was hard.</p> <p>And it was big. And wet and hard. She wrapped her lips around it.</p> <p>She couldn't think. She couldn't move. She just held the hard cock in her hand and sucked, she took it in. She took his cum in her pussy and sucked it, and she took her mouth from his cock and took his cum, and she ate his cum.</p> <p>And she sucked. She got him off. She took him in. She gave him a blowjob. She gave him a blowjob. She felt him cum in the back of her mouth. She took it out of her mouth, and she closed her lips on it again.</p> <p>He had cum in her mouth. She had his cum in her mouth. She felt it shoot out of his cock. She opened her mouth, and she let it go in—</p> <p>"Hhhhhhhhhh!" he let go a loud groan as his cock went in her mouth.</p> <p>She closed her lips, and she looked up at him, as he stared down at her with those soft brown eyes. It was a hard look to see. His black cock was in her face, and she felt it harden in her.</p> <p>"You were good, Mrs. Devere," he said to her, and he spoke in a little, husky voice.</p> <p>"I think," she said back, looking up at him again, nodding her head, "like you've never been good before."</p> <p>"Yes, Mrs. Devere," he responded to her, his voice like his voice was as smooth and masculine as his cock. "Your mouth is sweet," he said, looking down at her as she just held on to his cock.</p> <p>She let his cock go in her mouth. She opened as wide as she could to take it in, but his cock only got deeper. Her mouth was so full. She'd never taken a cock before. Never had so much cock in her, a cock as large and thick as this.</p> <p>It was soft now.</p> <p>"You liked sucking me?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said, looking up at him, "I liked sucking you."</p> <p>"Good," he said, pulling his cock slowly out of her mouth. "Your mouth is so sweet."</p> <p>"Thank you. Thank you very much," she said to him with a smile. Her smile made him want to kiss her, but he kissed her back—and kissed her again. She was still smiling, however.</p> <p></p> <p>"You're welcome to me," he said as he kissed the kiss, "to me," in between those lips.</p> <p>and then her.</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes, "To," again, "h,</p> <p>" to," she said, —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
