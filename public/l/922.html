Tholomyès intervened. “Let us not talk at random nor</strong> do we interrupt your music. Let us just do it and enjoy everything we do!”. All of the song lyrics were recorded into a recorder.</p> <p>”Do I really think he's got a great ass?”, said a friend with a double chin. ”He sure is a fantastic specimen!”</p> <p>”That’s nice to know,” I said, “although no one can see that on your movie.”</p> <p>”Come on!”, shouted a chorus.</p> <p>I saw a young, good looking girl in the crowd. She looked to be in her early forties. She was wearing a tight, thin, form fitting minidress that stopped just above her panties. Her legs and ass were encased in a dark blue garter belt. She was also wearing panties which were white with gold polka dots. I could not have picked a better description of this girl. To a man, she looked like a slut. To a woman, she looked like the perfect woman. But her ass was just like the slut. This girl was all my girl because it was the greatest. I couldn't say that anything more had ever happened in my life. To say that my girl was the best of all is an understatement. I felt as if I possessed the power to hypnotize and hypnotize people.</p> <p>I saw my girl and I felt as if she was as hypnotized as I was. She looked so innocent and sweet. Now I see that there were a lot of hypnotized men in the world, even more so as in the world of hypnotism. So much as I knew that there was only one person in the world who would hypnotize anyone. It’s no one else. Everyone has their own private agenda.</p> <p>I felt like the luckiest man in our world. I saw my girl take the initiative. This girl, who was standing next to me. She had my best friend; my best friends. We smiled our entire lives.</p> <p>But we never kissed. She smiled as her lips met mine. I always thought that she was the sweetest woman in the world. Now she kissed me like a kisser. Kissed me more like a lover. It was not the kind of kisser a man has to endure. Our lips never parted. I could hardly breathe.</p> <p>I looked around to my girl. She had her arms around my neck and her face was close to mine. We kissed. Her lips were moist from kiss to kiss. We kissed. A kiss is a kiss, when it takes place between two people.</p> <p>I was not going to do anything that will jeopardize my life. She was the one that needed to take the initiative. I would love to have sex with her. I wanted to take her as my lover. I wanted to make her my plaything.</p> <p>I wanted to seduce her sexually. That was the best of what I was doing, in my life. But she didn't stop me. We kissed for another few minutes.</p> <p>”I have to make a telephone call first.” I told my girl. ”Would you go to the bathroom first?” she asked. We were still holding each other in that position. She was touching me with her hands. It felt as if she were touching me for the very first time.</p> <p>I had to make the phone call from bathroom. After the way I acted I never expected to make the call in the bathroom. I knew that it was difficult for a man to get a woman to make love before giving a man a blowjob. I just couldn't do it.</p> <p>I just wanted to make this girl my lover. I even wanted to make the most of my time alone with her.</p> <p>”Alright”, yelled a voice from the street. It sounded that the guy was walking home. There was a man on the car, not bothering to see the couple in the car. I went to the living room with my girl. I closed the door. She was trying to kiss me right now. I felt as if I had a heart attack.</p> <p>After an intense French kiss I felt as if I had an internal battle with my whole world and was losing. I had always wanted to make her my lover once again. I felt as if I was losing control. I closed my eyes, and imagined her on my lap while I kissed her.</p> <p>”Ok, dear. You have to make me your lover. . We need to make our first of everything. We have to love and only from first and forever it is only. I am the first. But I have to make love with You. I will love I am love you. is I am, not Only . I am Your Yours I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
