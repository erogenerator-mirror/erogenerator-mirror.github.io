Meanwhile, the chess game itself began to get underway. But Napoleon was in no hurry to get there. The cards had been folded; however, there were five men lying at the table ready to have the day begun.</p> <p>All three males lay at five feet of height. They each had a man sitting in a chair, facing the table. Thus, their faces were about two feet apart. In fact, their chest and stomachs were touching. And when they weren’t kissing or licking each other’s nipples, the three males were massaging their manhood and, with their heads together under the table, their mouths were busy at some hidden part of their manhood or, more likely, their balls.</p> <p>At first, the men were toying with their member on their fingers, but, as soon as the players found their fingers touching the two men, they were toying with the other. Now they’re toying with each other’s balls. At this point—not for the first part of the game as Napoleon has mentioned later, just for the sake of the game, this will seem like a little too close as it is—the men’s hands were touching each other’s balls. So this was to be their secret.</p> <p>The women were already toying with their penis. And now they were toying with it with their mouths. Both boys were also toying with theirs as well, though—although they weren’t doing it together.</p> <p>“So that’s it. Here we go, little men. It’s time for the game”, said Napoleon. But the women’sss hands continued to stroke the other’s penis. Now the man and his partner were toying with each other’s nuts.</p> <p>At this point, the game’s first act was to be to take the initiative. It turns out that the man’s penis had already entered some of the wives. Therefore, both the men’s hands were now toying with their erections as the game progressed to the first part.</p> <p>After sitting up and observing the game as it progressed, the three men, lying beside the woman's right side and on their side, were toying with their penis on each other’s legs. The game continued until there was nothing left to do.</p> <p>“My turn…is it to be to togggered or to be kissed or to be licked?”, asked Napoleon. Then he told the women, “It is done here.”</p> <p>As the women watched the men’s faces, waiting for their turn, and waiting for their next turn, so they were toying with each other’s cock, with their faces close to the men’s penises and heads.</p> <p>“I think I’ll lay along side the other.” said Napoleon.</p> <p>But, before they started, the man and his partner couldn’t wait any longer. As the two men and his partner lay along the side of the other’s body, still waiting for the action they were about to take, the women began to stroke the men’s penis with their hands and with tongues.</p> <p>One after the other, their hands began to explore their manhood and their testicles. The women were also toying with their lips and inserting their tongues with their tongues! Both men’s hands were roaming over their partners’ asses as they kissed. It was quite an enjoyable activity. They decided to lie along their sides and they continued to kiss, lick, and lick each other’s faces.</p> <p>After all the women’s hands left their bodies for a little while, they stopped kissing the penis and the balls.</p> <p>“My turn…” said Napoleon.</p> <p>The game was to be to be moved to togger and to be continued, if the men’s cocks were to toggered or to be licked.</p> <p>On the next round of the game, the men’s fingers started to toying with their own penises.</p> <p>They are the most active, the two men in front of their partner are toying with their penises, and both are toying with their testicles and toggling their penises!</p> <p>The guys were toying with their penises, but they are not toying with their cocks.</p> <p>They were toying with their erect penises.</p> <p>They were toying to their penises, while they were toying with their penises. the cock, while they were toying with their penises. ””: and penises.””:”:”:”:”, “—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
