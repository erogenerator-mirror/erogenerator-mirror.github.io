Mr. Bounderby felt that Mrs. Sparsit had audaciously</strong> allowed him to fuck her so that she could become pregnant. His brain shut down.</p> <p>"We aren't going to fuck, we are going to make love," declared Mr. Boundary.</p> <p>"We aren't even doing that." Mrs. Sparsit interrupted his thoughts. Her hands began to fidget between her legs.</p> <p>"Please do, please do," begged his own words from his mouth.</p> <p>"Fuck, fuck, fuck," he repeated as his cock throbbed with each beat of his heart. The urgency of his voice.</p> <p>"I don't know about that," he said in a whisper.</p> <p>"We're not really going to fuck." Mrs. Sparsit was disappointed and impatient. Her thighs were tightening. Her feet touched the bed where they were joined by her arms on Mr. Boundary's chest. "We're not even fucking." Mrs. Sparsit couldn't stop herself from moaning.</p> <p>"Oh, God." Mr. Boundary put his hands on Mrs. Sparsit's shoulders for support and guided her backward until she sat next to him on the bed. The head of his cock grazed her thigh as they continued to kiss. It was all that he had. His own cock felt that much different from what Mrs. Sparsit had felt when they did the deed in their dreams. It was different. So much better.</p> <p>"Just do it, fuck."</p> <p>Mr. Boundary was unsure of himself. He had been ready and willing to fuck Mrs. Sparsit in her most recent moment, and now that she was willing, but it felt like she took the time to put it all on hold a little longer. He felt like he wanted to push his cock to the back of her throat, but he would have wanted to do it again. He just couldn't bear not being able to. He knew that Mrs. Sparsit had something other than what he wanted and needed, and there wouldn't be a moment of rest in her life when his own desire had to be satisfied.</p> <p>Slowly, Mrs. Sparsit unbuttoned her blouse and reached between her legs. Her eyes never left Mr. Boundary's face. In that fleeting moment, nothing else mattered than that of her own desire. Her face was flushed, but Mrs. Sparsit only got more flushed when she realized what she had just done.</p> <p>"Shit," said Mr. Boundary as he reached over and grabbed Mrs. Sparsit's hair. He began to kiss her as Mrs. Sparsit closed her eyes and moaned out loud. Then, before the first kiss even reached her lips, Mr. Boundary's tongue pressed into Mrs. Sparsit's mouth. There was no tongue, but he could feel it. It danced with the taste of herself on his tongue. She was wet. His cock stiffened again. He wanted more than any of this.</p> <p>"Fuck." Mr. Boundary's cock erupted to its full potential. He felt like his cock was erupting out of him as well.</p> <p>As Mrs. Sparsit turned her face towards him and took his tongue in her mouth, her hands reached between her legs. A single finger found its way into her vagina. The moisture was even greater.</p> <p>The kiss went on, their mouths and tongues became one. Their fingers danced their dance. Finally, Mr. Boundary couldn't restrain himself anymore. He wanted more of her.</p> <p>Mrs. Sparsit grabbed his cock with both hands. "Just fuck me," she almost pleaded again. She tried looking at the ceiling but the sight of her naked body on the floor brought her back to reality. She felt no guilt; she wanted this. There was something more. Something that the past few days had caused that she didn't realize was there. She just wanted more of what she had dreamt a million times of being withâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
