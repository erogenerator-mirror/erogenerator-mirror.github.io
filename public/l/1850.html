They seek for themselves private retiring</h4><p><strong>places, as country villages, the sea-shore, mountains; yea thou thyself art wont to long much after such places. But all this thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest</strong> end of the universe. The sea-shore, mountains, sea-shore; all you want, when thou shall need it, is the most lovely place, that ye can live.</p> <p>The only place a man could fuck was the ocean side of the continent of Asia. The place he had first looked through his telescope. A place of peace and tranquility, with the ocean's gentle current. But soon, he found that not one, but two beaches, to be the best beaches, the sandiest beaches of all. And then, like all the beaches, these the beaches, were the sandiest beaches of all. The sand was smooth and clear. It seemed as if there was no other place in the world as this secluded area. His only regret was that he had to get up there himself. But how could he say no, on a beach like this, when so many others were there?</p> <p>Not having any other option, he put his hands down and kneading his buttocks. His cock had begun to soften already. He had not made it easy for many, but he would make it hard for as many as he wanted. He was not as fit as the youth he would fuck right now with that cock of his, but he knew that he could keep a man alive. For there was a good chance, for that would be the time when he would be able to finally enter a woman he wanted to fuck. He was not quite ready to let that happen. But the girl was already wet. The girl he would fuck. He would be ready for her. He wondered what, then, would be, on earth so beautiful, so hot, so inviting, and in this beach, so safe.</p> <p>He heard a groan, of relief. A sound of desperation from the girl. She had not expected him to reach her, nor to get her, before he got rid of his clothes. She wanted to see him naked, as she had seen the other men of the beach in bathers and clothes, and now, she wanted him undressed too. She could feel his cock again moving inside of her body. She wanted him to fuck her. She knew it would be good. She felt the waves on the beach moving around her hips. She was ready to be fucked by a strong man, by one man. She was ready to have his hard cock between her legs. She wanted to feel him. She knew it would be good to have that hard cock between her legs too. She could feel him throb inside her sex. It was the hard cock, that she wanted. It would be good for her to have it inside her pussy. She wanted him, and she wanted to have him, as bad as he wanted her. So, she could see the other men, all the other girls, watching, and she could be sure of it later. She loved it, she wanted it. She wanted all of the men to watch her, all them seeing her, in her body, taking her, letting her touch himself, as she pleased. She had to see him inside of her, fucking her, when she wanted it. She wanted to feel him fucking her like the others had been screwing her. She saw her own pussy stretched, as one man fucked her, and another could see himself pushing his manhood into her, while she herself fucked herself with her own hand. She wanted all of it, for she wanted him to come in her.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you, now, all of you," he groaned out, "all of you, in a place where you are not hidden, by men." He wanted to know it too, as he wanted her to want him. He wanted her to want him. He wanted her to want him.</p> <p>The sounds of the young girl, with her hands full with the man of her friends, was making both of them sweat, she felt one of her friends rub a finger along her wet pussy lips. She too, wanted it too, it was her finger, she was feeling a man's cock inside her, inside her body. She felt it moving up into her womb, while she herself fucked herself, and felt her friend finger her even faster, in addition to her hand, her fingers, her other hand, in her wet, ready hand, she wanted to cum all over another man's cock. She had not wanted to cum in her mouth and to be fucked by her lover. She wanted to know that she was the reason the other men were fucking her. She felt and felt so turned on by the youngness standing there, as this naked woman, so lustily and lustily, was touching her as if she herself did. She felt two hands on her back, on her bottom, with her hands on her breasts, in addition to the ones hands on her hair and fingers in her hair, on her hands on her thighs, fingernails. She felt herself, on her own hands on both handsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
