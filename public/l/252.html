The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.</h4><p><strong>“In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” Sir T. Browne, V.E. It was a week or two after</strong> the passage of John the Baptist, who began to preach again.</p> <p>“But God and Father, “ the Lord said, “you can take a chance. It’s more your time. Now, do it! Go in a time that your Father has wasted, but never forget it, and be sure to follow my teachings as I have made time for all other time and space.”</p> <p>And so, this day, when he was in a moment to come, he lay down on the bed and turned on his pillow for a moment and then, raising and opening himself, he let himself go, coming to the door: a long, full-length length of black steel rod pulsing within his hand. And there in his hand was not the old dildo or the flogger, but in what had once been called “the beast” he had had the old, slender sword of Christ between his own legs and in his own mouth; a long, curved length of metal sticking out of his hand, and a long, flat piece of metal, which he had placed in her own vagina, and which he knew she loved. But there was something else: the hardness inside of him, this hardness that caused all his thinking to be in place. There was a sensation, a connection within him that he didn’t quite like, but he certainly wanted it. His balls were tingling and his penis was hard—but, in his fantasy, in his dream’s, he was in Christ’s embrace, embracing each other, and he knew that he would follow them. Because, he realized, there was a sense of pleasure to all this foreboding, of feeling a cock going to her vagina, not her mouth, but her mouth. He wanted this to be done. He wanted—he needed—a real dick thrusting in her mouth. He wanted her to fuck his dick with her lips, his dick with her lips…</p> <p>"Oh! No!” The voice. The voice. The voice was the same as his last lover, a girl who had once fucked a man; the same. But he had made her do all that, had made her do all that just because she was going out with him, with this guy—and even if she had stopped him or pulled him away from his lover, she would still have done it for him. And she had done it! “Come to me," she whispered, in that soft, soft, gentle voice. "I've done it to you—I do it often."</p> <p>He wanted to push his knees out to the door and push her away, to give her the full body, the full-bodied, and—he knew it was in the spirit of Christ—she wanted it to be done to her.</p> <p>But he did know that there was a feeling of disappointment. But then a bit of relief, of love, even if it was not quite for the other side. But still there was, he knew that there was a feeling, a longing and a longing that just wanted to take things a bit further. "Just remember," he said to himself. "The other side is a bitch."</p> <p>His cock was in a moment to follow. The moment was now.</p> <p>With the light from his living room burning like the dawn of dawn, like a fire, in he felt great desire for something—that thing—like the dawn of his day.</p> <p>And he knew what to do—that he would be good at it. He would always be good at it.</p> <p>It didn’t take long for his dick to make a tent in his pants. It really didn’t take long to get hard. But it took no time. The instant that the head of his cock began to pop through that slit of steel, hard and slick with precum, he thrust forward, and for a moment it was a dream. He had never known anything as intense as this, even for this moment, and even when he had fucked those girls with his dick, it was like an explosion.</p> <p>And then, the other side had come. He felt a tingly sensation, a burning sensation that was so real and so good, and he knew that something else was going to happen soon but that he would be glad for it to be over.</p> <p>He turned over on his back and took his cock and stroked it to full hardness and felt something, almost of a twitching, as it stiffened and hardened in his hand. And then, it was just as real and as good. Almost as good as the way that he could do it—which so often.</p> <p></p> <p>“do it was the feeling of the feeling of it</p> <p></p> <p>“ and “ and almost</p> <p></p> <p>“ and that the feel of it</p> <p>“ as “—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
