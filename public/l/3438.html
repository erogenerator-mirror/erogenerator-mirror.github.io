After all I had come twice. But we'd been drinking, and we'd just finished off a bottle of wine when our neighbour turned to look at us. "You've got something, aren't you, dear?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am," I replied.</p> <p>"Why?" she asked.</p> <p>"Because my boyfriend has not fucked me for a couple weeks."</p> <p>"Well we're not exactly the only ones who have, and what do you suggest we do about that?"</p> <p>I turned red. "Well, we can go up to my room." I said, with a hint of arrogance.</p> <p>"I thought you'd be too tired to fuck," replied Valour. "But what do you suggest we take for the next week?"</p> <p>"We can take my boyfriend's friend, and fuck him silly; that should do the trick," said the woman, as she took one of my hands and gave it a gentle squeeze.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, no argument," replied Valour, "so how about I go to your room? I'll just get undressed, then I can put my panties on, and then we can go have a quickie. No hurry, no worries." She paused.</p> <p>"And what might one say to fucking him silly?" asked the woman. "You might not like that idea though. He's a man; you're going to fuck him so he'll forget his penis ever happened; he'll never get hard again after I'm dressed."</p> <p>Valour turned the light off without touching me. "Don't worry, we'll have sex when I'm ready, then I promise he'll forget about everything else." I didn't know what to say in response, except to say that we weren't going to repeat what happened, anyway and that our behaviour was far above anything I'd had to do all night.</p> <p>-</p> <p>The following week Valour came down to the lobby. I was already naked from the waist down, so she sat on the sofa, taking the last of her wine and getting comfy. I took a seat on her bed to watch the women leave the theatre. There were two ladies on the seat, both chatting away to different people. My first impression was that the whole thing was just a matter of having a look at what I was expected to do; for Valour to be waiting on me.</p> <p>I looked around. There was probably no one else on the flat that I hadn't seen before and I was expecting that Valour wouldn't be there.</p> <p>But her friends were still standing close by. Valour's friend was an attractive young woman, with a cute, thin frame. She was wearing a short skirt and a loose blouse; her breasts were held together by a single, red bra. The bra was low cut; I guessed the straps just below her breasts.</p> <p>Valour had asked me to go to her room after the women had left, so I had brought the same sort of clothes she had. The bra was a plain bra, so that the material stretched across her breasts, and so that they would stick out quite a bit when I sat down. Her skirt was tight, but not as tight as the ones on her blouses.</p> <p>Valour made no move to help me undress and only nodded approvingly when I got up to my underwear, which made my dick jump. A woman on the sofa watched as I undressed and put my underwear on, then got up from the sofa and went and stood at Valour's side. "Oh, that looks nice," she said, "and I want to see it."</p> <p>She reached for my now erect prick and slowly rubbed it. Then her hand was on my chest.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she gasped, "I'm just nervous. This is something else. And my boyfriend is very old."</p> <p>I nodded absently, my dick hardening again. But it didn't happen; it happened. There was nothing else to do. It was all about Valour. Nothing else but a woman having sex.</p> <p>Valour looked up at the television. She smiled. "I hope you're not offended," she said, "it looks to me as though he needs a blowjob or a fucking on film."</p> <p>"But you can't see anything, you wouldn't have to undress," I replied, "and you don't need your clothes to see anything."</p> <p>Valour friends watched the film. I thought: 'We're going to our room together. We're going to fuck in private cinema and go to watch porn! We're meeting! I've no- porn. But I have sex.
