Immediately after having laughed, at Cosette’s graceful command, when no one was paying any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen and had gained</strong> his legs. This was one man, a man who knew how to please a woman. As she and the men of the night came to an almighty climax, it was an all-out sexual orgasm for the two couples.</p> <p>She, now in her middle-aged thirties, was still a little unsure about her sexuality. She did not recognize herself as a liberated spirit, despite being of a moral and religious age. She was not repulsed by society’s oppression of females, but was concerned about her own sexuality. On the many times she experienced a sexual encounter, she learned that she had never had a relationship with anyone as exciting as her own. In spite of her initial hesitancy, she became convinced that, though she did not feel like she should get married just for sex, she loved being with another male.</p> <p>In return, she enjoyed playing the role of the obedient wife and a willing participant in her own seduction. She loved to see the happy look both of their faces could give out to her sex partner. But she also enjoyed sharing their secret delights. She couldn’t get enough sex. She would not trade her life for her life. She loved spending time around naked men, especially one in the company of handsome, muscular men of the night.</p> <p>She had to wonder why she enjoyed the pleasure of a goodly proportion of them so much. As part of her education, she had been in a similar situation as others and that one thing, she learned, was that she enjoyed sex much more than many, in all aspects. When one man was a stranger, or a stranger she thought about how happy she would be every time she felt another man’s erect organ moving into her or a stranger’s mouth, her sex responded the exact same way.</p> <p>The men were very different from any other male she had known. Their erections were bigger, thicker, and longer. Her vaginal canal was like a small wet canal. Her own clitoris seemed so like a little dick, which made her more sexually frustrated. She found it easy to imagine getting all of her holes used by two or more men.</p> <p>Her sex became more and more sexual, in spite of a growing fear of unwanted pregnancy. A little more experience, she thought, was required to be able to be with a man that was a little older than her husband.</p> <p>In addition to men who were older, she discovered that younger men had more endurance, or sexual stamina than they did in their twenties. She realized that, though she did not enjoy the activity, some men had a more sexually stimulating libido than others and she knew that some men might enjoy sexual adventures as much as she did as much she did.</p> <p>The idea that she could learn so much sexual knowledge came to mind as a woman in her later years. She had learned early in her education that it was important for a woman to become a woman of understanding that she had her sexual experiences on display.</p> <p>Her early experiences, mostly with her hands and feet, would always require her to wear special underwear. Men would look at her, or sometimes peek at her, as she walked or sat to use the restroom. She would find the men watching her from the mirror when the bathroom door closed. The men would also enjoy seeing her legs or breasts bounce or move while she was in the stall.</p> <p>Then she'd slip on her heels and walk out into the store, where men would stare at her. She would usually leave the stall with a smile and turn toward the other men to ask for tokens to join the queue behind the cash register. They would pay cash for the tokens and she would walk into the dark room as the night progressed.</p> <p>Her first experience with two men in the dark room had been of a similar nature. One man used his fingers to part her labia and entered her vagina from behind. The other man, her first, was very quick to move into her.</p> <p>The man behind her had a lovely penis, as well as a nice-looking set of testicles. Her vagina was always warm and ready after a session, which had been quite an adjustment for her.</p> <p>She sometimes enjoyed seeing a penis come in and out of her vagina. She often wanted to reach one man's penis, without being forced to do so.</p> <p>When they were together in the dark room, she felt relaxed and happy, without being afraid to do so. She sometimes felt embarrassed about what she knew she would have to wear. Some men enjoyed watching a woman undress. She liked knowing that the men were watching.</p> <p>Her first experience with the men in the dark room made her feel very naughty and sexy. In spite of the fact that she was a woman of a certain age, she felt alive and free in a sexual freedom, as a freedom unknown to be nude in the shadows, she felt free to be free to be sexy in the world for a man to be sex. On her own, she was to have—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
