But as they drew towards the end of it, their</strong> senses still picked up on the presence of a large, wooden door and a second light. They heard footsteps and came upon their first night together.</p> <p>Her hand trembled as though in an earthquake, as though she were trembling. The room, it's light, stilled in their mutual silence and she looked around the room before returning her gaze towards the door that led to their own privacy. Her breath took out in a sigh of a gasp as she realized he was standing inside the room.</p> <p>She took a deep breath and took the time to remove her robe. Unfastening her belt and setting on the bed, she laid back down on the bed. She was trembling and her palms glowed with anticipation as though she had given permission to do something out of character and had given some sign that she was ready to do so. With a sigh, she rolled to her stomach and waited for him to appear in one of the more intimate moments of her life. Then she heard footsteps and he walked to be seen and was soon upon her in a flurry of clothing and his clothes on the floor before she felt a hand sliding across her nipple-pierced flesh. It sent electric currents through her abdomen from her breast to her pelvis. She closed her eyes, relishing the sensation of his fingers massaging her breast. He was so unlike her!</p> <p>He was so much like her as he gently pulled her toward him. She couldn't get enough of his attentions, which was what she had wanted since the moment they came into the room. Her hands slipped in his hair and she pulled in his lips to his. He kissed her with an ever-increasing hunger. She groaned as their hips touched. She felt the bulge of his cock pressing into her abdomen and she reached behind him and found it. It stood out proudly at attention for her to feel, almost as though it were a small beast and ready to take its claim on her. She felt him sliding down her neck and she let out a slight sigh of relief as she felt him nudge her legs apart. "Don't you ever get tired of my kiss..." she murmured. She wanted desperately to feel his tongue in her body.</p> <p>But in truth, there were so many desires she was so unsure of how to broach these. She wondered what it would be like to taste the saltiness of him, to taste the moisture of his seed and yet still have his skin inside her mouth. Maybe she should try to find out first, to discover if she would please his taste. Her mind swam with thoughts of him and what it was she herself was looking forward to exploring. She knew that was never more than a year in the future.</p> <p>He kissed her cheek, her eyelids, the hollow of her throat. He trailed his tongue down to her chest and kissed it, as though he were kissing her lips. She shivered and his warm breath and her hand brushed her skin as if a feather. He kissed her collarbone and she whimpered softly and his thumb reached down to circle her nipple as she sighed her breath in appreciation. His warm mouth closed around her breast and he began to suck and nip at her nipple. Her breath was coming in pants and sighs as the pleasure of his mouth was enough to fill her entire being. His right thumb slid back and forth across the nub of her nipple as she whimpered with delight. His left hand cupped and squeezed her other breast while he continued to suckle her other breast in turn, which in turn caused her to whimper and arch her back.</p> <p>The more she whimpered, the harder he nursed on her, and as he continued his attentions on her other breast she closed her eyes and leaned her head against his shoulder, pushing her breast into his mouth more eagerly. His free hand slid lower now and her hand reached down to squeeze his hand as his fingers played with her pussy. She gasped as he touched her, and he felt her hands clench in his hair, urging him to touch her more.</p> <p>"You're so wet! It's like you never knew I would touch you." He cupped her mound again and stroked his index finger up and down, coating his index finger with her fluids. "You want me to fuck you?" he teased as his finger slipped down into her pussy. "You want me to fuck you on the mouth?" She was breathing hard and moaning her head still turned towards him. A part of her knew that if only she could feel him inside her, the rest of her wouldn't exist - like they didn't exist at the moment. "Yes. I want to feel you inside me - just as much as you feel me inside you."</p> <p>she was so wet, so good. She wanted him inside her. Everything would have everything to feel the heat and be everything to have everything they always be everything he did.</p> <p>She gasped. Her eyes remained open, she openedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
