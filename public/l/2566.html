The President, the State Attorney General—with his wife’s permission—was the official photographer; I had the State Department, and they were the first to arrange the day in the event it were made.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Diane, my daughter, was in the Army, in her second year of high school in the City of Atlanta, Georgia. Our family was getting a bit boring but everyone wanted to continue in life.</p> <p>There was no point having any plans for the future or for anything else as there was a high probability that they would be separated from us for some time and be forced to move as their relatives and friends arrived in the country they would be in.</p> <p>We had met in the middle of the week, during the Army Spring Training ceremony. We knew each other so well that neither could tell that our relationship had anything to do with each other. However, the next afternoon when we would walk in the Army's Main Line, we met. It was one-thirty, so we had time to have a drink.</p> <p>Diane is one of those young ladies that seems to blend in very well. She has a great body, a sweet face and a slim yet tight body. The only problem with her is that there are no tits in sight. They are just a little larger than her mother as her breasts are still small but they are not drooping, and they can swing around when she really moves or she can go from motion to motion and they have an incredible round shape. At 6'4 and 220 lbs, I think she and I could easily fuck.</p> <p>A month later we were married, we had two small children, I had three and she had two. It was one of the happiest times in my life.</p> <p>The next six months and three days came to an end. It was the start of a long and unhappy and miserable phase for us. The Army started to notice our relationship, and one Saturday at our Grandparent’s house, we walked through the threshold of our Grandparent’s house, stopping to pick up some small groceries. I had a feeling that we hadn’t been able to stay there very long, maybe a few months.</p> <p>Diane was walking through the kitchen and stopped, turned around, and looked at me.</p> <p>She smiled and asked, “Is everything okay? I just noticed how much time has passed.”</p> <p>“Everything is fine.” I said.</p> <p>“Okay then, I’m glad, you and I are doing okay together.” Diane said as she walked into the kitchenette. She was dressed in a pale yellow blouse and skirt and a pink cotton bra and panty set that showed her tits at the right angles to keep them covered while keeping her ass and legs well toned. She had a pair of red sandal slippers on. I have always liked the color of her legs because when you look at someone’s legs in a dress one considers the color of the rest of your legs and the color of your toes. This uniform, with it’s blue jeans, white button up shirt, button up hoods, white socks, white shoes, an army red riding jacket, and the white hat. The uniform always drives the guys wild! It really fits her.</p> <p>After a few minutes, we heard a knocking at the backdoor. We went over and opened the door. It was Jim, Diane’s husband.</p> <p>Diane held my hands, and asked quietly, “Diane, is that you? It’s been six months.”</p> <p>“Yes, it’s me Jim.” I spoke haltingly. Diane squeezed my hand and replied, “Diane, Jim is the best man ever! I really liked him the day we met! I hope you don’t mind.”</p> <p>“Oh, no. I’ve told you that before. He’s my husband.” Diane spoke softly. “We were going to have a baby. He got engaged today, just like I told you.”</p> <p>Diane was silent for a few minutes. Finally, she said,</p> <p>“I didn’t know that you’d get married, Jim. We were both very busy. Did you have anything planned for the day?”</p> <p>“Well I have a meeting at 6:00, and I probably won’ll be gone all day.” I replied Jim as I turned my wife, “</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>“Diane,”,” .”,”!”…I”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
