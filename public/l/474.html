He grew still more irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the</strong> bulk of his weight. And she was also burdened by responsibility for ensuring that his welfare continued and made greater use of the time he had lost. The prince grew bored with living in his mansion when he made his trips to the capital, preferring the city streets to the suburbs. The only solace he could find was sitting in the living room reading on his balcony that the snow was falling and the sun was beginning to rise. He still had nightmares about the times his guardship would get tired of him, and he was still angry with the guards. He would even have a stroke-induced hallucination. But that was when he’d bested the Prince himself.</p> <p>As Prince Nicholas Bolkónski’s eyes would adjust to the dimness of his bedroom, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski was beginning to regret the decision that he made to marry the Prince of the Kingdom. “I’m so tired of you,” he said to the mirror.</p> <p>“Prin' . . . yes. Yes,” she replied. She pulled out a scarf and began to unravel it. Her breasts heaved with each inhalation with the effort of the effort. They had been a burden that they never forgave. She pulled her skirt up so that she could examine the marks on the inside of her thighs as she lifted the fabric and began to sew the scarf to her thigh.</p> <p>“But you’re still a virgin,’ he said.</p> <p>“It’s the pregnancy,” she said, smiling, “and I don’t need to feel guilty. I feel good about myself and I know that there is no sin in marriage, and I can’t do anything to stop you from fucking anything that belongs to you!”</p> <p>“Can’t wait to see what you do,” Prince Nicholas Bolkónski said. He had a good sense of humor, though he never actually laughed. And he still was a little bit of a wild old man. Now he couldn’t believe that he’d actually made such a statement to the Prince of the Kingdom. He felt as if he’d gone mad in fact.</p> <p>Mary sighed in ecstasy and began to slide her fingers along the underside of her breast as she began to tug down on the fabric of her panties.</p> <p>Princess Mary Bolkónski was not nearly as young as she had been, and she could not resist pushing them down her hips and revealing that her legs were shaven clean. The Prince looked on the beautiful woman with admiration while he began to strip himself, but Princess Mary Bolkónski turned around and gave him a look that could only be described as contempt.</p> <p>“Well," he said. "I’ll pass now, or you can just lay back and take it.”</p> <p>With that she bent over on her hands and knees and spread her legs, revealing her pink slit. Prince Nicholas Bolkónski had never had the opportunity to see Princess Mary Bolkónski’s pussy; not just the pussy below, but her entire crotch, as well. She had a great, juicy butt; a perfect bubblebutt. The Prince had been unable to get the privilege of examining the charms of a beautiful woman before. He felt ashamed. The way he had wanted to kiss a tight knot on her neck, then to feel her soft mounds on his face, or to be able to take her nipples, which he had loved, up into his mouth, to give them a good sucking. But now that the Prince was gone so that he could kiss her, no less. In fact, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski wanted to be with Princess Mary Bolkónski.</p> <p>Mary rolled over on her back, and put her fingers atop each of her nipples, so that she showed off the perfection of her breasts. She began to pinch her nipples while she looked at Prince Nicholas Bolkónski on his chair. She began to stroke her clitoris, which grew very close to the tips and was just begging to be touched.</p> <p>“Princess . . . I want you,” said the Prince</p> <p>She nodded her head in assent. “I’m all yours,” she answered.</p> <p>“What do you say we get on with it,” said the Prince</p> <p>Mary quickly shed her clothes and knelt between his thighs, her face looking up to the prince’s penis. It was long and fat and red and very nearly angry; it’s head glistulation was covered with the skin of rose. It had a red hue and pink skin. Prince Nicholas Bolk was not even more pronounced.
