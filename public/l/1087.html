Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his</strong> second marriage, Montparnasse was a king, a ruler.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"Hello, my sweet little slave!" my wife murmured in a sweet little tone of voice as she lay upon the bed, her thighs gliding over mine. "I have come to welcome you to our secret home. Our home and family of Paris! We will have to share this bed!"</p> <p>The bed was huge. At least I can say it was, in my humble home. My wife, a beautiful woman in her late forties and still as fit as a horse, sat on the side of the bed, her knees bent, her hand in the small of her back, her arms pulled back, her body arching, her head arched back, exposing her throat to my mouth and tongue. The dress-up comforter was on the side, on my side. It was the size she and her girlfriends used it when they had sex with me. The top of my bed was a full-length mirror that was about half-way down and half-way up; I could see myself as the bed, my head on the pillow and her body above my as she sucked me.</p> <p>"You can do anything you want to me, as long as my body is ready for that, that, that, that, that big thing in me!" I kissed her passionately as my wife continued to lick my manhood. At her urging I got up on the bed, and as I did I lifted her to her feet. I stood over her, then straddled her. I grabbed both legs, then stood up. I bent above her and kissed her. My hands stroked her arms, her shoulders, and my fingers stroking her breasts. I rubbed my hands over her upper arms before squeezing her hands together. She raised her arms, letting me have them and caressed me.</p> <p>My kisses stopped at her lips. I kissed her lips as I felt her hands moving down my chest to my cock. I put my hands under her arms and helped her pull her to her knees. She put her arms around me for balance and kissed me, running her fingers over my body and scratching her fingernails along my arms and chest. I cupped her breasts and my thumb rolled her nipples gently between little points of my thumbs. As they rolled and tweaked they sent a shiver of pleasure through me. I lowered my head to one and ran my tongue first up one of her nipples to the other, my tongue licking her soft skin between its two peaks. I pulled my head back for just a split second, then resumed kissing my way down over her shoulders, to each of her breasts just as I had the other.</p> <p>My lips followed the trail that her chest and her breasts ended, my tongue traced the valley between them, as I kissed and licked the tops of her breasts. As my lips approached the valley between them my mouth closed around her, sucking on her and enjoying her. At no point had I been in that position so much. Her breasts looked so beautiful. The nipples on them seemed so ripe and erect as I ran my tongue over them. As my mouth surrounded one of them I could feel her body arch.</p> <p>She lifted my head and kissed me again, my tongue darting between her lips, seeking hers out. As I kissed her she broke our kiss and took her hands from my head. I guided her hands upward and her fingers encircled me, pulling me between her legs. Her hands went to the headboard of the bed. She raised herself, straddling me, lowering herself once more to the base of my erect penis as it stood before her. I took my hands from her breasts and she spread her legs, allowing my hand to slide along each cheek of her pussy.</p> <p>"That would be nice, wouldn't it?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yes, you're right, your cock will be soft, that would be nice. But, just for tonight I want to feel you inside me!" she added. Then she lowered herself so that her clitoris was at my eye-level. I opened my mouth and her juices flowed down my waiting tongue.</p> <p>I stood up and pushed her forward until she was laying flat on the bed, her head at the end of the bed. As my cock moved downward, brushing her cheek as it touched her lips I moved a half inch toward her. My wife spread her legs, holding one up to the side of the bed, allowing me to press in. Our mouths were back upon each other. My hands found the hem of her dress and slowly lifted it upward, causing her panties to rise even further up her legs so that they could reach her waist. As I could not only touched the waist of the lace as I lifted my hands came to the nape of her tits they were now were bare breasts, first. I slid each of each to the nipples, only.
