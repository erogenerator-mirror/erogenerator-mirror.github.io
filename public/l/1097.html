The two newcomers advanced, therefore, with a certain hesitation,</strong> for each other as the first person behind them. By the end of it the two were only the second two people to be together, both naked and on their own.</p> <p>Even through a window pane, a glimpse of each other through its glass rendered both fully clothed, as they embraced tightly with an unspoken commitment. The first person in a glasshouse seemed slightly shy. He was tall, blonde with blue eyes and a large round nose. When he closed in on her he would not be able to put it out of his mind.</p> <p>She was also rather short for her age and not exceptionally tall. He might say in his slightly intoxicated state, but she had a very pronounced bust, perhaps the size of a small apple. He would have to describe her as plain, while having a few extra pounds on her otherwise he would have been too. Her height would be somewhere between middle and high heels. He might describe her as an Amazonian in the first person though, instead he'd probably end up with an Amazonian in the second.</p> <p>He was quite drunk during his earlier talk with the professor. And if the man had been on the offensive, then she had made his day. Her voice had seemed too soft and sedate. It was the very sound of her voice, even at the end, that reminded him of their earlier walk. It was as if they were walking, but not necessarily walking as one might expect of two people going into a cellar together.</p> <p>He tried to recall the exact moment it had been when their paths had been interrupted and where they were going to start. He was too much in shock from what he had just seen to have any real appreciation for seeing in that darkened room of his own making. As far as he knew, at any moment some sort of an audience would have been at play and certainly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen would have had the most desirable lover there, although that was not what had come to occupy such a short time.</p> <p>If he had not experienced this encounter then his memories would not be the best ones to come to any realization of what had just happened, because, to his surprise, he did feel the slightest urge to touch her when they shared a moment alone, which he did occasionally.</p> <p>A bit over two years ago, on a particularly vivid occasion, she kissed him with the lips of another woman for the first time. His first memory of this moment came when he walked toward her from a dark corner of the cellar and saw the professor standing above her. She smiled at him sweetly and said simply, "Please come in," then disappeared into a corner of the cellar.</p> <p>It took a few seconds for the second person in the room to take over a moment or two before the first person left. He had no such luck.</p> <p>This time it wasn't as if the second person had any power of persuasion or a command. He had been caught in a world of his own, and if that was to be expected he would have found the moment of truth quite hard, unless of course he could have just followed through on those words. As he reached the last row of glasses in the glasshouse, he saw that they were all lined up on one of the two shelves. There, under the glass shelf, was a single, rectangular box with a long, wide-open space cut high for three or four feet across. There, under the far side of the box, there was the glass wall of some sort. The wall was an imitation of the glass above so he could see from a distance, but had no real sense of what it might look like. It was in the far corner of the room, and the one near the floor of the cellar was quite a distance away from the other two. In addition to that there was the wall to one side of the room, and the wall was to the right to the opposite corner of the window wall.</p> <p>He did notice then that he had seen himself on a similar wall, but not so much in the way that a friend had. He was not as good looking there as he had been in the classroom. He had gained a slight improvement during the year following his first year in college and was not so much a disappointment to the school as it had been for him.</p> <p>They had all moved to the floor where no one else occupied it, but still it was very noisy and very crowded. He saw he had a bit of a break in his stride as the student came into the room. He did not see the young woman who entered. He did notice two white faces, one on either side of the desk. Another pair of eyes, both the same color and as a little blue in color, was staring directly at his companion on a white paper she was up, while she was, in the first on a bright red on a paper. He could almost looking at a white was on a red. Both.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>first and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
