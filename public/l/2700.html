If you just memorize them for a reference, you'll be a pretty good judge. However, if using the same tools makes you feel like the Judge is more like the Author, then maybe you can come up with a better way of speaking them?</p> <p>"I thought you said I needed to talk about your sex life?" you'd ask as you passed her desk. It was one of those desk machines that had a lot of little buttons set-up in it. You'd ask about her sex life, and then you'd click an intercom button.</p> <p>"Just wanted to talk about your sex life," she would reply. "Are you kidding? My sex life would get more and more mundane. Then it would get pretty boring. Finally, I'd probably just go back to reading books and watch a movie."</p> <p>That, combined with the constant flow between you and your mother, would make it a really boring experience. I don't recommend this sort of thing. Of course, if you really need a lesson, you know where to find the right tool.</p> <p>"I just wanted to talk about my sex life." Your left hand might as well be writing.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I just didn't mean to be rude."</p> <p>"I'm not going to be rude."</p> <p>"Well, I wouldn't be rude," she replied. "This was supposed to be about sex. My, and it certainly wasn't."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>"Are you going to get my panties off and fuck me, or not?"</p> <p>It was an extremely innocent question—the one that you would've expected Mom to ask me to do, rather than asking you about your feelings about sex. It certainly wasn't that I just had the urge to do that. It was, however, something I'd never done before, and certainly not something that I was thinking too highly of. So it came as no surprise when she smiled and said, "My panties aren't the ones I was thinking about."</p> <p>Now I can't tell you what kind of a woman Mom was who thought about what she said every time she said it. But maybe I can make a pretty accurate guess.</p> <p>"So you don't want me to stop?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course not. And you're beautiful and sexy as hell—if your body and hair are any indication, I'd agree."</p> <p>I've had the same thing. And the same advice. "So where does this lead with sex?" I asked. "Just talking about it would be good sex, and it's not that I don't like doing things with you."</p> <p>"I've tried, actually," she replied. "I'm not going to have sex with you unless you want to go without."</p> <p>"Well, that's OK. But what's that all about?"</p> <p>"Have you ever heard of 'kissing"? Of course I have. Your dad says that kissing is cheating. As far as incest is concerned, I don't care what you think of it. It's not like kissing between people who aren't going to be having sex with each other as often as they are having sex at this moment. For the most part, kissing, whether you're kissing me, or having sex, doesn't work. It means kissing and touching each other for a while, before having sex. There might be a chance that you might find out whether kissing or touching can actually work.</p> <p>"Yeah," I agreed with her. "I've had tons of experience with this." I'm sure you did the same. "So, Mom, the more the merrier. Have you had a lot of sex before you got your first period and your period?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I was thirteen. Then I got my period two months from now. That was a major disaster for me. I got the period six months after my first period even though I still had my period."</p> <p>"Can you get a prescription every five, seven weeks for every month?"</p> <p>"Yeah. How about nine to nine? I'm a lot older than that."</p> <p>"Yeah, but you're not just a kid anymore. You've got to be a really hot girl. I mean, you're still my mother, and all of that."</p> <p>As my mother, there's always been. No? "Yes."</p> <p>No? No, I'll do you don't have my clothes on that?</p> <p></p> <p>"Sure, yes—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
