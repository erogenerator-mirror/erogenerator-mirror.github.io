I am sorry, Ms. Blyton-Santen, I just cannot believe it all. It just happens.'</p> <p>'And now, please be patient, my companion. Just relax...and you can tell me all about your trip, don't you think? I know what you mean. And as I said,' the doctor continued, turning to Oliver, 'If you remember, your friend has just left this class last night. And the last lesson, he said to the class, was, shall we say, 'Pray for guidance, Dr. Maylie; if not, then the next lesson is, 'Don't play with yourself. Just think of it, and be patient. I really hate being a student.'</p> <p>'I don't know why I thought he would be such a good student, when he got a job this summer, and the whole semester he seemed to just happen,' sighed Oliver. 'You might well be right, Ms. Blyton, but I think you can get him to ask you to go to the next class. And by the way, if you have already taken your class, then you can take mine too. By the way, you are wearing a red dress, aren't you? So...did this dress go well? If not, then you will be required to wear a red dress, and go to the next class next period.'</p> <p>'Yes, of course! Just tell me! I can't believe it's so soon! I just got myself a new outfit, now it's all on again.'</p> <p>The Dr. Maylie was so happy with his friend's story! And now he wouldn't have to leave the room for hours at a time. But this was all about school! They were going to see the professor!</p> <p>'And then what?' he asked, while Oliver's mind was going in and out of the back of his head. 'My next class will be after ten. And before we reach it, I want you to do one last thing for me.'</p> <p>Oliver wasn't sure if he wanted to do something. They'd just had sex. Why should it feel bad to do it again? But at the same time, it did feel good. The sensation of Oliver's hard-on at his groin was giving him ideas...what had Peter said that Oliver should not be doing with him?</p> <p>'I...would like to kiss your lips, Ms. Blyton, and thank you for you nice offer.' Oliver whispered.</p> <p>'Sure,' said the doctor, feeling his cock getting ever harder and stiffer, 'And we can do it again, anytime you want, if you just tell me to. It's a big deal. Let's go, okay?'</p> <p>The Dr. Maylie was looking forward to it too. He could just imagine Oliver's face in his crotch, as Oliver was licking his lips as he took off his uniform.</p> <p>That thought made the professor's cock grow even harder, and when Oliver pulled his panties back up with one hand, Oliver took up with the other, and started to finger fuck his vagina.</p> <p>'That's it, baby...that's it.' Oliver whispered.</p> <p>'I love it. It means a lot to me to be able to give you such a good kiss!'</p> <p>Oliver started to move his hips forward as he pushed his hands forward on Oliver's shoulders, and Oliver started to kiss him back passionately.</p> <p>'Oh I thought you didn't care,' groaned Oliver, smiling.</p> <p>'I never, in all our times together, did I ever. I meant everything to have that kiss with you,' continued the doctor, "And now I have my lips on yours again, and for the same reason. There is no reason for this to be as much a mistake as it is. You are not alone, of course, my dear friend...I am all yours.'</p> <p>Oliver had a dreamy look on his face, as he imagined those lips once more.</p> <p>'Do you have something you want from the class, Mr. Maylie? I mean, what would you like me to say about it?'</p> <p>'No, of course not,' said the doctor, "I want to see some things I want to do with the class, and I can't make the classes with just Mr. Maylie. It would be much too hard. I mean, I want a whole team of students to do it, with you. And I don't think you? If I could be a normal class, I want a teacher of you, I won't. I can be that is I what I too—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
