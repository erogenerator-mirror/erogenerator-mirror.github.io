Will this querulousness, this murmuring, this complaining and</h4><p><strong>dissembling never be at an end? What then is it, that troubleth thee? Doth any new thing happen unto thee? What doest thou so wonder at? At the cause, or</strong> cause to displease. At the end, it must be done, without question, without regret. There is no God, no God-men or men, no man, man. It is only nature, by Nature. That is, that which is God, by nature, is the thing which gives mankind its freedom from the constant chaos which it has plagued since time, in the name of human happiness. Nature will give us our freedom in the name of human happiness and happiness and happiness in the name of God, but this is what nature says to us. Nature is not in the least thing to whom we speak and which we seek help.</p> <p>"What is it that you call in your mind, "fess"?" she demanded.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered. "I am what I am, and I am not a boy, for that is not what my parents call me."</p> <p>Now, with my head high, I'm aware that she would like to hold my hands in her, pull them to her sex, and say, "Take hold of your cock—it is beautiful and hard—I want to feel you in me." Then, she would take my penis in her hand, and guide it toward her sex whereupon she would guide it up to the hole that was her clitoris. With the tip of my penis penetrating her vagina and slowly sliding into her until it was pressed against her, she would take it out again, and push in there again to get an even bigger sensation as a lubricant, but she always said it would be better the other way around.</p> <p>"I need you in me, right now," she always said, in her sweetest voice. "Take my virgin hole for you, and fuck me, it is time for you to take it!"</p> <p>So, as I continued to plunge my penis in and out of her sex and into to her, we could hear her words of praise to me as she took my balls in her hand and began to massage them in ways that were foreign to me.</p> <p>"Harder…harder…right there…I can feel it…in here…please…don't come in me."</p> <p>And we did, but in unison as in an instant, while my penis was in the tightest sheath of it's life, as she guided me into her pussy, to which she continued her verbal urging.</p> <p>"Yes…yes…yes…yes, that feels—very good—don't stop—so nice…harder…right there, oh—oh," all the while she kept telling me. When I felt her vagina gripping me as if it was pulling my tongue in deeper, I almost lost it but didn't, in case she took it away.</p> <p>I was about to come. I was about to come in a place I had never been, and so I took a few thrusts of my hips to slow it down and pulled it out as quickly as I could. I was still throbbing hard, and so far inside her I was as hard, and hot as I ever was, because she was milking me so tight that I was sure I would explode any second. It was an erotic sensation.</p> <p>She was right there—her body convulsing, as if she was trying to hold both hands in place on the bed, her legs spread, and I was there too, thrusting to meet her. And then, as I came, I felt one finger on my anus. She said, "Please…put that finger up my ass. I'm on fire."</p> <p>She did. As soon as it entered I heard her say, "That will be too good to keep to one day." And I knew then, then, that I belonged to her. It would just take for ever if she had me. She would do everything she wanted to me to do to me, and more than anything, it would have happened with her and with her alone…she'd always been there for me. Not only that, but for other women too. "I'm yours," she said in my ear, "you will like it as well as any other, you will like how it feels."</p> <p>In the beginning and in the middle we would exchange a deep, passionate kiss, because she told me to do it often. Then she would turn that kiss into a serious kiss, while my penis continued to stay within her. As the kiss went on I'd kiss her, and I would stroke her hair, and her back, and her sides, and her legs, and her face, and that sweet mouth that could make me come and send streams of joy into me. I would kiss her neck, ear, and kiss her mouth, and her eyelids and hands. I would squeeze her body and do all of me with affection.
