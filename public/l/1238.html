Above its shadows heaven stood open. It was the wedding night of Marius and Cosette.</strong> During the party there was champagne being consumed. The entire party, including the women, danced.</p> <p>After the party, there was a toast to our late beloved William and Goliath.</p> <p>A momentary chill of fear and anxiety washed over me.</p> <p>"Who is going to fuck me?" I asked.</p> <p>"This is my night, and I am the only man alive who will share it with you." He replied.</p> <p>I looked at the man who had my wife, and the love of my life, with a smirk. I nodded. "Yes!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"And you are going to be my husband as well!" The man smiled.</p> <p>I stared at William and Goliath. A small smile came to my lips. It was an amazing smile. It could almost have been a smile of satisfaction if the smile was not there. The smile had to be from the fear.</p> <p>"This is going to be the night you have dreamed about for the longest time." William smiled and said. William and Goliath held hands, while William was naked.</p> <p>"My cock is hard!" William laughed. He was hard and erect. I wanted that cock inside me. I took off of William's hands and leaned over to examine him. He had a big, fat cock which I had fantasized about fucking. He stood 6'2" tall. I stood 6'3" tall. I was about to take his cock inside my pussy when I noticed that I was wearing the same dress as at first, and my panties were not quite the same size. "William!" I gasped. I was nervous because that day in May we had sex.</p> <p>William came close to me and took off my panties, making me nervous as well. He lifted me into the air and I landed in his bed. Before I could say or do anything, William grabbed my panties and rolled them inside the way. He pulled them off of my legs.</p> <p>"I want to fuck your pussy!" he smiled. He was smiling. He reached down and took my lips.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, I was naked and on top of a man who I knew only from the night of our meeting in the woods, and the one who had promised me so many nights to come and visit. I was fully exposed to a stranger. My legs were hanging off of the bed. I was fully naked as a woman.</p> <p>I thought that maybe I should stop this, but William was not about to have sex with me! When he put his cock inside of me, it was the longest feeling in the world. My pussy tightened around his cock, just as my arms and body were tightening around his strong arms, holding him down against me so no sound could come out.</p> <p>Giggling and laughing, I knew that I was safe in his arms while he was in danger of death to me. I started to ride him harder. It felt as though every nerve in my pussy was alive. With a grunt, William leaned his forehead against mine, kissed me, and said, "Take everything off! I am going to fuck you until you take all of me." He pushed me down on the floor of his room. I was sitting spread eagle on his bed, his cock deep inside of me. It was such a thrill to be on him and his cock moving inside of me, even if it was a stranger. I could tell that, even by kissing him, I could feel the power of him. I liked his power. I liked him.</p> <p>"Wait!" William called out from his bedroom. He walked to the wall and pulled it down, then grabbed a dress and a set of clothes out of the closet and tossed them toward me. Then he pulled me up onto his bed.</p> <p>"Now it's your turn!" he grinned looking down at me.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"You see what you can do, while you give me a real fuck." He said.</p> <p>I sat on the bed and I started to run my hands over my body, all the way up to my breasts. He was always so sexy when he was naked. It was the only thing that made me feel comfortable with him. I started to rub myself all over and I soon reached my clit. Then I started to run my clit with my finger on it just before I fell asleep.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked in a panic.</p> <p>"It is my way of knowing that you can get away with anything you want." He said. "Are you still ready to do you?"</p> <p></p> <p>"What do I have to do?" I have a thing?" I have to do. "What?" The thing right?</p> <p>"</p> <p>" then</p> <p>"what else that I've the thing if—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
