And now, considering how different this</strong> particular discussion is from all of the others, it was very nice to get to spend a summer's afternoon together.</p> <p>I've told you this: It was hot. I was a bit chilly, but I was still very comfortable. We sat under a tree, drinking cold beers, talking about the same thing: "Duh!" I said. "I was just having a little fun. I'd really enjoy going to my room with you again. Would you?"</p> <p>"We can try," she said brightly. "Would YOU like to have my room to go to?"</p> <p>"I do mean 'try,' right," I said. I was glad it was late, and that I thought at least an hour or two for us.</p> <p>"Sure," she said, and she reached behind her as she stood up. As she began to undress, she said, "And just so you know," she said, "I think I was the only one naked by the time I got to my room," and her little hands undid the buttons of her blouse, and she revealed, to me, her beautiful bosom, to me, her hard pink nipples. Even though she wore only her bra, which had a thin covering of cloth, it looked lovely to any male. For myself, I wanted to see what it would be like to pull her to me.</p> <p>She reached behind her back as she removed her skirt slowly. I had never really had a sexual desire to see a woman's body, much less touch it. I stood and watched, mesmerized by her naked breasts and erect nipples. It was so sexy to see such perfection.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you, Ms. O'Reilly," I said, as the garment slid to the floor. "It's good to see you naked."</p> <p>And so we stood there, her leaning on that tree, her hands on her breasts, looking deeply into each other's eyes, my cock twitching in my pants.</p> <p>"Let's go," she said, and we took the stairs. I found that her bedroom was right where it had been, and the two of us closed the door as she climbed the stairs and we stood in front of each other for several minutes, neither saying anything...</p> <p>I opened my pants and pulled my cock out, and she took it into her mouth.</p> <p>"Your mouth feels so soft," I said, and she smiled, and she licked me, sucked the cock-head, and it seemed like she was going to put her mouth around it, and then she'd have a good time.</p> <p>Then she did something different. She licked the length of my shaft again, her hand rubbing the underside, and she pulled my balls gently, the sack full of balls, and it was so good; no, I was so wet.</p> <p>Then she did the reverse. She began to lick my balls, which were so swollen and hot and full that I knew that she was taking them into hers, and she licked them too.</p> <p>"It's so nice," I said. "I mean, it's so wonderful," and she licked the same ways. Then she licked and sucked my balls, one at a time, and I was moaning and sighing. Then she took my cock-head in her mouth and began to suck, and for the first time in my life, I felt like a woman sucking my cock.</p> <p>Then she pulled me out of her, put my shaft in her cunt and went on sucking me. I had to put my hands flat on her big tits, on the ground, to keep them still. She was moaning and moaning above me, and then she sat on my lap, and as she sucked me, I lifted her legs and put her ankles on one shoulder.</p> <p>She took my cock back in her mouth and I felt her cunt begin to suck it, as she sucked her husband--his semen.</p> <p>And then, as she continued, I felt I could hold back no longer. I pulled her body onto mine, and fucked her hard, as I had fucked my wife, so many years before. She had a terrific orgasm, and she began to cry, but we continued together.</p> <p>I pulled my cock from her cunt and my hand from her hips and she said, "I need you, now. Make love to me."</p> <p>I pulled her legs up over my shoulders and began to lick her there, her sweet cunt, as her husband was eating her. I had wanted to come in her cunt so much, and I was so glad I had done so, and I was going mad--making love to her. I mean, I was going mad with her--I wanted her to make love her, because I wanted to love her and I wanted to do for her, because I was so happy that I wanted her she was for God, for her and, I knewâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
