Well-disposed and</strong> noble. And I do want an extra little boost as a bonus, while they are at work on the rest of them. My heart was racing like a train, and my head hung at just the wrong angle and forlorn. I would have jumped up and down on the bed, if it wasn't for the sound of the door slamming and calling, and the sound of my name, in a voice that was far more breathy, and far more sexy. We had already been fucking like crazy since my second time with a girl, when a very good girl was about to leave town or she would disappear. In fact, my second time. That girl was gorgeous. She was from Sweden. She loved to scream, and she loved to have everything fucked at once. The other girl was not as lucky. She loved cock, and she loved to be touched. And there was someone who was a virgin, and who could do it just like she could. I liked to kiss her, too, but there were a lot of other ways of doing it.</p> <p>The girl was tall and elegant and curvy, and I could imagine her naked in a dark, beautiful room. I like to imagine it was a dark room, too. She was very pretty. Nice lips, but little brown eyes instead. Maybe she was beautiful. Maybe she was an angel.</p> <p>"I like your touch," the girl said, her voice almost in a whisper. "You like when I kiss your lips."</p> <p>"Can I have your fingers?"</p> <p>"No, you can't. You'll kill me, and I'll die with shame." She sounded almost desperate.</p> <p>"I don't believe you. I love your touch. You don't believe me."</p> <p>"I do believe you," she snapped back. "I believe you."</p> <p>"There's really no need for that." They were silent for a time, and then I heard the door opening, and as usual she came out wearing a black corset with lace and trim around the breasts and hips. She unzipped her skirt, letting it fall to the floor. Her panties were dark, so they were a dark, dark g-string, and when it came off, her ass was beautifully rounded and plump. "Come here, sweetie," she murmured to me. "Come lie beside me and feel the touch of my skin."</p> <p>I was going to say yes, but then I remembered the girl, her words were like a whisper in my throat. I said: "Yes."</p> <p>She leaned over me and kissed me. Her hand slid down to touch my cock, running along its length, and then she opened her lips and began to kiss me again. This time, instead of merely kissing me, she put her tongue between my lips. I was suddenly aware of her nipples, standing up like fat, hard pegs on her beautiful full breasts and her hips thrusting against me like a long serpent, and I felt like I was trying to swallow her for a moment.</p> <p>After that, I felt her lips on the top of my head again, and then her hands were on my cheeks, pulling me down toward her. Her tongue pushed against me, and I was suddenly afraid that I had gone and taken her breath away. In truth, my body was straining, and her warm tongue was teasing my cock, and she had my cock under control.</p> <p>"I love that. I love your cock, and I can feel the power you have in me," she said, and she worked her tongue under mine, working it around my lips and against my skin. She pressed into me there, and then she bit me lightly, hard. I knew her bite. Her mouth on my face. The pain of a woman's teeth on a sensitive part of me; no other woman had ever given me this kind of sensation before.</p> <p>It got better, too. The girl took my cock into her mouth when she could get her lips against the head with one hand and then did just that, all the way down to the base and then all the way back up again. The tip was getting deeper into her mouth, and her tongue brushed against the underside where the shaft ended, and she rubbed her tongue along the head, and then up again, and then back down again.</p> <p>She was a skilled and erotic lover, and her movements matched. They weren't as graceful as when she was the last one up, but they were so very, very smooth. I had thought that she loved being licked, but never would she have known that I was so aroused because she was just as talented as she was making me feel.</p> <p>And I knew that she loved to give oral, too. I think I knew that, because she would never let my face have a momentary skin between her legs. When she kissed me and said: "I love to move in such.
