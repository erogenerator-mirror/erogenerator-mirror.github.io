English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER IX — CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY</h4><p><strong>But coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this</strong> thought, for once, came to the fore in terms of the prince's love of his country, and to be honest here, he too was in love with himself.</p> <p>He held her in his arms; pressed them together as one, with her belly against his chest. His hands caressed those firm, plump melons, running down the sides and to the top of her cleavage. He kissed her again.</p> <p>The prince wanted her on his lap, kissing him back. But there was still this other part of him that wanted her on the other side, in his lap.</p> <p>He held him by his neck, and whispered something: "You're too much more important than that."</p> <p>"And too much too," she replied as, indeed, he was.</p> <p>That, along with her words of passion ("I should have a sister like you," she thought), and the way she smiled at his expression, and the way her face was blushing, suggested a bit of good and bad about her as well. But this was the more difficult part, if that is what it meant, to find another person that was as good, or better, and as sweet to him as she was.</p> <p>The prince was aware of his cock rising inside her, and she knew of his hardness, and wondered why. She thought that a man's cock would be more arousing; a better fuck was more arousing. But it had to be the other way; to make love with a person was enough of a turn-on.</p> <p>It was time to do this. It was time to make her love with those that were as good and as sexy to him as she was.</p> <p>They kissed again, this time with greater and greater intensity. She pressed her naked hips against his hard as he held her in his arms; her breath was warm against his cheek. They kissed and kissed, kissing and kissing, until she could not take anymore and opened her mouth and sucked at his tongue, until she could not hold herself, when she broke off, and lay back on the carpet like a marionette.</p> <p>She kissed him for a long time like that, but she took her fingers and caressed them and moved them around her own body, which they did as they were still kissing. She caressed her tits like he did hers, which, if a man's tongue did not touch hers, she was glad to do for him, and let him feel all the feel and to see the softness and hardness with which he was making out with her lips.</p> <p>He took his hand to explore as much of her mouth as he could, as much of her body as he could squeeze, and as much of her fingers in his other hand, and kissed and licked and sucked them. He moved his mouth to her neck and the place her earlobes, where he sucked and nibbled her with kisses and nibbles. He was delighted to feel her flesh so supple and yielding, the smooth firmness and her perfume and the softness of her skin, and let himself slide his hand up to it, to feel the softness of it, and his fingers explored and felt, as hers touched him there and felt him. His own cock, rising by now, was ready to go.</p> <p>He slid the two fingers into her mouth to find her opening, and pushed them around; feeling him there and feeling the hardness of his own cock standing strong and strong and hard. He wanted to feel her lips and tongue on his own; on his own cock; and on his fingers in her mouth. He knew that in his life he had always been able to get his fingers into a woman's mouth; in their sex they could kiss and make out; and in the past he could do many things, but it was so very different; it was a different sort of kissing; it was different than intercourse, and he loved what she was doing to him.</p> <p>He took her hand and led it towards her pussy, first to his mouth, where he took her hand and began to lick herself. He was so pleased to be licking her pussy. She moved his fingers into her mouth, and they kissed, tongues and lips and nipples.</p> <p>Then he took her hand and moved it back down to her mouth where he sucked on her fingers, but made her fingers his, and he felt her wetness there—it was a different kind of wetness, which got more wet when she was like this. "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh," she groaned as his tongue made circles around her stiff nipples.</p> <p>And he did. He licked her tits, and sucked them, and he kissed those too. He pushed her hands to her own, where their together and, where she put her hands slid them down to where they could be on him. There. Her breasts to be as they were. "there: there. In the nipples where—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
