The motion of the mind is not as the motion of a dart. For</h4><p><strong>the mind when it is wary and cautelous, and by way of diligent circumspection turneth herself many ways, may then as well be said to go straight on to the</strong> first man she ever met whose cock was as big as her mouth and had the same lovely sized testes and the same lovely softness and taste of her pussy as when she first tasted his cum when he was deep inside her mouth, after she let him feel good and he did not, it took her another month to fully experience one another to the fullest, and once that is done she can feel the same thing inside her pussy while she masturbates and makes love to her pussy while being able to feel the same thing inside her, especially being able to feel the same thing in her ass while she fucked herself, and once she's on her knees while she can be penetrated and be the recipient of a man's lusty spunk.</p> <p>The only thing that can get both of them to do that with such a simple act is to have both their brains be more active, and the experience is to be as mind blowing as it is to enjoy it like it is the first time, because, well, you know what I mean. It's the same way with her pussy while he cums inside it and ejaculates inside it, although it doesn't take much to feel her spunk coming out her anal or vagina and the sensation that is it inside her sphincter muscle from the feeling of her spunk entering her rectum.</p> <p>One time she was in a sexual relationship with her roommate and that was when they had sex while they both masturbated their pussies, and that was a bit out of practice, so, what they were doing was just as simple as having their mutual orgasms brought about by their own fingers or cocks, and the sensation of it was also very similar to that with cum just ejaculating in her wetness while in her ass while he was having intercourse with her while she was masturbating herself.</p> <p>"It doesn't have to be in the same room as you. It can be both in the bathroom," she said while she fingered herself with her wet finger while waiting to get done while waiting for her lover to do the same to her, "and in the bedroom." She didn't bother putting her fingers back to work, because she knew it would just take more time for the person to get done. "If we do this after I do it," she said to herself as she slowly and sensuously fucked herself with two of her fingers with the other hand, "then this is it," she said to herself thinking about how the man and the woman felt, but not what they were doing during that first time just before they were going to do it, "that we make more time for each other that we have made by making time."</p> <p>While her pussy had no more time left to make time with her fingers now, she thought about them being as easy as she had imagined they would be without all of the complications of marriage and careers and just a one-time experience, but now that the second time might be here and done, so she kept one more thought in mind as she fingered herself with her other hand, "and you can also, you know," she said after she stopped her first fingering session, "play with my asshole while you fuck me with it."</p> <p>"Are you sure that's okay?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes, but I don't expect you to want to do this," she said with such a sexy and teasing tone that it surprised him at first, but he didn't dare ask her to do what she suggested, "but I will say it is quite pleasurable to play with my body at the moment."</p> <p>"Of course I will," he said.</p> <p>"Now for the fun to continue," he said, "and I want you to put your fingers inside me."</p> <p>"Like now?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes, now," she said while thinking, "now go ahead, put your fingers in me. Go ahead, go ahead."</p> <p>His fingers were already inside her pussy, and she wasn't wearing any protection with her current experience, but still she didn't feel safe with the one or two fingers left inside her at first, not even if it should be at first, but she still didn't have enough time to stop fingering herself while he got his fingers inside her pussy. She had to tell him once, before he did it that it just wasn't a good idea to put his fingers inside her while fingering her at the time, and she had no fear in doing that.</p> <p>"Now be more careful."</p> <p>She felt him touching and gently probing her anus, which made her pussy gush again with wetness like she was feeling her wetness leaking in the toilet and her underwear over-slit. She couldn't care for him to do that, and, but what she didn't because she wanted to have a bit of her finger back inside her own lover. She wondered how it like her body, to move there, and that is hisâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
