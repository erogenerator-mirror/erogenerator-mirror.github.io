The moment I had with the ‘phallic device' was when I was watching a series of lesbian orgies. I got on with one of them and fucked both of the girls while she sucked. I also got off on a group of people having sex with each other. I am a member of the ‘sexology' community who is aware of that activity.</p> <p>”What a waste of a good relationship, ’cept in a young man. We can always be in bed and he can get on with the same people again, can’t we?</p> <p>”Yes. . . ”</p> <p>”So…you've not taken your cock out of the pocket of your trousers for long.</p> <p>”No, I haven't. I haven’t tried to.”</p> <p>”Well, we'll see. I don’t have the ‘cock’ to do this stuff, now do we?”</p> <p>”Just to be the fool, is it, if I was to have a threesome with you and Paul?”</p> <p>”That’s a great suggestion, but where would we be? I don’t feel at all comfortable with a threesome, or even with being joined in bed, even if one of either of our partners has a cock. Do you know something I’ve never told James?”</p> <p>This would answer a great many questions and concerns, but this was a conversation about what happened that afternoon at the club. If all this meant that James would get a good fuck on Sunday night and he would not have sex with me. If the two of us had some sort of a threesome that evening, I would have let him have his orgasm, and if I did too, what else?</p> <p>He turned to me, giving me a kiss. “You’re very thoughtful of someone, but it looks like you’ve just come of age, and that it might be a problem to talk to. Can we make the next appointment?”</p> <p>“Oh for goodness sake, yes. I’m in the mood for some fun. I’m not in any position to go around and find anyone.”</p> <p>He gave me a warm, friendly, “Oh yes. . . you’re quite right.” He kissed me again. This man would make very good mates with me. That was his idea.</p> <p>He made the appointment. We had one for lunch the next evening. I told him that was one of my “girls” nights and to be careful if he got in, as I was very busy. I went and put the phone number of the pub in his book.</p> <p>When he arrived, he was accompanied by a table of two couples seated at the very end of the bar. I told him when he made his way up to the bar that I was going to introduce him to many of these people. And for a moment I thought I saw the table of two couples sitting close together, so he joined them.</p> <p>“I’m sure this is one of the ‘girls” nights.”</p> <p>Just a man,” I thought. If he has nothing, it’s nice. It’s not a good situation.</p> <p>“That’s quite a place for a man of his age, perhaps.”</p> <p>There was that moment, as my thoughts ran wild, when the evening progressed and my fantasies played themselves out. My imagination ran wild. I had to have sex with Paul, and I had to make this man cum, in front of my husband. I was on the brink of being on my third orgasm of the evening, just as I had wanted. And what kind of man would I let go with that fantasy of my own? What would be the consequences of doing so, if I let that same fantasy about my husband actually happen?</p> <p>We made our way to the corner of the pub where we were meeting the couple of couples. A man had come up to their table, he and his wife, but I took the opportunity to introduce him to one of the couples. The man was looking very interested, and his wife looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p>“My name’s Brian. You can meet the others who join me here. We’ve just had a couple of shots. You can call them ‘darts”; they will be all right to drink.”</p> <p>It wasn’ble.</p> <p></p> <p>The man and his wife had their wives had just ordered wine. My wife was in a bit of white wine. I had a cocktail.</p> <p>We chug—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
