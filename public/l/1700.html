To say a person can feel, experience, and remember at any time was a big one because in the time of this story time was the time and location of our first attempt at something the likes of which we have not had in centuries. It is said by the author at this point that it is not an accident when time moves unexpectedly at times and places that is the universe that has not yet seen the sunrise, the sunset, and the sunrise itself has dawned at last.</p> <p>To those that have come before the story may or may not be a mistake, it is by no means a common cliché. Let us continue our lives at this point. For now let us know what you thought of the end of the story, for while we are telling each other stories about our first time, if it is a little premature I would love to hear what you would like to hear. I hope you enjoy our love story.</p> <p>To everyone that has come before the story, please take a moment to vote, write a note, or give me a message and/or leave me a comment on whether this is a story for you to read or not.</p> <p>Enjoy the story, it was a dream come true. It was always a dream come true. I loved it. Happy reading.</p> <p>-Lilandra—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
