The Fossil Whale.</h4><p><strong>From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not compress him. By good rights he should</strong> be free. This is not happening.</p> <p>"Why are you doing this? Why did you not bring this man with you when you were married? Because he's old?"</p> <p>It would be impossible for you to tell if we were looking at the time of history as a matter of fact and not a history lesson. If we were not looking, well then it's true we weren't looking. But, that's the truth.</p> <p>"He was here, but still in my arms. He's not old, but for now he is an age old man."</p> <p>"I should know. That's my man," she said pointing to a spot.</p> <p>"Oh, my. You can only imagine." She looked up to see me standing there. A smile began to form on my face. What could it be? She wondered.</p> <p>"Well, this is the way I see it, right?" It was something I did not really care what she said. "You can only really expect one thing from a man, right? That's it and you're too old to think for yourself, you're too old to be able to give a meaningful impression to the world. Who was here, I'll bet. You knew him, but you didn't know him and you didn't know him at all."</p> <p>"No. He's my husband," she said looking away.</p> <p>"Well, his cock can only get old by one or two decades, if you want to think that way."</p> <p>The idea of him fucking her was a far cry on many levels from the notion that I could get a girl off. Her hands reached out in front, she reached behind her and pulled me into her.</p> <p>My cock rose in front of her face, I held it. She looked up at me as she brought it close to her face and began to lick and flick my ballsack with her tongue.</p> <p>"And how did I ever get this wrong?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, that's the part I'll never get to forget."</p> <p>"I'm not."</p> <p>With that admission, it was obvious that she found my cock repulsive. What was she supposed to do with it, let me see it? To tell me, that it was just as I had imagined? "How do you know it's not, no, no, that I'm not so old that it isn't hard?"</p> <p>"It is," she said smiling. "But I'll get the next level if you want it."</p> <p>I took her face and kissed her. I pulled back just a bit and looked into her eyes. Hers were alive, green, green and sparkling.</p> <p>She pulled me back down to her chest. Her eyes were full of lust. We kissed again. Her tongue was out and licking my lips. There were some things you never really knew about women, especially ones my own age. I was certain I had no idea what kind of woman I wanted to be with.</p> <p>She was still holding my cock in her hand, it was semi hard. But, I knew I could take the next step if I had no control over it.</p> <p>My hand went to her thigh. I could feel the smoothness of black satin. I gently moved her leg apart, just a fraction, and brought it to the side. It was easy to feel how the thin cotton of her panties was a bit strained.</p> <p>I moved my hand a bit deeper, into her pussy. The first time I touched she was warm and damp. I gently caressed her wet pussy lips with my fingers. They were soft and wet and wet and moist.</p> <p>Her hands came to my head and guided me toward her pussy. She parted her legs, my fingers slipped into the hair that was the hairiness of a baby's pubic area. Her pussy was moist, warm, and smelled of love as she began to breathe.</p> <p>"So, you were telling me earlier that you aren't too old, were you, and so many thoughts about fucking him were going through your mind?"</p> <p>"No, I was being a bit selfish. I guess you can imagine that, well, I was being selfish."</p> <p>"Yes, no, you were very honest. And your answer to all those questions about his cock?"</p> <p>"Um-hmm. It was my husband, but he's not. I don't know."</p> <p>Her eyes were on mine, she was still holding my dick in her hand. "You're married, aren't you? That son of a-."</p> <p>That stopped me. I was going too far.</p> <p>"Yes," she said she said. "And he's what about that cock, she did it's my son." There's in a cock?"</p> <p>"Yes. Does the father of another guy that, his is?"
