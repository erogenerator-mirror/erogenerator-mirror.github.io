He enjoyed looking across the vast expanse of garden; the garden where no other existence existed. The flowers had been brought in here by water which somehow had not been lost.</p> <p>After a while there was a great noise as a number of garden furniture was being erected on three stages in the front of the garden. There were four large wooden blocks which were built in the center of the garden. There was a large stone dais and stone foundation on which were set pieces of what appeared to be a medieval castle. The wooden stairs came to rest about four steps up from the dais. There were two smaller wooden blocks which had been built out on the lawn which was only slightly larger than the lawns were.</p> <p>A large wooden sign was raised above the steps which led to the second stage which was called the stage entrance. The stage itself was a solid wooden structure similar to that used for a theatre. The stage was built at the top of the dais towards the left hand side by an ornamental arbor. The arbor faced the centre of the stage with the stage floor at the centre. There were two small wooden posts which led to the upper steps which went downwards.</p> <p>"This is my stage entrance which will be the beginning of my next film," said the director of the upcoming film which was the plot of which the film about Jean Valjean had been starring in.</p> <p>"There may be no real reason why that is if our plot has been read but it shall be the film which will be the beginning of the end of my film," the director of the film indicated.</p> <p>"Why not start it now?" Jean Valjean said, "It just takes some time, but I have some spare seconds before I begin shooting. You could use our plot, as it will be more of an improvement than a film," Jean Valjean said suggestively.</p> <p>"I will get up, turn around and face forward," the director said as he stood up and faced his favourite star.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I watch?" Jean Valjean asked coyly.</p> <p>"No, that's okay."</p> <p>After a time of silence for a few moments, Jean Valjean's hand had moved to behind her back and was gently caressing the bottom of her buttocks. He took his hand off of her buttocks, his fingers caressing her buttocks as they moved together and gently parted her buttocks. He could feel the cleft of her buttocks and could not believe that they were so soft and smooth. He could feel that she was a woman. He found her buttocks to be incredibly tight as he played with them. It was as if she was wearing a tight fitting dress or a loose fitting dress.</p> <p>Jean Valjean brought her hand behind and touched her buttocks which were now becoming more visible to him. He could tell that her buttocks were quite firm and firm. He moved his fingers under her skirt and touched her pussy.</p> <p>"You were the first person to enter my film," she breathed, "you're just as handsome in your film as you are in its' end."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"Well, it seems I'm quite the film star and I should be in the movie. Are you ready for the film?"</p> <p>"I am not a big fan of it."</p> <p>Jean Valjean pulled out his cock and moved one of his hands and lifted her arse to push it against her vagina.</p> <p>"It will be better if you do it properly," Jean Valjean had said.</p> <p>"I don't have to be nervous."</p> <p>"And no, no. I don't think you can be a star at film. It will be difficult enough to manage with just a few kisses and licking marks," Jean Valjean replied and started moving his body against hers, moving his penis from side to side rubbing against her moistness and pressing his fingers gently into her vagina.</p> <p>"I'm ready and willing."</p> <p>"And I will watch the film," Jean Valjean said.</p> <p>"Good. I'll put some Vaseline on the back of my dildo to make it easier for me."</p> <p>"It's the same, but we also have some condoms to go with it."</p> <p>"This is where I take back my film. The camera will be pointed straight at me."</p> <p>Jean Valjean started his cock moving along her vagina which was also wet with her lubrication which had made such the lubricating which allowed him to enter her. But he did not enter her, he pushed his cock straight against her vagina. As he pushed his cock into her cunt the lips, Jean Valj felt her vagina tighten around it. It was as if inside her vagina opening and he entered through which made the whole. It had been an experience during him enter his body and in her vagina.
