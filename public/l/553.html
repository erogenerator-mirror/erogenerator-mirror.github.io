At the descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the town past the</strong> cathedral and the river, Pierre dropped to his knees and pulled off his trousers and underwear. He dropped them quickly into a neat corner at his side, then pulled up the covers and turned on the lamp. Then he looked up at the door, which was closed.</p> <p>He was not the only man in love.</p> <p>He turned off the lamp and moved slowly through the room to the bed, where he saw an open bottle of cognac, an elegant silver bowl containing two glasses and a bottle of champagne. He took off his shirt to reveal his body clad only in boxer shorts. He saw the woman who had been so concerned regarding his appearance, still on her back in another corner of the room, her eyes closed. This seemed to make him as hard as his cock and he stood, moving to the bed. He opened the drawer, removing a condom. He rolled it on, enjoying the feel of the velvety latex, not needing it to cover his cock. Then he moved to the foot of the bed and kneeled on it. Then he positioned himself on his sides before taking off the condom. He then slid one hand over his cock and positioned the tip just inside. Then he moved his hand down and guided the end of his cock along the wet lips of her vagina. He felt her warmth around the head, wet and inviting. He pushed gently on her entrance and she spread her legs a little.</p> <p>Her eyes opened and she smiled. Then she closed her legs and her breathing quickened. The sight of him penetrated her made her feel as desirable as he did. When he reached the edge of the bed, he slid the latex over his cock just a little. Then he pushed a little and again the same feeling began. The feel of the condom on him made it easy. Then, still on his side, he moved one hand back to her breast. Then he put another condom on. He wanted to feel the smooth firmness of her nipple with the firm grip of his hand. He moved his hand again to the warmth at the tip of his penis, and pushed it gently into her vagina, making her moan in pleasure.</p> <p>Pierre started to stroke his shaft in a slow rhythm, moving his hand to the base, then stroking the length of his shaft. He started to moan again as his hand found the swollen head. He tried to feel the ridges of his swollen head under his finger, and he found it to be so wet and smooth. He wanted to push on it, to get his penis inside her, but he stopped as he sensed she needed something. Moving his free hand back to her breasts he massaged them. She seemed to like it, the way his hand found the sensitive flesh. The sound of her moan made him want to go harder, to thrust himself inside her, but he resisted.</p> <p>Suddenly she reached out to hold him, but as he stood next to her on the bed she stopped, too nervous. "What is it, Pierre?" she asked, her expression serious. "I really need you to go slower," she said, taking away his hand off her chest. "The bed is a little too thick for just me. I've been watching you all night."</p> <p>She moved her body across the bed until she was lying on it and then, she was kneeling on the mattress on her back, her legs wide and her sex up in the air. "Do you want me?" Then she looked at him with an expression that suggested she wanted him to finish the job.</p> <p>He looked at her, and she nodded her head. Then he moved over her and placed his cock at her entrance.</p> <p>It seemed impossible that he should take his time and slowly slide his cock into her. He had already been in love, but he didn't want to make the girl feel like this, so he just took his time and pushed and took the moment. 'Yes, yes,' she whispered, gripping his shoulders and feeling the warmth of his erection as it entered her. 'Go for it. Go on ... it feels so good, you're not so big ..."</p> <p>When he touched the tip of his cock against her opening, she moaned. "Don't. Not yet," she whispered to him. "There's more to it, don't rush what makes it so wonderful."</p> <p>He wanted to feel the whole of her, but he decided to give her some space. This was part of the process where he started slow and then he picked up the pace as they slowly began to move, building to a speed she had never imagined.</p> <p>"Harder!" she said, not even looking up at him. She raised her legs to his hips and he could not stop at the thrusting into her any further now. She had her body and was taking him deeper inside her. She knew that it would stop every few seconds.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>That the whole body is so far away—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
