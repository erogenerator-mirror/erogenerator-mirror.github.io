In this room, where I'm hiding, and in the middle of a cold night, the soldiers that invaded this man's mind and body, as they said all women to be, and as they say, we just can't get it out of sight.</p> <p>That's why if all my people would allow me to speak to him this way again and again, if I could, I just wouldn't do this. If there was any chance that I could tell him off himself once again, if I could, then this was my chance to start all this shit again and again.</p> <p>And, it's so fucking hot.</p> <p>And fuck, it's such a fucking hot sight.</p> <p>And the way they're talking to me, when I'm hiding behind a shield, I feel like I'm going to lose it.</p> <p>"That's better." Said the leader, as he placed his sword against my throat to stop me from screaming.</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry, kid. Your fellow soldiers are just as bad."</p> <p>While I was trying desperately to suppress the fact that I wasn't scared to die because one of those men was going to kill me after being shot, I couldn't help but gasp into the mic, as it hung from my ear, before he shouted in my ear, "That's it, you're killing time, kid. I'm not finished with you yet. Get the fuck out of the corner of my eye, you fucking creep."</p> <p>As I was trying to get myself together, before he pulled me against him with his arms and started kissing me, I couldn't help but kiss him back. I tried to say it, but I couldn't do it; and, as I tried to say it, it just came out sounding like a scream, only it wasn't an actual scream, as the rest of the words that I was about to say out loud, was already in my mind.</p> <p>As he continued to kiss me, he gently pulled me against him, before taking the mic off his shoulder and kissing me again, as he did in his place, as I did a thousand times before, only this time he had me in the palm of his hand. Then, he took the mic off his back again, and, again, again, he took me as he did, then they took off their masks of their faces, and they took me in a circle of light and air.</p> <p>I was in heaven. I lost all control. He could have killed me, I knew it. But, I wasn't able to think as I had before. And, I was, but for a few minutes, as I was trying to get control of myself, I couldn't. When I opened my eyes, I was looking at two masked butler standing over me with his hands crossed over his head, a smile on his lips, and a large knife sticking out of the side of his pants.</p> <p>"Hello. I'm the soldier that killed the angel in this place with your name painted on it. I hope my name is the right one on the spear." With that, he pointed the knife at my throat before it could start shooting, and, in his left hand, he took out an iron-studded pistol that, if he wanted, could have broken it, but if just to make sure he didn't, he simply placed it onto the table in front of me.</p> <p>"You killed that man, you dumb shit. You made him do this. And, when he finally found out your side of the affair, you made him kill me."</p> <p>I shook my head in disapproval of his actions. I couldn't think at all. Of course I was going to kill him at that moment. He hadn't been shot, had he? So did so many of the soldiers that walked down the hallway to my side of us. I had just left the sword-handed sword out of the way. Howie out of the sword sword, as a soldier that. The best of course. He was the soldiers. So that was the one.
