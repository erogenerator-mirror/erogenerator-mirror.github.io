Remember that all is but opinion, and all opinion depends of the</h4><p><strong>mind. Take thine opinion away, and then as a ship that hath stricken in within the arms and mouth of the harbour, a present calm; all things safe and steady:</strong> to be the centre of an ocean fleet. This is the only way: my pleasure.</p> <p>You want to feel this? You just think of something big. Oh fuck. You want this. The thought of it.</p> <p>Then there are two reasons I am here: a man who has the power to make you think:</p> <p>1. The other reasons are: that's what it is: sex. You want to be a man. You want me to want you to fuck me, and you know that when I'm here, and I'm here, all you need do is fuck me.</p> <p>2. If you are going to be a man: it needs to start somewhere and be done with it. You must be as gentle and sweet as I am in sex. You must be like a man, and even if you refuse, it must be for you alone.</p> <p>As I was saying, that's what it is: sex. I think it is, if you want the sex. It is the sex all men need – and it is me – and by the way, it's the sex. We are just not supposed to have sex. We are only supposed to be in this universe to experience it; to know what it is: for our own sake (at least) and for the sake of the universe, and for the purpose of the universe for us. Sometimes you just need sex: sometimes you need me to have the satisfaction of my own sexuality.</p> <p>You'll ask me whether it's good, but it's never good. I'm your professor, I'm your teacher, and you are my student. What's better – me? The sex thing? Yes. You're going through life making your own decisions. The sex thing is you, and in this society of women you are the most precious of all things, and you need sex.</p> <p>Don't you think you're getting that? Oh yeah, it's the sex thing. You need to have sex. You think you can do it but you don't know how: by fucking.</p> <p>As I have said, there is a catch. You might have thought that a man's pleasure will derive no real pleasure from intercourse, it was quite likely to come in a bad way in the sense of the 'cosile of the world', and as far as I'm concerned that's about as easy as getting knocked on the back of a pickup truck. I know you think I'm going to fuck you, but in my world you'll never know that. I'll fuck you and get it if you need it, but I won't do it if you refuse me the fucking thing.</p> <p>Once you can make a choice, it's not so different from giving the sex thing a try – and with all the free time you have left and a man's time you'll be the first to use, at least with me. But even if you do it, I will be there, and I'll come all the way around, and if the man doesn't love me, he will love me.</p> <p>To me, everything feels like a bad time, and I've made a decision: sex.</p> <p>There is just one thing you must know before you take this chance. If you fuck, you don't get to say that you don't want sex, you don't get to say that you don't have sex. You must never say that you don't want sex, even though you know it to be untrue. It might be true, but if you say that when you fuck, that means you're thinking you've already given into being just that little bit of fun. A man is a man, a man always wants sex, or it's sex. We are supposed to think that we're in love when we fuck: we should love ourselves to love ourselves. But fuck. You're getting that, I tell you. Fuck.</p> <p>There's a good chance it will never be in your book. If you think you can, then there's a good chance that you don't have to fuck. There are plenty of women whose sex life depends on the fact that they have an opportunity that you haven't actually won. You can make the fuck thing a bit of an adventure, if you don't get to know the man.</p> <p>If you are at the mercy of any one of the other women who'd be on your mind at the time, and you don't really have a chance, then it's a nice surprise. No man will cheat on having a woman like me, but it's a good opportunity for some of the men to find some woman for love or a companion, and they might be in love at the moment.</p> <p>It's a good chance. You have a chance. You do as you want to get your cock inside a woman, yes. It's up to be her; if you want some woman.</p> <p>That may be nice, if you want a nice for the sex—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
