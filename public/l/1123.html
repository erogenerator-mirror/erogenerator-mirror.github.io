The passers-by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it, without a</strong> second thought. After all, the garden could be known as a home away from home. The house was home to twenty eight, and thirty two of the world's most exciting people, including her.</p> <p>The year is eighty-six for every century of the last twenty year since the day when she first became a garden.</p> <p>"If you feel like we are heading back on this journey, please just go," the woman said, taking me by the hand and leading me back to the garden where the garden itself was hidden by a tall wall with a low table filled with fruits, vegetables and fresh bread. She leaned over the table while I held a tray of bread and bread with the bread. She said that she was taking care of things for me for a long time, which was very flattering.</p> <p>"This year? But just yesterday...." I said as she turned around to kiss me. She told me that she still loved me the same as she saw earlier, so she also made it easier for me to kiss her back.</p> <p>I moved a few yards away from her, and she said, "Don't be worried, I do love you."</p> <p>She was a bit different from the twenty years or so that we had known each other before. We were both smart in our own ways. She had a good body and knew her body in a very unique way, her breasts were small but had a perfect shape and she had an extremely sexy ass.</p> <p>"I think you're a bit impatient," she whispered. "I can't wait to get started on it." She took my hand to her breast and rubbed the nipple with it. I could see the little mole she had left there, so she took my hand away from her breast and rubbed it gently.</p> <p>"I can't wait until we can fuck," she said.</p> <p>She was lying to me now. I had no idea what she wanted, in any case I was too shy to ask.</p> <p>For the next six months she played her role as one of the gardeners and we enjoyed the garden together, but she knew I was inexperienced and I had to obey her. The time was now approaching and when I reached the age of forty, she told me that she had a little surprise for me. I didn't tell her about it because she would have let me see it, so I didn't bother. The garden was still in danger of being ruined by any leaks due to the fact that most of the gardeners were out of work, most of them had been working at their own jobs for a long time now.</p> <p>We were making a special arrangement where she could do everything and she didn't mind, just like every now and then. The arrangement was that I was to cook the bread for the gardeners while she could clean up the vegetable garden.</p> <p>"But you'll pay for the job," I said.</p> <p>She looked sad and said, "Don't worry. You can do it for free."</p> <p>"I still need your services," I said. "Don't worry, I'll pay for it when I have a whole lot of time left—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
