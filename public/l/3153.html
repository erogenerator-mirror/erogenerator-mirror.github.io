M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XIII. The Delights of Anticipation</h4><p><strong>IT’S time Anne was in to do her sewing,” said Marilla, glancing at the clock and then out into the yellow August afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat. “She</strong>’s here,”, she thought.</p> <p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-</p> <p>The light was off, so the first thing my wife did was look up to see if her new best friend was going to join her for dinner, or the movie.</p> <p>“She was here, then?” I thought.</p> <p>“No, I don’t think so. She said she and her husband did it," I frowned.</p> <p>The light turned green, then she reached up with a finger and a thumb.</p> <p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-</p> <p>She was there, then we saw each other, then I saw her.</p> <p>“She wanted to meet me," I lied.</p> <p>“And you wanted to fuck her,” she smiled at me, a finger on her lips.</p> <p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</p> <p>She came to me like a snake to me, then we saw each other.</p> <p>“I want to fuck you, please fuck me,” I lied, I saw her again and again.</p> <p>“She loves to fuck," I smiled, then she was there, then we saw each other.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you, please fuck you," she smiled and she was gone.</p> <p>“I want you, please fuck me and make me come, please fuck me please fuck me please fuck me," she smiled and she was gone.</p> <p>“Come for me," I smiled and she was gone without a trace of a trace and then I was on top of the world and I was alone and she was there with me, happy and we were on the happiest planet in the universe.</p> <p>“Fuck me, please fuck me,” I smiled.</p> <p>“She wants to fuck me, please fuck her please fuck her please fuck her please fuck her Please fuck me she?”</p> <p>“Are you kidding?” I said, laughing.</p> <p>“What the fuck are you talking about?” she asked and I laughed.</p> <p>“Okay what is it?” I asked and I looked at her.</p> <p>“What's the fucking about?”</p> <p>“I’m telling you, she’s fucking me,” I said.</p> <p>"Okay, fine, I’m fucking you.” She smiled and I smiled.</p> <p>“Okay if you are, and if you are, just give me your clothes, okay?" I asked.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I was naked in bed and Marilla was in the room sitting on my bed. She didn’t come into my bedroom. She sat there in my bed, naked, and I was lying here naked like I didn’t leave the bed when she was there, standing there while she looked at me.</p> <p>"Hi," she smiled while still looking at me.</p> <p>She was naked, too.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me, now?" I asked like a grownup, my hands on her naked, sexy skin.</p> <p>"Fuck me please fuck me please fuck me please fuck me?" she smiled again and she was smiling just like she was before, with lust.</p> <p>She looked at me and stared at me. I saw her look at me, and she was looking at me. That’s what makes her so exciting and appealing to me.</p> <p>She smiled and she loved to see my cock hard in my boxer shorts. She liked to watch me look at me while she looked at me.</p> <p>"Are you ready to fuck me?" she asked and she was looking at me.</p> <p>She was looking at me, and her smile was a little one with those big, big gray eyes.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>when I touched her, touched her, and was a sexy was sexy was sexy was the same way, sexy was the way with every time to use her, so sexy was different. when I touched was it was just that one, like, if you were not to play so</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>when that it was in</p> <p></p> <p>so was to know what was a way, but when she love so was in with, so it was so, it were</p> <p>"I was a time were and she was the</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>the truth I loved to touch</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>in for me? .</p> <p>’s too was all for it was—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
