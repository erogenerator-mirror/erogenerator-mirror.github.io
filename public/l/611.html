Jauntily shifting the</strong> man's trousers with one hand to slip them lower, she found his cock inside of his briefs, hard and thick and perfectly aligned, pointing upwards like a compass needle inside of his boxers. Looking him straight in the eye, eyes locked, she lifted her hand up to hold him tightly against her pussy as he entered her with ease, and in their mutual rhythm, they both moaned deeply when his balls pressed against her. She leaned back, arching her back against the armrest, eyes closed and waiting for the moment he would come. Her dream was coming true.</p> <p>And this had been her most exciting sex since that first night of lust that we began together. After we came to this point, her hand wrapped around his cock and started pumping as she sucked him, and just like his dream, she moaned his name, as his warm come slipped down to her cunt, and he shot his own into her hand. He slid his wetening cock out, and pulled it down toward her pussy as she turned to lean back. With her fingers spread and around the entrance to her honey pot, he leaned forward and began to slip it inside her as she held onto his cock, and he slid more inside and filled her. For both of them, a warm current of love that had taken control of both of their bodies started again.</p> <p>When his come filled her and they looked at each other, it was a first, and he smiled as a beautiful, soft smile broke through his lips. Without thinking, he kissed her on her lips. It's been a very, very long time. He kissed her again on her lips, this time not breaking free from her lips, but parting it with his fingers. As he kissed her, he slid his wet fingers down to her ass and slid his fingers inside of her ass, making her squirm. He pulled his finger out, which she sucked right into her mouth, savoring the flavor and smell.</p> <p>Pulling his hand out, it was only then that he realized that he couldn't go anymore. As she pulled him closer, he sat up a little bit and pulled her towards him for another kiss. She pulled at him again and turned around, putting her knees on the other side of an armchair and laying on her back, hands resting on the back of the furniture that served as the bed. In the position she was in, she pulled him towards her, spreading her legs wide to make room. He slid his arm around to her stomach and pulled his hand up her body, so he could kiss her nipples, moving to do so on the other tit. As his lips went to them, she pulled away slightly and reached for him again, but he stopped her and pulled her back across to the sofa arm, with one arm wrapping the back of the couch. She opened her legs and he knelt between her, facing her.</p> <p>This time, however, he knelt with a bit of awkwardness as he could watch her face as she gazed up at him from her chest to her eyes, as if wanting him so badly. She smiled and pulled her legs up a little more, giving both of his eyes access to her pussy and her tight ass hole. She spread her legs a little, giving him a good look at her clean little hole. Then, he started to slowly slide his cock inside of her, looking at her tight pussy as it swallowed the tip of his cock. She leaned back against the armchair, and let him move all the way inside of her. He kissed the back of her neck, and then moved down to kiss her breasts.</p> <p>She turned her head toward him and they kissed again as his cock slid between her soft wet legs. The kiss was just a short time, but it did wonders for her body. She leaned her head back and closed her eyes, sighing happily as he started to move inside of her. His face was against her neck now as she closed her eyes and moaned, feeling like he had her completely at his mercy. When it seemed like her legs were going to give way and he couldn't hold himself anymore, he leaned his hands down, sliding his wet cock up against her pussy and feeling her slickness. Her breasts were pressing against his chest as he thrust into her again, with both of them moaning at the feel of each others' bodies. For his part, he pulled back from her so she leaned against her seat and reached a hand around to cup one of her breasts, while the other reached down to play with her clit.</p> <p>At least he should really keep an eye on her when she was in this position. The idea of fucking someone's wife while she watched them did a lot to make up his mind. Not to be such carelessness. But to get to feel like one of them on each other's body. It's body. To fuck.</p> <p>It to feel it's pussy while it.</p> <p></p> <p>It to give it.</p> <p>Itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
