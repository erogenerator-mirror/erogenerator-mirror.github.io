Then is the soul as Empedocles doth liken it, like unto a sphere or</h4><p><strong>globe, when she is all of one form and figure: when she neither greedily stretcheth out herself unto anything, nor basely contracts herself, or lies flat and dejected; but shineth</strong>, for she lay there on her back, as if she had been stretched out before the man she was seeking. The woman, by now she lie on her stomach, and the man knelt behind her and began to lick her with his fingers and, as her first lover, did it with one to the other, she began to move back and forth over him, as though to pleasure him.</p> <p>She came quickly: long and loud. It was a rare expression.</p> <p>After that the lovers took a few months to come up with a date. The first man to make an advance was her husband. She felt it was only when he was so much younger than him that she needed him inside her. The second was his friend, and she was in love with him. His second friend was just another young soldier, to fuck her. She felt him on top of her as she was stretched up out. She felt his hands on her breasts, his hands, as though he were caressing her. It was almost as though he wanted to enter her, and come inside her: that felt so good. There is nothing like the feeling of being sexually filled up by a man.</p> <p>On the third night when he was there to fuck her, she didn't even bother to pull the negligee on to cover herself -- she just lay there, with the negligee still on. He came in her, in the middle of the bed. She thought she felt his cock enter her: she knew it must have, as though he had made it. She opened her eyes, looking at him. His face was expressionless. She was not sure what to make of that. He took his clothing off, and went to the door, and came back to the bed. "Are you ready," he said. "Come to the bed."</p> <p>She laid out, on her back, waiting. He came to the bed, pulled her toward him, and kissed her. He was hard. He put his face between her spread legs. She pushed against his tongue, but he pulled away. He climbed on top of her. He moved his body over hers, as if for a ride; in the process, he put his hand beneath her bottom, and started to stroke her anus. He put his arms around her bottom, and said, "Don't move."</p> <p>"No, no," she objected. "I have come all the way here, and I want this." The man looked at her, as if wondering where in the world she may feel right now. The woman was all over him. He began to kiss her breasts. He was hard. He was aroused. He moved over her, between her legs, pushing them to either side of his head. She felt his cock come into contact with her vagina. He pushed it in and out, while she kept her legs spread, so it was easier to do this. She felt herself going into the world of the other. She felt him enter her. She felt the thrusts of his manhood and the sounds of his penis in her vagina, her vagina, as against her clitoris. The woman was in a frenzy, humping herself toward him, in ecstasy, while the man in her vagina took a long hard stroke into her. The thrusts felt different, more intense.</p> <p>It was too much for her: she was writhing and screaming, trying to find some sort of stability with the man that she was being taken. She pulled her legs and arms away from him, and came.</p> <p>After a few minutes, the man in her vagina climbed over her just as she was coming down from her orgasm. He went down on her. And then she felt the first man's penis enter her. He pushed into her again, and started to fuck her. It was different. It was still a strange sensation, but she had the feeling of his penis entering her in a way that was different from him. It was like he just went inside and moved her around.</p> <p>She was in a world of her own now. The rhythm of the couple's strokes was different, with the man moving in her and giving her a break when he had taken her, and thrusting into her. She felt her own climax, and started to push against him. "Oh Yes! Oh, fuck me..." She had never done any such thing before, but she felt her orgasm approaching, and she knew that she would come as she came again, and again.</p> <p>Again, the man behind her started thrusting into her, while the woman kept fucking him with those hips that she was making her hips. She was coming at the head of the bed.</p> <p>As his cock went into her, she came again.</p> <p>The woman got off of him, but kept on top of her husband. He had his penis in her vagina. The man, on top was getting into her, he. in her, his penis. , in her vagina.
