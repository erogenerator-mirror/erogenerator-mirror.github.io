This also, among other things, may serve to keep thee from vainglory;</h4><p><strong>if thou shalt consider, that thou art now altogether incapable of the commendation of one, who all his life long, or from his youth at least, hath lived a philosopher’s</strong> dream."</p> <p>The idea of it felt so good to me, just to feel someone penetrate my asshole. This would be a dream come true!</p> <p>"You know, it would be quite lovely to have someone as a lover as long as she'll be with you. Wouldn't you get bored with her then, having to do, like a servant?"</p> <p>My answer was a slap against my ass. So much of it in fact it almost hurt, even though that was no doubt the case in my current state. I'd be able to do that for a long time.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me, and all this fucking and sucking will be very gentle." I told her.</p> <p>"Yes, that is good, my love," she said, and pushed me off of the couch. "Lie down on your back and do not attempt to resist me. You must be able to do a great deal of fucking."</p> <p>I did. It took a few attempts but I found all of them quite fun. I had to admit it was really quite thrilling.</p> <p>We came as close as possible to the first time, making me sit on the edge of the couch until my hand got on her pussy, sliding a finger up her slit. I tried to push one of my fingers up her, but she pushed me away. She had enough time, and so she did some more of the other stuff.</p> <p>That did it. She was wet, and it didn't take her long before she had me in the middle of her at all the last thing she wanted.</p> <p>I was a bit surprised when she told me to get up there. A moment later she had her knees on my shoulders and had me thrusting in and out of her pussy. She looked like a real goddess with her legs on me and her hand on my cock the whole time.</p> <p>"Do it again," she said, and I did again but soon she was coming. I guess she came for a very long time, and it seemed to me that it was more that she came to me for sex than just having one.</p> <p>I had trouble making it to the third time. Somehow I was able to reach the end, and then she took over again. She looked so happy.</p> <p>We made love three times that day. I had to admit to myself I'd had a great time. It was fantastic. I was surprised after a while that some of my previous orgasms did seem to be lessened but there was still a lot to be felt.</p> <p>She was always so good when she was in charge, in control. I never saw her coming for any reason. All she seemed to do was to put me in a mood, and all her ideas were for her own enjoyment. I had to admire her!</p> <p>Afterward, we cuddled and kissed, then went to the bathroom where we fucked again. That time, the girl on my side sat on my cock, then had my hand holding her pussy lips open. I felt some of that lubricant, which must have been coming in.</p> <p>"Are you ready, darling?" she said, and I nodded, although I could barely see. She pressed down against her lips, which opened easily. That was the main source of her lubricant. I got some from her pussy and rubbed it into her hole and then pressed the head against her. A bit of resistance, but I got it to enter and it passed by and started to move inside of her.</p> <p>"No," she said, "give a little more." She put her hands either side of my legs and pulled me into her. The feeling of our cock touching, and the sensation of a warm, soft pair with a firm, round ass, and a cock being inserted, it was wonderful.</p> <p>We fucked for quite some time. Even though it was very dark, and very still, and she took over the work. We were getting turned on because we were fucking like animals.</p> <p>Then I got my hand under her and pushed the tip into her crack, and found the entrance to her anus. She pushed back and I pushed hard until she had me fully inside of her, then I began to move in and out, with just a short, sharp movement until I was in as deep as I could go before she moved back, giving me access to her hole.</p> <p>I tried my best to be gentle, although I couldn't help being aroused enough that just about anything was possible. She made a little noise, just to hear it, and she didn't seem to mind. She looked at me for a while, then smiled up at me again.</p> <p>"Do not move. You have to go on doing the action." She said it softly. I could hear some of her own words as well.</p> <p>"Ah, yes, do my hand on my cock inside you, ah, yes. Do like the whole inside.
