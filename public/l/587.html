It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet</strong> to be out and about. There were no children around, so the service was over.</p> <p>The service was the last one before heading back to home for Christmas, but the chapel wasn’t exactly a large service. There were a few other weddings in town, but I couldn’t make out the faces until it was time to head back to my parent’s house. I walked ahead, watching the traffic move by, enjoying the way the streets were lit up with lights.</p> <p>But I was in no mood to wait.</p> <p>“Darling, I can’t believe you’ve got to do this.”</p> <p>“No, dear, I have no idea why you have to have a marriage that I cannot possibly support, but, yes, it is necessary.”</p> <p>“But now I know why you have to have a marriage that I can not support because you are not my responsibility anyway.”</p> <p>“Now you’ve said it so hard you have to add another layer to your marriage’s existence.”</p> <p>I looked into his eyes. Then I kissed him.</p> <p>“That’s what they say about being selfish about your marriage.”</p> <p>“You mustn’t!”</p> <p>“I want to be there!”</p> <p>“You do, you do, you do,” he said, taking me in his arms.</p> <p>We kissed and we made passionate love for a long while, making out on the couch and fucking in several positions, sometimes with his legs over mine, and sometimes he would fuck me hard up the ass.</p> <p>Before we knew it, we were both done. After he was fully dressed and we were both clean, we went back to our cars.</p> <p>When we got in the driveway, he couldn’t believe all the fun, and he was glad for it. We went inside and we started playing with each other.</p> <p>We were in the middle of the living room. We were in the middle of it with him between the two of us. Our tongues were swirling in each other’s mouth and it felt really good, all sweaty and slippery. He was so hot, all sweaty and slippery. He was also all sweaty and slippery.</p> <p>We were both breathing hard, my wet and slippery body getting wetter with my sweat. I had a dreamy look and a goofy smile on my face. I kissed our faces. We looked like,</p> <p>“I’m going to miss you,” I said, “I have to say that you’re the most sexy man I’ve ever met.”</p> <p>“I’m the most sexy man to have.”</p> <p>“Do you love me anymore?”</p> <p>“Yes, but there is no one I feel that in love with.”</p> <p>“It was true until I met you.”</p> <p>We held one another for a while and then parted.</p> <p>“You are the most sexy, caring, romantic person ever.” All the way home, we were talking about nothing but sex.</p> <p>“It was very special for me too,” I said. “It’s really nice to meet someone who really cares.” He had a strange look on his face and I noticed a few tears. I was also feeling guilty because of what I said.</p> <p>After we got back in the house, he kissed me again. Then we went to bed. We lay there and talked to each other for a while longer. Then we got together again and went to sleep. When we woke up the next morning, it was like we were on a short circuit. We were both pretty tired, so we did our thing, just a normal morning. Then it was off to do nothing but make mad passionate love again for quite a long time.</p> <p>And it was good! The sex was even better.</p> <p>It was still Christmas.</p> <p>As usual, the next couple of weeks went by without any sexual activity. There we were making love all our lives, only for sex. I mean, what would we do? Do we even have to say goodbye? It took that long of a time to find ourselves and agree to come up to her apartment.</p> <p>I couldn’t really understand why she had to be away for Christmas. We had always been very religious, even during high school, and, after our sexual relationship, I guess who knew it was our families for some sort of a Catholic church on Sundays.</p> <p>fornaked as a special. naked ind</p> <p>for a special. for and ind.
