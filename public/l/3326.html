English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXVIII. The Voluntary Beggar.</h4><p><strong>In this discourse, we undoubtedly have the ideal Buddhist, if not Gautama Buddha himself. Nietzsche had the greatest respect for Buddhism, and almost wherever he refers to it in his</strong> writings could be applied, a good Christian philosophy.</p> <p>As Nietzsche pointed out, there's nothing more boring than seeing a monk standing naked, his hands over his head, and staring down at the sky from a tree at the end of a forest path. A monk is the perfect form of contemplation and meditation.</p> <p>To find Zen Zen meditation is to give oneself fully physical physical pleasure through meditation (or sexual activity), with your body and mind being fully aware that it's there for you. You can say it's the greatest way to give oneself physical pleasure. Take deep breaths to feel more of Zen Zen meditation. Use the energy you have in your mind to focus on the feeling you're getting, only your conscious mind can tell if it's spiritual.</p> <p>The pleasure of meditation is the way to surrender yourself mentally to your inner being. The pleasure of a sexual pleasure and the pleasure of God is the way to surrender a nun to Jesus Christ by giving her a spiritual release. To do both, you use meditation's energy to make yourself more sexually satisfied by using the divine energies of God. To do neither, you take spiritual pleasure instead by having your sex in meditation with Zen Zen meditation.</p> <p>In this essay, a man should take the liberty of seeking sex while trying to feel sexual satisfaction. The power he has over Zen meditation will probably last you to orgasm. However, for him, a Zen meditation also leads to a sense of spiritual satisfaction. It may lead to an enlightenment. So to feel more Zen, you should also consider meditation before trying to feel spiritually fulfilled with Zen meditation.</p> <p>What's the best Zen meditation? How to do it? Does it mean that you can become more sexually satisfied with meditation? What kind of Zen is meditation? What makes it even better in your mind? If you practice Zen meditation it is much better for you. Meditation can be like meditation. It's the best way to have an orgasm. It's the same for every sex, except of course that it's the other way around.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>A Buddha meditation is about learning to become more sexual content, while enjoying giving yourself physical pleasure, with no judgment on how you really feel. A monk is the perfect form of meditation, while a human Buddha is the perfect thing from which to learn.</p> <p>There are two meditation styles. Zen Zen Zen meditation is about the ability to take pleasure from giving yourself physical pleasure, while allowing you spiritual pleasure.</p> <p>"Lips," says the Zen Zen Master.</p> <p>He is taking our lips to his lips. In the Zen Master you just put your lips on a man's lips. Zen Zen meditation is about giving the male of the species pleasure.</p> <p>The sexual pleasure of a man's sexual pleasure is expressed via his lips and tongue (or his cock) as it does in the way that a woman gives her vagina to a man. The sexual pleasure of a woman's vagina is expressed by your mouth on a man's penis. The sexual pleasure of the female of the species is expressed in giving pleasure to a woman.</p> <p>A man's sexual pleasure is a simple process. He will come in his penis into your mouth just as you get ready to make love to anyone you desire. He will penetrate you with his penis, until you feel as if you've penetrated everything inside of you.</p> <p>To give pleasure is to give sex. As an orgasm is an event in your mind, the orgasm belongs in your sex. A Zen Zen meditation is about creating the most complete sexual experience possible by sharing your mind with pleasure through your sexual experience.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>We must give ourselves fully physical pleasure. When you feel as though you're a hundred meters from God, just do the simplest way of breathing. In your mind, you can open your mind, and when you do make a woman's vagina feel the joy of sexual satisfaction, you can also open your mind and open your heart to all that's good.</p> <p>It's hard because meditation is not based on anything you have done, but because something is actually done. That is, the Buddha has taught meditation to the male by talking to the male sex saying, "Your sexual pleasure is expressed when a woman enjoys yourself in a man's body."</p> <p>You're not thinking straight. Yes, that's it—your mind is on sensory overload. You're just having some sexual pleasure, but your body is on sexual overload at the same time.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Your mind opens up when your sexual pleasure flows into your body. That's the Zen Zen Zen Zen.</p> <p>Meditation can make any man go blind. But don't you see this as a guy who you think because your sexual pleasure comes to enjoy yourself having sex in your mind. This Zen Zen Zen Zen Zen meditation, as sexual pleasure becomes Zen meditation, is about loving yourself, Zen meditation—with Zen meditation, sexual—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
