CONTINUATION OF THE KEY TO THE RED DOOR.</h4><p><strong>That night, la Esmeralda had fallen asleep in her cell, full of oblivion, of hope, and of sweet thoughts. She had already been asleep for some time, dreaming as always,</strong> only now... it had only been three hours since the incident in the park. Her fingers had been resting on the headboard, a little sore, her eyes squeezed shut. But she had no regrets. She had given into all her desires, as she gave into her desires of making love every single day. That was how she always found it - how she could always have this dream come true... even in her dreams.</p> <p>At one time, she had been a beautiful, passionate heroine who lived her dream. Then, someone who was not someone she was meant to be. Now... she was a sex queen, taking pleasure in giving pleasure to a stranger. Who knew how she had gotten that sense? Maybe she had. Maybe she really did have. At least she had. And if it were true, surely there was a way to be truly beautiful if you had the chance to be sexy and exciting and irresistible. It was that simple. But who knew? Maybe the whole thing could be a dream, or perhaps she just had a vivid memory of her former life in life, a happy memory of a happy memory as one of her lovers. But it had been an event. It was over, or maybe it had never happened. Who knows? Maybe it had always been just a fantasy to actually be a sex queen. But now... now it was reality...</p> <p>It was all so surreal and good, so perfect, so good. She had dreamed of having those dreams a thousand years ago. She had known that what she did in real life was a great dream, just like any other one of her fantasies. Even though her life had started out this way, she had been in constant dreams of doing that with a stranger. Ever since having sex, she had dreamed of being in another's body, of the pleasure she shared with another man. Of having other's cum in her mouth. Of having her orgasms and orgasms from one man's cumming inside her body. Of fucking her boyfriends in front of other girls in front of men, her pussy being fucked by another man at that moment. It had never happened, even in her dreams. She had never been in an orgasm with another man, except that she had thought of being with one while imagining she was having an orgasm in a lesbian club.</p> <p>And now... she was in her fantasy world. It was now all for real, so real that she could almost call it experienceâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
