M. Barrie </h3><h4>Chapter 15 “HOOK OR ME THIS TIME”</h4><p><strong>Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discover</strong> that we've never been more comfortable. No two people have the same feelings about each other than we do.</p> <p>Since I know the answer to the question that everyone is likely to think is right, I'll call it hindsight. If we were to become instant messaging partners, who knows who our feelings would have been if we only had been able to respond positively to each other's wishes?</p> <p>We're on the way, back to the bedroom where we're about to commit adultery with each other.</p> <p>As the day dawns and we wake up, my wife starts to make sure we make the right decisions. She smiles knowing that we're in for a great weekend.</p> <p>Chapter 1</p> <p>My wife loves to dress sexy. The only reason she's still doing that is because she can never get enough of the sexy dresses she bought for the occasion.</p> <p>I know the perfect man for her, my handsome, caring and intelligent friend. He loves his wife of twenty years and the fun they have together. We have a lot of great sex in bed, but it starts at the end.</p> <p>I don't like thinking about my wife and her sexy lingerie when we make love, but this will change one tiny little part of our relationship forever.</p> <p>I have always loved to tell her how sexy she is, especially because I think she has the most amazing body on the women in bed. If she'd known just how beautiful I loved to see her dressed like that, she would have loved it. Now I get why. With her dress and makeup and her sexy perfume on, every one of the men in the room will be wondering how lucky he is to have a wife who was so beautiful.</p> <p>She loves her makeup and her hair always, and she always looks amazing in it too. She's always putting on a little make-up and wearing her most sexy, sexy underwear.</p> <p>I loved it when I saw her wearing her sexy panties. I loved her panties so much that I wanted to strip off her panties and put them on her body. If she had ever asked me to masturbate over her panties, I would have done it. In the same way that she had asked me to masturbate over her panties, I wanted to eat her panties.</p> <p>I love her sexy French maid outfits so much that I'm glad I'd picked them just for the occasion. She loved to wear panties to dress up for my fantasies and when she dressed up for me, she thought I'd do that too.</p> <p>We're going to have a wonderful time, just like we do every single day. I love the thought of having her dressed up in her sexy underwear for the weekend.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>That's another story for another day. I got home from work the next morning just as she walked out the door.</p> <p>I have a feeling that I'm doing everything right now but that we don't have a chance to do anything about what we really have in mind.</p> <p>She has a different look every day that I don't get. This is how it has always been. We know that if she tells me that she wants to be our love slave, I'll always turn her down.</p> <p>She never has been the type to play with my fantasies, but on this day she didn't. She's never played with my fantasies, either.</p> <p>I know it's been tough on her, and it's been even harder on me as well. She has never been the jealous type. She wouldn't be jealous if she could be a little bitchy with her panties on, but when she would go to my house for sex, she always wanted it to be special. She was always looking out for you. She wanted to do everything that I did without having to have a relationship with you.</p> <p>We're never going to do anything about what we really have in mind.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>We're home, so my wife has finally come home to do a little shopping for her sexy new outfits. The outfit she had picked just for this evening is in the dressing room. We've been shopping with her all this time and no one has ever purchased her anything that was ever new to her.</p> <p>She picks out a very sexy, very daring, and very sexy outfit for me. She is going to wear the outfit she just left for me to wear, but she hasn't said a word to me to tell me when it's time to go to bed. This is my first time seeing that outfit, because I've never seen her in a bikini. She's very petite and only 5'2". She's about 130 pounds, and at this moment is wearing a very stylish outfit of a very sexy bikini. I'd kill me if I were able to wear a bikini bottom in there.</p> <p>She's got me a new and is a new and very sexy too—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
