In the evening the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought rain first, and</strong> then I could think of nothing else.</p> <p>That evening, my wife and I arrived at the local restaurant. It was 7am, and the food was outstanding. My wife and I sat together at a small table on the patio by the pool - near the back of the house. We drank some wine and relaxed.</p> <p>My wife, Karen, and I looked across the table at each other and smiled. I knew she and Bob had been up a whole night watching porn together, and knew we'd had our share too.</p> <p>"Happy New Year!" Karen declared, and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"Thank you", I mumbled to her.</p> <p>I knew my wife and Bob had fucked; at least that's what you'd think, especially from Bob's viewpoint. For my part, I'd gone down on Karen after she sucked my cock...or he'd fucked me when we were younger...and watched porn in a nearby hotel room. I wasn't quite sure that he'd made it in me; I'd been so horny for Karen that I didn't actually have a condom in me. But I did know that the sight of my wonderful wife with another man's cum running out of her pussy as Bob fucked her senseless, or watching her eat an audience's cum out of his ass and watch my wife's face contorting into a look of ecstasy, made my cock stand up straight underneath me. But I was too hot to take that risk, and I knew even though Bob had fucked me a year before that he'd be very disappointed whether I was still able to enjoy it as much as he'd told me.</p> <p>As the waiter started to approach Karen's chair next to mine, Karen leaned back against the table, and then she kissed me and pulled me to her. I kissed her mouth; our lips met briefly, and then she pulled me to her. But then she turned me and kissed me too. As we separated, I felt my wife's hand slide across my back; we turned slowly back towards the patio.</p> <p>"I hope we can keep the momentum, honey" Karen whispered. She kissed me again, and I felt Bob's cum run down over my wife's thigh. Then my wife grabbed my wrist; we sat side by side and enjoyed the sensation of the warmth of each other's bodies. And then, Bob, my wife, and Bob's brother returned to the edge of the patio.</p> <p>As the waiter made his way up, I thought we were about to be stopped by the waiter. And I wasn't wrong. As Bob's brother and brother and wife walked by, the door opened, and then closed. Then I was left in the patio.</p> <p>My wife returned to me and kissed me, then said, "My turn with you, bro". And she kissed me again.</p> <p>Karen told Bob to take off his shoes. Then she looked at me and smiled. "I know you'll love his shoes, bro."</p> <p>Karen got down on her knees and kissed me. Then I felt Bob kissing my shoulder, and then my neck, then he kissed me the same way, but not as firmly.</p> <p>Karen and Bob both leaned down and kissed my face and face, and my neck and earlobes. I could feel their hot breath on my earlobes, and I felt the sensation of Bob's warm, wet mouth on my nipple.</p> <p>I could feel the warmth of the other couple's tongues licking the end of my cock, and the thought of them doing the same to me at the same time thrilled me. And I was too far gone to want to say anything else!</p> <p>I felt my wife's warm, soft hand cup my cock. My wife looked up at Bob. He smiled at him, and then kissed his wife, and they switched places. We watched them as they kissed, his hands running over Karen's body.</p> <p>I felt Bob's tongue move across my wife's nipple, and I felt him licking his way down. I felt his hands lift her butt cheeks, and then his fingers slid inside her pussy, finding her clit. Karen moved away, and he smiled down at me as he touched Bob's tongue. They both looked down at us, then they looked at each other with desire in their eyes. They exchanged a long kiss, and then Bob and Karen broke the embrace.</p> <p>"You're not the only one enjoying the show", Karen said.</p> <p>"Yes I am", Bob said. "I think we ought to fuck".</p> <p>"Do you?" I said. "And maybe we should, too," with a gelled mouth, but sexy voice.</p> <p>my wife. the wife the brother said. "if it's your turn", and we will", . I said it's on it and did.
