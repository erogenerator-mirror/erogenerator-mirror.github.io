I was the last living person on campus, so I became the best friend of Mrs. Dean’s daughter.</p> <p>We all went out, I got a job going to the University of California at Christi College, and I got a scholarship to the University of California at Christi College. Mom took me home one night at midnight, I was in bed, sleeping, and I heard Mom talking to her boyfriend’s lover on my TV. I was shocked to find Mr. Dean’s cock buried to the root in my pussy. We started going at it and fucking like mad animals. Mr. Dean got me off three times and I was sure he was ready to go again. His cock was long, maybe eight inches, thick, and strong, and it shot lots of cum before my belly shrunken to nothing and stopped shrinking completely.</p> <p>I didn’t know any different until this very night. I’m a bit of an exhibitionist, and I used my own body to find the most sensitive, private places, and my body was more than capable of finding them. My pussy was swollen and sore and my hands went everywhere, from fingers to toes.</p> <p>I was so nervous and afraid, I didn’t even get the chance to get dressed, or to get my books. I found a note to the Dean’s study and hurried home, getting my books from my bedroom without checking my email. I saw his secretary’s name on his nameplate, and it was Mom. He was a little surprised to see me in my underwear, but he let me wear the dress. I had a nice, long skirt that buttoned up the front, so I went into the office and waited for him to come out. I felt as if he’d been waiting for me all these years.</p> <p>Mom was wearing a nice, tight yellow summer dress that tied at her navel. It had buttons from top to bottom, including some. The whole thing was showing just enough cleavage to excite anyone who wanted to be seen without their clothes. I was wearing stockings from my favorite company, along with a pair of very sheer panties. Mom didn’t say much else as it was all about her.</p> <p>When I got to his study and his chair, he was studying his English assignment. I sat between the two of us and he pulled my skirt up, exposing my naked, sticky thighs.</p> <p>“What are you reading?” he asked.</p> <p>“Not much, that’s all. The subject was sex.” I smiled at him, a little nervously.</p> <p>“Oh, I was hoping we could work something out. I’m bored of the same thing. I think I understand and maybe you would take a page.”</p> <p>“Yeah, you’re right,” I said and I leaned over so he could kiss me better, he really was quite good at that. I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him right back. I felt a little ashamed as I started to unbutton his shirt and we found ourselves kissing so passionately that the world around us seemed brighter.</p> <p>“You can’t imagine how much I like kissing you,” he said. He pushed back my chair. I followed him over to his desk. He sat on the chair and I sat between him and the desk. My skirt was still buttoned up and I had to lean against his legs to get it in place.</p> <p>“You’re right,” I said. “I was hoping Mom would say something,” I pointed out.</p> <p>“I’m sure Mom is glad to hear our story,” and I heard Mom turn the light on in the room.</p> <p>Mom’s boyfriend was studying, and I knew as I looked over at Mom that something was bothering me.</p> <p>“He should be studying,” I said, feeling my face getting red.</p> <p>“Nonsense. You shouldn’t be watching him without him,” she said. “If you were a good boy, you could keep that old man at bay.”</p> <p>“But, I don’t want to be too obvious”</p> <p>I looked back at him. “Well don’t worry. I like how things turn out. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about something,” she said, as she unbuttoned her blouse.</p> <p>“You mean we can work out?’s like right?” he asked Mom.</p> <p></p> <p>“So Dad has“Yeah, well, that” Mom came her blushing all of course, she took off her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
