It was no longer in Emma’s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her sister’s family was</strong> the most memorable time in history for the Elton boys. They were as ready to do as the girls would be to meet with them. Elton thought about it but was too self conscious of his relationship with Emma. All he could do was say 'how was all this possible' and worry about being stuck in his relationship with Emma. He had to think now so he could concentrate. It was so much easier that way.</p> <p>*</p> <p>The twins came walking through a doorway with their luggage. Emma's hand was resting on the doorframe as she let her luggage fall into her arms and hugged them tightly. They hadn't come for a romantic occasion as of yet which meant neither of them were ready to leave the safety of the safety room with Emma. In fact their parents had brought them their home for the first time in as long as Emma had known them. The twins had stayed up all night staying up all night watching Emma sleep. They had spent the last ten minutes hugging and kissing each other between the sound of her singing. Their parents had gone on to sleep too. They had left them there on their way to the airport before the twins were able to leave. They hadn't gone to sleep until late into the night.</p> <p>Emma was now hugging them tightly all the way down to their hips. The twin was wrapped around their waists like a giant. When they came out of the airport the twins' mother hugged them tight. She hugged them to their waists and pushed them back into their father's arms which was draped across the length of their mother's body. Her hand went straight to their father's crotch where his hand was at the very top of her left leg.</p> <p>The twins walked to their father's side and kissed their father on his lips, one kiss was not enough. But they were still connected so each one kissed was not enough. Their lips and tongues started dancing with each other's as if they were dancing with someone else's tongue. The kisses were wild, passionate, and sexual. Emmett could feel the twins' tongues in his ears on his neck and his arms. Then Emma began kissing her way down her father's body. Emma stopped at the top of his chest where Emma's tongue had once again found it's mark.</p> <p>His cock sprang out of his boxers which now made Emma's mouth go straight to it. The twins then had their hands all over themselves. It was Emma that had initiated this incestuous relationship between the twins. It had also become Emma's favorite activity as it had been her favourite. The girls kissed the bulging cock through the boxers which they found themselves to be almost the only clothing covering the twins' bodies.</p> <p>The twins had begun their explorations of each other's sex organs with fingers and tongues.</p> <p>When Emma had placed her tongue on her father's cock she couldn't wait any longer. She took him into her mouth and sucked in the full length of it. He had no problem coming in her mouth. Emma took her time swallowing the first few spurts but as she was swallowing, she could feel the hot salty flavor of semen shoot into her mouth. The twins then took it out of her mouth and began touching, caressing, massaging, and then licking their dad's cock. They brought their fingers together and together took it further inside of her.</p> <p>Emma now knew what Emma was doing and was now loving every minute of it. She loved the feeling of her brother's cock inside of her mouth. She could hear her son moaning and moaning as they worked each other to bring each other off. It became a regular thing in their sex games that afternoon that Emma would lick the cock while her brother would lick that. It was one of their favourite activities.</p> <p>When Emma's lips found his mouth, the twins sucked him inside. They sucked his entire cock. This is something that had always been something that Emma had loved but now her mouth was filled with the most delicious and sexy part of her man. So she licked his cock as the twin suckled her. The twins' tongues did a long, continuous lick at each other's. Then each twin would pause from each lick taking one of the twins' nipples into their mouths and suck hard on it. When they took their mouth away from each other's breasts, the twins switched sides. Now one twin licked Emma's other breast while the other twin took the sister's nipple between her lips and sucked just enough to take her breath away. It got Emma lost in ecstasy. Their lips remained glued close to each other's. Now their tongues were almost dancing.</p> <p>When they were both sucking on the balls of their other twin, the twins suddenly turned around and began kissing each other. Their tongues explored each others mouth over. Their tongues were now were almost at the same as they were. The twins were sucking on the same. It was the tip of the twin twins' lips and part of the other—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
