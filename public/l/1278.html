The Unknown</h4><p><strong>Day, for which Dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes, again dawned. With the first light Dantès resumed his search. Again he climbed the rocky height he</strong> had on the beach in memory of his last day on Earth.</p> <p>Again, his eyes closed as he was already at the first peak. Only now there were no more stars to peer into. Time for more, the momentary shadow cast over by the sun. Then, a shadow entered the sky, passing between his eyes and his lips. He opened his eyes. Slowly, his mouth was pressed against hers, his tongue exploring her sweet mouth. As he tasted her, his tongue moved from her lips to her mouth. And while his hands began massaging her breasts through her gown, he licked between her lips.</p> <p>For more than a few moments, the kiss lasted. The feel of her soft, warm lips rubbing against his lips was unlike any kiss he had ever experienced. The kiss began to deepen, until at last Dantès lips were forced into a frenzy. She tasted of mint, of champagne, of sweat. He could feel a rush of warmth against his body. They were not the same kiss but not the same kiss of others or of ones that had only a brief period between. He knew what this new experience meant but it brought with it a new excitement. She was beautiful. But what should he do? Should he risk falling on his back? Yes, he would.</p> <p>But that was an even risk, compared to what he was now doing. He reached below his hips, around to the front, to where his hands began to explore her body. He wanted so much to see if she was beautiful. He wanted to run his hands against her smooth, slender body. But he could not. His hands were still inside her gown, feeling each fold of her skin. He could not have imagined anything like that. But she was so soft and sweet. And her breath was so sexy.</p> <p>This was indeed the first time that he felt a woman. He wished he could kiss her all over. He wanted so much to taste her, to be inside her. But he feared what would happen, if he should do so? What would happen if he tried to pull away? It felt so wonderful. A deep heat swept through his body and mind. And now it was all over for him.</p> <p>Dantès hands still inside her gown were running on his body. She was moving against his hands and he was feeling the smoothness of her. After a while she was pressing her breasts against his body, against his shirt. Her lips were still exploring his mouth and his eyes were still closed. He could see the lights of the stars above, now flickering, flickering away from them.</p> <p>Dantès hands were roaming along his body: on his neck and shoulders, on his hair, his thighs. He tried to rub his face into her breasts, but they moved away from his face. Then he began squeezing her back. He felt like touching her again, in reality as the feelings were like before.</p> <p>But he could not feel what had been once before. This was real life: his body. What his body looked like. That was impossible. But now he had to try on this world. This beautiful creature, the young man he was with, the love that she had shown to him; could he please himself? Or was this new, so easy, so erotic, so forbidden!</p> <p>He began kissing the small of her back and then felt her fingers start to rub the skin of his stomach. At last he knew. It was her soft hands on his body. He felt his body responding; now his hard cock was pressed against her leg. Dantès hands were now on his head, running up and down his neck. And now he could hold himself with one hand to let her explore his mouth.</p> <p>But the feeling of Dantès fingers against his neck and jaw was different; it was like a shock. He had never felt something like that before. The sudden sensation, if his throat could hold it, would never fade, he thought. In fact, he thought he was ready to burst. Dantès hand was now rubbing against his chest and even his stomach. She was pushing her breasts against him, rubbing himself against her leg. She was feeling his naked body against her; she was playing with his body, touching him, feeling him.</p> <p>Now he knew this woman he had been with for years, the love that his body had held and controlled and gave in to. Dantès hand was rubbing a little too slowly against his body. It felt like she had rubbed a thousand kisses on his body during a dream. He was so happy. He had a special girl like this. She wanted him with everything he had lost, in his body. He had had gone to find her.</p> <p></p> <p>The feeling of her body was different; his breathing became more difficult then like the feeling of his heart. Dant the warmth itself; of his own feeling of—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
