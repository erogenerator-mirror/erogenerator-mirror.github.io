I feel that's wrong, even for people who enjoy fucking. I say 'cunts,' because the word cunt is just not right for me; so, please read my first part.</p> <p>It happened to be one of the best places in the world to enjoy an erotically charged evening, I found the place of pleasure. It was one of the finest in Europe, where sex was in demand. It was also the place of the greatest orgasms. I got to experience sex from a woman and from a man, the sex of a thousand women. I was a virgin, but at the same time I had had an unforgettable experience with the woman of my dreams. The sex of someone who was going to be my first ever, especially at the age of fourteen, I was not sure if I wanted to do that. I wanted to fuck a young man. I was in love with a man. I wanted to fuck him. It would probably be one of the best sexual experiences that I'll ever have.</p> <p>After the memorable event in the theatre, I left the bar for a beer and returned with my date, a man whom I had met, I had enjoyed sex with twice, once in the bar and twice in the car and again in a local park, which was not really a park at all, it was a secluded area and a deserted place; but it wasn't really safe; but I didn't mind being alone with him, so I sat down beside him at a table.</p> <p>While I was alone, my lover moved behind me, unzipped my dress, undid my bra, let it fall down my arms and let it cascade to the floor. He then reached around and touched my boobs, which were hard and erect from the excitement that I just experienced. He touched and squeezed them, and played with my nipples. I let him have me, and he was insistent. He was rubbing his hand over my cunt, which is still wet from our previous sexual escapades. He had to know that I was fully aroused. Then he touched my pussy by licking and sucking on it. I had already had a lot of orgasms and came twice or better, but he didn't mind that because a second orgasm was not far away. I enjoyed every second of it. I knew that I would have to wait very carefully, and I knew that if I was to come by the right kind of action, my man would fuck me as well. That I could let go by myself.</p> <p>He asked me to kiss him, and I did. He was a tall man in his early thirties, with a nice but not very large bulge, and a lot of wrinkles which were due to his age whereas I had always known to be healthy. He was, in a word, sexy. We kissed briefly. I wanted something more, something more of a sexual encounter. I wanted to put one's cunt, and his, and my lover's, into a passionate, passionate, lesbian action. And it was not long before we both climaxed, I was so excited by this, and I was also enjoying it.</p> <p>He was not satisfied, which was understandable, due to my having already had another orgasm so far. It was still a bit later that he removed his trousers to expose the stiff erection at its tip. I knew that he loved to take off every article of female clothes after sex. I had already seen so much: the nakedness of the woman, the smoothness of the skin, the texture of the body. And at that moment I wanted to know something more. He wanted to see me naked, to touch me, to kiss me. I had never done that before, but even in the past years I enjoyed doing this in a public place; I always liked to do that. Now, in front of him I was excited and aroused; I had already orgasmed once. He also wanted to see me naked, and I had to admit to myself that as well a little while longer; I was ready to be taken to the stage, I had to have a man, to make love to a man, to be fucked by the cock, to see, to feel, to be fucked by a man. I did not have any doubts whether I wanted that.</p> <p>I was ready to put his cock into my mouth. I could hardly take the knob in my mouth when I had my first experience with his size. I knew that the best way to do such things would be to take the whole thing in my mouth and hold it, but to do so for a long and long time I needed to put it somewhere in both my mouth and my pussy. Then I would put it in my lover's body and take his. My love. I felt he wouldn't mind. After the thought about it I really about it in my own mind.
