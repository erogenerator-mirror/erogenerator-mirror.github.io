It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to</h4><p><strong>consider what they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits and voices, honour and credit do proceed: as also what it is to die, and how if a</strong> man lives to be dead. They, the universe and its inhabitants, are made to die, the world to go, on and live.</p> <p>I had been a kid and had not had sex in quite a while; only having had sex when I was fifteen and I was still in college. And then there I was. I did not have the courage to do what I did. Now I am no better. I had only once in my whole life in that school, in an even more innocent way than it was. I had been eighteen too. Now it was not only a new man or woman but I had just found a new man who would be the father of my entire future. He had told me to have sex with him. I had looked into the eyes of a man on the screen and asked for a date. He had hesitated on the word, so it meant a lot when he replied. He was waiting for me on the couch. I asked him to undress and I touched his cock once; and he said he wanted a repeat performance. I hesitated, but he said he would come over and fuck me. I could not believe how stupid and wrong a man he had been. He went to the bedroom and came in close to me. All he did was lay his body against mine, and pressed his mouth against me. We kissed some more, and then it was time for him to get his pants off, so I took them off in order for him to come fuck me. As I was just a schoolgirl doing homework I was not the only person naked on his bed.</p> <p>He was big, and I was wet already as he lay on his stomach, I was on top of him and we could have been in a sixty-nine, me on top of him, and he inside of me. We both enjoyed the sensation of having a big cock inside of me. So we continued to go for it. His fingers entered my pussy and pushed inside my lips and inside of my cunt. We began to fuck. We continued like that until the inevitable came, and then we came.</p> <p>He lay on his back with me on top of him, and he held me close to him. He kissed my forehead and whispered to me:</p> <p>"I'll come back to our bed, with you, my love."</p> <p>But I did not know where it would end up. I was lying on him again, just a man on the bed, with his cock still inside of me. I looked at it again and it was a man of God, and there was another man inside of me, with the same experience. I could feel that I would have been fucked by the same man and I had done it to him. I had given him the most pleasure that I knew what it meant to be a woman. He was not a virgin anymore and he was so good. Our ages have been different, but it does not mean we will be lovers. We will be good friendsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
