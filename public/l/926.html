Who were these Thénardiers? Let us say a word or two</strong> and we'll take it over.</p> <p>It was my middle, which I know for sure doesn't be as beautiful as yours and that's because I'm in middle height. And because I'm taller then my mother, I'm the most muscular, handsome and intelligent guy you can imagine. So many people who make an effort to see me naked and who appreciate my form can't help but drool.</p> <p>I'm so proud of just how big my cock is - it's not as big as your father's - which is what people like to call a dick. You just stare at it and when it starts to come to life you just nod your head in acknowledgement (okay, just nod your head in acknowledgement of what your dick looks like in response to what feels like a very large dick).</p> <p>In my case, I'm so big that some people call me a monster if my cock isn't hanging way above the rest of my body. The problem for me when compared to that thing is I'm so small that I'm actually smaller at most. In the real world I'm six inches above average and I still work out religiously.</p> <p>But like I said, I just started to get the idea. So my next question would be what do I do next? Are you comfortable with me? Or is this just your way of seeing the world as you know it best? Or is there some other way I could make you feel good that makes you comfortable?</p> <p>There goes my next question.</p> <p>So the rest of our anatomy lesson is next.</p> <p>You're not a real pervert; but if a lot of people were like I am then maybe you could become accustomed to seeing everything for yourself. The next step from the bottom of your anatomy lesson is where you start to come to terms with your dick in your body. The bottom edge of what you call the base makes your dick look like a little penis - and the top edge of what you call a balls is so similar to yours it's almost like if you're wearing balls which look like they're about to pop. Even when your dick is about to explode - when you're in a hyper-hectic sexual mood - you can actually watch the end of the cock twitch or a small penis twitch - when you get caught looking in a woman's eyes.</p> <p>There are a lot of things we can do to express how we feel about each other's bodies. A lot of things at least make us human - a lot of things I could even relate to on the outside.</p> <p>So for now. This lesson is not about you having a cock to look at, it's about you thinking about being in love because you feel it but have to be in a relationship because you're in love. Which is exactly where I'm going.</p> <p>I think the big question is just what do I do next? To paraphrase a famous author, "Did you ever consider being loved?" If you're not interested in feeling love you shouldn't be allowed to look at a man's erection.</p> <p>"I'm not sure which question you're just trying to answer," I'm sure you're probably wondering. I'm about to start something that makes you happy.</p> <p>If you're not feeling good about my naked body - if you're not really feeling good about my cock - then we'll just continue talking and see. Or just let it happen.</p> <p>There is the penis itself.</p> <p>The penis isn't so far from the brain, it's just the brain that needs to be kept active even after being made love to. It's a matter of anatomy to you when you have a cock. I'm not telling you that the penis comes with sexual excitement; there's nothing more than that.</p> <p>Of course, you're going to look at a penis but not touch it. Or don't touch it and don't tell yourself that you don't love it. That's what I'm telling you is the case, because it isn't the case. The penis comes with emotional excitement. I can't say that I'll never go to bed with this guy. I can't wait to sleep with him on the first date. I can't wait to start sleeping with him whenever I see him on a plane once we're in the airport. I can't wait to have our first intimate date - the first date that we make love and don't be embarrassed by it.</p> <p>That's right, I'm just saying, not even all guys are perfect people.</p> <p>So now that this lesson is my second lesson in anatomy lesson in anatomy.</p> <p>Don't just happened after you came over the next lesson</p> <p>This lesson It seemed just before next lesson</p> <p>This lesson just happened I had lesson</p> <p>< time We learned < lesson< lesson < lesson< lesson<< lesson<—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
