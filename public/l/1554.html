English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER VI</h4><p><strong>Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about it. A</strong> whole evening that I had never, in my entire life ever imagined could happen in a lifetime.</p> <p>As soon as the car arrived in the city's underground garage, I opened it and we drove to the nearest corner restaurant for a quick walk down to Raskolnikov. I knew that Lizaveta was very hungry. The whole evening was really good without her. A few glasses of wine turned into a few glasses of vodka and a joint. She was always good at that.</p> <p>We had an amazing time getting into the car. We were both so excited to see Raskolnikov again but the way Lizaveta made the journey in her own little car, and especially the way she had already made the ride in her own little car in front of Raskolnikov, made me want to be even closer.</p> <p>Just before we got to the restaurant, we stopped in front of an old-fashioned looking building. It was an old structure that had been in use until the 1950's. Then, in the year 1950, it was just one of a series of buildings on a dirt road leading off of it. At the end, there was a small concrete slab with a cement floor.</p> <p>We entered the large main building, and Lizaveta went directly over to the old wooden door. We stood at the open door and she knocked. After a few seconds, she stepped inside and went to her own room.</p> <p>A few seconds later, she returned. We walked back downstairs until we were almost to her room. We had the same floor plan for an apartment complex next to them, just with an apartment across from it. Raskolnikov was in apartment #1 and, while we were both about her age, she appeared to be just a little younger than us.</p> <p>She opened the door to her room and invited us into the spacious room, then closed the door again. She was in just a bathrobe. She turned on the light and we stepped into her room.</p> <p>"This is my room," she said as she turned off the lights. "It was here as a kid so you'd have to go through this room, I'm afraid."</p> <p>"I didn't realize I had an AC AC AC AC AC AC AC AC AC AC AC AC AC AC AC" I said, not really caring what my English was on the lines, but just feeling happy for her. That room had always been in the hotel's library. Now it was in a small apartment of hers.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, as she turned off the light and closed her door again. "This is my room, too," she said, extending her hand. "We can start to do this here."</p> <p>The feeling of freedom was very, very pleasant.</p> <p>We followed her to her bed and started to undress her. Just the sight of her walking toward the bed was wonderful. I was already hard and she was still wearing her robe. She walked across the room to the bed. She turned to face me and asked me to take out my cock a moment. I did so while lying face up on the bed. She was naked and she moved closer to me in a very provocative manner.</p> <p>"Suck my nipples, please," she said, bending over and sticking her ass in the air, making my dick slide between her full breasts. "I like the sensation of them as I get myself hard," she said, reaching a finger down between her legs to show me how wet she was.</p> <p>I moved into her and she closed her legs on me. For some reason, I could not resist but to kiss my way further up her soft body, to her nipples. When I came to her nipple, I was really horny, she noticed.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like them too much, because I like to feel you suck them, too," she said. She reached over and started to finger herself. "I love when you do that. It's so sensual, so sexy."</p> <p>Her moans of enjoyment were pretty loud. I was not really concerned about her noise, though I could have sworn that I heard something.</p> <p>She pulled on her nipples hard with her hands and rubbed them as she opened her legs. I took off my pants and underwear and got on all the fours on top of her.</p> <p>"That's it," she said. I couldn't see her head just below my shoulder, as she was very aroused. "Suck them really good, baby."</p> <p>I was sucking her nipple very well, because her hands were playing with her pussy. I was trying to bring her to make me to orgasm. Finally, she moved my body up. Just a little orgasm. When her climax. It was not really mattered but was important she did, though. "I need to cum and I had to make it, to my body and I shouldâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
