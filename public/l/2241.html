Once he was satisfied at the same time he was licking, nibbling, and sucking each and every one, I lifted his head up and told him, "I want to kiss you all over!"</p> <p>He smiled at me, looking about and seeing the wood-and-glass, and was gratified by the way that I had been able to tell his body language, all of our movements, and everything, had that "feel" of a true lover's touch that he had shown me. I could hear a sound that was a sigh or sigh or sigh...and he did.</p> <p>The bed was still, but my hand was moving down to rub myself, to be rubbed, to be felt, as I was doing, and that wonderful voice of his began moaning, "Oooooh, yeah...mmm, oooooh...mmmm, yeah...mmm...!"</p> <p>Now that it was happening, he was moving his hand down from my leg to my crotch, and with that he had pushed my leg even farther up the bed, giving him a full view of me, including my face, my body, and parts of it.</p> <p>Now I felt his fingers against my pussy, working their way under my ass-hole and up to my pussy hole, and then pulling aside those lips, as his lips nibbled and sucked and kissed my pussy-lips, until he took his mouth from my cunt to say, "You taste incredible, you're so fucking sweet—mmmm, yeah, yeah, your pussy's so sweet, you're so fucking sweet..."</p> <p>He then moved forward in bed, and kissed and licked my breasts until all was said and done, and began rolling my nipples between his thumbs and forefingers. They were so hard and distended that it took both his hands to work them off of my chest and stomach. And then he took them straight down to my pussy—and he began to kiss and lick my entire body as he had my tits.</p> <p>While he was doing this, his mouth left my breasts and went on to my tummy and then began to suck and tongue each and every one of my abs as I lay there in total surrender to his lips and tongue.</p> <p>I lay there, enjoying being worshipped and kissed for what seemed like hours to me, with the lights on—and the smell of my pussy filling this little cavern—until he suddenly went soft. He was on top of me, and that mouth was on me; he had kissed and tongued me and fingered me, and he then was pushing his cock into me. In that moment I realized how truly good it was—how wonderful it was, just to be him, and not just to be able to feel and feel what he did to me.</p> <p>Oh, how he made me feel.</p> <p>But it was also his cock entering me, that lovely hard and hot piece of meat penetrating me, filling me. That marvelous feeling of having him enter me, filling me and fulfilling me. His hot, hard and rigid cock began to move in me again, and my cunt was on fire, as the feel of him, his weight on me, the sound of his cock sliding in me, sliding in me, filling me, fucking me, filling me full of him, began to feel like no one had ever done...that it was all for me, that I was his. The feel of him, the feel of him filling me, pushing against me, pressing in me.</p> <p>My body was trembling in passion with one being being all encompassing and all encompassing him in me, and I was moaning and moaning and groaning and loving every second of him being in me, because I could actually feel it, feel every part of him inside of me, being in me, being in me.</p> <p>In that moment, the sound of him, the feel of him making me feel so, so wanton, as he fucked me, as I came down from my own orgasmic pleasure, the feel of him. And his cock inside of me, inside of me and inside the body of his cock, his cock, that, that thing, that feeling and feeling, that wonderful cock.</p> <p>* *</p> <p>After a while, as we both began to recover, the next words from my mouth said, "...You want..."</p> <p>"Yes, of course I did. Now I did.</p> <p>"How can you?" " I was now: I know."</p> <p>" I, I do." I mean I know I do know, I knew—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
