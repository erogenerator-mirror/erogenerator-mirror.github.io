For the last three years I have found that I have become, in my eyes a vessel for what I seek in a sailor, who should be called a good man. And I had my moment.</p> <p>I know that I should be the most self assured, most capable, well educated man you can ever hope to meet, but I have become, I have lost a lot of that, but now I can find out how real, I believe that I am, the real thing. I'm a man, I'm proud, honest, and I'm going crazy. My last words to any of you, when I had that meeting with you, were, 'Don't you ever tell anyone that you were fucking my dad', 'Don't I ever tell you that I'm fucking your grandma', 'Don't you ever tell anybody that I'm fucking your grandma', and I will never tell anyone that I am. Thank you. I'll never tell anyone that I am. Thank you all. And I do believe that one of you ladies is going to have a special relationship with your parents who can live here forever until you tell them that I'm their God'.</p> <p>Now that I have had my fill of fucking and having a hard time with all of that, I need some time now to settle down and I need to let go for a while. I can't get enough of what I have to say now, about me. So here I am, sitting here, all alone in a big house for the last five years, wondering what the hell is going on, and how on earth can I tell someone that I am, and I'm still fucking around and fucking around and doing whatever I am doing, and my dad's wife is, well, she has gotten married to her first, and it's been a very long time now.</p> <p>And anyway, how on earth is an old married guy going to live with such a nice couple. And then I suddenly, inexplicably, the worst is about to happen. And as for him, he seems to be in denial; I guess I'll just have to hope that things will get better.</p> <p>He's already got over this; I think he's going to do the same. But it still would be nice, wouldn't it? That kind of thing, no? It could be nice. And there's nothing to be more honest and open about than that kind of thing. I mean, I could be telling him, because, the one thing that I think about that gets to me, is how hard is it to find someone that I want to spend the rest of my life with. It's just always been something that has been missing since those days. I can't stand to talk about it with anybody else; there are other things that really have to be done, and, after all that, I just can't do it with someone from other than my family—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
