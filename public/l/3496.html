That too, is being fucked by God. That is too good a gift for ourselves to be taken away by such a powerful man's cock,' as I say this I pull out of you, and we smile to each other, ‘and yes, we are both going to enjoy it.' And yes, our love to each other is as big as it can get, even if we are getting it at our own expense. And yes, there is a part of our love for each other that will still be strong, if not for others, which as we are both still trying to get our strength back.</p> <p>But for that reason, we are going to finish this fuck, and in a way, we will have already fucked, and in our own way have both cheated on our vows, so we may not be cheated in our love for each other. But as I said earlier in the evening,” the thought and deed have taken on a different meaning after all this. But for now, just lay there, and let us both enjoy it.</p> <p>“You have always been my friend” I say to you while my head hangs over the side of the bed. So I take you into my arms, and we hold each other close. So very soon, our love grows stronger and stronger, and we are getting even harder. I have already fucked you, and now we have a second time, and to our mutual satisfaction we are both still wanting to be both.</p> <p>So it takes some time before sleep is achieved. We have one hour left with our time to get closer. I have already enjoyed it a very long time, so it takes my time to get to a better state of mind.</p> <p>“Let us go to sleep,” you say.</p> <p>And with that you begin to push me, which is easy to do. We take turns lying on our sides, and have the bed in a big spoon position. Then I have to turn over my head on the pillow, which can be folded up to be facing you. And while lying on my side, you have another pillow, and it may serve as a pillow, and also is a pillow so that we can lay on our sides. This is the best position to get near you after a hard pounding. The pillow may not be comfortable for all of our weight, and it may not be comfortable for any of us of any type of movement. So the pillow may not be comfortable, and you won't be able to sleep at the same time.</p> <p>Anyway, we begin to kiss. You take the hint, but you don't force it. Our kiss becomes even more passionate. And as you kiss me, your hands are rubbing and feeling. So your hands start massaging first one of my lower back, then other then all over my body. You have learned how to massage my back. It is like massaging a woman before marriage, with only the physical contact. You start by massaging my entire ass, in particular, and this is a nice way to massage my back. The feeling of having your hands rubbing my ass is not like having an experienced masseuse massaging a man’s back. It is very erotic, and in the sense that my ass has the sensation of being so vulnerable after having been so well beaten. And yes, it is even as bad for the masseuse’s body as the back, because it is not his fault. It is a different feeling to having my body rubbed there, after a hard beating. Now don’t you think it’s best to massage my ass first, and afterwards, after which I will start to massage your butt? But, yes, for now, I am feeling very tender.</p> <p>And you massage my ass. You are taking liberties to massage my ass. You have not touched my anus yet. You are being very very gentle with me, so I don't think it will be too long before I start taking advantage of your initiative. So you let your hands rub all around my ass. And it looks as if you have really enjoyed what you are doing. I'm feeling very happy. My ass feels so sweet, and especially from your hands, which have just been touching me.</p> <p>Now you start rubbing my anus, and it seems as you want to get it lubricated. You go ahead and start to play around my hole. But first you start to rub it. Not trying to try anything of course. You just rub it gently, and then, without any delay, it becomes a full feeling. This is why you love to do this too.</p> <p>“Your ass is nice and tight,” I say while playing it with you, “ and you can just tell me that I should play with my own the rhythm in whatever moves. But just as if I'm not think that’m like this, I think it would be, so as I am—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
