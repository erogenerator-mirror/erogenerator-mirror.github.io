For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself;</strong> a new experience for her.</p> <p>That was only natural. She had only been there a month, but it was still good. The first night back she was alone, she had even slept on one of the beds, sleeping right next to the guy who was sleeping in her bed. His cock had been soft after her boyfriends had used it, but the next morning she had been more than a little horny and eager. Then the next day she had been a horny slut who got off, but that was the fun of sleep-talking during night. The next morning, on their way to the toilet, she had managed to rub her hand over his cock a couple times, but she couldn't get it hard, or hard enough, to make it hard enough to stay hard.</p> <p>This one night, she'd been on the pill but she had had to go down on him because he was still too hot. He was hard enough to go inside her and be sure she was tight enough to take his whole cock. He'd fucked her in the middle of the day in an outdoor shower, and after he had taken her again, she'd come home early, dressed in a pair of short shorts and a halter-top and pulled a T-shirt over her tits, her naked tits. Afterwards she'd gone into the bathroom to clean up as she'd been left wanting for hours. That had been the first time she had done it without thinking herself, but she'd gone after it, taking the wet shirt off over her tits for another first. She tried the dry wash, but she didn't need to take it off for anything else. All she needed was a night-cap.</p> <p>Harriet's pussy felt good that night, as her body had been ready for him to fuck her. His cock had been ready to go inside her. Her tongue had been licked, and she'd found herself craving his mouth to kiss it. She'd never been able to forget how hard her boyfriends had fucked her, and how good it felt when he came inside her. Her tits hadn't been touched, but hers were, and she'd found that it made her tits ache. One day she'd decided to put those things right over her face, so she had put them on it. For an evening, she'd gone back into her boyfriends' room to masturbate, but she didn't want anything else to happen just then. She'd had an amazing night, even though it had started out with some bad sex.</p> <p>And she was so ready she couldn't wait to get back in the bedroom that night.</p> <p>At a distance somewhere in her hotel room, in the darkness, she couldn't see where she sat. In there she had taken out her vibrator, turned on and turned on low. Her whole body was naked as she began masturbating, and her mind seemed to picture him fucking her with long, hard strokes, his long cock sliding against her soft, wet pussy walls. She had been so close to orgasm, when she had turned off the vibrator, and had pulled her shorts and panties down around her knees and gone straight to sleep.</p> <p>In her mind she had been ready to fuck him, though she wasn't sure she was really ready for it, because she had been so wet for days, she'd almost thought she was gonna be sore or faint or something. This was so different, so special. She had found she couldn't wait for him and wanted him so bad she just couldn't stop touching herself. She had tried not to, but she'd lost it, and had to stop now.</p> <p>"Harriet," she heard herself say to herself, "I'm sorry, my friend from school is asleep. Can we have just a little privacy?" In her mind she hadn't heard someone call her like a "little girl" or something, and had decided to pretend she was her friend again. She was so much more like her mother now, and was getting a full head of black hair and a large amount of pale skin down her back. Instead of going to sleep to wake her up, she'd been left with the feeling of being so close to him to be. Her boyfriends had been hard all night long, and she could remember his hands all over her body from the last time he'd been with her, and she had done things with him that she'd never done with anyone else.</p> <p>She hadn't had time to consider what she was doing, but it was okay. "Harriet," she whispered, "I said no more touching until tonight."</p> <p>night. It was just the night.</p> <p></p> <p>night.</p> <p>night night night,</p> <p>night.</p> <p>night.</p> <p>for if, night.</p> <p>night, and then. .</p> <p>of.</p> <p>"night</p> <p>. nightsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
