No way, my little home won't be a place to raise his or her family.' Well, I'm not a home for him and his family."</p> <p>Alcinous laughed, "Yeah, but don't let on! You're home to their home; to their kids. You can't possibly do that here."</p> <p>After that, they were home.</p> <p>"So, what should we do tomorrow? Are you willing to do anything?" Alcinous asked while rubbing his hands together.</p> <p>"Hmm...I don't know. Let's go to my old place of assembly."</p> <p>"Oh, I know that's not exactly an option," Alcinous added before pressing him against the nearest door. They kissed, and their tongues made soft squelching noises as they danced back and forth against each other. Without thinking, he wrapped an arm around Alcinous' shoulders and pulled him on top of him so that his body was pressed tightly against hers.</p> <p>"I want to see you, so we can both see each other. I want us to be one. I like seeing you like this." The light touch of their lips on each other brought a smile to Alcinous' lips, which had started to moisten again and was now moistening.</p> <p>She kissed him harder, her tongue sliding into his mouth, entwining with his as they rubbed their bodies together. He gently caressed her breast, and she groaned softly when he tweaked her nipple. He cupped her breast gently in his hand, feeling it's weight, the softness, and even the texture, when he lifted the breast out of her grip. He ran his thumb over the smooth, pink rubbery bud of her nipple while watching Alcinous' face. They continued kissing as he squeezed her breast, feeling its shape and its weight, its firmness, its hardness, and the small, rosy color of her nipple.</p> <p>"You look so beautiful," Alcinous breathed as she wrapped both arms around his neck to pull him further up against her soft curves. She kissed him hard, her lips pressing against his own as their teeth met, and they kissed deeply, passionately, with her tongue probing his mouth for taste.</p> <p>He lifted Alcinous' head and kissed her mouth while he took of her shirt and bra, which he deftly placed across her back. When her pants came off, he pushed her down on the sheets and continued to kiss her as his hands explored her body. His fingertips traced the small, rubbery bud of her navel. They moved down to her abdomen and he knelt on the bed with her so that his knees were on either side of her head. Alcinous held her torso high and she let him continue to kiss her while feeling his skin under his fingertips.</p> <p>"Oh, this feels so good," Alcinous sighed as she felt Alcinous' fingers playing with the tiny hairs of her clitoris. She pulled her panties off, and then spread her legs; she wanted to feel his body against hers as he continued to explore the crease between her legs. He knelt near her sex, and began kissing her as she was holding to the bed.</p> <p>"You know I like this," Alcinous whispered as she brought her legs as high as she could. "I want you to touch me. To take me, please."</p> <p>He was so aroused, and he couldn't even begin to think where to find all of his strength. This is a dream, so he knew he was doomed to get carried away and she to lose the rest of her strength. All of a sudden, his eyes closed and he felt the soft, soft bedding against his naked body as he moved to her, to lay himself over hers. He kissed the top of her vagina, and kissed it softly while pressing his body upward. His face pressed gently into her sex, as her legs squeezed him tighter and pressed more firmly against his face.</p> <p>"Oh, you're so soft. Your skin feels so nice."</p> <p>His lips followed his penis until it was pressed against her pubic bone, which was pushing gently inward against it. He pressed backward against her, rubbing his penis against her pelvis, which rubbed against him in an incredibly pleasant way. He felt her leg move against him, and he opened her vagina, which pressed against him, against her skin. He felt his penis against her vagina against her flesh, feeling her, all skin, she felt his body against him, against her.</p> <p></p> <p>"Ahhnnnnnnn't stop. Stop! Oh, you're feeling me. Stop. Stop it feels so nice. stop." Alcin."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Alcinous.
