Destiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, slowly drew together these two beings, all charged and</strong> ready to meet. Destiny was a girl who'd never been close to anyone before. Starry-eyed and raven-haired, with bright, beautiful golden eyes and ruby-red lips. At the age of twenty-eight, they came to understand exactly what attraction and affection was. So when the time came, they began with a kiss. As they'd had for months.</p> <p>Their lips met.</p> <p>Then they began kissing.</p> <p>Dry-eyed, and still looking in all directions to the world outside, they continued kissing. And they started kissing.</p> <p>Their hands were everywhere, not only in the general vicinity of each other's bodies but also down and around the exposed parts of their bodies in order to get to know each other's sex intimately. The only difference between them was that Destiny's pussy was warm and wet, along with the fingers of Starry-eyes and her nipples so hard they felt like they might cut off. But despite those minor differences, both of them were highly aroused. And they were about to cum.</p> <p>Destiny got on her hands and knees, facing the ground to the wall that separated what they both saw as the last moment. She was on her knees, ass high, while Starry-eyes was kneeling behind her. Their hands caressed each other's asses: both of them rubbing the other's nipples and balls from the base to the tips, their lips occasionally brushing them, as they continued kissing their way up each other's spine. A kiss, if you will, was a parting of the first three fingers that separated the two people they were about to fuck. But that was it. That was not the end.</p> <p>Starry-eyes and Destiny were both panting, and both had the taste of their own sex on their tongues.</p> <p>Starry-eyes got on all fours, and then bent down and presented her ass to the air - a most inviting position for both of them. That was all they could take.</p> <p>They made the first move at the exact moment that they were about to be joined.</p> <p>A tongue slipped between their cheeks and licked them.</p> <p>In moments, their first orgasms crashed and burned through their bodies, their nerves. Both of them were still in awe of how they felt while the other took their breath. Both of them looked as if they might be completely unaware that these feelings were reciprocating. Neither of them knew what to make of them right then, nor how it was possible. But after what seemed like hours and hours, they were just as they'd always been, even if the sensation of their bodies and their minds had not yet been expressed to the actual world.</p> <p>They rolled on the floor, face-to-face, naked and open, together with their breasts hanging in the air. Both bodies were covered with hair, so it had not yet reached the ground outside.</p> <p>As they lay back and gazed into each other's eyes, Starry-eyes was the first to ask a question, once more.</p> <p>"Would you mind if we did that again?" Destiny's deep, brown eyes were on Starry-eyes, looking intently into the eyes of a woman who'd just been with a man... two times!</p> <p>"I don't think there's too much else we can do about that," Destiny responded. "But we can certainly change something or two... so that's something we can try."</p> <p>"We can try!" both agreed happily.</p> <p>And they did. It was their first try... even after they had already begun experimenting. And there was no going back. They could still do it. They were ready to do anything, anything, to try this one again. Even if they did not actually want the chance to be with each other. It just had to happen, though...</p> <p>The morning began exactly the same way Destiny and Starry-eyes had the night before, only now that things had gotten interesting. They made love, and then started making love again. It just happened... again. But it wasn't very difficult. It'd be just the right time.</p> <p>But nothing had happened that time before - that happened even now.</p> <p>Destiny went back to Starry-eyes' side first, as Starry-eyes was doing her best to imitate the other two. Once there, the couple had the best chance of being together again, even if they didn't really want to. It wasn't just the sex, either. The other pair, they did not want to be. But as they kissed and groped, their nipples and clits made contact with each other's body, once again igniting the fuse that was going out in their bodies. And for the universe, too. And it felt as though they just the way it took forever, they took a little.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>They laid their lovemaking they shared their bodies and were together.
