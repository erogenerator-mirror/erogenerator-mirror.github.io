English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>THIRD PART.</h4><p><strong>“Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation, and I look downward because I am exalted. “Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? “He who</strong>'s of us to be crowned”. “We are alike in the same way, but we've come together so quickly. “Don't ever think, he, that you won't be at last found, for there's no such thing as too fast to be found. A man's true love is all encompassing and infinite, and never ever is a word greater on the shores of his life”. “We’re alike because of the way we all feel, he and I, and if we were born in the same room we always feel, like we’ve known each other for months by then, as a man and woman alike, and yet we’re brothers like a couple of brothers, just the same. For one, we all love each other, and we always have. “Yerself and my love for me”. “Yerself and I would feel each others hearts too, and all our souls too, and together we’re more like each other than like us, for both our souls are so much alike.”</p> <p>He smiled again, as the words fell down. “I feel that same thing.”</p> <p>This time it was her turn, but he didn't wait to have an answer. Instead he simply took her gently in his arms, held her close, and kissed. He held her lips against his, as they both enjoyed the first kiss of the day.</p> <p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p> <p>He had her lay flat on a bed, and lay beside of her. She was wearing the robe once again, and he could see how beautiful she was. “Do the ceremony now”. He had waited until yesterday for a better look, so he could see her in all the glorious things he had come to see. He lifted her robe gently off, exposing her naked body.</p> <p>She did the same, and once again, he was amazed to see her body. The long slender body, with small breasts, and flat belly, and round waist, and a tiny waist, with long slim legs. Her legs were perfect, and when she closed them to him they looked as long as his own. Her pussy was very smooth, but he could see just glistening through the lips of her vagina. His mouth was on her, licking her, but was a little distracted by the thought of how much he had missed it. She was so wet and smooth, and he tasted every part of her. Her nipples were as hard as little pebbles, and her small breasts were hefting them with each breath.</p> <p>After a while, he saw that her arms were above her head. He began to kiss, lick, and nibble her breasts all over, taking one nipple between his lips. He sucked it, and she moaned, which encouraged him to go further. Her nipples grew stiffer, and he could feel her pussy growing ever more wet. When he kissed down lower her legs he had noticed that she was so wet as to be clinging to the bedposts, and he wanted to take his time at first, so he wouldn't be too rough on her.</p> <p>He kissed her pussy, then her asshole and finally her thighs and her belly. Licking her everywhere he found the spots. He loved the smells and taste of her. When he got to her stomach and thighs he began to lick her thighs and her pussy lips, as she moaned and cried out her joy. He was glad to see how many times she had cum from his ministrations, and he could tell she had been very vocal. It turned him on knowing that she had cum again, and so he tried to please this wonderful woman by eating her as often as he could.</p> <p>After he had feasted on the best parts of her body for many days, she was begging him to take his belt off. He had waited all night, but eventually he did. He put his pants on, and she helped him with it. As he came to rest in her arms, she was rubbing her breasts across his chest and belly, and he could feel her wetness through the thinness of her robe. She told him to kiss her and lick her, so he kissed her everywhere, everywhere, but not where he wanted to lick or kiss her skin. His mouth was on her breasts too, and she felt his teeth lightly tease her nipples. She was ready to cum again, and she wanted him to make her cum.</p> <p>He lay down beside of her, still wearing his pants, and they drifted off to sleep.</p> <p></p> <p>Sleep <|> <> <> < > <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <><><> <> <><><><> <—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
