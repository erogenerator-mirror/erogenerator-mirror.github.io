For three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home receiving</strong> his usual round of 'How 'bout this'.</p> <p>"I'm going to do it" was Pierre's whispered reply. And it was only then that he thought of the other person he might be having sex with during the session. Her husband's friend Marisol would be there, he was supposed to meet her for lunch. Pierre thought that he and his wife's best friend had shared some of the secrets of the other man's wife, Marisol.</p> <p>His wife did not know her friends would be there in some room waiting to leave.</p> <p>And what if she were there? Would they both get a room that night? How many people would there be in the hotel.</p> <p>This was his ultimate fantasy come true. And it is all he knew how to do.</p> <p>"Pierre I am going to be alone for some time." Pierre said. "I could go to the bathroom. I'll take the walk-in shower, I promise."</p> <p>"Sure".</p> <p>The hotel room was small, but cozy and relaxing. Marisol was in the bathroom, Pierre had a glass and a light drink in hand. She was not wearing any panties.</p> <p>"I am going to take a shower", she said. At first Pierre could only manage to mutter: "Yes please". With great difficulty Pierre replied: "Yes, I'd love for you."</p> <p>"I'll join you in a minute". At first Pierre barely spoke - he really wanted to say it.</p> <p>But she said, "I am completely naked."</p> <p>That was not what Pierre had expected, but it was all he could do to suppress a giggle. He knew his wife was a nudist. He never dreamed she or her husband would ever be the same.</p> <p>With great hesitation Pierre managed to say: "Marisol, can I join you?"</p> <p>Marisol hesitated but knew she would be the one he was going to say: "Yes of course". Then she quickly slipped on a robe.</p> <p>Marisol's naked body did not look so good. But it looked fantastic. Pierre's jaw hung slack.</p> <p>Marisol was a vision of loveliness. Her dark brown hair swept behind her head. She stood there in just her white robe, which accentuated the shape of her hips and butt. At her waist it was a thin black skirt with a low scoop neck to show her toned body. Pierre thought he could make out her nipples poking through the soft mesh of her robe. But for the most part she was naked.</p> <p>When Marisol came out of the bathroom she had thrown the robe on, but left it open in front. She was completely shaved, except for a faint line of hair around her vagina. She stood there, hands on her hips, awaiting Pierre for his decision. He stood there a little uncertain. He had never really had a nude woman on the train, but he did not know if he wanted her as his wife.</p> <p>Marisol said: "We can do it when we get home tonight". With that she stepped on to the small of Pierre's back.</p> <p>"Marisol, this isn't the right moment or the right time. I will not allow things to change. If I were married to a woman I would love him to stay with me for our lives. And if I was married to a man, I would love him to stay with me for a period of time. And if that were not enough, I could even keep him in the room"</p> <p>"I'm sure that can be arranged. We might as well let all this happen."</p> <p>"But I don't want to be alone."</p> <p>Marisol, knowing what Pierre meant, replied: "Just come to the front seat of our taxi." Then she was off.</p> <p>Pierre's heart sank.</p> <p>"Do you mean?" Pierre said slowly.</p> <p>"Yes, I mean you could stay with me for as long as you want".</p> <p>And without further prompting Pierre, who could scarcely believe this sexy woman would accept such an invitation, walked his way to the front seat, where he sat down.</p> <p>Marisol did not even realize that Pierre's heart was pounding. Her naked body still looked wonderful. Then she heard the sound of his zipper being unzipped. "That's a lovely suit, Pierre".</p> <p>And her naked body came into view. She was naked, and her beautiful blond haired womanhood was completely bald. The shape of Marisol's pussy lips was clearly defined inside the slit. The folds and creases of her womanhood showed the inner folds. Marisol had taken her robes off for the occasion this evening. Without them she was naked, she was the beautiful woman of the whole day. Her nakedness of beauty and softness of life was evident. In the beauty of her whole, her heart and her mind made this woman was only served both. She was pureâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
