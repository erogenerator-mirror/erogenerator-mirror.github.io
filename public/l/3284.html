English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter II. The Academic Chairs of Virtue.</h4><p><strong>Almost the whole of this is quite comprehensible. It is a discourse against all those who confound virtue with tameness and smug ease, and who regard as virtuous only that</strong> any woman born with the innate ability of a righteous wife should know when such knowledge is so much to be desired!</p> <p>The day of the party came and the party was the party of the Month! All my party of them included! So we had the most wonderful and the most beautiful party of the most memorable Month. The celebration itself seemed so wonderful and wonderful!</p> <p>That party of the millennium happened to fall upon a party by all the partygoers that was just announced after the party on which the people were all happy and happy. That's when I told Nancy (the first year) about the party idea, "No, I don't think it'll mean she'll never have sex! And a woman as great as the one before me can only climax for a bit."</p> <p>But in spite of all that, I don't think Nancy cared where I came from. "I think it's pretty silly to keep all those people happy with something as meaningless as sex. And of course, I suppose it's good because a woman can't really pleasure herself with nothing to do."</p> <p>There is nothing she can do about this. I mean she's the one who's being a woman. She's the one who gets sex from someone else. Well, I can't say that she's enjoying the party. She's not just enjoying the party. She's enjoying it as I explained it to her. She's enjoying the sexual party, for both the sexual and the sexual activity itself.</p> <p>But of course there is something else. We have a very open love relationship, but we are never without each other, not even after the other person climaxes, no matter what.</p> <p>"Well, the point I'm trying to make here is just because there's something special that will come between us and that something will come between us once her climax is over." I told my wife of twenty-nine years.</p> <p>She looked at me, and replied, "I hope you don't mean there isn't anything but sexual in the coming couple of minutes."</p> <p>I said, "Oh, not that! Of course we will! And I have to admit, even my dear wife will understand, that there's nothing sexual to do, if you will excuse my pun."</p> <p>"That's right. I love you and I love sex. So do I, and if you really love sex, you're in love with me!"</p> <p>As if to reinforce that statement, I added, "And if a woman's climax is coming, I'm not going to let her put that vibrator inside me, just to have her climax with you inside her."</p> <p>Again not needing to say anything, my wife simply nodded her head. She seemed as if she thought there really wouldn't be anything sexier than sex if I climaxed with her. It wouldn't be any sexier than getting me to climax with her vibrator, or masturbating me with the vibrator while we watched a movie while she masturbated while I masturbated her. It was actually kind of sexy. The other aspect is that I'm really horny, but Nancy doesn't seem to be. She doesn't seem to have the energy to masturbate, except when she wants a guy to blow her. I wouldn't mind that too much.</p> <p>The party ended very nicely. Even though there were plenty of people, most of those who were there was just enjoying sex and talking about the party. Then we were all invited to a special family party with Nancy's cousin, my aunt, my brother's brother, his friends, and my friends from high school, the old folks. It's hard to remember all of the names, but I'm sure it must be difficult for everyone.</p> <p>It was the end of the day, and after I had cleaned up everyone's messes and cleaned up Nancy's messy bedroom area, we all went home. Even though Nancy had already fucked my brother, and since Uncle Jim and Cousin Jim had already gone home together, we all got dressed by the kitchen door and went into the living room. Everybody else would go home. It wouldn't be a long party. Maybe a day or two could be spent in peace.</p> <p>After taking a quick shower, Nancy joined me in the living room and we sat together on the sofa. She reached over to rub my knee, and said, "Honey, you know you've made me so excited. Just think of all the other possibilities we've had that will follow the end of the party, and it ends up being a sex party, or maybe a day with somebody else. I really, really want you to be able to have sex with anyone and anytime the minute you ask."</p> <p>"Then she reached over to me and hugged me. "H took my hand and I kissed back to kiss her. I held and she said, "I love you, "Oh Nancy'sâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
