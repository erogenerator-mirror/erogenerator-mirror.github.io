Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XIX The Hermitage of Noot</h4><p><strong>“Tell me of what has passed in Egypt since Ochus conquered and Nectanebes fled away. Does Ochus still live, Daughter?” asked Noot after a pause during which both of us</strong> thought.</p> <p>I knew from our earlier conversation that Noreen was not at all concerned but answered the second question honestly, “He left only last year, ofcourse. However, I cannot go back to the ways of the Pharaoh”, I added when my voice became unsteady, almost too quiet.</p> <p>“My mother was also on that road and I must be her daughter. I would not mind her marrying you if that”. Again like I had earlier said, she had chosen. When we kissed, Noreen put her hand on my breast and as our lips and tongues continued our kissing my desire to press her harder was rising so as she was by now not able to stop. I had already decided upon my next move so as Noreen’s arm moved to my breast and she rolled my nipple between her fingers I knew she could tell my body as my legs got closer and closer to my own climax. At the same time Noreen was still on top of me kissing me. My knees almost gave way and I fell onto the bed; I was still feeling her. I had already said that I was a sexual lover. And she had not said anything else but I had to tell her that.</p> <p>We were now on either side of her. Noreen had still been on her knees and I still on my chest. Noreen’s body was still on me. My hand caressing her back and waist and waist. I turned down my waist so that my hand could slide down her body and onto my own hip but I held it back. Noreen’s hands went to mine; we were still on our knees. Noreen kissed me again but we could not kiss yet, we needed to.</p> <p>“Kiss me.” Noreen directed me so I lowered my head to where her head was on my breasts. Noreen still kissing me, her lips and her tongue exploring my chest and nipples as I was kissing her nipples and hers doing the same with them.</p> <p>Noreen moved the other way so that she could kiss my other breast. Noreen’s hand slid down my body. And I opened my thighs to give her access. Noreen kissed and licked the flesh above and below my navel. She had already brought us a few orgasms and now it was not enough to quench her thirst.</p> <p>In the darkness I found Noreen’s mouth kissing the lips of my pussy which she had opened. She licked my lips with the end of her tongue. She had obviously tasted me before. And my pussy opened and accepted her tongue. She pushed into my vagina with her tongue, finding my clitoris and licking it between her lips, sucking it. My knees were still over her and I kept them closed as Noreen’s face rose to my mouth. Kissing it and feeling it. Kissing my lips. And her lips had touched the parts that were not available to me. Noreen’s teeth had been on the sides and the other parts I was feeling there.</p> <p>She moved her lips to my clitoris which was just above her teeth and her teeth had touched the others lips. She nibbled the skin inside my vagina and my nipples which were still lying before Noreen’s thighs which were still over mine. She put her whole hand between us and explored it. She touched the sides and back of my vagina, rubbing my clitoris with one hand, the other down her side. Her fingers pushed into my vagina and the other side which was still on top.</p> <p>Her hand went down where she was kissing the lips and making me feel. She opened her legs so she was lying at the bottom on the bed with Noreen lying with her legs over mine.</p> <p>I was already in the 69 position and Noreen started kissing my belly making me feel so wanton in my passion, my desire to be near her and also wanting us to be together. As Noreen’s hand was rubbing my clit she felt my legs going wider. She spread them on either side of mine and took her fingers inside so she could spread them around and explore each side of my vulva. The others lips had now touched her clit as well.</p> <p>Noreen kissed the inside of my thigh right next to my clitoris. It was the first time she had been on top of me kissing my thighs and I was already close to climaxing and her mouth was still making me feel all of the pleasure of ecstasy from both sides as I had the sensations of my clitoris and my vagina.</p> <p>Now Noreen’s fingers were in my vulva, my vagina and my breasts. I was coming close to climax. I was in the ultimate climax which she said, it will do for us both of us both of us—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
