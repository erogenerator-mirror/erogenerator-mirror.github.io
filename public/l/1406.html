My guardian</strong> and clerk, Jim, were both younger then I but they still had the same appearance, the same personality, and the same height. They were both very attractive, very intelligent, and also very sexy. Jim was more athletic looking than I was, but he was also fairly easy on the eyes.</p> <p>I had no idea what Jim stood for. I couldn't tell who my guardian could have been, but Jim was easily six-four or as tall as I am, but I doubted whether he had a penis. I guessed he was about six-two. I decided that I liked him as well, and I told Jimmy that I liked him too.</p> <p>But my guardians left me some cash at the restaurant. I told Jimmy about it and he wanted to know if he remembered to take all my credit cards from the bottom. Just like Jim, I gave him money to have if he still cared to pay my bill. Jimmy agreed to come to the restaurant and give me a blowjob.</p> <p>I had a lot of things on my mind, like what my guardian and clerk looked like. Jimmy also got to fuck. I couldn't tell if they were going to fuck or not. He had a very large cock, about eight inches when erect but had shrunk as my youth and then tapered back down to a modest seven inches when it was hard.</p> <p>And then he gave me his dick and used his hand as well. I found it incredibly sexy to be used like that. I was getting turned on thinking about him when I didn't even know they were there. Just thinking about it made it even more erotic. Then I had my first real orgasm and it wasn't the climax of a long drawn out orgasm, it was just a release from the intense sexual tension that has always been there. I loved it just thinking about them.</p> <p>Once I had finally reached the point of no return, I decided I really, really wanted to have a cum, to just let it out and let the feelings take me completely over the edge, let them consume me, take me wherever I wanted, have the control I had been deprived of but could never have. And then I started thinking about just that.</p> <p>"Jim, I really, really want you. I really, really want your prick in my mouth. It feels so good. It is so nice to suck a beautiful penis. It is like sliding cock-meat in and out of a porno magazine but without the cock!"</p> <p>"OK," he said. "Sure. What have you got in mind?"</p> <p>He turned to the clerk and handed him his money.</p> <p>"Let me at that", the clerk said.</p> <p>"That's better," I said. "If you don't mind it is!"</p> <p>The clerk handed Jimmy his card and Jim paid him, too.</p> <p>Jim said, "The lady at the register said your name is Ashley."</p> <p>"Ashley, huh? Is that why you got my cock so early? So I could give it to you?"</p> <p>"It was your idea," Jimmy said.</p> <p>"It was your idea," I said with a big smile.</p> <p>"It wasn't my idea," Jimmy said, sounding like he was actually blushing, but the look on his face was one of excitement. He was actually blushing.</p> <p>I thought, "It looks like that's what he means by it."</p> <p>When Jim left the restaurant, Jim said, "Ashley, do you know how old you are?"</p> <p>"Hi, Jimmy," I said, looking into his eyes to see if he noticed anything. "The lady at the counter asked how old I was, which didn't bother her, does it?"</p> <p>"Ashley, it's just a couple of minutes before you need your first blowjob," he said, sounding a little nervous.</p> <p>I said, "It's just a couple of minutes before I'm ready for a real blowjob," and I started rubbing my breasts up and down and feeling his eyes on me. I felt really sexy. I looked up at him, smiling. He didn't say anything. He just looked nervous. I asked him, "Would you prefer me to suck your cock as the driver, so I can blow you?"</p> <p>"No," he said quickly, "this is a good blowjob. I really need to blow you."</p> <p>I knew I didn't have what it took. I was a good blowjob. With one hand, I held his cock, the other I massaged his balls, stroking his cock and balls, feeling him pulse and move. I got off the other side of the counter and sat on the counter. Heber. I had a chair to push into the position so the seat. It was right position so my ass was straight out side.</p> <p>so the door is facing me. Jimmy could reach right, and the right the front—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
