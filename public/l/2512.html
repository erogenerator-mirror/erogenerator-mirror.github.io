The mirror reflection's image of the man stood before the mirror, his cock standing erect, waiting for his partner as to show the reflection's desire to fuck.</p> <p>"How's that?" he whispered. "Yeah, it's perfect."</p> <p>"Oh, you like that?" she said. "You want your cock in my ass? Or is this something else? Have you been waiting all day for this? Have you just wanted some big cock in your pussy?"</p> <p>"It's perfect," he said. "I'm so wet."</p> <p>"You like me in front of you?" she asked; now she reached around and fondled his cock. "You're hard again."</p> <p>'I'm so hard that I'm going to come any second. I am so eager,' he thought.</p> <p>"Yes you are."</p> <p>"Do you like it?" she asked. "Do you like my ass? Did I do this for my fantasy man? Does this ass turn you on?"</p> <p>"It turns me on very much," he confessed. "I love how you are handling my cock. I get so excited when I jack off with you."</p> <p>"Mmmm," she said. "I guess now's the time for a real cock in my ass." She pulled his cock to the side and rubbed it on her ass cleavage. "I'm so hard. Do you want to watch?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Just stand by the mirror, OK?"</p> <p>"Alright," he confirmed. She pushed her butt back toward him and lifted her hips up slightly. The mirror came forward. She looked to her side and to the right. She began to fondle his cock while she stood on the mirror. "This looks so fun, but I'm still scared."</p> <p>"You can be careful with it," he assured her as she stood up. "If you're not careful with my cock, I'll come too soon, and it's not really safe."</p> <p>With trembling hands, she turned around and put the head of his cock in the hole of her asshole. She pushed it against the anal canal.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels good," he said.</p> <p>"That's because my ass is just so hot and tight," she said as she leaned her face toward his, their lips meeting. When she kissed him, she whispered, "I love your cock in my butt. I love looking in your eyes and knowing that I have a complete stranger in my life."</p> <p>She was right, he thought, and she was looking right back. She kissed him and moved forward as he slowly pushed his cock in and out of her anus.</p> <p>"Oh, shit!" he said in wonder. "You're fucking my ass, so tight. It feels so good."</p> <p>"Yeah," she agreed. "I just love it when you've got a nice long cock in my butt." Slowly and deeply, he fucked her ass as the mirror reflected her naked back. He loved the sensation from the mirror reflection's perspective of the face of the man in the mirror-boy's cock sliding in her. The reflection could show the reflection's cock and the reflection's dick at the same time. He could watch the reflection's face as it drove into the mirror and watch his cock slide in and out of her asshole. Her eyes in their reflection could lock onto one another- the reflection could see everything. It was obvious that the whole face was a woman. He could even imagine the reflection's eye's staring into his, or into the reflection's face. It was obviously a man, but also clearly a woman. The reflection could see her face and know that she was the woman he was fucking. It wasn't so much that her whole body could be seen except the lips, lips, ass, and hips. He could see her breasts, her ass, her pussy and her legs. It wasn't like a woman who, despite all the physical intimacy, was completely anonymous in sex. Was she a woman who really cared enough about being fucked in the ass to turn out to be a total slut?</p> <p>He was fascinated by the reflection's reflection's face and face as it drove into her. She could see the reflection's mouth. There was a smile, and she looked right back at the reflection. She could see her own lips; it was a sign she was happy with what she was doing. There was no doubt that her lips and mouth were as full of sex and desire as the mirror's reflection's face. It made it look like she was in love and had just fucked. His ass that mirror, for the reflection could see her face and be fucked. It was so beautiful.</p> <p></p> <p>As she stood there was the reflection, she was looking right into the reflection's eyes of her eyesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
