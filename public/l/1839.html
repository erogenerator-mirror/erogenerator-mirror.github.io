In the mind that is once truly disciplined and purged, thou canst</h4><p><strong>not find anything, either foul or impure, or as it were festered: nothing that is either servile, or affected: no partial tie; no malicious averseness; nothing obnoxious; nothing concealed. The</strong> final outcome was still the question, and it was time for it to be answered in its most complete, most explicit form.</p> <p>He lay on his back.</p> <p>He could not think.</p> <p>She, on her knees between his legs, was straddling him, lowering herself down. He could not move.</p> <p>'This is what you needed, isn't it?' She murmured.</p> <p>He could not reply.</p> <p>She lowered herself to him.</p> <p>She lowered herself to her right knee, the other knee now in the air at his head.</p> <p>He could not move. Not speak.</p> <p>'Please,' she whispered, 'touch me, touch me, touch me. Please. Please, so gently, so lovingly.' She lowered herself down, her knees pressing into his thighs. She reached her hands back, pulling away for a moment, then grasped him by the hair, his back, and pushed down, hard, on the head of his penis.</p> <p>Then she raised her pelvis.</p> <p>He could feel the heat of her through his foreskin. Slowly he stroked himself against her, and she lowered herself.</p> <p>Slowly.</p> <p>Then, suddenly, oh so slowly, slowly: one, two thrusting, four thrusting in succession into a tight, hot, clasping, moist tunnel, stretched, wet. He had been given no real choice. His penis slid easily in and out of her. She pressed down. Up. Up. Up. And up. He stroked in and out. Her hands gripped his shoulder tightly. She thrust hard all the while, meeting him to match the thrusts. She held his face in her hands and kissed him roughly as though her body might shatter if she didn't get over him. He had no idea how long he remained inside her, as rigid as he was, but when she lifted her pelvis again, and again pushed down, his penis slid inside again. She repeated this stroke after thrust after thrust into her. He thrust all of himself into her. He thrust into her pussy once, twice, three times. She gasped: she groaned. She pulled him down. She pushed. Her hands pulled him all the way down. She moaned and gasped and grunted and groaned and gasped. He moved with her. Up. Down. Up. Down.</p> <p>'I'm going to cum,' he said.</p> <p>'Just lie back,' she said.</p> <p>And he lay back, and she rose, straddled his still-erect penis, facing his feet.</p> <p>'I want it inside me," she said again.</p> <p>And he could not move.</p> <p>She lifted herself up and down on his penis. He could feel the wetness of her pussy and the softness of her breasts on his thigh. He touched and felt himself with one hand, and with the other he held the side of her face and her hair.</p> <p>"You want it, too," he said.</p> <p>She raised herself a degree or two.</p> <p>'No,' she said.</p> <p>But she pulled his face to hers, and they kissed, long, and sensual, and they sucked and she kissed him.</p> <p>He pulled her head towards him, and she felt the tip of his penis touch against her pubic hair, her vagina.</p> <p>'Please,' she said.</p> <p>She pulled his buttocks towards her.</p> <p>He reached up and grabbed her breasts in his hands: he could feel she had no bra on, and her nipples, so swollen to hard, were like two tiny, rubber buds, pressing themselves against his palms. She pulled her head back and pushed her breasts forward and she sucked in his nipple.</p> <p>He moved his fingers over and around her nipples. He squeezed so that they became erect little points.</p> <p>The hand had moved down between her legs.</p> <p>He wanted to say 'there!' but his penis was still as stiff as the pole, and he did not dare; in fact he did not want to say anything.</p> <p>She turned onto her back. This had become her favourite position, to make love up to the moon. He lay on his back, while she lowered her head to his penis head and licked the shaft, the glans, the head. But he could not stay awake this time.</p> <p>Slowly she took his penis into her mouth and sucked it. His testicles had fallen to the floor. She licked and sucked; he felt her tongue on the bottom of his penis, between his testes. He felt himself grow further into her mouth, until at last she rose, turned and fell again, holding his penis in her mouth and kissing and licking as if she had the tip of his entire pubic to her mouth, so well. She felt its warmth, so well, so gently its length and so well: so: he could touch of herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
