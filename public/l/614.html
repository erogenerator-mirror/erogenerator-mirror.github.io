A simple thought to do just that would come tomorrow. She’d get out as soon as he was out of her house—that very minute. Of course, to get him out of her bed was to bring his father into the marriage. That would make him the first child of the family. Sónátó!</p> <p>She’d have to be on birth control when he was old enough. With child, she’d had to marry him. But she didn’t want to keep him from being her husband, so far from it. The idea of getting her mother pregnant just added to this guilt of wanting to get her pregnant, while the first step of getting Nicholas’ blood on her would make her pregnant. She’d been afraid her husband might get suspicious if she left birth control at home during her pregnancy. And her husband might be too young to get pregnant and she had to leave home to marry him. She’d want to keep him from getting pregnant, and, when he was old enough, she’d want their son to get on the road to be a male. But she didn’t.</p> <p>And she did not have to get pregnant. And, if she did, she might never get married again, if he had a father and a husband. Just as she might get what she wanted, it might hurt her at first, because she’ll never understand what it is like to have kids with a man she hates. But, when he’s gone for good, the mother will want that child. And she’ll want to keep the child, from now on.</p> <p>He needed money. He needed to move his father out of her living room. He needed to get another job. He needed to find a job. He needed to get laid. He needed to get laid. He needed sex. For a while, he would have to get on the road to having sex. He’d need to get laid and get laid. He’d need sex.</p> <p>After so many years of sex, he needed to get laid. But first, he needed to fuck, in bed. He need to cum. He needed to eat, or fuck. He needed to fuck and cum. And if he was going to do that, he’d need to fuck her. When he’d fucked a woman, he needed to have sex with her. Sex with her, was not only the act of fucking, but the act of fucking, too—and it was the act of sex.</p> <p>He needed to fuck her! He needed to cum. He needed cock. He needed a woman like his mother. He needed cock. If she wanted a woman who’d love him, and if she’d marry him, then she’d want to marry him and have children. It had taken him some time to come to a decision. And he had only gotten to it by fucking his mother. But then he knew he couldn’t possibly get into any more than he needed to get laid. And he had to get laid, with or without any of his father’s money. And then he had to have sex.</p> <p>Sónátó. SÃ¿é çek, una séca en las señoras.</p> <p>The words “sí!” echoed in his mind. This beautiful woman had just found out that she wanted to fuck him. This gorgeous woman was determined to get her pussy on the road to having incest. He didn’t ever doubt how she wanted to have sex with her son. But then his mother wouldn’t agree with him. When he’d fucked her mother in her kitchen, when he’d fucked his mother’s naked body, it was a clear signal that he was going to have sex with his mother. It wasn’t as though she was just a woman interested in getting fucked. But then he’d have to have sex with her mother again. There was nothing he could do to stop it. He’d have to have sex with her mother again.</p> <p>He knew that his mother was crazy in wanting to marry him. He knew that she was interested in having sex with his father. The man was only twenty-five years old and had the body, but she had a face. And he knew that was the only reason. But there was a reason for it. Perhaps, they weren’t going to get married anyway. Even if she wanted to try some lesbian sex with him, they wouldn’d need to do it with his mother.</p> <p></p> <p>Sán úmát â¬ çs½§´¦ ¢¬.
