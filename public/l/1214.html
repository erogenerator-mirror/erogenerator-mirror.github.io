It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal battle against pestilence and suffocation. It was, at the same time, a voyage of discovery. One of the survivors</strong>, a young man named Carl, stood at the opening of a cave in the forest near Argentina. He had lost all sight of his environment, and would, in fact, be dead by the time he reached the cave. It was time to get back to civilization.</p> <p>When they were inside the cave, she looked into his eyes and kissed him, his mouth, his neck, then the rest of his body with her lips and hands. She could feel him in her breasts and in her bottom, and she liked his big dick. She felt it rubbing against her pussy lips, which parted. She wanted him inside. She had to fuck this big, hard dick. It took her by surprise. Then she thought of something. There might not be a time limit. She grabbed his dick and started to stroke it. It grew. Then she put it in her mouth and proceeded to suck it. Then she did it again--and again, and again. It felt so good.</p> <p>When she felt he was in her, she took a little of his juice in her fingers and rubbed them over her boobs, then to her mouth, and again to his dick. She knew his body better than anyone. She took more and more of his dick into her mouth--the shaft was still wet--and then put almost all of it inside her hot mouth. She didn't know where to begin.</p> <p>"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!" He cried.</p> <p>Then her lips began to massage his dick--she could not get his whole dick in her mouth--it would cause a mistake! He was so big! She wondered what it would feel like to him. If she could fit it, how would she do it?</p> <p>Then she thought of something else. He didn't seem to know what she meant, but he reached under her and felt her pussy in the middle of his body. Then their bodies got tangled. The top of his butt came into contact with her thighs, but with each of them, they could only move their bodies an inch-and-quarter. Then they were kissing! When their lips were separated, their kisses became feverous! Each tongue explored the other's mouth with passion! Then their mouths became more active--making the other more and more passionate. This went on for some time until the first hot jets of her pussy juice began to splash on her belly and lower, and, of course, on his dick. Then she felt her pussy pulsation and knew something was happening--just one more big dick--would go in it. It would be just as she knew it would be; just as he had imagined in his fantasies. All he had needed to do is ask for it. All she had to do was take it! Now! She held him closer to her body, like a baby in the cradle. It was such a big dick! He felt its hardness against her body. He held himself so that it was between her legs. He didn't know it would be so much of a difference. It was as good and long, and thick as his own. But it was not as big as his dick. As soon as they felt each others bodies get aroused, they would do it.</p> <p>They stayed like that forever, naked, hugging, just holding each other--but it was not intercourse. This was a whole new kind of sex. They were naked! Naked and intimate. They were just like children in the bathtub.</p> <p>And, finally, it was his turn. He said: "Oh, it is your turn for me now—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
