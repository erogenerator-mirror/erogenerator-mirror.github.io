M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER X. Anne’s Apology</h4><p><strong>MARILLA said nothing to Matthew about the affair that evening; but when Anne proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be made to account for her absence</strong> and the event's absence.</p> <p>The last time I saw her was when she was in her early twenties. She was still a baby.</p> <p>I had her.</p> <p>After a day of wondering what a real kiss would be like.</p> <p>After a day that involved sex.</p> <p>I'm only seventeen.</p> <p>After years of confusion and confusion, I was lucky to have her.</p> <p>Her name was Anne. Her name was Anne with whom I knew she was special.</p> <p>At the first sight of her, I remember that night as a teenager, still in a fog of her eyes and the smell of her hair mixed with the perfume of her perfume. And for the first time, I remember everything that happened while dreaming in her dreams: the feel of her hand on my cheek and how she leaned into me when she was asleep.</p> <p>I remember it now.</p> <p>My dream was a mistake that lasted a lifetime.</p> <p>The night we fell asleep in my bed together. The day I was dreaming that Anne was the first woman I'd ever fucked. My dream was a mistake that was a mistake to me that was a mistake I never wanted to be. How did a man make a mistake of his own? How did I make a mistake because my own body and my mind made the mistake?</p> <p>My friend, my best friend, my best friend - my only friends.</p> <p>The woman I loved, the love I had for my fiancée, my wife.</p> <p>My friends in school, my friends in town, my families, my colleagues, my fellow friends... I was a one hundred percent devoted guy. Of course, I'm not that lucky for any one that she knew all those things, but it wasn't my fault that I was her secret lover; there was certainly no need to hide anything between us. That was one thing that we shared. That was an entire lifetime of happiness between a man and a woman. It's a life that we both hoped and prayed it could bring us.</p> <p>"Hang on, dear reader," said Anne, "if she doesn't mind, would you mind helping me out of this bra and panties?"</p> <p>Oh, god, how could I do that? Of course I'd be honored to help her out of hers.</p> <p>She looked incredibly sexy in a sexy nightie, with a little lace at the top of her breasts and a matching bow down the middle of her smooth tummy. Her face was radiant with a deep golden brown glow. Her green eyes shone with love and happiness. She looked so utterly beautiful.</p> <p>"H-e-e-e, dear reader." She gave me a wink. And I know, at least enough to tell you to be careful about how you say her name: "Anne."</p> <p>She reached for her dress, but I moved away. Instead, I moved to the mirror on the wall and stared at her with a dainty grin. A little more daring than if I'd been staring all night at her in my dream, I'd kissed Anne. And now I wondered if I'd ever be able to do those things again.</p> <p>I looked at my nightie when I was a teenager and remembered, to make myself even smaller, that it had somehow become her night dress.</p> <p>"You know, I still think we were both wearing a lot of underwear."</p> <p>My cock twitched and grew hard in my jeans. How could I say no to her? I'd been looking at her the same while watching movies on TV or on my tv and not once since our last encounter when I'd wanted to kiss her...</p> <p>And I was still hard.</p> <p>I'd thought all that. I'd imagined everything that we'd been doing with each other. My fantasy was coming true. I'd been dreaming of what I wanted to do to this woman in the darkness of her eyelids and her face. And now I'd experienced it. I'd been dreaming of what I could do to her.</p> <p>I'd been dreaming of sucking her nipples. I'd been dreaming of her taking my cock in her mouth, fucking me with her lips... no pun intended to be the other people, only my friend or someone else, but just for pleasure.</p> <p>... for us... for my cock.. the others... for us... me. and me... for me.. that... for the universe...</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I mean... us together... one Together with us together Together And for me Together Together with together Together with us, together and both in one and and the other together for us</p> <p></p> <p>Together and our lives Together together</p> <p></p> <p>Together and together Forever together Together forever together we can only Together forever And together together and together and Together and together and together We Together—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
