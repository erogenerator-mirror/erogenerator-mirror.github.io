Matrimonial Projects</h4><p><strong>The day following this scene, at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his coupé did not appear. At</strong> least that was until he saw her when she was going to his office just one block down from his.</p> <p>He couldn't believe his eyes.</p> <p>What was she wearing? A very tight skirt with thigh high heels, which was one more outfit he'd bought her that night. He could even see what looked like a thong. There were also, though, other outfits.</p> <p>What she wore that night was a thong—or—nothing.</p> <p>She wore a pair of thigh high heel boots that came up four inches above her bare feet. While the heels were leather and not particularly high, in her case they felt like a pair of shoes that would make his cock start throbbing. What she wore had a low-cut top.</p> <p>Those things were obviously designed to make girls in his office sit up straight.</p> <p>The boots did not hide the fact that her long, tanned legs and her tight waist were encased in leather. That was why it was so tight—that leather looked so tight to him.</p> <p>The boots were also tight between her knee-highs when they were higher. That meant that her ass was clearly outlined against the tight leather.</p> <p>His cock started throbbing against his pants as he watched a young girl enter his office wearing nothing but a thong.</p> <p>He loved looking at her legs when she was wearing thigh high boots like that. She had such smooth skin, like skin with no lines.</p> <p>Dazzlars had a tendency to look so much like a thong that you couldn't tell if the girl wasn't wearing it, it was so tight. If she did wear it the way that the way it looked on her was the way it looked on a girl wearing a thong. In that case, if she did wear it the way she was wearing it all night, and it was sexy, too, the thong could easily hide her ass from view. But she had it all the way up one side, and his cock was so uncomfortable. The bottom of his pants pressed against his cock and, in her tight white skirt and high heels, the material of her thong was so tight, he feared that she might show her ass and he wished her ass that much that night. He wished her ass that much.</p> <p>So when the girl came into his office, wearing nothing else but thigh highs and high heels, he got a glimpse of her bare ass. The white leather boots looked so hot, he imagined sliding his cock between the leather of them. He imagined his cock between her thighs.</p> <p>They didn't have to see it.</p> <p>He was sure that he could. There were no cameras, they could be outside monitoring him. But he couldn't find one.</p> <p>She saw him staring at her. She saw his eyes and her cheeks. She made a face. She smiled. And she waved.</p> <p>The girl did just that. She motioned him toward her while she sat down beside him.</p> <p>As she introduced herself and spoke, so she showed her right side of the face of the camera to him. Like a man at a wedding, she had a white face with large, dark lips that could be shaped into his own. He couldn't help but stare at them. And then she asked him the question that she wanted to ask.</p> <p>"Do you still own it?"</p> <p>"It's beautiful."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"Do you still fuck?"</p> <p>"God no." She smiled and winked. "It's so sexy, darling."</p> <p>"If you know what's good for you, you have to take it in stride, darling."</p> <p>"Oh, I know how to take it." She smiled and winked again, almost as a challenge. "You have to ask."</p> <p>He didn't take the offer. He just looked at her while she talked.</p> <p>At that moment, he realized it would probably have been much easier than having to ask her question. All he wanted to do now was watch her and, while getting the job done, he thought about her legs.</p> <p>Why did she keep doing that? It was so sexy, to have her walk the office so as to seduce every one of the office staff by wearing thigh high boots like this. The woman's stocking tops weren't a little thin, but no more than she could possibly take them off herself. He thought how sexy she looked without the support of the lace top of those boots, and the skirt she wore her skirt riding boots and blouse and blouse in the office. In the way that her legs looked. But it felt so good.</p> <p>in her. He just walking up to get it. He imagined how it. Like she had to wear it and wear and enjoy. her.</p> <p>he knew. so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
