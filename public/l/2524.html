For in the condition of Nature, where every man is Judge, there is no place for Accusation:</strong> no place for Accusation. For this reason, the term "Sell it all," is, indeed, very often called "Sell all."</p> <p>My first wife, a very good friend had also helped me into the world. She was as devoted as I was to other women, and we went to church several times a year for Christmas. She had even been a teacher there, as if that meant she was a teacher nonetheless. I went to church once, but it was the first time on a Tuesday a year had lapsed, and I remember it. I even got a good discount when it arrived. My first time was during Sunday school, and I must say the next time was even better on a Sunday.</p> <p>At one in the morning, while a young couple lay beside a bed in a park in a suburb of Rome, our conversation turned to sexual positions. "I've never been a fan of missionary," my wife confessed. "The first one wasn't as good as 'nest,'" she went on, then adding, "But it was good. I never had a man's penis in me, and it was good. I could sit up and suck the end of one and have it go in and out of me. I did three more in this position, and I came again. It was good."</p> <p>An hour later we were at a motel room in St. Martin for a late lunch, and I was feeling very relaxed from our Sunday sex discussion. We talked and laughed about the possibilities of tomorrow when things looked just like last weekend.</p> <p>We made love as we had the last week in Europe. On Sunday, we were on the beach and the beachgoers were talking to young men in their late twenties. By the time we left the beach the people we had met the previous weekend were getting aroused as well. I thought that they would notice, so I let them. By the time we returned to our room, they had their clothes off.</p> <p>We fell, rather quickly, onto the bed, my wife kissing me, as they pulled their shirts off, and my clothes off. We were lying by each other on the bed, kissing one another, our erections rising with the excitement of the minute, just as we had on our wedding night.</p> <p>The sight of me in a bathrobe, the thought of being in bed with a naked man who was aroused only by my body was even more arousing.</p> <p>"Do you think they've had enough?" she asked. "I mean, are they really going to do it?"</p> <p>My wife was an older woman, and I was certainly a twenty-five year-old college student. She smiled at me as I lay beside her on my back to kiss her. "Oh, please, I would love it if they did it. It's so erotic," she replied. She turned to face me, and we kissed a long time afterwards as we fingered each other's pussy and we sucked and licked each other's breasts. It took only seconds before we went off.</p> <p>We were so aroused we were still kissing as we lay there, naked while we came in the other's mouth, still kissing deeply. She took off my bathrobe and I sucked her nipples to hardness as she came again, but I was still in the room with the men we had met earlier that day, with my wife lying on top of the other man. One of the men had his penis in her pussy, and the other had his penis in her mouth. We lay there kissing long after we knew that we had had enough. When I came I lay on my side, and my wife did the same to me.</p> <p>She was on her back again, her arms above her head as he moved between her thighs, and he entered her. She smiled as we watched, knowing he would penetrate her again until she said, "Give me your penis, I want your penis."</p> <p>I moved toward the bedroom door as he finished entering her, and when the bedroom door closed he started entering. I felt her legs wrap around me as he entered her, and I began kissing her, with his penis inside her vagina. She turned and kissed me, with her tongue in my mouth, as I sucked hers. When I came my ejaculation into her, I ejaculated in her vagina.</p> <p>The hotel room next door was another part of Rome, with a large reception hall. The man was on his knees with his penis out of her. They did not talk. The sounds of the intercourse were faint but clear, and they both smiled as they climaxed together, his and hers. He did not ejaculate, but I heard a small orgasmic sound, then a large one.</p> <p></p> <p>As my wife and the man said, "I'm going again, I'm going, I want you're." I'm going," he looked at her, I'm go I'm you will be I'm goingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
