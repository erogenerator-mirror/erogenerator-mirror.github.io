Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor</h4><p><strong>without due examination, nor with reluctancy. Affect not to set out thy thoughts with curious neat language. Be neither a great talker, nor a great undertaker. Moreover, let thy God</strong> say there is not a greater feeling in this day, than a good, passionate fucking.</p> <p>While we fuck like men, and we fuck like people, we are not able to see who is, and not to know who the hell we are fucking. The great thing, was when, for the first time in my life, I am a man who truly knows what he is doing, fucking. The pleasure is derived, not from fucking by the hand of a God, and from fucking by a human being, like a person born upon this earth through age. We fuck like the beasts that we are, in a world wherein love is only known in God's hand, and in Heaven it only is known through the eyes of the man whom God is in possession on earth, and therefore, in us. If god is the supreme deity, then he is the god of love, and love is the reward for us.</p> <p>As my hands found their way beneath my dress, which I had kept in such an manner that it had to fall to the floor, I had to give the impression that, with all our combined will, I was now capable of bending my body to the very limits of perfection. It gave me a shiver of arousal and excitement, which I had not felt before. If I could bend myself to the most carnal desires, if I could turn myself to God to satisfy them, I would do anything to fulfill the holy pleasure God has given me. I did not want to go into the details, save perhaps to suggest that if the pleasure were extended beyond that which pleasure could exist, but I did.</p> <p>After several long strokes, I raised my dress and put my fingers inside myself between my thighs. With the lubrication and the anticipation of being fucked, I opened myself to the delight of my fingers to discover that, even through my own efforts, with so much pleasure, I could not take my knickers down as far as I wanted me to.</p> <p>My dress had fallen well above my knees to the floor, exposing my long slim legs all the way to where the top of my suspenders came together with the bottom of my knickers. Then there was my breasts. The dress fell on my chest and down to my belly, which at the moment seemed so full. It was the best I had seen and the first time I had seen a man's penis. The only thing I had seen was a girl's. But what could a man see, if a woman's breasts. If another woman's breasts were beautiful - could that make love or fuck or fuck!</p> <p>My eyes were transfixed on my lover. He was fully clothed. Even his face had been covered in my lipstick. But there was no denying. As hard as I wished I was going to fuck him again. This time to the top of his body.</p> <p>As one, we were kissing, and I had the chance to do my teeth and fingers and lips, while we kissed madly and passionately. The sensation of a man's tongue against mine, made my first orgasm. Not the first orgasm of my life. I did not know how much more of this would be. I was thinking that perhaps God had chosen to have me. Perhaps God had arranged for me to wear my panties to bed. Or perhaps he had chosen to make me wear panties - I would wear panties under my dress and to bed. Surely He would have allowed it to happen. Maybe He would have allowed me to have sex, and he has chosen to have sex. And the panties do not require the underwear being made.</p> <p>I had my dress off to reveal my breasts. So I was going to have to go through and have my breasts covered in his saliva. I reached between my legs to feel his bulge. It appeared to be more and more hard.</p> <p>I took advantage of this to put my fingers inside the back of my panties so that both my body and mine were exposed. His cock was just visible in the light. It was bigger than it had been in any way.</p> <p>There were no words, just a series of grunts, gasps and moans, as if I was making out with a man. But there were many noises. There were both grunts and moans, and some of the sounds of fucking, that it took to get a man to climax. I knew that he would. He had done it often enough, he said, to be able to cum a lot if I did not leave behind.</p> <p>It was the first time when my body had taken the first steps to having a man at my back. I could feel the tension in the hairs on the back of my neck. I looked at him, and smiled. He knew how to pleasure a woman. In that woman. I did not need to take that step again. I was just getting a moment that there myself. I did to reach my orgasm. I needed to feel.</p> <p></p> <p>I did not leaveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
