When he did come down, it was to attend</strong> the rehearsal dinner he had planned with his wife and daughter, in preparation, of making that evening a memorable one. For a first date they had gone far enough tonight, as long as their plans were not rushed. In their time together, however, Mrs. Riess had become increasingly adept at finding things that excited her, particularly the most intimate parts. She found a particular weakness—a weakness not far off from hers—in not only her body but especially in the genital area. When there was no danger of birth soon after birth, it just made for a very satisfying one in a certain way that would only last a short time. When they made love when it was the right time, however, there had to be no danger of conception until it was done. That was their goal of late. And now, the moment of conception had come.</p> <p>They began the evening out as if nothing else had mattered at all. Mrs. Rochester had gone on first, to a table, then sat and sipped on a glass of wine. Mr. Rochester took Mrs. Riess to a private bathroom off the kitchen in the back. When he came back, he ordered her to strip to her bra, panties, and skirt. His favorite: a dress as short as the one he had chosen for dinner.</p> <p>She was in a state now. After a couple of minutes of his order not taking her, but rather giving her time enough for her to get the show going, Mr. Rochester told Mrs. Riess to lie on the bed. She quickly complied. He told her to hold on to the headboard until he returned. She obeyed. Then he told her to place her hands together in the middle of the headboard, and to hold her hands up at the same time. When he returned, he asked her to lay on her back. She immediately complied. This time he was on top of her. He pulled her legs wide apart and held her ankles up above her head as he began to do it for her. He had never fucked her before, but he liked every minute of it, and it felt good to him too.</p> <p>When to the point he was finished, Mr. Rochester pulled out and turned her onto her back again. He pulled the thong string in a long straight line from her crotch to her stomach. Then the other. She had a large white rose bush, that stood proud above the pink and curly hair covering her crotch, as if it wanted his finger to touch it. He told her to lift her hips toward her head and he began fucking her in earnest. When it was clear that she was not ready for her first time, she didn’t ask. She let him do it. He came just then. Once he was fully spent, he turned off the lights, went to his bag, and came back with a glass of wine. He handed her one, as well. They drank them both together. They were laughing as they did. The wine made her feel mellow, a mellow way, and this made her feel very warm and very happy. He was a well-made man, a real man, and now he brought joy into Mrs. Rochester’s life.</p> <p>They made love, and she made love with a different purpose. It was something new and different. It pleased and thrilled her that there was always something new and exciting about sex, that it always came from the right direction. And it always was. That was what she and Mr. Rochester had always called it. Now something new and different was now—a new kind of passion and desire. And a different kind of passion and excitement. It took a few more minutes before Mrs. Rochester saw again how a man could enjoy this sexiness of a woman. She watched him as he fucked her.</p> <p>She was ready now, so he knew it. He pushed into her, and then, and then, until their bodies were both moving. He fucked her, while she was doing something to him too. She kept working him with her cunt, like that, while he was fucking her in a sixty-nine. Mrs. Rochester was moving with him, and he was fucking her too—with a new urgency. She was making the woman in her wantonness want more and more with each thrust she made, for they were both going full bore there. She came and came, until he came to another orgasm. Just after the first one, his arms became very tired. He pulled out of her and turned her over to him, and then he fucked her. She wanted his last orgasm to be with him. But he couldn’t hold himself up. He collapsed on Mrs. Rochester once more, and she collapsed beside him on her back as their mutual lovemaking and lust had finished. They were both breathing hard from the moment of her arrival. Mrs. After a few seconds she asked him to say, she spoke, she said, “Now, what will you”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
