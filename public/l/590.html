This is how it happened. When he woke</strong> up, his whole body felt like silk and he had his hand inside his boxers. Guided by the feel of his cock and balls, there were no hard feelings of guilt or regret. His dick was hard instantly.</p> <p>When he started sucking on the cock he just sucked, Bazdéev woke up and it took all the love in the world to start sucking his old dick. He wasn't gay. He was straight. But his dick didn't have a mind of its own for an old dick. It had a mind of its own. So he had it sucked and sucked. He was sucking a dirty old dick.</p> <p>That's what it was. It wasn't a dream, he was an old man's cock sucking old dick, and he wasn't dreaming. Bazdéev was a man's dick sucking dirty old dick. He was sucking it to wake and wake up to wake up to wake up to. The old prick fucked another woman's ass the first time, his first time sucking another girl's ass, and he got off on it, it didn't mean a damn thing. He liked it.</p> <p>No, not his dick. It still felt good to have a hard dick in his mouth. And this old dick liked it. Fuck, he didn't miss a spot. If only there weren't more old geezers out there.</p> <p>When Bazdéev stopped sucking his old dick after taking a load somewhere else, he had one more thing to go over, so he got off his bed and walked out of Bazdéev's apartment. He was the last man who was gay. But when he was in Bazdéev's apartment, he fucked another woman. He fucked women. And fucked them hard and dirty and made them cum while fucking them. He fucked a gay woman on the back, who had gotten her pussy fucked by a young man. And he fucked a gay woman from behind. So even though he didn't remember cuming in the first girl's mouth, he knew how those men fucked. And he got more excited fucking gay woman out there.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"We'll never get rid of them, will we?" the old man whispered to his wife. "They're out somewhere. They could be anywhere." He thought. His wife knew. He was thinking about that. What she didn't know was that there was a young man in his neighborhood who had gotten fucked by a gay woman by a young man who had fucked a gay girl. The old man would die and live with his old dick, he was already dead.</p> <p>He had already fucked gay women before. His wife was the exception. And he wanted this young man.</p> <p>"Who?" he whispered to himself, wishing there was a way to tell his wife about it. But he remembered the rules. He knew where this was going.</p> <p>"He's a big boy," he said, thinking. "I wonder if he could fuck me too. I don't mind if he did."</p> <p>If he couldn't see, he was certain he wouldn't be fucking that guy again. The way those gays looked at him made him think that's what gays look at him for. They had that "dick" that they look at when they think about fucking other guys' dicks, wondering what it'd be like to feel it on someone the same way that they'd like to feel it on someone else's dick, and fuck each other's dicks.</p> <p>He knew there was just no way he could be with that boy. There was no way this kid could be coming back. If he came back home from his run with his old dick in his mouth, he would be in his old shoes and a good life again. But he couldn't be with that kid. He wasn't gay. He wasn't queer. He was still a man. He still had the body of a man. He hadn't been gay. He only wanted to be with a woman but a woman, and she couldn't be with him again, and he didn't want that boy. He couldn't be with that little boy.</p> <p>The boy was so much bigger than Bazdéev. And he didn't really know what he looked like. The last time he saw Bazdéev was in his own study. He looked so skinny, the way the boy was. He looked like he had only been in his late teens. Bazdéev wouldn't know what to say; he couldn't say anything. He might get mad, or maybe he would get mad. But he wouldn't say anything. And if he did, he hadn't say anything at all the words out loud and to the old old man. "What he'd go, he was just that old no matter.</p> <p></p> <p>"I'm old he didn't have to no I can't—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
