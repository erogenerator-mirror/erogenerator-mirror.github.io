It is not Archie, I am sure, who would like a ball,” said Mrs. Rowland from the sofa, where Eddy had been sitting by her, in an attitude</strong> of total comfort.</p> <p>"You're beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you," she replied, blouse and bra falling to the floor by the sofa and legs spread. Her blue skirt and dark panties were hanging from her left leg so her panties were bunched, which was a pity, as they'd been so recently soiled, as were her white thigh high stockings.</p> <p>Her legs were long and well shaped and shapely, and, as I had discovered, they looked like they were used to the gym. Eddy was an attractive woman as well, but there was something extra to her.</p> <p>"That's okay, you looked great."</p> <p>"Thanks," she answered. "You were nice enough to lend me your beer. I liked that."</p> <p>"Well, thank you for being nice to me; but then again, I could probably do that many times."</p> <p>"Well, thanks for coming over." She smiled. "The weather is starting to get kind of warm in Atlanta."</p> <p>"No problem." I picked up the remote control and pressed pause. "There's nothing to do."</p> <p>I stood and watched her. Even with my back to the TV, I could see her panties clinging to her legs and showing her nicely shaved pussy lips. She looked at her breasts while I stood.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go?" I asked as it was time for her to leave.</p> <p>"Yes, please."</p> <p>In the back of my mind I wondered how many of my buddies in high school and college thought that's how they felt when they saw me naked in the hallway in gym class.</p> <p>I heard the door lock sound and walked back to her. She turned and we faced each other and kissed passionately. When she pulled my shirt off, we went to the livingroom.</p> <p>"I'm starving," I said.</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>We sat down on the sofa. I placed my hands on her thighs before she began kissing my thighs. She opened the button on my shorts to reveal that I wore the blue boxers I'd been wearing for that class; and she had already touched me with them. I felt my cock swell. She was so beautiful to me.</p> <p>I kissed her mouth while my hands were exploring her body. I was pleased by the sight of her nipples, even a little tanned, standing at attention. She tasted wonderful and I felt her mouth move against mine as I explored her mouth.</p> <p>I felt her hands on my erection and I stopped her when she'd unbuckled my belt; my zipper coming down as she did so. She tugged my underwear away and her touch was heaven. I lifted her onto the sofa so I could enter her easily. God, she was wet. I was already getting aroused because of my experience with her. She was definitely wet as well, because she could apparently feel the hardness of my cock as she sat.</p> <p>She reached down and wrapped her hand around my cock while I was sliding in and out of her. When she squeezed my cock, it felt so good.</p> <p>She broke off our kiss and began to undo the buttons on her blouse, revealing those breasts. I began kissing and gently biting them while she continued to stroke my cock. I felt myself getting close and I tried to focus so she could finish me off with some pleasure.</p> <p>"Can I kiss you?" I asked.</p> <p>She kissed me and pushed back her head. Her kisses were heavenly, soft and gentle in contrast with the hardness of my cock.</p> <p>"Please," I said.</p> <p>She looked at me and nodded. She kissed my bare lips, followed by my tongue through her mouth. Her lips felt so good. I tasted her tongue along with her mouth, which seemed to have more energy.</p> <p>By the time she was finished with me, I was about to push her away, but she stopped me and said,</p> <p>"No, don't."</p> <p>I couldn't. She'd already let go of me, and what was I supposed to do when I wanted to do something else?</p> <p>"Please," I said.</p> <p>"No, Eddy," she said.</p> <p>What could I do? She looked up at me from time to time. She was trying to think of an excuse or an excuse to finish me off with kisses or a blow job or a caress or, well, anything that had to do that.</p> <p>not the first time. in. The wrong not. to no</p> <p>when. Then! But</p> <p>.
