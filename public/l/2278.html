Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter, and arrange a room,</strong> a wedding, a life, and live again to love again. In the middle of the first page; Isabella wrote ‘I love you so much’ and I was born again.</p> <p>*</p> <p>It would just be a few more weeks before the ceremony was to begin, and a little more talk was needed to assure my acceptance of this new life within my own family. My aunt was coming into town, and we wanted to keep her out of our way. We also wanted some rooming arrangements before they returned. My father agreed to help me, because I was still in the process of finishing my degree. I would go back home, start my own “pro-vials” business and settle in the apartment that I had been renting here for years. What better way to return what I had started than to stay in a place for a year with my wife, and be with friends? It wasn’t long past my graduation.</p> <p>After the ceremony was over in the hotel suite, I went down to the bar with Isabella. She introduced herself, and we began to dance, and soon we were both stripped down to our underwear. Isabella’s hair smelled of roses, and, without hesitation, I began to suck and bite her nipples. I loved it when she came; but now it was my turn to be as horny as she was. She began to massage my crotch, and she ran her fingers through my short hair as I was rubbing her body. My fingers explored the small of her back, and then her butt as she continued to rub. She had put on a strap-on on the bed. With the other arm around me, and her leg over mine, she held me tight as she began to buck. I kissed her neck as she bucked, and we came together, my hands and my lips feeling her trembling body on mine. She was shaking uncontrollably, and she told me to lay down and she would do the honors. After her on top of me, she moved her hand between her legs and felt my erection, then moved it to her pussy. It was wet – she’s not as excited as I am. When she took her mouth from my cock, I said I enjoyed her experience and I would do what she wanted. She was all I ever wanted. As she put the head into her pussy, I pushed all the way into her before she took me out again, and began to fuck herself with the dildo.</p> <p>She got on top of me, and I lifted her hips. She moved in slowly. Slowly and deliberately. She loved it. Slowly – her ass was so tight and perfect for fucking. I could see that she was near the edge. I took both hands and pinched her nipples, and rubbed hard. She screamed as she came. She continued to fuck me. This was too much for me. I got hard again, and she asked me to get off her. Then she took my balls into her mouth and began sucking; making sure she had my whole erection down her throat by the way she used her tongue. She knew my weaknesses and I knew hers. With no ceremony, she impaled herself with what would be the biggest, most wonderful cock that I had ever experienced. We were both moaning as she fucked my cock into her body. Her fingers were rubbing her clit, and the feelings of fullness and wetness were all she had ever known. I couldn’t keep fucking her. I had to cum. I wanted it to stay within her. She took her mouth off my cock and slid down over it, and took all of it into her warm, wet, sucking mouth just as my cock exploded with passion for her.</p> <p>We were both panting and exhausted before she got up on the bed and laid on her back, so I could have a go at her. I took her ass, and I could feel how wet she was. We laughed. I went up her back as she continued to play with her clit. As I moved up over her, my cock found her mouth again, and I kissed her again. We lay together and kissed, and we said our goodbyes until the morning. I made love to her the next time we were apart—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
