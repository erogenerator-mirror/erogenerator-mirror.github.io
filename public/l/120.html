Five Years Later</h4><p><strong>Tellson’s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It</strong> was very hard to fit a single one of those large books into the bookcases. When they did eventually break the heavy wooden floor, it wasn't much, but the furniture wasn't that bad either. The main difference was the carpet.</p> <p>The one thing that could possibly be more familiar was the big man's big dick. The man's dick was bigger than the two guys in the big bookcases. The third guy's name was a short poem. The poem was 'I'm getting closer,' the poem was 'I'm going down,'</p> <p>I can't keep my hands off of that cock or anyone else.</p> <p>As I got closer, I was thinking: it would be very easy to give up on the cock. It might just take a few minutes to get to the other end of the cock. Maybe a few minutes of watching the guy go down made me start to jerk off. It had to do with the way it looked. It looked like the other end of the shaft. Maybe that was the end of the cock, as the others had made the cock look like that. As I began to look at the cock closer, I realized that my mouth was watering and my body was tingling. It was one of the cocks I'd jerked off when I was at the library. I felt that I wasn't gay.</p> <p>It was only a few weeks before when the library had a huge gay bar. As I sat there looking at cocks, I felt a bit like a faggot. And I don't mean the cocks here and there in the library. It was just that some guys were on the cocks, so the others were too. There were a lot of good looking guys around here. And I don't know what any of those guys were wearing. I mean that would be my choice of underwear. I was just a kid in a bookstore. I was just in a bookstore. And I couldn't even get to a fucking gay bar.</p> <p>A few people came in and sat down at the bar, but most went in the opposite direction out of the same aisle. We always sat in the middle, which is a bad choice on some people's part of a book, but it's very convenient. The bookcase really got to me. I mean, most guys came in here every half hour, and even the gay guys came in a couple of hours later. I was really getting hot. There was something special about being a boy instead of a girl, like I'd always had before, not like I was a gay guy, then of course I couldn't even stand to put my dick in someone's mouth, and then only a few guys came in, so it was nice.</p> <p>I was already feeling pretty hot. It had been one very long day just sitting here, staring at those cocks and looking at them. I had got the feeling that if I gave up sucking on anyone but the big dicks, then it would be nice to have a girlfriend instead, but if I gave up on the cock and did the fucking, they might be nice to get back to the library. But I didn't want to talk about it. I wanted to just feel like I was a boy again.</p> <p>So I sat there and watched the scene at the bar. There were three guys sitting there. The third guy was a bit more of an ass but I'd thought of that as a gay guy, not a man. I mean he was just a kid out there who'd just been on a date with a man.</p> <p>One of the guys in the big guy's bookcase sat close to the guy in the bookcase, and I didn't care. Just watching the guys sitting there with the gay men made me even hotter.</p> <p>My nipples were hard and I was feeling hot. I hadn't worn a bra since I got back from school and I was thinking about what we might do in there. But it was a library book. No panties. I could get caught, but then I'd only have to sit there by myself. I could do that without turning around. If I sat there by myself then I could pretend that I was a girl and didn't know that. There was a bunch of other books out there to read and I couldn't get away.</p> <p>Anyway, I'd just had this moment of pure pleasure, and all the other thoughts running through my head were so many other things. If there was anything I would rather have done than have my nipples touching the guy in the bookcase, the fact that I sat there by myself didn't change that. I'd do it. I'd do anything.</p> <p>As I watched the three guys getting together in the room a little more, the third guy was getting ready to take a bit more, I was getting more nervous. I was starting to turn. The way to see what I thought that he'd be gay guys, see it and do what—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
