Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not stood near Louisa, who held</strong> him in a strong embrace for a moment, before he turned to face her with tears rolling down his cheeks, and a smirk upon her lips.</p> <p>He'd known she'd always been beautiful, but now she held his heart in her hands, with just the right amount of warmth, love and caring he was already smitten by her.</p> <p>"It just shows that you can feel a lot about me," he explained, feeling her lips on his shoulder. "So don't let me take everything off." They had already begun stripping each other.</p> <p>"I didn't think this would ever happen," she giggled, brushing the tip of his nose with her lips.</p> <p>"Oh, no," he said, lifting up her shirt to expose the most perfect pair of breasts Louisa had ever loved.</p> <p>"And this is why," she grinned, running the palms of her hands along his broad and muscular shoulders, causing him to shiver. Then she slid her hands down his hips, past the bulge of his crotch, and into his trousers on the other side. They continued for a moment longer between their kiss, before their fingers were already making their way inside.</p> <p>"Can I take these off," Louisa asked, pulling her hands out of his pants, and kissing the palm.</p> <p>"Nooo," he moaned, then he gave her breasts a quick squeeze. "You said you wanted me to just fuck you."</p> <p>"Aww," she smiled, running her hands up the sides of his cheeks, before pushing him back so that he fell back on the bed. "You know, we can be a lot more intense about this if you promise not to get turned on by that." With a wink, Louisa turned away from him and began undoing the buttons of her shirt.</p> <p>He took his shirt off, feeling her lean back against the bed for a moment before her fingers began undoing the buttons. Once they were open, Louisa slowly undid the rest of her shirt, revealing a pair of matching blue lace bra's. Still holding up her shirt, she let it slide off until it hit the floor. By the time she had slid her pants down, she had removed both of her knickers, and she was now straddling him, her feet up on the mattress.</p> <p>"My turn," she purred, her hand running along her wet and exposed sex.</p> <p>"If you insist," he responded, lowering his body so that it was poised at the edge of the bed above her.</p> <p>"I don't know about doing anything with you," she smiled, feeling a twinge of desire course through her limbs until she was unable to resist.</p> <p>"You know, I'll help you figure it out," he grinned, sliding his finger tips along the length of her slick sex. "I'm pretty sure we can give each other something to think about while I'm out the door."</p> <p>"Okay," she smiled, looking seductively into his blue eyes before closing her eyes and pushing her fingers through the folds while arching her back. She arched as she felt his fingers brush, then gently enter, in her, sending a jolt of electric bliss through her body.</p> <p>"Hmmmmm," was all the reply he got before he started kissing his way down her neck, to where her breasts were exposed before him. With his hands firmly clasped on her left breast, he slowly lowered his lips onto her nipple, taking it between his lips before releasing it with a loud slurp. He could feel the hardness of her areola as he laved it with his tongue. Then he began moving his way down, his tongue moving across, causing her to moan softly. As his lips travelled down her stomach, he felt her warm and wetness on his face as he continued trailing circles around them with his finger.</p> <p>She was beginning to enjoy the attention, and she couldn't help but think that something had always made her happy. That feeling of trust had come from somewhere within herself when his soft fingers had felt the need for something different, from something that had always made her wish for something else. It was as if her life had always belonged to someone else, and something had always been special that someone, somewhere, could give it to her.</p> <p>As his lips worked their way further down her body, she reached behind her and began stroking his cock through his trousers. Not one to waste time on just sex, and just about all he'd ever had to get through the day, he didn't even have to hold on to his boxers to do so. He'd been ready to rip them off long enough from the heat of their sexual union to get at that point that he could have her, and she'd have her, but they didn't, come together for ever in any where they would. He'd have something to make their way to be together.</p> <p></p> <p>Sheâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
