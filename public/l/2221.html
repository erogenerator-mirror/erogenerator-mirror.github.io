We'd made the biggest asses of our lives...except that I thought I was the only one who'd felt it up.</p> <p>We'd been having such a good time, so we went through the motions as usual: the boat loaded and loaded up...and the boats loaded and loaded. We'd also had a blast with each other. Mr. Blandly said he'd done a good job of stashing his cock in my ass (if I wasn't already ass-fucked, of course!), a good job of holding my tits up from behind, making a nice cleavage for my face (and that's what he'd gotten me), and a great-grand impression and good wording...and of course in each other; he'd done so much of that. So nice of him to even think I wasn't a natural bottom. He'd pulled out a nice length of lube and a big rubber dildo, and then he'd slipped me into my best slut-muffin, which we'd also had a go with. The first round would have been a quick get-fucked, but he'd pulled out, stepped into the harness, and made me straddle the dildo with it, putting me in the middle.</p> <p>He'd had me lie back on the bed, on my back, then he'd slid his cock inside of me, and fuck my ass. He'd given me that dildo once or twice, after all, and it made me come three times. When you're in one or more climaxes, it has a different feeling to you.</p> <p>"Fuck," I said, as he'd slid out and climbed on top of me. He'd been hard as a rock after that, and I loved that it had given me such pleasure.</p> <p>"Fuck," I repeated, then "Fuck," when we came together. It wasn't the most intense climax, because it was more a shock; it just got over-stimulated and didn't really enjoy being so full. There were times where I wasn't sure if it would be that good; I felt like I was being tortured by an angry bull, and I didn't want to even do a double-dip. It was the only time I'd ever truly had an orgasm like that; all I could focus on was the pleasure. I'd also come the hard way the first time when he'd done it—not because I'd asked him to stop, but because I'd climaxed myself a time or two while I'd been thinking of how to make his friends—my friends—have their second mind.</p> <p>After that, it just kind of got more intense, and my favorite of all was "Ride Me!" The first time Mr. Blandly fucked me, he'd had me climb on top. He'd bent me forward; had me lean forward, and then he'd slid into my ass. We'd both come a third time that afternoon, all of us naked.</p> <p>He made it a point to leave me with a good hard-on (and some more time with those big boobs) while he was gone and I was ready, and he'd promised us a good time. We'd planned to fuck each other in our ass, but it felt so good to be so completely filled up and used that all I had to do was get a cock inside me first.</p> <p>He was back to working that rubber dildo in and out of my ass when he got back—just a few minutes after I'd come again. I had the chance to take a break, before we went in the opposite direction to the second of our orgasms. But I had him on his back beside me in one of the hotel room beds, and he'd started to work his hard-on between my tits. He'd taken it to a stride, and I'd started to work the dildo back and forth, between my boobs, while I kept the head of his cock in my mouth and my tongue working on it.</p> <p>He'd stopped fucking my tits, and I'd had my lips wrapped around the base of his dick, while he got the vibe in my ass to work on the clit of my friend. The other two girls were busy kissing while they watched, and I had a feeling I wouldn't be able to take much from that in a half hour, though I didn't really care. The cock in my mouth still felt wonderful, especially since I was sucking hard on it. I wanted a hard one too, so I had him sit up on the edge of the bed while I slid backwards onto my knees in front of him.</p> <p>He'd slipped his cock into my pussy with a flourish, and a few, "oh-h," and oneh-h-c-a-n-m-uh-uh-n-c-uh-em-l. It wasn't the first went into my ass—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
