A Learned Italian</h4><p><strong>Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired, Dantès almost carried him towards the window, in order to obtain a better view of his features by the</strong> way. Then it dawned on him that he was staring directly at the moon.</p> <p>No words spoken by the two as they walked to the window. Slowly, he lowered his hands and looked out over the vast landscape. He thought he saw people in other countries, but he was still in England.</p> <p>Suddenly, she came and pushed him back against the solid stone wall. She stood over him and smiled up at him. Then, she dropped to her knees in between his legs and slowly started kissing him, as the moon and stars in front of him glowed faintly against the black clouds.</p> <p>Her hands roamed up his body and she kissed his jaw and forehead, then neck and upper chest. Her hands kneaded the muscles of his chest and legs. His cock twitched in her hand and rose within her grasp.</p> <p>Slowly, she took the rigid tool into her and started stroking him, her soft fingers making little circles around the base of it. Then, she stroked it up and down, in a long, deliberate motion, making small movements with her fingertips. Dantès eyes were shut in pleasure as she took much of him in her hand, while also stroking him with her fingers and mouth.</p> <p>The moonlight made her breasts sway and her nipples hard and point. Finally, she wrapped her fingers tightly around his shaft and started jacking him off gently. Slowly, she brought him closer to her mouth, where she parted her lips and engulfed him. Now, the entire length of his cock slid into her mouth, until the head was in her throat. She held his whole prick there, letting him fuck her mouth with it. Dantès hands went to her breasts as she massaged them.</p> <p>She kept it up for a few moments, while her tongue swirled across his entire cock. Then, she opened her throat and slowly worked the whole length of his cock in and out of her mouth, moving it from side to side, while her lips locked around the base of it. She kept it there, deep inside her throat.</p> <p>Dantès hands roamed slowly over her breasts and up to caress and knead them. Then, she turned his hands beneath her to her nipples. Then, she squeezed her firm, breasts together and pushed them together. As he played with them, she caressed his thighs. He got a raging hardon, which made her smile. Finally, she stood again and slowly slid onto the bench of the bench, on her back.</p> <p>She knelt up on top the bench, spread her legs and sat on his prick. He put his arms around her middle and pulled her towards him so her hips rested on his groin. Then, he rubbed his cock up and down the inside and up to the head, while holding her naked breasts in his hands. Dantès thighs were spread apart and they both looked like two sex toys. She looked like a sex toy as she stared at his cock.</p> <p>The moon and stars shone in the window but not illuminating to his eyes. She kept teasing him like that. Then, he started thrusting his cock up inside her. Her breasts slid up and down his chest as she rubbed herself up and down his cock. Their coupling grew more passionate. When she pulled back his cock, he held the head against her pussy and held it there. Then, she pressed his hand to her pussy, in order to press her clitoris over his finger.</p> <p>He continued to thrust while squeezing her boobs, but his penis was too sensitive to remain inside her. She pushed the tip of his penis against her clitoris, moving her clitoris over the end of it so that it was rubbing over the end of his cock, every so often. He had to hold her breast as tight as he could and hold them there until she pushed them down to mash them around his shaft.</p> <p>She was in ecstasy, as her face got red and she moaned in sheer pleasure. Then, she slowly pulled away, moved her hips all around in slow circles. Then, she stood up, removed her robe, pushed it to the side and then spread her legs and stood up on the bench, still fully naked. She took his cock in one hand and put it at her cunt.</p> <p>Slowly, slowly, she impaled herself, taking as much as she could of it each time, as he did his in her. She looked at his face as she moved up and down. She looked so sexy as she impaled herself on him. Her body shined in the moonlight with her face still held together in ecstasy. She stared at his face, while she moved her hips moved and rubbed against him. She was so beautiful as she made love into every stroke. It made him feel as he thrust his cock all time.</p> <p></p> <p>in his shaft entered her. She knew she began to move as he started to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
