The time of a man’s life is as a point; the substance of it ever</h4><p><strong>flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so</strong> profound, so profound, so profound in every moment of eternity. As soon as the words came out, his eyes were glued tight as he envisioned in his mind what that mouth of hers would feel like on his cock; the feel of those lips that would taste like cream, cream of honey.</p> <p>As soon he said the words, they were to him: the joy of love, of the joy of youth; and of sex, and innocence, and ecstasy; love as ancient, as art, and as the holy grail of youth. And of her, as he envisioned the ecstasy of youth, and her youth.</p> <p>When he saw her name in his mind, his heart skipped a beat.</p> <p>--A/N: For your comments - e-mail|>Chapter 02 - Life of the Heartbeat</p> <p>The days rolled by. Their relationship had never been the greatest, but had become more exciting and more meaningful in the past few months. She began to see him more and more frequently, and soon began to consider the world in such a different light. She had always wanted to be a lesbian.</p> <p>Her sexual orientation, as she had been told many times, was that of the sissiest, sexiest, most depraved, wildest, most passionate woman you've ever met, ever known, or of any woman you'd ever met. She couldn't believe she had allowed his cock to go down her throat. A secret and shameful secret she only had to keep her legs together; only to pull his big cock down her gorgeous legs and fuck him.</p> <p>As a former high school basketball and rugby player, he'd always found her fascinating. A beautiful young woman with curves, full, firm breasts, big round breasts, and long, luscious legs. She was a dream.</p> <p>A few nights each month passed more by, and more and more and more. He watched her sometimes as she passed the door to her room, but she never came inside. She never made a sound. Never had she stopped to turn one way or another, just stared for a minute at him, a beautiful, dewy smile on her lips, her eyes. Her mind was always filled with thoughts, dreams, and desires.</p> <p>They'd been living together since he'd left school. There wasn't any sexual electricity in the relationship. They always had been just friends, although the sexual energy had always been palpable. Now it was all a little different; more intense, more intimate.</p> <p>His mother had been the first to say 'no'. When she'd first mentioned her interest in him, she'd just asked him to put his hand on her body and have "treating" with it. She'd had to stop him, even had he pulled up his t-shirt to expose his full, hard-on.</p> <p>That had all but destroyed the friendship she still had with Mike. His father had been too busy working the ranch to give his mother a lot of time with him. And she was too busy with her family. In spite of his best hope of finding someone who thought she was different, there was no substitute for her.</p> <p>They kept in touch by phone and in the mail; often he'd write her a letter or write to her in person. Their relationship had gone from a friendship to a long-lost love. That thought had been burned into her mind and as he and she met, he could feel what it was like.</p> <p>She had also known the truth of a man. She hadn't meant to hurt him, at least emotionally. But as time went on, their relationship developed. He saw her through the mirror: beautiful, beautiful, beautiful; and alluring. And that was exactly what he wanted, what he'd always wanted.</p> <p>And as their relationship slowly progressed, neither could take the distance any more. He had taken charge. And he wanted to go back to her. Her, his.</p> <p>She'd taken to his letter from her desk, waiting for his reply. He'd always liked that part of this "treat", but had always felt a need to make sure her "sister" received the message.</p> <p>For several weeks, neither had talked. She'd gone to talk with him about her life, with what she'd hoped for from him. The way he'd felt about her had been important. She'd always been a "daddy's girl"; he had always treated her just like a child; never taking it to the extreme. He saw her as a girl, and she didn't need to be treated as such.</p> <p>Now he saw her as his daughter. And that made him want it even more. Her hair was long, dark, and full, she had the most of alluring; but straight and lustrous. His hand was everywhere. He'd been everywhere else held on her like a hand too, and her neck, like a big, a part—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
