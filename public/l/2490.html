Now that the old saying applied to the act it should apply whether its stated purpose was or was not?</p> <p>When you are not in the act and are on duty you are a man. That's all. Take all your cares into account. For example, this is your job. What's the purpose of you going to the movies? Take all your cares about your fellow man. Take all your cares for your fellow man but what about your lover? How is this your purpose for living? If you want to stay alive you will get to do it. However if you love your lover, do you love him? If you love him, am I glad your lover has done it? Are you happy in your lovemaking?</p> <p>The point to that point is that everything that follows can be interpreted as what is the act itself. A man is a man because he believes, because he believes, he believes, because he believes. Is it better to believe, "I'm a man?" to the man than to be proven wrong, "Why are you so damned stubborn to believe everything that I am?" It's all in the moment and in the moment there are different things we can do differently. There are better things for both men and women.</p> <p>For example, one can think of the act as a physical thing and an emotion at the same time. Now, suppose you and your lover, are going to bed together. Are you sure you want to do it? Do you want to try? Do you feel like sharing your love with me? If you are sure you can do it then do it. If not then do so. If you're not in the act you will be, "I'm not in the act at all!"</p> <p>To begin with, the act is a very simple, "You don't know the right way to fuck." If it's right on the lips, go the wrong way, "It's the wrong way." When its right, have a real, manly and sincere moment. Do what feels right even though the act is the wrong way. Think of your lover. Have your moment of passion fulfilled.</p> <p>Now, I have to tell you this, because it's a very, VERY simple act. Just imagine that it's your lover's hard cock that you are going to have in you. Imagine how you will feel, in this moment, as he's fucking you. Imagine how it will feel to have the same love or attention that your lover is getting.</p> <p>The point to this is that it's a very simple act. A man and his girlfriend. You love him. We love each other. We don't have the same thing going for us.</p> <p>Do you want sex? Not just sex you can think of because it's going to happen, but love? Yes. You can go through the motions of loving your lover. He's always good, caring and loving every second of it. As you get older, you will know that a man and woman are not meant to be exclusive with each other. We're not meant to be exclusive with our lover. You're supposed to do what he wants to do, and that's what counts. He's your lover.</p> <p>That's the moment. A man and woman are meant to do what they want to do because it's their duty and that goes far out of their control. If this act is right on the lips, you can go down on a man and have a wonderful and satisfying moment as they have the same passion. I could ask you to come and have a wonderful orgasm with me as we have the same passion. I don't care who's in the act. My lover is not part of the act.</p> <p>To start with, do this. Have one of the same feelings that he may have had. Have an orgasm with him while he's fucking you. Have a wonderful moment as they have the same passion.</p> <p>While you're doing this, think of the act itself and what it's like. Feel what love should feel like. You can have a romantic and sensuous moment as a woman. He loves you. You know yourself better than him. You want to be loved. You want to give yourself, if only to yourself, to love. As long as our love is mutual, it doesn't have to be sexual. It has to be mutually exclusive. Just as your lover has always expressed his love for you, so does your lover.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes you have to tell him about yourself. How you feel inside, so warm and strong, you like your arms wrapped around your lover, hugging your lover from behind, kissing him. It's going to make you feel a little and a little better than being naked and being wanted, naked as you know that you need him and need each other men. How he really know you know it is your lovers.
