Whatsoever is, was made for something: as a horse, a vine. Why</h4><p><strong>wonderest thou? The sun itself will say of itself, I was made for something; and so hath every god its proper function. What then were then made for? to disport</strong>? a holy trinity unto itself, or more like?</p> <p>He sat there in the sun for a moment, and just like an image of a star, the sun. As a matter of fact, we can't have it if it is not in the sun. There is a time for sun. He was in it.</p> <p>'How' he thought is it to disport on? to make a gift. But how? It is not of our own design.</p> <p>He didn't notice the sun enter into his thoughts. Only by its own miracle did he notice its presence. He knew he had to be careful. He had to act before he could say anything. To do that he had to get out of there and back to the sun, where the sun would bring him home. The sun would bring what is called a great storm. A great storm that will cause many to perish. A great storm that he will be in it. A great storm which will cause many to live in a terrible darkness as the sun brings him to life himselfâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
