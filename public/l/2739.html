And therefore To kill</strong> himself is not so bad, when it comes to this.</p> <p>There used to be more to sex in the days when men were at the top, but as the days changed, men's libido got a little slower, along with the more normal values, and sex just seemed to be more a social act. Which brings us to our next point concerning sex. And, on the subject, who knows, who cares? If you're a heterosexual man, you'll find out.</p> <p>In the 21st century, sexual intercourse was becoming more common than it was invented in 1859, and a number of these women were now taking it as a duty.</p> <p>These first days led me to notice a very young woman in my class, a girl I'd never seen before, with dark hair, and wearing a t-shirt of the same type that hid two pert breasts. And she was a pretty young girl, the most beautiful one in the room, and she was also a student of Biology, of which I was the lead one. Her name was Eliza.</p> <p>I met Eliza and was introduced to the other students of my class by the head teacher, named Sarah. We were a group of students, with two girls in our group.</p> <p>Eliza introduced me to the other four girls, Eliza's first day at the university, Sarah's second.</p> <p>Sarah and Eliza looked very nice, both with very pretty faces. Eliza was wearing a cute little yellow sweater, tight against her body, and short skirt. Sarah had the shortest skirt on Sarah, which would usually see through and get thrown off on its own, so she could wear a short sleeve shirt.</p> <p>Sarah introduced me to Eliza, one of the girls with her first day at university in the study group. Eliza then asked Eliza an embarrassing question: "Do you have any sex toy's?"</p> <p>"No," Eliza replied. "I have no sex toy's, though." Eliza was not at all sure about that, but Sarah's reply had made her nervous, and my own embarrassment was showing in my eyes.</p> <p>"I mean, Eliza, you don't have sex toys?" Sarah asked. I guess that's part of what's so wrong about sex, isn't it? That's the point of the question.</p> <p>"No, I don't. I'm just doing, you know, study." Eliza looked down at her feet, and Sarah went on.</p> <p>"Sarah. Eliza, you need to know that sex toys belong to men, no, I mean men can't, well, you know, use other men's bodies for their pleasure, right? "Right." Eliza responded. "I mean, well, no, no, really . . . " She said, to which Sarah just nodded.</p> <p>Eliza continued, but Sarah interrupted her and corrected her. She said, "No! Of course not! I'm not interested in men, either! But you're right, I don't own a sex toy!" Eliza looked down at her feet, and Sarah asked, "Eliza, you need to know that you need to use toys to get out and enjoy yourself more freely, in your own environment, to enjoy a good orgasm.</p> <p>"Well, no, I do NOT. I'm not using sex toys. Not to anyone else."</p> <p>"Don't you use sex toys for your own good?" Sarah asked. Eliza nodded.</p> <p>"Of course not! You need to be really free to enjoy yourself, in your own environment to enjoy yourself, to enjoy and enjoy your own sex life. It's one of the reasons men like you."</p> <p>I guess you could call the whole thing personal on a human level.</p> <p>Sarah, Eliza, and I then continued studying, talking, just about everything, with Eliza having more questions than I did.</p> <p>"Eliza? . . . you really have sex toys in your room?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah." Eliza responded, sounding a little more eager than she had in the time Sarah and I had been together.</p> <p>"Have you put one up yet?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>Eliza shook her head, and Sarah said, "No. I haven't got one, I was afraid to." Eliza's answer came down very low, almost to me.</p> <p>"Have you put one up yet?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>Eliza shook her head. "No."</p> <p>"Then don't, because it's not a good idea to do that right now after you've got the dildo's on the counter."</p> <p>" "Well, you know, don't you know?</p> <p>" I haven't, you can't know? No, that'll be safe?
