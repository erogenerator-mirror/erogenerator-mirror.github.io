You feel yourself get aroused if you can find the pleasure, you think. Cicero says, “Yes, we shall. This will become a ritual of my choosing.”</p> <p>“You see, Cicero, that perhaps our first act is not only of our first consummation but, even better, rather than the beginning of anything, we have the gift of each other’s knowledge of the other’s body.”</p> <p>Cicero and his wife, both naked, step up from the table and enter the room. Together, they enter our bedroom. The light is a little dimmer; Cicero is facing the door. He kisses her passionately. She melts into his kiss. He moves in the kiss. His penis slides in her vagina, while the tip of his penis is resting on her clitoris. The warmth of our mouths on each other’s mouth is great. Then they begin to move, as one, moving against each other, and the tempo of the thrusting goes on and on. Cicero’s cock is pressing between her vagina, rubbing her clitoris.</p> <p>“This is better the first time is it not?” Cicero whispers in her ears.</p> <p>She replies that it is much better.</p> <p>“And this is more than the first time,” Cicero whispers back.</p> <p>“Mmmmmm...”, she answers between kisses.</p> <p>“I’m glad that you want to try this with your husband,” Cicero says.</p> <p>You must ask it of me, she responds; you must ask me my own.</p> <p>“Yes, you’re my own. But I do not like to do it alone.”</p> <p>“Of course, darling.”</p> <p>“Why should I like to do this? I’m doing it for my husband. We’ll see why it works when we see how we can make it work.”</p> <p>“Perhaps you should tell me, while you fuck you. Tell your husband what you like.”</p> <p>I look at your cock, then at Cicero’s, then back at the floor. I am amazed and am fascinated by this scene of two people fucking, both naked, a couple. My own penis is quite engorged. Cicero and his wife, looking like a pair, are looking at me, smiling and talking. Cicero, who has been fucking her slowly, looks at Cicero, then back to the floor. She has told him what to do, and he does that. He is moving his penis fast into the vagina of Cicero’s friend.</p> <p>I have to get out of this room. I’m standing on the other side of the room. What is left of my clothes is hanging up on the hook by the door. I hurry to get my clothes on but, still standing in the open doorway, I cannot stand still. Suddenly my penis is out of the confines of my shorts and I take myself in hand to pull my penis back. I look down and see Cicero and her friend, both naked, on the floor, being fucked, at Cicero’s feet. Cicero has her leg hooked over Cicero’s shoulder and Cicero has her nipple in both of her fingers. I cannot stand still. I can not leave the house. I don’t know how far my own arousal is, but my penis throbs. I close my eyes and let my hands fly, trying to get rid of it, but my penis will not obey. My hands fly over my head and down my legs. I know I am excited, and I am not ready for this. I think that if I continue like this, I will be able to fuck Cicero again. I try to pull away from Cicero but my penis stays in place.</p> <p>As I begin to pull myself out of the room, my penis is out in plain sight. Cicero and her friend and Cicero’s friend both walk out of the room and start walking down the hallway. Cicero opens the door, turns to Cicero. She looks at me, smiling.</p> <p>“Come.” She is on the bed with Cicero on top of her and their bodies are touching.</p> <p>I am on the bed and Cicero is on top of me.</p> <p>“Do you want to go to my bed,” Cicero asks.</p> <p>I don’t hear the reply, but I will.</p> <p>“I’m hungry for you in the floor,’s my hands, my tongue—to eat.</p> <p>you?’ your tongue, and you.</p> <p>’—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
