The diplomatic corps and the Emperor</strong> of the United Kingdom prepared and directed the servants and hired musicians to perform some of the traditional Christmas ball in the great rooms. During one such performance, three hundred guests crowded the ballroom at nine on New Years’ Eve. The King was the host for the dinner and afterward he and the Governor for the Governor-Elect came to the ballroom and made the introductions.</p> <p>“Everyone who attends to the Governor-Elect,” greeted the Governor, looking down in embarrassment,” can have a grand day. Come and join the festivities of the Governor-Elect and the First Annual Regatta,” the Governor-Elect ordered.</p> <p>The crowd stood back in embarrassment and a moment later the King announced, “The First Annual Regatta is taking place at midnight…the guests are expected to attend,”</p> <p>He had said “the guests” and, in a moment that left the crowd aghast, the Emperor of the United Kingdom declared, “The guests are going to eat and drink…the Governor-Elect is going to dance,”</p> <p>So, at midnight the guests all entered the ballroom to discover some food and drink; a huge buffet was arranged in the front of the ballroom, as was the Emperor.</p> <p>The Emperor walked with the Count in his arm as he walked with The Count and The Count’s sister, Catherine who was standing beside the Emperor and a short little table with a champagne bottle and some champagne trays beside it. “Here's to all the parties in the Empire!” said The Emperor, as everyone cheered, and finally he led his entourage to the door and took them into the great hall and, behind The Count, the Emperor spoke with some dignacions in attendance and then said, as he opened the doors to the great hall that led into the huge chamber, all heads turned to look at The Count as the Count rose to his feet and took the Count’s hand, which The Count stroked across his temple.</p> <p>The Emperor led The Count to the side of the great chamber where, behind The Count’s arm, a servant entered wearing a green cloth and led The Count into the great circle of a room and through the portal which led to the Emperor’s bedroom.</p> <p>The Count smiled at the Emperor and then escorted The Count to the bed. He removed his cloth and lay back on the bed, allowing The Count to slide his fingers up and down and round the head of his cock. As the Count’s fingers moved up and down, the Count stroked his cock in rhythm to the sucking of the Emperor’s lips. The Count moved his hands to cup the Emperor’s breasts, then he massaged both, pinching his nipples between his thumb and forefinger and gently pulling on them before continuing to flick his tongue across the top of his shaft. Then, The Count moved his body over, and as The Count’s hands stroked up his thighs to the hairless, glistening shaft, The Count slid down and licked on the tip of His cock, the Emperor’s pre cum coating the surface of the crown. He lifted his left leg and spread his knees wide, lifting his chest, and putting his hands on the bed, his back arching. After licking up and down that huge shaft of the Count, The Count inserted His fingers into The Emperor's channel, the Emperor gasping at the tightness and the lubrication as The Count slid His fingers in and out. The Count’s tongue licked up and down, dipping inside the tight channel which tightened to accommodate the two fingers in it. Then The Count's mouth closed on the head, sucking and circling it and then, slowly, The Count moved from the end of The Emperor’s cock to the base, taking The hood of it between his teeth and pulling it taut with his lips while taking the head into his mouth. Then the Count moved from the base, His head turned to the Emperor and the head of His cock moved back to the Emperor, then back, up and down, side to side with the first few thrusts He was rewarded with a deep growl in the throat as</p> <p>the Emperor’s whole body convulsed and vibrated with a hard orgasm. He gripped The Count’s head in his hands and pulled on The Count’s hair which drew The Count’s face deeper into His cock. The Count continued licking, sucking, and circling His cock, then he moved His mouth away and moved the head towards the head of the Emperor’s shaft. As The Duke’s cock descended the Emperor was pulled The Count’s head back as high into his throat and thrust, so that The Count could lick and his cock’s were in the Emperor, sucking mouth and thrust and was pressed into the Emperor, thrust and the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
