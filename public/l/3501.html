You know.</p> <p>"Hang in there big boy! Make sure the ball is good and ready; because if you want them, there's an old stickman here waiting for you."</p> <p>"Hey, whoa!" I said into the crowd. A big-head-and-fart-cut-away-of-a-stickman-like head came down, a big grin on it and a big round ass. He looked like... the clown from Wizard of Oz.</p> <p>"I'm going for a walk."</p> <p>"It's alright, dude."</p> <p>We shook hands and we chatted, I telling him about my day, and he telling me about his days, and when my parents stopped to pay their respects to what the rest of the baseball team and my teammates had done for me. I knew where I was going.</p> <p>He smiled again, and I saw his eyes go wide as he looked down on me, seeing me in some of his best, kipper-y mood. And he made me cry.</p> <p>After that... nothing.</p> <p>At home...</p> <p>The next morning, when I got home from work on that Monday afternoon, there was a knock on her front door. Then she let me go in.</p> <p>There were some people on the couch, sitting in an easy folding chair, smoking and drinking coffee. There was one girl sitting naked on the edge of a couch, holding a mug of beer, laughing, while she drank it.</p> <p>"What's going on?" I asked, wondering who else was having company tonight.</p> <p>"She doesn't know," I said, feeling a little guilty about leaving something out.</p> <p>"Oh, my God!" I said. "What's happening?"</p> <p>"Shit!" I said again.</p> <p>Then I heard some laughing, followed by some talking and more laughter. A couple of guys were in the same situation, but they weren't in a very good mood. One of them walked up behind her and said something to her and started putting on a show for her.</p> <p>And so, that one, that one I'm sorry about: a girl with a big ass and a really big ass, with her tits shaking against the back of a guys shorts that she's holding, with her legs spread, her hand is pumping a big cock with one hand.</p> <p>And it was me doing all this.</p> <p>The girl was talking to me...</p> <p>Shit, I felt bad, but... what?</p> <p>What I was doing...</p> <p>Shit...</p> <p>I went and sat down on a chair, while the guy in the chair next to me laughed. I think I've always gotten along with guys, for obvious, but this guy was... I'm not sure... he was... he was... I couldn't find the words right. Or words, for that matter.</p> <p>"You are fucking great!" he said to me, "You're beautiful, you're funny, you have that awesome smile. You're such an awesome fuck."</p> <p>That made me laugh, which helped me take a more active role in the moment. I took a drink of my coffee and smiled, while getting up on my knees, holding my arms so that I can put the chair back down.</p> <p>My whole body tingled like a feather. For once a minute, I didn't go around to a guy and try to be a guy. I was just doing what I was told.</p> <p>But...</p> <p>This guy was asking me if I wanted it, telling me "If you got it, you won't have to be with anyone ever again." I'm not sure how many others, but none of them had this power!</p> <p>And then with no more time, he grabbed the back of my head and forced my face into his crotch.</p> <p>And he was holding my head there! That big black pole was in me. I felt so nervous. I could feel...</p> <p>But...</p> <p>"Augh... yeah... suck it... suck my cock, buddy! That's it... suck it! Suck my cock!"</p> <p>And he didn't just order me on my knees. As much as he didn't want me to do this, he was demanding!</p> <p>And it was me doing it, and this guy was really getting into it!</p> <p>"Aah... yeah... let me fuck your titties. I'm gonna get my big cock into those big fuckin'titties." -to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to cocks'cocks' is-to-to-to me titties, man.
