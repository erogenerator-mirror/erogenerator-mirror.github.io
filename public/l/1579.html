English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER V</h4><p><strong>Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed. “I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he began. “Excuse me... I thought I should find you,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, “that is, I didn’t mean anything...</strong>”</p> <p>“I don’t think you should think like that. I’m serious, Raskolnikovna. I really, really fucking like your cunt is hot! I mean that!” She had a very serious expression, one made for someone else. She was as serious as him and Raskolnikovna thought she was just teasing him, making fun of him!</p> <p>“I am so ready for that! You know what else!” she said, moving into his arms and kissing him again. Now this was the kind of thing that only a woman could do!</p> <p>He began taking off her clothes - her blouse, her skirt and her shoes - as they kissed. It was not, of course, that it was that she was doing it; it was how she felt after a man had fucked her in their bed. But her breasts, they seemed to do that right in their own world. She had no doubt that they had done it again and again! She had had one or two orgasms in a row, some very strong ones from one guy after another. Her clitoris had been a bit of a sore head but it had not been the end of it!</p> <p>He kissed down her body - she wasn’t going to protest. But the idea of making love made his cock hard! His hand found her clitoris - no, not like that - and he flicked it back and forth, making her tremble, making her feel quite alive. Her nipples were very hard and her pussy felt very sexy. Her clitoris responded to the touch, not just the tingling. She couldn’t imagine having a boyfriend again and she could hardly feel his lips on her pussy. She didn’t really understand what she was feeling.</p> <p>As usual with sex there was much anticipation: he had gone slow, not wanting to rush it. Maybe Raskolnikov had taken it easy, in fact, that one of these days he would have no problem doing her from now on. He did want to make love to her - but that had to be right; he simply didn’t know how right! He kissed her nipples for a minute and let his lips and tongue touch first one nipple then the other. She arched her back and put a hand on his head, holding him close; she didn’t expect that her clitoris was too hard to be touched.</p> <p>He was going very slowly; it was a matter of endurance and patience. She had to work the whole length of his penis into her, sliding it back and forth - it was going well. This time, just long enough to give her a feeling of being completely opened to him. This time, it was also well before he came to start her off. That was his most pleasure - as he knew the full effect of her responses to him - her clitoris responded to his erection in a very long way, even when it was not erect. The orgasm that she had with him could not be timed that well but he was too busy to try. This time - the second time she came.</p> <p>They were kissing again, he taking his time and giving her more variety in the way he pleased her. She was really liking this, really enjoying it and he was having the same effect. He was very well aware of the effect he had on her - a woman, after all! They had no plans in keeping this up, especially with a man of his age.</p> <p>After another short time they went outside and sat on a bench along with the others. The bench was so narrow that they had a good support for Raskolnikovna, Raskolnikovna Semyonovna, who was the only one who could move around the bench with her naked bottom on the front. Now, there was not much of her back to the bench except the part directly in front. So this was very low as she sat astride it. The bench had an incline to it and as she got accustomed to her position she was able to sit almost upright and take a much better position for her pussy on the bench.</p> <p>He took her hand and brought it to his penis, saying no, not yet. They could do this later. He bent forward, bringing his lips down on hers and sucking them both. He held her hand and began taking it out of his lap as he rose to his feet to start masturbating himself. She was not going to stop him now - and didn’t at all. She began to move her body in the other's hand, rubbing her clitoris her clitoris it's clitoris its other's fingers, stroking herself, feeling its own. He began to his penis, feeling it: she clits, sliding, the same like that of it's, feeling its own. He began to slide it as he did her own, feeling her body—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
