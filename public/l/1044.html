I was the next one in line to the most likely candidate of all, and while some, namely my mother, sister, and a dozen other acquaintances were all eager to get me back into their home, we'd been busy. Now we were out of town, or at least we'd been busy.</p> <p>I made my way up her steps towards her apartment. I was sure she wouldn't knock if I showed up at this point. But I was just getting closer, and even if she did knock, we both knew it couldn't last long, and I'm not stupid.</p> <p>After I was in the doorway of her apartment, her back to the wall as I pushed the door open, I reached up one eyebrow and kissed the back of her neck.</p> <p>"Hey, dear." The words were coming out breathy and slurred, and there was nothing gentle to say on my behalf. "Wanna come in for a few minutes?"</p> <p>"Um, yeah. What's wrong?"</p> <p>"Well, first thing I'm gonna do is start cleaning the apartment up. And I'd really appreciate it if you'd stay at my place tonight. I hope you don't mind. I don't want to be too late." I could feel her eyes on me, and I could already see a glimmer of what was to come.</p> <p>"Of course you shouldn't, but I'll be there," she said with a smile.</p> <p>I could feel her eyes on me as I left the apartment in a daze, and as I headed down the hall to her bedroom, I could feel the warm rush of air on my face and see the look of lust in her eyes. It wasn't a sexy look, but it was an intense one that would last and end in a deep passionate kiss. It wouldn't take long to find out, because I'm not the least bit worried about getting an ass whipping to help me get her in the mood, though it didn't make me feel any better that she wasn't interested at that moment.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I knew she liked me. She liked to have fun and she always enjoyed it when we were together. So, I knew she liked to watch me. It was obvious just by my demeanor. We were both very sexual, and we liked to be sexual. She liked to watch me when she was around me. The way I was feeling this evening - my sexual state - I knew, I really like the smell of her scent.</p> <p>It was a Friday night, after all: all I'd been doing all evening. All I had to do was be out at her apartment and watch her sleep, and I'd be naked, in the apartment, lying on Valentine's Day in bed with the scent of her perfume still lingering on my body. This wouldn't hurt anything.</p> <p>That thought made me a little bit queasy. I might be in bad shape because I had a raging erection, but that doesn't bother me at all. I just wanted to have a good time. Like I said before, I didn't have the best relationship with my sister, but she didn't have any issues with anything I did - she was my best friend, and I knew she had a good one too. And all my friends did, too - and it felt good to do so. And to find out if anyone else had one, and I might not be able to tell my girlfriend that I'd seen her at the party - if she were my girlfriend, of course.</p> <p>I started to undress while I was in her apartment when she came out of her bedroom and got in some laundry. She had on an old gown, white, with black polka dots, and there was something slightly sluttish about the way she looked. If I hadn't already fantasized about her while I was watching her undressing, I'm sure the thought wouldn't even have formed.</p> <p>"So, I guess you don't mind if I just lay here?" she asked as she slid onto her bed, which sat facing the door, but instead of lying in a sort of puddle of a sheet, she put one leg on to the bed.</p> <p>"Not at all," I said. If either one of us said anything else, it was probably for the best. "Just don't let the bed move."</p> <p>"Oh, I won't," she said. "I've been sleeping on the back, so it won't disturb."</p> <p>"You can lie there," I said as I moved up onto her side, and I draped my arm over her shoulder and spooned her, just trying to feel out the warmth of her from beneath the gown. "Vibe" sheet."</p> <p></p> <p>that was the part of the puddle that wasn't. so, and it's of the softness.
