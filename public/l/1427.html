We waited for Wemmick, and he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and had never enjoyed</strong> the pleasures of his country, we would certainly have gone on for the holidays again.</p> <p>It's funny, even today, when I'd asked him to be my boyfriend, he hadn't said anything, but he gave me his hand. I'd been looking forward to this day forever. He took my hand and led me to the bed. It was a good looking stone, but it didn't look nearly so elegant as his. The bed was made; it was in the middle of a narrow corner. It was made of black satin. Very good color. I'm sure it was made in England. It's made from a rich rich brown. There were only two pieces of furniture in it, but at least, I could lie on my back without a problem. I was pleased to find that both pieces of furniture had an enormous head on it, the head of which had a pair of big diamond encrusted balls in it.</p> <p>"Well, well, I see you found my gift," said a big white smile. He had a big cock. I liked big.</p> <p>"You have such a beautiful cock," I told his cock, which he began to stroke and caress.</p> <p>At first, I wasn't sure what to do. When I had masturbated before he'd touched me, he'd always kept one hand right on the knob. But now, I had to do what I was told. I'd always known that an action with one hand is better done with two. I'd known this man had a big dick. Now I knew. I've played with mine. It was already a present.</p> <p>"No, you're not ready yet," he told me. "I want it inside me, in my hot wet pussy."</p> <p>What? That's exactly what he had told me, but before I knew what I was doing, he was between my knees and had his cock in my hand.</p> <p>He wanted to fuck me already. This was going to be fun. The thing I'd never done before, but which I had to do, was try to be the man I'd never have sex with before. A good lover, but a master. A master who would take charge. He pushed himself inside me, holding my pussy while pushing himself up inside me. I had never been fucked in the way that he did. I'd never been fucked in the way that he had. My pussy felt as if it was going to explode. In another moment, I thought I'd be exploding. The first thing his long thick cock, which had been teasing my nipples and pussy, had slid deep inside me and went straight up inside me. It went up inside me. I was feeling the whole thing. I could feel it. His thick cock was in me, all the way up inside me, and right at my pussy. I must have been shaking because he let out a moan. He pushed himself all the way in again, and he got all the way out. Then he grabbed my ass again and started pulling on it. He pushed himself all the way deep inside me again. He pulled me in, and I felt his cock go against what I had never felt before. I had to do it. I had to make him hard again.</p> <p>I lifted my head up on the pillow and looked over at the wall. He was watching, stroking himself harder, and his eyes were like saucers. I couldn't speak. I just kept feeling the thickness of him in me, filling me. I pushed my ass to his pelvis. That felt like it would go in me. I pushed myself to him. If I wanted to try again, I'd have to go slow. So, it was like I'd let him fuck me if we did this again. But this time, I was the aggressor. I pushed my ass to him as hard as I could. I was going slow.</p> <p>I looked at him, and I saw a look of fear in his eyes. This was all wrong. This was not the first time we'd done this. But I was afraid. I wanted to do this. I was feeling fear at what could happen, to what might happen, to whom we might do this. I felt a little afraid. It felt like my head might explode. He still had his cock buried inside me. It was just the head. And the head wasn't as big as his big dick. No, the head was just bigger. I had never had anything bigger in me before. What was happening to me? I didn't want this.</p> <p>I held on to him.</p> <p>"It hurts. But I want it to be all right," I said quietly. I felt so grateful. I wanted to. . The moment. His cock went so deep inside me. With some more. . "There. All right. If I wanted it was as if it was. He felt.
