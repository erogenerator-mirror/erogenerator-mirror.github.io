And first of Systemes, which resemble the similar</strong> structure as my book: In order to better describe our society, and to better describe the current state of the system, let me introduce itself to a very personal being—the State of America itself!</p> <p>In my current form, my name, (and a little further) is Ephraim, so to get straight to the point, let me explain. My first name is Ephraim, or Ephius, or (as Ephius and I are in an age past.) The reason that I became a citizen was because I've got a sense of destiny (as well as that of a God), and therefore I am the embodiment of a cosmic force. It means that I have been given this identity by the cosmos himself. As with all my children, I shall refer to it as a "dirtiness". I shall say that it is a form of worship—the desire or the faith I feel for the Gods of the supernatural—my soul or the mind for the gods. I shall say that it is like the other forms of worship.</p> <p>When I was a mortal born in 1839, (and I say that as part of my history, the State of America was in 1879), I was assigned to a Church for our young adults (not a school for them) in the United States of America. A few days later, I was summoned to a Priestess' Church (where it became known as The Sanctuary), for a little more personal training. My name is Ephraim, and the Priestess is her wife, Saffron (sister). They were very important to me, to me, because Saffron had no children, and she had no responsibility in my life. She had my name and all that I needed to be the Goddess of my life, and then she would tell the Priestess of the Sanctuary to help me be Priestess of my life.</p> <p>Because of that, it is often difficult to understand whether the Priestess' faith in God is the Goddess of sexual energy, or whether the Priestess' faith in God is a product of the sex. Because the Priestess's faith in God is sexual, there are several different things. When the Priestess does worship a sex organ, she might say that she can't speak Greek or Latin, and that the Priestess should speak English or Arabic. Or she may say that the Priestess can't take her English or Latin and she is saying that when you speak the alphabet, you would speak the alphabet, that the Priestess is speaking the alphabet and the Priestess is being a person (or person). This, too, is often a good answer.</p> <p>However, the Priestess knows that I am not a priest, and if she says that, that is to say that I am not a priest. When she is told that it is me of the Holy Word, the Church, it is the only power she is called to feel. Her religion, the world, and the Holy God, all of that belongs to her. Thus, it is a wonder to me that as soon as we were old enough and married, she had the Priestess's faith.</p> <p>When I was a youngster, I had a sexual fantasy about being a Sister of the Holy Word. Now, as with the Priestess, I was not at all shy about the idea. It was not an erotic fantasy, but something to keep my mind off of that which I was not really sure of. My fantasies began with the Priestess and me (and my Priestesses) making love together. We did it for an hour or so, and it seemed to not only be good sex, but also very romantic also. We had made love in many positions before, and I had been very happy that it was the Priestess. She was also very attentive and skilled with her tongue. While on their knees, I could tell that she was giving oral to each and every one of my fantasies with the skill of a pro.</p> <p>We made love in this manner, of course, often without an orgasm, usually the Priestess would have a climax in the process and it would cause an ejaculation in the Priestess and her partner. After each orgasm, she would ask me for the Priestess's name, and if he did so, he would ask her to give his name to the Priestess, and she would know that his name was Ephraim. Sometimes when I was alone and in a group and others were looking at a movie, I would make the Priestess masturbate her tongue in my name, as I felt my own orgasm coming on.</p> <p>My greatest pleasure, while we had sex with Ephraim, was my own self-gratings. I made during our sexual intercourse. When I called her name or her as being the Priestess and was worship her, it was the Priestess, I went about to the Priestess, (which I would take the Priestess, I call—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
