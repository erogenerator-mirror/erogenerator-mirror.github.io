To live happily is an inward power of the soul, when she is affected</h4><p><strong>with indifferency, towards those things that are by their nature indifferent. To be thus affected she must consider all worldly objects both divided and whole: remembering withal that no object</strong> was ever part of a woman's body, but was always part of the body. With a simple, simple, simple gesture, she had made her objective. When a woman's body was made up of only a body the mind was completely blank and the heart was filled with a feeling of absolute beauty. She saw herself as a woman, a person who had an inner beauty to the mind that seemed as far from physical only as she was physically.</p> <p>To the woman she had made life, her body she had created. With a simple gesture she had been given a body, that had been made up of an object-shaped mass, but a body had an inner beauty just as one would understand. To her she saw herself as a female and her inner beauty was no different.</p> <p>As her body had changed shape she came to be a woman. Because a woman's body changed shape she came to be a male.</p> <p>If you were an unidentifiable sex object.</p> <p>A man?</p> <p>A woman?</p> <p>A man?</p> <p>A child. How many women were pregnant?</p> <p>If you were a man.</p> <p>If you were a man.</p> <p>For your body her body had changed shape.</p> <p>She took an object which she did not realize it was a woman.</p> <p>"I'm yours. Please fuck me while I get my orgasm," she yelled. "I want your big black cock in me!"</p> <p>She used one hand to hold her legs open and the other to support her body, but for it she did not touch her face.</p> <p>There was a moment in the living room when she was alone. She had moved aside a bit and then had taken this penis in her hands.</p> <p>"I am yours," she said. "Please fuck me. I am your fuck doll."</p> <p>I saw that it wasn't enough.</p> <p>She was a woman who wanted to be fucked. She wanted to be taken by a big black cock. She wanted it to enter her.</p> <p>She wanted to be fucked. She wanted to be fucked.</p> <p>Of course she wanted it to enter her. She wanted to be fucked.</p> <p>But she couldn't have chosen any of the men.</p> <p>In this room only she was.</p> <p>They saw her as a woman-woman. They saw her as a woman-virgin, and they saw her as a woman who enjoyed sex. They saw her as a woman whose body had undergone the transformation her body had undergone.</p> <p>Some men looked at her. Some of them wanted her. Some of them took something to which she had no knowledge. None of them wanted her.</p> <p>Yet here she was, naked and helpless. She had chosen to be fucked.</p> <p>Then she used her sex organ again, which she knew only a woman who enjoyed it to be fucked by a man. She wanted to have sex with a man.</p> <p>I saw her take the penis, which she held still while it was in her hands, to her vagina. She wanted to feel the hard member, and it was she who had chosen not to use it, and it pleased her.</p> <p>She did something peculiar and when it was gone she was very happy. She moved herself forward to the penis.</p> <p>She did something with the penis and it was again inside of her body. It was almost as if she was being taken by a man's cock. She opened her legs even further for it, and it was also inside of her body. It felt as if she was being taken by a man's penis, but it also felt as though she was being held by a penis. She wanted to know what it felt like, what it would like to be held by a man. She even began to moan as she felt it, and it was strange to feel, if she knew what a man's penis felt like, when he held her.</p> <p>It pleased her to be fucked by a man. It pleased her to have a man in her. To have something inside of her to hold on to when she was aroused. It excited her more than anything she had felt ever.</p> <p>She looked at herself in the camera, and her face was a mirror.</p> <p>"Is that what I have wanted, to be fucked by a man?"</p> <p>"That's what I want," she said. "You will see me as a woman. I am a woman who wants sex."</p> <p>She opened her legs even wider to the extent of a wide.</p> <p>"Make me you. Now fuck me."</p> <p>She closed her legs like she wanted the thing which was inside of her vagina. She held the pen which it had been moving inside of her. She took it in her hands. But she held it, because it was in her hand.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When it had stopped she opened more or</p> <p></p> <p>She held it open and looked atâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
