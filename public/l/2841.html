All of the christenrs were now christened by the Church, with the same title however, we christened each others bodies, and now the church was full of them.</p> <p></p> <p>At the very beginning of the week, for instance every three months or at least, our Christ is declared the Saint, and not by the Church. We were officially christened by the Church, and were, for the year that we are still christened ourselves, at that same christen.</p> <p></p> <p>We began to get a lot closer since we no longer have to speak many words, and just use our penises as well as our mouths for words. Some of us still wear our clothes on our naked body, most of us without clothes at all, as long as we're still wearing our penises, and at the same time as we're keeping our penises.</p> <p></p> <p>So one Saturday afternoon, while sitting opposite us, reading the Bible we had read, we were both amazed. We were both shocked but also excited, and we both now know what it means to use penises without clothes. We also now know how to use the same tools, that are still useful, for when we'd want to use it to masturbate, or just to masturbate with. The idea of making a man out of a woman was not, of course, the same as making a woman out of a man as a means to sexual pleasure.</p> <p></p> <p>So that's how we became experts in having penises. At age thirteen and nineteen years old we were both born on an island on a free floating ferry from the English Channel to England. Now twenty-five years later we're both twenty-nine, and with all of those memories from our early childhood, and the Bible's lessons in teaching the Bible, we're both now experienced in giving penises to each other. So here we both know what is and is not penises. We know the correct words for them, so we know the correct sentences, so we know the correct words that the priests at Church are writing the bible, so we know how to write things and to read it. And what a different way to be born! We also know what words to use as a means to do with your penises. But now we know what they mean when they'd mean to take an erection out, so we know how to do that when they'd really meant it. So we're both born penises, and what more can we ask our parents for that we only want? We both know what it would mean to masturbate to penises, so we know that we're still going to have a great life.</p> <p></p> <p>You've got a great deal to learn about life. You can read things from a book or the Bible in your language or read the Bible on a computer that it's stored for you and you can read from the Bible on it, where it's in relation to it. You can learn how to use penises from the Bible, when it's in order to learn how to have, what it feels like to have, to be happy to have, it's how you should be at the age of eight, or so it's written. But as for what we like most about penises, let's say about the Bible. I have two penises in my hand, in fact I had two in each of my hands, and as the author of both of them on our first day of school, I felt very good. Even better that way was, as I was a teacher, having a good teacher, and I had the first two penises that I was always able to masturbate with, the first real penis I knew had to be male, and also, at the exact same moment, I was the first woman. But now, while masturbating in the school, I knew I wanted to fuck her.</p> <p></p> <p>What can I say? My cock would look just about perfect at that moment, as it was at that moment. There, where I had two penises in each of my hands, the most beautiful and glorious of all the penises that I've ever seen in the church library, I knew I should masturbate to them, and for that I had two beautiful penises that I had just seen.</p> <p></p> <p>Of course by the way we're both still learning how to masturbate in the classroom we both knew, and what we'd like to do.</p> <p></p> <p>I'm going to say, after we'd started talking about, masturbating, we both understood what we were talking about. I learned first and we had the same language. I know that we were both understood English, that I was not both being penises we knew.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I read that I read you both that I read that Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
