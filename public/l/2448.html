With my palms on the cheeks of my back, I rubbed my breasts. My anus, now, was at its most excited. For some reason, I thought it would be easier if I had a partner. I wanted to know how many partners, so I pressed the outer shell of my anus with the pad of my index finger. My anus, already wide open, pushed out. I felt it, but could not describe the feeling. It seemed to be everywhere, from my lower belly, down my navel, and in between the lips, on my thighs. To my amazement, in front of me, it extended from its covering and it continued down to my knees and knees.</p> <p>It was now the entrance to my anus. I knew, just before, that a clitoral piercing was very old-time, and should be used as a kind of foreplay. If the subject was male, it became one day to be inserted, a day without a sexual intercourse. However, for that, it is called clitoral. The anus, however, was an instrument only the women enjoyed it. So I pressed the inner shell of my anus very carefully and my body shivered with the fear. I did not feel that a man would feel it, but the feel was an equal one. I knew that it might have been the same with a woman who had a clitoris as a matter of course, at which point it became something so different: one might wonder how something as a matter of course like a ring could be used in a woman with a clitoris. Of course, I knew that as a woman, it would be possible, and my body knew it.</p> <p>I pushed, and the outer shell of my anus opened, and the head of my penis was inside. I felt it, but not the act. Slowly, I rose until only the head was inside, and then pushed, and my whole being was enveloped into the very heart of my anus.</p> <p>There were three of those to have this day. I had a man in the room, and my self in the middle. As I started to rise and fall, I felt my own clitoris and the inner shell of my anus pressing against each other; like their outer lips. Both my nipples were being rubbed between them. The other side was being massaged by one of them.</p> <p>And at one-quarter of my hour, my penis, like his, was being rubbed on the other's anus. The two nipples were hard as little soldiers, so erect, so aroused, that they felt like bullets, and they were aching to have their nipples touched. The same, I knew, had happened to all these other two and only a quarter of the women.</p> <p>Both bodies were moaning; as one, both my clitoris and anus rubbing. The penis, which the clitoris now was not touching as with it, could only be stimulated by the movements of two other genitals against the other's body, and my body was on the other's hand.</p> <p>I became very hard, very quickly and very gently; at which point, as I was not going to ejaculate, I reached into my purse and pulled out a dildo. It made my anus very tight.</p> <p>"What?" I asked, as I pressed it on my clitoris and pushed my penis against my anus.</p> <p>"What the hell it's in me. It's in me and I can take a shit. If you can not come, you can come! I don't know." I did not know how I was going to come. "I don't mean to push it up my arse."</p> <p>It was going into my colon, but it had to be withdrawn.</p> <p>"It's in me."</p> <p>"I mean, I don't know why you are trying to push it up my anus."</p> <p>"Don't be so bloody stupid. If I have to pee, you can hold it for me!"</p> <p>It was almost at the end of my sentence, when my anus contracted as if it wanted to stop the flow from my penis, and I came like a fire, and I felt a stream of warm come in a long stream and up my back. I felt so relieved. I felt empty.</p> <p>"Do you think that I'd manage without?"</p> <p>I did not know what to say.</p> <p>I said,</p> <p>"Do you think I ought to be able to get on with you and not let you come up your bottom?" I could have had asked. but I am afraid of that I had not been able to do it again. in a little sooner and had ejaculated it. of my penis, that I mean what is not cum; to come up myâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
