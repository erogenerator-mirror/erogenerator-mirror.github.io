Which places are first, Mat.</strong> Book Three. Chapter Six.</p> <p>"But it is your first time for us to be together" I state, staring into those wonderful eyes of hers. I'm a lucky man to be in the arms of such beauty. And that body that was made to be in mine.</p> <p>She kisses me passionately. As well as the rest of us. Her tongue slides along my lips, I begin to kiss her back, the same tongue play that my sister has taught me. I begin to kiss her shoulder then slide down, nibbling the skin on those soft arms as I begin to knead her breasts.</p> <p>Her skin feels warm and silky as my tongue slides through her soft breasts. I love her breasts. That's why I picked to wear that shirt that day, because the feel was worth it to have them in my hands. But it's not enough this time. Her nipples are harder than a rock and almost reaching my mouth. As much as I love sucking on her nipples, they never really go soft. And her tits don't sag as much as I would like to imagine, but they never do that to her. There is just something about her with those big nipples. The way they get up as I suck on them. Her hand reaches up to fondle my balls as I suck her tits. And then she slips one finger into me. She's wet already and wants me to fuck her while I lick her.</p> <p>I don't have to be in the car. I can kiss her or just take her in my arms as we slowly make our way to the back of the pub. But the driver in the driver's seat and I don't care who he is. They have no idea what we are doing. I take her out of my arms.</p> <p>"Do you like it when I fuck you?" I ask her while looking into her eyes.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she answers with a kiss.</p> <p>Our kisses continue to deepen as I undo her shirt. When I pull it off, she raises one shoulder to let me remove it, then moves down to take my hand and guide it to her breasts. I do that too as she undoes my pants. She pulls them off as I stand up. She can't resist my cock even as our tongues begin to dance the tango. Her lips, tongue slide all around it. I want to watch as she sucks it just for a second.</p> <p>"I think it's time to get our clothes off" she whispers in my ear. I can feel that big hard cock between my legs pressing against her as we look into each other's eyes. I slip a hand under her skirt, teasing her sex with my fingers. We can clearly see the moisture glistening on her as it drops to the floor.</p> <p>"Let's take this to my bed, shall we?" I can't wait any longer.</p> <p>As soon as I'm in bed, she straddles me, her hot wet pussy pressing against my cock. She has only started to grind against me a few minutes before. But the pressure of her body against mine makes me want more as she starts sliding up and down. "Oh god! My god!" I cry out when I enter into her. With her hands behind her on my chest, she begins to buck her hips, grinding back at me. We can't take this anymore as she moans, "Oh god yes! I'm cumming!"</p> <p>With every stroke, she moans louder, "I'm cumming too!" Her whole body quivers and she has to hold me close, "Oh god! I'm cumming!" And her hands go under my shirt, "I'm cumming too!"</p> <p>"I'm so wet!" She cries as she begins to ride me.</p> <p>"I'm right on top." I tell her before I lift up, her legs wrapping around me.</p> <p>"Do it, do it now!" She cries. Our love making is slow and sensual and pure.</p> <p>"Yes!" I roar as I release into her. Our bodies shake together.</p> <p>"Oh fuck yes!" she yells as her fingernails begin to scratch my back.</p> <p>We lay next to each other on her bed, kissing each other before she lifts my shirt out from under me and slowly begins to rub my cock. "I can touch you there!"</p> <p>"I'll be ready soon." I tell her as I go to take a few steps. She grabs my hand, not letting go of my cock, and pulls me on top of her. My shaft slides into her as I slide myself into her, our bodies locked together. Both of our mouths are open and our eyes are open as our faces locked together.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh Jesus. I'm yours." I love you".< are yours<."</p> <p></p> <p>Oh god, I<.< god"Oh yes I<â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
