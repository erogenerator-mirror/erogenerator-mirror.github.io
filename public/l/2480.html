And therefore when there is nothing to</strong> be said, why should anyone be guilty?</p> <p>There is only you to know, you can't be guilty.</p> <p>There is absolutely nothing to be said.</p> <p>There is no need to stop.</p> <p>You're doing it.</p> <p>And it goes on and on.</p> <p>You're fucking.</p> <p>There will be no stopping.</p> <p>The pleasure is undeniable.</p> <p>And the pleasure is that, in so many words, you're a whore, a slut, a whore...</p> <p>Now if you could get away with just the right kind of language, that's enough to describe me. Now what, exactly, is the word for what you're doing in the dim candlelight?</p> <p>It's the word for what you're fucking.</p> <p>It's the word that says, "You're fucked." And when you're doing it, you've been fucking the man for months now...and now you're fucking him...and you're telling him how you've been since this very thing happened. And if you must admit it to yourself, you're having sex with somebody who has never fucked anyone before...</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>But it's something else. It's a word for something else like sex...and when you, the man, are fucking somebody, he doesn't know that he has fucked someone for the last few years, but you know it from hearing him say this.</p> <p>It's the word for doing it in a public place...and when there's no one around for miles, you're fucking him...and when you see people looking at you from the street, as if they just happen to be standing there, waiting for you, they will be watching you now, taking a look, knowing what their eyes see, knowing what it brings to them, and when we're all of us watching you...you're fucking someone from a distance, you're fucking someone from behind...and you're doing it. It's not only the word, or maybe it is the word of a whore, but the word that, once the word is spoken, you'll be fucking someone from behind...and if you're a whore who just can't be fucked, what can you do if you don't really want to be fucked by somebody...or by anyone? I mean, you're just fucking the man from behind, you're just fucking him from behind...but that's only what you are. You're fucking him from behind, it's just fucking him from behind...</p> <p>You're fucking someone from behind.</p> <p>You've been fucking whoever you are, right? You're fucking him from behind...you're fucking him from the front...you're fucking him from the back...</p> <p>Yes, we all know that, I suppose, and yet there is nothing to speak. Not here and now, and I've only been fucking that man for a little while. And yet, because that's what this is, that's really just fucking, you're fucking this man...you're fucking someone from the public place..and you're fucking him by yourself...You're fucking someone from behind, this is the word...</p> <p>It's the word of a whore, isn't it?</p> <p>It's the word of a slut, don't you know it...</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>It's the word of a slut...</p> <p>I'm fucking him now.</p> <p>It really is, is it?</p> <p>Yeah it is. There is something else...and the word is, there may be people watching. It's a word that's been whispered to me, a word that I can only vaguely remember. I don't give a damn what anyone thinks about what they're looking at.</p> <p>I'm fucking him with this cock, and it's not just a word, it's a meaning...a meaning to us that I'm sure you've never tried to explain. A meaning that has become a word. If we go and fuck each other, if I am a whore, I am just fucking him from behind. It's the word of a whore. It's the word of a slut.</p> <p>And, believe me, in these words, do you know what you're doing?</p> <p>Do you know what kind of whore you are?</p> <p>If I can fuck him from behind, you can fuck him from the back, you can fuck him hard, you can fuck him from behind, you can fuck him from the front. Who the fuck do those words mean to you?</p> <p>This is a word. It says, "Fuck it feels good" or in some cases, "It feels right..." and that word says, "Fuck it feels good" or in some cases, "It feels real good feels real good feels real good..."</p> <p>Who you're fucking the whore is fucking the man, is the man from behind you are from behind is you are behind.</p> <p>You have been a whoreâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
