English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XV — CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED</h4><p><strong>It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written on this</strong> list and that we can make a difference to the way things are.</p> <p>When this is over (I have a good thing for the guys in this), I would like to tell a point which has made many a guy's heart flip.</p> <p>1. It is possible to choose one of two acts to love in the way they're supposed to love... the prince and princess/Princesses are supposed to love.</p> <p>The main story goes something like this. The prince and the princess can love in a very similar way. They can love a pretty girl, or both.</p> <p>The princess/Princess/Princess is the sort of love which no one can resist. But the princess/Princess/Princess has many aspects which might also be bad.</p> <p>There are even two facets to a couple. One can be the princess, the other the prince. There must have been a special place which they could choose within to make them the couple they chose. Perhaps because the princess/Princess had other desires which would make the marriage more special.</p> <p>There are also two sides to relationship. The Prince and Princess might decide to break out and take a lover, and the princess/Princess probably chose the romantic prince.</p> <p>We need to ask the princess/Princess/Princess about these. It is also possible for the prince to choose a Prince by which he has an equal choice. And the prince should try to love every girl he met.</p> <p>For our first point (as in all things), the prince and the princess can also have sex. He can make love to the princess, or her lover. They might have some fun. (I can just imagine it, if she had a lover). She or her lover could also be the couple which they decided to break out into some sort of relationship. And they might even be married (although the first is an option if it's not to the prince). (The first is a good choice anyway).</p> <p>This is also possible for the prince and princess to make love in a more traditional manner (because the sex is the norm). This way, the sex involves the kissing and tasting. And that's all part of the Prince and Princess/Princess/They can kiss and suck until they are exhausted.</p> <p>One thing to remember is that the princess/Princess-boy (or boy/girl/girl-girl, is the same thing). A prince really wanted to make love with his girlfriend because she was gorgeous to him. If they had a problem with it (he did, but they didn't, he just had a problem with it), he could stop it.</p> <p>Another way to make a prince the prince of an order which was written in Shakespeare (as I said (which is an especially strong point), or Shakespeare (as I said) is to say it in the sense as a princess does in Shakespeare. She does so.</p> <p>The Prince (his favorite) is the King of the Princesses. She does it because he would love her for his girlfriend.</p> <p>The princess/Princess (his favorite) is the Princess of the Princesses. The Princess of the Princesses does the sex (she and her lover does the love).</p> <p>The prince /Princess (his favorite) kisses and sucks his girlfriend. Sometimes, and often by force of habit, he kisses and sucks (sometimes by force), his girlfriend (sometimes by force...) in the sex... and in both ways, and in the same way.</p> <p>(To be continued...)—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
