Surmises.</h4><p><strong>Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed ready</strong> to blow. Though it was clear, the sight of this man was worth it as he stood and pulled his pants and shorts off to reveal the very hard-on he was sporting. The sight of him had stirred the lust in her too and she needed it so bad. With her hands working their magic behind his back she could tell that he had a very impressive package. It was not too long, though.</p> <p>Still behind this man she had to admire as he stood before her, naked, his large member standing up thick with blood red veins. Once again, she felt a surge of lust race straight to the centre of her being and she couldn't help but run her fingertips over her stomach as she imagined what her hands would feel like on any man. He might be nice, but it would not feel all that good up close, and it would not feel as hard or throbbing as it had in her hands.</p> <p>In fact, he may not be all that good.</p> <p>But he did have some staying power. And what a cock he had.</p> <p>After all, the last thing she wanted and wanted in this life was a cock up her pussy. She could not help but reach down and play with herself, just waiting on his reaction. But she certainly didn't want his reaction right now. It might be a very awkward engagement if he got shy or unsure and did his duty and took her hand on the back of a sofa chair. This was a risk he couldn't take.</p> <p>Instead of letting him see how easily she might be affected she went right to her knees and unbuckled his jeans. She had come prepared and she didn't want to mess things up again. Once the jeans were undone she made sure to remove them also and took his whole length deep into her mouth. She made love to him with her mouth and tongue and hands. Her mouth was wet and the saliva made the soft skin slide between her lips. It made it possible for her to suck him deeper and she made herself a comfortable chair so she could lay back and enjoy his hands as he moved her hair around and caressed her neck.</p> <p>She let the pleasure of it all consume her as his cock penetrated her mouth and she felt the wetness of his pre-cum slide across her tongue. She looked up from his thrusting hips and saw his hands on her head again and she smiled before lowering her eyes and reaching up to grab his shoulders with her hands.</p> <p>Just a moment later with her hands she reached beneath him and he felt the soft wetness of a hot dampness against his skin. The sensation of her lips and tongue against his cock filled him with a desire that no words could adequately convey. She made soft sucking noises and her body started moving against him so that his cock was almost as hard as hers was and with just a touch he found himself going even harder. With a sudden movement he bent down and kissed her on the lips, their mouths opening to share his taste. His hands found their way to her small breasts and he squeezed her nipples before cupping them in between his fingers and lifting her and holding her so she could feel the strength of his cock once again throbbing in her mouth.</p> <p>Her lips parted from his and the head of his cock came out of her mouth, then, and all of it was gone. She smiled, then, and then she let out a long, low moan of pleasure when his prick went back into her mouth and she knew that she wouldn't be able to hold out much longer.</p> <p>Her mind couldn't have stopped what was happening if she had imagined the scene she would have had in her mind. She lay back on the chair she had been kneeling on and her legs parted to allow her to reach her wet fingers into her sex as it eagerly awaited her pleasure. She moaned in anticipation of what was coming.</p> <p>He came in and she felt that thick piece of meat sliding against her lips as his hips moved against her pelvis. And then she felt him explode in her mouth and as she greedily sucked on his cock. It was pure pleasure. She knew her fingers where he would have reached, how he would have touched her if he could make her come, as she looked up at him as he finished off in her mouth.</p> <p>Her heart was beating so fast and fast she could hardly believe her own words as she watched him. It wasn't just the length or the volume of his pulse, it seemed. That thought made her feel dizzy with lust as, without any of this, she couldn't believe the words that were coming out of her mouth as she watched him cum.</p> <p>and see his dick come and fuck and be both of this she realized what they thought. And she was what she had become one and what. Neither was what they were. and what and the and the very the future she both felt. And that.
