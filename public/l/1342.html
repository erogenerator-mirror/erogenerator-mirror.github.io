The Night</h4><p><strong>Monte Cristo waited, according to his usual custom, until Duprez had sung his famous “Suivez-moi!” then he rose and went out. Morrel took leave of him at the door, renewing</strong> her clothes and returning to her place upon her bed. Morrel had not told her she was meant to be a model for her first session of her 'solo”, only that she should keep her bra and panties on. She would not do so in her bedroom. And she was right to know that. What did the phrase with a naked woman mean to you?</p> <p>Mordrel thought about her new experience. It had been fun. She was going to learn how to please her new lover. Her first lesson could be to find out just where to touch him to make him go off again. She was in the mood. Morrel thought in that same moment to find out how to go about her first act of self-soul possession in the morning. She would begin by sucking his cock. That would do. Then she would lick him, or kiss him as he sucked. He would then play with her tits and then do her again. A little pussy eating, and a lot of sucking. She would tell him which position she preferred and he would fuck her. Morrel had seen more porn than she would guess in her entire life and she had never expected to try out for any porn. She decided she would be just a tease.</p> <p>She thought about her first session and what it would be like. She decided that she would love it if Sir Marcie was here, would get in her way to let her do the same. Morrel lay to the middle of her bed and looked at the ceiling as she continued her practice in mind. She was about to be her first model and she was going to enjoy it very much so why should she mind?</p> <p>After a long and intense session of self-soul worshipping she thought about her first session. She had been on a different bed than she intended. Now Morrel was ready to pleasure herself as she knew she loved to lick her lovers cock. She could hear his breathing getting a little heavier than normal. He was on the edge in his chair watching the television and reading all sorts of porn. Merely because he had no interest in reading anything on the other channels. She would enjoy watching him. She decided to wait until he finished reading.</p> <p>Her new toy was his cock and balls and he was a real man. She felt the first tickle as she held his balls in her hand. His balls didn’t need a lot of stimulation there so she felt no pain when she rolled one ball while pinching its skin tight. Merely because he could stay as hard as she wanted him. Her pussy had been so wet and wet. She decided she would have to make him cum before anything else happened. Morrel loved to be treated like a sex slave. When he was ready to cum she would make him cum herself. If she knew it would make him cum and make him cum in her mouth or in her pussy then she would do it as hard as she did in the first session.</p> <p>Morrel thought it over, put a little lube on her tongue and began to lick his balls and her pussy together. His body was beginning to respond to her as she moved her hand to his cock and began to pull him toward it with her mouth. She sucked on his cock as he began to pull her up against his lap. His cock went into her. His mind said fuck. He thrust and thrust, but she was too busy to notice at this point. His cock slid in and out of her wet hole until he felt his balls begin to tighten up and then he would climax. Morrel could feel his cock in her hand, in her mouth, and in her pussy. Cum was shooting down her throat. It was a wonderful sensation. Her mouth was tight around his cock and her hand on his balls. His cock exploded into her mouth and she moaned with the feeling of it.</p> <p>She smiled with satisfaction.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Morrel thought about every time she had watched herself being done to herself and she had orgasmed as much as she had watched herself being licked by her new lover. Her own pussy was so wet it glowed in the darkness of the room, but she still knew there was a man in the room. She didn't know who it was, but she knew she wanted to be there as he had her in the middle of a busy day.</p> <p>"Morrel?"</p> <p>She could hear the soft voice of Richard. She glanced at the clock beside his desk; 6:23. Morrel was not sure if she had left him a message or sent. He must have left her a note at work, she thought to herself. A message to have a good fucking is a very good luck relationship. She smiled to tell him all that I want for him. She got up with a smile.</p> <p>Mordi, I have a good luck feeling like you want a great time I had a great time I need to see—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
