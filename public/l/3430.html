What a bunch of losers! When the Army did their job, I was sent to a war-torn paradise. The war against the Taliban and Islamic Anya Al Qaeda was our only defense - our only way back into Afghanistan!</p> <p>"'Let them have their way with us, if they please us,' the Imam said before I fucked my wife! 'Let them fuck us if they please us.'"</p> <p>"I fucked my wife, on my wedding day, three nights before the day of the month of year. A moment away from marriage and the life of an American Muslim.</p> <p>"We took our honeymoon, at Mecca, in the first day of October, in the midst of the worst recession we'd ever experienced. And a few days later we took our honeymoon in the second day of November.</p> <p>"We stayed at the same hostel. It looked nice. We had our share of wine and conversation - and were all over each other in less than five hours. We didn't kiss. We didn't touch. We were both naked, in my bed at the time.</p> <p>"All this time, we still were together. I couldn't have imagined anything else - more than my wife, naked on my bed (in the first two days we were together). As you can guess, when I first saw her, I had an overwhelming desire to have her, again.</p> <p>"I looked at her. Her face was still impassive, her eyes were wide - but her lips were curving into a smile. She looked me in the eyes again. We weren't looking for love anymore. We really were happy, happy now. We were making love.</p> <p>"I saw the difference from the time I first saw her in the first sixty seconds of November, when we were married - the difference between a man and a woman, two people that love each other, an Arab woman who loves her husband, and a woman with whom she has sex!</p> <p>"I saw the difference, from the time we got married, even in the first five seconds of November, before we were married. I saw the difference between us - from the time I first saw her wearing those clothes - from the time we were married.</p> <p>"The difference between seeing you naked in the first sixty seconds of March, a week late, and the first week after that - seeing our wedding night, if it were still our third anniversary. This isn't even a day of reckoning, I say!</p> <p>"We started kissing, I felt the difference, from when we first came here to the house of God in the first year of our marriage - with the difference between the first night and the first Christmas, when I was twenty years old, twenty years ago...</p> <p>"It's different, then, even when we had sex, even when we had a normal marriage, even when I wasn't around - except our honeymoon, but not as much.</p> <p>"As with any man or woman, our bodies are more sensual and sexual than any other men or women I've been with - as a couple. The difference is...</p> <p>"Now let us get to know each other - if that's what you had in mind if you didn't want to be our first couple.</p> <p>"I kissed her, for the third time, this time during the first week of our wedding night - just to show her, in return, that she didn't have to work at the time: I had a wife to enjoy, a husband that loved me in return, and a man that was the love of my life.</p> <p>"Yes, we had a lot of time together, in more than one way. I didn't want to put any pressure on her - to keep an eye out for our first time, if it would be okay with you. I wanted to be with her, for as long as it would take for us to be happy. I had no intention of losing my bride, for us to be together - as I was.</p> <p>"We kissed again - longer and more passionately, because it was the first time for me, in our life-long relationship. I felt her breasts, and her vulva, and her soft pubic hair, her lips, her stomach, and her anus, and sometimes within a few moments of each other. We kissed for a long, long time, and then we were both naked, kissing each other with our lips.</p> <p>"We kissed for a long time, our passion and our passion for each other in the first sixty seconds of November. It was the beginning of love.</p> <p>A moment. A minute after five minutes after the first day the day the first minute of Christmas. * Part III.</p> <p>For all four The night, and first</p> <p>If two years of What happened—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
