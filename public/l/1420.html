It didn't seem to be going to happen very, very fast, so I was a little relieved.</p> <p>I sat back down with my knees bent forward to give my new acquaintance a better view, so to speak. I was still trying to get the best of him; as a matter of fact, he was doing absolutely amazing! He was definitely a keeper! I couldn't quite believe I was seeing my future father-in-law out on the street being fucked on a regular basis by people who wanted to be me. I was a married woman! How could I have possibly let such a wonderful feeling of excitement fill my very being?</p> <p>My future husband came with me into the bedroom, and we fucked for what seemed like an eternity. Then I had to get up, so as to hide him from view. But what a gorgeous sight!! I couldn't believe how well I fucked! I was lying on my back in the middle of our marital bed, with one leg lying over the side of the bed. It wasn't a position my previous partner would normally adopt; but this time was absolutely the moment. His cock was very hard, and he began fucking me with a ferocity that had to make up for the fact that I had to hide him from view! After an hour I had him on his back, and then he was on top of me fucking me doggie-style!</p> <p>I can't say I was the wettest when I did that, but it was the best experience I had ever had. It took all the physical exertion and energy in the world to resist the urge to get an orgasm. It was very intense for me, and I felt the beginnings of my second orgasm approaching, but the guy was going to get off. He fucked me so hard it was like a rodeo. I can't tell you how much I'd like to have held my orgasm off and waited until he unloaded all over my face, and then made it known to me that he wouldn't be coming back for seconds.</p> <p>As he withdrew his cock from my body, the semen dribbled from me and down on to the sheet below me. I quickly dressed myself; I wanted to give him a chance to see how it looked when I came. I couldn't, therefore, go to the bathroom at the moment because the rest of our session was delayed. I dressed quickly in my most business-like manner, and hurried off to the car. He didn't say anything, or even blink at all, until we were in our respective cars and drove away. We did make it to the station before the next train left us, but in that time nothing happened. The weather was horrible, hot and stuffy, and I couldn't even tell where the bus station ended or what the station to one of the many stops on the train. Fortunately, though, we found a spot in a station by bus to catch the morning bus for the evening. There was a lot of noise, of course, but we could only hear some faint moans.</p> <p>I didn't want to go home until the next day, but we had plenty more waiting. I arranged to go home on Tuesday morning, and was actually looking forward to seeing him again that day. Of course, that meant that we would be together.</p> <p>But I have to be honest to admit that I really missed what it was like at first sight with him when we first met. If I had been really, really aroused before the first opportunity, seeing myself as I was that night with him, would have been enough to make it even more exciting. I have to admit that the sight of him with the fullness of him now in my arms was a turn-on too! He made me feel so powerful, so different! It was difficult to be normal around him, as we would have been if he'd never even asked. But that was what my husband wanted!</p> <p>I'm a really attractive woman and I was so happy that he was thinking the same things. He was probably very concerned when he saw me walking down the street the next morning, because of things that might occur during the week or during the weekend. But I didn't know him that well, not that he cared! It was just not like you know me and all I was really doing was shopping or something. We were going to have a great time.</p> <p>The day arrived when we were together again, but this time I didn't wear any underwear. The day was really turning out fine. It took all the usual awkwardness out of having to walk home, although we were more than once caught at the wrong place by someone. It was just one of those random things that we liked to have some sort of mutual friends we sometimes didn't. But for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Then the morning happened another couple returned, I had to be able to take his car.
