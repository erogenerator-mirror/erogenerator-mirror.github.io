"They saw not one another, neither rose any man from his place for</strong> the night, because they did not give him space to himself; nor did he keep himself in the way for which he has been punished for them."</p> <p>While the term "cocksucker" may be a euphemism by now, it is no longer to be taken lightly. As I read the words, I noticed from the author(s) of the text that the words, "fucking a white woman", were not a euphemism by all means to describe a woman's sex anatomy. I guess that by now we had become used to seeing black cocks inside the vagina and rectum of white women; and we were now accustomed to getting a better feel and taste of them in this fashion, for the first time in decades, when a black man was a good fuck and if he continued to make "a woman", as all of the white women in Egypt call it, well, that too certainly is a black man's domain. To be honest, I found that rather amusing, being that a black man's penis is not a long black cock; but a thick and thick dark black long cock nonetheless, that's a black cock indeed, isn't it?</p> <p>"Fucking a white woman for my queen," read the author (s)</p> <p>"A good whore," was written as well.</p> <p>"A good white fucker," read the author.</p> <p>"A great black faggot," (s)</p> <p>To summarize a black man's sex life, black men are not, in many ways, as attractive as well as well as well as well-hung as many men, like them, is the reason why the white women in the Arabian desert, particularly those in eastern Africa, are becoming increasingly more and more infatuated with black bums. I guess this was written by a book dealer who just happened to be aware of my sexual orientation as well as my interest in white women. That book was one of my favorites.</p> <p></p> <p>"A good faggot," read the author (s)</p> <p>"A great black faggot" wrote a woman to me.</p> <p>"A good slut," wrote the author (s).</p> <p>I didn't know it was possible to be sexually attracted to black men, but I'm sure my own physical orientation didn't help at all. In fact, it was pretty much impossible to change, so much so, that all white women in Egypt were quite fascinated by black cocks. Of course, this didn't mean that every white woman in Egypt, especially a black woman, had a problem finding black men. To be honest, when a black man, white woman, or Arab woman in Egypt was fucking a black man, you would think the women of Egypt would just love a black man. The only trouble was that if it were a woman fucking a black man, it was all over, too, for she was simply fucking, sucking, etc., as black or white men are known to do when it comes to black cocks.</p> <p>I got more than a few curious looks from white or black women, including those from African women, but most of these were, once you got to know the woman, they would take it as an opportunity to see, fondle and lick anything of black or white men, including their penises. This also didn't seem to bother or surprise me. White women on their own had to have a good story to tell if they were interested in black cock, so I decided to take the hint.</p> <p>"A good faggot" read the author. "I'd love to see what a black man could do with a black man's black cock."</p> <p>"A good whore," read the author. "I'd love to see what a black stud could do with such a good fuck. After all, he's a man and I'm a woman."</p> <p>In spite of having just gotten off a few times with black dicks and now fucking black men, it did not take me long after that for me to become turned on by, to me, a black man. At first at the least, I wasn't sure if I should get out, but when I did, of course, it was the last real thing I could think to say to someone like that.</p> <p>"A good faggot," read the author. "I would love to see how a black man could fuck a white woman's cunt with that monster cock of his. Then I'd love to see him shoot a load of black baby making sperm into a white lady's pussy."</p> <p>Again, it did not take me long to find that I couldn't help but be turned on just by hearing these words like that. It did. I really turned me a woman and the whole town on to hear the authors were turned on to have a black manly, too, but not only, men and women. It was the only that we didn't mattered to me and women that weâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
