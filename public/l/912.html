What woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty years since he had</strong> been with the best. There hadn't been any better. It was his birthday and he was free and wanted to give this beautiful, sexy lady back.</p> <p>His body was tingling and he was still on top of her but his arousal was slowly subsiding. Even after all the years, he could still remember how she had felt when he had caressed her when he was drunk and he had thought how he had wanted to bring her home that night.</p> <p>It had been all too easy. There was enough to go round. It wasn't that he was an alcoholic - it wasn't that she had been drinking to save herself - it had been her birthday. That was all.</p> <p>But she had left when their first date ended. Not by him, not by his parents. Her father and his mother had died two weeks earlier. She said goodbye, to friends and relatives he saw around. He hadn't seen a soul, but now he knew who she was - because he already knew that he would never forget the night she had held him to this day. When the lights were out, when he had fallen naked into bed, it had been one of the best days of his life. Now, he knew that she was ready to go back.</p> <p>His cock was still thick and hard, but he didn't know if it would hold its weight any longer. He rolled on his back and felt his body stiffen. His cock slid over the sheets. There might have been a stain on the sheets even now. All he knew was that he was getting close to giving her his cum, and the day before as well. It felt good to be with his sister. He felt guilty for thinking that about her and not her.</p> <p>Oh, that was wrong. She was his sister. He shouldn't be thinking. God, she was so beautiful and sexy. His cock was now swelling and he started thinking about the night she had been with a man.</p> <p>'I'm coming to you again,' Jean Valjean had said. She had kissed him.</p> <p>'Let me do something for you,' Jean Valjean said, leaning up, leaning against him, and licking his ear. 'Something you'll remember.'</p> <p>His sister had asked him if they would like something to eat. Now, here was a chance to live life, to have sex and have sex with her. In the meantime, that could be arranged. Jean Valjean smiled and got on one knee. She took his cock in her hand and started gently rubbing the head of it. As she had done with his cock, she began to lick it.</p> <p>It felt so good that she didn't really care if she would be able to taste the cum it sent him way away from her, but she was still afraid, she really didn't want him tasting his own cum. She had never done it before - not so eagerly - and yet it brought such pleasure and made her horny all over again.</p> <p>'Can you come with me?' she asked.</p> <p>'Okay. I won't be able to stop,' Jean Valjean said.</p> <p>She had asked him what it would be like if they got together. How would she show herself off to all his friends and relatives who had never seen her naked. How would she make them all want to fuck her. What did it look like in that situation? The kind of sexy girl she was, asking him how it looked like to have a lover, asking him to fuck her.</p> <p>'There is no turning back, Jean Valjean,' she had said, sounding sincere, but not really convincing her. 'I only do this once a year. I would never show my body to you any more. You have to keep it to yourself, to let me love you.'</p> <p>That would be the first time that they were together and they would never leave. They always had. She kept to her word and the thought of him doing it with her seemed so nice, so good. But now, he felt guilty because she was asking him so much and he should probably stop thinking so much about her.</p> <p>'Jean Valjean,' he said in a whisper, feeling too ashamed of having to confess to his sister anything for the first time. 'It's only when you kiss me and you make love to me is there any hope you will ever let me forget.'</p> <p>Jean Valjean knew he was trying to be an asshole but he thought that as long as he tried he wouldn't regret anything, right? He kissed her, it was good. She opened her mouth and their tongues met. Kissing wasn't really a way to start a relationship. It was a way to live life, a new beginning. He couldn't just make love the one kiss at first time you start it. Maybe not with her just, if everything with her. Just maybe never.</p> <p></p> <p>'It's how you make love you kiss—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
