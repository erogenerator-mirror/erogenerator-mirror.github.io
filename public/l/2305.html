A couple nights and I spent some time snuggled up next to him and a beer in a bottle.</p> <p>He had a way of keeping me smiling with the beers, and he showed no signs that he ever thought about the fishing thing, but he didn't say no to anything I did. We were lying on the bed and I was on my back with him between my legs, his cock sliding in and out slowly.</p> <p>At first I thought he wanted sex, but he seemed uninterested. After a while he began to pound me as he watched me playing with my boobs, and I realized he was becoming more and more enthusiastic in his fucking. It was only a few moments with him having me do it next to him, but I could see he was getting closer. He could see it with his eyes. He had the perfect body in an urban jungle.</p> <p>He pulled my legs up and began to fuck me harder. He reached an arm around my waist and started to massage my tits, and I enjoyed feeling his fingers on my nipples. The feeling of this close attention to my nipples was incredibly arousing, it made me wet and horny.</p> <p>He knew I loved when I was naked, so we kept this arrangement. Sometimes he could look and sometimes he could not. It got particularly intense when he was standing next to my bed and I could see the front of him. He was wearing shorts and his dick was bouncing in front of him as he pumped me. He looked so good and in a way I never wanted to be.</p> <p>"I am getting closer," I moaned.</p> <p>"Take my cock, baby," he whispered, "I want to see how big you love my cock."</p> <p>It came easy for me, being naked and seeing a man for the first time. It made me feel so vulnerable and sexy. He started to fuck me faster, and I could feel the cum building up in my balls.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum—"</p> <p>"Cum for me!" he yelled, his hand moving from my tit, down over my flat stomach, and all the way across my flat stomach. It was all I could do not to scream when a big spurt of spooge splattered against my stomach and down to my pubic hair. "Gawd, baby—you are so fucking hot!"</p> <p>I could feel his cock swell and then throb inside of me. I looked up at him in amazement, and he was staring at me with love and admiration.</p> <p>"Are you okay with all this, baby?" he asked, still smiling.</p> <p>"More than okay," I said, my head resting on his shoulder. Then I closed my eyes and kissed his neck. "I want you to stay the fuck tonight."</p> <p>"But...," he began.</p> <p>"I love you, baby. I've loved you too much to ruin a good thing."</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked into his beautiful brown eyes.</p> <p>"Just so long as it makes you happy"</p> <p>His hand was still on my tummy. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, baby, right now I really want to stay the fuck tonight. I want you to sleep with me tonight."</p> <p>"That's right. I really want you to stay the fuck tonight!"</p> <p>"I love the way you feel and this is making me happy." I put my head on his shoulder.</p> <p>"You know, it's really easy to get away with what you do," he said. "It's just different. We just talk and fuck and get excited. You and me. It's hard. The only way I could ever have to get away with something is to lose the key."</p> <p>"Let the key be a big part of the deal," I said, and I felt he was right. I was the key.</p> <p>"Come on, sweetheart," he said, and he ran his hand down my chest and stomach. "The key is your own personal key."</p> <p>I didn't think much about it at the time, and after I'd taken him into my arms he was already pulling up my T-shirt. He lifted me onto the bed and then climbed back on top of me. He started kissing me while he fingered my nipples and slowly pulled down my shorts.</p> <p>I felt his hand between my legs and it brushed my pussy hair a little more. My panties were soaked.</p> <p>"If you keep doing that I'm going to cum," I said.</p> <p>He smiled. "You're a little kinky," I said. "Are you sure you want this, babe?"</p> <p>"I want this," he said. I wanted, but it's hard to be harder this, but I want to make this hard, you see you have to be really really hard."</p> <p></p> <p>"I love you, love it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
