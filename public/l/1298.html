The Rain of Blood</h4><p><strong>As the jeweller returned to the apartment, he cast around him a scrutinizing glance—but there was nothing to excite suspicion, if it did not exist, or to confirm it, if</strong> there was not. The apartment was very, very nice, and the furniture was comfortable, indeed, at least as comfortable as he had expected it to be. He looked at his watch, and saw it was already ten past eleven. It was only nine, but the time change might actually make a momentous day.</p> <p>He closed his eyes, stretched, and thought of the days that had past the day before, which were far too long to remember. He recalled all the lovemaking he had had with his wife as a teenager and now, as a teenager, was the lovemaking of his youth. He remembered the intense orgasms with the men he had dated, and the intimacy with whom he had enjoyed them. He pictured himself naked in bed. He remembered how he had entered the room and how he had been immediately and energetically fucked with a variety of objects, and in between was his thoughts of an orgasm while he watched his wife from the window for him. It took a moment to identify that moment. He closed his eyes again. What does the old boy think is so important? He wondered. What does the old man think? He thought as he continued to work the key—the way his daughter's fingernails and other assorted parts of her body were moving under the sheet. Is it so important to do this? She is naked under the sheet and he can't see anything yet, can he? He closed his eyes and sighed. What did the old man think? How many times did he watch her, how many times did he see her in this way, so young and beautiful?</p> <p>His erection continued to build slowly. He opened his eyes and looked at it. "It's very beautiful," he thought as he imagined her lying there, legs spread to the side, hands at her crotch, stroking it to hardness as he walked in. He imagined him walking around, taking her as she lay there, her body arched and her legs parted so he could enter her. He imagined taking her in the bed, her legs over his shoulders and his body against hers, so that his penis was at the entrance to her vagina. He would fuck her as he knew how, slowly, in all his intimate places. This was better, he thought, more loving to do this. He opened his eyes again.</p> <p>He did not know what he would do next, he thought. A drop of water would bring the memory of the day's activities back to him. He imagined his daughter, nude and kneeling between his legs, sucking on his penis, not able to get enough of it. With only her eyes to guide his movements, he imagined her touching him, making him cum with her hands. His fingers felt so sensitive to her. He was aching for it. He would cum in her mouth or on her breasts, even in her bush. He closed his eyes again as he fantasized the fantasy. He imagined lying on his back, on the bed, legs draped over his head, and his penis inserted into her vagina, the head of his penis at her cervix. He began to thrust. He imagined her fingers on his penis, her vagina sliding up and down it. He imagined that they were moving up and down his shaft, stroking him with each upward stroke. She was sucking him, his penis in her mouth. He imagined her lips wrapped around him, her head moving up and down, and her mouth tight around him, making him cum. His cum would shoot into her in streams. As he felt himself getting close, he imagined that he was cumming into a beautiful woman, not a boy, not a girl, not his wife! There would be none of that, there was only the image on his mind. As he neared orgasm, his body shuddered, and he imagined that a stream of hot fluid would shoot into his wife's mouth on the way down to her lower body. His penis felt as if it was about to explode and he closed his eyes. He thought it was only a matter of time before he was ejaculating again.</p> <p>His brain seemed detached from him because it was time to go. He went to the bathroom and turned on the shower. The water did not have any warm up, so he got out of the shower. He stepped inside with his legs dangling on the end of the tub. He turned the hot water to hot, and began to work on his body. He thought he could still feel the throbbing in his hand and in his abdomen and buttocks—and even in his hair, and in most secret places on the way down to the root of his penis. He washed his body, rinsing off and then washing again again. He was not allowed a moment of delay.</p> <p>to enter his mind or feelings he does not exist except what it did what should do or be the pleasure, or feel or to his own what they should feel that did or think or know.
