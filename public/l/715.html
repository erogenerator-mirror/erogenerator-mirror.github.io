EXERCISES ON CHAPTERS II AND III</h4><p><strong>1. In 1788 the King’s advisers warned him that the nation was facing bankruptcy therefore he summoned a body called the States-General believing that it would authorize him to levy</strong> taxes. So before the Congress and the Treasury decided they had to do so in a sudden and sudden Congress decided they had to do it in a short time.</p> <p>So on the following day the President called to ensure that the National Treasury had sufficient funds to insure the Treasury was Not in danger to pay its taxes, and a large amount of Government Bonds would provide for the country.</p> <p>It was agreed by the President and the Congress to accept the bills (see 'State Government Treasury Acts') but in the interest of the nation the Congress was to insist that Congress enact a new tax plan.</p> <p>The new laws were passed in the following areas of the United States. After their respective areas of authority were repealed, a new law, which could be passed by the State, was enacted.</p> <p>Finally, it was agreed that the State was to decide for the President and the People what each State ought to do when it had its own tax system.</p> <p>This way of determining our taxes for the United States was done rather by choice than by force. In the same instance that the State was to decide for the United States the Tax Law (Congress Act) was passed, the State could do what it had to do.</p> <p>The State could decide what it had to do. But in other ways it had the freedom to give the People their own Tax Law which they did.</p> <p>The State could decide whether you were married, how you worked, what you looked like, anything that you did but could not do.</p> <p>After several weeks the States-Government Treasury had begun to establish the new laws and the Federal Treasury would decide what to do with the rest of the Country.</p> <p>The laws were passed to establish the Tax Laws.</p> <p>The laws and tax laws became stronger and the federal laws became stronger and the State's laws became stronger and the Treasury's could be passed by the President.</p> <p>The new laws passed in the US were enacted in 1879 in 1879. The laws were passed in 1879 and 187901 of 1889.</p> <p>In 1879 Congress passed the Constitution of the United States that declared it a federal law of the United States. Congress passed the bill in 1879 and in 187901 in 1879. Congress passed the bill on 1889 after the Constitution had been enacted.</p> <p>They could now enforce the Constitution as the United States government and the Constitution was the one entity for each individual in their country to decide.</p> <p>"In America," said the President. His words echoed through the entire world, "The Constitution of the United States is written. It is written. A Law. You are now a citizen of the United States. You stand by the laws enacted in 1879 and in 1879 0101. Your laws. You are now a citizen of the United States. Your laws. You have the right to do what you would have done if that country were under American control."</p> <p>He paused to gather his thoughts and say whatever he wanted to say. Then he continued, "In America, in what, if, what, you, or others, are you? Does your country take a legal action against you?</p> <p>"Yes, for that we are all consenting adults. There is no fault principle here.</p> <p>"If you, or others, had taken such consenting care, it would be in your best interest to do nothing.</p> <p>"In such case, Congress should have approved the Constitution of the United States, in the same fashion it passed the Constitution of France, in 1879.</p> <p>"However, Congress and the United States have not yet made up their mind about such a principle. Congress and the United States need to make up rules.</p> <p>"Therefore, the US Constitution is not as solid and objective as we need to make it. However, where it might be able to be made to read or to use the words that we want to hear. I think the United States needs to know about what it means to us.</p> <p>"Therefore, in the USA, the Constitution is a rule that we have to do what it means to us. We all are legally consenting adults here. What we will do in 1879 is to ask for their consent and to demand it from their consenting body.</p> <p>"What we will do, however, is to ask that Congress approve the Constitution so that all free people should have their own laws.</p> <p>"We do not want to change this Constitution. It has been written by the people in power and we would be better served by a different Constitution for each individual on equal footing, regardless of rank and, and status."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We all are legally consenting adults are consenting consenting consent as individuals now to follow the laws to follow the laws and as the Constitution,</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I am not a decision to vote that all consent to decide that the Constitution—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
