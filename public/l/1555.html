English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER VII</h4><p><strong>The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost his head and nearly</strong> fell off the bed he had been dreaming of when he had been in love with his boss and she had fallen off the bed that first night.</p> <p>So, before you knew it, they had begun to fuck before he had met her. Then they discovered one another's interests with benefits. Then things became more than a couple. Then their love began to take over.</p> <p>The girl of his dreams didn't notice that he was standing in front of her, naked, with nothing but himself. She didn't stare at him. But, somewhere deep within her subconscious, she felt that maybe she was watching him fuck. There was this desire there, this intense connection.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, he was moving on top of her, moving into position. With one hand, he opened the buttons of his shirt, and with his other, he pushed the blouse off his torso. Then he put his weight on her, kissing her, grinding his weight into her. Her hands were on his back, holding him close to her. Her mouth parted as her breasts flattened against his. When his hands started to roam, she broke free.</p> <p>"Let's go inside," she murmured.</p> <p>"Okay," he replied, pulling the rest of his clothes off. Then he lay on his back and pulled her over him. She lay over him, her bare flesh pressed against him. He held her close, his hands wandering along her body. She was so warm, so smooth. He let his lips touch hers. They were so warm. The kiss lasted more than a minute as he savored the sensation of his lips against hers.</p> <p>He lay back and watched her breasts rise and fall as she moved, moving in time with his words. He slid his fingers through her hair as she moved against him. He felt the warmth of her body as she moved against him. His penis rose and became aroused. It was so sensitive and hard under her body. He reached to her, grabbed hold of her hips, lifted her, then pushed her down over him and let his penis enter her. The way she felt, it felt so good he lifted her hips so he could sit up. He let her lift and let her lay on top of him. She was so warm. She sighed as he let his mouth fall to her breasts again.</p> <p>With a groan, he thrust into her, and she gasped as he slid into her. Their bodies were joined at the pelvis. It was like they were one being. He was thrusting, thrusting into her. The sensation of her warm body and of him in her was incredible. Finally, he collapsed onto her.</p> <p>The first movement made her lift herself, then fall over him once more. "Come in me," she whispered in his ear.</p> <p>Then he was in her again. He could feel her wetness against his penis. And the way it felt inside her. They were so intimate. Each second was a moment shared more intimately. It felt like a new experience. It felt like they had lived together in her fantasy world for some time.</p> <p>This was the dream Raskolnikov had had so many times with her. This was the same moment he had been dreaming of for years. And, this was his dream too, this time was different, this time was better. She could feel his excitement, his hardness. And she didn't know how to tell him, couldn't tell him.</p> <p>But then an instant later she was moving again. Her eyes were closed and she was moaning into his ear as she kissed him. She loved him. She never wanted to leave him. Now she was moving so passionately. He opened his mouth to kiss her too, then he was back inside her and they were moving faster again, more deeply.</p> <p>They kissed. The sounds of their moans filled her ears.</p> <p>"Yes, yes," she whispered. "Yes, yes. Yes."</p> <p>They were going faster, faster as they had come. Their bodies moved against each other. It felt as if they were in a dream. It was as if they had fallen in love. They were sharing.</p> <p>This time, it was a dream. A long time ago, it was a dream, or maybe a nightmare. But, the passion had grown and the time had come, and she had taken his penis inside of her and kissed him with the force of an animal before she had finished themâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
