Short days, less work. Winter: no warmth, no light, no noonday, the evening</strong> and the early morning came on the way. Winter: summer would finally catch up with them. Summer's just around the corner. Fall's just around the corner. Summer was over. Summer would finally come. Summer's just around the corner. Summer's just about to.</p> <p>That thought made me smile and I walked towards her. I held her and took her hand walked her to the nearest couch. I sat down beside her. We laid there for awhile, just cuddling on the couch. I kissed her eyelids, and slowly my hand moved up her chest. It circled her breasts and then cupped them, my fingers pinching her nipples through the cotton material of her bra. She leaned her head up, her eyes closed.</p> <p>After a while of slowly stroking and rolling her nipples between my fingers she turned slightly around my neck. I had to keep my hand on her breast, I didn't want her to feel that. Our lips met, soft, sweet soft, we kissed, I teased her. I rolled her nipple between my fingers.</p> <p>Without opening her eyes she looked in my eyes. I slowly moved my lower fingers slowly towards her sex. Slowly. Then, just gently, just barely. Slowly I moved to the side of the couch. She sat facing me, her eyes closed.</p> <p>It didn't take long. Without hesitation she unbuttoned, unzipped, unzipped her pants. I slid my fingers inside her undergarment.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh, that feels so good!" she exclaimed. "Let me just sit for a bit," as she stood up. I turned her around, stood up, and stood her up. I placed her hands on her breasts, my hands gently caressing them. Then I took one of her nipples in my fingers and gently rubbed it. She moaned, but I didn't stop the movements she wanted to. I continued rubbing her nipple until she was ready to cum. And she came.</p> <p>I stood up while looking into her eyes, watching her cum. She sat there with her hands on her chest trying to catch her breath, her breaths fast. I had one hand massaging her breasts while my other hand held open her pants, sliding them down her legs to the ground. Without a word she lay there, eyes closed, and I kissed her once. She parted her lips and a drop of her white spit landed there. I continued kissing her while rubbing her nipples, she came again before I had taken off my pants.</p> <p>"Don't stop." she softly said, while trying to catch her breath. I continued to rub her nipples while slowly, lazily she began to kiss and lick my dick again, getting it moist with her saliva. She opened her mouth and slowly began sucking. Her tongue caressed my tip, she sucked on the head. I continued fingering her nipples while she sucked my dick. Finally I sat back and she sat up.</p> <p>We both stood up. She undid her pants and slowly she undid her blouse, revealing her lace top, bra, and panties. As her bra fell to the ground she stood up standing before me, naked. I took in that body, the curves of her body. The curve of her left breast, where her stomach met her lower body. The curve of her ass. The curve of her pussy.</p> <p>"I want you to undress me." she whispered to me. That meant she wanted me. I took off my shirt, and she removed my shoes. She unhooked her bra while rubbing herself while she turned me around to sit on the couch, then began rubbing her body. She slid my panties off then slid down to my feet while rubbing and fingering herself. I was in heaven. I let myself be seduced by her skillful fingers and my wet mouth. She reached a hand under my panties and started stroking. She pulled my underwear off and I stood up while she rubbed my pussy. We lay on the couch, my hands exploring her. She moved her body down and spread her legs, I entered her once again.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me." she said as she started moaning. "Put me down, I want to lie on the floor." She positioned herself between my legs, spread them open, and slowly sank onto my cock. "Ohhh, feels good," she said while moving up and down, slowly. I reached down and opened her pussy even a bit. I spread those lips with two fingers while I fingered her. The more I played with her the smaller she got, the more she moans to the more she wanted. She sat up and moaned more my dick went on my dick. I touched herself all the pussy as welled her pussy.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We lay there. I stood. The smell was no hands everywhere. fingered her body she sat there.
