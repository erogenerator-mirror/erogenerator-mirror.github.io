Seats were brought in</strong> by a catering staff, so the four of them settled down in the comfortable living room, drinking their tea together.</p> <p>"So, what do you want to do tonight?"</p> <p>"Well, we have some more family to do, so we can't do anything else right now," said Anna, "so we'll be going to the park. It's a nice night, though, so we could go out. Then what about you?" said Andrew.</p> <p>"Hmm, I wonder what happens if we fuck?" responded Anna. Andrew wasn't about to admit that he wasn't about to be fucked, so he decided to be daring and ask the question. He knew that it would be a big mistake, which he still wasn't sure he could do. "Are we going to do that?"</p> <p>They all looked at each other. Anna, not understanding who she was supposed to be, couldn't see the difference. Anna was the one who had to have sex, and it was time for her to be the one to have sex. She didn't have to, so she decided to go ahead and fuck. "Yes."</p> <p>Anna leaned over. She got her lips around his left ear, and bit it gently as she kissed his neck. "Well, I've been waiting to for a long time," she muttered.</p> <p>Andrew let out a little laugh. "We should probably just go back to sleep," he agreed. Anna nodded her agreement with a grin.</p> <p>After taking the last sip of tea, they got up, walked toward the bedroom, and Anna took a few steps to get behind Andrew. She could feel the bulge in his pants as she pressed her body against his back. "It'd be so naughty," Anna whispered, "watching that little thing we have..." Anna trailed off to get off the bed and walk in the direction of the bedroom door. It might be easier to get off, but she didn't care too.</p> <p>When they arrived, they had already laid on the bed before, but it was hard to lay on the edge of the bed. Anna crawled on top of Andrew, pressing hard against him as she kissed him for the first time. It was going to be a beautiful night, she realized, as she felt his cock pushing against her through his pants.</p> <p>"This is nice," Anna said. Her tongue slid across his lips, as she felt him respond by running his finger between her upper and lower teeth, which made Anna want to push harder against him.</p> <p>But she was careful, and pulled away from him just enough to say "Let's just get naked and just watch a movie." With that, Anna stripped off her bathing outfit, revealing herself to all. While she'd been nervous about wearing her bathing suit, she had no complaints. Her large, brown-eyes looked so sexy as she looked at Andrew appreciatively.</p> <p>By the time they had got naked, she was already on the bed. She laid naked beside him, pressing her full breasts against his chest and licking his lips. She had a quick thought as to where she wanted to go next, and rolled to her side. Andrew moved over to Anna, who sat up on his lap, pressing their bodies together.</p> <p>They exchanged a glance between each other, but Anna didn't seem nervous. She was already moving between them, and when she felt the tip of his cock against her pussy lips, it sent her into another level of excitement. Anna slowly leaned forward and sucked on the tip of his cock, before plunging it inside her. Anna's mouth felt incredible, and as she began to move her hips against Andrew's, she couldn't help but feel excited at the thought that they were about to fuck. She slid her hand up towards her mouth, which she hadn't gotten to much lately, and began to rub her clit for good measure. As her orgasm hit, Andrew responded with another erection that she had never felt before.</p> <p>Anna's body felt like it was wrapped around his cock, but she was not surprised if she was just wet enough to feel his cock moving in and out of her. She continued with the hand she was now caressing herself, her orgasm continuing to build through her body. When it passed, Anna put her left hand on his hip, the one that she was still rubbing, keeping them joined, and began to work her clit in small circles, making it even better. By the time her orgasm had gone off, she was lying with Andrew on her back, rubbing her clit just as a man would. Anna couldn't help it, and so she began to moan uncontrollably. Her right hand was busy at her crotch, making some circles as she would try to thrust her clit, and just slightly in an inch or something, rubbing herself.</p> <p></p> <p>When she suddenly she felt the tip of Andrew's cock hit her clench her clit, she knew it was inside her, but onlyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
