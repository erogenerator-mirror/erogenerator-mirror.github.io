Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite. There is, as we know,</strong> the universe outside its dark windows - heaven or hell. I do not know how to say that as it is, but if you must, so be it.</p> <p>I was in the mood to do a little fucking for a change. I was, however, only thinking about my own fucking. Well, it didn't really matter to that old man in the mirror. Instead, I'd be sitting in my bed naked and hard from the waist down, waiting for my cock to penetrate me.</p> <p>It was a dream come true for me, even if only from my very first fuck and the one I was about to have with my own cock. I was looking at my own reflection, thinking about what I looked like. I didn't have to get out of bed that morning; I could have gone to work. I had an entire day of fucking at my house and I was going to take a shower and watch a movie before going to sleep. I was going to go shopping, and I was going to shower, and then I'd go home to my shower. I was going to shower and get into some very nice clothes, and then I was going to sit under a hot bath, watching cartoons, and then I was going to sleep.</p> <p>I was, however, going to wake up to a glorious morning. I should have guessed it at that moment. I don't think I slept. I just woke up as quickly as I had and then I was going to shower, and then I was going to go to my shower. I don't know if I could do anything right without it.</p> <p>Of all my fuck sessions, the one I preferred the most? Maybe the most was just sitting up in bed waiting for you, while lying naked next to me. This time, it was my turn lying next to you on the bed. It is very special from a guy's point of view, of course. There is no better feeling.</p> <p>The guy was right. I was going to sit next to you on the bed. What do you expect when you get up just sitting on the edge of a bed just for me? I don't think you know. I don't remember. Perhaps you do, but only that. I could have fucked you right then and there.</p> <p>I got up and went to my bed.</p> <p>The next day, I took my shower and put on some nice clothes that I thought were appropriate for the evening. I shaved my legs, then put on my bathrobe and made a show of going to the liquor store to get some whiskey. When I saw myself in the mirror, you could almost feel how wet I was and how much it meant to you that I was wearing nothing.</p> <p>After dinner and some more of the Scotch and other things, I was ready for another evening of fucking. It was almost 11:00 when a woman approached me. "Are you really staying with the woman who's going to be next door?"</p> <p>"Not a very good sign," I said. "The one who is coming back with her friend."</p> <p>"I thought I got her?" She smiled and nodded.</p> <p>"She's just one of those people. How did you and she get together?" I asked.</p> <p>"That is a story for another time."</p> <p>We went into the bedroom without a word. I took my bathrobe and put it on. We both had the same thing going on: we just didn't get up together the next day. We didn't have the day to talk about it. We just finished our drink, left the house and I went back for my Scotch. We went into her home and then into hers. We didn't leave a minute later. What a fucking night. We went into the bedroom and lay down together on the bed. It wasn't an uncomfortable situation. We weren't in a relationship or anything. She had her arms around me and we were kissing passionately. I rolled on top of her, took her nipple gently between my lips and started to bite it.</p> <p>I moved across her torso and kissed down her neck to just below her nipple. She reached down and ran her hands through my hair so that I had her nipple again. I slid down so that my face was on hers. She parted her legs to give me access to her pussy. I kissed her clit, first lightly, then more deeply. By the time I slid down her pussy, she had her hand in my hair and pulling gently. Our groins were touching each other. She reached down to my cock and caresses it.</p> <p>I slide on bottom of her and I felt her wetness against my cock. She rolled over the head. I did.</p> <p></p> <p>I moved on top. Her. "You're. I feel you are so go, and it is her. "I feel</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
