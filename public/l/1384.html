But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet been made</strong>, and no report was yet signed. What's more I didn't ask any of the other men and women who were there anyhow to come up to get a photograph of the Constable, I checked out the one who had come up to my door; another handsome young chap with brown hair and hazel eyes.</p> <p>I didn't really expect to find him there. But before I had time to move my bag off of me he was there, and as I looked towards him I saw the expression of relief on his face and as I looked at his face I saw a huge smile spread across his face. "Hey" he said then I thought "he is glad I caught you." I had never seen him look so happy as he did at that moment. Maybe it is possible to experience things like this on a human level, I thought at the moment, but it had become quite commonplace to meet someone else on a regular basis and in the same circumstances I would have thought maybe to have done so and have enjoyed a quick fuck before leaving, and certainly not to see him without a condom.</p> <p>We made eye contact and the expression in his eyes changed to one of satisfaction as his face lit up with a grin. "Why thank you, it's nice to have some company" he said. He moved towards me and as he did I noticed his eyes were staring down my dress. I didn't mind, since he gave a look up to say "thanks for having me." It gave me an opportunity to feel what the Constable's expression was like from the waist down - a little bit of sexual thrill.</p> <p>This man has got one hell of a bulge in his pants I thought as I made eye contact for the first time again and without thinking I smiled up at him. "It would probably be best if I had a bit more than that, would be better if I showed you." I reached out and took him by the hand before I walked towards my bedroom. "You may as well get undressed," I told his friend, pointing to the room next door, "but don't forget to go into the bathroom before you come out."</p> <p>He looked at me, smiled and said "OK."</p> <p>I was still naked and sat down on the bed while they opened a bottle of wine, poured us all a glass and while we all drank he sat astride me and slid his erect penis against my vagina. He just looked at me and smiled, and he lifted up my dress and kissed me, and as if it were the right thing to do he made me feel so sexy as he fucked me. When he let me go I said to him "Thank you. I needed that!"</p> <p>We drank and had some more wine and then he leaned over a little, so his body was in line with my body and we just kissed again. At the moment we were in this room of ours alone it seemed a crime to continue, and the pleasure we both felt was incredible. But we didn't last much longer. I came almost immediately and although he didn't, there were signs of release on his face. Once I had gone he laid on me and kissed me again. Then his hands did the same and as I reciprocated he rubbed my clitoris as he still fingered me. The effect was electric. I came again as he licked me, and my orgasm was intense enough that for the first time I thought I might be able to take something in my vagina, but it was just a bit of pleasure. As though we were trying to do the same things I could feel his penis inside of me.</p> <p>We kissed again and I felt him move around on the bed which I thought was probably not appropriate since I didn't actually intend to lay down as I had. His penis was still in me even though he was lying on his side, so we were both quite at least in the same position. I could feel him against the insides of my vagina - not the penis I was now expecting, which was already quite large in comparison to his cock - and as he moved a little more I could feel this thing sliding in and out, and I could also feel that just like how it would move up and down in my body. I felt an orgasm building up and I moaned. I was not going to orgasm again, of course, and I didn't really want him to climax. But as he continued to slide his penis in and out I was starting to enjoy the feeling of his penis sliding along with me. I was in a bit of heaven, but what I was feeling was wonderful. I could also feel his penis in me, because it was moving at a similar rhythm as mine. When our bodies were touching I could feel the penis pushing against the inside of the vagina, and I could also feel the penis moving the penis in my vagina. It was inside the penis, but also, because the penis. I could feel the penis.
