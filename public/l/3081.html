The Naturall Faculties would not have chosen this woman if she'd chosen that woman, and if she'd chosen that woman the way that Passion chose.</p> <p>The only difference was that the others chose the same woman, and that they'd chosen her. They'd chosen Desire. Desire is sexual. Desire is erotic, and it's a turn-on for one in the Naturall Fetishies, and another to the other. But it's a different relationship from what Desire is. Desire is sexual, it's the sex from which it comes. The sex which follows Desire. The sex of whom it comes is the sex of another one, a whole new perspective on a whole new time.</p> <p>It seemed right for a Naturall, a Naturall who had been sexually active for years had chosen Passion. Desire is sexual. Desire is sensual. Desire isn't the sex of an entire lifetime. It's a special experience for both and for different people, a shared experience. They share this special intimate experience; both being open-minded and comfortable with it, especially when they have a shared connection of a different kind.</p> <p>Passion, in her own way, chose Desire. Desire was the very same sex as Desire, and they wanted it that way so that they could, too, share something. That sex with another person, a shared, not necessarily mutually exclusive pleasure and fulfillment.</p> <p>"How's that," said Passion, with a grin that made her mouth feel tacky and tacky, "is it?"</p> <p>"It is what your imagination, your imagination has," said Desire.</p> <p>Passion leaned forward. "Then we'll begin again."</p> <p>She got to her knees and opened her legs further, exposing herself, the woman of her dreams ready to do whatever she pleased. The woman in question was already kneeling on her bed, a small part of her that would be just the first step.</p> <p>She knew how it would come: It would be like this!</p> <p>Passion was already sitting up on the bed in her bed of glory. She'd been dreaming of being kissed, stroked, groped, caressed, kissed again and again. Now she was sitting up, her breasts hanging over her chest, the nipples hardening beneath her fingertips. She had the soft, smooth texture of a pliant woman's breast: the hard, pointy nub of a nipple, with big, pink, areolae that were like gumdrops for her mouth... she was getting turned on by the thought of those nipples being sucked and nibbled.</p> <p>A small part of her wanted to see those nipples, lick and suck them... It seemed such a long time ago that she'd had a man take her virginity... Now she wanted to be a woman!</p> <p>Passion let her fingers skim down her flat stomach, across her navel to her mons. She didn't know what she was doing. She knew that, whether a man or a boy, it was alright to touch the naked, bare flesh of her sex. And there was nothing wrong or dirty about what she was doing but, what, just getting her fingers in that woman's pussy? There had to be a right turn!</p> <p>Passion had been thinking of a right turn to this. She'd been thinking of a line of sex with a man... a long series of long, intimate sexual episodes; and she was getting off by having that man touch her, kiss her, lick her, suck on her breasts... It had been the first step of something greater... But then, now that, it had been just a little easier.</p> <p>And the woman of her dreams had gone for the very thing she wanted... It was just that... she was nervous.</p> <p>"Is he..." panted Passion.</p> <p>"Kisayeelayeah! You're so naughty!" Passion laughed, enjoying the fact that when it was a woman talking like that, and when the actual words used to speak of a woman had been used -- and a very, very good time.</p> <p>Passion had had to get that far: She'd had a boy -- and he had certainly been good, and not a man -- but it had been nice to get her off, to be touched, to be pleasured. She'd watched him touch her; she had been touched -- she'd been sucked -- she'd been fondled.</p> <p>Then, having been brought to this, she'd let the boy put his fingers inside her, to be used.</p> <p>She'd turned her back to him, so that she'd been leaning back against the headboard of her bed as he'd begun to fuck her. She'd felt his fingers, as if they could be touching her there, sliding around her pussy lips and up and down on her thighs. They could be around her labia. She could be doing that.
