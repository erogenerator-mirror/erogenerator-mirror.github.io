Though it was in France but not in the UK, I had been abroad in an extended family. Joe, Biddy and I, I had been together for several years before Joe left me to go back to the States of East Africa.</p> <p>We had come to the capital of Amsterdam together, not as a married couple but as a couple as in the beginning of my tour as a country student. That had not been a surprise as Biddy had just become my personal assistant and for the next several days, there was nothing but peace, quiet and rest.</p> <p>This year, as I approached the first opportunity to visit the capital I had not the slightest doubts that there would be a great deal more of that to come. Biddy and I had a lovely evening of good food and wine together as I would always remember those few hours when I got home with Biddy. I had no doubt she knew, even in her dreary youth, that I would like to return home, when I did not.</p> <p>On the second night I stopped at the Hotel du Boudre for dinner and found Biddy sitting with the headmistress who was not her usual student-wife, sitting with a group of friends. After we had eaten with wine and cigars, we returned to our room while the party was at its zenith. As a result, as we stripped, Biddy invited me to join her and her friends in bed. I was more than willing to do so, however. She and my friends seemed to be in a good mood, however, and while the other foursome was in the midst of a particularly vigorous session of lesbian lovemaking they could not make me remove the gown which left me naked in front of the other four.</p> <p>When I was naked and she was partially clad, she invited me to climb up atop her as she spread her thighs and said, "Hurry, lover", to Biddy who had taken me out of the room and had been watching us intently while Biddy was fucking me.</p> <p>"You are doing very well," I heard Biddy say to her friend, as I entered her. She nodded her head enthusiastically and said, "Good. Now, you two, get me up here on the bed."</p> <p>Before I could get up and move to her as she urged me to her, her friend was between my legs, gently kissing and licking me while Biddy began sucking on my cock, which to this time my cock was in Biddy's mouth and, as she licked me, began sucking me off in much the same way Biddy had done for her, then moving up toward Biddy's mouth and then Biddy's lips before she could get up to my cock, which was about to enter her mouth again.</p> <p>Biddy stood and got into position at the head of the bed with her ass towards me, inviting me to enter her pussy and start fucking her pussy with the full length of me and giving her a long, slow, deep kiss while I did so. I began to fuck Biddy, moving in and out slowly with a slow, long stroke, causing Biddy to moan as I reached out to fondle as many of Biddy's beautiful breasts as possible, and even reaching up to fondle and pinch them as much as I could. Once I was fully erect, Biddy moved over Biddy's hip so that I could have a little more room, while Biddy put my cock into Biddy's warm, wet pussy and began slowly rising and falling on my shaft, allowing me to fuck Biddy's pussy with long strokes until she seemed to be almost over the edge with her own climax. Then Biddy began to move her body up and down, up and down, as my cock slowly drove itself deeper into her womb.</p> <p>Biddy moaned in pleasure around my cock. "Oh, God, Steve, that's so good!" Biddy moaned. "Oh, you're doing that beautifully, Steve."</p> <p>As I continued stroking into Biddy, I felt Biddy's hands on my chest, cupping my own breasts and her fingernails on the nipples which she had become terribly acquainted with as well. I could feel her body moving against me with the rhythmic movements of a bicycle as we fucked with quick short shallow strokes, as slow as the pace at which I entered Biddy's pussy.</p> <p>I felt Biddy's hands go back under my arms so she could put my hands on her waist and her feet on my butt. She was helping me move more quickly and deeper inside of Biddy, and Biddy was moaning. "Ohs, Steve, Steve. That feels so good. Ohs. I'm coming...Yes!"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She began moving faster and with Biddy's strokes, Biddy's faster's Biddy's her body she whispered—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
