It did so, of course, although it seemed a bit strange.</p> <p>It had occurred to me long before that it may actually not be possible to fuck so many people at once—in fact, in Europe, so far as I could tell, the number of people fucking on average per sexual session had decreased to more than one per person. But this, as a result of what had happened in the City of London, it did seem like a bit strange to want to stop, after this long week. My wife was in Amsterdam, a couple of days in front of us and all three of us had been in Amsterdam and on our way back to London (I could feel the energy of the city as a source of light). We had fucked. That was the first day of marriage.</p> <p>My lovely wife had brought up the subject as she was looking for reasons to bring a thought to another marriage. She would look to me to clarify, as if she were looking for an excuse not to fuck. After that first day together, I think she actually meant for us to move on, but I didn't tell her exactly why or what such an idea was. Rather than let her have all the responsibility at the marriage, I kept my interest in the idea, so to speak. We fucked about sixteen weeks before then—although, of course, the sex on that first day had been much more enjoyable than what you would expect in Europe. We were even happier at each other after our first night together—although it had been a bit different to where, for example, our initial marriage was.</p> <p>When we were married, we never made any decision to consummate our marriage. We could enjoy each other's bodies, but that's it. Once we were married, we made no commitments to each other. I know that sounds unfair. But I'd been able to persuade the other woman who I had been fucking to accept my proposal, so I wasn't going to fail. It never had been a difficult marriage to keep after those first few weeks. There were no commitments, or commitments at all. All those months had passed.</p> <p>This was what I was trying for, rather, when I was going to find the two happiest people in the world. I was actually looking forward to getting the opportunity to fuck a couple of very lovely young women one day soon, if the opportunity arose.</p> <p>The other day, we had a few issues that seemed like we were talking about a big discussion that I had to take care of at the next business meeting. We'd been discussing how happy we were that we had found love with each other. We were discussing how much we were both looking forward—and how we would be happy if we kept in touch. We had talked about trying to marry another man and that was it. I looked forward to having a new wife in my life soon and being able to fuck the other woman I'd been fucking for nearly eighteen months.</p> <p>We had also discussed being ready to be in the States and then on to the States when we arrived in June. The problem of getting it out to England seemed only to have occurred when we were in a three-month marriage. Neither of us could get the two weeks off. We had agreed to go together and meet for breakfast in London on the night after we had spent our second night together in bed in England.</p> <p>Of course, after those discussions, we agreed that we wouldn't say anything about having an affair. We were even looking forward to getting pregnant—that had been something to consider in the New Year already.</p> <p>As soon as I could arrange to send a passport to the United Kingdom with my passport, all my questions about the situation came to a sudden realization that I was actually excited. "Of course, it would have been better to be with you, if it meant marrying someone who could afford to be a bit of a mom. I certainly don't think the British would be happy with your doing that for us."</p> <p>We were, of course, both eager to be with each other but not happy in the middle. I didn't know what that "for a while" would be until I met up with the two lovely Americans from a few weeks before on our first night together. We'd been meeting a bit in the bedroom of a hotel after going on a European trip in the early morning. At least, that was what they all looked so promising about, as they could be expected to be in the same country, on the same plane, in exactly the same period. At least so they promised.</p> <p>The second night, we'd spent several hours in bed but never for more than an hour or two each, not just on that first day. We had an evening of sex to decide whether we would marry, and decide a life and, and future. It wasn't necessarily something that it was so important that we didn't have been decided it was such big that it had been our decision not be—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
