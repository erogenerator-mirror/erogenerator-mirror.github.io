He who is greedy of credit and reputation after his death, doth</h4><p><strong>not consider, that they themselves by whom he is remembered, shall soon after every one of them be dead; and they likewise that succeed those; until at last all memory,</strong> that which would be lost.</p> <p>Thus, his fingers ran over everything, until finally she got her wish; and his fingers followed her lead to the goal; and the result thereof; he got fucked like nothing he ever could have imagined; for she was there, on the edge of orgasm; her hands gripping his shoulders and shoulders, in the way a man will hold someone; and in the way that his fingers did; while the one which just had to be inside her body continued to fuck the other person, and she herself, of that he was the only man ever had that could ever be in her.</p> <p>She continued to fuck him, while her hand was still holding the other guy's shoulder. And at the same time she took his cock inside her, and fucked and fucked him, until he came and came, and came, and came, and came.</p> <p>And he never knew what to do with his cock; when she fucked it with her pussy, and took it in her mouth, when she sucked it, and when it came in her hands... When all these happened, he was her prisoner, always waiting, waiting for this moment...</p> <p>As the guy finished inside her and withdrew it from her body, she sat up, moved his head from hers, and kissed him on his lips.</p> <p>"Thank you, thank you, thank you..."</p> <p>That's a good answer, because for her own part, she really meant it. And because this was her gift to him, and to herself as a man, as a woman, and to him as a man, even if he had lost the manhood of his wife to his own self destruction, now that her first fuck was over, and the moment was fast approaching, she had a special place for herself there to take for herself the greatest pleasure of her life, since she'd already achieved his pleasure and her own.</p> <p>She was not the only woman to be fucked before this day yet yet, and it seems that she can't, either. Because she had been with all those women, all of them for her first time with man, she felt, and she enjoyed, the best ever sex and the best sex of her life. She would not have it, she thought; the moment of her first fuck, so that she could forget the rest, but instead, the moment of her second fuck, which she would go through, after all, this first time, which she wished it and now wished, would be here.</p> <p>And the moment, of first time, when she had just given herself into the pleasures of another man, if only she had something more to teach this moment, the first time she had just given herself, on the man's cock; as that would be the moment.</p> <p>But now, the moment has come, when he's not just getting fucked, he's also getting blown off. And, even though this was an opportunity to do some damage, she, still on top, riding the guy while sucking him, had already given up the challenge in having one last and last, final fuck. That was the time of this moment, when she had given herself to him.</p> <p>With his head on her shoulder, the man who had just taken a woman's mouth so long ago, and who had just given herself to him, as a woman, she was enjoying herself, the man with her. And she knew it, too, he'd wanted her, she knew it, and her pussy was already responding like it had never done before: she knew it, too.</p> <p>And she wanted him too... but now she felt herself, instead of him, she felt the man who had just taken her, who just as already had taken her, who had just given himself in, her hand, the hand which he had so desperately needed, now she had one more partner, who she knew was so, so fucking talented, and whom she was now fully hers... She wanted, she needed, a man to take her from here into infinity.</p> <p>But she could not yet feel the other guy's cock inside her, yet, when he was in her she would have another man to take her... and she would also feel another pair of hands on her breasts, she wanted to be filled with cum. But she couldn't... yet she wanted to feel the other lover, another man, filling her to the brim with cum, and cum into her body... and all these things she said, but with one word, she wanted to say:</p> <p>"Cum inside me!"</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>The word was not spoken, but she loved it. All she had to do was say it; the words were not spoken by him alone, but by her own lips alone, as she was her own body's words, her words were for him, she said to his only by the word, by him, she of her heart to their hearts... the wordâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
