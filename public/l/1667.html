She needed the sun to mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point. She had reached a stage</strong> in college where her dreams could be fulfilled. It was dark now with the last rays setting down on her. Edna took a deep breath and put her fingers in the waistband of her shorts. As her waistline was not as thick as it looked she could see a wet patch on her panties. As she pulled her panties away, Edna was aware that her fingers were trembling. She pulled the elastic band back and forth from top to bottom of the waistband causing it to rise ever higher on Edna's ass. Edna's cock sprang in excitement while she let the elastic snap back into position. She could not believe that she was actually about to fuck her own ass after years of fantasizing about it. Her own excitement would go away fast because of the thoughts going through her head.</p> <p>Eddie was about a half block away when she pulled her shorts back into position causing a huge bulge forming over the bulge from her cock. Edna's cock was semi hard since the time she had walked through the back door of her dorm. Edna's cock had been a long time since her boyfriend had fucked her ass. Now that it was at full mast, it looked like she was about to impale herself on that cock of his. Edna pulled her shorts back over her hard cock. Before she exited her dorm room she heard someone in the next block yelling, "Hey Edna that cock of your husband's is sticking out through the side of your underwear."</p> <p>Edna could already feel her face burning red. She quickly walked to her bedroom window and peered out. She felt a little embarrassed but there was no telling if anyone was going to have any idea that her ass was showing. Edna decided to take advantage of her opportunity. As she got out of her car, she slipped her shorts down her legs and then grabbed her underwear to pull it back up. She left it in place as she exited her car. As soon as Edna walked into her dorm room, she pulled her jeans and underwear back up and then headed into her dorm room. As she passed Edna's room she could hear her husband yelling for her to hurry up before he called his dad. Edna left the room without bothering to lock the door. She walked toward her husband when she stopped and said to him, "Edna, are you okay?"</p> <p>Edna was not in the mood to answer but she would put on the pretense that she was. With what is the best part of being Edna she thought her husband is always horny and always calls her baby. Edna was the only one who could remember the last time that she had been as turned on as she had been just a few days ago. Edna was still in her house when her husband came in the house. He walked into her room and found her lying on her bed nude playing on her phone. Edna knew that her husband's dad was on the phone and the reason for the call was clear to anyone who cared to look. Edna turned onto her side trying to cover up which also meant that she had left her room open and was standing just a few feet away from her husband. As Edna's husband entered her room she asked Edna to give her a massage, which Edna immediately did. Edna did not mind what is said in the massage. The more time Edna's husband spent at home alone working his hands and arms, the better it felt.</p> <p>Edna massaged her husband's entire body. She could not remember ever having received such an arousing massage before. Once Edna finished, Edna did not want to give her husband a massage before she got back home.</p> <p>Edna walked to her bed and picked up her robe. She pulled the gown over her head and then tied it tightly in a knot at the bottom. Edna turned to face her husband and kissed him on the lips. Edna's kisses were deep and long and she kissed her husband for almost as long as she was in his room. Edna broke their kiss while placing her hands in the waistband of her panties. Edna pulled them down, revealing her naked ass to her husband from behind. Edna did not bother to take her bra off to remove it. When Edna pulled her panties off, Edna did not care as she pushed her own panties off her shoulders. Edna was now completely naked before her husband and her pussy was throbbing and wet from her own wetness.</p> <p>Edna began to play with her nipples while her husband went back to work on his computer. Edna's mind was wandering but she did not want to stop looking at her husband. She could see that his cock was rising in the air, as did hers. Edna could see it was so hard and it looked even harder than in class. Edna was standing in front of a class. Edna was back at her desk. Edna.</p> <p></p> <p>Edna's husband.
