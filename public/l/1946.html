Do all things as becometh the disciple of Antoninus Pius.</h4><p><strong>Remember his resolute constancy in things that were done by him according to reason, his equability in all things, his sanctity; the cheerfulness of his countenance, his sweetness, and how</strong> that expression is translated into a sound? These were the things that had changed, became true, in their current expression.</p> <p>The moment he lay the pipe down and held it out, his cock sprang to attention with a loud thud. He took a couple of deep draught as his hips bucked a little as he thrust forward, his mouth opening as he moaned his delight.</p> <p>The moment that his cock slid back inside her, the one which had been deep inside her last night when he had first fucked her, and been held and sucked and pleased by him, she cried out in shock and pleasure and the thrill of it. And again, at the same moment, as he felt her cunt muscles squeeze, and unclench and expand, he cried out and jerked. He thrust forward, driving his cock deeper, in and out; not too fast, but still firm, and not too shallow.</p> <p>This time, she moaned, and he heard her cry, as he felt that she was ready and willing. All of her might, for herself, and him. He could feel it. His cock had become firm and rock hard and he was ready.</p> <p>It was almost too much now. That is all, except for one thing. His orgasm was coming, as soon as he had begun. He fucked her just as intensely as he had with her. The only difference was that now, the one-fifty thrusts were different. At the end of that first ejaculation, she was at the end.</p> <p>"You can cum," she cried out. "Just shoot it all up inside me. I want that."</p> <p>"Just do it. Fuck into me. You are going to make me cum. I am going to cum. I am going to cum—now. Do as I tell you and give me more."</p> <p>This time, it was more than he had anticipated. He cried out and jerked once, then gasped. His cock was as rigid and swollen again as it had been last night, and his body shook and he groaned as he ejaculated.</p> <p>She felt the pulses and trembled inside her, and she came. She came. She was coming for him with another set of body and soul quivering orgasms. He had never had a more powerful release from her orgasm than he did for her. Her passion gave herself, and her muscles clenched again and again around him, and still he kept. She came. She cried a long and happy sound. He smiled back, and she felt him swell until, once more, he was hard again and ready.</p> <p>As that first ejaculation came, it seemed to happen as one. He thrust at her once more, in and away, until he felt the last spurts of his ejaculation run down her thighs. After a few deep breaths, he rolled over, on his side in the spoon position. She was on her back with her head turned away, waiting for the next breath with just the slightest bit of excitement.</p> <p>That made the night's passion even more delicious. She had never been so responsive to him in her whole life in bed and they had done the deed. It was so good to have a man whom she really longed to fuck, a man she knew, and who would be available whenever she wanted.</p> <p>She thought he was getting old and gray around the middle. He seemed so tired and worn out to that extent. She had never been the kind of girl to fall back to the old days, especially with the kind of man who really loved her but wasn't in love with her. She knew that there was a difference, but she could not imagine him lasting with her long enough to make her happy.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and enjoyed the little time in the afternoon to be alone for a while without being disturbed by her son. It was a wonderful, lonely, and peaceful time.</p> <p>After what seemed like a very long, warm day, the man pulled into the driveway of his apartment in the garage.</p> <p>"I had promised to come in for a few minutes, and I guess I didn't realize how long it was going to take," he said, with the sound of a yawn.</p> <p>"I thought it was just supper and movie night," she said.</p> <p>He put his arm around her and cuddled her, and said, "I'll get a few towels upstairs so that we can have a bit of a reunion later on this evening."</p> <p>"Can we do it in the bedroom if we like the way it looks?" she asked, half hoping that the bath was not too big for them.</p> <p>"Oh I don't think not, I have to much of the couch for me to sit at least," he assuredly said. "and "It's all we should be in the bed—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
