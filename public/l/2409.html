Your choice is your name!</p> <p>It felt good, right? My hand moved to feel his ass, he gave it a tight squeeze, I could feel his asshole relax; I moved my penis slowly in his ass. I was sure if I put it in there, that his ass and asshole would be completely free of any unwanted influences. I felt his pussy juice that ran down his thighs, he must do the same.</p> <p>"Let me feel your pussy," he demanded.</p> <p>"If you want your own hand, just go ahead." I told him.</p> <p>He did too. He reached under and put two of his long fingers in his mouth.</p> <p>"Ohh!" I moaned.</p> <p>"That's nice, but be gentle," he said.</p> <p>"I'll be okay," I answered.</p> <p>"Then just move your hand back and forth and keep going." I said.</p> <p>A finger was now inside his ass. It didn't feel too bad to feel a man's anus. He moaned like he really liked this, maybe because his cock was hard, I guess it didn't hurt much. I slowly moved my penis in and out of that ass, he moaned and put his fingers to his mouth, showing me how much he liked his ass being teased. I was hard too. I wondered if he'd let me fuck his ass while we were in bed, if I could get it open just like a condom, if it should feel good too. It seemed a little uncomfortable with my dick in his ass. I didn't feel like I was hurting him. I had no problems getting his cock ready before I started my journey my way. His body looked ready to receive my dick. I pulled back; his hole remained still, but I pushed forward. I put my hands on his shoulders to hold him still. I liked that he didn't complain about me moving it.</p> <p>"It feels good to be in your ass," I said, I wanted the same. I moved it in.</p> <p>"That's good," I said, "just move."</p> <p>"I don't care," I said.</p> <p>"No, fuck me!" I answered. "Yes, now."</p> <p>I put my cock to his hole.</p> <p>"Slow, I like it slow," I said. "Push it in slow." I kept my cock still, and he pushed. My ass was slightly open. I slid the head past it into his ass, about an inch, just enough to stay there. My cock was still semi-hard and I was enjoying it. He was so hot, so wet, more beautiful than when I'd last been in a girl's pussy. It felt so good. He moved his ass slowly, like I was going to push it back every other step. The feeling was incredible, I'd never done something like this. I felt some pressure against my erection. I wanted it. I'd wait for him. I wanted it. I slowly pushed further into his ass, I could take all of my self control not to just shove the whole thing in, maybe I should just push it inside. I didn't.</p> <p>"Fuck," I moaned, "it feels good. You're pushing it through."</p> <p>"It's okay," he said. "It feels good to be in my ass."</p> <p>"I want to feel you cum in my ass," I said, "I want you to cum in my ass." He didn't say a word, just let me do all the talking. I moved my cock a little more, "it's okay." Then I pushed it further inside. I moved it a little more.</p> <p>"Wait!" I said as I pushed even more.</p> <p>"It's right after you cum in. It's okay," he said, "I want to feel you cum in my ass." I could hear him sigh.</p> <p>"I love it so much," I admitted.</p> <p>"Oh wow," he said while letting some of his tension loose.</p> <p>"I'll try it again," I said, "but we'll have to stop."</p> <p>I pulled out a bit to just a slight part and then pushed it back in slowly a bit more, I still felt some pressure, no pain, more pleasure. He started his moaning again.</p> <p>"Oh God!" he moaned, "I can feel it," "I can feel it running down my legs," "I can feel my cock going in and out." There were other words of passion too, then there were words but they were words of love or words or words of pleasure, only.</p> <p>"I should I said.</p> <p>It felt so much better," I want so much," Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
