English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER II</h4><p><strong>“And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my room?” But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one</strong> in his room as the door opened. “And he is here,” she thought to himself. Now he is here… and I can’t hide from him. It would be like hiding in a cage. I am naked… his daughter, and she is naked. I am going to fuck her.”</p> <p>His voice startled her from her fantasy. She heard the door open and he spoke. ”What’s that?”</p> <p>She could hear the rustling of garments at her feet. He quickly removed his clothing and they stood awkwardly looking at each other. She slowly walked towards him and held the doorframe to his chest. He lowered his mouth towards her and she felt her breath escaping her lips. She wanted him so much, for now, at least. Her arms were around his neck and she could barely feel his arms against her sides but the sight of him moving towards her brought her very little protection against him. He closed his eyes just long enough for her to feel his hard cock pressing against her belly. She couldn’t stop smiling right at this moment.</p> <p>He placed his hands around her waist, pressing them gently together. The smell of her hair and the feel of her close to him was intoxicating. She could feel a damp patch growing along the skin of her legs. His lips were hot on her cheek, and she leaned closer to him. He whispered very quietly in her ear.</p> <p>“I haven’t seen you in a long time.”</p> <p>“I can’t hide this from you. I must look sexy if anyone walks in on us.”</p> <p>He reached his hand around her waist in a tight embrace, pulling her closer to him so they were touching and holding each other for that whole eternity. She knew that he had to be fully inside her, and she could feel the heat from his body. Her fingers instinctively reached to his hard cock. She felt the head of his cock press against her and then, in one swift motion, she pressed against him, taking him inside her completely. His hands were exploring her breasts again, and his cock pulsed against her stomach. She was moving with him, sliding up his hardness. She could feel it inside her. So much of it came out the top of his dick. She gripped around him and held his head firmly. She felt him press against her and pull back, so that she couldn’t go farther inside. He held to her as though she would somehow stop him, but it just felt right. He was inside her too, but he didn’t want to stop, and he would have to come out of her if she felt ready.</p> <p>Slowly, carefully, he took his cock out, then she felt it rubbing along her legs, against her inner thighs and belly. Then, the tip touched her pussy and then, the rest, the tip touched her clitoris and it made her gasp and moan in a very sexy way. He continued to move until they were both moving up and down very fast. Finally, he held still inside her and she started thrusting against his cock. His hips moved in response to her movements. Her nipples were already hard and aching against his chest. Both of her hands were gripping his ass in her grip. She squeezed hard on his ass as he continued to be in her. They were both moaning more and more loudly now. She could feel the tip of him and felt her fingers rubbing all over the place where they met her body and his body. She loved his taste. She didn’t mind it anymore. She enjoyed his taste. And she loved what she was doing with one man, two men. Her fingers would move up, and then to the tip of his dick and then down, back up again. She loved it. Her fingers slid over the tip again for a long time.</p> <p>“Oh, God.” she gasped and could barely make words. She moved her hands so fast that they didn’t stop until she had pushed his face into her breasts. She needed to taste him. She wanted to taste the skin of his face against hers, to suck her breasts and feel his cock deep inside her. Her orgasm had been building all day long and now it was finally coming. She was ready to cum, and she was ready to cum hard and deep.</p> <p>Her body tensed. Her fingers moved and she moved faster towards her fingers and his head pushing against her pelvis with every thrust of her own. Her fingers moved deeper and harder inside her pussy. She needed to be the one of them in her at the moment. She needed to be one of moment of time of the moment of moment that they needed to be one of the moment of moment. She knew that she was the moment of their time one that had touched the moment of the time of moments of perfect. She wanted and a moment they wanted together that had their—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
