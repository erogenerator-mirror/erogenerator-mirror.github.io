There was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown. Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which</strong> was perfect enough for their first night on an ancient ship.</p> <p>The ship was still in port and the moonlight was just barely visible through glazed-over glasses, but they could not see inside the ship. It was a vast expanse of white that the ship could make out in any direction.</p> <p>Kira's body was a vision of her voluptuous form, her soft tits, her big thighs, her tight ass. If you knew her, you would think that her body was an inspiring sight to her, not to mention beautiful to look at.</p> <p>As they sat on the bed, Coketown seemed to go on forever except for moments. The first stars were beginning to fade; then they turned dark, and then became bright.</p> <p>They never talked or laughed during sex, or even about it.</p> <p>The only way they ever came out was because of their mutual desire for her.</p> <p>There was something about her being a young American woman that catered to the old west. It made her feel good to have a young American woman and yet she was different. It made her feel like the young American female. Like a young American college student, like Kiana.</p> <p>There was something special about her.</p> <p>Coketown's thighs were so delicate, she didn't have any skin exposed from them to the ground, and they were so soft, she didn't have the bones of youth that Kiana and the young American woman were. Her calves, her knees, her thighs, her calves: all the bones that her body contained were the bones of a young American woman's legs, something Kiana was the more powerful of the two. Her calves were shapely and soft, giving her a sexual strength like none Kiana had ever felt before.</p> <p>All this was to her advantage because of her father, which was the reason this woman had brought her here.</p> <p>She was young enough to be their daughter, and she was a young American woman.</p> <p>Her thighs looked so soft and feminine from where they lie on the silk sheets underneath. And when she was naked, and she was getting ready to take off her clothes, there was a whole range of parts that were exposed to the ocean. Everywhere she was, all of her limbs were exposed to the sea. And whenever she was sitting on a bed with a pair of men, there was one of them.</p> <p>Her skin was like the lightest sand under her skin, and she felt wonderfully warm. The sea felt warm to her, as she felt warm to the two men. And from where they were resting, you could hear a low rumble that was like a bell. It was not a noise made by a yacht's rigging.</p> <p>"Don't think," said the man behind Kiana, "that I won't notice that you don't have any clothes in you."</p> <p>"I don't think," said the woman, smiling. "You really want to?"</p> <p>In response, Coketown leaned over and touched both of her breasts. She pressed them together with one hand and caressed her own nipples, making them stiff and erect. Then, without warning, Coketown's lips were on her breasts and her tongue began to travel downwards. She licked her lips. Coketown had her neck in a relaxed stance and the back to her neck, with her shoulders and the back of her head, her long hair all over the place. Her large breasts seemed to be a delicate flower, so delicate and sexy that Coketown couldn't be sure that she could make such things happen. All that she tried was to imagine having men's lips on them. She could imagine the two of them embracing one another, her breasts pressing against Coketown's naked body. Coketown's hands reached behind her and pulled on her ass. And those hands were just a few inches away from caressing Coketown's pussy.</p> <p>But Kiana also wanted it.</p> <p>Coketown wasn't just being coy, she was seducing her. Her pussy ached for her young friend's mouth on it, her lips and her tongue on her.</p> <p>"Kira," she said, "I can't tell you what to do next. Tell me what to do."</p> <p>Even though Coketown thought to herself that it would be impossible, she did as she was told.</p> <p>"Kira, please, go suck on these," Kiana said, "I want you to make love to me."</p> <p>When Coketown reached Kiana's head, she could see that she was smiling. Kiana's her mouth was wide and beautiful.</p> <p>that's was her breasts were firm and lovely, of her soft and were soft and beautiful. It was full of a womanly of fine and of womanly of womanly of womanlyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
