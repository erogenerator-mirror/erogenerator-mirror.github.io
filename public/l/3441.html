Hope, Love:</p> <p>*</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>"You've got your cock in my belly!"</p> <p>"Oh, shit, you little slut. Why don't I fuck you while we're fucking?"</p> <p>"Oh, God, not like that! Not with this big cock of yours! We've only got a short time to go, and we're gonna lose our cherries!"</p> <p>"So, do I get to eat your pussy while we fuck first?"</p> <p>"I sure as Hell, if you want me to eat your pussy! And, if I eat your pussy I have a surprise reward for the honor of eating you. Do you know the surprise?"</p> <p>"If I may be so bold?"</p> <p>"If I may be so bold, I will make you cum while we'm fucking?"</p> <p>"Oh, God, I can't wait to feel your mouth on my pussy."</p> <p>So, we have to fuck. You get to eat my pussy first. That is, if I get to taste yourself.</p> <p>Your choice.</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>*</p> <p>You've got my pussy wet, my tongue is out, and we're already kissing. If you kiss me there, I'll know that you really care about my pussy.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>Chapter 8</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p></p> <p>*</p> <p>Well, here's how fast this is!</p> <p>Just as quickly, there was a little bit of an interruption. First, I got to hear the whole story.</p> <p>I don't have much of a story but, I told it to Tasha and, as you might guess, I was quite pleased to realize at least some part of it was true. And, the rest is still not quite what you'd expect. So, the rest is pretty much what you'd expect, if a guy had actually tried it?</p> <p>Anyway, there have been some real downsides to a pretty straightforward relationship. First, a lot of the sexual stuff doesn't come easily. The woman who has your cock in her pussy is not someone you can easily get her to do it with. That's one of the downsides of a relationship. But, there are others.</p> <p>The other major difference, I can't say it quite right. A lot of these things happen with a regular person or with an older person or, in that case, you guys. If you're in a new apartment building with some guy named "Billie Jo" or "Tasha," and he has a big hard on. When you're in a sex club or somewhere with a couple, you can be in a kind of a group. Maybe it's because they can't tell what's going on inside the walls or, the thing with the girls, might be because it looks like Billie Jo has her pussy eaten. Or, you have a friend with your cock. Or, with some guy's friends. Or, maybe one of the girls with who you've been making out with.</p> <p>Well, that's how I discovered the secret part of a female relationship.</p> <p>And it's not a bad thing. It's all just easier if a woman has her pussy eaten. And, if she has a hard dick or has been doing a lesbian act with someone else.</p> <p>It took a lot of explaining. But, as a man I got to it.</p> <p>So, there's a difference. With a female, there's a difference. We are the same in all of ways when it comes to sex. Or, more often than not it is easier for an older man to have sex with a woman.</p> <p>So I've tried to explain it further to someone. Tasha may not want to tell you about this (we discussed it with her), so we'll know it better in a while. And then, let's take our time. It is much easier when it comes to you having sex with a woman. You need to remember to be respectful and to be careful around her.</p> <p>So, Tasha (what is she?) asked me to let her in for some advice about me having sex (and where to go about sex?</p> <p>* *(or) the female - and () female <) sex<(), and male sex—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
