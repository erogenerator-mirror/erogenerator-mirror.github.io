But when it is a beloved and intimate</strong> being, it gives you a strong sense of nostalgia. And it was very enjoyable for me to have made love to a dying, breathing, body of water.</p> <p>It's a feeling I've come to a lot in the last 10 days. And if I can't get to this point, I'm going to leave the world of humanity to dwell on the past.</p> <p>"I've already fucked, I've even cheated, I've even cheated, and I've even fucked in front of my wife and my children," Will confessed. "I have a big day tomorrow."</p> <p>He knew that this year was going to be a special one. He wanted to give his new wife a big, hot, beautiful Valentine's Day Day Valentine's present. This Valentine's Day morning, he was going to give a young, beautiful, sexy, nubile young woman something to think about while he fucked her in a way that she never could. He needed to make his special day special for both of them, too.</p> <p>In the way his wife and his daughter all fell hopelessly in love with two other men, Will felt special for them too. He felt special that two of the best men in his twenty years and even more important that he wasn't the only single man in the world who was the one feeling the same, if it was only a man who felt special.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>When Will and Jennifer made love, they were having a romantic and erotic time. Their relationship and their lust for each other continued to develop over the many years when Will came home and caught Will on his cell phone. He heard some of the things he said about Will and Jennifer on their cell phones and hoped he'd forgive them. He couldn't see the love in Jennifer's eyes at that moment, but he knew it would be there for a long time.</p> <p>"Did you think about me as you fucked my wife?" Will asked Will, which caused Jennifer to smile. "When did you find out? Because I certainly can tell you how excited I am for you," she thought to herself when she heard what he just said.</p> <p>"Did you want to know how to stop it or what it feels like for you to do it, too?" she said, laughing.</p> <p>"Well, actually I've been thinking it over," Will confessed. "I've been thinking a lot about Will since the first time we've had sex. I've found that I can think things through in a way that others can't. Will, would you like to fuck Jennifer?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh, Will, you have no idea how much it's flattering to hear you say that," Jennifer said with a grin. "It makes the love we already have grow in us. When I told Will about you, he said it made us even - we've been the best couple ever!"</p> <p>"I had so much thought of you and I being intimate, but I never imagined marrying such a wonderful young woman as Jennifer," he told her. "I just wanted to spend Valentine's Days on a new level with you. I really was surprised that I had thought this much about Jennifer in advance, but I had my doubts. You are a beautiful girl, you have beautiful breasts, and you've always seemed so comfortable talking to me about your feelings," he added.</p> <p>Then he added, "But, I'll confess that I wasn't prepared to feel so comfortable with you as I did with Will until I saw you in action with Will," Jennifer said.</p> <p>"Oh, Will, you were so handsome. I couldn't believe how beautiful you were. You are just so beautiful," she said. "And I loved that you talked so openly about your feelings," she said with a laugh. "You're so handsome and so sexy, Will. I've never seen you more beautiful than in your clothes. So, now that we've got some time together, I want to see you naked," she said, then she smiled and moved closer to him.</p> <p>She looked into his eyes as she pressed her lips against his. He felt her full, soft lips touch his as they kissed him. They felt so right. It was really turning Will on. After all these years, he felt that he wanted to make love to another woman for the first time in his entire life, and that it was going to be more than that.</p> <p>Will didn't say anything about it at first but he got a bit more of a warm feeling in his heart and a little deeper in his panties when Jennifer placed her fingers on his neck. When her lips descended upon him, he felt her tongue brush his lips.</p> <p>'down through his lips and enter his mouth. This night was the space that had just a very special feeling for both of them and for each of them to kiss. He and all. Will. Will was heaven they were meant to be joined like a happy and enjoyed and enjoyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
