Whensoever by some present hard occurrences thou art constrained to</h4><p><strong>be in some sort troubled and vexed, return unto thyself as soon as may be, and be not out of tune longer than thou must needs. For so shalt thou</strong> be, and be in tune with thyself. be in tune with theeself, and be in tune with thyself, and be in tune with yourself.</p> <p>"It is the day our souls will be reunited, the day thyself shall rekindle thyself within the spirit of that which ye call it. It be at his earliest moment, a day before thou thou shalt wed, and your son shall meet thyself and return into thy body."</p> <p>"And what then do thou want, Father?" asked Lass, with an eager tone, her blue eyes shining like emeralds, a wicked sparkle sparkling in her amber eyes.</p> <p>"Well," said Droll, his voice a bit hoarse, "do you want me to put up with my son?"</p> <p>"Droll," said the priest, pausing, "What in the name of heaven do you mean? The day that heaven shall be reunited with thyself, thou shalt be in tune with theeself, and thou shall rekindle thyself."</p> <p>"Well," said the priest, looking down in mock seriousness, "that is the question I have to ask you."</p> <p>"Not yet," said the priest. "But later I shall," he added, "And it shall be our little time as we wish."</p> <p>"Well, I do want," said Droll, her eyes brimming with excitement. "And I like what I want, and I want a good fucking."</p> <p>"But," said the priest, "the moment thou hast taken thee by the cock, you shall not be able to say or do anything else, unless, God has granted a little mercy to you, and I have taken the opportunity of having such a good time as always."</p> <p>"Well," said Lass, "the moment thou hath taken thyself away, so now you have to give it up to the priest. And I want it, so that I may fuck thee whenever thee so desire. How shall I, after the priest has given me up, be able to say 'oh, yes, give it all to me, Father!"</p> <p>"As my son," said the priest, "as thou commands," he spoke in his rich, raspy voice again, and Droll turned quickly, as the priest quickly rose to his feet and came around Droll's feet, his eyes boring into her face and into Droll's.</p> <p>With a smile, the priest smiled, then kissed Lass and took a seat on the altar.</p> <p>Lass, after a moment's hesitation, began to undress down to her thong. Droll did not remove her panties, just sat down on the altar and peeled her thong down over her knees.</p> <p>She lay down on her back on the altar, legs spread and her chest rising, her heart beating faster in anticipation and anticipation of the pleasure to come.</p> <p>Droll looked at the altar for, to Lass's delight, a small white bowl appeared within it. As the priest climbed up on the altar and took over, Lass's hand reached out and clasped his shaft.</p> <p>"Is this what thou desires, father?" she asked, smiling over her shoulder.</p> <p>"The priest, yes, but also thy own son," answered Droll. She looked up at the priest with her eyes filled with wanton desire. "Does that make you want me, father?" she asked.</p> <p>"I think so," he said.</p> <p>Lass reached into the bowl and pulled out a small pink plastic bowl held in her hand by a small, red-tipped studded metal ring.</p> <p>"Open it." Said the priest.</p> <p>Droll opened the pink bowl and looked at the ring and was thrilled.</p> <p>"How does it do that?" she asked.</p> <p>"It is a key," said Droll, "and it unlocks thy soul."</p> <p>"Aye, I thought so," said the Priest's beautiful eyes as he gazed down Lass's body with adoring devotion. "What, mother?" Lass asked.</p> <p>"My dear daughter, is this a key?" asked Droll as she held the pink pendant in my hand.</p> <p>"Perhaps, father," Lass replied.</p> <p>"Perhaps?" asked Droll with a pout. "Well, it does not work that way."</p> <p>Droll held the pink pendant and gazed at it a bit more deeply between her parted lips. "How so?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you want to see what happens," replied Lass.</p> <p>Droll held the pink pendant in front of her face. "Will do you?" she asked.</p> <p>"What," he answered Lass replied and Droll looked up at Lass and up at the priest. "I want," said they both.
