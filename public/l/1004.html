He sat down beside her and began to think. Little by little, as he gazed at her, he</strong> began to make out with her. He couldn't believe that it had been all day.</p> <p>He looked up when he heard her soft moans. Leaning over, he kissed her eyelids. She began to moan louder. Leaning back, she sat up slightly to get him close to her. She looked into his eyes.</p> <p>"Is it alright when you look at my eyes?" she purred. He nodded in response then kissed her again, taking turns sucking on her tongue.</p> <p>"I still can't believe that it felt so good" she moaned as she ran her fingers through his hair.</p> <p>He began to kiss his way down her neck towards her ear. He began to work his way down her throat to the tops of her breasts... he stopped short of her right nipple.</p> <p>"Hmmm.." she moaned as she felt him run his long fingers across her small breast.</p> <p>"I can't believe you're doing this" he moaned as he gently squeezed his fingers between her breasts. She couldn't believe this feeling. This was just like a dream.</p> <p>"I don't want you to stop" she moaned over and over and over again.</p> <p>He could barely take the pressure anymore. He took a deep breath in and out of his lungs. He began to slide her dress off her body. He quickly moved from her neck, along her breasts, to her stomach. He kissed and licked one then the other for so long that he thought she might pass out. He moved his head up until he was kissing her again, slowly he kissed down her belly. He stopped just before her shaved pussy.</p> <p>Her pussy smelled like musky scented scents that caused his cock to throb. He didn't know why he wanted that feeling anymore. The desire was like nothing he had ever felt.</p> <p>He spread her legs wide. She spread her pussy with her fingers and begged for him.</p> <p>"Fuck me" she said softly in a sexy voice.</p> <p>His mind raced with the need for her, as he began to kiss her inner thigh just inside her pussy, and back up.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for this for so long" she purred in a breathy voice.</p> <p>She loved that he looked down in her eyes so long. She could smell herself on his lips and smiled, when he licked his lips.</p> <p>"Now it's my turn to feel you" she purred back. She laid back down on his bed and he spread her legs. She spread wide for him as he began to lick her pussy. He stuck his tongue deep and fucked her. He licked her juices off his finger and began to work it with his tongue. He worked his tongue in circles on her clit and she moaned.</p> <p>"You're so wet baby, you taste so good" he moaned into her pussy as he licked her juices.</p> <p>Her hips began to move on their own. Her moans were now deep and uncontrolled. He worked his finger faster with her pussy. She wanted him inside her now. He stopped, kissing his way up her thigh to kiss her pussy. He loved the taste of her, it made him so fucking horny. He felt so bad that he didn't get the chance to taste her yet.</p> <p>It turned him on even further to be able to touch her. He felt her fingers as they began to pull his shirt up. Her hands were rough and he was very aroused knowing that he could make her feel all good.</p> <p>With his shirt still on, he began to work his hands all over her body. His fingers explored her breast, then her pussy. He teased her pussy with his tongue and fingers. He knew she was about to cum... but only enough to make her cum. He didn't have to be gentle; she wasn't allowed to cum yet. After she'd cum he needed to fuck her so badly. Her juices dripped down his chin. He stuck his tongue deep inside her pussy. She had to be sooooo fucking wet. He didn't realize how loud she was when she began to moan as the waves of pleasure rocked her body.</p> <p>As he slid his finger inside her, he had to taste her cum as she'd never tasted it. His tongue worked in circles around her clit. His fingers continued to work in and out of her pussy. Just when she started to come down, he slid his fingers out of her.</p> <p>"You're going to be so good baby, making me cum" she moaned as she slid off the bed. She began to strip off his shirt. She couldn't believe what she was seeing again. She had never seen this before. She thought she was so hot and she wasn't there was an instant. "My baby. She started to just like a woman" this" with this" she said she began walking around his clothes and began—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
