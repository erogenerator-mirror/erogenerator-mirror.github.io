That which must be the subject of thy consideration, is either the</h4><p><strong>matter itself, or the dogma, or the operation, or the true sense and signification.</strong> We would not just be in the middle of an orgy if we let this be: Sex.</p> <p>Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. This was just what we needed to make it fun.</p> <p>So it was with that mindset, that we got a big idea. Now, if sex is fun, no offense, but you would not believe it to anyone but a little bit of an expression, "sex has consequences."</p> <p>There is no harm in having an orgasm. It is safe sexual relations, and in addition it is fun. To the uninitiated the pleasures of another partner occur naturally.</p> <p>We do not all come out to orgasm on our own, however, it is perfectly safe sexual relations.</p> <p>A couple of things that can help you make the right decision, are the fact that you choose Sex, a very rare event between two lovers. For the uninitiated, Sex can be all about sex and all about pleasure.</p> <p>Sex should be about sex.</p> <p>We should all be horny like animals.</p> <p>Sex should help you relax so you will feel ready to jump on a Harley.</p> <p>Sex should drive your muscles like a piston.</p> <p>Sex should be like driving a Ferrari.</p> <p>And sex should be more fun than driving the fastest, most expensive car you have ever seen.</p> <p>Sex can be all about sex and more of those.</p> <p>The more you take, the hotter you are going to feel, and the better the sex is.</p> <p>Sex may start the summer with a great vacation on the Riviera that could result in great sex-free vacations.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Thanks for reading my writingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
