A man, I would call him. In reality, there were a number of them, but only one had ever been inside of me. And, I'd go back to what it felt like to be penetrated by his hardness. I'd always, however, find myself craving it more frequently. One of my earliest, and very intense masturbatory dreams was of his cock inside of me. One day, when we were alone - and I was kneeling on my bed - one of our friends, an older version of herself, had mentioned how much of an impact and pleasure it could make on me with their sexual activities. We all assumed he wanted a private part in my life and wanted to share it with us, too. As you might imagine, I was averse to an "anal" encounter with Peter's manhood, while he was just a bit less circumspect with our friend.</p> <p>But, we had our friend, of course - it had to be my roommate, in fact. I was a bit taken aback at how well I could take on these three men at once, and with each thrust he made into my cunt, I let out a sigh, and the two of them each moved down my body, kissing my breasts and sucking my nipples. When Peter found my entrance and, without hesitation, slid inside me, it was as hot as it had ever been, and I was as ready as I'd ever been to be taken by a cock: a cock was always like a hot rod, it just got to me more quickly. I've always wanted to be taken by a cock and used like it was, but with that thought, I was still a little hesitant, so I asked, "Would you rather I'd be astride Peter's dick than do that?"</p> <p>His reply was, without preamble, "No. I'd never go that far, if that would be all right with you."</p> <p>But, when I felt myself getting off (and I'm no prude of anyone), I just smiled and said, "Don't forget to let me know when you've recovered."</p> <p>With the first stroke inside me, he withdrew a little, then sank deep inside. He was able to go quite fast, and was obviously well versed in what worked, in what was happening to me. But, I was getting turned on by him too. While one of Peter's hands was holding my hip tight, his free hand was stroking a nipple, while he started pumping me very slowly and deeply, while the other hand was now on my clit, rubbing that wonderfully sensitive button. I knew I couldn't keep quiet, and suddenly a deep groan started deep in my throat and vibrated through my belly.</p> <p>The first sign of my orgasm was when Peter started pumping fast again, his breath was coming in ragged intakes as an orgasm burst inside me, followed by a grunt (and a muffled moan) before he too, erupted.</p> <p>I don't know how much time passed between us, but when he pulled out and started cumming over my belly and breast, I came hard.</p> <p>But, as we'd been waiting for me, it wasn't long before Peter, when Peter had finished cumming, pulled out of me, and started a fresh, strong orgasm.</p> <p>I fell forward on my stomach, breathing very heavily. Peter had moved next to my head, his cock still exposed, and had been stroking it, slowly, slowly, in time with our friends' movements. As they did, I could hear Peter whisper, "And I won't forget yours anytime soon."</p> <p>With a smile I asked, between deep breaths, "What do you say, guys, after all a birthday, we'll come back to your bed one last time."</p> <p>Peter smiled back at me, still moving the tip of his cock to and fro.</p> <p>With that, I turned over and was again the subject of discussion. The four of them had not said anything to me about it, not yet, eitherâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
