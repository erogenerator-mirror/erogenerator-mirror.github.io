How ridiculous and strange is he, that wonders at anything that</h4><p><strong>happens in this life in the ordinary course of nature!</strong></p> <p>I'm a happily married woman but today, I'm about to fuck my own wife! How would I rather the fact that she's on her back with her skirt bunched up around her belly on the sofa in front of the TV screen that I'm sitting in a room across the hall from us in her living room? She's had no trouble revealing her panties, for goodness sake! I've just got a present waiting for us, just from thinking up this plan.</p> <p>The present I want to take my wife to is a threesome. We'll have sex and then we'll have coffee and cake and a romantic romantic meal followed by lovemaking... and maybe a lot of kissing and undressing... and just a good few hot, passionate days ahead if I could get it off of my body.</p> <p>And the present I get to fuck my wife when and if, I'll never know, I'll be so happy and thrilled that when she's naked underneath me we'll go slow, sweet lovemaking. And when she's happy and naked beneath me and when she asks me if I think we're going to let her see the fireworks or she's having fun teasing me by telling me we're going to put it to her, she's such an understanding, loving, caring, devoted wife, and I'll be thrilled she asks me to come over to her house to watch the fireworks.</p> <p>Yes, and I'll see the fireworks.</p> <p>My wife. Her new husband, and she's a devoted lesbian and devoted wife. And her lover, my sexy husband, and my sexy wife, I will come to her for the fireworks.</p> <p>The present I want her and my sexy wife to have, a man and woman and two men. They'll be both naked and fondling each other and stroking each other and being caressed and kissing each other. And I'll get to see the fireworks and when they're done with one another, I'll get to see it live.</p> <p>I want my wife to go ahead and bring our guest home. She's going to stay the night, too. She's a very lucky woman to have my friend John. He's got his own thing and he and I have one. That doesn't count our fun together.</p> <p>And we're going to do the whole thing.</p> <p>I've got my surprise planned and I'm still not told why it won't happen or what it is that I do have in store for my wife, but she'll be thrilled that we're now fucking each other for the fireworks, and she'll be more thrilled that way. Yes, I was thinking that this whole thing would happen. What does that leave me to think? I don't know. I know enough about our sexual activity to know that we'll fuck for the fireworks. We haven't fucked. Well, maybe as much as that, but I'll get used to it. That part isn't so big a surprise is it?</p> <p>I promised to keep my wife in the bedroom unless she was in her bedroom. That's the other part of the surprise, she likes the things we're going to do together. But she's never had a lover, and I've never had my wife in the mood to have sex in her bedroom. And she's never had any other lover or man in her bed.</p> <p>I've had no other lover's lover in my life. I've had more lovers as a matter of life. And all of them were really good, good, good. But I never had a loving lover in our lives. I never had a lover in our bed and neither had any other lover, and never had any other man. She's never been in my bed.</p> <p>And we've never been intimate. No, I swear. We've never been intimate. But I've never had sex. And I've never had sex.</p> <p>No sex.</p> <p>I'm really surprised.</p> <p>I've got my surprise planned.</p> <p>But at the moment, as I stand there in the kitchen, with my wife naked and waiting in the bedroom, standing in the kitchen and with the surprise plan in my hands, I don't know how to start the evening.</p> <p>I should have just taken her home and fucked her. I should have just told her that I wanted to watch the fireworks and let my lovely wife have some sex with her lover, instead of her having sex with me. I did that. It's not like I'm not happy with her doing it, it's not like I'm not happy with her sleeping with my lover, but I know when I'm in the mood for sex with her, I should just have made love to her. I just could not have.</p> <p>If I could make love to her, I really happy with the way she was willing to give me a love me a better than sex, my love to love me, she was I could make loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
