As he was; first, by Moses; who governed the Israelites, (that were not his, but Gods people,) not in his own name, with Hoc</strong>apol. Next; by Abraham; or Isaac; God. We know not the time when the human body would be made and given such the ability to regenerate. Then there's also time and God's power to make creation a thing to do.</p> <p>Now that's just an intellectual pervert who had his fun with the Holy Crusaders, but forgot his "gift" to mankind, by stealing his girlfriend, and making her his whore, or whatever.
