Tonight was her birthday -- she was celebrating and it meant that she was going to have the best birthday of her life, a momentous time which would change the lives of two of the most beloved people she had ever met.</p> <p>"Dani, we're in town for a convention on International Business Machines, I guess, we could go do a little shopping," Gavroche said with a smile as he put his arm around her middle one final time as he felt Dani's thigh press tightly to his as they walked.</p> <p>"Nah, that's fine with me. This might be the last day we're here, we're heading to a convention. How much time do we have so far?"</p> <p>Gavroche looked at the clock that had displayed the last minutes of their time together. He looked deep into Dani's eyes as she took his hand and held his hand to her breast, his hand sliding into her blouse and under her bra to fondle her naked breast.</p> <p>"How much time is it?" Gavroche asked her.</p> <p>"Oh, it's so late, it's my birthday; I really feel like a million dollars," she said as she squeezed his hand even tighter against her. "So much more than just my birthday," she added as she turned towards Gavroche and slid her hand around his waist to press even more tightly against his cock.</p> <p>The two young people were both getting hornier by the moment as they continued holding each other. A sudden shift in the room made Gavroche turn towards the side and turn towards Dani for a moment and a moment later as he felt the tip of Gavroche's cock nuzzling against her leg, they were making a bit of an entrance to the bathroom.</p> <p>"It's about time," Gavroche said as he started to lead Dani towards a stall of something. "Here -- we've even already gone in there!"</p> <p>"Well, it is about time. Gavroche, what do we do now?"</p> <p>"Well, it's about time," Gavroche said to Dani as he pulled her inside the stall. The room was in darkness, but that could only go so far as to make Dani's brain still work. Her eyes lit up as she closed the door and then she reached down in between the stall and the sink to find the water for the tub.</p> <p>"Here? When is this going to happen?" Gavroche said as he helped Dani inside the first stall of the bathroom.</p> <p>"It's my birthday, Gavroche," Dani said as she reached up and took her hand from the sink and started taking off her pants and panties. "I had so many birthday plans for this year and now I'm going to have this party, right here," she said as she pulled the shower curtain aside to expose Gavroche. "I hope Gavroche has a nice, big cock. Oh, I hope so. And maybe he may have one for me, too," she added with a smile to emphasize the comment as she turned away from Gavroche and started to step under the shower while facing towards the mirror on the wall.</p> <p>"Oh, I will have every man's cock I want from now on, sweetheart. Oh, and Gave the most beautiful birthday fuck ever."</p> <p>Dani stepped into the shower behind Gavroche as Gavroche pulled her tight against him.</p> <p>"Come on, Dani, let's do it!" Gavroche said with a smile as he turned her towards the shower so that his hands were on her back. "We'll make it last just like last year," he added and pushed his cock into her asscrack.</p> <p>"Oh that feels good. I'm very glad you have my ass. It's so smooth for me! Mmm," Dani said as she reached down to grasp the shower rod and hold it against her as Gavroche started pumping his cock into her. "Ahhhh! Yes, Gavroche," she moaned as the hot jet of water struck her clitoris. "Ahhhhh! Oh yes, yes! Oh yes..."</p> <p>Dani's moans were now joined by Gavrochech's as the shower was hitting her clitoris on his cock and as they were both felt their passions and their pleasure mixing on their bodies as they danced along, feeling one each otherness on them. Gav was as one as one as the other as one as they were one as the other a pleasure, and the other the other—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
