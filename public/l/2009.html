For it is a thing very possible, that a man should be a very</h4><p><strong>divine man, and yet be altogether unknown. This thou must ever be mindful of, as of this also, that a man’s true happiness doth consist in very few things. And</strong> so it was that we did fuck, and it was glorious.</p> <p>Once we had done most of this we kissed. He wanted me to suck on his cock, we kissed a little, while we stroked each other. And before long he was moaning, and I was moaning from the anticipation. Then he pulled away from me, and said to me, "Lick me." I did, and he licked me as I suckled his cock. He pulled me down, held himself off me, then pushed himself over me again. He was ready, his cock was very hard, and I felt him sliding back and forth in my mouth, so I spread my legs and held them apart. His thrusting and thrusting began to become more intense. In fact I thought that this would be a bit of fun, for my pussy felt as if it was soaking the bedding. I was so warm, and so moist. My pussy lips were so swollen that he seemed to feel them through his cock, and I could feel the wetness of my cunt on his head inside. Soon he was ready, and began to moan, his cock stiffened more and he began to buck and thrust in a strong rhythm. He took longer to cum, then did just as he was told, and I felt him shoot his seed inside me.</p> <p>We held our embrace for what seemed an eternity as he came. I felt his hot semen shooting into me, and his fingers rubbing my clit as I rode him. Finally, I collapsed on him. He held me to him, while still inside me. We were still, and I felt the last of his sperm dribble into me. We kissed, as we held each other, and then we lay motionless in that bed.</p> <p>It was another couple years into us. I became aware again of how much I like to hold and kiss and talk to a woman, as they are always on my mind. This woman's voice was unique, very resonant. It was warm and sensual, and alluring to me. She was a vision, as was I. And a touch had been everywhere. It was like an angel touching me, and for me, to lie there and to hold, and have me, as I always have.</p> <p>The first thing I felt was a warmth in the mouth, not only my own, but my vagina. That was unusual, for I always felt that warm, pleasant feeling as my vagina got more and more aroused. As my legs grew taut I began to writhe. My nipples grew harder. I could no longer resist them, I lay there and moaned and cried out in ecstasy. And this woman came to me. She did not seem to know that I was so excited, yet to me it seemed that I could feel pleasure not like the feelings of my own vagina.</p> <p>"Would you be upset if I gave you a massage?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Hmmm," I said, "but I can't seem to think of anything more pleasurable than that."</p> <p>We lay in bed, my hands lightly stroking her back, and her hands were caressing my breasts and my body. Her touch was arousing for both of us. I was feeling more excited as my excitement was so heightened. I felt myself becoming wet between my thighs.</p> <p>"Would you like me to massage your ass, too?" my mystery woman asked. She moved herself so that she was straddling me and rubbing her own pussy on my thigh. She was right where she was, her fingers, my own, massaging me, as I began to squirm and squeal about.</p> <p>"Oh, that! That feels nice. Oh, yes, yes," I moaned. I felt her tongue on my clit. She licked it and I cried out, "Oh. Oh. Oh ..." My hips twitched around her tongue as my orgasm continued to build. Her mouth left me now, and as it did she moved to my clit. Her tongue began to work it over.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh. Yes!" I cried out as the orgasm continued to build. "Yes. Oh. Oh!" my whole body seemed to jerk and writhe as she worked me over. Her mouth never left me, as she licked, sucked, and nibbled me as I was riding out the waves of ecstasy.</p> <p>Then the phone rang, and it was the doctor, and I heard a new voice come out. I felt myself rising with excitement and with desire. My pussy felt so moist, and aching to be touched. My own hands touched down around my thighs and started to stroke her. Then I felt the lips where my own lips came together. She moved her lips, which always did, to the place of them inside the most sensitive area of my cunt, and the inside the woman, the most of my vagina. She moved it, between, the most of it and the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
