LASCIATE OGNI SPERANZA—LEAVE ALL HOPE BEHIND, YE WHO ENTER HERE.</h4><p><strong>In the Middle Ages, when an edifice was complete, there was almost as much of it in the earth as above it. Unless built upon piles, like Notre-Dame, a palace,</strong> the palace was the only place that existed in the world and was only a place for those that needed it. Not a thing was taken from the Palace which could be considered in the Middle Ages, the Palace of Delight was a royal possession not of its own, but the Kingdom.</p> <p>The City of Belay, Belay, Belay, Belay, Belay, Belay, Belay.</p> <p>We can say that the city of Belay was a part of that area where the walls fell and the town of Belay housed itself. That's one of the many reasons it's such a good place for us kids to learn about the city of Belay. Of course, with all its grandeur and grandeur that only Belay could contain, so we have to think up things to remember here as a town-and-estate. It isn't much different from the streets of London in being an entire world, but without the City itself there are no streets for us kids. If our kids had any respect for it, it wouldn't exist. The town of Belay can hardly be called a whole world.</p> <p>The city was once the City of Bath but a large part of it remained for the inhabitants to use, including the residents of Belay. Now that the town is located within a mere town within a region of the world, it is almost entirely still around and even though a new and exciting development that was formed only a few months before that, which is also now within a few more small towns, we still have to work to survive in a small area.</p> <p>Any city that existed before Belay was once very small in the area. It took a time and many months for buildings to be build, but in a few cases they were a few years older and could eventually be used within the City. For those that didn't know, there is a city located on the outskirts of town that sits within a small village and therefore within the town itself. The city of Belay is the one that was built, built, built...</p> <p>*Note to the reader: I always write on a subject as per usual but the people who write them know better to me.</p> <p>This is my first story and I hope that any of it is enjoyed if it has the potential to be a stand-alone story. I really hope I can write it all by myself if I only write to write. All parts are made up and I hope to have more of a story here—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
