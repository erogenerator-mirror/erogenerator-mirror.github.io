Some new thing had come into his soul.</strong> He wanted to take a shower and do something, but didn’t have the nerve.</p> <p>To his amazement, she did not wake as he had, but as always, she appeared to be reading, or even lying in the bed next to her, reading. He looked at her sleeping face; the first thoughts he had given him since meeting her was of his desire to have sex with her, but she was the only woman he had ever done anything with. He would wait for them to go back to sleep, never to give her a reason to wake, just to fuck her and come. He would, of course be in love with her, but it would never come between them.</p> <p>After getting some water, he slipped in the shower and scrubbed himself. When he came out of the bathroom, she was sound asleep. There was nothing to do but wait until morning. It was too late for more foreplay, he thought as he dressed and left the bedroom. After putting on a clean shirt and a clean tracky pair of shorts, he went back to Jean Valjean’s bedroom. He sat for a while in silence, watching her body as she slept. His cock started to harden as his mind wandered, wondering what her pussy would taste like and what it would feel like to fuck her. It was too soon for anything but sex, but he knew he had waited for the right opportunity to have some fun with this sexy creature.</p> <p>He opened the door and slipped through it without making a sound. When he got to the end of the bed, he saw her in her morning robe; her legs were spread slightly, inviting him in. He stepped into the room and she stirred. She smiled when she saw him standing there. She moved her legs apart, and he saw the hairless lips of her pussy. Her legs were spread further than usual, exposing her open pussy to his eyes, but it didn't seem to bother him as he stepped closer. When he tried to kiss her there, she pushed his fingers away. He was too embarrassed, not wanting to have sex right then and there without some kind of a romantic ending. Maybe he had the wrong idea when she pushed him away once he began to kiss her pussy; maybe he just wanted to go ahead and do whatever he felt he had to, no matter how dirty it was. She was his first and he'd have done what he did; he would have enjoyed everything she had to offer just as much as she would.</p> <p>With his hands, he spread her lips open, revealing the soft skin of her inner lips. He began to kiss, run his tongue up and down them, causing her to wake, and, if she did not wake, she did have sex with him. He wanted more than sex. He took his erection and rubbed the flesh up and down her pussy. She opened her eyes long enough for him to notice she was having sex, and he saw his cum starting to ooze out of her pussy. He knew she wanted me for sex, he knew of some kind of romantic ending, but had not the nerve to try.</p> <p>She was having sex with me. There was a big difference between me being able to have sex with her and having sex with a woman. He wanted to do everything he had to do to her, and she was having sex with me, if she had no reason to be having sex with me. He put the end of his cock at her pussy, then pressed it up to her hole, entering her slightly, just enough that he took his weight on his knees. She was still asleep, but she didn't look at him like he had raped her right there in the hall. Her arms were over her head, held by her robe, to prevent her exposing herself to him.</p> <p>“What have you been thinking about? Are you trying to make me a liar about some kind of sadism here? Or do you just want to fuck me?” she said in between grunts.” Don’t make me lie to you, baby boy! I am still thinking of you.”</p> <p>She didn’t move, didn’t object to him moving in her, just moved her pussy back towards him. She pushed her face into the carpet, mumbling incoherent sounds.</p> <p>This was as good a time as any. The way she made her body feel, the way she felt about herself, it was better than the last time she talked about her feelings. She had not just been enjoying herself, she had a special feeling about herself as well. He moved his hips back and forth, taking his cock in and out of her pussy without letting up on the motion of his hips. He wanted to make her feel her climax. If he was coming, but, he wanted to feel her orgasm, feel she was getting off. She couldn’d have some kind of a feeling she was coming and then—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
