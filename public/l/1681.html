Mariequita sat near by, dangling her legs, watching him work, and handing</strong> the dour girl an envelope. Mariequita handed the girl her card, too, but it slipped down the curve of her bottom like a diamond drop. It was signed 'Victor: A New Beginning - The Office of the Director' from the name tag, in her left hand. Victor had just taken her from behind, pushing her firmly against the wall of the Gallery, as he held her waist, fucking her hard, her legs wrapped firmly around his waist. When the door to the office unlocked, everyone was gathered in it except Victor, who still held her close. His clothes were off, his dick was inside her, and they were both shuddering with the effort of thrusting into her, their tongues exploring each other.</p> <p>The door opened and Victor closed, and the sound of people filing into the office, were joined by a cry from the secretary. Both were aware of the urgency of Victor's need to have her and of his own need to release himself into his client's eager vagina. There were hands on her ass, a mouth on her breast, and the secretary's hand was at her husband's groin. Victor was still humping, not taking his eyes off the secretary. He'd have liked to see her breasts, but at some moment things would change. There probably wouldn't be any more people in the room than they were now.</p> <p>Victor was not going to let any of the attention that the secretary had been receiving interfere with his orgasm. He didn't care. He had Mariequita in his hands. He was going to take her to the bedroom and fuck her until they both came again. He didn't care whether the secretary might see them, but the idea that she might give in to the urges of the moment, just as Victor had taken her, and that she enjoyed seeing him come with his lover's eyes as one of the directors, if the opportunity arose, was the ultimate reward.</p> <p>His cock jerked as blood rushed to his groin. It was going to be a wonderful evening.</p> <p>It turned out that Mariequita wasn't the secretary. There was always an extra woman in the office. Victor hadn't done it but he had to admit that the office was better than the one in the gallery.</p> <p>The two lovers walked into the office to find their first meeting.</p> <p>Mariequita stood by the glass, gazing out at the gallery while Victor and the other directors strode into the room, then closed the door. Mariequita sat up against the wall, smiling, her body on display, hands gripping her breasts, thighs spread wide for Victor's hard thrusts. Victor reached around Mariequita to hold her against him, his cock rubbing her in a way that she had never imagined, only dreamed. Victor's lips, his tongue, the look in her eyes when he touched her, made Mariequita's nipples harden. She reached out to touch his face, to feel his stubble, to let him look deep inside at her.</p> <p>Mariequita's eyes were closed when the door of the Art Institute opened to find the two of them. The secretary had stepped through the door. With her clothes on, a little wiggle of her tits, and Victor's cock still inside her, the secretary called out, "Victor, what have you done to me? It was beautiful!"</p> <p>Victor didn't say an word. Everything was happening so fast that he was in his own world. His cock jerked as it came alive, then jerked again as it throbbed and spit its seed into Mariequita whose pussy had just been filled. For some reason they had been brought together at the same time, but the act was nothing to be done. Victor didn't care if Mariequita enjoyed it while she felt his come. He was going to do it again and again. And Mariequita wanted it even more than Victor. She hadn't been able to resist. She thought about coming when Victor's cock came deep inside her. That must have felt fantastic. She felt the heat of her own juices as it flooded into her, coating Victor's shaft, her own juices squirting onto her husband's face as he sucked, licked and fucked her. They had the most wonderful evening together she could remember.</p> <p>Mariequita stood, still fully clothed, to help the secretary unbutton her blouse.</p> <p>"I want you to come in my office," she said. "I can't wait until you're back from the office to see if you can make your husband come again, or not."</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Of course you could come, my dear. Of course you would."</p> <p>After being dressed, Mariequita led the secretary into Victor's office and kissed the woman, who they embraced, to the chair, where they embraced, where she sat down on a sofa where they kissed and kissed. The two people, kissed, two men. Kiss and kissingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
