It was about time we were going in this direction.</p> <p>"You'll have to make sure..." I said, with my tongue and my brain for some reason.</p> <p>"I'm not like that, I don't have any of those shoes!" She said, as she crossed and recrossed her legs.</p> <p>"I don't either!"</p> <p>When she stood in front of me, her hips were a perfect target and with my tongue I had the distinct advantage of seeing her panties. I've got a bit of a fetish for panties, and I love to smell a woman's crotch, and to taste her panties. I know that was one of my better fetish features. It always had a special appeal for me.</p> <p>"See anything you like?" I asked, hoping to elicit a response. The answer was that I wanted to taste her panties in return for all the attention they were receiving. I tried to act as natural as possible as I looked down into her dark eyes and asked "Do they taste as good? Is the taste as good as you think?"</p> <p>She was sitting on one of the high, leather high heels next to me in the corner of the shoe bar, and I noticed her long red painted fingernails digging into her toes. I couldn't help but notice her right ankle. She may not have a leg to be called "high," but her feet were something else, especially now. I think that was so beautiful that only women should have them, I think. So she liked to wear high heels, and her feet look so beautiful like they were painted to look good.</p> <p>"You want my feet. Why don't you see how good each pair of shoes tastes?" I asked, as I reached my hands up and rubbed a little of hers hair.</p> <p>"Oh, I can't wait to see you wear each pair. And I'll even let you lick my feet, if you want me to," she said. She was trying to hide a smile from me now as well. I couldn't help but smile too, because of the chance to be the one that had an audience and eat as much of her panties as possible.</p> <p>"I don't know why you were looking at my feet all that much, but then again, we have to do this a little differently from all the other people in the shoe bar. And don't you think we can keep our panties private, too?" I said, as I put my hand against her knee to try to feel her leg.</p> <p>"Are you trying to get into my panties? Are you seriously trying to get into my panties? It's not funny," she said, trying to fight back a laugh.</p> <p>"Of course it's not funny, Gretel." I said, as I kissed her foot, which were slightly on her left side. I kissed the shoe bar on her lower right knee, and she started to squirm a little. "Stop it," she said, as I kissed her ankle and pulled her foot further into my mouth.</p> <p>"I won't let you get away with this," she said, as she tried to push me away. I kept kissing it, kissing all along her foot, and making sure the skin of the bottom of her foot was very shiny.</p> <p>"This is really bad," she said, as she kicked me away again. "Look at me."</p> <p>"You know I don't have any panties on under those red and purple heels," I said.</p> <p>"Well, you're going to have to go shopping tomorrow, and you do want to wear those high heels," she said, as she sat down and tried to hide her smile.</p> <p>Now she couldn't deny it as she looked me up and down with a sly smile on her face. "Let's go to see the store, then," she said, as she gave my semi erect penis a slight squeeze with her hand.</p> <p>I smiled back at her. It was a lot like the time when I was standing in the store with her and I was getting hard for her. She was really giving me a little workout, and I was hoping that maybe we both could have some fun.</p> <p>She helped me up, and I could feel her nipples were getting harder with the excitement of her teasing my dick with her foot. Of course she also knew what I like to see, and I made sure to turn out my lights on the rest of the shelves.</p> <p>screen a little bit to avoid everyone at the left. screen.
