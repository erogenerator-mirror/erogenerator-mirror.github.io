When she was half a dozen years younger, Louisa had been overheard to begin a conversation with her brother one</strong> time.</p> <p>"Soooo I see you still have the hots for Louisa, you dirty fucker."</p> <p>She thought, maybe I was already in love with her, but not like I was with this sexy woman.</p> <p>Her lips went up on one side, like they should not have left the other. "I love you." Was all that her lips said. She kissed her on her cheek, and she kissed her way to the other cheek.</p> <p>"Come here!"</p> <p>She was kneeling next to him. Her hand reached for his cock.</p> <p>"I have a surprise for you."</p> <p>The sound of footsteps echoed into her ear. He was looking at her, smiling.</p> <p>"Well well I see you're awake, love."</p> <p>"Why hello Louisa," he said, grabbing my hair. "I always get this reaction."</p> <p>"I could have had more time." She said, grinning.</p> <p>"Don't get off to it."</p> <p>He pulled her to him, kissing her before saying "Now what?" before entering her with his fingers in her pussy.</p> <p>He pulled out, his cock dripping from its own cum.</p> <p>She put down her glass of wine before looking at it. "I think you'll need a drink too sweetheart. And I can't seem to get enough of your cock. It's a great kisser, isn't it?"</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"You want to do this again, don't you?"</p> <p>She nodded, and he pulled her up. Their kisses grew more passionate the longer they took. Each touch of his lips made her moan into his mouth. His cock rubbed against her pussy before entering her. This time, it didn't hurt as much as the first time. His kisses lingered for her, before he pulled out as she said "I'm sorry. I can't feel you in me so bad. What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Why is it always so good with me?" he replied as his cock returned to her pussy.</p> <p>Her hand caressed his. "You don't get this much pleasure from the way you use your hands on my breasts?"</p> <p>"Not like Louisa?"</p> <p>She nodded. "No. I mean I got you a little bonus from this."</p> <p>He caressed her breasts with his hands, feeling her nipples and their hard peaks. She felt like she was wearing nothing but a smile. She pulled his hand out, and she ran the finger-tips of her palm over his balls. They ached. "Is it too hard to stay in here?" Her finger grazed his opening. "No, it's just... not that big..."</p> <p>She rubbed his cock in her palm, letting him feel the warm friction of her touch.</p> <p>"Does it feel that good, do you like to come inside me?"</p> <p>"It's a big surprise, babe. I haven't ever done that with anyone. You're so sexy Louisa... I just... can't describe."</p> <p>He took his finger out, and his cock, glistening with her pussy juices, poked a way out. He put his finger in her mouth, tasting his own cum. "What's wrong, darling? Are you uncomfortable or something?"</p> <p>She kissed him back. "Hmmm... let's just say I could just as well if you liked it. It's so good, and you taste so good!"</p> <p>His eyes were on fire and filled with lust. "Then just let me do this, if you're too scared to fuck me." His voice was hoarse and urgent.</p> <p>She wrapped her lips around his head, taking just an inch of him into her mouth. Then he stopped, almost as if he were afraid about how she would react at first. She stopped, her lips closed, sucking a little more before opening them again.</p> <p>"Please," he whispered. "Don't stop."</p> <p>He began moving his cock into her mouth and letting it slide between her lips. It was as if they'd been fucking since they began kissing.</p> <p>She loved the way this was going. She loved the way he kept saying, I love it, so fucking good, I love you, I love you, when you say, fuck me..." With his hips moving in her mouth, she could feel him swelling, and her pussy began pulsing. "Don't stop...please don't stop..."</p> <p>She closed around him, sucking on him, feeling him start pumping hard towards her tongue. She pulled away, only to lick her lips, tasting herself on them.</p> <p></p> <p>"I'm coming, darling," he moaned the sex. He sighed.</p> <p></p> <p>She started thrust his cock in her mouth.</p> <p>"Come.</p> <p>Come...it's yours, lover</p> <p></p> <p>come, lover</p> <p>He wasâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
