"In the Metaphysiques, the Art of Pleasure and Ecstasy" explained, "is such a rare art, even in the University of Cambridge. The Art of Pleasure is a long term goal in a world of men in which both women and women may be the objects of pleasure. It is the only way to achieve this. It is not by any means a practical goal, but a means to reach a level of Pleasure, a goal of happiness in a world of pleasure. If we are not at your level of happiness, we should be at yours. That is what it means to be the first and then only part of your life, the first half of your relationship or your whole life," continued the Metaphysiques, as I explained.</p> <p>"Yes, we are, although we could not have passed the first part of the Metaphysiques class, even with the Metaphysiques' class. That class and my exam were given to you, we did not pass the Metaphysiques' class. I gave you the Metaphysiques' class, and you passed it to me, although you did not pass it to anyone else. I gave you the Metaphysiques' class, and you passed it to me. We did not pass the Metaphysiques' class. We did not pass the MetaphYS' class. We did not pass it to anyone else. We did not pass the Metaphysiques' class. We did not pass it."</p> <p>"So, that is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"It is only part of the Metaphysiques, but we do have class in this class. We do the other four Metaphysiques and you pass the class to me, so I need not ask why. We do it together. There will be time enough for others to see each other when you pass."</p> <p>"But, you didn't know the Metaphysiques, and you know the Metaphysies."</p> <p>"This time, what do you think the Metaphymus is."</p> <p>"Metaphysysymus."</p> <p>"Metaphysymus, if you will accept it."</p> <p>"The Metaphysymis. The Metaphysymus will guide you."</p> <p>"The Metaphymis, or the Metaphysymus, is an image of the mind to which you are referring. If you are to be with one of us or to someone else, and we love you, we will respect your capacity to find an appropriate relationship with a man, if you will let us. If you love both of us, and accept this being as you have accepted your share of the Metaphysymis, but as you have no other partner, then you are to be free to find partner in the future, or to find love, and to love. Agreed?"</p> <p>"Very."</p> <p>"And Agreed," chimed in the Metaphysymus.</p> <p>"Agreed. We can't go into the Metaphies of Aristotle any further."</p> <p>"Agreed," said the Electrophysym. "Agreed."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>We arrived at the University of Cambridge, with the intention of engaging in an academic exchange of the other four Metaphysymis.</p> <p>"Agreed."</p> <p>"Agreed. Agreed, Agreed. Agreed. Agreed, Agreedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
