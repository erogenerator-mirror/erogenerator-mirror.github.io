M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXIX. An Epoch in Anne’s Life</h4><p><strong>ANNE was bringing the cows home from the back pasture by way of Lover’s Lane. It was a September evening and all the gaps and clearings in the woods were</strong> now open. We had been watching one episode of Friends on-line at times and were pretty keen to get this particular episode right. We kept thinking of all of the interesting things to do before going our separate ways. Of course I thought that was a really great idea as we would miss our fun and adventure. Now it was a good four days to be home with family, the weather was warm and the cows were all settled in.</p> <p>We parked the car in our spare bedroom and went into the front door. I had planned to cook breakfast for everyone but when we arrived home we just started a little late. We found our bedroom was pretty empty. We just checked on the door handle and sure enough, it was cracked. I tried to tell Amy’s parents but they would never hear us but they were out and it was already dark before we even got in the bed. That little adventure made it a bit more awkward for me. My face was in her crotch and I started to suck her tits but she pushed me away. She said that it would be no fun and that we needed to go back downstairs. It was dark.</p> <p>I couldn’t be sure but Amy had her shorts and panties back on. She said this was the only time that we could get a decent view of the place and didn’t want to embarrass her by getting aroused. My dick was still hard. As we climbed into bed I put my arm around Amy but instead of sliding my hand down between her legs she pulled my hand on to her breast. It wasn’t too terrible though. It was warm so we would be naked later but for the sake of this night I decided to continue to play outside. We kissed while our fingers continued to stroke. I played with her nipple first and then with both hands. Then I played with her pussy lips and that got both of us hot. I inserted three fingers into her pussy while Amy sucked on my other man’s tongue. The next thing that happened after a few minutes was I pushed Amy’s shorts and panties to the floor. She just had a thin landing strip of pubic hair above her pussy. Now it was my turn to tease. I put her on her back and spread her legs apart. I had never seen a hairless pussy before. There were a few hairs in the way of my fingers but they were all gone and I went straight for her clit. The first time I touched her clitoris was when she had a little orgasm at the last second. She let out a deep breath and pushed my hand out of the way as I started sucking her clit. She was right on the edge. Amy started to scream and I felt her stomach tensing up as she had another huge orgasm. I could feel the sweat starting to get all over the place as her orgasm ripped her body. Her juices were starting to run down to catch all that fresh nectar in a bucket of ice cubes.</p> <p>I was exhausted and just kept sucking her clit and pussy like a child trying to pull the ice cubes into my mouth. She started to breathe again. She looked straight down at me. “My clit!” she breathed. “It’s beautiful.”</p> <p>I felt like I was in a dream but I sure wasn’t. I had never touched a woman’s clit before and didn’t think it might actually happen. Her body started to tremble and she started to shake. The first wave had a lot of her first to arrive followed by a few of the second. When it was her turn again they really came together. Her body had shuddered some too and I couldn’t believe I was looking closely at my fingers touching her pussy lips and my thumb slipping into the opening. Amy’s breathing was getting heavier now as I kept fingering her pussy. When her stomach started to settle down and her back started to arch she finally stopped shaking and gave up shaking. She pulled my fingers out of her pussy and grabbed my hands. “We can keep playing if you don’t mind!” She said.</p> <p>“No problem!” I responded.</p> <p>“Don’t say anything until I say you can.” She giggled.</p> <p>We started to take our clothes off and she took hers off to join the festivities. That first scene made me hot and I felt my dick getting harder because of her touching me this way. I started to make my way from the bedroom to the den where I found the bottle of sherry I had had earlier bought. It was full of some sherry that I had bought from the local. I had been saving. The Best, I felt like some good for this afternoon. I had the evening. I felt the good but I had been in that afternoon. She had only. Amy had this. In the best. She had—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
