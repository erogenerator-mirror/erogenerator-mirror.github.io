G. Wells </h3><h4>Time Travelling</h4><p><strong>“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is now, a</strong> big, white dick just to your right, just barely in front of you, and you can see me in all my glory when I get you excited.”</p> <p>That’s what happens when you get aroused. When you are excited enough, when you are on top, it’s time for more sex!</p> <p>So, I took a bath. I shaved my face, chest, and arms and legs, leaving myself quite clean and ready to get any dick my brain could come to hold. I showered, put on a little blue bikini and put on the top with a string tied behind my back before putting on the bottoms with a little blue bow. After the look that I got at the fashion show, I could hardly wait for that day when my body would match the length of my dick.</p> <p></p> <p>Just to be clear: this fantasy story is a work of fiction. None of the characters in it ever happened.</p> <p>© 2006, All rights reserved.</p> <p>My husband is away for the weekend and my daughter is in school with her friends, so this fantasy is pure fantasy. All of my sexual fantasies have a lot of implications. Some of them are just like every fantasy that's been made since I created the thing, others are erotic ones. Most of the sexual fantasies I’m exploring today are all true and not based on this fantasy - you’re imagining. Most of the sexual fantasy that these modern times are about is a fantasy of mine, not some other one that I’ve tried to play with a little bit.</p> <p>So, there I was, looking forward to getting my ass and pussy hammered by that big black dick of his, while sitting here on my patio table, masturbating while imagining his hand reaching to my cunt and reaching for my tits - maybe his mouth sucking and pinching on my nipple while pumping his cock in and out of my mouth as I sucked on his big dick. I was a horny slut in heat now, thinking about being stretched out on my patio table while he plowed my pussy and was squeezing my tits and playing with them too. If my fantasy fantasy ended with me getting pounded by his big black dick, it could have been more than one day ahead. This fantasy has been one part fantasy for me to be a little naughty. Now, I had two main parts to play out for real.</p> <p>One part was that I was being made to get my pussy pounded by a big, thick, black dick. The other part was my fantasy playing out in my own home, where we got a room to ourselves.</p> <p>So, we did our fantasy on our patio table.</p> <p>I think every husband has one fantasy. It's about getting his dick sucked before he fucks me. I just can’t get enough of it. Every once and a while, every once and a while in our home, when I’m horny (or even frustrated), and this fantasy will get my cunt dripping wet, he’ll bend me over on our patio table and pound me until I cry in pleasure. That’s what I told myself to tell my husband right then and there. I just can’t do that. I can’t tell him what I’m thinking or feeling. It’s my fantasy.</p> <p>I sat there, with my arms in my lap, my tits standing up, my nipples hard and stiff. My pussy was really wet right now, the swollen lips of my swollen pussy lips were aching to be touched but not being able to. My nipples stood and throbbed against my bikini top and bra. My pussy lips were open and wet and swollen and pink. I knew it was wrong, but I could not control the lust that had risen up inside of me. I’m always turned on by the image of the big black man fucking my wife, fucking my wife’s cunt and ass while her husband looks on. My fantasy ended like this.</p> <p>That was when my husband came home from work after school. As he usually did, he went straight to his office and locked himself in. I stayed there, sitting on my patio table with my elbows on the table. This fantasy took him an entire afternoon to fuck. He would get on my patio table, lift a leg to the edge, rub his huge cock up and down my cunt and into my body, and fuck me until he came all over my face, neck, and shoulders.</p> <p>When it was over, he would take his dick out, turn me around, and fuck my wet pussy until the next time he took a vacation and fucked me in the bathtub. I’m ashamed to say it, but my fantasy ends with me, too.</p> <p></p> <p>In some of things I have done to the truth, some of them I wrote or not</p> <p></p> <p>In some of which I may the fact that happen</p> <p>< or—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
