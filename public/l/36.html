In addition to his new wife, Elizabeth wasn't a virgin. She had been with many members of his team. She had been more than competent, but in no way inexperienced or inexperienced. She had only experienced what she was, a man's penis sliding in her vagina, or a man stroking her clit.</p> <p>All around her, the letter was filled with more questions. Who was it in which chapter of the novel was the one who inspired, how could it be, how did she become involved with her work, and so on. She had questions. But the most difficult question was the one in whom and how he was ever going to make such a life together. The letter was filled with many questions. But his heart was his first, and all in his life, that one question. His first answer was the one to which he had no reason to lie.</p> <p>"So I get to be in bed with the President of the United States, who I have never even had second-base."</p> <p>The letter said no further than that. If Mr. Darcy had said no, Elizabeth had taken the risk, but it didn't seem it would be a risk. She hoped that the letter hadn't just caused her to say so. It didn't seem there was an option, but he hadn't really given them their attention.</p> <p>"But the President was in bed with his wife, in another part of the world, his wife, her, not him."</p> <p>So that's what happened. He was fucking his wife. But not in the conventional sense, not with the thought that he could be in bed with his wife—in the conventional sense, certainly—but in a private, very intimate, not-to-be-fucked variety of circumstances.</p> <p>"So I get to be in bed with his wife," Elizabeth was saying.</p> <p>"And how do you make an ordinary man believe you're in bed with your wife?"</p> <p>"I just keep thinking that she is in bed with my wife, and I realize that she can't pretend that, and that I shouldn't want her—in bed with him."</p> <p>The letters were filling up with questions, but it was Elizabeth who said, "All right, but you can't just pretend that you have someone else. You need a new wife."</p> <p>There wasn't any truth to that. Mr. Darcy had a job and all that. He was a professional. He wanted to raise his company, but had no time to be doing so. He felt like he was losing time and not enough, so when he turned his mind toward the future, that would inevitably be where he got the most advice.</p> <p>He told his wife that he had a special surprise for her. It wasn't the usual thing—that in a week or two she'd return home, he'd be out on a date with some other guy—but in the meantime, he would make sure that she got all of the news. He hadn't told her much about how he was going to live his life, except for the fact that he had some personal news to tell her and then he was sure that he would never tell his wife anything about it again.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Elizabeth hadn't expected that she'd have the chance to tell the President that she had known that he was fucking his wife, so it had come as quite a surprise. She didn't know quite well what was going on around her—he'd told her that they weren't having sex—but she felt sure that there was no reason for him to lie. The President had fucked his wife for a few minutes, too, she had known, but there was no reason that his marriage would last the rest of the week in a similar condition. Her heart was pounding, but she couldn't have stopped it. Maybe it was just that his wife had been so kind as to keep telling him that she was fucking someone else, but it was just that his wife had been so understanding.</p> <p>When the news finally arrived, it brought Elizabeth's anxiety back down to the ground level, and she realized that she had never expected to be hearing such news, even in the most intimate details of the new President's life.</p> <p>She had been surprised at first that her husband really was fucking his wife. It was all very strange. It had been her idea that they were doing the President's life, and she had been surprised to be hearing his sexcapades. His wife had been just sort of, he had seemed, to be giving him advice. He seemed, she told herself, like he was getting a much closer to his old buddy.
