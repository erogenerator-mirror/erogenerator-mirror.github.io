A second man with a hand inside her pink panties and his other hand on her big tits.</p> <p>The day had ended.</p> <p>Then, for the first time in his life, he had thought about fucking some woman before. Maybe one in particular. Maybe even the next time he made an enemy by fucking her he could take her in the ass just by her pussy. Or maybe a woman that he hadn't been given a chance to experience in such a short time just like the first time he had seduced a woman. Maybe even the first time he had had a double-dildo up his ass when he had met his friend for a beer, a dildo that he had fucked in his asshole and again in the ass—and who he was fucking again the second time around—before he had taken the dildo from her pussy and made it his bitch. He wondered how he would feel about the first fuck, what he would think about the second, what he would do after the second fuck.</p> <p>But he didn't give a shit. He just fucked and then he fucked and took it. He just fucked and took it a while longer before the fucking began again. Or maybe he had been with women before too much longer and now he wanted to fuck and take it and ride it again as soon as he could.</p> <p>So he fucked, then fucked, then fucked again and again that day. He fucked and took it. Then he took a dildo up his ass whenever he could just to get the dildo to work and fuck and fuck until he could take it no longer and he'd be out of his bed for good. Once his cock began to recover from being fucked so long he decided to go back up there.</p> <p>And he fucked again.</p> <p>And again and again—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
