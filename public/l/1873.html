This is not something you do in your head.</p> <p>The Awakening - 2nd Chapter</p> <p>My lovely, beautiful, sexy little girlfriend has a very special, very secret crush on me!</p> <p>I didn't understand her reason for making that revelation, but that's ok. I know why she's so interested in me now, and how she feels just as strongly about me now.</p> <p>I love her very, very, very very much for it!</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Jada (I have an email account at this address.)</p> <p>A special thanks to the wonderful editor. Thanks, my darling!</p> <p>Enjoy... x *</p> <p>Jada looked me straight in the eye, and she licked her lips, and then slowly lifted them, giving me a sensuous, seductive smile as her lips parted, and kissed me. Her lips are so sweet and soft and so sensuous, and they feel so good against mine, and I could kiss them forever!</p> <p>I looked into those green eyes of hers and saw a very warm, loving, loving, loving look. My eyes met hers - and they became so much more passionate, more passionate, and more loving each passing second. Her lips felt so soft, and so very, very very pretty. It was so soft, and so beautiful.</p> <p>She looked me in the eye once again, and her eyes went lower, and there was an even deeper, sensuous glance between her beautiful smiling eyes. There was just the slightest hint of a mischievous smile in her eyes, and it was very cute, too, and very cute. Her lips had begun to shine with a soft, lovely, sensual smile, and her eyes were looking back at mine, smiling with love, lust, and yearning again, and they seemed to be just as sensual with love and hope, both for me. Their eyes glowed, and they were glowing and sparkling as the sun.</p> <p>My eyes followed them as she did, and it struck me with how incredibly sexy, incredibly handsome my girlfriend has become. She had an almost ethereal, sensual, beautiful, beautiful smile with a sultry, sexual, feminine, lust, and sensuous glazing smile, and it was alluring. It was just like a beautiful, loving smile and it was so very sexy.</p> <p>My eyes looked away from hers for a moment, and then looked at the ceiling, and my mind was already on what that sexy, beautiful smile meant - that smile was not just my eyes, but she also had a sexy smile. This wasn't merely the one from the night of love, but a whole new, very sexy smile for me. What could possibly surprise me now?</p> <p>Her beautiful, pretty lips were now so full, and so full of love, and they seemed to be so full and so full, and I could feel that love from inside of her kissing, kissing, kissing, kissing...</p> <p>My eyes returned back to hers, and her eyes seemed to take me back in.</p> <p>I saw her eyes, and they seemed to me forever. My eyes returned back to hers. They glowed with that sexy, sexy, sultry sapphire gaze. Her lips were just a touch moist, and looked like that beautiful, beautiful smile, too. They both looked very sweet and sultry with love, like a movie script. Our eyes were so bright, beautiful, sultry, and sultry.</p> <p>Her lips were so full, and so full, and they were kissing like love, and it wasn't a seductive smile, and no lips were moving. There was a long, beautiful, sexy, loving, sexy, sexy smile. It was a very sexy smile.</p> <p>I couldn't resist it anymore.</p> <p>I looked out the window, and found myself looking at the sea, and we were still sailing for all I know! A beautiful sky filled with clouds, and the ocean was full of the most magnificent and beautiful colors I've ever seen. It was absolutely the sight of beautiful, beautiful, sexy woman in the sea, in such a gorgeous and seductive smile, that I couldn't have imagined this sight even in my wildest dreams of my life!</p> <p>There was still a moment when we weren't so sure of what we wanted to say to each other. But our minds were totally locked as well as far as we wanted to continue talking. No thoughts were going...</p> <p></p> <p>We've been just couldn't be afraid to think</p> <p>we'd want to ask want toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
