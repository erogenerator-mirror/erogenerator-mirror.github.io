English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XXXV. The Sublime Ones.</h4><p><strong>These belong to a type which Nietzsche did not altogether dislike, but which he would fain have rendered more subtle and plastic. It is the type that takes life and</strong> makes it a good time to be fucked.</p> <p>So there I was sitting on the train car in Chicago, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, listening to the sound of a saxophone, when a man and a saxophone came onto the train car, taking its place beside me, and I got off the train.</p> <p>The saxophone soloists, while singing the song, "Love Is An Indulgence", were in my car, and the saxophone soloists were singing, "This is the feeling that can only only happen in the bedroom".</p> <p>I had spent the first ten minutes of my trip, enjoying having sex with women whom would do anything for me. I could hardly believe that such a wonderful, lovely, thoughtful woman was my neighbor, my lover, and my buddy and who I would go down on to pleasure her every day of her life.</p> <p>"This," I said to myself, as I got off one of the train cars, "is the sound of love."</p> <p>What a fantastic time that had been. I had met my love for music in a movie theater in Atlanta where they held the opera. I was in the audience of the first of the most popular opera. After the show, I was walking to a car, holding the car door open, and a man and woman walked from the theater into the theater.</p> <p>I loved all the things music did to someone in love. I liked seeing people go through this.</p> <p>"Love, this music, this love," I thought to myself as I walked to the car, "Is the sound of love."</p> <p>"This is the love of love", I thought to myself.</p> <p>The woman in the car in Atlanta took her seat without being asked.</p> <p>I kissed her.</p> <p>"I love this music", I thought to myself.</p> <p>My mind wandered as I took me to my date with a woman by the name of Sarah.</p> <p>"Love" was the name of this woman. She was young, beautiful, and quite beautiful. She had perfect breasts; I couldn't resist touching them and kissing them.</p> <p>She wore a white blouse and black skirt while she had a white blouse showing her sexy legs. My date, a young guy, was on the other side of being shown to the car seat.</p> <p>I was kissing her and kissing her all over her, but she held up the car door like a baby and we got in the car and she closed the door.</p> <p>"Come on" she said, "We won't need our date."</p> <p>"Love" I thought to myself, "This is love!"</p> <p>I turned on the radio and played my favorite music when she kissed me and let me suck her breasts, which I had never seen before.</p> <p>"Ah," I thought, "We have this together; this is love"</p> <p>I kissed her some more. We were kissing and kissing while she held the car door open for my date.</p> <p>My date walked in, kissed me and then kissed me again, some more passionately this time.</p> <p>"We won't need our date now", I thought, "This is love".</p> <p>"Lose a box of your clothes first", she said, "There are no strings attached", and she removed her clothes for the first time that evening.</p> <p>"Oh", I thought, "Oh what do I have to do to be loved this much"?</p> <p>She told me her name and that she would go to her apartment and put on clothes for her date. As I got myself into bed I thought, "God, I feel as if I'm going to be fucked by this woman."</p> <p>She looked alluring, but I was thinking of her in the darkness of Atlanta in the summer of 1968 when I thought we may be on the same page in love, and what a wonderful lady I was having the time of my life with this beautiful woman.</p> <p>I didn't know that, but I did know that, when you have sex with the love of a beautiful woman, you must do everything in your power to have the right of return, and to have a way to return on the right of return in the spirit of love.</p> <p>I was thinking, "Here, let me get the right thing."</p> <p>The lady in Atlanta had just arrived and was waiting with the lights off. She had put on her blouse as I said, "This", and she had removed her blouse and had removed her bra.</p> <p>She turned and looked at me, "We better get some sleep. I want sex before sleep."</p> <p>I looked at her, "This is the wrong thing", but love, isn't there's love", and we can't a wrong, this is good, my love, "Love I thought to say.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>love, love, love love loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
