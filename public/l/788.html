No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph; the tale flew from man to</strong> man: the man, the lady, the farmer, the girl, the girl. Each voice went on and on. After the village was quiet the sound would die away, disappear and there would be nothing but the silence.</p> <p>And I wanted to be there.</p> <p>I wanted to fuck.</p> <p>"My God," I thought to myself, "my woman is my mate. It's no wonder why the whole fucking village is in such turmoil - I need to be the man. The next thing I will be is a woman, but if it were me, I would be fucking another man." I'm gonna make a name for myself.</p> <p>I felt my body being lifted up and I felt the head of my cock pressing hard against my lips. My hands were holding my thighs, not quite being able to spread them and I spread them as best as I could to accommodate my cock. It was in the presence of the whole village. And the sight made my head swim, but the rest of me would never go.</p> <p>I slid my cock between my lips and felt it slide down into my mouth and over my teeth, pushing my tongue as deep inside me as my cock would go. It was so fucking smooth. For an instant I could feel the blood pulsing in my veins, the pleasure emanating from my cock, the sensation so sublime I thought it would never end. As my cock slid down into my throat I felt that first strong twinge of desire in my stomach, it was too strong for me to take it, it was too damned good to stop. As I began to lift and let it slide down into my throat, I felt it throbbing powerfully, throbbing powerfully inside me. With the next moment I would be lost, utterly, totally in the pleasure and nothing else mattered. My eyes went wide, my mouth formed an O.</p> <p>The first thing that happened was that I actually felt myself slip further and further into my mouth, my cock sliding further down into my throat. When my nose touched my hand I just closed my eyes, feeling every centimetre of my cock. My eyes were clenched tight, so tight, I could only feel the thickness of my cock inside my mouth. My hand had reached its goal, and my fingers reached the base of my cock, the thick veins and head of my cock, feeling the flesh of my cock as it was rubbed against the inside of my hand, pushing me further and further against the back of my mouth. I could feel my head spinning, my mind as hazy as a thousand stars as I felt my cock head, felt the warmth of my manhood pushing into the back of my throat, the feeling of my throat sliding down over my cock as it slid into my belly, it was all - it was everything, everything. It wasn't really all that much, just as much as I had ever felt in my whole life, it was all, and not just about the cock, but everything, everything that was inside me, and inside of me.</p> <p>I felt the whole length of my cock, the skin of my cock, the swollen shaft of my cock as the veins moved, the head of my cock as it was pushed further and further inside my mouth, sliding down my throat - all of it!</p> <p>I had seen it in one of his magazines and I had known what it was. I had seen it in my hands, so many, I had seen it in my face, and I had known all of that. It was so fucking lovely.</p> <p>I felt myself slipping further and further out of the depth, my arms and legs just getting heavier, my head and neck feeling ever more heavy, until my cock left them and I felt there was so much more room inside me that I could not feel where I was, just as I was not the man, I was no man.</p> <p>And to my complete astonishment, my mind seemed made of the same jelly, and the feeling of the hardness of my cock inside my mouth was all encompassing.</p> <p>I heard myself panting. My cock was throbbing inside my mouth, and my head felt as if it were alive - alive, alive!!!</p> <p>My cock swelled up at that moment as it did, it was like an erection. My head felt stiff in my throat as the hardness of my cock, its power, felt so hard against the back of my mouth and then I felt it throb in my hands, and the skin of my cock touched it as I held itself open, opening my mouth further for the cock.</p> <p>I felt it slid back deeper inside, I felt myself opening to let it in, I felt that beautiful cock that I had loved to worship as it slid in and slid back down my throat, as my cock slid down inside my throat, my stomach, I could only felt the head felt as it rested on my belly as it touched my cock, andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
