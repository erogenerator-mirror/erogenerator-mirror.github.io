In so doing, he had to make himself an Agent so he could be a better version of himself and feel like a part of the world, an 'ancient knight' without a blade.</p> <p>A bit too much information, he thought.</p> <p>No more time, no more time to talk. Just sex.</p> <p>He didn't have to wait long, for, if he wanted to enjoy the time, he had to experience the world. He had to feel good again. But, for the moment, he could wait.</p> <p>There would be time then. He knew it. It had to happen.</p> <p>But, he had to make it right, somehow. For there would not be the slightest bit of awkwardness. He had to do it right.</p> <p>He had to make it good.</p> <p>His fingers slid into his pants, his cock began to pulse, pulsate as the blood flooded his veins, his stomach tightened, muscles contracted, the muscles within his cock tightened, his body shuddered, every nerve in his body screamed with ecstasy.</p> <p>He stroked himself, his mind whirled, his body writhed, his eyes rolled back, his mind lost in the sensations of his cock, his mind, the universe, his whole existence, his being, it could all be the release, the sensation that was all that a man could hope to achieve, each second, each second, each instant.</p> <p>He had to make it good.</p> <p>He gripped his cock tighter, his hand, his fist, the other hand, he held his erect cock tightly as it throbbed, throbbed, pulsated, it pulsated, hard and throbbing under his stroking hand, his thumb touching the glans, the ridge, the head, the frenulum as the head, his cock, he stroked it with a steady, relentless rhythm.</p> <p>His thumb, it caressed the smooth ridge of the glans, the sensitive underside of the head, the smooth head that he called his cock. It caressed his foreskin, his foreskin, his cock. The soft ridge of his cock, the smooth, silky soft, smooth head that he called his cock. As he stroked himself, his fingers, he reached inside himself, one finger lightly flicked the slit, a slight, barely perceptible touch that was as if he had touched a warm, firm tongue. And, there, he rubbed, he rubbed gently, he stroked, he stroked, he stroked, there. The smooth, soft flesh felt, it felt like a tight, warm, moist, soft glove, and, he could feel the heat of his hand, it rubbed his cock, it rubbed his foreskin, it, it rubbed him.</p> <p>In the throes of the climax, his finger slid between, the smooth skin moved, it slid, his foreskin slid, like silk, it slid, it slid, and it slid, the skin slid, felt the sensation, the sensation of the motion, the hardness of his finger sliding between the smooth, soft flesh of his cock, in the silky-softness of his foreskin. The softness was different. His cock was different.</p> <p>His orgasm started out as an involuntary, involuntary shudder of pleasure. He felt warmth of his ejaculation, like a warm, strong current, of which he had never been able to describe. The feeling, this sensation of heat, of heat, of warmth that he could not describe, the feeling of his cock, of his cum, of his cum, of his cum, cum, of his cum, the feelings, the sensations; the feeling of warm, wet, slippery, liquid, liquid, like his own hand, the wetness of his own semenâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
