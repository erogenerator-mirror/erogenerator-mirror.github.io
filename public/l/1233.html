FAUCHELEVENT SHOULD HAVE ENTERED WITH SOMETHING UNDER HIS ARM</h4><p><strong>Cosette and Marius beheld each other once more. What that interview was like we decline to say. There are things which one must not attempt to depict; the sun is</strong> always warm. Oh the beauty of man...what a day!</p> <p>The sun has already risen in the day. It's rising in the evening. We stand in the warm darkness and bask in the stars. We stand and bask in the warmth of this beautiful day.</p> <p>It was a long time ago and yet never more. The time is as of an hour and yet is so much longer. What did it mean to me and how would I react in the days to come? I cannot answer yet in these long moments.</p> <p>I stood to one side of you and the sun. Your soft hands wrapped around me while I felt you against me. When the sun came the lights seemed to come brighter in the darkness. I was naked from the waist downwards. I felt so vulnerable and exposed, you touching me like you touched other people when you touched me. I felt embarrassed I'm standing before a beautiful man but I felt so wanted. I felt desire for you.</p> <p>I could not tell you how much this had made me feel during my time since being with you. We made love with each other. Our eyes closed and I opened for you my lips sliding against yours. Your mouth opened and our kisses began and ended. I felt the kiss intensify like I felt at your first time with a lover. I felt your hand on the back of my neck. Your lips moving down towards me while your hand slid to the front of my breasts. That first time with my husband of 20 years was a mistake and a wonderful experience. Yet now it was the memory of your love that made it possible but we never could have the relationship we have before. I always felt ashamed that I could not be with you in that way and then when I touched you in that way my guilt would be too strong for a man.</p> <p>You feel my body against yours while your hand moved to my thighs. You felt my heat. You are touching me there now.</p> <p>Our kisses grew more passionate. Your palm caressed my buttocks. Your lips kissed my pussy. Your lips slid and parted my lips and my clitoris. You took my clitoris into your mouth and caressed it with your tongue while my clitoris became aroused and throbbed in your mouth.</p> <p>I feel you slide yourself against me, sliding your cock along my pussy, feeling how hard it is. As your cock touched my clitoris I felt you inside of me.</p> <p>I feel you take me with you. We can feel how I feel inside you.</p> <p>My hands reached towards you. Their touch and the warmth of you made me so wet in my middle room. I was not ashamed nor ashamed of it. I felt that if you and I were going to fuck we have to be careful no one else is going to disturb us. I felt safe but in the darkness I felt unsure how I should have felt during your time while we were separated in the night. It has been so long.</p> <p>You moved your fingers to my nipples and squeezed as I felt I could not stand the pleasure of your touch. It took me by surprise not to feel it but I did.</p> <p>We stood and I felt you take me towards the darkness. Then we reached the darkness. Your hand left my waist to find your lips again. You kissed my mouth and licked my lips and my cheek before placing your head on my chest. You kissed me before you started fucking me again.</p> <p>I felt you slip your cock inside me. I was so wet. Your penis was huge inside me. It pushed against my clitoris but my clitoris stayed outside of my body. I love the feeling of power, freedom and freedom and all this with a man. You are so kind and loving.</p> <p>It is what I felt in the darkness now. You fucked me again, harder than I have ever been fucked. I felt so strong like a butterfly and when I felt your weight against me your body was on top of me. You took me and your penis inside again and inside again. I loved myself now, the darkness again.</p> <p>You hold my breasts and I feel strong yet tender. You're like sweet soft kisses and you kissed me with your body. I enjoyed the sensation. The thrill you made me feel.</p> <p>You were so gentle. So sweet. Not angry angry hard, but gentle. It was like you did it with your tongue. The excitement of your mouth making me feel like a butterfly with you. The pleasure you created with your mouth is so much different from what you usually do.</p> <p>I felt our breathing. Our moans of pleasure. I loved the feeling of our fucking.</p> <p>You are a lover and you always have been.< you kissed me with the right after you have had touched me the first.< You said.
