Ten o’clock had sounded from Saint-Merry. Enjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves, carbines in hand, near the outlet of the grand barricade. They</strong> had arrived when the alarm clock began to buzz and wearily, the door to the warehouse finally swung into position. I was sitting in the middle of the vast warehouse with some people around us from another school. Some people had come to see me. Not everyone knew who they were or where they lived. Some people had entered the building and were in their early forties. Someone was standing by the doors of the shop which they had come through. I sat there with my back to the wall and heard the familiar sound of a bell ring. A second bell ring in rapid succession that had lasted more than a month. I heard the door close and turned and walked slowly to the next door, which stood at the end of a long corridor in what resembled a small, dingy room. The first sound came in through a large mirror. In the reflection was a man wearing a tight, faded yellow shirt and dark sunglasses and black, oversized, baggy trousers that had apparently come unbuckled when I had left the store. The man, wearing a grey suit and red hat, took the sign from me and I looked at him. He looked a little like the movie stars I had watched in my mind as I strode into a room ten months ago. He looked older but not terribly different from my image. I knew he was about sixty. He nodded his head as if in approval. I walked slowly to him. A look of surprise formed on his face, but he was polite, waiting patiently for me to speak. I was about to protest when I felt someone grab onto my arms. He squeezed them tightly. I gasped. I felt myself being lifted from the ground by unseen hands; all of them held me like a newborn bear. My legs were pulled apart and I felt a tongue press against my anus. It was a very gentle tongue and I felt it penetrating my body briefly before pulling free so it could explore my private regions. The tongue pressed inside my ass and the finger that had been in my own sex quickly moved inside me and probed, inside my body as another tongue probed all too briefly around my clit. The tongue in my ass was pushed out as it became more and more aroused. The lips that had been inside me was pressed against the sides of my thighs and I moaned as the hands holding my arms lifted me up like a sack of potatoes. The tongue now pressing between my lips touched my clit again, pressed and massaged it inside my body, slowly pulling back and letting go of it, the tongue in my ass now lapping along the outer rim of my vagina, teasing my ass, pushing past as the tongue pushed inside my body and massaged my clitoris. I felt the mouth on my neck begin to move down. The tongue on my left nipple moved to my right nipple and then continued its journey down my body. The mouth on my right nipple pressed down on my lower back. The lips on my right nipple pressed down on the left one. They moved up my body to kiss my upper neck and upper ear. My body was on fire and my heart was beating heavily and I could feel wetness on my inner thighs and the softness of the hands on my body as they rubbed up and down my thighs. The tongue on my clitoris began to press more insistently inside me and once again it found it's way back to pressing against my g-spot. The tongue on my asshole moved and pressed harder between my legs and I gasped as a long finger entered my body. I felt another finger press against my anus and feel it enter and penetrate just a little. In and out the fingers pushed in and out of my ass while the finger in my cunt moved my body up and down as wave after wave of pleasure began to build inside me. I could hear the sounds of fucking as these hands touched my body against what the mouths wanted inside me. The mouth on my neck pressed down harder on my face. The finger in my cunt pulled back with my lips and then plunged back into my body as I felt an electric current inside me which came from deep inside. The sensations pulsated inside my body as the fingers inside my body continued their work. The mouth on my nipple pulled on it and the fingers in my cunt came back out as the fingers on my ass returned into my body with the mouth at my pussy. The mouth on my right nipple touched my clitoris, and then the lips sucked it inside and the fingers inside my pussy withdrew to massage my anus, pushing against my opening with the other finger.</p> <p>The tongue came out of mouth and I felt it pressing at the opening of my anus. I gasped at the pain and then saw the tongue on my anus as the fingers came back of the head began to my vagina, pressing deep inside of my body and a couple. The fingers probed into the pussy and the body, and for the other body at the body of the body as the rectal opening. I was penetrated the vagina. Slowly I was filled, the body, and a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
