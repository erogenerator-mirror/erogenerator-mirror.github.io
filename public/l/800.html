It became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately. Tom could not get away</strong> from the topic. The story of how life was done so tragically took over Tom's mind, until it was time for him to go to bed and make his self up.</p> <p>Tom was asleep that morning in his bedroom.</p> <p>The story Tom was concocted was also a very good, if very lonely—after being so many years older than him. Not that it was too much of a cliché: it was the truth. Tom thought, "I wonder—is there a reason why you know about my story? I was just being an old-fashioned girl. That would end well—if it's my fault. I can't have everything. I have to have something to do and be. It's my nature."</p> <p>Tom was still asleep when his mind opened up to the realizations of what it must look like to a woman, and what she could accomplish in her sexual abilities as she had in the story of him.</p> <p>Tom's cock was erect. He felt how excited it made him. Tom wondered if he would sleep as long as his cock did before it would be ready to penetrate another female. Tom wondered if the woman was beautiful, and not just in her own words. Tom would take whatever advice he could get from anyone. He felt it was only a matter of time before he would, and that he would. Tom didn't sleep as long as he wanted.</p> <p>He slept deeply. Tom was a man. Tom was very capable of sleeping. And there was no way he would be awake for something that long—or that long. Tom looked at the clock. Tom was already at his late-night walk through his own bedroom, when he woke up, which was right at the moment. Tom quickly turned his body to its original position—his body, which now felt the cold. Tom was a little startled that his body felt cold, even despite the fact that it felt cold.</p> <p>Tom got up and went looking for a robe to wear. He tried to take it off slowly and get out of bed before the cold became unbearable. Tom took his robe off, wrapped it in one hand and went back into the bathroom to get into the shower.</p> <p>Tom was still hard. He felt even harder if he thought his cock was hard. Tom had to feel it even harder to be at this moment. He didn't really have long of a cock. Tom knew that was going to happen sooner than later. Tom felt his cock get bigger. Tom felt his cock respond. Tom felt the cold. Tom couldn't feel any cold anywhere in his body. He felt him getting excited. Tom started to massage his cock with his hand in the shower.</p> <p>Tom moved his body toward the shower's door, as if the shower was a real thing. Tom opened the shower door slowly and put his head under the stream of hot water. Tom started to soap his cock with the soap. But he had always done it on his mind. And even though Tom was an adult, he loved doing it for himself, in case it would help him to continue in a more mature fashion and to satisfy his own body's urge to pleasure itself. Tom wanted to do it in all the beautiful girl-made ways he was going to enjoy today. Tom was getting more and more excited. Tom liked himself more and more, because he did what he loved. Tom continued to run his fingers down his cock. Tom felt good, because the soap felt nice; though he knew it was something else: Tom felt good because his own body craved to please his own body. He started to jerk off on his own hand a little bit.</p> <p>Tom's hand felt as if it is made of a million metal. Tom was getting more and more excited. Tom rubbed his cock as hard as he could.</p> <p>Tom felt his body starting to take over his consciousness. He could not control himself. His cock was as hard as a rock. And so was his head. Tom felt his cock head moving through his body. Tom didn't feel any pain—except pressure on his cock. Tom couldn't be shocked, especially by some sensation. The pressure on his cock caused the orgasm to take over his body—and Tom didn't like it.</p> <p>Tom let his cock take over his mind, his body, and his mind completely. He felt the feeling of his body as if he wanted to feel pleasure from all that he was not quite able to feel from his own body. Tom loved this feeling, almost more than anything else of it. He knew it. And it went beyond the pleasure his body is receiving. Tom felt totally at ease. The water on Tom's head made him feel as if he were in space. The feeling of soap that soap around his cock made Tom feel like he was actually floating. Tom's. But the feeling of his own hard cock as if he was him. actually made Tom. felt. felt as he got felt—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
