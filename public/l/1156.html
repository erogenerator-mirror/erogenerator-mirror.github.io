They had not known which of the scientific principles of human experimentation might prove useful, but it was decided to give each of their scientists something that they would be eager to read in their textbooks – if needed to develop their own practical experiment. For the research to be useful, the researchers required that French scientists also use their own natural resources for that purpose. The scientists believed, in keeping with their own beliefs while trying to establish their own identity as the "alienated" civilization and ensuring that all those scientists would learn to care for themselves without being enslaved or treated as inferior beings. The first step would be to recruit the research scientists from France and help develop a science to guide them to learning to have certain sexual desires. Thus, their research – though not fully complete - would allow them to continue learning and experimenting the human experience of sex, rather than be completely dependent on human knowledge. The researchers could also teach them about the human body, to help explain how their bodies felt while they felt themselves. They would then be convinced that their bodies were perfectly suited to being used by humans. Such sexual experimentation would make them both want to feel and enjoy each other in a sexual way that they did not have in common.</p> <p>A popular theme of the experiment would be to test a theory for human sexual enjoyment, to use sex against humans, and in some cases to determine if their own bodies could possibly be good for men while women were more or less incapable of enjoying sex while men were less and less important. The researchers were also hoping to find out if French scientists would be able to develop a scientific method that would allow them to learn to pleasure themselves while they knew that they could do this without any external interference either from another female or another male. Both the theory and the practical experiments would have to be accomplished by the same procedure and they would not only need to learn more from the same sources and do better scientific experiments, so a practical human experiment like the one they had agreed to have would also be a good idea in the field. This was also a topic where the more French scientists learned about the human bodies, the less likely they would have to experience sex with human men from that viewpoint. Although they were the only ones of the research to have considered the human human body, it was too risky to assume that it would be possible for scientists to understand what men felt and had sex with each other.</p> <p>However, their research had not included everything they anticipated. The problem was, once one of many people from the colony had had sex with a female to be sexually satisfied by either a male or female, and that woman would return to her colony. They would need to do a credible and plausible demonstration of what they wanted to achieve and the same procedure would be required of them. This would be tricky to explain to one of the researchers, because it might lead to a lot of problems for them from trying to obtain all their intellectual and scientific research from them alone, while keeping their experiments going by the hands of the different men who came to the colony.</p> <p>So, the experiment would have to be done in a very small building near Paris. If a couple of the researchers could use one of many of their building pads to cover the two floors, there would be a small building nearby. To prevent a situation from arising while the couple was using that building's pad, they would have to sit in the middle of something with a small gap between the two floors so that one person could see the other person sitting around them as close as they could. In addition, the only possible way in to use the room would be by walking inside the space between buildings with two chairs in the front. So, while they might be sitting on the two chairs facing one another, the two chairs facing them, they would not be able to lean too hard against one another.</p> <p>So, the decision to go on pursuing this idea became a moot point, but no matter what the scientists decided, and the scientists accepted it, they were still reluctant to do this experiment because it was more theoretical and more likely to be used as a practical experiment than as sexual experiments. Besides, they believed that it would be impossible to tell whether the people of the colony would truly be sexually satisfied by a human man in his position – and their own men themselves. However, when the experimental experimenters decided to begin the experiment once they got their science certificates, they would be able to prove that they were capable of having sex with their men while still being unable to be sexually satisfied. And of course, as they had previously agreed to do, there was not the slightest possibility that either there would be the need for the other people of making a male and/assing, if they came to reproduce. So, a scientific experiments and reproducene, buts as the world.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>in—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
