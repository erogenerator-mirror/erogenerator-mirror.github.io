If thou canst but withdraw conceit and opinion concerning that</h4><p><strong>which may seem hurtful and offensive, thou thyself art as safe, as safe may be. Thou thyself? and who is that? Thy reason. ’Yea, but I am not reason.’ Well,</strong> thyself is why. Now, let's not get distracted. Let's play.</p> <p>Well, the first time we started playing, we were watching a porno on my cam, but we didn't really know that they were real. I couldn't find any decent porno, and it didn't look like any of them looked real to me. I guess it's true that porno's are amateur, but porno was really quite good. But still, even after reading it, I couldn't find any good way to masturbate with one hand. So naturally, I put it away, and started with my other hand. I didn't really like all of the adult porn, and was actually happy to have a porno on cam to jerk off to. I think a little gay porn was all I could think of.</p> <p>I started off with my other hand, and slowly pushed down on my erection. That gave me an idea, and so, I started stroking myself on cam. I was enjoying what I was doing to myself, as a boy, but just as I thought of it I got out of control again. I wanted to suck it hard. I wanted my dick to explode in the confines of a warm, wet mouth, or a tight, warm pussy! I wanted to lick my own precum from my slit, and then suck it into my mouth and swallow it, and then let it go. I tried sucking it deep into my throat, but couldn't do it.</p> <p>I decided that I could do better, and I jerked off my dick while I pulled my foreskin off, and started stroking myself. It looked very interesting. In my porno on cam, we were in a position where I was sucking on a pussy, and being sucked off. I was really getting into it, although I couldn't feel what it was. What did it feel like? And how did it taste? I was about to cum, but I needed to stop so I could save my cum until later. I needed to get it out of my throat. I wanted to taste it. I wanted to feel its warmth and heat in my mouth. I wanted to rub it onto my body as I stroked myself. And then I wanted to be free of the confines of my foreskin with the head of my dick, and have a nice, warm, wet mouth that tasted even better.</p> <p>I felt that tingle that happens when I'm about to cum for the first time in my life. It's just like a buzz, and I wanted to taste and feel it. I wanted to do, and have, those few things in my fantasies that I've never done. I wasn't really gay, and I didn't even know that a bisexual woman could be such an erotic experience. So I just concentrated on what looked just as good, if not much better, as the porn I was watching.</p> <p>Soon, I could tell that my climax was approaching, and the feeling of the warm, wet mouth that was sucking my skin had gotten me to the point of no return. It was as if a light, hot jolt of electricity passed from my stomach down to my dick and it seemed to go directly through the tip of my shaft. It seemed to be coming from within my groin (I thought it was the tip of my dick). It felt like I was close to blasting! It was very, very strong! But not quite. I felt another jolt and felt a little surge, and then felt it again! Another jolt!</p> <p>But before I could come up, the feeling of my own ejaculation overcame me, and I lost the energy to keep stroking myself in those ways, not wanting to leave my cum in the warmth and wetness of the mouth I just had in front of me. I just wanted to lie back and try to get some more of the feel of it back inside me. But, I also wanted to see those things that had just occurred to me, and I decided that I couldn't masturbate any more. I also decided that I just wanted to sleep, rather than have my own mess come on my own, especially when I just remembered the pleasure of the orgasmic moment. I did my best to remain cool and confident as I lay there, still masturbating, while I waited for my semen to subside.</p> <p>I had a feeling of total satisfaction as I lay there, and it seemed that everything that went on, had just worked as I had imagined it to be. Even though it was very late and the whole idea of what I had just done, had been a pretty pleasant one of the first couple of times I masturbated to porn, I still couldn't believe that I had brought a new person to the idea, and, and actually felt such joy with the thoughtfulness.</p> <p></p> <p>I laid there, but couldn't have been any pleasure I was, but my penis inside my own mind, or body.
