Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time</h4><p><strong>for thee to respect thyself, will be at an end. Every man’s happiness depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect,</strong> that is the purpose of this act. I am here to fulfil thy desire, and will gladly satisfy thy mind and body and desire. The man I seek shall be satisfied, and thus my purpose be satisfied for the entire experience!"</p> <p>We fucked for a long time before he stopped cumming, and he got up off the couch and went on his knees in front of me. I looked at my cock, which was hard, which he now proceeded to massage, his eyes looking at it, as he licked and kissed the head, looking up at me, so he could watch it. Once again, I was hard. It was time for him to get a reward for the pleasure of his cock! I was a little embarrassed by myself, and felt guilty for it, but I had no choice but to continue. Finally, he came closer to me and we began kissing. He began by kissing my neck. My cock swelled and bobbed, until I felt it. He was as hard as ever, and it swelled to fullness. This was what I needed, to satisfy my lusty desires and desire. I started kissing him, and I felt his lips close to mine. A slow slide, and with his mouth open, our tongues began to touch and dance together. That one kiss sent my soul soaring, and I felt my passion rise. This act had been made more for myself than for the pleasure of it. I wanted to take his cock up inside me, and feel his pleasure at my touch. He wanted to give me his full pleasure, and so he lowered his mouth to my neck. He ran his tongue over it, and kissed it from my neck down his chest. When he reached my breasts he began to suck, and he took each one from its base into his mouth. After a couple of minutes, he moved down to his own and lay on his back. He lifted himself, and I had a perfect view of the swollen head of his cock. He started licking both of them, and he was as hard as ever, which made me even more excited. I was more aware of his cock than ever, and his actions, than ever before, had me really horny. I began to kiss his breasts and nipples, and he let him play with my head. He told me to kiss it very gently, I was to lick all over it, even suck it like a miniature penis, and he had me in a state of complete bliss. I loved it. He was the best lover I had ever had. He let me slide down the shaft of his cock, making me suck his balls as he rolled my head and I sucked his penis deeper and deeper into my mouth. He was so good. I could not remember ever having more than one orgasm at once. If I kept up this level, I would be cumming in no time at all. When I finally came, I couldn't hold on much longer. I felt as if I could cum a hundred times. I felt so full. I felt so turned on I couldn't stand it anymore.</p> <p>He told me to stand up. I did, and he moved me around. He said I had to have his satisfaction. As I was sitting on the couch and lying down, he began to masturbate, he asked me if I had ever masturbated, and I said yes, and he started stroking faster. Finally he was rubbing all over my body again, and his fingers kept going and stroking, and he had me sit up. He spread my legs apart a little, and I could feel his hand moving more freely and quickly. It felt wonderful! He was so good he would do just about Anything, all right! He began to lick and suck my hard nipples, as he moved his fingers in and out of my pussy, at both ends. I loved to feel his teeth touching my nipples. Sometimes, he would bite my nipples very hard enough to draw blood. I was in Heaven!</p> <p>He moved down to my pussy, licking the juices from it and moving his tongue up my slit, into my hole, circling around my clit, and back again. I knew I was going to cum any moment, and so he stopped and put two fingers in me, he rubbed his pussy to bring me over the edge, and I came for him, squirting juices out and all over his fingers and inside me. He began kissing his way up my thighs, and I was surprised, but delighted, at how good it felt so, to have my tongue working on my pussy. I was so turned on!</p> <p>When he finished his way up my body, and he stood up to put his cock at my lips, I opened my mouth to him and he slowly slid himself in. I thought he would stay hard, but he was so much deeper than I thought it would hurt him. I did, as he was deep. I had not felt him all the same, just the head, and I was as far as deep—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
