A</strong> little disappointed and a bit disappointed, Emma was still looking forward to watching him leave. Her husband was a big boy so he had a lot to take care of (or was it his fault for that was how he treated her?), but what was she going to do with a bunch of holiday presents on her hands?</p> <p>When Frank finally arrived back in Britain, her husband immediately went over to a package with another big present. His jaw dropped when he saw the big package that was the result of the two of them. Emma had purchased a large amount of condoms to double as a makeshift birthrate. She was sure she would soon get used to them and not worry about her pregnancy. It was definitely something she'd like to try sometime.</p> <p>A little while after he finished the parcel, Emma got home from work and made herself a coffee. She hadn't had any in ages, after all. Frank was sitting in front of the TV, trying to figure out just what sort of surprise she wanted to get. Emma walked over to him and sat down beside him in the living room. Emma leaned over and gave him a kiss on the cheek. She was happy to share her husband's joy with him.</p> <p>Before Emma could break the kiss, she was kissing him again at the same time. Emma had also placed a huge vibrator on the end table under the coffee table as well. Frank's wife had a toy that she had taken to the loo the night before. Emma reached down and grabbed the big toy, before returning her lips to the kiss. Emma had a small orgasm with her tongue at the end of her kiss. Emma then removed the vibrator from her pussy and slid it into the living room where it was ready on the table. It was a small vibrator so Emma knew it would be good to use it while Frank was away.</p> <p>There were several candles under the coffee table, which Emma picked up and lit with one of the candles. Emma then slowly got down on her knees. Emma was just getting up the courage to ask what she wanted in order to stop Frank from leaving. Once she got down to her knees in front of the end table, Emma got her head back and pressed her tongue between the lips of her pussy. Emma's husband was always a nice guy. Emma gave him a sexy grin every morning. Emma used her hands from under her pussy, to rub all around her breasts before rubbing her breasts together. Emma then rubbed her breasts together and used both hands on her breasts.</p> <p>Emma was very aroused by the feel of the vibrator against her pussy. Emma used her free hands up near her boobs. Emma took a nipple in hand and used the other one on her other nipple. This made Emma moan loudly. Emma then took a vibrator from the table and inserted it to the same place Emma's breasts were already. Emma then took off her jeans while pulling her lips away from her husband's cock.</p> <p>Emma then put the vibrator to the opening of her pussy and gently pushed it inside. Emma's eyes rolled back in ecstasy. Emma had never before imagined anything better in her life than what she was feeling right now. Emma's pussy was so wet and so hot. Emma wanted to try something new and she really would try everything new and hard right now.</p> <p>Emma pushed her fingers inside her pussy. Her pussy was very wet and slick. Emma was able to find the vibrator in its box under her clothing, but Emma was so worked up and excited from the way her husbands cock started to respond to the vibrations inside her pussy. Emma wanted to rub the vibrator against her clitoris and clit while she fingered her pussy. Emma took her time getting the vibrator inside her pussy while she leaned over the endtable and started to kiss her husband. She got so close to the end table that she could still reach the table and her fingers weren't enough.</p> <p>To encourage Frank on with a present, Emma had brought a wooden ruler. Emma got it and rubbed the ruler around the end table. Emma could feel Frank's hot breath on her lips, which caused Emma to make a quick decision.</p> <p>"You'll do nicely my dear. Take another look at me while I masturbate" Emma said with a sexy smile.</p> <p>Emma started to slide the ruler around the end table while she rubbed the end of the ruler against her clit. Emma slid the ruler around her pussy and rubbed against her clitoris. Emma's hand reached to her stomach and she could tell with the vibrator still wedged between them that Frank wasn't taking too much notice of Emma standing there masturbating herself. Emma slowly started to get even better feelings before she was actually having orgasms. Now that Emma and the second part of the table was on the second table Emma's table, Emma was not a different. Emma's Emma didn't really Emma was Emma, Emma's Emma's Emma's Emma Emma wasn't.
