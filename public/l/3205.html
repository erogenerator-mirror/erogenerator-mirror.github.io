English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>VI. THE PALE CRIMINAL.</h4><p><strong>Ye do not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the animal hath bowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of his eye speaketh</strong> his head; the eyes of all men hath not fallen, nor hath be thine eyes fallen. Ye did not mean to slay, ye judges and officials, but ye see, ye doth find the reason. Ye are not alone in this world, ye are not alone in the desert and we shall be united! Ye shall not be alone in the desert nor shall we be united!</p> <p>Chapter 1</p> <p>The Sun rose high in the sky, and the white light penetrated the clouds. White clouds are a constant in the desert. As I sat on that rock, I looked around to see my beloved Sun and my beloved Son, in their embrace, lying face to face. I had seen them kiss before. I had seen them kiss before and I would always remember it. I felt as one with them, the feeling of intimacy, and I didn’t care for them for some reason. I just wanted to have them both as my own. I wanted them both. I wanted to suck those perfect breasts of theirs to keep them alive, and to make them happy. Then I heard the sound of a horse behind me, and in my mind I saw it as a bird approaching, and the smell of food and a warm breeze was coming. I thought I saw a man moving behind me. I watched him close his eyes and look over his shoulder at me. Then he ran behind me, and ran out of sight. I could tell by the sound of his breathing that he was excited. I felt his hands on my shoulders; he grabbed me as he looked at me. I looked in his eyes and saw a hunger in his eyes that made me want to be made want. I couldn’t help myself. I closed my eyes and tilted my head back. I could feel his hard cock against the crack of my ass, he began to rub it. I shivered as the heat grew within me, and I felt the familiar tingle through my legs. I was so turned on, I was sure that I could have orgasmed if we had been alone. I opened my eyes with a scream as a finger traced the wet, sticky trail from my pussy up to my clit. My body quivered as the finger touched it, and I moaned. Then he removed his finger, and licked the juices off it. I couldn’t help myself. I opened my eyes again to see this stranger, and this stranger had my clothes off, and my pants and boxers, in his hands, and I felt his hard cock pressing against me.</p> <p>His face was as close to mine as he could get, our faces were only inches apart. I felt his hard cock against my belly, and I instinctively opened my eyes. He smiled, and asked,</p> <p>“Do you want me inside you?” I thought he liked it when I called his penis “penis”.</p> <p>“Yes, please!” I said again.</p> <p>“Please, I want you to make love to me. Let me look at you.”</p> <p>“I’ll make love to you in front of everyone.” He replied. He kissed my lips, sucked on my tongue, and we kissed passionately. I felt so sexy. His skin was silky to my touch. I felt my arms around his neck, feeling like a sexual athlete, kissing him as I enjoyed his muscular back, and the shape of that body. My arms were around his chest, feeling his hard muscles in my hands. I rubbed against him, and felt the firmness of his body. He leaned back, his body covered by the softness of my arms. I felt his dick against my thigh. Suddenly he pushed me back hard towards the rock, and I cried out.</p> <p>“Fuck him, I know!” I said loudly as I turned around, and looked down my body, at his dick. I reached into my panties. In my right hand I felt a large purple head. I looked at it for a while, and felt it throbbing, and I was wet. I put my panties on quickly, and I ran to the animal. He did it the same, and it took him a bit to get my panties on. Then he ran his hand along my leg down to my pussy. I pulled my pants together, and spread my thighs so he could get to my pussy. Then he entered me slowly, and it felt like heaven. I looked at the animal with pleasure, and we both looked at the human. I got scared then, as we both looked at the animal, and not us. We both wanted to see how this was going to go.</p> <p>The animal lus was holding the animal’s head with his mouth, and it was sucking it’s teeth and teeth, and tongue. “s head as he was licking a good.
