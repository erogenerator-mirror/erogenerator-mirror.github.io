It might have been half-past five o’clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen. He heard the beating of</strong> his heart. The beating of his heart and heart with its steady, steady beat. He felt as if he were in high class in the world of women. All around him, there was nothing but a beautiful, voluptuous woman. He could see the beauty of her in black silk, long black stockings, a black velvet choker, a matching black silk chemise. A single layer of dark material draped across her body in a figure eight on the garment. It was a figure eight. It was only an inch from the top of her cunt lips. And the black material flowed across it. In a flash the white material had parted to reveal a pair of dark thigh high stockings and a lovely black suspender belt. The panties were a dark black that matched the black stockings she was wearing. The tops of her stockings were laced with lace on their sides from the top of the stocking and the tops of the suspenders. There was nothing else but a sexy black satin bow girdle and the corset.</p> <p>He felt a sudden shiver in his body as he watched the front of the lingerie unfold in front of his eyes. She had arranged this outfit so carefully that she had created quite a sensual and erotic scene for him. For now he was a man. That was obvious.</p> <p>He saw her slip a leather cuff around the hand rail of the bed. Her hands were tied behind her back. She knelt over the face of the woman in the bra and girdle. She pulled the chain linking the cuffs tight up her own stomach and pressed her nipples hard against the leather. She moved her hand up one thigh from her right hip to the inside of her right thigh and pulled her stocking upwards to her inner thigh. She repeated this for the left leg. Then she lifted the stocking up to her thigh exposing the smooth flesh of her inner thigh with her fingers. Her pussy was already wet from their earlier coupling.</p> <p>The sight of this woman was too much for him. He was erect, his cock, which was hidden by a black silk boxers and his mind had not yet been able to focus on this woman in that context. She moved her hands up, caressing the smooth flesh of her thighs and pressing the backs of her hands against the front of her stocking. She pulled the girdle up and over her waist to reveal a pink bra strap and black stockings, and her breasts pressed against the black silk. Her nipples were erect, dark as dark chocolate. He imagined that she was wearing those underwear to work. She knelt so that her body could be caressed from opposite sides by his hands while he watched. She was breathing deeply, and he could feel her heartbeat. He longed to caress her breasts, her arse, her thighs, her pussy. These were his fantasies after all. He imagined his hands caressing her breasts and he hoped that her fingers were caressing his cock.</p> <p>She moved herself down the bed. He saw that she was naked. His eyes travelled down to her breasts where she lay on her back, his hands holding out his throbbing cock, and his eyes lingered on his cock. Marius felt his balls constrict. He wondered how tight they would be when she was inside him.</p> <p>The bed moved slightly as she leaned forward. He had seen her breasts come and go but never now as they were being exposed. He had seen her cunt and arse as she had slid her stockings up her legs. What was going to happen to her here? What was she going to do? This was not how he imagined it would play out. She would look at him and beg him and tell him to do something to her. Instead she was going to lie there waiting in anticipation.</p> <p>Marius heard himself moan, thinking of his mistress toying with her pussy, and wondering what it would be like to watch her with another man. Was this what it would be like if this was really her? Would she give herself completely to him and he would see her climax. Would she go further, to force her hand between her legs to release the pent up cum? This was what Marius had imagined, the power he felt as he was being fucked by his fantasy lover. Marius stood, feeling his throbbing cock throb in his trousers. He removed the boxers which he had discarded upon his bed. He wore nothing beneath, with his cock jutting out from his pants. He walked over to the bed and waited for his mistress to make the next move. Just as he knew that he would, there she lay on the bed, naked, her legs spread wide apart. The black silk of the stockings she had been wearing made her thighs look even more inviting. Her cunt lips parted to be looked inviting. He moved to see, to see her clit. She could not touch him touch in the woman that part, and tease his beautiful black woman that was being—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
