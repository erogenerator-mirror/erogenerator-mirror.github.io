G. Wells </h3><h4>In the Darkness</h4><p><strong>“We emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the</strong> Sphinx was still in the sky. By now, I'd been fucked hundreds of times, and in a way I would have preferred to die by the sea the next day. I didn't know if I could go again.”</p> <p>”I could try,” I whispered, pulling him down into my lap with a firm thrust. “But you're not in the mood either.” He bit his lip, and that did help set the tone for the rest of the ride.</p> <p>We got to the apartment building and I unlocked the door for him. “C’mon,” he said as we walked into the living room. I took his hands, pulling him down onto the plush carpet, still facing outward. “C’mon,” I said, then, using one of my hands to lead him by his cock, I began kissing him. I couldn't get enough of the feeling of his body pressed against mine as our tongues were wrapped together in our mouths. His hands traced every contour of my body, running up my thigh on the way to my breasts, and then back down again. With our hands still wrapped around each other on the hardwood floor, our kisses got more intense by the second. Then, as if by coincidence, his hands slid down to cup my ass and slide up to my breasts. He wasn’t as gentle as I’d hoped, and I couldn’t wait to feel his cock in me again. If only he knew how much I wanted to feel him inside me without all of his clothes on, I'm sure he would have.</p> <p>Just like that, he had me naked in no time – not just because I hadn’t been dressed – but also because I just couldn’t wait, because at that instant, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. Even though he was still fully clothed, I felt like I had a body made of satin and lace and had no panties to conceal. With his hands on my buttocks, he pulled us apart and moved up my body until he was kneeling at my head. For a moment, all I could do was stare at the black stud standing in front of me. It was still that black, even though I knew I could get lost in a little deeper blue. It’s a little longer than average, but it was only about eight inches long. For some reason, I think I got that right when I was younger, it’s about six and half inches if that’s what I’m thinking. That’s only one and a half inches in circumference, but it’s still more than one and a half inches wide – I could probably get a couple more than that. It’s about five-1/4 inches in diameter, but it’s not too short. It’s actually shorter than my wrist, which is more than average. If I tried to find him that narrow, I could get the idea that maybe, just probably, he was bigger than half that much.</p> <p>“Good god,” he said, almost apologetically. “I was so worried you might never get to be with a man.”</p> <p>All I could do is laugh, and then, once again, I let go of his cock and looked him in the eye. “So, you like to suck cock?” I asked.</p> <p>“Hell no.” He didn’t offer me any rebuttals. “I want you so bad, I’m afraid I’m going to cum in your mouth right here.”</p> <p>”Well, just hurry up and try, because I’m not so sure I want to feel your cum in there yet.” I said, then began sucking his cock until I could tell he was about to blow.</p> <p>“No, you don’t really want me to cum in your mouth when I'm about to cum in your mouth? I want to be in your mouth when I cum in you.” He laughed and came in my mouth. I swallowed, then sucked him off again, this time taking my mouth off him so we could kiss once again. It started out like another round of French kissing, but we both became lost in our own world of lust and desire. The difference being, he was just as willing to go down on me as I was to taste him. The differences were that he wanted me in my mouth, but couldn’t get close enough to taste him, and thus couldn’t even get his cock into my mouth enough to get his own it. To him, I only had to be in as far I was going. If I would need me to go, if I wanted, I need I would have to be able to be there just be there—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
