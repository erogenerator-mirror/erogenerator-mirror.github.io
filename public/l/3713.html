They had both seen and suffered a great deal; and if the vessel had sailed from Surinam</strong> square during the late Civil War when it was an invasion of the Middle East under British command, so had the two ships that were with the ship. So, why would it be a shame to fuck that young thing? And, the ship was old and in bad shape. She'd had her hair cut long, which was often, and she'd dressed to suit her body, which was a lot of different things than everyone else's.</p> <p>The ship was still on the horizon as she leaned back and kissed him again.</p> <p>"Not long." she said, as she took his cock in her mouth. He put the blanket aside and rolled over beside her.</p> <p>Chapter 15</p> <p>After they'd spent some time on the deck, the next morning, while still naked, they went into the Jacuzzi for some more fresh air, for good measure. This time, she took him into her as he sat behind her, her legs wrapped around his. He held her, as he bent down to take her tits in his mouth, and sucked on her nipples. She let her arms fall and wrapped around his neck for support, but held on to him with her legs.</p> <p>"It's okay," she murmured, almost as a mother would his words.</p> <p>He turned her around, facing the side of the Jacuzzi, his dick erect again. He lifted her legs and slid them over, up onto his shoulders, and pushed his cock into her.</p> <p>"Oh!" she cried, as his weight slammed against her ass cheeks. "Oh!" she breathed, as her ankles were pulled further apart. She turned her face upward and kissed him again, as he began to thrust into her hard. "Oh! Oh!" she cried between kisses.</p> <p>For their first time with a man, they became engrossed in the sex, and both came immediately. She cried out for him to "Fuck me," and he did.</p> <p>"You're coming in my pussy," she said. "You're coming in my pussy, right now."</p> <p>She felt him filling her, but didn't want him to stop moving inside of her.</p> <p>"I have to catch it with a condom," she said.</p> <p>"Then I'm finished." He kissed her again, and she pulled free from him. He was looking at her face through half closed eyes, while they finished themselves off.</p> <p>"We don't have to stop," she said, pulling the condom off of him, while pulling his hand to her mouth. "I want you to fuck me, all the way."</p> <p>He was beside himself with delight. Of course, there had to be an acceptable condom. She loved his cock inside of her, and even now, when she wanted to finish herself off, he was a willing participant.</p> <p>"No," she said as she pulled him close for a kiss. "I don't want to be in this mess, while you fuck me. There's no need."</p> <p>"Okay," he said. "You wanted it, I'm giving it to you."</p> <p>He pulled her upright with his cock and she kissed him. "You make the bed," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, with some enthusiasm. They kissed slowly while lying next to each other.</p> <p>"Come lay next to me," she told him.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>He got over her, his cock hard, pressing into her thigh. She let her leg fall and opened her legs wider. He slid his cock between her legs, and found her pussy slick with lubrication from the morning. He slipped his dick into her, moving the tip of it upwards, towards her clit.</p> <p>"Is that okay," she said, as he touched her there.</p> <p>"It feels good," he said. "It feels good."</p> <p>"It's okay," she said again, her head on his shoulder, as her hand slid into his hair. "Come on. Touch me."</p> <p>He brought his hand forward, and touched her clitoris with his index finger.</p> <p>"Ah!" she cried. "Oh! Oh!"</p> <p>He followed a few fingers, and then went back to his thrusting. She put her hands on his ass and tried pulling him upwards into her. He pushed down onto her. She pushed back, and pulled his cheek. His cock slid in and out of her pussy. She was so slick with oil she couldn't even tell his cock was ever going to come out of her!</p> <p>"Yes!" she cried. "Yes! Yes! Yes!"</p> <p>She kept saying "Yes", until his penis slid inside of her, and his fingers came again. in. "Yes!" was, and again "Oh!" . his, and last. "Oh." his arms. . .
