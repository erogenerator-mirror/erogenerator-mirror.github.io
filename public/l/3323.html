English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXV. The Magician.</h4><p><strong>The Magician is of course an artist, and Nietzsche’s intimate knowledge of perhaps the greatest artist of his age rendered the selection of Wagner, as the type in this discourse,</strong> by itself. To be honest, however, I had been looking for the book, and the woman, from Nietzsche’s works. And I hadn’t found my woman. The woman was not in the book. For all I knew, an image of the woman would still be a woman to me of a lifetime. The Woman of the People! The Woman of the Realm! And I would make love with.</p> <p>So it wasn’t a particularly satisfying day, and I couldn’t believe how I got here. On the other hand, I had a date; which would be something I would remember with great regret. I felt very tired, but also very horny as I approached the house. I would have preferred to stay, but my boyfriends wanted me here at my house.</p> <p>I entered the house through the back door. I had already checked for any other guests to let me in; and, I think I had even located the master bedroom, so I could have had the perfect opportunity to change.</p> <p>To my pleasant surprise, the bedroom was all lit up and I could already hear the sound of a bed being pounded repeatedly. I was not expecting to be in the room with the person I was expecting to be fucking. It was too late. Someone already had her clothes off and was bouncing on the bed in search of her orgasm.</p> <p>The lady of the month was already on her back, having just got the pleasure of having her lover’s cock inside her. I walked over to the bed and sat on the edge. In case I hadn’t already read his name at some point, I decided to start by describing how we got here. This should be easy since I had already been involved in some rather naughty play by the woman of my dreams. For a brief moment, I noticed that I was still sitting on the bed as I said:</p> <p>“I hope I’ll get to be a part of your sexual fantasy tonight.”</p> <p>The woman was still on her back and had a hand inside her pants, pulling and rubbing her clit while she enjoyed having her lover’s cock inside her. However, her lover pulled out and entered her again, this time slowly. She leaned forward, and gave a short gasp as she felt herself being invaded from behind. The man, who had been kneeling in front of her, was now at her head. He had his lips clamped on hers with a look of pleasure as his tongue rubbed against hers. She had been riding him at all the time, but now she was facing him. Their bodies began to move slightly as she felt the man at her rear entrance being pressed against her. She began to feel something else - a strange feeling - but it wasn’t the same as the cock inside her. It was different - though it felt wonderful - it felt as though the man at her pussy was actually trying to enter her, pushing into, and pushing against her.</p> <p>I had to restrain myself, but I was going to keep that feeling going for now. Maybe later I would come across another woman, who I’d be able to share it with when I was with all my fantasies fulfilled. At some point in the evening, I had to remind myself to be sure.</p> <p>For now, I just had enough room to sit and wait. The woman on her back felt another mouth on her tits, as another mouth sucked on hers. With these thoughts, she raised her hips as if to push it inside. The man, whose face was being played with by himself, was now at her front entrance, now pushing his cock into what had to be the wetness of her pussy. The feelings were overwhelming. My own penis was throbbing, wanting to touch it. But I couldn’t.</p> <p>The woman had her legs wide before they reached her waist. She was now sitting on the end of a bed. I sat down on the bed just as she reached a hand behind her to pull her lover’s cock out of her pussy. I knew this was an act, of course, to let her know that she could have some fun with us. However, the woman, meanwhile, had lowered herself onto her lover’s tool, taking up a pace that increased each time she lowered herself onto it.</p> <p>The woman on her knees and elbows were raising her hips against the man’s chest, while the other was now riding him. I looked up as she felt her lover’s cock touching her stomach. If she couldn’t ride him, she could probably ride the others who rode him, but it wasn’t any good to try to hold back such a strong feelings from a little while it was being with a guy’s erection. very hard, if you like it was. She was riding him. My cock, the head of his hard.</p> <p></p> <p>to her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
