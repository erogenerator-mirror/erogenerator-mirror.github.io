He had not read it in years, but in fact, the Emperor had made it a rule that every man had a copy in that hand and never took it. The meaning was obvious, as in this copy was the Emperor's own. There was no need for him to make it back home to Russia to find the King.</p> <p>The Emperor looked at her with a look that made her melt—if he hadn't seen the beautiful lady of his dreams on the first step, he would have felt bad—that he had never actually seen her before. He had not seen her in decades, yet had it looked as though he was losing his mind.</p> <p>"I trust you to find my copies, my young Prince," the Emperor said as he picked up her copy, placing it inside his pocket and turning his attention back into the present moment. "Do you wish to return them? They are so beautiful. I hope you will enjoy them as much as I will."</p> <p>"Of course I will. I will definitely enjoy them," the heroine replied as she turned to leave.</p> <p>The Prince and Princess looked at each other for a long moment before the prince reached over and turned on the power that was all her. She stepped onto the bridge, as the Prince went into the castle, leaving the Prince standing on the dais of the capital of the Duchy of Hanaan on one of the balconies. The Royal Crown was draped over her shoulders and the royal palace was on her left arm. The Prince and Princess were standing on the balcony of the cathedral she'd visited on the anniversary of her mother's funeral when the Princess returned to her room. Their bodies touched and they both knew that the passion they once shared would never be forgotten.</p> <p>The Prince closed the distance between them in three ways; first, he held her hand and then he leaned in for a kiss—the kiss that had begun months before when they had stood talking across the street just outside the court doors. They kissed for nearly an hour, and the kisses got more urgent as each had to hold back from what was about to happen. The Princess's fingers, those fingers which he had been holding close, found their way down the Prince's back to the top of his pants. Soon they were pulling down his pants, then they were kissing with as much passion as they could muster.</p> <p>"May I?" the Princess asked.</p> <p>The Prince smiled as his hands went straight inside her top, under her bra, and under her lacey blue sports bra. He pulled the bra cups away from her breasts, so his mouth was immediately on each nipple. "You are such a beautiful, sexy creature," he said with a grin as he bit them through her sports bra.</p> <p>His hands were everywhere. They made it difficult to keep from moving away from the Princess when her fingers were buried in his hair. He was a man on his knees, sucking on her breasts while she was riding him through another orgasm. He was almost there, but she stopped him when he tried to pull away. He moved his hands again, feeling her soft skin. He slid one hand under her skirt, pushing the material down until he was finding and sliding a finger between her legs. "I don't want you to stop," he whispered as both hands moved over her breasts, teasing her nipples.</p> <p>"Of course not! I want you...to continue...for as long as you desire." She looked into his eyes, smiled and then kissed him. He felt her tongue on his lips, and then she was kissing him again, taking him into her mouth in one go. Now was the moment the Prince longed to be inside the woman who had stolen so much of his heart and had fallen hopelessly in love with him. Now was the moment he had to satisfy her desires in a way that would make her feel she would have been happier than ever.</p> <p>The Princess broke the kiss and looked at him. Her eyes made him so happy, and then she was kissing him, too, but before they could make a third trip, both had their skirts thrown over their heads and were already naked. The Prince and Princess stood for some time before their lips parted. They kissed again, passionately. The Princess whispered in his ear, kissing him. She wanted to feel how he would experience what he had felt inside her.</p> <p>"Now we are going to make that last, the most memorable event in our lives together," the princess said between kisses.</p> <p>Their lips met and their tongues played inside each others mouths. The Prince's hand slipped underneath the Princess's skirt and felt her bare skin once more, before his fingers had made their way inside her wetness. The Princess closed his fingers and her legs, and the folds and the petals. He slipped and they were the way. Together they moved her insides and the way and the way there, they shared where their tongues of the way they got the way—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
