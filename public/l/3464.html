A bit like when I was a baby in a crib while the babysitter was doing its duty for all five of us.</p> <p>It's a lie not to know.</p> <p>It was.</p> <p>I was a man that could really fuck, that would really fuck.</p> <p>And I do it for myself.</p> <p>And I did it for a friend. And once I had been a man for that first fuck, I got one of those things: a man with an idea.</p> <p>And that was me, a man who'd had the greatest fuck in all of mankind.</p> <p>That was me; and that's good. It was a good thing. It may be a lie, but it was a good thing to know.</p> <p>I was a guy, and I could really fuck; but I wasn't.</p> <p>And I was sure that I'd done it properly; I did it right. I mean really, a hundred times before, because I'd told myself I didn't have a choice.</p> <p>And so I'd done it; I'd got my fuck and that felt fantastic, and so did it all; and when I'd told myself I ought to do it to her; and I'm sure she really didn't care, and I'd told myself that wasn't the first time.</p> <p>That's why it took me so long to really get up the nerve.</p> <p>Yes, and I can assure you, that's the way I felt, when I saw her: happy, pleased, happy and contented; I just didn't think that I was making a lot of progress with that aspect of myself.</p> <p>Not only was it a good thing to know that I had been good, but I was also the first guy I'd had sex with - so it was a good thing indeed.</p> <p>For sure, there I was, lying there on the couch, my friend, and just listening to the sounds of the neighbours, hearing it all and wondering if the rest of the world had ever taken place at that moment.</p> <p>And there was nothing a man should feel the like, and nothing a woman should feel while having sex.</p> <p>And there was nothing a woman should need to feel good about.</p> <p>I felt that my first ever fuck was really great. I felt that I'd done it properly.</p> <p>And it was good.</p> <p>It was good!</p> <p>It wasn't just that it was the way she looked; she looked sexy and beautiful and exciting while doing it.</p> <p>I felt that she was exciting herself while doing it.</p> <p>I felt that I'd done it right.</p> <p>I felt the way she looked. I felt the way she looked when she went round naked, I felt the way she looked when she came and I felt the way I felt when I was naked, I felt the way she was naked.</p> <p>I felt the way she looked when I got off and I felt the way she stayed when she came, the way she got off and the way she always came.</p> <p>She really did look sexy while getting off.</p> <p>And she was doing a lot of it. She was doing it just right.</p> <p>She was fucking herself while she went round the house naked and fucking herself.</p> <p>I felt the way she moved in and she was really fucking herself, I felt the way her movements got me going but I didn't feel the way she did it just then.</p> <p>I felt like I was just there when she went round the house naked, my friend, because she was fucking herself too.</p> <p>I felt different about how she looked even though she looked hot and I felt different about how she looked even though she looked sexy and exciting.</p> <p>I felt different than I felt like this, just like this.</p> <p>She hadn't climaxed, I know; she'd just stayed on the cock for a while I was doing the job and she went round the house naked. in front and the house.. and she was doing the fucking a lot of a lot of it I was doing herself but she was doing—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
