Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin</strong>. But he did not stir beside me. I wondered if my absence had meant sleep, though I could have been too much for him. That I would find him again, and if that were indeed the case, there was another way to find him. I turned on the light, and searched for him, but there was no sign of his body. I crawled out from the darkness and into the open spaces beyond the doorway and found the light, I knew where he had been. He had already left, and had only come out once after all we had been through. I took out my violin and started playing, the first few notes of the piece that I could not hear. Once I had finished, my fingers ran over the wood and the strings of the piece perfectly. I looked down to see if I had done so well. The first thing I noticed as I stared into the light was that there was no trace of him. After some struggle I resolved that I must have been just fooling myself. I reached up and slowly drew away the blindfold that was covering my eyes. My mouth fell open with a start and the light hit my lips. I was so excited, my heart rate increased as I ran my hands over my shoulders. I traced my hands down my chest and let my hands run down to rest on my hips. I ran my hands all over myself and pulled my hair off my shoulders and head. My hands dropped down again and ran down over my thighs, my inner thighs, my stomach and my upper abdomen. I pulled my hands all the way down to my pubic hair and stopped. I had just started doing this when the light changed again. I started to pull my body forward, trying to figure out when it was the second time. I kept searching until I found what I was looking for and ran my fingers over the slit of my vagina. It didn't take long for it to begin making my heart rate soar. I pulled my finger into the opening for it's first feel of the night, letting it slide in. I couldn't get there fast enough. My fingers played all over my body as my pussy throbbed with hunger. In moments my body was on fire, and I started to run my fingers up and down my clit with a regular rhythm. I brought my hand around to cup my breasts and started to tweak my nipples, teasing. My heart rate was back as I started to circle my clit when it started to twitch. I put the tip between my lips and teased it. I was surprised that it had started to throb, it had been building since the first time I played it. I took one finger onto my clit and tried to rub it. It didn't take long after I started teasing and I could feel my own orgasm approaching. For the final time, I took my finger out of my pussy and let it just slide along my slit to my entrance.</p> <p>I heard myself moaning as I came, a flood from my vaginal canal filling my fingers. It didn't matter that I was soaked, or anything else that I really cared about, I just had to find him. I pulled my fingers out and started to remove them, which I found I could not do with just my hand. I pulled them off and used my fingers to find his penis. I took them once again and pressed them on his cock. I couldn't even see it, I had found him. It jerked, and I didn't know if he was aware of it, but I could feel him jerking underneath me to keep his cock from being trapped. That would have been too close to orgasm. I didn't need to find him now. I started to pull off that night, my pussy leaking and my breasts hanging to tease. I tried to get a hold of his body, but I couldn't move. I was getting scared and I didn't care. I couldn't think clearly. I could only imagine what was possible with a sex object like his penis.</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and got undressed, only leaving my night dress on. I pulled at the night gown to no avail. Suddenly I felt hands touching me everywhere on my breasts and my stomach and my legs. I felt his hands on my skin, touching my hips, thighs and everywhere. Then another hand moved towards the centre of my groin. I had to have him in me, I couldn't just have him in me. I didn't have to stop them from reaching the outer lips of my pussy, so I lifted my dress up and over my stomach and stomach and let gravity pull it down my body. It lifted up and let go around my breasts. Then it reached the waist, I was free, the legs, and fell my feet too was free, and I had never leaving myself completely free for once more to him. I was free. He was on free. I let myself. We had free for him I could do as I felt free I was free I was able to freeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
