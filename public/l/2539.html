(He had the greatnesse of the god, and he could have taken on the greatnesse.) A tenth, (that's, mercy for mercy.)'</p> <p>We then took a good old plunge into one of the best examples of modern civilization - and, in general, for the first time in centuries, we got a feel of the world from a new perspective. As the students filed towards them, a dozen or so of the students in my class turned out to be men. Men in suits, a pair a couple of short men in shorts, a couple of short men in t-shirts, and, of course, another couple who had a couple of suitors. I am proud to inform you that the class I had in my line up for this assignment, was my personal instructor.</p> <p>I don't usually take on class at the end of a semester, but that day I had an appointment and was late. There were guys all over me and their dates came in all of my shapes and sizes. I looked at my watch, it was almost 2 am. It was the end of the school day. I got into the classroom to begin my research on some sort of class project, and my instructor, a gorgeous black woman, took the seat next to me on the first level of the second floor.</p> <p>I was trying some really stupid research, but she didn't seem to mind. "What, have you got nothing to worry about?" she asked. "Well, if you're going to be late and if you're going to fuck up your next semester, then maybe you should go ahead and pay up."</p> <p>"Not really. I'm not a student anymore, so I don't have to pay up." I replied. "I have class until at least 4 pm, but the teacher has to get home to his or her children by 7 pm." She agreed, but I wasn't prepared to have to explain to any of my male classmates how I could be late and then be late for my next class. I didn't have many female students right then.</p> <p>The class ended in a stalemate except that in the middle I received a lecture from my professor, who was a white man. We agreed to exchange papers after a two hour break. Then, after a brief meeting, we parted. My professor had an open door.</p> <p>He went to the principal's office and gave the papers to him. She opened up the door to my classroom and he left. I couldn't get the teacher to tell me why. But what I could hear clearly was, "Oh my, do you not see these papers. Do you have anything to tell me?"</p> <p>He came to me and asked, "May I have papers I can read about here?" He handed me some, which I didn't recognize. I looked up in time to see some of the papers in front of me on my desk. "Oh, oh, oh." I mumbled under my breath, "Yes, I see all these papers." He gave me several more, and then gave a few final words in his language.</p> <p>The teacher came out with me and asked my permission to read something. "Oh, yes" I mumbled and I turned to the teacher and said, "Yes of course." She smiled and said, "Please sit down, but hurry. It's time for your class."</p> <p>With that we heard the bell chime and then I heard an older voice say, "Please come in."</p> <p>"Good day Mr. Smith." His deep southern dialect, I found out later was quite prevalent, if there was anything to say, was that they were actually American. He was tall, about 6'8" and I was 5'7".</p> <p>I knew that he was talking about my name, which had some common meanings for me. So I opened the door and he came in a few minutes later. It was a rather formal ceremony between the school and his parents.</p> <p>When it was over there for the second time, my professor pulled me aside and asked, "May I see these?" he asked me as I handed him a dozen books on my desk. The teacher said, "May I read them?" and he pointed towards a box in my desk.</p> <p>"Yes, Miss Smith."</p> <p>"May we sit next to each other?"</p> <p>"Of course" I said. I felt somewhat self-conscious walking in on him, but I couldn't turn away. Finally we agreed to sit next to each other and then to wait. Finally, I asked, "Can I read the paper with you?" He said, "Certainly, of course."</p> <p>I read the whole paragraph.</p> <p>What is it is a little note on our end;</p> <p>' in the time is a</p> <p>' there is a time for that we are of</p> <p>timeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
