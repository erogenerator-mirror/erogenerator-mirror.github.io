She couldn't wait.</p> <p>As a good fellow, I'll do a good job to fuck her tonight.</p> <p>To the best of his knowledge, the very first man he had since graduating was going to fuck you in your sexy, short skirt. To his knowledge, it never even occurred to him, but it happened. Even if he succeeded, he would have to try just once more before he allowed someone else, even an old lady, to screw things up. He and the other man were doing the exact same thing: one of those cocks, and the other a long pole.</p> <p>His body language said to wait, though it was not so much as for anyone else to say a word, for him, it was for the cock and the woman.</p> <p>They could be gone soon and he could have sex with her in front of them, but he had to be ready for that long hard cock to enter her pussy.</p> <p>There were two things he wanted to do: to be at the park, watching her undress, to fuck her, and take her to bed.</p> <p>"Oh, God, please fuck me," he'd ask.</p> <p>Not in this park. Not with some random girl.</p> <p>He was going to wait for her to be standing a minute or two, and then he would walk up and have sex with her. A second later, it was time to go.</p> <p>So far, it has been almost as much fun, the first time, fucking in front of him, the second. Two strangers waiting for a woman from a park who was going to get fucked. To the best of his knowledge, the women were two strangers: women with no desire to have intercourse, and a stranger in whom they were having sex. Two strangers, to be in front of each other, fucking the lady for both their own, their own desires. Two strangers for each other. And then one of them would be ready for them. It couldn't be bad though.</p> <p>"Oh, God, let me," he'd say. "My God, you are so beautiful."</p> <p>It was the second time, and he had to wait for her. And, of course, he wanted to fuck her first.</p> <p>It would be fun to screw her first. But, after five or twelve days, he couldn't give her a fucking. It wouldn't be as sexy to have a stranger, waiting on him. So, instead of having two strangers on his arm, his cock would be waiting for her. She would be his.</p> <p>She'd be ready for him, and in his arms. The man who had gone away and left her, not just on her knees and begging to be fucked, but with that dick inside her.</p> <p>He'd want to fuck her.</p> <p>She, so hot. So wet. So sexy.</p> <p>Her pussy was beautiful.</p> <p>He couldn't wait.</p> <p>She would want him. And he knew it.</p> <p>But she was afraid that he'd not like it, because she would have said that he was evil for having a penis for a woman. But he was not evil: it was nice having a penis.</p> <p>She would have said that he was the kind of man who didn't like the way she looked: sexy and sexy. And when he wasn't horny and could walk straight into a park and fuck her, she would have said that he was the kind of man who didn't want to give the woman a good fucking so he could leave her alone. But she couldn't have said those things because he was evil too. She wanted. Just as he couldn't give a man good fucking for a woman, he couldn't give her a good fucking because that was the best that they could do, right?</p> <p>In the park, it was going to be very nice to have a penis inside her.</p> <p>He had to wait. It was so hard to wait.</p> <p>He had to wait. It was so hard to wait.</p> <p>He was going to have to wait until she said that it wasn't the good things that had to be waited for. No, it was going to be for the best, because when it was, she would have said it was nice and everything had gone as planned.</p> <p>Oh, God.</p> <p>"Oh, God," he had to say.</p> <p>"Yes. Right here. Right now," she had to say.</p> <p>"Just let me do it," he had to say.</p> <p>"No, please. Don't fuck me first. Please. I can't stand this."</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes, please," as she had to say.</p> <p>That's okay, do it, right here, please. And come here, as right now.</p> <p></p> <p>. —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
