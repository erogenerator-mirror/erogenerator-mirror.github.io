English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XVIII. Old and Young Women.</h4><p><strong>Nietzsche’s views on women have either to be loved at first sight or they become perhaps the greatest obstacle in the way of those who otherwise would be inclined to</strong> be the most effective opponents to Men.</p> <p>“Why did they go to all the trouble of making themselves available for that.” A sad look crosses his face.</p> <p>The answer that he came, as he had hoped, was probably because the people who taught him how to read female anatomy called him the best example of male anatomy known to man. The next time he saw the woman he had seen naked hundreds of times before, she did so all over again.</p> <p>The most profound part of her anatomy was the lower half of her body. The right half was the object of his interest: her genitalia.</p> <p>There was an image of herself in a man’s fantasy. A picture came to his mind, when he was a young lad. He was studying some ancient history of women from the time of Manstung, and there she was, spread around the world, a pair of beautiful green-eyed beauties.</p> <p>The image of her breasts became a more realistic one, as he stared at them. She was a beautiful sight. Her breasts were full and proud. He remembered their size and shape, all the years he had been studying the human body.</p> <p>“I’m just going to have my lips around that little nub you have there for my pleasure.” He says. “Would you like to have it?”</p> <p>It was the only thing he could say. Her body, her beauty. His penis began to respond to her. He stared at her. When he looked over at her, though, her beauty and her pleasure always took his mind away from the book of woman’s sexuality and pleasure.</p> <p>His hands moved to the hem of his tee shirt.</p> <p>She didn’t say anything, but he felt the fabric lift slightly under his touch. He reached his hand to her, and she didn’t pull back, yet. Instead, she pulled away from him, leaned down to kiss him.</p> <p>A tear rolled in one of her eyes, and he kissed it away. Her tongue tasted of salty water, the salt of the sea. Suddenly, she backed away.</p> <p>He didn’t want to go there. His heart felt as though it was moving against his chest, though his head rolled back.</p> <p>His hand slid down to her ass, lifting the hem of her dress and exploring her warm, soft skin. It was smooth and full. He felt that she was wearing panties.</p> <p>His head was still swimming with desire, though his mind was already on other things. Her breasts, her hips, her neck…his penis was raging in his shorts, in his pants.</p> <p>One hand slipped under her panties, and he felt that she was wet, too…so warm.</p> <p>She parted her legs and spread them wide, just as he was doing. He took his head in his hand, feeling it press against her sex. There it was, like an explosion at the tip of his penis, a flood of pleasure that flowed outward from it and to flood down his erection.</p> <p>The image of the pink bud of her clitoris was again there with him. A different sort of pleasure than when he was still studying, but so close and yet so far away, now.</p> <p>She pushed him away, and stood up. She took her panties in both hands and brought them to her face. She pulled them down slowly, like a child might take off a dress.</p> <p>Then she grabbed his cock and guided it to her opening. It seemed as though she was holding onto something to hold onto, and she began to push down her lips along the full width of his long shaft. It felt as though her lips were sucking the tip of his cock, instead of entering her vagina.</p> <p>He didn’t see, but he certainly felt her opening. The moisture running from her vagina, the moisture and warmth of her sexual lubrication and of the juice that flowed out from her body as she fucked him. It was pure and clear. She was so wet, so warm, so sweet.</p> <p>She stopped moving and pressed down slowly. She pushed a little harder and stopped completely, as that was all she could do. Then, slowly and gently she began working herself down again, again and again, sliding down on his shaft, all the way to the base of his penis.</p> <p>He felt it go inside of her, the softness of the walls of her vagina, the smoothness of her vulva. They were joined in one, as her softness slid past his penis, into his shaft.</p> <p>He began to feel everything she had done so many times with other girls, his fingers or their clitorises or penis and vagina, penis, vagina, as it, to his mind as, other hand, penis and clitoris, the one.
