He found that all the way down town. "It must be German." He thought.</p> <p>He had thought up a joke to go with his German when something happened the first time round. A girl, a lassie, a girl named Hana-Sophie, was talking to a man that had obviously been there. Not much of a joke, he thought, but maybe it would be a good prank to just pretend like he didn't even like a woman and do what he was told to do, he thought.</p> <p>He had come to Munich a little earlier to get the idea, and was thinking about Hana-Sophie, his "associates," the one who had told him that he'd like to have sex with more women. He was thinking more about Hana-Sophie, his "fuckslut," a girl that was talking to him when she was horny, was trying to find a way to get him to go with her. That was why he had agreed to come along with them.</p> <p>He had followed them because they had a reason. They had seen that the German soldiers had sent the girl, the girl that they saw as a "fucking cunt," to Hana-Sophie's castle, where they would be able to "fuck whoever they wanted," if they wanted to.</p> <p>He had wanted that because before Hana-Sophie herself had asked him to come along, he had wanted nothing more than just to be her fuckboy.</p> <p>The Germans had been angry when he said that, because even having a fuckboy was too shameful. He had said, "I'm sorry," instead.</p> <p>"No, you're sorry; I'm sorry that our country is too cheap to fuck," he thought. He'd fucked her, so he would have been able to leave Germany when it was a free country without having to pay rent or have to go to a war.</p> <p>But this was the third time that he had thought about Hana-Sophie. First the one who had been talked about by the lassie. Now he'd have to talk about girls, women, and war. She was talking about sex and everything else around her.</p> <p>"Hey, I'm not going to buy a drink if you don't want one," Hana-Sophie had said, and then she had gone and changed her clothes, the "fuckslut." He had thought that a drink might make it easier to think, but something had been different.</p> <p>He had tried to make it seem that he wasn't interested in anything or someone else, and now he'd been able to think that something had been different, too. Maybe, he thought, it was Hana-Sophie, because she had kept the German soldiers amused. She had smiled, and waved to the lassie.</p> <p>"You said that it didn't make you think you could fuck someone," had said, as he had sat down in a booth, and, thinking that it had seemed to Hana-Sophie, he'd said "But only you're a fucking slut," and, then he'd left.</p> <p>Now he had known what it was. As long as he was there with Hana-Sophie, he was okay with going to some cheap hotel in Düsseldorf and having sex with his wife.</p> <p>"So what did you think, Hana-Sophie?" he had been thinking then.</p> <p>"Sure, it looks nice," Hana-Sophie had said, as she was standing over him in a short skirt that she wore, and a blouse that only just held her breasts in between her breasts.</p> <p>"You said that you liked watching me and Hana-Sophie, you know," he had said, as Hana-Sophie had sat next to him and leaned over so that he could suck her right nipple.</p> <p>"I thought you were the man I was looking for," Hana-Sophie had said, in his German, and then she had leaned down and kissed him hard on the lips.</p> <p>"I told you, I had to get fucked, to get fucked," he had said in his German.. he had said, his throaty with one hand in between her breasts. "I'll love you breasts."
