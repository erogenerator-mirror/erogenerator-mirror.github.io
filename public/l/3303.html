English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XLI. The Soothsayer.</h4><p><strong>This refers, of course, to Schopenhauer. Nietzsche, as is well known, was at one time an ardent follower of Schopenhauer. He overcame Pessimism by discovering an object in existence; he</strong> made the objects of his study available to one and all of the students. The object was the body of one of the many objects in existence, namely.</p> <p>The professor was a handsome man, and his penis was long; but that wasn't the best point of view. It was still large and long; he was about average size, about six or seven inches.</p> <p>It was easy to assume that his penis was average. In the sense that it was about five and a quarter inches in length, the professor always measured it by one or more inches. He was a man of average, or near average height, at about six feet and one hundred and fifty pounds. His body had very little excess fat, no, rather he was very slim. The professor's body hair was not much thicker than his.</p> <p>Although it wasn't hard to guess that the professor knew what he was doing, when it was so easy to calculate the shape of an erection, the professor was a well-endowed man; and, though average, he was over six feet tall. He made erections when he pleased his body, but the professor still used that knowledge for the purpose of making him an easy target.</p> <p>The professor wasn't a bad professor; he used his knowledge to better shape his body, and to increase his value to the academic community. With a six and a half inch penis, he was in decent shape, and he loved to dress up in casual clothes; usually in the form of a blouse and pants, but occasionally in formal affairs. A blouse and pants showed a lot of cleavage; the buttons on his blouses and pants could also be considered, and the cleavage showed its color as well.</p> <p>The professor also liked to talk to other men, while he was fucking. He would often joke around that he had an American accent or, even better, that he knew a good thing about English. He would often add that he knew a good thing about a good thing, but he wasn't going to let that get to him. He liked to say that he had learned English since he was a young man, and that he now knew something about English.</p> <p>The professor was good in bed, but he was still an arrogant man, and a bit too arrogant, in both senses of the word. The professor was a man of great wealth. He was well-known for using his wealth to satisfy his every need. And, despite his arrogance, his body was very desirable.</p> <p>The Professor liked to show a bit of confidence in his body. He liked to talk a lot, and to compliment his friends. When he was in college, his social manners were the stuff the Greeks call 'bull'. There was little doubt that he knew much in the world of the English language. He had the ability to tell other people just what they wanted to hear.</p> <p>The Professor had a few personal friends, and they had a pretty good rapport. They would do anything to get a taste of him.</p> <p>After college, when it was time for graduations, the Professor's friend went home, and that led to an affair; he was able to seduce a very attractive girl for sexual satisfaction; but they had to leave soon after graduation. With his reputation as Mr. Stud, for the time being, the Professor was just happy to have made a pass at the young student.</p> <p>During that time, during the summer before the final semester, when it was Christmas, the Professor was visiting his girlfriend and her boyfriend. While he was at one of his "friends", he invited one man to attend his party for the evening. The man was, of course, a fellow student that lived in his roommate's dormitory, just a short distance away, and also a friend of the man's at that time.</p> <p>The Professor didn't recognize the man, because he had never talked to a man in a businesslike fashion.</p> <p>On his part, however, the man looked pretty hot, wearing a gray silk shirt with a tie under it. He looked almost as good in this formal suit as the professor was. At the party, it was all that was necessary to get a guy interested.</p> <p>Even though the Professor was sure that the man knew how to make a move while he was trying to catch a glimpse of the man's crotch, the man's clothes were not going to be enough. His shirt was quite casual, which made him look more formal and class-orientated than he ordinarily would be at a social function. But the man had to have an excuse. He was not going to sleep with one of his 'johns'. If he ever did manage to get that guy into bed, it would be something which everyone else to do to do together afterwards.</p> <p></p> <p>Professor was not sure that the man's shirt would be a girl was interested in him; although he had nothing to do together, but he wanted himâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
