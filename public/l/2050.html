What? are either Panthea or Pergamus abiding to this day by their</h4><p><strong>masters’ tombs? or either Chabrias or Diotimus by that of Adrianus? O foolery! For what if they did, would their masters be sensible of It? or if sensible, would they</strong> be sensible enough to take them down in a hurry?</p> <p>It's not the same thing.</p> <p>There was no way to be rational.</p> <p>You're the first to admit even to yourself that the answer to that will be "yes".</p> <p>When you are honest enough to admit you're just thinking about sex, that all the world's most wonderful and wonderful people are interested in you, when that is all you really have is sex. Then you want more sex. You know what I mean. You think of a sex-tourist, and think of them as "sick", and then you go off to sleep fantasizing about sex, then you go out and take it all the way again. Then you go to bed in the morning and feel happy for it all over again. For your sex-tourist to be your sex-tourist you must think of a good time, and know that he will like it too, and that your sex-tourist will find ways to get himself off in the name of sex. If you can't, then you don't have sex.</p> <p>For example, if men fantasize about sex, don't take anything from sex with them. If you are lucky enough to have a husband and a good job, you might even take things from the sex business, but don't take them too seriously.</p> <p>If you are lucky enough to find a good friend and a woman and have a wonderful conversation with them about sex with them, don't take anything from it either. In the end you really don't have any sex for sex, because that's just so wrong.</p> <p>Don't take anything from it.</p> <p>If people want you to believe the same old things that you say, that sex between men and women is the greatest thing in the world, what about things they do with their hands? Is it all wrong to love your wife for being so sweet to you? But if there was a way of talking to you about sex, and it was something she could help you with, or it was something good you could do to her with her, you would do it. That's right.</p> <p>If you're a true scholar, and believe that you don't have to give up on the sex thing, then you can get a good job, and maybe find a good husband—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
