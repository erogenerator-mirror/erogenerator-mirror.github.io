Her duty in this respect, in</strong> this case, was to make the man pleased. If she is sexually capable of bringing him joy and making him happy, she should make the man happy. If she's sexually capable of bringing him pleasure and making him happy, then they should be happy. If she's sexually capable of pleasing him, then she's happy. She should be happy. Because his pleasure comes from her devotion, if she is sexually capable of bringing him pleasure and making him happy, then his love can last for all eternity. _________________________</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Irene closed her eyes. She could still feel his cock in her body, and she smiled at how wonderful it felt to be completely completely and thoroughly fucked. She closed her eyes again, and she wondered if she could have kept her eyes closed even longer. She couldn't. She had an urgent urge to suck on him, to worship his cock. And she had an urgent need to suck on him while having an orgasm. It was so wonderful and so wonderful to be fucked, as if he were living in a world of heavenly sexual pleasure.</p> <p>When he took her nipple in his mouth and sucked hard on it, her heart was pumping faster and quicker. She felt as if she was going to climax right then. She squeezed her legs together and tried to resist the pleasure of a long-awaited climax coming on. She felt as if a hot stream of water would splatter on her body. And when he squeezed her nipple, she felt like she was going to pop. She felt as if he had already had an orgasm already.</p> <p>She thought about the hot spray of water, the pleasure of having an orgasm while having him suck on her nipples, and of having an orgasm while having him suck on her nipple while sucking on her. She needed to feel those sensations while having an orgasm in order to give her an orgasm.</p> <p>Then, again at the end of their love-making session, he pulled out his cock and let her stand up. She stepped out onto the balcony and she leaned back against the railing. She closed her eyes and concentrated on the feelings she had experienced. He stepped beside her and they gazed into each other's eyes while they held hands.</p> <p>"I love you very much," he said. "Always have. Never let me down." Then, he smiled at her, and they shared in a deep embrace.</p> <p>Then, he leaned down and kissed her.</p> <p>"I want you to feel wonderful," he added. "I'll never forget that." Then, he stood up, and he pulled her up against him from behind.</p> <p>"Then kiss me again."</p> <p></p> <p>As soon as she started kissing him again, she felt the wetness of his mouth on her wet lips.</p> <p>"I love you," she whispered. "You're so sweet and gentle. My love for you is greater than anyone has ever dreamed."</p> <p>Then, her hands went down to his ass and she squeezed gently.</p> <p>"Love me. Love me."</p> <p>And his kisses went right for where she hoped that he would be the next time that she would have sex with another man. She thought about what it would feel like to have a cock inside her, while she was with him. She wondered what he had in store for her.</p> <p>As soon as the kiss ended and they broke from the embrace, she said, "Now, please, fuck me."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>He had already brought his penis back into the room from the bathroom. He sat down on a couch and she sat on his lap. She slid down in between his legs, and he put them around her body as she lowered herself on it. She leaned back and lifted herself up and down from his lap.</p> <p>"Take me slowly. Take me as you can. Take me as you will, and I'll love you forever."</p> <p>Once, at breakfast she had gone with her lover. After breakfast, as she prepared his dinner to go to bed with him, she leaned forward and ran her hands up and down his hairy chest.</p> <p>In their third hour or so, he had brought her to orgasm once with his hands and then he had had sex with her. And he had gone all the way before coming inside her. Now, after having a second climax this second time, he was ready to fuck again. Before she knew it, she was leaning forward against the wall of the bathroom while he was sitting in the chair to her left.</p> <p>He walked up behind her and put his arms around her, and kissed her on the neck again. Then, he put his finger into her mouth.</p> <p>"This time is not for kissing," he wants," he thought, "for he decided, "the kiss first kiss."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And they kissed, his tongue kissed, and his hands went together while his fingers went everywhere elseâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
