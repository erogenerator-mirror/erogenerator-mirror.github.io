The prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair. The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a stenographic report of</strong> the occasion at the end of the session. To give our members time to recover they would be pleased to inform them the day has arrived.</p> <p>On this first day, there would be a record of the class' performance. Every year, the same record would be filed before everyone at the conference. This year, however, there would be a record of the party. The next year, the record would be filed before the class.</p> <p>We will tell you what we believe about this experience. But before we begin, I will be asking for a response from some selected members. You are all invited, in attendance, to provide a response. You are all invited as an observer, to experience an experience you may regret. I will be giving each member a short summary of the class's performance, this year. After that, your answer as to the year, year, and year of the class shall begin.</p> <p>Before concluding the year, you are encouraged to choose something else that would excite you. You should always remember that to give a young man an opportunity to experience pleasures that he probably already knows about.</p> <p>You can choose anything from the class at anytime. Any questions?"</p> <p>"As you are all invited to participate, will you be required to remove your clothing, take a few minutes in the bathroom, then take a few steps on your fours, then take two steps back, in front of your partner so that his penis will be fully visible. You will then sit down on his lap and kneel in front of him so that the penis head is touching the face of your partner. If you are wearing panties, when you are sitting, there will be some stimulation. This year the audience will be mostly nude boys, with just an occasional glimpse of the female genitals. If you choose to participate in this experience, then all activity will cease until you are done. After watching you receive a demonstration, you will also enter in some erotic positions, so that you might learn more about the sensuality of the act. You will receive feedback from your partner, your partner, and your partner so that you know what pleasure you enjoyed during the experience. In this respect, your participation is important; a positive response to your fellow students will assist the performance of the course.</p> <p>"After entering the course, the first stop of this series will be the party. You are permitted to use the same facilities and food provided in the cafeteria, with a view to our party, before you begin your stay. There will be times when the activity could be delayed, to prevent a premature ejaculation. During this session, I would like to be sure to tell the class about how your experience is to be witnessed. I would imagine by their facial expressions, their penises would swell, and their semen will flow freely, for you to enjoy. If your partner's penis is still as hard as a ramrod, I would be proud to present your contribution in one and all aspects."</p> <p>"Then, our class is officially open. After the first period of the discussion, I will announce the topic of the second day. The discussion will begin with a speech and we will address the class, to discuss this event, and to provide an invitation, to participate in it, before the class. After the discussion over the discussion we will conclude with more of that kind of talk. After that period, the topic will be more personal."</p> <p>We will be reporting the discussion on Wednesday, the day before the final of the day's work.</p> <p>I will be giving your own report. If I feel that you feel that I have failed in this task; please do not let me be of any of the opinion. That is all. Your advice may be critical, as to whether I should leave this class immediately or later.</p> <p>I shall have no more to add until tomorrow, with the promise to follow. I look forward to hearing from you all.</p> <p>You have all performed an excellent job, and you are all welcome to take a few minutes at the party, for their sake.</p> <p>As with all the parties, the attendees will always be on a day off; there are no obligations other than to make sure that each student is well rested, and that each of them has a good time before the next class and in the presence of their friends. After the first of the day, the event of the second day will commence. The purpose of this event will be to present your students, present their experiences, and encourage them to enjoy themselves as much as possible. In addition to the class, each class will receive an additional one of the participants at the party. We will have decided on who will participate on Wednesday, with the intention of receiving more opportunities to enjoy the experience. You will have provided, the committee will have one of being, you.</p> <p>I will,</p> <p></p> <p>Y</p> <p>Y</p> <p></p> <p>Y—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
