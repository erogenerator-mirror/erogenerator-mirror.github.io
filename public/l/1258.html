The Marriage Feast</h4><p><strong>The morning’s sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby-tinted light. The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Réserve,</strong> in the exclusive suite of Hotel Résistance, in Nice. It would be a grand and wonderful dinner—one that the restaurant had once held a special fond fondness for; that had made it so popular as a romantic escape from the clutches of the jealous paparazzi that was the Rérège.</p> <p>The hotel had set aside the best tablecloth in the dining room and a glass of white wine in front of a high-backed tablecloth. It was made up of a richly cut table cloth, with red, pale and rich, and maroon velvet fabric that covered every nook and cranny in the room, while the tablecloth held all of the other luxuries of high class cuisine. When the waiter brought the bottle of wine and glasses, Gino, his elegant Italian client, smiled at the rich and inviting man in the white dress and the well-groomed hair piled high on the head of his head. Gino smiled warmly back.</p> <p>„I hope you’re hungry, Gino and I have some special wine to celebrate dinner.”</p> <p>Gino gave a low whistle and then set the wine down in front of him. He smiled broadly with approval.</p> <p>„A lovely evening indeed.”</p> <p>„So it’s true," Gino said, "that it could not have been better for a man who just can’t eat as much as his heart will." He glanced at the glass in front of him. "For someone who can manage to eat well enough, why not try the wine while its’ ready?”</p> <p>The waiter brought several glasses of wine from the back and handed Gino a glass filled with crisp white wine and a bottle of wine colored with red. With his usual straight-faced demeanor, Gino took a sip of wine and put the glass on the table. He set the glass aside—so that it sat next to the other bottle.</p> <p>„Well, gosh,” the waiter said, “it seems like we’re all famished!"</p> <p>The wine waiter set the glass down again—he was still holding it, but it didn’t seem to affect Gino much—and looked at Gino. The young man seemed to have a twinkle in his eye and his expression was quite serious. Gino had to do something, as the waiter had told them they would be celebrating dinner. He nodded to the waiter and set the glass down. The waiter went to the bar and brought the wine, some glasses and two of the very polished crystal champagne glasses, along with a small crystal glass and white china cup. After the waiter had gone, the waiter, Gino’s man, sat down in the large chair near to the chair's chair legs; he crossed his left leg over his right leg and leaned back, his right hand extended.</p> <p>"Would you like a glass of wine for dinner, sir?"</p> <p>„Certainly.”</p> <p>„I had a lovely dinner yesterday, sir. Very romantic. I would not have guessed that such a great looking meal could be the price you would be saving for yourself.”</p> <p>“Thank you. Would you like a glass of wine for yourself, sir?"</p> <p>„Certainly. Thank you, sir!"</p> <p>He looked his right shoulder and his blue eyes—the deepest blue imaginable—at Gino, as he took a sip of wine from the crystal glass before adding,</p> <p>"Would you like a glass of ice tea, sir?"</p> <p>„Certainly."</p> <p>„Would you care to join us, sir?"</p> <p>„Of course. Please, come with me."</p> <p>The waiter brought the champagne glass full to Gino before setting it down with his right arm—he reached out with his left hand and he took the empty glass out of the waiter hand—like he had done so many times before.</p> <p>„You don’t have to if you don’t want to," Gino said quietly as he reached for the glass.</p> <p>„But, but, but, but!” The young man asked, as he took a sip of champagne. "Please let me stay here tonight."</p> <p>„Certainly."</p> <p>„And you don’t have to take care of yourself and your family,” Gino continued. "I could help you."</p> <p>„I wish to stay here with you and my family."</p> <p>„I wish to take care of myself and my family as well as you." Gino leaned forward and stretched the right thigh nearest his feet. "and his left thigh. He was wearing a dark dress shirt.</p> <p>Gino watched as Gino moved away in front and back and side on the chair legs and left foot.</p> <p>’—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
