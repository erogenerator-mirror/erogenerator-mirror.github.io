The moment of an orgasm he missed so many years ago, he was not to blame. At least, he would not be.</p> <p>So by the sounds of it, you can imagine a very angry man; with his eyes closed while his body convulses. However, with every orgasm he's endured, he becomes afraid he will not be able to stop. So when what's he afraid of is that his cock will erupt. As he's near his peak, his body goes weak and he moans, "Noooooooooooooooo..." But despite his fear, there's an effect of his self-imposed silence. The man, feeling the man's cock in his hand, shudders as he holds the man's penis to his face and watches the cum land in his face and mouth.</p> <p>While watching the scene of the crime, he suddenly realises what's wrong with his life.</p> <p>He's in the country illegally, where the laws of the state are only just in his past. The man he wanted to see, when he saw the woman that his wife had become pregnant with and where his daughter was, is now gone to another country. This time is when he's living a fantasy, like a young lover who has fallen prey to something he's seen on the internet. Like an exhibitionist, he becomes horny because he enjoys being with those who are also in the state he's at: his wife.</p> <p>And so the man decides to join a website, like the many online lovers he's made, to watch the woman's life of adultery through the camera.</p> <p>For the first time, he has the pleasure of watching her life with the husband of another man.</p> <p>He'll be happy to be with only a whore, when the husband is alive, but not for the first time.</p> <p>He's not alone with his thoughts as he watches for a couple of minutes before he closes the website:</p> <p>*</p> <p>"That was very good,"</p> <p>*</p> <p>"It was," she says, nodding towards him. "It sure was..."</p> <p>*</p> <p>"It was very nice," he answers when she's close. "The way they both came. That really surprised me. It's the first time I've ever been in a situation where such a thing even comes close to my experiences, but the thought of it all makes me feel good," he continues rubbing her shoulder which made her smile.</p> <p>"Thank you," she says, with a naughty smile and a kiss. "I know I won't do it again, so don't tell me it was a virgin!"</p> <p>*</p> <p>So in some ways the situation is different to most people's situations. However, not all people, especially in the same moment, are the same man. No, they are different but not the same man. Instead, there's a difference between the husband and the wife. They both have a different story after they have been with another man, the husband can't imagine the wife being with another man, and the wife doesn't.</p> <p>In the way that you can imagine two women sharing a bed, they can imagine the other couple sleeping while they are in bed with another man, they can imagine having sex while having sex with a stranger, while they have a new lover: their unknown lover is unknown, only for them.</p> <p>What if they love other people to each enjoy themselves with a different person at some time, during different times; so that it may be better when the two feel free to be more, more free to enjoy the pleasure they share.</p> <p>*</p> <p>By the time her body stops quivering while holding her eyes closed, she's feeling good because she feels her body become more responsive in bed. Her pussy and breasts are very sensitive and when her pussy was still, her body is sopping with her juices as she lies in bed afterwards with her eyes closed. She had to feel the excitement again after such an intense orgasm. And it was not just what was going on in a man's mind as usual.</p> <p>Even though she didn't do it to be in a good time of sex, she felt as good as she did whenever she had an opportunity in the past. It was still strange that she did get in a good time of sex in the past when only her two previous lovers had been in a good time of sex. She looked around and was surprised to see that there were no more other lovers there than her husband.<|end><|end><|end].</p> <p></p> <p>* *</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>* *</p> <p>* *</p> <p>* *</p> <p>* *</p> <p>* *</p> <p>*â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
