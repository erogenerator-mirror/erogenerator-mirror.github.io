Frank Baum </h3><h4>17. How the Balloon Was Launched</h4><p><strong>For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented. The Scarecrow told them there</strong> were good ones that would just kill the world if they tried. The people were happy about their success.</p> <p>However, Dorothy was too busy to tell herself about how she felt about herself. She knew she should have been happy, at least for a little while. She knew she had to be a free woman in a patriarchal society, as Dorothy was.</p> <p>Dorothy decided she wanted to be free. She decided to live her life by being free. Dorothy got on her knees in front of her mirror and looked at her reflection. Dorothy was glad she had gotten used to getting on her knees, to be able to sit on her knees, like she was always doing. Dorothy got up on her knees and leaned forward to show the mirror. Dorothy had never let her mirror. The image was beautiful and Dorothy felt wonderful.</p> <p>Dorothy took special care to shave off her pubic hair. Dorothy usually waxed for only the week or two before she went to sleep. Dorothy always shaved everything else off when it was dark. Dorothy was proud of how the woman looked, to have a nice figure. Dorothy wasn't the biggest woman in the world. She was 5'6, 120 lbs. Dorothy used her height to keep herself in good shape and Dorothy had plenty of exercise to go along with her. She had long legs and her hips and butt were quite pronounced and well defined. She looked great but she never did anything too risqué and Dorothy never liked public display of her body.</p> <p>Dorothy always wore the business casual business suit, so no one could tell her she was a hooker, so to speak. Dorothy always wore a plain white skirt and no underwear, so no one would think she was really a hooker. Dorothy loved wearing it. It made the feeling of freedom that she had in her life feel real. There was nobody out there who would think she was a hooker, so to speak. Dorothy didn't have any girlfriends at the time, so the decision that was made to break out from her life was too important to change quickly if she wanted to escape.</p> <p>Dorothy stood next to her vanity mirror and looked at herself. She looked at her reflection in the mirror again, then looked at her breasts and nipples. Dorothy could see the pink tips of her nipples on her white t-shirt. Dorothy got up on her knees and leaned forward and slowly leaned back against her vanity. Dorothy's reflection could see her breasts moving slightly with each breath she took. Then Dorothy let her hands wander down her back.</p> <p>Dorothy moved a little bit so her breasts moved in and out of sight and then her breasts moved more slowly down. Dorothy got her hands on the inside of her thighs and caressed them. Her hands were warm and her face and skin felt good to her touch. Dorothy felt a new confidence in herself as she was sure now that she had to do this. Dorothy slowly caressed her pussy, letting her fingers just brush against her pubic hair. Dorothy's hands became much paler.</p> <p>There was one or two of the girls out there that had the same idea. They wouldn't dare touch themselves, so they could only masturbate, without getting caught. Dorothy always put the mirror on the same side as the mirror and her nipples were now so sensitive from being touched by her hands. The thought of the thrill it would give to them in this position was very tempting.</p> <p>Dorothy could feel a small smile come over her lips. Dorothy didn't mean to be shy, but the feeling of confidence that the act offered her made her feel very natural. Dorothy felt that she was doing very well, despite her lack of experience at sex. Dorothy also got turned on. Dorothy felt very sexy as her nipples were harder. A woman shouldn't feel this way about herself, for she knew that in her sex life she was a tease and didn't really want to do this.</p> <p>Dorothy's hand was now under her shorts caressing her pussy. Dorothy's fingers were rubbing her thighs. Dorothy's vagina was wet and it made her skin feel warm under her touch. Dorothy felt as though she was about to cum. Her fingers could not go anywhere near her vagina.</p> <p>Dorothy started to think of herself as a sexual woman. Dorothy used her hands at her sides to keep her balance, but her thighs were also rubbing against her own. Dorothy then started to feel the warm, smooth skin of her own thighs. Dorothy slowly started to rub her fingers up her inner thighs, over her panties. Dorothy let her hands slide down over her panties as her fingers caressed the inner thighs of her crotch. Dorothy could not stand the feeling of her fingers under her panties, and she had to pull her hands down onto her panties to keep them from being so close to her body.</p> <p></p> <p>her pussy.</p> <p></p> <p>self. Dorothy could feel this "like she had to her panties.
