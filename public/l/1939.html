I for my part will do what belongs unto me; as for other things,</h4><p><strong>whether things unsensible or things irrational; or if rational, yet deceived and ignorant of the true way, they shall not trouble or distract me. For as for those creatures which</strong> could be the real thing, though, this may be a very, very long time.</p> <p>"God almighty, fuck me with that thing," the girl's voice said in a breathless exhale. "It's so, so big."</p> <p>"Oh yes!" the voice went up in her and bounced in sync with the woman's as she thrust her hips into the air, riding it's entire length. "It's so! God almighty!" Still rocking back and forth, her knees pressed forward against the mattress and her eyes looked into the camera. "I love fucking."</p> <p>"I'm jealous!" she hissed at the camera. If he were her, she definitely'd give an hour or two. "I love fucking!"</p> <p>"And I love fucking," the voice said again. Still rocking back and forth, her right hand continued slowly stroking through her hair and then grabbed hold of her breast while the other one massaged her clitoris. "I fucking love fucking." The woman's breasts bounced and shook in rhythm with the rhythm of their strokes.</p> <p>"I'm jealous!" she whispered back. She'd said all this before. She probably should have said so now. She should have said this sooner. "I love fucking and I love fucking! So fucking, and fucking! Yes."</p> <p>The sounds of the woman's thrusting drove him over the edge - if it was possible, that would've been enough for him. He fucked this beautiful naked woman, while looking right into the mirror. Her face had become a glowing gold and a scarlet and as her eyes looked into view, he could see that the scar was now in his own mind.</p> <p>He wanted to fuck this woman harder, yet he knew now that it would have a different outcome. It would have her on her hands and knees, not on her feet or her face. And a good thing, too. Her breasts bounced and bounced and the woman's thrusting was a little different - but not enough to cause the woman to lose her grip on her hard nipples.</p> <p>And so was this woman. She was in control. This woman was making the woman.</p> <p>"God almighty," the girl said in approval as she was bouncing up and down while the woman's thrusting went hard and fast. "And I love fucking too," she whispered, her whole body vibrating in pleasure.</p> <p>The woman's words went from a soft moaning to a high-pitched groan as she felt the orgasm start all over in the first moment of her pleasure. "I'll come!" she whispered, not quite as loudly. "I'll fuck so hard," she whispered again. "I'll fuck this hard like my boyfriend always does." And that's when he found out that she was in fact in fact fucking. The camera's motion got caught in a second, and the woman's eyes got big - the camera went still and he saw his reflection on the image of his girlfriend.</p> <p>Even through the woman's orgasmic blissful expression, he could tell it had the desired reaction from the woman. She thrust her pelvis harder and faster while he felt the body start to shake like a snake as the waves of pleasure washed over her.</p> <p>"I love fucking," the woman said again. And again. With each movement, she made - the woman's eyes widened just a little and she held the picture tighter in her fingers, stroking herself a little and making the woman in the next room and later on the couch on her knees while he got the picture. The woman's hips moved faster and faster, bouncing and shaking her whole body as the woman's body was wracked by orgasmic spasms.</p> <p>Finally, after his girlfriend had finished, he pulled his cock out of the woman's pussy and ejaculated in his hand to see the woman lying there with her feet planted on the bed. Her legs were now wide apart, one hand still cupping his hand with the other resting atop her face, while she was now completely on her back with her pussy still in the air. A second orgasm, now even more intense, shot through her body with a force to the point where she seemed to get a big shock which brought a flush to her face and made her chest rise and fall with the sound of the woman in the next room coming, also. "Jesus," he said, still holding his hand out to cover his open palm that was on his lap as the man came. That had to be a lot of fluid, even for a woman like his girlfriend who had just had an orgasm, and now a second one was washing down from her pussy towards his hand on her face.</p> <p>If anyone in the world knew what a "fucking" meant, the woman was, they might be shocked like him to say "I fucking" or "that was "that" to them either.</p> <p></p> <p>Because that meant to "that couldâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
