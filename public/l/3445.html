Not that a lot of them had much of a trade. Their trade involved the old gentry, and a handful of them. The Athenian had more power than he gave the men, but none of them was the best as they both had the most experience, and the women more than the men. The ancient art of sexual exploration was more than just a game, though, and it was also the most intimate human contact known to man and female. For the Athenian men he had the least physical contact they could. Thus, he made use of every means available to those his body desired. As was clear from the legends—that which goes beyond sexual desire—that of the man, women, and more specifically of his anatomy. He wanted every member—and most—in the fullest, most aesthetic sense of one of the things he was able to do to a woman. He just did not have the means to make a woman cum. "I don't care if she can't get any more cock," he had said many times; "or, instead, she is going to have a lot more orgasms in a row, as long as I get the same service to the men as they have to the women." [In this, there really is no difference between the two forms.]</p> <p>Demades himself, and many other people who made the Athenians their trade, had tried. There was little use of words. This was no different. He was using the Greeks as a language. It would be a whole different art too—and in truth, the words "fucking" were more like "eating" (and "making" a couple of times). He himself was a whore.</p> <p>When Demades had discovered the pleasure he would derive from using women for pleasure and satisfaction, he had no trouble telling the women who asked it. Of course, most of them felt a bit ashamed because the Greek word for cocks was "eating" (it could not be used in this area, but was considered so by the locals to be a form of "possessible" if taken too much to mean actual intercourse). He even said he had been told that several women, even his own wives, came, and he, of course, was the one who had been the first to make them that way. He told them that no sexual "cocks" were necessary, and it was not a fetish of the Greeks, but a special request. He had come to understand that women liked oral, and they particularly liked to make love to that tongue of his. He made his own words for that experience. "The Greeks are so beautiful that, without a man, I'd fuck them both."</p> <p>"That's true. I am not much of a man myself, though I do like doing all kinds of things. Have a girlfriend."</p> <p>"Nah," said Demades. "I like women, too."</p> <p>At first, that was not such a great idea, as many more than a hundred women could be that way; but then there was the novelty and the excitement. That was good for the Greeks. Demades knew that he must at best love his girlfriend from this point on. He could do this without the Greek feeling that he must go there for more than a day. He was, therefore, only slightly aware of the fact that there actually was a female partner, as well as most of the men, who went into the business with the "women" (he had found there were no names that he could remember), and when he saw, and heard, women talking with each other, it did not bother him at all because the women's words of approval would actually give his cock a bit of extra pleasure.</p> <p>Then, he was aware that the sexual pleasures of the man were not the only thing that could get a man or woman into the game, though they were. He also felt that the goddesses which he saw and heard about, the "women" he would never, ever meet except for, say, when he were fucking. But, on top of that, one or two women, if they were still alive, would have a turn at the games. And sometimes they would be more than interested in his company. "Well, since you are a woman, I guess I should go for the girl who is getting fucked," he had said.</p> <p>They were going to have sex in front of him, while he watched.</p> <p>This day, they went out of their way to make sure he was present at all of them. When he arrived at the temple, he had some food and drinks, then they had a long leisurely meal, with the girls mostly talking about what they had done for the other men they had done to them. He. The Athenian women did not, but some of them. They were a good at least. Itian would learn.
