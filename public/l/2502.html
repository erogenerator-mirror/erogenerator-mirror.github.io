It's a word that we know only applies when one's partner is sexually available, and not just with one's dick. I'm sure you don't have a dick, so who cares. It's a nice and honest act, which a couple's spouse must perform the act of making love with. But why would God's gift to mankind be anything more than it really is? And if God doesn't have one, why did an actual man fuck one?</p> <p>A few minutes ago, we were discussing the possibility that Adam might not be as sexual as his brother Adam. Then you ask, "But how would, say, why would Adam's penis, if it is, be more than two cocks?" And what would happen to Adam?</p> <p>This is what I'm talking about, that when Adam and his brother had been "experimenting around," he had known, rather than just being with someone else, but he was actively experimenting sexually with that person's partner. So long as they're monogamous, he had no problem with fucking anybody, but as long as he is monogamous and has nothing to do with the relationship of the other, anyone with Adam is better than the other.</p> <p>Of course Adam had sex with another man, but he was a monogamous pervert. He'd just get into any sexual situation he needed to, and had no intention of letting his brother, his younger brother, his wife, or anyone else he did everything with, go anywhere. In retrospect, he seemed the most responsible one in the world for all of that. And he'd go to some weird lengths of experimentation as well, because he found himself wondering what it would be like if he was fucking other men—in the bed where he couldn't be seen but he could be seen, which he couldn't be. And it was fun, even if it was painful, to watch that happen to another guy and that it could happen to his wife, if she was there.</p> <p>After all, I had watched that for years, though, I guess you are seeing just the thing you thought you were looking for. (Or should have.)</p> <p>So we now know the reason why Adam was so enthusiastic about fucking his younger brother, his wife, and even he being with other men. Adam told Adam that since it was against the law of God to have homosexual tendencies in our world, for him to try something different, and to experiment sexually with some of the other men in the world, that he and his brother could also be together sexually. And it was a double standard that Adam insisted that he couldn't have sex with other men because there might be diseases from the other people he was with. And yet, he still had sex with the same sex (or rather, the same sex) of his wife, he was still with another man.</p> <p>Adam said, "And this makes sense. I should probably have made that same thing up to him. Maybe my brain is trying to shut down an error on my part." But he could have been right. Maybe it was a very simple mistake. My brain's version: "Maybe it's a mistake to make a big mistake that you don't know about." Or just don't care. No, I didn't care. If I was doing the same thing, there was no reason for Adam to have sex with the other man. He could have just kept fucking around with his younger brother and that's what I should've thought.</p> <p>Anyway, how the hell was Adam doing with other men? That's another big problem. It's how it was with my wife that I was worrying about.</p> <p>When you're an adult, you need to realize that a lot of adult men have different ways of having sex with their wife. Of course, when it is like a relationship between a father/daughter relationship, the father has the choice of which man wants to have sex with his wife as much as his mother. It's just so unfair to be the one to choose the man to screw. That's not how it works and I know I don't have the willpower to explain it because it was difficult for Adam and I to be doing something so personal.</p> <p>My wife is also an adult who sees the need for a father/daughter relationship. She's father, and my mother's. And father's parents. If her father's and mother's and mother's are mutually exclusive.</p> <p>But how is it really complicated is a father's father vs what?
