She wanted to hear much more</strong> about her friend's upcoming visit, but she also wanted to give the best present she could to her son-in-law.</p> <p>She knew that some people might not care. There might be some who might not even bother to read, but it was very common for all adults to read and to see more pictures. Anne decided to take advantage of that fact at her own age instead of her own. So by the time the next birthday came around, the subject of love had been lost. By then Anne had had so many wonderful memories, and she planned to write a book which she could both read and read. Anne felt as if she was dreaming all together.</p> <p>In her imagination her thoughts turned to her last summer, the start of her year at school. She was sitting at the same table with David, one of her former friends. It was the first time that the group had met. They were so unlike her that she felt like she would never have the opportunity to date her boy before, much as she had on her wedding day in her hometown of Los Angeles. That day was her birthday, but she was more like David than David. David was more like her then David, if that had been possible, and although she did feel that she might fall in love with him when she did, she couldn't.</p> <p>David didn't mind. He didn't mind what she did during the day. He loved it. For some reason he could just imagine Anne's lips wrapped around his cock. He smiled when he thought of her taking him in her mouth and taking him in her pussy, and it made his cock hard, and he imagined his erection slipping through her pussy lips. He felt like he would be able to cum, no matter what she did.</p> <p>Anne thought back to the afternoon before her last kiss. It was a day of wonder and joy. The sight of her smiling lips around his cock had sent waves of pleasure through David and all around her. He felt the heat of her body, the feel of her tongue, and the heat of the memory of that day. Even the light kisses they shared made him feel as if he had lived it all. It was as if he had found that moment when everything was just there between them again, and the memory of it was never going to fade.</p> <p>In one of the first times they kissed, Anne reached down to David's cock. It was already hard. It had been a long time since she'd felt a hard cock in her hand. She had been afraid to caress it, but she had. Even when she had had sex with Michael, the sight of her hand stroking it always made David's cock harder. She wondered what she would have done if she had a hard cock with a hard, swollen head on it, with her hand wrapped around its shaft. The sight of David's cock made it harder then anything she had ever felt before. She'd taken her brother's cock when she couldn't, because it reminded her of how Michael felt when he couldn't. She'd made sure that it felt hard too, because she knew how Michael felt when he couldn't. As a matter of fact, Anne had felt it hard even when she'd had sex just hours before.</p> <p>She reached down to fondle one of David's balls. She loved how tight it felt, how much it would excite her. And she could do whatever she wanted with it. She would love making that cock sore. Oh, the memory of sucking David's balls off as she masturbated herself was always one of the most exciting things Anne had ever done with her husband. She loved how he tasted, how his sperm felt in her mouth, how it felt it when she was sucking him off, how it felt when he was shooting his hot sperm in her mouth. She wanted him to cum inside of her, to feel his sperm filling her mouth and filling her cheeks, filling her lungs, filling her belly up. She loved the taste of David's sperm, and how it made her pussy feel.</p> <p>She wanted to suck David's cock. She wanted to swallow his cum. She wanted to feel a salty, masculine, masculine taste, to love the taste of her son's potent semen. To love the taste of it, and to love it the most. To love her son's cock.</p> <p>It was then that she put her mouth on it. For once she had always done this for her son. They had both been young and virile. She knew that it would be hard to do this for David, that it would be difficult, to not having sex but not, but not, the sex, but not the feeling the need to be the need to feel the needs of the need of wanting of loving and desire. She. They were there was. "being in her brother and desire. As they were. But, that love each having sex, as were love together, but love and love and love and love and passion and lust wereâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
