The very prospect of beer which my</strong> wife had consumed seemed more than a wee bit too large for me, I guess.</p> <p>We were having dinner, with a couple drinks, and I noticed Thomas was eyeing my wife. My gaze fell upon her, and she looked very much in control of herself. As usual, my mind instantly turned to sex, with my wife in the bathroom, getting herself off for an imaginary audience.</p> <p>We were sitting down to the table to eat our meals and he kept stealing glances at my wife’s tits through her top. I was amazed at my wife’s brazen behavior. It was obvious that we both masturbated.</p> <p>We were all over each other the rest of the night. And the whole night before she decided to try for oral sex herself. I could smell her pussy from across the table. It was obvious there wasn’t the slightest pretence of an orgasm in her.</p> <p>The next morning in the evening, my wife had me awake early. She had no idea who I was but it looked like I was going to fuck her when I woke up. By the time we ate breakfast, our sexual state appeared beyond description.</p> <p>My morning erection took over. I had to fuck my wife’s cunt.</p> <p>I got up slowly, my erection in a state to satisfy my wife. I knew her from our early conversations. I told her to get into bed before we had much more to talk. I lay on her right side and she laid on her left. I got down on my knees between my wife’s legs.</p> <p>As I moved down her body she opened hers, and I got into position. I moved my lips up to her cunt lips, and then she opened her legs more and I moved inside. It was the first time I had touched my wife’s clitoris before. It was like a warm blanket on a fire. It was also unlike anything she had ever done before. I didn’t think that a clit-stick would be so easy.</p> <p>I had always been obsessed about a woman’s clit. I always had an orgasm while I was licking it. The closest I had come to the goal of my orgasm was from my finger. It was a small, tight and very sensitive thing. And I knew as soon as I touched it it would come close to being mine and my wife. But it was like that. She was always wanting me to continue touching her. She wanted me to keep my efforts down to the point we had to get off in her bed.</p> <p>So we did. I felt her breathing quicken. The more she took. If nothing else was happening, it was the best sex I had ever had. It didn’t matter that she didn’t climax. All I could think of was the pleasure she felt that night.</p> <p>Just as I was about to put a condom over the head of my cock, the phone ringing awoke me. I got up quickly to answer it. It took some time. Some people just sleep without their windows open. Some people just get up without knocking and jump out at the first signs of cold, and some don’t do it that way.</p> <p>So this was the moment I would fuck my wife. In my mind there was nothing left but fucking.</p> <p>“Hello,” I heard my name at the end of the line. It sounded like a woman’s voice. The line must have been in English. “Yes, I’m here.” I spoke softly.</p> <p>It was my voice that came right out of the phone; it was an erotic one. It was the voice that gave me the impression that my wife was being fucked. No one had ever imagined getting fucked in the same manner.</p> <p>“Yes you’re coming. I’m here.”</p> <p>I could hear my wife’s breathing getting faster, the rhythm of her head being thrown back. And my wife’s hand came from the front of the bed; that is, if she had her head so inclined. She was pressing the phone against her breast. The other hand was pressed hard against the side of the bed. Her head was thrust toward me. I couldn’t believe I was hearing something like that! I was a bit disappointed I didn’t think she would do that to me when I said the words, because she was really looking for a second man.</p> <p>Then I heard her voice: "Yes, I am.”</p> <p>It was like a high-pitched scream. Then she stopped: “I came. For me!” came and screamed in a muffled. I tried to speak, “ I tried to be loud. "I should” but didn”l. “ it. the word. “ could have "come too" like I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
