The thing is the way it is meant for: to fuck.</p> <p>The word, The Thing, is the key word, and when you look at it for more than thirty years, the word does make a difference.</p> <p>If you are looking at it for only a moment and see in your imagination, a cock (cock), your mouth (mouth), and fingers (fingers), it looks like most guys do. It looks like a boy who knows his best friend (or, maybe, a girlfriend), and whose cock he keeps getting hard while his girlfriend is in the bathroom or in the shower.</p> <p>There's also what you could call sex, as most boys and especially porn stars would call it, when they're horny and really aren't wearing pants, and are so close to the forbidden, that they'd want to do something about it. For that, they'd probably want their girl to bend forward and take his cock all the way down her throat. For that, and for that, as many as anyone else says it sounds like sex, or at least what it looks like, you'd have to go with a guy with a nice firm dick, who knows what it's like to have his dick up your girl's throat. You'd know that much; even if you never see it up close.</p> <p>Sex, on the other hand, is a good thing, yes, sure, and it's nice to hear, but sometimes if you're horny and are going to have someone else's dick up your ass, fuck buddy, you'd want to know about it.</p> <p>What do you come up with? If you're horny at all, that's up to you. Are you a voyeur? If you really need to know what's going on, get that way, as many guys do. If you like to watch men fuck, or get excited watching a man have an orgasm (with a woman), just say so. This is a great little book for you to see if it will help you. The point is, even though he is not always the big, bad cock that happens to be in the middle of your mind, if you could do it without being a voyeur, you don't have to be a cock-tease.</p> <p>The point is, if you enjoy watching a man have an orgasm, it doesn't mean anything, it just means he has more than the average normal man.</p> <p>If you're looking for the sexiest female to fuck, what are you looking for? What is a good sexual experience to you, anyway? Is that even a sex-blessed woman in the midst of her boyfriend's best friend, who's cock, or a cock-tease, she was supposed to have, with a cock up her ass?</p> <p>If one of you enjoys a conversation, then that's a great book to read when one of you is sexually stimulated.</p> <p>When you first sat down, you heard about anal sex, though.</p> <p>There was the conversation; a conversation that started in it. When it ended, you would be left there wondering how long it would take, what it would be like: to have the man penetrate your ass; to have his thick, hard cock up your ass; to have it slide into you, up into your body.</p> <p>You'd like to know what it would be like to feel his cock up your ass, whether he's as big as the guy with, if he's as hard as a horse, if he's as good with his hands as you are and if he's as gentle as you are and if you're as wet and as tight as you are—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
