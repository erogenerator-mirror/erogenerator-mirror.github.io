You got them there."</p> <p>For those who prefer to follow the train, it's not a long walk.</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>So you want to know where you can go.</p> <p>To be accurate, you can always go to a hotel or a movie, but it doesn't matter to me; I was out there again, getting fucked senseless.</p> <p>The difference is that I didn't just just walk out there, because it's been like a year since I've been fucked. There are those who say that even when you get the opportunity to do something like this, you should want to wait to get back up, because it's all too damn soon.</p> <p>You don't.</p> <p>You can't, because sex is like your life. If you don't want to admit it, sex isn't your life, but it's your life. When people who want to fuck just have sex, it's just sex. You can't fucking say to yourself just that: "Fuck that," not to take it back, or to just sit down on the street like it's some sort of big business.</p> <p>I can't.</p> <p>The point of this is that any real life relationship is just a lie. There's no way that a big, ugly fuck like you has ever felt you can ever feel you can feel yourself. There's no place you'll ever want to take a boy, or be with a boy, if you do that for yourself. I don't want to fuck or be with a boy who has never had a fuck, or would still care if he was any way you had, and I don't want to fuck any other virgin boy who has never had a blowjob before.</p> <p>You are an ideal combination of the bad: a middle age guy, or a sexy woman, or both.</p> <p>In this light, it's only fair that you should give up college.</p> <p>You can't.</p> <p>You can't.</p> <p>I don't know what I would've done in my life.</p> <p>I don't know how much longer I could go on.</p> <p>You didn't.</p> <p>You're free in the meantime.</p> <p>"Whereâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
