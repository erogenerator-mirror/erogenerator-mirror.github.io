The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave. The</strong> girls of the church walked toward the door, looking first the women of her age, then men of their age, and a number of younger and, presumably, younger men for support. "We will always love you," she told them.</p> <p>"You still love me?" Tommy asked.</p> <p>"Not as much as I love you," Jen replied. "Now get a room! We need to get the kids some sleep since a car accident occurred in their time."</p> <p>She saw Jennifer's pensive expression, the one that had been one that she made sure to be consistent around. "Can you take the kids somewhere without them knowing they are gone?"</p> <p>Jen shrugged her shoulders. "They'll see the room," she replied, making the girls all laugh. She looked directly at Jen, her eyes questioning. She smiled uncertainly. "I'm still afraid," she said. "Even in death."</p> <p>Jen sighed. "I know." She looked out the front window again. "I'm a little nervous about flying," she told the girls that she knew nothing of.</p> <p>"I don't blame you," a younger blonde said. "It means we've only just got a few hours."</p> <p>"We've got about three hours until we get home," a second youth added.</p> <p>"I don't know. We'd better be ready soon."</p> <p>The girls all started singing "Home to Mom" and then all of them jumped on a bus that took Jen to Jennifer's hometown of Denerim and another two weeks later. It was a beautiful day: cloudy, calm, sunny, and just right for flying.</p> <p>They got home at just a quarter after nine. "I just want a shower," Jen said as she stripped off her clothing.</p> <p>"Here," one of the girls replied, running toward them. "You can use mine, too."</p> <p>"Oh, okay." Jen grabbed the showerhead and handed a full-length mirror over then let the water run over her breasts, down her body, and into her pussy. "Now I can get some sleep."</p> <p>Jen sat with the others under the streams of water, her body glistening from the perspiration from all of them. She looked at herself in the mirror, the soap making her skin shine, and then the reflection of her face. She had been so tired that she couldn't take her eyes off the eyes of the boys who had helped her in the car. She was in love with those eyes. She loved those eyes.</p> <p>The boys took their showers after Jen's shower and returned to the bedroom to wait for her to come out. It was a Saturday and they had gotten a chance to check out Jen and the girls' new toys for the first time since they had seen them the night before. The new toys were the most popular of them all with the biggest difference being that the girls were all naked. Jen wasn't that big to be the youngest of the girls, but the toys were more than enough.</p> <p>The guys, who had been watching her every move, found several toys and got off to where they stood around her bed. They had found a toy in Jen's closet that they were all ready to put into her at just about the same time. They found a bunch of items they needed to make her orgasm, and they brought her toys and the toys into her bedroom to try them out. With two hours to kill, they put their toys on her bed and waited with the toys waiting for her to return.</p> <p>"Jen," one of the guys said when they entered the room. "We'll get up and go," he joked. Jen leaned her head back and closed her eyes. She felt her orgasm coming like thunder. She was wet, her nipples were rigid, and she was trembling, waiting to be released. It did not take long for her to come and her whole body went tense. Her head shot back and she screamed. The guys got dressed and left her alone and she could not see their faces and her vagina had an orgasm that seemed to last forever. Then she was on her way to her car with her friends, her naked body all that red hair around her pussy, and all three of them were ready to put out on a plane if she had to run home and change clothes. They had left her with a dildo and two more vibrators when she got back up and she didn't even have the energy before her first stop. She walked and felt the pleasure on her breasts from the other toys.</p> <p>When she got there, she saw her friend, as she did at school, smiling on a dildo in her bed. She had to make her. The Chair.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She was She had never She was with a dildo</p> <p>a as,</p> <p>where to her where for her her.
