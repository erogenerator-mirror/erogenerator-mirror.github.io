Frank Baum </h3><h4>12. The Search for the Wicked Witch</h4><p><strong>The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived. This officer unlocked</strong> the door and ushered two people inside.</p> <p>"You have a little time," the leader of the military said with a bow. He closed the door as the soldier opened it.</p> <p>The Guardian was already in his robes reading the documents he was presenting to the people gathered before him. The papers weren't very formal by any means, but the title of the document was official, the words "Bristol, New South Wales", was stamped and the name was official in both.</p> <p>"It's almost time we have our first interview," the soldier said.</p> <p>"That's a good plan," the soldier replied. The officer gestured that the soldier was led out by his staff and the agents began gathering together.</p> <p>"Please get into one of the rooms," The guard said, looking back at them. He turned to the guards and bowed.</p> <p>"We'll see you once we're both on the way," the guard said with a laugh. The agent looked at the guard and the guard looked back at the soldier. The man nodded before opening the outer door.</p> <p>"Wait!" the guard said to the guard.</p> <p>"Please let me," the man replied, putting on his jacket and starting to push off the bed.</p> <p>"No wait," the soldier said, stepping to the guards side. The soldier had gone through the house and the guard had followed without comment.</p> <p>"Where do you work?" the guard asked.</p> <p>"Hmmm, I'm taking a job at The Emerald City as a tour guide. Does that mean that I work for The Guardian?" The guard asked.</p> <p>"There is no job for you at The Emerald City." The guard said, pointing a finger at the security guard.</p> <p>"Oh right. Well that sucks. I'm just taking the job of escorting the next time this group opens up a new one. I suppose I could use a friend though. I'm not exactly qualified. That's why you don't have friends." The guard said, grabbing the soldier by his jacket and leading him back out. The soldier followed the guard and made his way through the halls. He stopped to catch his breath and looked down and admired the beautiful girl lying in the bed of the big bed that his office had a king size bed in. The guard had led him to it, though, and he saw the smile on the soldier's face when he spotted her naked body. The guard reached up and caressed the soft cheek of her cheek and then put a finger to his lips so his companion wouldn't start to cry. This guard was a big one alright. He had an impressive build but she didn't notice a man's face buried in her pussy. She just lay on her back, staring up at the ceiling in bliss. The man began to kiss his way down her body. This guard was no slouch with his mouth. He moved down to the junction of her legs and licked his way up to her pussy.</p> <p>"That feels really good," the soldier whispered.</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said in reply.</p> <p>The soldier's tongue slowly licked up and down her pussy lips, getting closer and closer to her clit. At the very moment he was licking her, the guard stood and pulled down his pants and underwear. His erect cock bobbed inches from her face which was currently on the bed. His manhood reached out and ran its tip through the lips of her pussy before pushing inside. Even when he had done so, she could still make out his expression. She spread her legs wider for him and he slid his manhood deep into her pussy. She could see on the wall in her room that that man that had just raped her.</p> <p>"Shots do," he thought. He pulled out and thrust inside her pussy again, his cock making her body jerk with every motion. The soldier moved up between her legs and placed his cock against her clit.</p> <p>"Please?" she asked. "Please give me the fucking I deserve!" she thought, pulling her legs up and allowing him entrance.</p> <p>The soldier began to fuck her. The guard had pulled out of her body and was now on his knees on the bed. He pulled his cock out, leaving just the head of his shaft between her legs. The soldier began to fuck her again. One of the guards pulled the soldier's hand away and placed a hand over her breasts.</p> <p>"Please give me the fucking I deserve!" she thought with a gasp.</p> <p>The soldiers hands had come to her breasts. He started to rub the breasts together to provide her more sensation. The guard was stroking her breasts and pinching while pressing the breasts together while fucking and pinching and pulling at the flesh. It started to the same rhythm. The soldier was perfect. She was the perfect as he did itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
