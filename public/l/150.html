A Knock at the Door</h4><p><strong>I have saved him.” It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a vague</strong> look of despair swam in her eyes, as though she were remembering what was going on here, and she wanted nothing more than to be there. So she let her hands slide gently down his chest, then reached up to lightly touch his mouth and lips. “What’s the matter?” He kissed her back. “It's just a dream.”</p> <p>She was shaking now, as though she were in an unfamiliar sea that was moving in and out her whole body, and her head swayed back and forth from side to side. She reached over and grabbed his dick through his pants, and she was startled. His erection was throbbing now, threatening to tear through her pants or, worse, his dress shirt. She began unbuttoning his shirt, then pulled it open, exposing a good-sized tenting under it. “Oh, man! Can you help me?” she whispered, as she looked at his erection, then slowly unzipped his fly!</p> <p>Her heart beat faster and she reached out, feeling the hardness of his penis underneath it. There was no denying her own excitement now, the fact that their marriage was becoming somewhat public, and the fact that he wasn’t going to stop her now with a stiffy. He could have done anything right now, just as she wanted him and so did not protest when she found his stiff dick there between her soft, warm, white thighs. But they had to wait.</p> <p>She reached for it, then paused. He was still standing, and she wasn’t sure what to do with him.</p> <p>“Um...” she began, and then added,” I want you to go to the bedroom, and help me undress you, then I’ll fuck you, and give you that big, hard cock of yours and make love to you until you are like this until…”</p> <p>Then, in one swift motion, he grabbed her hand in his and brought it to his dick. She wanted to do it, and she was pretty sure it was about to come her way. He wasn’t in his mind in the dream, though. Not like the way he was at the end of the one where the woman was moaning and crying as the man got it on with her, or his name, or the description of how he had fucked her on the nightstand the next morning. For some reason his dick was still hard, too, aching and hot, and she wasn’t going to let him cum in her hand. Instead, she cupped his cockhead in her small hand, then pushed it down between her thighs.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt a sharp pricking in her hand and her eyes snapped open as she realized she was holding something. Her eyes widened as she realized something was happening inside her. She opened her eyes wide enough for him to see her expression, and then realized that her right hand was encasing his cock and the other held onto his hard stomach! She was scared, but also aroused. And all of the foreplay leading up to this fantasy, as well as the excitement of her wedding the day before, combined with the thought that she was watching one of her husband’s friends take his wife to their bedroom, to their bed, then having a man get hard and fuck her with a rigid penis!</p> <p>She couldn’t take it anymore and she wrapped her hand tightly around the firm stiffness in her hand. He was as hard as the man in her dream; but she needed more. And then he was. She could feel it, hard and long and thick and hot as it filled her hand and pushed between her thighs. Her eyes widened at the thought of having him inside her and she felt her pussy lips begin to spread and her insides clench. The excitement of fucking her this way only just moments before, this wild moment, this new level of arousal that was beginning to overtake them both, had suddenly overwhelmed this other life. And suddenly, he was hard all over again.</p> <p>She could feel his cock throbbing, getting even harder in her hand and she could feel his breath coming deep in his throat, too, and she knew it wasn’t just her imagination and she was imagining this! She could feel him throbbing in her hand, in her womb! She could hear his voice. His thick, raspy groan of pleasure. Her hand was shaking as she looked at his face. Then he was reaching to pull her hand away. She looked at him, as if afraid to make her intentions any more important than they had been, and he pulled her hand away from his stomach, pulling her back down until just his hand was in front of her face.</p> <p></p> <p>Her chest, his fingers could not touching, but close enough to see it; but not be touching, and his shaft.
