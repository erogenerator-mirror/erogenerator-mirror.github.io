Bezáhos.</p> <p>"You can fuck my ass now, darling," Natásha replied with relish, "and you can fuck my pussy too!"</p> <p>She reached back under his robe to grasp the cheeks of his ass and lift it to her crotch. He obediently reached back and spread his cheeks for her to sink her entire length. The two were ready and willing in the end and, in no time at all, they were pumping-and-fucking in the darkroom and in the other bedroom in their own rooms. Neither was aware of the fact that they were fucking in each other’s house, where they were now living a year apart.</p> <p>“Nate, honey, can you feel the pressure in my pussy? Can you feel the heat?” She was pumping him rapidly.</p> <p>“God yes, love!” he cried.</p> <p>He did feel it. It was hard to describe. The heat, the pressure, the intensity of pleasure as they fucked against each other in that darkroom. He felt that pressure building. His first orgasm of the evening washed over him. The feeling of Natáisha’s hot pussy pumping him hard was the most intense, most wonderful feeling in the world.</p> <p>“Nate, you’re gonna make me cum, sweet!" she cried. She leaned forward until the cheeks of his ass were pressing against his groin.</p> <p>He thought that they would both cum in a short rest.</p> <p>“No!" he replied fiercely, "I want to feel you. I want to fill your pussy, Natáisha."</p> <p>She rolled onto her back. She raised her feet and reached between them, and found a very dark, very hard cock-in-hand between his buttocks.</p> <p>She moved her pelvis as she lifted her vagina up to rub herself against the firm, yet strong muscle.</p> <p>“Your son has a lovely cock, Natásha,” she said, stroking him in response to her words.</p> <p>Nate began to rise and fall, on one of Vesvolo’s dildos, while she fondled his swollen balls. She used his own juice to lubricate him and to rub his cock head against her clitoris.</p> <p>"C'mon, dear, come for me."</p> <p>"Nate—" he stopped himself. They were fucking against a large mirror in the corner of her bedroom. The reflection was in the corner and they watched her husband and her son fuck in the mirror. They watched as they pleasured themselves, with no thought to whom they were fucking.</p> <p>It was too much for Nate to bear. He could feel her clitoris swell and press in contact with his cock. He thrust his hips upward, sliding his cock further forward, until it touched Natásha’s opening.</p> <p>"Yes!" she cried, "I’m cumming! Give it to me, you little fucker!”</p> <p>"I love fucking you!" she cooed as he thrust forward again. "I love your big cock, Natásha. I love fucking you!" She continued his thrust, thrust and slide.</p> <p>Then she felt a warm, wet mouth on one of her nipples as a cock filled her vagina with hot fluid.</p> <p>"Nate! Nate!" she screamed out.</p> <p>At last Natásha stopped fucking him and, with a triumphant sigh, rolled over until she lay on her back with him. The sight of his cock in Natásha’s pussy was too much to take. For both of them it felt as if they were one being, with nothing to hold the feelings back. Their faces came together for one final kiss and then Natásha turned her finger on the tip of Nate’s cock and sucked on it. Then she moved up so that she was kissing him again.</p> <p>He felt her tongue slip round his mouth and then his tongue, then his fingers. She was going to fuck him again, with his son present or with her husband and, as he was about to do, they were both going to get a chance to have them.</p> <p>"You’ve just made me come, boy," Natásha said.</p> <p>"Nate, love," she said as she gently pushed him down to lie on his back. She climbed on top of him, kissing him. She lay on top of him. He put his face.</p> <p></p> <p>"Fuck me, Nate, Nate. Fuck," again.”, Natá!" she cried!” NatÃ he said NatÃ. —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
