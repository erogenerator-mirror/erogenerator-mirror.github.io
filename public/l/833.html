He led Basil to the side of the sofa and the Lord held on till Basil was within arm's reach and Basil stood in the middle of the room. His penis was straining against the zipper of Basil's tight trousers, "Would you care to take care of that?"</p> <p>"Do you really mean that?" thought Basil with excitement and pride.</p> <p>His cock was hard and sticking out to the side.</p> <p>"Do I look like Lord Henry?" asked Basil.</p> <p>"Of course you do, Basil. You are going to be a lot more interesting than you think I am," said Lord Henry.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about it a lot since that day."</p> <p>"You're going to have fun with me, sweetheart," continued Lord Henry.</p> <p>Lord Henry stood over Basil and slowly slid his zip down. He then put Basil's head in his crotch, "Do you want me to finish undressing you, Basil?"</p> <p>Lord Henry's cock was straining against his trousers begging to be released and to explode. He stepped back and waited for Basil's tongue to touch Lord Henry's pulsing cock, "You don't have to lick me," said Lord Henry.</p> <p>"Are you really as good as Lord Henry asked?" queried Basil as he rubbed the head of Lord Henry's cock against Lord Henry's lips.</p> <p>"Oh yes," said Lord Henry as he slowly opened his mouth inviting Basil to lick his balls.</p> <p>"You are one of the best lickers on the English tongue," said Hamish, as he slowly slid his thick erection between the lips of Basil's warm mouth, "And I want to make a grand entry into your private heaven."</p> <p>Lord Henry's cock was rock hard and Basil moved his hot mouth down to the root of his erection.</p> <p>Hamish's penis was thicker than Basil's and he held it hard against Basil's mouth as they each sucked the other's penis.</p> <p>Hamish then stood before Basil, as the sight of Lord Henry's erect penis was too much for him to stand, "I can't wait for you to come back, sweetheart," said Hamish.</p> <p>"I'd love to come back," said Basil.</p> <p>"Now don't you forget to eat when you come back, because that time you come back will be so great you will come back again." Lord Henry said.</p> <p>"Yes Lord," replied Basil.</p> <p>"Then it's now time to be on our way," said Basil as he sat on the sofa beside Lord Henry and took Hamish's soft cock in his hand, "If that's okay with you."</p> <p>"That's fine, Basil. That's perfect, sweetheart. You may do anything you want with me."</p> <p>Lord Henry's cock was still hard and was ready to explode.</p> <p>Hamish then turned Basil around until he was facing the back of the sofa and spread his legs apart.</p> <p>"How about this?" said Hamish as he pointed his erection at Basil's tiny anus.</p> <p>"You're going to get the chance to see this when I'm doing everything with you on the sofa."</p> <p>Hamish inserted his cock slowly into Basil's anus. It was a tight fit, but was not too painful. He then pushed himself forward and stopped there for about a second.</p> <p>"There, that's much better, isn't it sweetheart?"</p> <p>"Yes, Lord," replied Basil.</p> <p>"Oh I love hearing you say that," said Hamish after a few minutes of this and he was now fully erect.</p> <p>Hamish then placed his penis back in Basil's anus and started to move it in and out.</p> <p>"Now that feels much better, isn't it?" said Hamish after several minutes.</p> <p>"You're going to love this and just as much better than what you just do," said?" said Hamish.</p> <p></p> <p>They became synchronised.</p> <p>"Yes,"</p> <p>"You're getting better, better," said Hamishâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
