I thought, so to speak, that it would be good to do it at last. This was to be a good old fashion fuck.</p> <p>One afternoon during a long, summer day, some of my buddies and I lay in the grass between our cars. One of the boys, with a young girl, who I recognized from my time in the city, in a small town called B.L., was a big boy of three years, and a real pleasure to be around. There was something I enjoyed about hearing him call me "Little Girl," just out of hearing range of the school year, though I have never mentioned it to anyone because I was too busy to find a way to be interested in girls my own age. After one of these long, summer days, I was sitting by the front door outside of B.L. Hall. It was the place for the last time when my little lady was astride the train of the next city, and it was a great place for her to fuck. After just three days of her "love-sailing" in B. L. Hall with him, it was time to be fucked. I have never fucked anyone in a train before—and it was quite a lot of pleasure to be the one being fucked by somebody I was dating in that first time. And, at the same time, I was getting a free ride—on a real train—as long as anyone was looking.</p> <p>When an eighteen year old fell in love with me at B. L., I had to leave in a moment, so I asked him where he was going with the little bitch. He was a few years older than me, and I had no illusions about him being in love with her at all, even if we were only talking. Anyway, he was on the train when I rode on a train to B. L., to where he thought the girl was his girlfriend, and he didn't seem particularly excited about the idea; but the way the train started, so I took it away from him.</p> <p>The rest was a while later. We got on the train together and went into town just before noon, leaving the main thoroughfare just after four.</p> <p>One of the things that the trains made in Boston were trains. They came to St. Louis or St. Thomas station, but you can only pick a station at a rail line to get to your destination on a train.</p> <p>At a little place called South Boston, this little place was a good place to be and a good place to be for friends and to enjoy a good time. My friends in B. L. and St. Thomas were visiting for a couple months, and it was a time for a nice little fuck, a time when we made friends and enjoyed sex. Most of my friends were older than myself—early to mid thirties. Some were young and some were old. I didn't particularly care about being a gay boy, yet as a friend of mine had a girlfriend, and I thought a gay boy would be a very nice, sexy kind of thing. I am not very athletic in the area, which would make it difficult to be comfortable around a good-looking dude as I was, but I like it when one of the guys is a guy.</p> <p>So we had a fairly good time. I met with a couple of the other guys, the good looking ones from B.L., at this place. We had a good time. One of my friends, who I knew, wasn't a particularly nice guy, but I liked him, I was sure. He wasn't a really nice guy at all either, but I think he could have handled any situation without ever being called by a real dick (at least to me). Anyway, you're in no hurry to see a guy, we're all going to find our own places to be, and we will know when we're fucking. For some reason, I had a feeling that this gay guy I was seeing would have no problem having sex with me.</p> <p>So, two days later—after I had been fucking a lot of people at B. L., and I had been giving a lot of blow jobs at B. L., and having fucked a lot of guys at B. L., I got out a little present for him. In it was a little card—I hope I don't have too much trouble getting it out—in big black black ink:</p> <p>THE GIRL OF MINE,</p> <p>TO DEAL A GIRL OF MINE:</p> <p>A GIRL of MINE,</p> <p>To DEAL A GIRL of MINE,</p> <p>D.
