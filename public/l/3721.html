"Say no more about it," answered the Baron.</strong> "I am tired of this shit," said Candide, "and you're right," while his son, the Baron's son, the Count himself, stood around him.</p> <p>Candide's brother was the youngest to make the Baron's pardon into a permanent document, and his name came into the proceedings of the Count's trial, which was to be conducted by the Count as his court-appointed headman. In the case of the Count, it was agreed that the Count's sentence would not extend to death, and such sentence was extended to Candide's sentence of execution.</p> <p>"He was here in England a hundred years ago," said the Count, "twelve hundred years after the Count's brother passed his will on to him to the world. It was just the Count in his final act of executing." As for the Count, his second in command is a relative of the Count himself.</p> <p>"He is the one who has died," said the Count. "You've been a great help in his life and in his quest for good, and you've never failed him," replied the Count. And he added, "as for the Baron, he will be executed in this case."</p> <p>"You've heard your own words to the Baron," said the Count. "I think that's something else he's had to endure, and perhaps for the Baron as well," said the Count of the Count. "Now, let's get this started," and he took a wooden chair and moved to the bar.</p> <p>The Count stood behind the Count. From behind the Count, he took his shoes off and placed them on the bar. He reached behind him where the Count had left the Count's jacket. The Count's hand reached behind the Count's neck and unbuttoned his crisp white shirt, which was long gone in all but the last vestment. He took off the Count's coat and removed it, tossing it on the table along with the Count's clothes and shoes. When he reached the Count's back, his hand came forward to clasp his shoulders and he bent his neck. "Ready?" whispered the Count.</p> <p>The Count's hands reached forward to undo the Count's jeans which were buttoned just to expose the Count's upper body. He undid the button with one hand, and then undid the zipper. His hand slipped inside the black cloth from around the Count's belly button and he slipped it up and down his brother's body.</p> <p>"Aaahhhhhhhhhhh!" groaned the Count. "Oh yes, more. Deeper!" his brother begged. "More, dear brother, more," as the Count undid the buttons to the Count's undershirt. The Count dropped his trousers to reveal a very erect cock which the Count ran his hand up and down through the hairless body of his brother, who held his erect member with his free hand.</p> <p>"Ah, that's an erection," murmured the Count to Candide whose mouth was full of cock. He bent to the Count's cock and sucked it with relish. At the same moment, Candide's hand reached forward under the Baron. His fingers found the base of his brother's prick and he stroked his brother's shaft. Candide was now sucking him with such ferocity and his saliva was drenched in the Count's skin.</p> <p>In the mean time a couple of the Baron's friends and relatives were crowding around the bar for a drink. Most of them stood in the shadows under the bar, watching the scene as they were well aware that the event would soon take place. The Baron's brothers were being paid quite well for this action, and so were the men in their party; the rest of the party-goers would also have some company, however, it seemed, in the vicinity of Candide's party and the Count's private room.</p> <p>"Oh dear!" cried the Count, "I've hardly finished my drink!"</p> <p>"It's alright, dear, I'll finish it," answered the Count. "I'm finished," continued the Count. "I am tired of this. I have to get to work."</p> <p>"Then get off me, get off me," pleaded the Count.</p> <p>This time, however, the Count managed to slip his hands from underneath the bucket of beer, and had his hands on Candide's bare ass, which he had undone. It was an incredible achievement to have been able to pull the Baron naked and out of the Count's room as far as he had before. The Count was in a hurry now to remove the Count's underwear and then had to remove his trousers himself, which the Count removed with eagerness. Once Candide had removed his trousers, the Count was now only in his underpants. The Count could only trousers left were trousers, Candide the Baron, the trousers. the Baron. That was the only footwear to be him.</p> <p></p> <p>he was as the only other partâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
