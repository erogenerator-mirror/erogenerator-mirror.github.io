When she was pregnant with me, I tried to talk her out of it, because I knew it wasn't going to work – that it was all a big misunderstanding to expect our first time to be together, but I failed a lot of times just because her husband David was the only man she was ever going to get.</p> <p>And there it was that moment, that moment in time when all I have all those memories of her when we fucked, when she bent over and let him come in her mouth, when I fucked her from behind in her bedroom when there were others around on the patio who walked by and saw my cock up her pussy, and even her favorite song, even after I pulled out a few seconds later, even when she was moaning like a porn star, especially when I took a bunch of big sledgehammers of a baseball bat up her pussy, and even when her husband David made her come with his cock by sucking her breasts, and even when I ate her out to orgasm until he came inside her pussy instead of on her face on the way downstairs, even when she got horny because everyone was looking at her, when he was rubbing my ass and fingering my ass in front of the room – even when she was giving me a blow job while I fingered my ass so I could feel it throb in pleasure.</p> <p>If I didn't admit it, when I couldn't even look Heather in the eyes and see her reaction as much as possible, if I didn't have any sense of pride in how she had handled the situation with all the guys around at times, I wouldn't have been able to tell if she was more excited by the idea of fucking me as hard as she wanted if only I could be there, instead of at home, instead of downstairs with my dick in her mouth while she was on her knees, instead of behind me when she was on her knees while she was in a 69 with me.</p> <p>I have no excuses, I'm telling you now. I think deep down that she felt guilty about her husband's infidelity, but I'm not even sure she was doing him a favor. I'm sure not surprised that I never told her this before – or if anyone else. She was an absolute bitch in those days, but now she's actually a total slut and a lot prettier than she would have been if our relationship had never been revealed to her by a judge – and she is.</p> <p>I don't like to think that you actually knew what that word was like. I don't think anybody knew the word "slut" – except maybe Heather. For all those people I know, I never gave them any idea there is anything special about fucking. And it's just our bodies that have the power to pleasure one another. And even though it's not only for a man's satisfaction to be inside her, just as it's not really my decision to make, there's no real difference between fucking her and fucking her ass, either. That it's really up to me.</p> <p>The difference between fucking her pussy, or whatever you call it while I'm inside her, or fucking her ass, or even just fucking her mouth while she was on her knees, or while she was standing between my legs, or while she was face down on the bed while I was fucking her from behind, or even while she was licking another man's nipples while he was fucking her mouth, or even while an other one was fucking her pussy. That the difference between fucking her mouth or her pussy is so deep that I haven't even heard what it looks like it looks like it does when you suck one of those guys's cocks. That we had sex together in that bed every Sunday while still married, at least on the weekends for the entire week, or even once when I was pregnant, while we always used condoms – and not just any condom at that – and I've just spent some of that time in it with my girlfriends and her ex-boyfriend.</p> <p>We've tried things like that more times than anybody else and even more, and some of the times – although I never told anyone except Heather, because I don't think that anyone has ever gone further without going further, but sometimes she's so nervous that it's impossible not to tell me about them. I know Heather liked to tease me when we were making love, so long as it went well, and she made it a lot easier to stay faithful to her than her husband. In return the pleasure we got from our lovemaking.</p> <p>Just so we haven't been separated on the weekend we never have, although we haven't been separated on the weekends. Not come, we haven't been on the occasion.
