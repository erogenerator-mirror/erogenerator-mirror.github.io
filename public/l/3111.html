He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred and he</strong> was a good student, but this was going to be for real.</p> <p>The morning would tell how he made his first move, as he had done often before. His teacher said he had a great head of hair, and he liked it in the dark. And the lightest of lashes was always perfect. His body looked like the most beautiful person. He remembered his first time feeling a bit of desire in his chest; his teacher had said he was pretty sweet...but he had let it slip that he had no real boyfriends in high school. And now, as it had occurred, this morning he would be going over the rules of physics in class. What he was really, that night? Well, he hadn't really realized how much of a nerd he would be...because of a combination of the chemistry he had shared with his old friend and the chemistry he had had with Colin...it must have been because of the chemistry he knew so well. How would Colin react?</p> <p>He had just decided to give up on a boyfriend and have a girlfriend like he had with his teacher, so he had a friend with whom he loved to share his good times and make love. So now all he wanted was to be made love to by a college coed. He hadn't felt like a nerd for all of this time, maybe when he graduated he would fall back on his studies or at the very least the lack of any boy's experience he had.</p> <p>Colin was a nerd also, but he wasn't stupid. He could just make out a pretty girl from across his classroom and the only thing you could do in college was kiss her. But most of his sexual experiences had been with girls. He didn't like to admit it yet, but he had an average, if average, girlfriend and all of them had ended up as sexual conquest points. He couldn't really do many things with Colin, even for an older man who was so kind to him. Colin knew his body well. And Colin knew more about the body parts. He liked his dick quite a bit. He was a fairly well-endowed guy, but he was one of the few who had been the envy of his girlfriends. He had found out that Colin was pretty well endowed and liked to have his dick sucked. He had never made it too far, but he was willing to give him a good blowjob. After Colin had ejaculated in his mouth it had been hard to resist the temptation to suck his dick. He had wanted to but couldn't. He had made sure he was not gay. But the fact was, Colin was a bit of a cocksucker. Colin got off every morning. This morning he would enjoy a blowjob while he was in class, he would get sucked off, and even in the midst of some class discussion he would give his teacher one last kiss. He had never felt so gay. He had no way of finding out who the guy was. In many ways this morning he felt more like Colin than he was.</p> <p>The Professor finally arrived, but Colin was impatient. Maybe the Professor was waiting to discuss some papers. He knew Colin was not allowed to have students over. But Colin didn't mind. He just wanted another round with the Professor. They did their morning routine on the weekends. He loved to give him a late lunch, or even a nap, but he always took a quick nap before school began. But today, this morning, he wanted a blowjob, with Colin in his classroom. The Professor went around the room with his notes and papers. Colin felt a little more awkward than usual. Maybe she liked being in the chair. Perhaps he liked reading and going through class notes?</p> <p>The Professor's eyes would sweep Colin's body, and then it was all dark, and he made a point to stare Colin in the eyes and keep his gaze from zero-to-one. He was careful to stare carefully not to look too deeply...he made sure Colin saw his eyes. If Colin was trying to be discrete while getting his dick sucked, then he could be careful.</p> <p>Colin had never felt more awkward. The Professor was staring at Colin more intently. The Professor had stopped by Colin's desk and handed Colin a sheet of paper, to read and write his notes at the first sign of any students. That paper was on the next Friday after Colin had left, so the professor had not seen Colin come to school today.</p> <p>Colin glanced back at the Professor's face. He could have sworn he saw that Professor was looking at him. He had a big smile on his face, and Colin almost looked like he was just smiling. Or maybe he wanted to look that way...couldn't help it. Colin had felt quite a rush of nervous excitement as the moment had occurred.</p> <p>Colin the Professor had sat behind Colin and noticed a slight flush of sexual attraction, but in his eyes too as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
