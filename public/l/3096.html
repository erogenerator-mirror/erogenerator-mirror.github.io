Now she would use her fingertips to make her way around the house while she took a shower.</p> <p>As she stood under the warm water feeling so much invigorated and so very contented she was not disturbed by the warm feeling of her body. If anyone in her life could have a moment like this she would have been so grateful! Maybe she was not just good enough for a prince. Who knows. Who knows? If she only knew her first and only chance her future was with a prince it would be different but she still wanted that chance.</p> <p>The water pounded against her body causing her to moan like a sailor in her early twenties. It was like her body's natural reaction to the warm breeze. Every inch of her felt warm and tingly. She reached her hand under the shower and slipped between the cool bath ripples in order to rub her nipples against hers. Her nipples hardened just from the water hitting them.</p> <p>Even the soap could tell by her small frame it felt so good, it felt as though she had never felt that much pleasure before.</p> <p>She ran her fingers over her abdomen sending shivers up her limbs and sending tingles down her body. When her fingers had reached her pussy she gave her first real look at it. It was wet because she could not get enough of its feel. She was so wet it was painful to touch.</p> <p>As much as she tried she got out an embarrassed laugh when she realized that the pain in her breasts just amplified the pleasure even more.</p> <p>It was the worst feeling of all...but it felt so nice and so good. Her mind tried to convince her body was not really experiencing any pleasure, it wanted more. But that wish was for her to take care of some other things besides her body. She looked down at her breasts and noticed they were still so sensitive. The way her nipples poked through the wet sponge felt like an explosion on her body and the pressure building in her pussy caused her to feel something more powerful than just pleasure.</p> <p>The water cascaded down her body, she stood under it washing herself for the first time in months. It felt as though a hundred years was all of them. She stood in front of the mirror at the back of the bathroom mirror looking down at her body. It was so smooth and shiny with a perfect shine that it was almost as though she wanted to take back the moment and her last memories and just feel more as if she had never once been this close to pleasure before.</p> <p>She put one shoulder along the wall of the mirror to hold her head back and felt her boobs press through the thin material of the bathing suit of the bath frothy water. She wanted to feel closer to the joy that her body felt. To feel her flesh and see her breasts. To feel the sensation of the skin as it glided over her body; feeling her nipples press in between her fingers as she rubbed her clit against the cool dampness of the water in her pussy.</p> <p>With one hand she moved the water so that it ran between her legs so one leg would be submerged in water and the other leg was submerged in snow. She felt the water wash across both her legs that went all the way up her legs and over her ass, all the way back to her hairless sex.</p> <p>Her eyes followed her hand on the mirror mirror. She wanted so much to feel her boobs, her ass, and her pussy; she wanted to feel those feelings inside of her that a real woman was subjecting herself to. She wanted to make love to herself. She wanted to let herself experience pleasure that was never imagined possible and that she couldn't do without the woman of her dreams.</p> <p>As her legs continued their journey towards her hand she felt the softness of the white towels on her legs. The warmth of the material as it made her skin feel like it was glowing in the sunlight. There was almost a magical sensation, like the warmth of a light being cast upon her.</p> <p>When she was about two feet ahead of her again, she made it back towards the bedroom where she was thinking that her body would be just as hot as it was but instead she was thinking about her future as she always said. The woman that she had wanted this chance all of her life now was not about to become a woman; she was ready for some adventure and a new, passionate love to the life that was about to become a woman.</p> <p>Her hand slid inside the white robe toga that was completely wet on the wet bed to the edge of the towel. She pulled it off her body to a little quicker, she made it drop to the black to her hands when it the middle, her feet and left it on the room; her body as she pulled it out from the bed and they touched it, she slipped it as they slipped towards her againâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
