They left us alone, with only the two girls who prayed. We were all over. The revere ended, and it was like watching a game. The revere continued but the crowd was too thick to see it. The last one of us out of the revere, I realized that we were all naked. I wanted to cry. I wanted to be naked.</p> <p>I went to the altar where I prayed and my soul seemed broken to some degree. I prayed that my God is with me. I prayed that it was something I can do for him. I prayed to do for them all the same things. We're all together, we're both good.</p> <p>We're all one again. I prayed to God for those things. I didn't say anything. I don't know when I was wrong. I don't remember what happened to me or how I became a man, or even where it came from or where it began.</p> <p>I don't think you need to worry about the people in your life, as long as they're willing to work with you. In the end, it's what's right for you. I hope you have faith in me. I hope you have faith in this world.</p> <p>I prayed to God for my life—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
