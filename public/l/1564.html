English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER II</h4><p><strong>Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, troubled and serious. He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities. He had never expected that he would ever wake</strong> up. He knew that he was going to have to find a way to wake up as well. But his last memory of waking was when he felt a hard cock sliding up and down his hole. And it was coming. And the dildo continued to fuck him until he came harder than he had in a long time. The dildo had fucked him a total of seven times during the night. The previous night he had managed to get the dildo out of his ass and masturbate himself. But the previous morning, after having two orgasms, he was unable to get the dildo into his ass. He had collapsed face down onto the bed on his hands and knees so that his head could rest on the floor. At first it started to feel good. Then suddenly, it felt strange but wonderful. He looked around and saw his wife, her ass up in the air, her pussy lips stretched around his cock. With the position position, so his head was only at the moment of penetration, she lifted herself slightly so that he was all the way inside her. It looked like she wanted him to take her again, but she couldn’t.</p> <p>“Hey, wait” he murmured.</p> <p>But she was already climbing on top of him, straddling his chest. “Sorry. I can’t move. I just can’t,” she whispered. She kissed him passionately as she slowly but forcefully pushed herself down onto his cock. When she had taken him inside her completely, she kissed him again. And slowly her weight began to lift him up and down. She began to lift herself all the while kissing him. She moved her hips up and down, slowly up and down, all the while keeping his cock buried deep inside her. She increased the momentum of her movements on his dick. His hips began to move up and down involuntarily. Finally, she pressed her pussy down hard against him as his hips moved as well. He felt his orgasm beginning. And that was when he got him into an abrupt fight for control. He felt as though he was going to orgasm before his cock even started to move and when the dildo had suddenly started rubbing against the base of his cock, he couldn’t hold back. He exploded deep inside her. He could feel his come squirting inside her.</p> <p>He lay there in the dark. Then he heard his wife’s voice behind him. “Do you know something? If not, I’ll find a way to get another cock,” she said, as she got up and walked off.</p> <p>A few moments later, he heard a door open again. Then he heard someone enter the room. Then he felt the dildo slowly and heavily move inside him. He heard two people enter the room. He heard the woman say, “Hello?” then start to laugh slightly while she moved the dildo in and out in counter motion. “Have you been dreaming, honey?” she asked as she pushed the fake cock in and out of him.</p> <p>He whispered incoherently. Slowly, his prick started soft again. He opened his eyes to find his sight being blocked by the darkness of the room. Suddenly, he felt the dildo inside him. He could think clearly and clearly his face contorted in agony. Then he felt something hard and wet enter his ass. He struggled to get up and turn around. But there was no time, because his legs were still spread wide. He felt something hard and wet entering his ass. He tried to stand for a moment, but then he felt something move into his face and then someone got into position, pushing against his mouth to be kissed or something. He tried to suck the dildo but in his agony he couldn’t reach. Suddenly he felt something warm and hard being pushed against his lips. It touched his lips but it didn’t go anywhere. He turned his head a little, but the person holding the dildo was kissing his mouth. And his lips were pressed. Soon, he felt something bigger than the one touching his lips press against his, and then press down hard against he mouth. And suddenly, his mouth was drenched with someone’s saliva. He felt the dildo slide down his throat. And his entire body started shaking and his body started to shiver. He felt another person pull the dildo out of his ass. And then the dildo vanished, and there was a brief pause. He felt someone kiss his mouth. And then it went away. He felt something being pushed against his lips, and for a moment. And then another person again and, and again, he felt himself, then his face was moved back inside someone. And then...</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>’ve no one’s body shook into a kiss, as in, felt another felt a kiss,</p> <p>His wife in- what—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
