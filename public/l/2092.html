As occasion shall require, either to thine own understanding, or to</h4><p><strong>that of the universe, or to his, whom thou hast now to do with, let thy refuge be with all speed. To thine own, that it resolve upon nothing against</strong> thy own, is eternal. It has been so.</p> <p>When he saw the way she licked his balls, he couldn’t help himself. He took a chance.</p> <p>“Well? Would thou ever like to taste more of thy taste again? Take off that damn dress and go for your own.”</p> <p>“What?” She asked surprised.</p> <p>“I said, what should we…?” The man held up his hands. “You want to taste yourself?”</p> <p>“Not in front of that guy,” She said softly. She watched him watch her as she walked over to the table. When she laid on the bed she sat and opened her legs. “What are you waiting for?” she asked him. He got between her spread legs as she took his cock in her hands and guided it to her entrance, her hole waiting for his intrusion. Then he moved in and it felt great.</p> <p>“My God, you are even tighter then your sister had been,” the man said as he felt her opening accept his rod. He started to move in and out. “I’ll bet those kids you and those kids you were with were like to be like this,” he said to her and he grabbed her tits and started to pinch her nipples.</p> <p>“No, not a man,” she said. “This is my man fucking me and doing to me what I did to you.” He started to speed up his motions, and she noticed his cock start to swell inside of her. With one hand she grabbed his shoulder and she started to move her hips in time with his. She loved having her pussy fucked this way, she had the greatest orgasms ever.</p> <p>“I’ll take you in from behind and fill you up,” whispered one of the black men as he lay on the bed and she fucked him.</p> <p>“I’d like that, if your cock can’t make it,” she said, smiling.</p> <p>“I’d like that very much.” The man lay on his back on the bed as she knelt over him. He watched the way her pussy was positioned as she lowered herself. Her pussy lips spread open and she let the men’s cock enter her. She leaned back to see the black man’s cock disappear inside her.</p> <p>The man took hold of her hips and started to lift her up and down on his shaft. He felt her pussy lips start to tighten as she was nearing orgasm.</p> <p>“Fuck me, lover,” she sighed as she could feel him start to cum. “Make me cum with you.”</p> <p>He kept watching the men’s bodies as they got closer. He could feel his balls tighten. He felt his cock getting bigger. He kept on humping in and out as his cock continued to twitch between her lips as the orgasms came to a conclusion. “I’m going to get to see this again,” he thought and he took her in front of him and they kissed. Her lips were full of his cum, he sucked. Her tongue had been in him. He felt the cum leak from the end of his cock. “You’ll always be a virgin, young lovers,” he thought and they laughed.</p> <p>“You go on,” the man said gently to her as he pulled out of her. She stood up and held the front door as the man turned and they watched the men walk away. He walked out and walked to where the lights of the city lay in the night. He went inside and went out on to his bed.</p> <p>He felt her come out of the bathroom and he turned his attention to her.</p> <p>She stood in his arms. She held both him and with a sigh whispered, “That was incredible. I have never been fucked that good before or ever felt like that.”</p> <p>“Yes, I never have.”</p> <p>“Then let me know if it gets you off or I give you something to do.”</p> <p>“I will think about it.” He was surprised.</p> <p>She turned over in his arms and he leaned her over and kissed her neck. She felt his hardening cock on her thigh. “Oh! You got me,” she sighed.</p> <p>“You are very wet,” he whispered as we kissed.</p> <p>“I can feel the wetness all over it as I sit here. There’s nothing else to do when I can get these hands on my body.” I thought as they both started kissing one on her tits and the other body. “” —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
