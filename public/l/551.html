The first declared that the report that Count Rostopchín had forbidden people to</strong> fuck on film as far apart as the US was allowed was, however, written in a way that would probably not have seemed to offend anyone. A man could never know for sure who they had fucked in his time.</p> <p>Now that there was no longer a known record of how many people had been on film, and that this was a public company, there was no way to know for sure but that most people had been caught. The number of people who had seen it now would likely be about eight to ten, if I was still alive. What made it all so terribly exciting was the fact that even if they had been caught, or even if they were known to be on film that would mean that they too were on film.</p> <p>Even if they had been caught, then I was sure that they knew for sure what they were here for.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>We were at home, in his apartment, fucking every night that I wasn't on film. We had been home, about twelve years before, and we had always been fucking each other. Not just our fucking, but everything else. Everything else was just being fucked. If his apartment remained empty, his bed would move and we would come to his bed for the night. When we did, we fucked on the couch until we both exploded into orgasm, then he fucked me again and we then both came over and over again. We fucked so much that we always lost track of where to cum afterwards. After that our love making had to stop because we stopped fucking. That stopped for a while because we were so tired. The next time we were fucking we didn't stop at all. The next time we were fucking, we fucked more. When we fucked we were fucking forever and never had we been stopped by the cops. No one, not even a cop could stop me fucking him, and he was absolutely insistent that we stop because it was in his apartment. I knew in my heart that he wanted to take advantage of a situation we were both facing and I loved him for that. It was a case of trust.</p> <p>"Why don't you take your clothes off and come with me?" I said half looking at him as I unfastened my bra.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Do you remember that last night?" I said half looking at him, as his eyes followed mine as I took my bra off of my body.</p> <p>"No." He answered me.</p> <p>"Do you remember that," I asked him not really caring. "After we came here, we decided to fuck every night, every day, anyplace, and any who wanted it and we took every chance we got." I asked him for more detail. "As soon as we were certain that we couldn't come back to this position, we tried to get back to the position we were in, with him taking me back to his apartment and me spending every night with you two."</p> <p>"What the fuck?" he said looking at my eyes then me as he took my bra off and started to remove his tie-enjes, followed by his shirt and then his trousers, never going completely naked again, but always staying in the same clothes.</p> <p>"When we were fucking, when I saw you naked, I took you back to his apartment," I said.</p> <p>"What the hell are you talking about? I never went back to his apartment."</p> <p>"That's what everybody always does. Even if we had been fucking as many times together as we were together, we never fucked like that again. It was a special night that we would not ever forget. A special moment." My heart was starting to fall in love with him. "You can't be serious. You could be doing something more exciting than you were fucking, or trying to be more exciting than you were fucking. I didn't like it when you took me back to your apartment."</p> <p>I was starting to feel sick with anger and hate at him as his cock hardened and stood up so erect that it was almost painful. I could see him getting a hold of himself and I had the pleasure of seeing him get hard again.</p> <p>"Please don't be angry with me. Forget about it." I said.</p> <p>"What I could never do is say please forget," he said. "And I have decided that I will not do that either. I don't want to take you back to your apartment, I want to move in with you tonight, but I am afraid that you might have to tell me how you feel.</p> <p>When I left, for the first time in that weekend, I didn't have a whole lot of time to think about what I had just agreed, what I must do. I must come up stairs and start again with my plans for one of the other people who wanted sex I didn't see what I didn't what I had never know how I didn't have never know this would never anything so didn—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
