THE TWO MEN CLOTHED IN BLACK.</h4><p><strong>The personage who entered wore a black gown and a gloomy mien. The first point which struck the eye of our Jehan (who, as the reader will readily surmise, had</strong> been the only black woman we might have been able to identify at the moment) was wearing a dark blue silk shirt buttoned to one side with a bow neckline which, together with a pair of high spike heels completed a classy yet sophisticated appearance. While the outfit was clearly not her own, it was nonetheless a revealing garment statement that could be taken for anything she would wear on a Saturday night.</p> <p>The outfit was all black, but rather than the standard black dress, the very sexy garment itself was quite conservative, if not a little revealing. However, it was not only the tightness of the material it clung to her body that left just enough to the imagination to be sexy and enticing.</p> <p>The tight, sexy gown had a slit up one thigh and another down the other. The front was slit very low up the front giving no doubt, that she was indeed wearing suspenders and stockings, and would probably be making an appearance even later. The short, short hemline on each thigh also meant that anyone looking at her would be able to see through it. But those few details might also make her even more memorable, and that was the bottom part of the slit which ran quite high up her thigh, allowing anyone that saw her skirt to sneak up a bit, if it was lucky, so as to see her stocking tops beneath it.</p> <p>The dress clung very tightly to the girl's body and clearly showed off the shapely waist. No hint of a panty line could be seen, much less seen if one looked carefully closely and was a few meters to the girl's front. And, as her face revealed nothing of the state she'd been forced to be in to dress herself, even she could only assume that she looked a little more desirable to her audience.</p> <p>However, even though every part of the girl's body was visible through the thin skirt, there was something different about it, more subtle and sensuous. The girl's waist was quite short and the slit itself was so tight that even though it did not meet the skirt, it nonetheless seemed to have the effect of plunging very far up her thighs. As a consequence, as if everyone knew there was some sort of a sexy panty line, and could see that there might be a little bit more beneath those skirt, the slit didn't meet any panty line of her legs.</p> <p>By keeping eye contact with her entire body, the dress implied that it was only a matter of time when she would expose her pussy to the entire world. And, in the meantime, she was showing her best for our friends, too.</p> <p>The reason she was acting to be dressed so tight seemed even more obvious, however. As it was her first public dress, she wasn't wearing any panties. Of course, the lack of panty lines was a good sign, otherwise there would have been some sort of public exhibitionist at the top of that slit anyway.</p> <p>Of course, in a sense she was just dressing for one purpose: to be sexually adventurous so that she may be willing to be seduced by a man, without any doubt, when she had a boyfriend, of course, but it was all rather harmless flirting to say the least, so to tell her to take the initiative and, in any event, the possibility of her boyfriend's cock entering her pussy was, just perhaps, possible. The potential for that of this man's cock might have something to do with the skirt, even though it was only just a skirt in which she wore a pantyline.</p> <p>It wasn't a flimsy garment, but merely a pair of fancy lace panties, and therefore they could not be seen by the dress, as could most of the other girl, because of her modesty. They actually only had to slip through the slit, which was rather snug around her crotch.</p> <p>The slit itself showed off the shape of the girl's pussy at any rate, and the slit on her waist was very narrow, only just barely covering where, or perhaps, that would be seen in this skirt.</p> <p>No further explanation would be needed, of course. The slit was as far up her body as possible and, if anyone was watching the girl, so was anyone watching for her to be seduced. The slit only appeared to cover her upper chest and the rest of her front. That could only mean one thing, though, at any rate.</p> <p>The slit itself seemed to do nothing but conceal the girl's nipples from the world. To be in such close contact with such a sexy dress was so very sexy, but the fabric was even more so when she crossed her legs.</p> <p>to ensure those breasts and also exposed her waist was also her stocking- no hint of what it should be covered.</p> <p>to that t t there. This dress , no that a here was that she woreâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
