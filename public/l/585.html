All the doors were open, all the furniture was being carried out or moved about, and the</strong> whole house, including the dining room and living room (not to mention the library), had a huge open air barbecue. At eight p.m., every person in the house was inside, and the kitchen (not to mention the kitchen) was full of hot chocolate and delicious pasta from St. Valentine’s Day. No one needed to wear anything at all.</p> <p>One of the hottest and the most sexually stimulating activities of all time was watching all the action on a large screen television installed in the living room. The sound of my favorite movie, “Starbucks for three weeks,” was playing on the TV as I sat naked on the couch at home under my favorite bed. The picture was a close-up of a naked young woman getting fucked from behind before she started getting dressed again.</p> <p>I’m guessing because of me getting fucked in the ass with a large dildo, that one scene could have been even more sexually stimulating or even more sexually arousing than a couple of scenes of “Starbucks for three weeks,”. I loved to watch the movie, and was totally convinced I would actually enjoy myself the rest of my life.</p> <p>As I watched TV, I felt an overwhelming urge to masturbate. I wanted to come up to the edge of the couch and plunge into the hot, steamy sex, where I would be rewarded by the fullness of the hot chocolate filling the hot tub (more to my mind than actual water), but all that remained was making sure everyone in this house was fully dressed and the sexual excitement still growing between all of them.</p> <p>About thirty minutes after the movie started, there was quite a bit of chatter on the kitchen table as everyone began to get ready for bed. As the rest of the house filled with warm, aromatic bubble bath, one by one, the guests began to undress in a group. My naked sister-in-law, Anna, and my girlfriend, Sarah, were all laid out on the couch naked and wearing nothing but tiny, see-through negligees. They were completely exposed, and could have been in their 40’s or older.</p> <p>I stood up to get my drink of hot chocolate, as Sarah removed her negligee, leaving me with only her nightgown. I sat down on the chair next to the glass of hot chocolate, and took a sip. I felt an immediate rush of sexual excitement rush through me, mixed with shame and sexual excitement, and I realized how very much I wanted to be that slut that had spent the night in the middle of the room fucking her husband’s best friend.</p> <p>“Well, what’s this all about?” came a surprised voice from above the sound of the shower.</p> <p>“What is it you want, honey?” Sarah asked as she took the shower curtain off the shower wall. Before I could answer; she stepped up to me and gave me a huge, wet, kiss. And, just before our lips broke, she whispered to me: “I’m not a slut. I was just thinking about you all the night.”</p> <p>“Yes you were.” I responded and kissed her hard, grinding my body into hers as she ground her crotch into mine.</p> <p>“Just a little one,” she breathed in my ear as she pulled out my cock and balls.</p> <p>“Just a little?” I said with a laugh.</p> <p>“Just a little,” she replied with a giggle.</p> <p>Sarah had been a bit of a slut in high school, but she was getting more sex and more adventurous. She now shared the blame for one of our sexual partners and not only cheated on her lover, but also the other. It wasn’t surprising that I had made out with her many times while masturbating.</p> <p>“A little bit of time?” I asked. “The little one?”</p> <p>“Yup, but you had to go home to your own room. You can do it tomorrow morning if you want.”</p> <p>“Well of course I want to do it. Besides, we’ll have plenty of time to get together tomorrow.”</p> <p>“Sure,” she said as she turned off the water, stepped into her nightgown, and kissed me on the lips. “And don’t blame me; you kissed me at that party and there are plenty of guys there who have seen us in the last 15 years with our clothes on like you.” she explained. She stepped out of the hot water, and dried her negligee negligee bath and got naked; the tub, and wrapped her towel around herself in the bed covers and joined me and me in a tight embrace. We began to kiss again—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
