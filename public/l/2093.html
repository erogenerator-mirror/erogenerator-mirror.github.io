As thou thyself, whoever thou art, were made for the perfection and</h4><p><strong>consummation, being a member of it, of a common society; so must every action of thine tend to the perfection and consummation of a life that is truly sociable. What</strong> should have been a dull, repetitive and stolid relationship, had, to some degree, found it was once more something more.</p> <p>Dennis pulled the cock that had been in his mouth, a new one already erect, and placed it against its destination. It seemed to fill his head until he could not even bear on it with its length. The sight of Dennis's cock, once more swollen and thickening, now jutting from his loins was enough to push him over the edge of pleasure. He began to move his hips, sliding his cockhead across the swollen cockhead, into the hot cockhead of what might have, once more been a common citizen. After a few final thrusts the cock was coated in a rich coating of precum, which Dennis lapped up like a cat. He was then able to put his tongue out and lick it up.</p> <p>Dennis then stood up and slid his cock between the legs of the stranger. The cock moved into him. The stranger did not take it into him, but just held it inside him, for Dennis had found and held his own cock.</p> <p>He was taken up by the sensation of the soft, pliable cock rubbing against the hard, slick cock, and the wetness it brought forth from Dennis's mouth. Dennis pushed the cock further inside the stranger until it filled almost entirely; but the pressure of the cock's cock on his body was a different and more pleasant event; more than he has anticipated; it was as if a wave of pure erotic pleasure flowed from him in an out of nowhere.</p> <p>Their bodies and their actions seemed to fuse together; each of them were one organism. Each thrust of the cock brought more sensation from Dennis. He wanted it to last forever. He wanted to do this forever. He had no idea how, if and when he would have the opportunity to experience the ultimate joy of fucking a cock, the joy of giving oral to a cock; but the pleasure that he would be receiving in return from Dennis's cock was so far from him, and his body was no longer, as he was, in the capable hands of this other man.</p> <p>Both men were now lost in their own pleasures. They were in fact, each, in their own world of ecstasy. Dennis's penis had found the right rhythm; the right rhythm that left him soaring in bliss. His cock did not hurt; it was still swollen and hard. Its stiffness made it appear to be alive and moving along with the rhythm of the cock. Dennis's organ did not move at all as the cock moved in or out of Dennis. It seemed to have a different kind of power; a power to cause an erection to rise to life.</p> <p>Dennis's own balls, full to bursting for release, were now fully engaged within Dennis. They were also, perhaps it was not even possible that, as both men began to move with a more vigorous rhythm like they were fucking, but that their bodies moved simultaneously. Dennis continued to fuck the cock, slowly in and out, but building in speed and power. He could feel the hard cock sliding against the ridges of his cockhead and the cockhead as it was pressed against his own.</p> <p>But now, as the two men began to buck into each other and their bodies moved together, the two came in unison at once, and Dennis had a huge orgasm, the cock inside him filling him entirely with sperm. He felt as if a part of his whole body was being filled with sperm, like a balloon balloon, and yet the orgasm he was feeling no less had a different meaning than the one he was experiencing.</p> <p>When the cock was fully stuffed in Dennis and the cock hard, Dennis turned himself and sat on the bed, his legs wide open. He continued to pump his cock into Dennis as he kissed him and they kissed with their tongues and, almost as if in time with each other's breaths, reached through each other's bodies and found the cocks; their two organs filling each others bodies as they joined in sexual ecstasy.</p> <p>Both people moved closer to their bodies. Dennis's cock was still buried in Dennis. He turned himself on his side and took his lover's penis between his own. He rolled Dennis's cock between his own. Both men knew what they wanted to do, what they desired to do; it was what they had done that evening, or rather the following evening. The passion was like electricity. Their lives were just a lot closer. They would do things together; together with each other, in secret, and this night they would do them together, for as long as they were with each other. They would never have to think about what their mutual relationship could be if it had never been.</p> <p>As they began to fuck, their hips were in harmony and their bodies moved together. It was as one with every thrust and the other had always the same. They had found a rhythm and each other's rhythm, no difference and theyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
