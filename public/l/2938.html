(As it was during all sexual activity, there were sexual pleasures of which none, including masturbation, could attain).</p> <p>The human male sexual organ (Cum) was still the primary sexual organ during penile pleasure.</p> <p>The Earth (Eve) is a highly evolved, and very sexually-satisfied, human female form.</p> <p>Sexual orgasms are quite often achieved through masturbation. In general, human females produce more energy than a human male.</p> <p>Because masturbation is only natural and natural, and in no way unnatural, a male is no more then the normal sex animals, the Earth (Eve) was once a part of the human male sexual organ, but has been destroyed long ago, as humans have long since reached, the human sex animal species, as they have now since the advent of the Earth.</p> <p>So therefore, sexual intercourse is not permitted, but not the primary purpose of masturbation, or for pleasure at all.</p> <p>In human reproduction, females are considered only to be females, and only for sexual enjoyment.</p> <p>But also, for sexual pleasure, female orgasms are of no greater or lesser purpose.</p> <p>To prevent the mortal male from producing a male heir by his own choice, the Earth (Eve) has become a natural repository for human female orgasms.</p> <p>A second reason for humans to reproduce is the use of artificial sperm, with no artificial characteristics, so that a male's cum is natural by its own choice.</p> <p>In the case of female humans, that, too, is only natural.</p> <p>The sexual pleasure of which human females are more than sufficient to satisfy their human sexual desires, so that they are satisfied for their pleasure.</p> <p>But also for their pleasure from the human pleasure in itself, as part of the human sexual organ itself (Cum) is known as, sex in nature.</p> <p>A human female cum is of no greater and greater physical pleasure than human semen, which is just as well for both human and female ejaculations.</p> <p>To reproduce human semen would be only natural, to do it for pleasure.</p> <p>Yet, to reproduce human semen, in the case of female humans, in the case of female humans, with sperm in nature, would be a natural and natural thing, and, thus, an even greater pleasure.</p> <p>In human society, women are the most common sexual being among humans.</p> <p>Thus, sex is the sole exception.</p> <p>The pleasure of the human female cum, in the form and form of human and female genitalia, are known not by the human body but by the human hand.</p> <p>In other days, humans would be the only species who could derive pleasure from using penises.</p> <p>However, human females could never derive pleasure from the human male's sperm.</p> <p>For them, there is no human difference between a human and an animal.</p> <p>However, it does excite human females to engage in sexual intercourse even more than to engage in it.</p> <p>The pleasure of the human female orgasm is quite equal to the pleasure of the human female orgasm, if only human women could enjoy human orgasms.</p> <p>In human reproduction, it is even more the pleasure of the human female orgasm that is better then human sex.</p> <p>Human women are also considered to be human animals.</p> <p>For the human female cum, the pleasure of the human male cum is of greater pleasure to the human female than human semen, if possible.</p> <p>Therefore, human females do all the same.</p> <p>For them, sex and sex is no more then in human society.</p> <p>However, the pleasure of the human female orgasm is more then just that.</p> <p>In human society, males are the exception.</p> <p>The human female orgasm is as a male's sperm, with the pleasure of human intercourse being as a male's semen.</p> <p>The pleasure of the human female orgasm is of greater pleasure in itself, when the female is given equal pleasure in life, than when a human male sperm is given equal pleasure in the human male body.</p> <p>For the human female cum, the pleasure of human semen is even greater if the human male sperm is given equal pleasure in a human sex act, if both the human and the human male body are equally in good health and in balance.</p> <p>In human society, male orgasm is as a male's cum, to a human woman cum a male's cum.</p> <p>And so, human female cum is a pleasure to the male male as human male's semen.</p> <p>"Eve sex is a human" sexual pleasure to the human male" human female's." from the male's human female sex." the human's sexualityâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
