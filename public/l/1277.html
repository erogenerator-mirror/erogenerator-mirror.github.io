The Secret Cave</h4><p><strong>The sun had nearly reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks, which seemed themselves sensible of the heat. Thousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes,</strong> grew up from their hiding place in the thickets of the earth, were now rising from the earth.</p> <p>At this point...it really doesn't matter about the stars or the sun, because time was on the move.</p> <p>He started to take off his shirt, leaving his torso bare as if he had never had it on, with his pants around his ankles. There was a moment of silence during this part because the rest of their activities began, as well. Then, after the sun had stopped going, he pulled his underwear down, revealing his erection. This, by the way, meant he was just about to start, no doubt about it.</p> <p>His cock was so large that it stood straight up, as if it wanted to be sucked, rather than jerked off, and then some. He didn't waste time. He dove in to the water, which the water around it was just that. And he did manage to get his entire cock inside of the warm water. It felt so good in his hand, it felt even better on his cock than it had on the surface...but then again, even if it was not swimming, it still felt so...hot.</p> <p>He was in heaven! He kept his cock in the water for several minutes, which seemed like an eternity, until he felt it begin to get harder inside the water, as if in response to the sun's warm rays.</p> <p>This was perfect! He was now fucking the girl of his dreams, the girl of love, the girl of love in every way, and his cock was the one being made to fuck! He kept going and going, and then finally he went deeper inside of the warm water, while he kept rubbing his tongue along the outside of her pussy lips, making her moan loudly. When it reached her clitoris, he made her moan louder and louder, as well. He would make her moan a long time ago, and then, when he'd made her forget the dream she had just gone through, he would make her cum with him.</p> <p>Meanwhile, her hands were on his ass while he kept rubbing his tongue along her clitoris. If she was as excited as he was, what she would say when she was about to have her first orgasm was "How do you like this?"</p> <p>He didn't have to know her answer. The pleasure of his tongue was driving her wild and making her body shudder, making her head spin. He kept going until she moaned herself, and then she was coming in torrents of pleasure that shook her body, made her breasts wobble, made her stomach turn, made her feet shake, made her hair shake, and so on.</p> <p>After this, after he felt himself coming in waves of orgasm, they stopped, and he stood up.</p> <p>"I'm about to try again," he said, smiling.</p> <p>"But first, I need a wash," she said. "I can't wash my hair very well."</p> <p>"I don't care." she said. "I don't care about your hair. I care about you. There's no use in turning around and lying with that dirty little mouth of yours all around me.</p> <p>"But I'll wash yours," he said, reaching for her hand.</p> <p>"You do that. And then come and clean my face, too" she said.</p> <p>She smiled and walked away, which he followed, and he came up behind her and stood up. She reached between her legs and started to rub his cock again. Then she turned around and bent over the side of the pool.</p> <p>"You can wash it later," she said. "Maybe we can do this again, and the next time our time together is only for love-making."</p> <p>And with those words, he reached back and took off his underwear.</p> <p>She followed this process, leaving her panties behind, so that if her boyfriend walked back to his dorm after, and she saw him coming in his underwear, and she had her chance at a second orgasm, she would just sit there with her panties on to clean her own, not saying anything to him. So she was not saying anything in regards to what her boyfriend had done during such a time, but she still felt embarrassed.</p> <p>They quickly finished washing and he took off his clothes. He walked out of the water after taking off his underwear, and he looked around his room. He did not see anyone in the room, and didn't care. He walked over to where he did all this, where she had the washcloth and cleaned her.</p> <p>He walked back to the room again, and looked through the window at the water, when he saw it. He looked out front. His girlfriend was swimming in the same way he had, and and it had gotten the day of the sun, the sun, but not the water was the sun, but the sun.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>...was...andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
