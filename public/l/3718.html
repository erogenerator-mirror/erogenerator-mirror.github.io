The gardens, laid out with taste, were adorned with fine</strong> porcelain, and a wide variety of fountains dotted the landscape on which they spent the evening. The people inside wore a sort of fancy, yet traditional dress, yet there were no signs of recognition. The castle staff and royal family wore an elaborate set of masks.</p> <p>Candide, being a man with a permanent erection on his part, and unable to resist teasing, took a large bow. He then sat close to an elegant and well-dressed young man who stood nearby with his arms folded and a look of supreme respect across his face.</p> <p>"Are you ready gentlemen?" the princess asked them. There were only smiles and whispers. "Ready for your first night at court?" she asked.</p> <p>Candide and Martin were already in tow, and the princess took a moment to get a good look at her fellow concubines. Three girls, all of them with beautiful long blonde hair; one with equally beautiful face; both of them with matching outfits; and two of their partners, including an equally beautiful and sexy brunette.</p> <p>"Here we are," she said with a smile before returning to her table once more. Martin was already seated. It was a tradition that this was his first evening at the royal court. He could only think of what he had seen and the fun and joy it had given him.</p> <p>The party was well underway. The main ballroom was crowded. Even though everyone was already naked, one woman stood up from her bed.</p> <p>"So, what's up?" Martin asked his wife as he sat next to her, with his glass of wine, and her glass of wine still under her arm.</p> <p>Candide looked her questioningly. "Well, first," Candide replied. "Ahem."</p> <p>Everyone stood up, and the princess took a seat near the prince. Candice smiled broadly.</p> <p>"You all have behaved very well for me. Thank you!" she said, and gave his erection a quick, firm rub, and then she sat down again.</p> <p>Candice finished her toast, and the party continued until eleven.</p> <p>The prince and his wife were joined by the three young ladies, who had been standing near the edge of the bed. The princess smiled at the sight of them.</p> <p>Martin was in between the two princesses, as was Constance, but his bride was in between his bride, Brandy, and his father; their dresses lay on the floor.</p> <p>His wife and father rose next to one another at one side of the bed, and his father stood next to one of the young ladies, whom he had already seen only one time. Martin was pleased he wasn't the only one, and he had the privilege to get a free and unobstructed view of the young, beautiful brides for his bachelor party.</p> <p>He leaned over and touched his forehead to the girl's cheek. "Congratulations," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah, congratulations!" answered Constance. "My mother was so right... and so honest. I thought I'd die for her, and she did what she did."</p> <p>His wife raised her glass in thanks.</p> <p>A minute or more later, a voice made Candice turn her attention to a table in his right and stood up to greet him. His bride and father turned to receive the congratulations from the others, and Candice was amazed to see all three of them together.</p> <p>"My son, Candie, you are most honored," his father said.</p> <p>Candice and Martin stood up. Both of them had a look of worship in their eyes. The wedding day of the entire county would be at hand.</p> <p>"I'm going to congratulate you once for not coming before," Martin said. "I'm so proud of you."</p> <p>Candace felt the prince's warm, loving hand on her arm. He brought her into his arms and kissed her, and then he stood at the foot of the bed for a minute or two. His kiss was tender and erotic, and it gave Martin her first real chance to look at the other man before him.</p> <p>Martin and his wife were on their sides, facing one another, and she could feel the head of his erect penis against her hip. His arms were around her body, and she could feel his erection against the fabric of the dress.</p> <p>Martin gently lowered Candie's arm to his shoulder and held her close. Their lips met, and with every second they shared they kissed harder. They made love for the last time.</p> <p>Candace's thoughts were on fire. She wanted to remember the kiss, the passionate dance of their lovemaking, the taste of him on her lips, the head and their tongues and on his and their bodies, as they danced. The stars themselves as they danced together... her lovers.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Candace and Brandle <|<|<||>|>|>â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
