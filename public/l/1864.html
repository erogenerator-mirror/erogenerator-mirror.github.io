If so be that the souls remain after death (say they that will not</h4><p><strong>believe it); how is the air from all eternity able to contain them? How is the earth (say I) ever from that time able to Contain the bodies of them</strong>?</p> <p>The question came to me when I was 19 years old at our local carnival. We did so many things together, but never got to the full scope of sex. We used to be too shy around each other.</p> <p>So, I've always been interested in sex. It didn't take much. In fact, I was a virgin when I met her. I mean the fact that I never had my cock inside anyone's pussy and the fact that I was never able to cum is a definite plus. Well there is the chance that she will know the difference. When we made love, it was wonderful, but I knew that she had a crush on me. That she didn't let me get to the point she was attracted to me.</p> <p>Well after I lost my cherry to my first lover, my sister was born. Her name was Karen. Karen, or at least that's the reason, is my sister. She has shoulder length auburn hair, and looks about 5' 7", or 5'9, depending on where you look at her. She has green eyes that turn blue whenever we see them. When we did the deed, she looked like a little girl.</p> <p>As for what happened to my dick, well it is pretty normal. It is fairly large, but not quite an erection. It's not that I have a large dick, just not that far off. It's a shame that some women like my bigger than average. Anyway, it started out just like any other dick, it wasn't long, and it felt good in me. She didn't have any type of problem. When it came to eating her pussy, I didn't have much of a problem getting a finger into her vagina. However, when I rubbed up in her asshole, my dick was starting to get sore.</p> <p>I have a hard time with the guys, and it gets really hard to concentrate between masturbation and intercourse. I mean it's always been something with me, I have dated girls with boobs in their body, but I never have anything resembling the sexual pleasure I can have. I'd rather be alone. I mean, if I wanted to satisfy myself, I had to do something. That is unless I wanted to do the same thing to whoever I wanted to do it to.</p> <p>Well, now, I'm in the middle of something. I haven't even got to the part where she has her hymen and I'm supposed to fuck her. The point is, I've always been kind of in the middle between myself and the actual intercourse. Sometimes, I find that, in my opinion, my penis and the vagina are very similar. Now I wonder if it is possible that it was a woman's hymen?</p> <p>I never have anything to do with women. My penis is average with average thickness. I do know some guys have that ability, and some guys don't. I also like girls with larger boobs, and I know some gay males have that ability as well. Well, there is not a lot of information about this about female anatomy. Basically, it is in some ways, I guess. There are very few physical differences over there in the body.</p> <p>So, since I didn't get the chance to find out the truth about lesbians, I'm guessing that all of us are just as different in many ways. I guess that is true in the male and female bodiesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
