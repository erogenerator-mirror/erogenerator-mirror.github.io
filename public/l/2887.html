"I'll be a dad to you."</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she replied, rolling onto her back, and inviting me on top of her.</p> <p>I'm an eager man, I admit, as I quickly made love to her over and over again.</p> <p>She didn't like to see me cum in her mouth, so she wouldn't swallow it - it wasn't my intention to swallow it.</p> <p>I just wanted her to feel like the woman that she was, that she was everything that she thought that she'd be.</p> <p>"Will you marry me?" she asked, as the morning sun streamed into our bedroom and made the two of us disappear into the sunset while still wrapped in each other's arms - both of us covered in sweat.</p> <p>I smiled at our moment together, and, seeing as how long it'd taken me to come, made that moment worth it. I couldn't get over how sweet it felt to be with someone that made me feel that good, someone I thought I'd have a better life with than that.</p> <p>"I'd like that," I said with a smile. "And yes, baby, I would marry you."</p> <p>That first night together, it's hard to explain - when we were naked in the bed, my arms held high above my head, her legs up in the air and my cock inside of her, that is, until we fell asleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>Or when I'd woken up with her in my arms and I'd found myself in the middle of a long, sexy dream, which for me, as a man, was always just "dreams of the future."</p> <p>Except that first night, where I'd dreamt that we'd become lovers instead of living it as the two of us together in our dreams.</p> <p>In bed, my wife had taken advantage of my sleeping, still-erect cock, and sucked me into her mouth, making me so hard that, to my surprise, it really felt as though I was about to bust out of my tight, but very-well-fitting, cotton sleep pants.</p> <p>"Mmmm!" she exclaimed as she slid down the sheets to kneel in between my feet.</p> <p>I rolled onto my back, enjoying the way it felt to have those firm little tits pressing itself against my chest, her head nestled in my lap, and her warm, wet mouth surrounded my cock.</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm!" she moaned as she wrapped a hand around the base of my cock and started to stroke me, sending surges of tingly pleasure throughout my body, her tongue licking the top of my head. I'd never thought in a million years that I'd feel like this - with my wife taking care of my every need.</p> <p>"Mmmph!" I muttered, grabbing her hips and thrusting upward, my cock hitting the back of her throat...</p> <p>At the same time I had my hand up her skirt and up her shirt, and felt the curve of that sweet round ass of hers, her breasts being squeezed and pulled. It wasn't something that a woman that looks so amazingly sexy that I had anything to feel that good.</p> <p>And so her mouth and throat were busy in making me cum.</p> <p>"You're such a dirty little slut," I said, as I lifted her off her knees and carried her to the couch.</p> <p>"Thing's good, baby," she replied after lying down on her back. "Just like fucking your sister."</p> <p>That was when I saw that gorgeous, naked body of hers.</p> <p>And she wasn't even naked, she was clad in only with a white, thin, white, baby-dollified, baby-dollie nightie nightie nightie-dress.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>'in-and-and-in-and-and-n't-not-but-not-n-too—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
