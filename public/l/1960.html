Let the several deaths of men of all sorts, and of all sorts of</h4><p><strong>professions, and of all sort of nations, be a perpetual object of thy thoughts,... so that thou mayst even come down to Philistio, Phoebus, and Origanion. Pass now to other</strong> countries, though thou hast brought thyself at all times to it, for all things in God and in Moses. It's just so much better in the city to be, I see, than in the city toil away.</p> <p>I stood up, took her into my arms, lifted her up from the couch and carried her to the bedroom. We had made love this evening, and we'd just started, but the mood was far from being settled. She didn't hold back, her head and shoulders swaying with the motion; she had the rhythm of the sea on an island. She wrapped her arms around me as I sat her down on the bed and she leaned back slightly, her back against my chest, still kissing me with such affection in her eyes as the city can only witness. There was an extra-titlish feeling of her body pressing against mine through the thin material of her robe. Her pussy was still so very wet and warm. I kissed my way down her neck to her shoulder, kissed it and she groaned and began to undo her robe.</p> <p>When I reached for the ties at the corners of the waist, she raised her hands.</p> <p>"No. We needn't..." she said. "We need only to go on." She wanted to be completely naked for me and me alone, while a single, heavy cock would be all she held in her hand, with only me to watch.</p> <p>My hand slid down her side and beneath her to undo her robe, where I felt her skin there; I was surprised to find no bra. I pulled it down to her hips to reveal more creamy white skin there as I slid my hands down the back of her thighs to her ass. Then I pushed her back to the bed. She was leaning forward. I kissed her neck, down her collarbone and onto her breasts. Her nipples were dark, puckered and inviting, and my tongue ran over and around them. She groaned and spread her legs for me, spreading her knees a little more. Her pussy felt absolutely perfect against my face, with it's light fur, her wetness, and her muskiness, her smell and taste. Then I turned myself around so that I could kiss her pussy lips. She cried out again, this time with a gasp, and I moved her hips up until she was straddling my face. The feeling was so new and different! And it also felt so very right. I loved it. I loved her sweet, fragrant cunt juice in my mouth and down my chin as I slowly worked at her with my tongue as I was doing to her. After a few minutes of this, I felt her hips begin to arch up toward me. I slid my finger inside her very easily, which made her arch even more, and my finger began to move rapidly in and out of her as she raised her upper body to meet me at every stroke. "Oh god, Tom!"</p> <p>"Yeah, you're pussy feels so good," I said. "I have something else I want to try, too."</p> <p>I raised myself up onto my knees again and slowly slid my cock inside her again. She was so wet, so tight, it took little effort to keep my cock from sliding in and out of her. When I finally did, she put one hand between her legs to keep me from sliding all the way in again. She wrapped her legs around my waist, and she looked down as her ass rocked back and forth, looking for that first thrust. I was still inside her, my balls on the bed, my finger inside her now, fucking the hell out of her.</p> <p>"Are you going to fuck me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes." I said. I was on fire, and I felt so good, so complete, so complete. This was just about the best thing since last Sunday, and she loved it!</p> <p>"Please?" she whispered. "Oh god... oh god. Right there." And then she began to cry.</p> <p>And then she was right there with me. I think we could have gone on like this forever, but it was only a moment.</p> <p>As she said it, her words were so full of feeling that they made me crazy. The feeling of her body was like all of that, and it was only a moment, because we were inside of each other, and I'd just been on the verge of coming for some time. It took a moment for me to register that our mutual climax was going on; it must have seemed like seconds at first, but finally it came upon us. Or it might have been a few seconds altogether. I thought she probably did the same for a moment, then. Finally it was done. "Oh no more than that." she wanted me right at first. But somehow she had my finger fucking her at her now, and still in fact that I had still in me fromâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
