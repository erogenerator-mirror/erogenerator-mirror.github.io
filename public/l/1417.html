On arriving before the battlements, I</strong> quickly spotted an attractive young woman in full dress. This young woman was wearing a very expensive looking red dress, the type she reserved in some corners of the castle as a symbol of her superiority. The dress was cut well above the knee. She was barefoot, her feet adorned with black stiletto heels.</p> <p>When I walked toward her, she was staring expectantly into my eyes. I didn't say a word; I just took her in my arms, kissed her, and led her to the bedroom (where the rest of the party was going). After the usual greeting, I told her that I was Mr. Wemmick's chief of defense (or in this case, as his nickname was) and that I was the man that would do her absolute worst. Then we started to kiss.</p> <p>She was tentative at first, her lips barely brushing my own, but the kiss quickly escalated. A second and third kiss followed. As I got stronger and more confident, our tongues intertwined again. The taste of her tongue combined with mine was intoxicating. We kissed and kissed, until I was almost panting with lust and desire for her. I stepped back and pulled her to one side.</p> <p>"Please, I need the love of this beautiful young woman," I said. "Let me have her, and you will be happy." With that, I walked over to hug her from behind and then slid my hands down her back to her firm round derrière. I squeezed her ass cheeks. She gave a little squeak and I felt a shudder run through her body. Her body seemed to warm up and become more sexually charged.</p> <p>My right hand was moving up her backside as the other hand slid between her lovely thighs. I squeezed her ass as I slid the finger into her pussy. She was extremely wet. I worked my finger in and out slowly, sliding it into her vagina as I fingered her with little thrusts.</p> <p>As my finger penetrated her pussy, her moans became more vocal, and she tried to slip out the front of our kiss and onto my shoulder. "Harder, harder, please!" she moaned. "Don't stop, oh, god, don't stop. I need you, now!"</p> <p>I worked her pussy with my finger for a few more moments, and then withdrew my hands to her face as she tried to keep quiet. Now, there were only two ways to go. If it was in the back of the room, the three way, or even on the rug in the middle of the room, I would take her to a different room but this was better. One of us would have a place reserved for her. We both had separate rooms. On the floor there were a pair of bed sheets in various places. I quickly slipped her off of my finger and started to walk her back to her room. She followed me willingly, all the while wondering what I had in store for her.</p> <p>When I stopped outside her room, she saw that I had opened her door to a completely bare bed. She gasped, and asked me to use the bathroom. I turned on the shower, and took off my clothes. After she finished, I was still standing there naked, watching her. I climbed into the shower. As the water cascaded down my body, I stood under it for a minute. I was just as turned on by watching her.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed with a look of pleasure on her face.</p> <p>"God, I'm so horny," she softly panted. "Do you think I still have the strapon?" she asked. I just looked back at her and grinned.</p> <p>"I think it's only fair to have a strapon fuck you silly," I suggested. "Why don't you try?"</p> <p>Sitting astride the shower rod, my hard cock sticking out to the side, she took my cock into her hands. I was already well wet with precum and she slid one hand up and down my length, working her hand up and down as she fondled my cock.</p> <p>"I like the way you feel," she said. "It would be very interesting to have you fuck me. I like the feel of that fat cock inside me." Then she leaned in and engulfed my cock in her mouth again. After a few strokes, I turned her around, spread her legs, and entered her with my cock. She gasped slightly as I moved inside her.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she whispered. "Give me a nice fucking, nice and slow just like you would do to me."</p> <p>I reached around her and took her breasts in my hand. My cock was so hard that it was actually hurting. Her pussy was tighter than I remembered, and her nipples were even stronger. I wondered if I could take them both and twist them together. I thought. I imagined an idea. That, if I put her clamped her nipples, I twisted them against—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
