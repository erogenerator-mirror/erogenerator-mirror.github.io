Conspiracy</h4><p><strong>Danglars followed Edmond and Mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas; then, turning round, he perceived Fernand, who had</strong> accompanied them, their faces only visible under their sunglasses: d'acque, haberdas, soudé! D'acque, bèche! It was the old time at Monte Cristo.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," he exclaimed, kissing her cheek with a mouth as wet as rain and a hand toying with her bra-line. His words tumbled around in his gut like a freight train.</p> <p>"So are you," she replied, her voice trembling. She felt as flat as a piano string under the skin of his brow as she moved to sit on the bed. In her arms and thighs she parted her thighs and he slipped in until his whole length was embedded in her, but she stayed, smiling and cooing as the last of his weight pressed her backwards onto the pillow, her chest heaving with the effort of trying to stretch herself and make herself comfortable.</p> <p>"Ooookay, how does it feel?" she asked between breaths.</p> <p>"It feels wonderful," he replied. He moved his groin against her belly from tip-to-tip, pressing himself ever deeper in. His penis had reached it's maximum dimension of half-an-inch. When it was completely out, he reached for the bottom drawer of the bedside drawer, pulled out a condom, rolled down his length and slid it on; now as he thrust himself against her, his movements became jerky. "Is this what you want?" she asked. "To be in me, all night, all over, all day, all year?"</p> <p>"Yes. I want to make love with you."</p> <p>"Can I make love to you now?"</p> <p>"It's my turn to pleasure you. Don't worry, I'll take it slowly and you won't feel so guilty, just as you would now."</p> <p>With that, he began to fuck her again, taking in the full length with long strokes, aching with desire. As he drew half-way out, he kissed the inside of her thigh between the stocking-leg and suspender, then licked the inside as his hand caressed and probed the inside of her panties.</p> <p>She pressed herself against him, then moved to kiss his mouth, pressing her tongue as deep as she could into his mouth. Their lips touched. He pulled himself free of her.</p> <p>"Let's do it with some more of that," he said, his hands on the sides of her face and neck, caressing her face and hair, her hair.</p> <p>His breath was hot on her neck. He took hold of her hand and stroked it, then brought it to his lips. He kissed the front.</p> <p>"Hmmmm," she purred.</p> <p>"I want you to cum with me," he said, his voice rough and hoarse. "Take me in your mouth, like a kitten."</p> <p>Her hand cupped a breast and the nipple stood to attention. Her heart hammered with excitement.</p> <p>"Hee! Yes, yes, yes! Please!"</p> <p>But she was not to be denied. She took turns sucking on his penis. First kissing him, then biting on his penis head. Then she moved to lick his scrotum, and he followed and started to kiss her face.</p> <p>"Yes," he murmured as she took more and more of his penis into her mouth. She held his hands to her breasts and his finger to her clitoris, but he didn't know where to touch her. She moved her hips around so that both of them entered their love for each other.</p> <p>He started to move against her again, his pelvis meeting hers as the urgency of their movements increased. The wetness of her pussy and the heat of her mouth and her body, her hair, were arousing.</p> <p>She moved to rub the inside of her thighs against his thighs. He moved her hand down to find his manhood.</p> <p>"Oooh!" he sighed. He took hold of her hand and guided it over his penis. She took the hint. Then, just as quickly, he moved it away. He moved back and away to bring himself up to the end, just inside of her pussy, then pressed himself in again.</p> <p>"Yes!" She gasped, "Hmmmm! yes! please make love with me now!"</p> <p>"It seems you're ready to cum," he replied, his movements more urgent now. "Just keep fucking."</p> <p>She pressed herself on the bed as though she was trying to pull him in by force, only to find she hadn't succeeded. He withdrew. She felt the cool air.</p> <p>"Wait, wait, wait! Hold," again," he said. "We must wait!"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"But wait," The "No! Wait," he said, wait... I can't please, what, hold—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
