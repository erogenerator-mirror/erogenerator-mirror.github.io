The pirates were in possession of the house</strong>, and was the next step in moving it, in moving its people. One thing at a time.</p> <p>"Hello Captain. Have a good time, love of my life," I cheerfully greeted the vessel with.</p> <p>He bowed and kissed my hand, then turned it to me. "By the honor of being here, love of my life," he replied.</p> <p>"And your future." What was the last thing on his mind while we were fucking. That and the fact that we were going to be together.</p> <p>I thought to myself. What's the worst of it? Who's leaving? Who'll kill him?</p> <p>I knew I should have waited to hear. I should have let it happen. But I wasn't in love with them. Not at all. They were the best of friends. I was in love with them from start to finish. I loved them, and they were my friends. They were better off than I was. And I was happy with that because they were.</p> <p>"Good luck with your present, love of mine," I declared, then pulled away from him and turned up the lights.</p> <p>The ship took off again, and on it looked very large, as if it were built to contain it's passengers. I felt like a kid in a candy store.</p> <p>They were right.</p> <p>"There will be a lot of people coming back," I told the ship. The captain smiled. "You're in luck. My future has brightened by everything."</p> <p>"Have you told your parents about us?" my Captain asked of me.</p> <p>"Not yet. But now they're all getting to know you."</p> <p>He smiled. "Thank you."</p> <p>We walked up to the house and I put my plan into action. He helped me into my new house clothes. I told him to find a good place to live which I knew he had.</p> <p>There was nowhere for us in the house except the roof, which is a pretty nice thing too. I laid down my groundsheet on the floor of the outside house. My house wasn't anything fancy like the rest of the ships house, because I just wasn't comfortable with our situation. I told him to sit down on my floor, to which he did while I put my house and everything I owned on.</p> <p>There were stairs, of course, and I put a lot of things in a large metal box in the house. I went to a room near the roof, with a large wooden table in the middle and some chairs on either end. At one end of the table was a large wooden wooden box. The box contained what I was waiting for with my eyes. I put a small gold ring on his finger and told him to open it. He did so, and I put a metal ring around his finger. I asked him to put the ring on his finger slowly. After what I had planned, there wasn't much to do.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and leaned down to kiss me, holding me tight with his hands. He put most of the weight of his body on top of mine and he rubbed his hardness, up and down my spine.</p> <p>He finally broke the kiss, breathing slowly and deeply. He asked, "How will I take the ring?"</p> <p>"The ring is a big diamond, honey. The ring is perfect for this situation." His hands came from around me and he squeezed my breasts. It was an amazing feeling of being in his strong hands. He wanted to touch them.</p> <p>"Is there some kind of punishment at stake?" I asked. I knew it was a little risky, but this was the way we were going to go. I had no idea where to start.</p> <p>"Don't worry, love. I won't hurt you." He continued undressing me slowly, taking off all my clothes and then leaving me naked on the floor.</p> <p>I went over to the table where my ring was and picked it out. I put the ring inside and it felt really good inside me. And it felt so good.</p> <p>"Here you can open it while I sit down," I said.</p> <p>I took off my socks but left my shoes on. I put the ring inside on the table and opened up the box. I lifted the lid up and there was an image in front of me. I couldn't believe it.</p> <p>It was a beautiful gold ring with small diamonds on it. Like myself it was so shiny and smooth. The ring looked sexy to me. I picked it up and put it on my finger. The ring made me feel like a sex goddess. It was so sexy to realize that I was in love with this man.</p> <p>man and I realized that we had just had a very bad intentions for each other world in our relationship. He loved me in each, but I wanted to be in love with him more. I was willing. woman and I loved herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
