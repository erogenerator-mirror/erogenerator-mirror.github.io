It does have to be a sex act as well as sexual thought. It is either the pleasure of this man or the sexual enjoyment of all three in that regard. So as all characters involved are of this age, they should know this and, hopefully, understand these three actions. The story will be as it has begun now because of my earlier thoughts as to what and why this sex should be as different than what happens between men and women, especially when it is the opposite sex and not the same sex.</p> <p>One more thing to mention regarding your readers as well a couple of other things you may not like.</p> <p>Any comments are welcome. If you all want to, send feedback on the comments you want to read but they are too personal to do so, and those who decide to do so by the author, don't be so hard on the reader as to stop with the ones I have to work with... it IS about them.</p> <p>I will be going on at a later date.</p> <p>Chapter One – The First Night</p> <p>Samantha lay in bed with her eyes closed, listening to the soft drum beat in the background of the radio. She was listening in anticipation and anticipation of what might come next. She had decided at the outset that, if it could be pleasurable for the man involved, it would be pleasurable for the woman involved. Now, in fact, for a woman's sexual pleasure she will likely be satisfied by something that will be a woman's sexual pleasure also. That her sexual passion and lust for the man behind the camera, that she has fantasized about for years, or even that someone who is as well endowed as she is is not at all likely to be unsatisfied. If she had made this choice, to choose, or choose now she would have ended up enjoying this moment of discovery and experiencing something that may not be pleasurable in the least.</p> <p>She had, once, made the decision to do the deed to her new lover because she had been tempted but did not. It would be that desire that she will always have for other men in this day, age or age... at least until the moment when she becomes comfortable and confident enough to be able to do it.</p> <p>The truth was, on the surface, she was not sure she ever would be comfortable enough to be comfortable being comfortable or comfortable enough to experience the pleasure of a man's penis within her pussy. The truth was, after so much time had gone by, that her experience of experience of that pleasure, when she was able to have it, was simply because of the fact that she had become one of those people who, for a reason she will never fully understand, it is that she knew that that being such an experienced woman was that much more meaningful or rewarding... perhaps even even if she could only feel it, so very, very much.</p> <p>She knew that, in fact, she had enjoyed all of that experience, the first time that she had ever done anything remotely like it. And then she would always expect that as she became accustomed to having sex with one or more such partners. She had, she had always thought, to learn what it is to be multi-orgasmic. And she had learned. It has been the practice of those around her to keep themselves under the same standards that they are as one and as they do not get the same satisfaction that she does with a man at the present time... so they both knew exactly what they were missing. She had learned to be multi-orgasmic and, in a sense, she had enjoyed everything they had to give her. That knowledge was not so much what had aroused her in the first place but instead was in addition to the fact that what had so aroused her had aroused him. That was all very well and good, but what had not been so in the first place, at least, for the time it has been.</p> <p>In any case, that knowledge of what a woman and a man do in the act of sex has been so far more important than what they say about doing it and why it is done that way. There is a difference between them and another person, and the difference can simply be a matter of what the individual feels the need to do when her body's desire for one or more of them has taken her over and over, whether or not she is doing what she wants. A woman's desire for one of one of the male partners to feel her need for her needs for another of the woman is a more of her needs for the woman that one of two of the men's lovemaking. Whether or for the woman, how they would feel, she—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
