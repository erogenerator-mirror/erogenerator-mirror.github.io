The schooner trembled to her</strong> toes as the heavy and rigid column, as if carved from marble, slid through the air. A light, wet touch of her wet finger tip on her palm as she drew the tip over a hard, sensitive nub that made him shiver. She pressed her palm gently to his chest, and he winced again as she slowly withdrew her hand then pressed her other palm into his torso, spreading his legs so she could enter herself with two of her long fingers. They danced inside herself, she knew he needed more than that, and pulled off his vest and shirt to kiss his face. She was surprised by his eagerness and began to move down his neck and chest, biting and licking the spot just below his throat, before she let her teeth sink into his shoulder and he gasped as she sucked the blood from it. Her tongue flicked against him again as he rolled his knees, then rolled her to her back, kissing her throat up and down, down and over each square inch of skin that met her throat before sliding along the small slope into her chest.</p> <p>He rolled onto his stomach as she straddled his thighs and pressed her pussy down hard on his hard cock. She pressed herself into his skin with each downward stroke of hip as her breasts bounced free, brushing her ribcage, her nipples hard and puckered. Her hands moved to his shaft, and her fingers began to slide along it while the other hand toyed up and down his ass, then up around into his hair, her fingers rubbing over his balls, down over the crack then back up before moving to his ass cheeks, squeezing, kneading, rubbing. Another finger joined them in his ass and she gasped when she could feel the heat from his balls that rose in his groin. The tip of her middle finger pushed into his anus as it was clenched by his sphincter. His own cock twitched uncontrollably within his trousers as she started to twist her hips to work himself deeper within him, her hips lifting in response to his. His own cock was at full power, bobbing with her motion, pushing against the fabric beneath, wanting to enter her, to feel the soft skin of her sex surrounding it, wanting to be inside her.</p> <p>She stopped the motion of her hips mid-ride and started a steady pace of pushing down, and in and out as she pressed her hands into his hips, to the small of his back, and his ass, to the small of his waist. She brought his head into view and his eyes rolled back as she leaned forward and kissed him. "Do you like that," she asked.</p> <p>"Y-yes," he replied breathily. "Yes, I like it."</p> <p>She bent forward and licked the nape on top of his neck before taking one of his hands in hers, bringing it down to his cock. With little more than a touch and a flick of her tongue, she began to rotate it inside his ass while she held it firmly between two of her fingers. He moaned as she took his cock inside her mouth, wrapping her lips more tightly around him, with her other hand cupping his balls, then pressing down. She looked up into his eyes and he held her gaze as he felt himself push up inside her, felt the heat rise from his cock, felt pressure build until it felt like he would pop out of her mouth altogether before she closed her lips around the shaft, as if she were swallowing. With an expression of wonderment and anticipation, he felt himself sink deep inside her throat and began to fuck it furiously. At this last act, she began to slowly squeeze her thighs together so he could push inside her and grind against her.</p> <p>She felt his cock slip down her throat as her lips were sealed by his pubic hair, and began to pull herself up off his cock. He felt her hand, then fingers pulling the front of his trousers out of their belt loops as he began to grind himself against the fabric with both of them. She was on her knees now, holding on to him, pulling her skirt up, as she moved from one of his legs to the other. With both hands now free, she tugged out his shaft, leaving a trail of wetness as she moved his balls under the cotton. She lifted and turned to lean back against the headboard of his bed, and pulled her own dress off over her head. As she pulled off her shorts and panties, her bare hair was swaying about her body as she did, in an unmistakable, yet sultry way. She looked at herself in his bed, her legs parted on both sides of his torso, her back arched as she knelt at his level, her hands on her hips for leverage. He could feel the weight of her upper and shape of her body, as she leaned on hand, and the motion of her breasts, as well as her fingers kneaded in his balls.
