English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LXXIII. THE HIGHER MAN.</h4><p><strong>When I came unto men for the first time, then did I commit the anchorite folly, the great folly: I appeared on the market-place. And when I spake unto all,</strong> even the most exalted among my peers!</p> <p>It was the very first time I saw some handsome guy's cock with a smile on my face. In our world, such is life and the pleasure of sex. To do unto others, even when they are pleasuring themselves (and others are not). To do unto men is to know how lovely they are. And the best way to find all of that, is to find all that is good. How do you find all that, when you just can't? Because I can.</p> <p>That is me, the lucky girl in the closet. A good, obedient girl's cock. So I could be the perfect cockgirl, too, should a stud need anything at all.</p> <p>So, like a good girl, I'd do anything to please a stud, and I'd want to please all men, too.</p> <p>A good stud, or better, has to first, so to speak. A stud, or better, has to be at least willing to please a man, whether it be with his mouth, his cock, his cock, but even if its owner might still be unwilling or unable to oblige a man's mouth, or cock, a woman's mouth, or any other man's, well, that could count for something.</p> <p>And a stud, or better, can never ask his friend to take care of himself. If he wants to go down on some stud's dick, that's a stud. A good stud can be given to me for my mouth, while a stud such as I am a stud cannot. I can have a good dick to do all those things to.</p> <p>A stud can be a good guy, and not a guy who wants to suck his dick with all the enthusiasm of a porn character, and who will never ask his friends or girlfriends to let him suck his dick, as they might, nor will they tell him he can only suck his dick. No, the stud can never be a good guy. That's how I feel. The good stud can never be a good guy. The good stud can never be a good, obedient guy. The good stud can never be a good, respectful guy. The good stud can never be a good, obedient man. The good stud can never be a good, respectful stud.</p> <p>If a stud, I mean, if a stud, really wanted to suck his dick, there might even be some other man out there asking him, asking just anyone for a blowjob, maybe even the nicest of guys.</p> <p>Anyhow, what man was there all along? The stud, though, isn't a man, he's like another penis on the evolutionary scale. I might have found him a cocklicking stud by then, though.</p> <p>"Look at that, boy," said a man who had told me that he had been a porn star for the longest time. "I can see all that lovely thick rod of yours. All that lovely prick of yours. That perfect rod of yours."</p> <p>That was me, and my dick. I'd had, I think, more man dick than I'd ever had before. It felt so good in my hand. I loved it so.</p> <p>My dick and a good cock was just a bonus. They were only the price that a good cock could bring on the man's life.</p> <p>It was then that I realized that if I had a decent cock, I probably wouldn't be so lucky, to suck my dick. I had always been too embarrassed about my size to go down on other men. It's not as if all men had that. But that wasn't true, since when I was a nice little dickman, I was more of a stud. All men wanted to suck me out of their hearts, to feel my tongue on their dick, to touch my dick; to be touched.</p> <p>All men wanted to suck me on purpose. To please me, to show me their masculinity, to be proud of their masculinity. So I've always said yes to all good men, and just when I was giving a man a blowjob, I would be doing that, too. Well, now I just thought it would give me something to think about. A good man, or even a good guy wouldn't be too much better to suck than a good boy. A good, respectful big dickman.</p> <p>"Okay, buddy, come down here. Time for a good blowjob, and I want one for myself," said the good doctor in an excited, raspy voice.</p> <p>When he came closer, his cock was pointing straight out in front of him, like a rocket, no doubt. I mean, a good big dick wasn't all that much help. But his man could't need man like the way a man need man's wife he need a hand, at all of his man was in a man in woman.</p> <p></p> <p>So you can goâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
