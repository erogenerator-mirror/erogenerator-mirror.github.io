The ship of the First Crusade was lost as the water ran out, leaving a wet trail on the sandy floor. It was an uncomfortable time for men who needed comfort, a time for sex, and a time for work. For this reason, most all men were forced to go to the docks to escape the cold.</p> <p>There was no other explanation.</p> <p>The ship had just taken sail when she spotted the ship's captain, the one with the sea dog eyes, walk into her bedroom. The captain had a big beard. He seemed older, his white uniform shirt and black button up dark slacks. The captain wore a white long sleeve button front shirt with one of the buttons wide open in front. As he walked toward her, she could feel her body reacting as he was. He got closer, but stopped and looked her in the eyes.</p> <p>She wondered if he could really see her breasts, and she knew she should just stand there and let him stare. His lips moved, to kiss her, but she forced his mouth firmly against hers, but he didn't kiss her right away. Instead, he looked at the captain, and then smiled, leaned against the wall of her bedroom, and spoke.</p> <p>"Captain Sutter told me you're a very pretty young lady," he said, and started walking across the room.</p> <p>The captain grabbed her and pulled her close. He was going to kiss her, and she didn't dare.</p> <p>His lips touched hers, and she tried to pull away. Instead, she felt his tongue slide between her lips and slide right inside. This sent electric shock waves down her spine and through her pussy, causing it to convulse. She was wet from excitement.</p> <p>She pulled him closer, but only managed to keep a finger on his tongue a second, letting it push it into her willing mouth. She let the captain kiss her, his tongue darting in and out of her mouth, while she pushed him away, and stood up.</p> <p>Now she was the captain. He looked like a child who had just been picked up. He had on a white shirt, buttoned up all it was white, and looked both older, younger, and in control.</p> <p>He took her into his arms and lifted her so her small, tight body was resting in his chest. She could feel the roughness of his beard against her back, and her breasts were pressing into him, and he leaned over to caress them with his thumbs. He sucked on her neck and earlobes as she let him explore her body. She tried to push him away, but he was too strong, and held her tight and kissed her passionately. His tongue made circles on her tongue as it darted in and out of her mouth, and he moved both his hands around the small of her back to squeeze her ass as he kissed her.</p> <p>Sutter's kisses were on her neck and upper chest and down her breasts and stomach slowly, and his left arm reached up to fondle her breast as he kissed her.</p> <p>His right hand moved down to her ass, and she could feel his hand moving over her bottom. He put his hands in between the cheeks of her ass, and moved them over the entire, large part of her ass, pressing them together and making her pussy drip.</p> <p>She felt a hardening of her own crotch as his hands moved higher. She tried to close her legs, but couldn't. He stopped her, and pressed her thighs together as a sign of reassurance.</p> <p>"Are you ready to surrender already?" he asked. "Do it for me."</p> <p>She looked into his eyes, and nodded.</p> <p>His right hand slid up the outside of her thigh slowly, until he reached her wetness. He pushed her legs apart as he moved his hand up to her sex, which was slick with her own juices. He slowly slid the tip of his finger inside her, feeling her wetness. She sighed and pushed back at him, but his hand was still there. Suddenly, he slid both his fingers deep inside her. His middle finger moved inside her wet, hot pussy like a snake, as he moved his fingers around inside. With his middle finger inside her, and his middle finger inside her, he slowly moved both his fingers around in her, and she loved the feeling. She had no idea how fast her body let her come.</p> <p>As her orgasm neared, he put his hand on top of hers, held it steady as her orgasm passed. He pulled his fingers out and his thumb to her clit.</p> <p>a loud moan, "Ohhhhhhhhmmm.... ohhhhhhhhhhhmmmm...," escaped her. her mouth then came out into his and was silent. as her lungs. not. "Oh. .</p> <p>yes, not me Ohhhhhhhhh...
