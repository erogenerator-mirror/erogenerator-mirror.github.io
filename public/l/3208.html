English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>IX. THE PREACHERS OF DEATH.</h4><p><strong>There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom desistance from life must be preached. Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life</strong>: not from God's rules, and those who would hate life is for that which is born. In time the age of preachers of death are over. In time of preachers the age of preachers are over. In time of preachers are the age of immortality: a age of eternal life.</p> <p>The day Jesus saw the light of the day, he was born again. He was born again, and now he was a man again, and a man who could not be tempted to sin by a mortal sin. What a wonderful life we have. So bright. We've been able to see many beautiful things in the sun. We've learned many things in the heat of passion. We've learned to live in sin. Life and all is beautiful. Peace.</p> <p>Life is a sacred gift. We've seen the light of the sunshine in the sun, and we've seen everything we've imagined being: art, nature, religion. Life is a sacred gift. Life is a holy gift. Life is sacred. We can feel as if we have the love of an immortal being.</p> <p>God is in heaven on his throne, which he loves with every fiber of his being; we can feel as though we have the love of an immortal being.</p> <p>Epic is the best time, the sun is in the clouds, and the rain, the breeze is gentle in your hair. There is no world you're not in, and no world you don't think of; there is a world you don't know, a world you can't tell one another of.</p> <p>Epic is the sun is in the clouds, and the rain is gentle in your hair. You are in a world called Heaven. It is a world with infinite possibilities.</p> <p>I thought about my life all of a million times, and in the end I knew what it would be once again, and what it was that I had to do to get around to it, with me, alone, living in sinless space; living under shadow, and having God above.</p> <p>But I knew that I would have to choose my life, and not just my future. My life, my future, and my future would be the same, but I just couldn't decide to be that life, because I really didn't know what God was going to do for me. That was before AIDS could've been passed.</p> <p>I decided I wanted a life of adventure, with a beautiful girl from California who could be my wife. After all, if she knew the same, she would probably let me have her for that much shorter of a period, by the time we were through, before I could finally be happy again. But she'd be my wife, my wife, until she passed away, and while not the brightest bulb in the right place, the light of day was bright enough to let me see her pretty eyes and her big breasts bouncing in time with the thunder in the night.</p> <p>I decided to take a chance, an easy decision, and then I could go and marry her. When I'd made that decision, I wondered if I could really live a life of happiness without sinning, without sinning, having a romantic relationship with a woman whom I knew would never take me back to this day, and if I could ever live without sinning, with loving love, without sinning, with loving women.</p> <p>I wondered if I could live without sinting. I wondered if I could live without having a relationship with a woman, a woman who I'd met before and not just fucked before she hooked up with me, who I'd wanted to have been my wife before I'd given into temptation.</p> <p>I made the decision to marry her, at last. I made the decision to have a happy life.</p> <p>I made the decision to live.</p> <p>I took the time to think about what to do next. I needed to make the right choice, and I needed to decide to come back to California, when I was ready to find a life of my own, a life I'd never have.</p> <p>After all of that, even though there was still something to be said about having a relationship with a woman who would fuck you, fuck your brains out, just to make you feel special, just for a short time, I decided to make my choice and make it right one day, before I was ready to give in to God, and commit to God's everlasting plan for me, to commit to having a romantic relationship with a woman from California who would never cheat on me.</p> <p>I couldn't say it for me, because right now I didn't have the courage to ask. I was too afraid that I'd been too easy to do that, too easy to do what I had to do. I was.</p> <p></p> <p>"What's been going to ask what I got me wrong that wrong" why that." That? There have to be for I'd be I got a wrongâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
