From Apollonius, true liberty, and unvariable steadfastness, and not</h4><p><strong>to regard anything at all, though never so little, but right and reason: and always, whether in the sharpest pains, or after the loss of a child, or in long</strong>-term relationships that ended badly, or within or after a broken marriage, or in a situation when there was little in it, and only a couple of times you'd have made it up with a few "friends"; a few times it was you, and that wasn't a bad thing; or a particularly bad thing.</p> <p>You saw, I was one of those people, right?</p> <p>When I was seventeen and living in Los Angeles, I'd had a couple of boys, and although it didn't make me queer as much as most young guys, it was a good time to get involved in group sex. I was hooked and so was my first husband.</p> <p>That summer of my twentieth year.</p> <p>That year, my first real party: we came home and found Tom and Diane, my parents' friends, in the back of our parents' garage, waiting for me to come and pick them up.</p> <p>There was a big table on the other side of the patio, with two guys in their late twenties, all four of them, and they went over the course of the evening, drinking beer and chatting, and laughing, and doing a lot of the talking. They were all about Tom at that time, and I think they really liked Tom.</p> <p>Tom and Diane, at that time, were on a vacation with friends from their high school days, and they all had some great sex together.</p> <p>So I walked into the backyard party, and to be honest, even though I couldn't see them through the patio doors, I was feeling pretty slutty. My skirt was so short, and, even though I had no panties on, I felt my panties getting damp. But this party was strictly for people I didn't know at all, and was mostly being introduced to my parents, their friends (I didn't go to any of them yet), and their wives. Besides, they all seemed to know what Tom was like, and I didn't really mind their attention.</p> <p>So I took my skirt and tights off and slipped them on. I had them on for the trip without a bra that summer, so I left them on, since I wasn't sure what they'd look like lying on the pool table, or getting fucked on the grass in front of me by some stranger. If I thought it would embarrass the other girls, I could just go to another party, when I hadn't had much time to do so. I didn't think about having to explain to my folks the fact that my skirt was shorter than they normally wore. I didn't think about the whole "slutty" thing or the big party at our house I was planning. I just thought about getting fucked on the pool table while naked in front of the other men. I had to admit, I had never been fucked on the pool table before.</p> <p>I was ready for this party, and I didn't even know anyone else. That's the problem with so many people at such parties; it's like you learn how to really get into the mood without losing your balance. I'm such a slut now, I'm in slut mode. I didn't realize just how much of the party I'd be getting involved in until I'd already gone home, got in the car, and gotten myself off. My skirt was getting really short, and I was feeling like somebody might notice and demand I just take it off, but I couldn't tell anyone else.</p> <p>So I went there without panties on and I laid out there in the sun, and Tom and Diane were sitting on the grass, and they didn't have panties on, so I wasn't wearing a skirt any more anymore, so I was still getting turned on and horny as I was at that time. They were getting frisky as I spread my legs and my fingers slid inside my pussy, and then they were on me. They got me off, and I came back down the street to go home.</p> <p>Then they were all around me, and I went and got undressed, and then left the party. I never did take anything off all summer. Just a thin towel, so I could really be naked, then I had to dry myself off. That's when I had to take my clothes off and then walk back home to clean off my own pussy. There were a lot of men, and some women, who knew exactly what I was like, and didn't let it embarrass me, and I had my own orgasm too. I was just feeling pretty crazy right then, and not feeling too guilty about it - yet.</p> <p>And then my parents came over and they were all laughing and drinking beer and talking about me, and their friends had already gone upstairs for a long moment. I guess, because I went right after the first, but then they were just getting frisky, and only one of their friends together, and were fucking me all at that night, and the other men were fucking me, andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
