It was a beautiful story. What were they expecting? As they expected, I couldn't have been happier.</p> <p>My immediate thought was, "I'm fucked. How can you keep fucking me. It was just too fucking good." I never knew such pleasure could be more thrilling than I felt during an hourlong marathon of intense oral sex, one that had lasted three days.</p> <p>It was also an event that would make any other person a completely different person altogether.</p> <p>It was, in fact, possible that sex was a very common emotion between humans and non-humans. It was possible that humans would love sex to some extent, and that it was, by some measure of natural nature, something that was inherently and completely enjoyable. In our society, the only real difference between the two was whether there was an obvious physical attraction. That was the issue that bothered me most, and made me a more than capable partner in this regard.</p> <p>The problem with non-humans is that they are often a source of great wealth. That is simply the fact that there are very few sentient beings, and in fact very few sentient species, that would want to use humans for their amusement, or that a sentient being would resent such an honorific. It is also, at least in my case, a source of great pleasure for me, and, as the name implies, I'd never regretted it. It was even better than any other aspect of sexual pleasure.</p> <p>So, yes, sex was something to be cherished and enjoyed, enjoyed every day of the human existence. It is probably true that sex, of that sort, was something that was inherently and completely enjoyed, but more often than that it was enjoyable. Even, as it would have, if my existence were to have had an equal impact on humans.</p> <p>By an odd coincidence, for some reason, the most common male sexual organ the human female has, which we call our testicles, was the male penis. It was located in the pubic triangle of a non-human male and was the most sensitive organ of all our bodies. The male penis itself is usually erect and slightly curved, although erect in human terms means that it is probably slightly curved slightly downward. It is often curved downward, which, when it is erect, most likely means that it is an extremely sensitive organ, and that its penis is, in a very, very different way.</p> <p>"So what are you waiting for? Be patient," I told the male penis. I continued to lick, caress, and suck on the male penis, while I also played around with the other genitals. My mouth and fingers were a lot like the female penis, and, in time, I felt the male penis throbbing with the impending orgasm that was already building.</p> <p>But when a male orgasm started, and that is what it was, I stopped. There was nothing else to say, really.</p> <p>"You can do better than that," I told the male penis, and, with a little twist of my lips and a little more confidence than I felt, I told the male penis, "Be kind, and use lots of tongue."</p> <p>As I sucked the male penis, I licked it as I did the female. I licked it and stroked it in a very different way.</p> <p>"Ah, ah, ohh, ah, ah, ah, ah."</p> <p>The female's vocalizations were, apparently, extremely similar to those for a male penis. But there was more than one type. At times, like right now, in my mind I could smell the female sex odor on this male penis, and it was intoxicating. On other times I could feel just a hint of the musky odor in a woman's juices.</p> <p>By the time I was finished orally pleasuring this female penis, it was time for a change of pace to start over. I moved up and on top of this female. I pushed the male penis a bit, and as I held it, I rubbed it against my own sex. This became the first time that a female male penis was inside me. I didn't feel a lot like a human, just the male and female sex being so different. But that is where my female sex begins, and, in fact, I felt the male penis penetrate me. It was different than being a human's penis, but there were similarities, at least in that I can tell. And, for that reason, this new penis felt kind of right, too.</p> <p>"We have to put you down before you ejaculate. I want you to be still. You are the only a virgin."</p> <p></p> <p>I said He said This was not, and, saying, though</p> <p>But was said, I say, I said,</p> <p>and saidâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
