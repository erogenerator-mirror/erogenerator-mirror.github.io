Promptly at ten o’clock that night De</strong> Medici goes through a diaphanous chamber of sorts and makes love with that same candlestick. Julien kisses a candlestick, a candlestick, and a candlestick is his penis. But that candlestick is not so bad as the dickstick. Julien makes love with a candlestick. But its not as good as a true penis. And besides—the truth is that its better when having sex, but not having a vagina is better than masturbating. But that's too personal, folks, and too dangerous.</p> <p>The candlestick has been a favorite practice of Julien since the start of the twenty-first century. For an hour or so it becomes a regular practice whenever he fucks.</p> <p>It only works for two people at a time and there isn't a doubt in my mind that the man fucking me is going to have his dick out and come in me. That's not so much likely though. It's not just the idea of fucking in some way that a dick stick ought to feel good sliding in and out of my cunt. My cunt is more intimate. It's more sensuous. For a long time it's been sensuously, slowly, wonderfully tight. I enjoy it.</p> <p>But I also enjoy it. I enjoy the taboo that a dick stick can't touch, or that it can't satisfy. And I enjoy the danger of fucking in some way that a dick stick cannot. And I enjoy the danger too.</p> <p>But the candlestick, however I'm on to, I'm still curious about. This guy must be really horny, or maybe even too aroused. I can probably sense that he is. And while it makes me so aroused that my clit tingles and makes my stomach quiver, so does Julien. His cock twitches in anticipation. My eyes widen.</p> <p>But the idea that I still want to fuck, to fuck him, is so exciting that I really wouldn't think about just fucking him. I'd probably feel ashamed of having sex with an object of sexuality who's just as horny as I am. And I really would know it was a waste.</p> <p>If that's what I decide to do, and I do just that, I'll take him there, and then we'll have what I suspect isn't quite as much fun as the first time with him. But first things first.</p> <p>We sit down on the couch while we watch the movie. I take the candlestick from Julien, and stand up, unbuttoning my sweater. I take off my shirt, which doesn't take the candlestick for long. I pull my sweater off and throw it aside. I'm clad in a pale blue bra, my breasts spilling out over the cups. My breasts are bigger then average, but in proportion to my body they're pretty big. Julien can't take his eyes off them. And I can feel his interest growing.</p> <p>So I bend down, unfastening the clasp of my skirt and wiggling my hips. Julien's eyes go wide and he grins wildly, but it looks natural. I lift my skirt over my hips and throw it toward him. I hold the candlestick away from him with one hand while keeping my skirt in front of me, so as to give Julien some time to admire my sexy little panties before we start fucking. Julien's eyes widen, but he doesn't need to be asked to watch us.</p> <p>I slide my panties down and step out of them. I spread one foot out and one foot into the middle of the living room so that Julien can see my pinkish-brown bush. He doesn't seem to know at all how to pick it to have his eyes on it, either. I walk out of them, leaving the sexy blue bra and panties on. I bend over and pick up the candlestick. I stand up again and move toward Julien.</p> <p>At such a moment I feel more in control of myself, because I know that he wants to be able to witness my pussy.</p> <p>I put the candlestick against Julien's penis and start to stroke its length. We both watch my hands rub my wet cunt while I stroke the tip. Once I start to feel a little dizzy, I lean in and kiss him. With the candlestick against my cunt it feels like the first time we make out. The way I'm kissing is so sensuous that it feels like kissing a woman. It's too bad Julien isn't a real man, because I'd love to take him in my mouth.</p> <p>I bend away from him, and lower my head to him. I'm going to suck his dick now! It's not much longer then your dick, but it's been awhile. Then I can get half an idea about half come. I just come a idea that I think. It could be my pussy to be yours, let me have you Julien come I come I say—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
