Hark!</h4><p><strong>“HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?” It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the</strong> courtyard, their bodies lithe and bronzed as if they were the waves. This night was magical; all the way around; all the ways in which life and death can dance together.</p> <p>“Oh, my, a good idea! So, is this night for fucking?”</p> <p>The man's voice said, “If you're feeling so good, we'll be at it some time. Come, give me a kiss.” The crowd gasped, and when the man was standing before them, they kissed each other on the mouth, and the crowd went nuts. When the kiss ended, they applauded and cheered as if it were the applause of the gods.</p> <p>The crowd cheered for the man also; the moonlight showed the moonlight to be shiny and shimmering, sparkling and glittering. The moonlight was reflecting, but it could not interfere with life. They were not standing on the beach, naked people; they had to be at a beach just as naked as they were standing there.</p> <p>“You're a good actress, aren't you? Come, come. I'll show you some stars you haven't seen before. Oh, God, I can't believe this night's happening to me, this is so wild. You've got to watch and learn, or you'll leave so soon. You must learn to take it all!”</p> <p>The audience cheered and applauded wildly, as their hearts fluttered wildly.</p> <p>“We can do it, now! Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me,” the man croaked in a language unknown—or at least not far from it. “Shoot your load, doggy style, doggy style, doggy style.” He cried, “Come on, it's right here, fuck me, don’t stop. Come on, I’m going to cum now!”</p> <p>“Oh, yes, doggy style. Are you ready to cum?” the man cried out in what turned to a shrieking cry.</p> <p>“Not yet, dear. Fuck me, fuck me, doggy style,” the man cried out again. “My balls are getting heavy, they’re going to blow, they’ll cum, it’s happening, it’s too soon, doggy style, cum in my ass, come on, doggy style, doggy style, cum in my ass, come on, cum in my ass. I can’t, I can’t hold back; I’m cumming, I’m cumming.</p> <p>“Don’t hold back. Cum in my ass, doggy style, doggy style, don’t stop, doggy style, cum in my ass, doggy style, cum in my ass.” They chanted out in unison. It was their last song, the last night, until the very next full moon.</p> <p>A new wave of ecstasy swept through their bodies when the man called out. His entire body was electrified and trembling, his heart beating fiercely. His mind was exploding with pleasure, with emotions that his body had never known for he had experienced such a powerful explosion.</p> <p>When his balls, now heavy and swollen, finally emptied their load in his pubic hair, into the man’s ass, deep into the man’s body, he could have made a statue of himself. He’d done it. Felt the man’s orgasm. It was so strong and intense that it had no place left for the imagination. And, he had to. He had to release his sperm into the man’s ass. He had to.</p> <p>When he began moving his finger in and out of the man’s ass and his other hand on his penis, he could have pulled it out and ejaculated into that orifice. He had to. As he thrust his finger into the ass, deeper and deeper inside that man’s passage, it made his sperm shoot through his penis like a missile from a rocket launcher. Each time he thrust his finger, he pumped his own hot semen into the man’s passage. He had to release his sperm in that orifice. He had to. And with his other hand, he brought his penis to his mouth. In his mouth he swallowed his sperm; he had to have his semen. He had to do it now and always. After swallowing, the man pulled his fingers from his ass, let his penis slide to his belly and the sea waterline of the man had, and his hip, and that had been underwater: there during the man, and the orgasm had been there, to his abdomen, in the man, his chest; and, he had been and the sea; there in the sea of his body, that was his body had—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
