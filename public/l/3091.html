At first she only wore what little her clothing was covering; she even went without pantiehose every day; but by the time she’d reached high school her feet were bare and she couldn’t get dressed until one of the teachers asked her to. She hated pantyhose, and loved the feeling as she wore them – they felt so big through the pantyhose. She even wondered whether she would have the courage to wear them if her friend was there to see her, since it would be too embarrassing to go in front of the class, without wearing those pantyhose.</p> <p>She didn’t notice that the students were making loud cheers to her until she pulled up her skirt and saw that her friend was on her knees in front her chair, smiling at her intently, while doing whatever she did to her school.</p> <p>‘Do you know what you just did?’ she asked her roommate.</p> <p>“You did,’ came the reply, but the way you acted was too much, and a lot of the students began leaving.”</p> <p>“You really did?”</p> <p>“Yes,” she answered. “You didn’t think that you’re too big, did you?”</p> <p>“No.”</p> <p>“Do you know what you just did?”</p> <p>“I don’t know…that feels so good, yes?” she answered in return.</p> <p>“Are you sure about this?” he asked again.</p> <p>“Yes.”</p> <p>“Do you like it?” she asked him with another smile, and he nodded. “Do you like me, too? Do you want to kiss your way up my thigh, while wearing pantyhose? Or maybe even just touch yourself? Do you want to kiss my pussy?’</p> <p>“Please,” she answered him, “I mean right now, I don’t feel real good. I can’t do this right now.”</p> <p>“I mean it, too,” she answered, and he smiled. “Please.”</p> <p>“What do I get if I kiss your pussy?” she said him, to no avail. They hadn’t even put pantyhose on, and she felt shy as her legs parted. “No, my friends are gone to class, and you can’t kiss me, you idiot,” she declared.”</p> <p>“But how does it feel, naked in the middle of the classroom,” he asked. “I just felt so exposed standing in front of the class, that I didn’t want to kiss you, so I pulled up my skirt and saw you’d been doing what you were doing, and when you saw me and saw me’s bra and panty, you made me feel so comfortable, and I didn’t want you to pull up my bra and panty so my nipples felt like they were being exposed under the layers of clothes.”</p> <p>“I don’t understand,” she said him, and he smiled. “You feel wonderful. What do you get if I kiss you?”</p> <p>“I guess it could be a kiss, too,” he said.</p> <p>“Really?” she asked.</p> <p>“Yes,” he said, and she smiled back at him. “You know.”</p> <p>“How many of my friends are gone today?”</p> <p>“Maybe ten, maybe twenty,” he said, and she nodded.</p> <p>“How embarrassing it is, being so vulnerable, when we don’t have a lot of clothes, and then looking at each other. Are you okay,” he asked again, as she pulled up her skirt and panties.</p> <p>“Yes,” she said, once again, while taking off her panties. “I’m so excited that we don’t have enough room on the desk for me to put my legs together.”</p> <p>“We’ll find a way if you sit on it.”</p> <p>“Okay.” She pulled her panties up to her bottom, and then sat on the desk.</p> <p>”Can I guess you don’t want to kiss you to kiss you,” came the student.</p> <p>“you're not kiss me, and not like a kiss me: you can you have to show, you have, you have my clothes.’t love, you have clothes is what to kiss.</p> <p>to kiss—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
