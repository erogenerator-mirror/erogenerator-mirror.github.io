In her bedroom and in her arms her partner was not merely one of the people she'd just fucked, but someone other wise she'd already conquered, so she'd taken a lover, another girl, and she fucked them both, and both for the love of God she had an orgasm, she had the next person to ever see in her life, and she fucked her two lovers, she had cum, she had had an orgasm and not just one but three with all four orgasms of her body. She fucked her two lovers while her lovers fucked her in the morning, while her lovers fucked her at night, while her lovers fucked her next weekend, while she slept for half the day, she slept for three hours and didn't even dream of doing something in the afternoon during the next weekend... and she came twice.</p> <p>And they made love to her again. And again. After all that had occurred so far, in the end she fell asleep, she did some heavy lifting with her legs and arms, she felt that orgasm coming. But she could not remember much or much of the night. Her mind was still filled with thoughts of being fucked by all the different cocks in her life. The orgasms she had when lovers had fucked her so much she felt like something new. One person fucked her so much she could never remember a single fuck in her life and she was still having orgasms. She never made anyone cum. She never went with a lover after coming two orgasms. She was happy and fulfilled in the relationship she'd just had. A wonderful partner, and yet so different, one who was a mystery to her and who she knew she'd never meet, who she had to worry about but who she could never see again, who seemed too far from her and who could never love again, and she had just fucked three men in this relationship. But then, she was still going to have her boyfriend after they fucked. She wasn't ready for him yet. Yet she was definitely ready. And she was happy to spend as much time with him and to see him more. She'd love him. She loved him all over again, but also she loved him that much more because he'd given her the most. And she loved him all right because she wanted him - whether she knew it or not.</p> <p>"So that's where you are," she said again to the sleeping man who sat just beside her on the bed.</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "And you'll love me too."</p> <p>"That's pretty fucking awesome. And then why don't I know that you're coming back for a few more days so I could go pick you up and come back and fuck you again in the morning?"</p> <p>"That sounds like a great plan."</p> <p>"Yeah, actually, it's pretty awesome."</p> <p>"So now I'm going to tell you that if you decide to come back for more nights of fun you can give me a call and let me come and pick you up then."</p> <p>"Oh, fuck."</p> <p>"No need to be scared," he said, " I'm just not in the mood to go back and be one of the girls you fucked."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not. I'm not going to be at all. Now it's up to me."</p> <p>*</p> <p>I like to be prepared.</p> <p>I like to do my work quickly, while my mind is on the job.</p> <p>And I like to have fun sometimes too, while my body's on the edge of an orgasm.</p> <p>And I like to fuck.</p> <p>And I mean everything else: A man's cock or a woman's cock. I love all three.</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>The name of this posting is by itself without the title. It is for those of you who enjoy anonymous sex.</p> <p>Thank you for reading my stories.
