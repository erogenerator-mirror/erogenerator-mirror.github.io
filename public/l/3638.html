Before I did this, I had a week’s work</strong> ahead of me to get to the west coast. With that in mind, I wanted to set up for our journey.</p> <p>I had gone hiking with my mother about a month before heading on the east coast. The summer camp was really a hike, because as one of the members had remarked in the previous year, camp has always been a very popular place to start the year. The camp was well over seventy, so it was hard to say which way to go. The closest way to go was to the north. We were in the valley below Mount Hill.</p> <p>One of the few campfires was at a campsite about ten miles off the main road. It would normally be a perfect place but I was already too far from anybody else on the camp site to do anything. It would have been difficult to pack a tent and tent everything, even with a fire. We would have to go to a campground for a while and then head toward the park.</p> <p>There wasn’t much down there, so I thought we could stay and have some fun.</p> <p>I had brought a cooler full of picnic baskets that I’d brought along with me. I also brought a big beer bucket and bottle of water. There was only one fire and, unless I’d brought an extra person, that should serve us well.</p> <p>With a little help from Mom, I was able to bring everything including the clothes that was supposed to be on the clothesline. When all you had to leave off was the shirt of your outfit, we’d have a quick trip down the woods, around the reservoir and into the park. After that everything would be ready.</p> <p>Now I was alone with my mother. She still didn’t know how we’d do it, but that’ll be another story.</p> <p>Mom and I went to the tent site with no company there. There had to be somewhere to get off, and we planned on it anyway.</p> <p>We had a good chance to get to the nearest campground, by going around to the west side of the campground.</p> <p>Once we reached the campground and entered, I realized that the tent where I’d packed and the beer bucket were a little out of line. On the east side the fire place, I’d set up was fairly close to the campfire and, on the other hand, we could get a better angle.</p> <p>We had a nice table and a couple of cool beers. Of course, we were already under construction. I didn’t think that we could make it into the tent, even though I’d brought the stuff. But we managed.</p> <p>We laid down the blanket, I had a beer and Mom offered me a bottle of water.</p> <p>It really wasn’t much compared to the water we used with the campfire, but the water didn’t help with the tent. It was clear and cool when we put our feet in it, but I couldn’t help noticing how much cooler it was when we laid down. My mother and I began to touch and feel each other. First she was to my left. It was hard to put my arm across her shoulder and put her head on my right breast. Then she started to moan. She started to play with my nipples through my shirt and was also moaning louder this time.</p> <p>I started sucking on her neck while squeezing her right ear lobe gently with my left hand.</p> <p>After a while I felt like I was going to have an orgasm right there, but her head on my arm stopped me.</p> <p>She asked, “Are you okay, sweety?”</p> <p>I replied, “I’m fine, mom!”</p> <p>She went back to sucking my ear lobe and moved a hand into my shorts and wrapped a hand around my stiff cock that was already coming out. She had a firm grip and I enjoyed my moan, but I wasn’t thinking straight when my mother started to stroke me faster and harder.</p> <p>I said, “Please, I want to...”</p> <p>Then, I got out of control again. I said, “I want to cum inside you, mom.”</p> <p>She replied between moans, “I’m just enjoying feeling your soft skin on mine.”</p> <p>I continued stroking her through her pants.</p> <p>She kept on rubbing me, as I knew she’d do. my cock., but I couldn’d move lower, too. so I was going to the edge. I got off her. I got up on top of her right thigh. the bed. I managed to her panty thigh. I started mass moved my head. I started to the edge under them under her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
