Eddy, indeed, would talk for a few minutes from time to time in his</strong> mind.</p> <p>"Is there anything we wouldn't do," Eddy said to me the night we'd agreed to stay over at Eddy's house.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I replied.</p> <p>"What do you do when you're in your late teens?"</p> <p>"I make sure that I don't have any alcohol on my end for fear of getting arrested for Drunk Driving."</p> <p>"You're lucky," I joked in response.</p> <p>"Yeah," Eddy replied, "I am for that."</p> <p>By then we'd both finished our wine and left Eddy's house with our usual pleasantries. We got into his car and drove toward the nearest street. There were already half a dozen taxis sitting outside Eddy's house, so it was just a matter of one.</p> <p>We went into one that opened up to one of the back streetswalks that was lined with street signs. Eddy turned to face me and kissed me. We began kissing passionately again when an old familiar expression came over Eddy.</p> <p>"Come on, I've got something to show you," Eddy said, with a grin.</p> <p>"What's in it, baby?" I asked her innocently.</p> <p>"It's not a big deal," she replied.</p> <p>Then she pulled down her jeans and lifted them off to reveal her neatly trimmed bush. It felt quite familiar to Eddy, who'd just been exposed to another girl just moments ago.</p> <p>"Are you going to suck me?" Eddy asked me.</p> <p>"I don't know. I want to get a picture of it before getting back on the buses," I explained.</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Of course! You'd like that wouldn't you?" Eddy asked.</p> <p>"Yes!" I replied enthusiastically.</p> <p>"Then do it, honey," Eddy said to me. She got off her bed and sat on her bed cross-legged. She pulled up her jeans and then took my hand. She stood up, put on her clothes and led me down a small corridor that led to the door. It took us over a short distance to Eddy's home so we were in the centre of the corridor.</p> <p>"This is the way," she said, "this is the way for you to show me this way,"</p> <p>When we came to a door on the far side of the corridor I was amazed to see that we met in the middle of the corridor.</p> <p>"No underwear," Eddy said.</p> <p>There was a smile on her face, however. I noticed that the light was brighter so I could see her eyes, but what I saw on her face didn't help but confuse me.</p> <p>Eddy stood up and walked over to me. I followed Eddy's lead and stood there for a second, staring into Eddy's eyes.</p> <p>"You're just looking at me," she said seductively.</p> <p>"I am," I replied.</p> <p>Eddy reached for me and guided me into her home. I immediately dropped to my knees behind Eddy. At least I was looking at her face. And before I knew what I was doing I was kissing the top of her ass.</p> <p>"Oh, Eddy," I smiled.</p> <p>"This is the way to get out of trouble," she said.</p> <p>I lowered to my knees and began kissing and licking her bare buttocks. When I reached her pussy I found it already clean shaven and just as clean-shaven as her face. I licked and kissed her pussy and then began to suck on her clitoris. This sent her over the edge. In a few seconds Eddy let out a small cry and shuddered hard. I immediately resumed my licking and sucking on her clitoris.</p> <p>"I'm cumming," she announced.</p> <p>"Now I'm in trouble," I said, continuing to lick her clitoris with my tongue until it became almost painful.</p> <p>A few seconds later Eddy came with a high pitched wail and then turned to me. She leaned on the edge of her bed, turned away from me and began to pull something out of her underwear drawer. I was too confused to follow as she pulled it out and brought it back to me, turned it over and laid it onto her bedside table.</p> <p>I sat down beside her. She laid down on her bed and spread her legs.</p> <p>"You look so good," I whispered into her ear.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"So do you like?" "</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Eddy</p> <p>We should stay with your</p> <p></p> <p><</p> <p>My answer:</p> <p></p> <p>"But I'll have Ey/ I want</p> <p></p> <p>E I  “Come with</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"I</p> <p>I…—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
