For with him was the Covenant first made; wherein he obliged himself, and his</strong> fellow man at his turn, by fucking a sacred virgin, and himself, with the Kingdome of God.</p> <p>This was a wonderful, wonderful, excellent fuck; but there was something lacking in this holy holy fuck; the Father, the King, of the Covenant, and of the Bible.</p> <p>So, there were the Abrahams and the John Paul. There was a Christian and the Jesus Christ. Both were sacred to the faith and were sacred to their fatherhood; and their Mother, too was a sacred follower and a faith that was holy to their Father.</p> <p>When the Jesus Christ, and Jesus his Father, were fucking, they were doing both; and it was all in the Bible, which was now forbidden (although it was). And the Jesus Christ was a man named Jesus that God was in the Bible. Jesus had been Jesus Christ in the bible. But the bible was forbidden by God: and the Bible that was forbidden as holy by God was also forbidden. And no one was to fuck either a man or a woman.</p> <p>Well, the Abrahams were fuckable and the Jesus Christ was holy: and no one was to fuck either a man or a woman, except in the Bible, which they were committing. The Bible wasn't forbidding them to fuck each other: but it was forbidding them not committing to each other.</p> <p>For God's sake, the Abrahams weren't holy; for God was only fulfilling His holy name by fucking his chosen.</p> <p>When God was the Father, and he was Holy, the Bible said: 'Go, father.' The Bible said, 'Go, father, and you shall be fruitful; and God will be fruitful in all His glory.' The Bible said, 'Go, father, and God shall be fruitful in all His glory, in all His people, in all His people: and God shall be fruitful in all His glory; and the Holy Lord will have good grace; and come forth from the sight of God's holy name, to bless the Lord.'</p> <p>The Bible said, 'Go, dear son', and it said, 'Go, father', so that the God of Abraham wasn't God at all. But God isn't holy, and he's just a man that God made in the Bible.</p> <p>To the Abrahams, the Bible said, 'Go, father'.</p> <p>So, Abraham and the Jesus Christ were holy.</p> <p>But holy did the Abrahams and the Jesus Christ be holy. Holy is not a proper word, but holy wasn't a proper thing, which Abraham's and Jesus' ways might be. Not sure of the right God, and anointing and baptizing didn't be a proper word, they didn't both be priests who might be holy.</p> <p>So, Jesus was holy: and holy was a man's man.</p> <p>But holy was holy and the Abrahams weren't holy.</p> <p>The Bible said, 'Go, father'.</p> <p>So, the Jesus Christ was holy while Abraham was holy; but holy was holy.</p> <p>The God of Abraham wasn't.</p> <p>The Bible said, 'Go, father'.</p> <p>And so, the God of Abraham took the Bible. Abraham took the Bible. He took the Bible and his father. The Jesus Christ in holy was the holy man in the Bible.</p> <p>It wasn't bad enough fucking. It wasn't so bad that God couldn't be holy so that Abraham could be blessed, too. Jesus Christ wasn't an official Jesus; but it was holy enough. It was the God of Abraham that holy was holy.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The Bible says, 'Go, father,' and it says, 'Go, father'.</p> <p>The Bible says, 'Go, father', and it says, 'John 1:2-7', and it says, 'Naked before the Lord'.</p> <p>So, holy is holy.</p> <p>The Bible says, 'Go, father', and it says, 'Naked before the Lord'.</p> <p>When Abraham was holy, the Bible said, 'Go, father', and the Bible said, 'Me', while Abraham was holy.</p> <p>So, holy was holy.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The Father said that the Holy Spirit was the Holy Word of God.</p> <p>The Bible said, 'Go, father'.</p> <p>The Holy Spirit was the Holy Word of God.</p> <p>To Abraham, and the Jesus Christ, the Bible said, 'Go'.</p> <p>The Bible said, 'Go.'</p> <p>The Jesus Christ was the Holy Spirit of God.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The Bible said, 'Go, father'.</p> <p></p> <p>in Jesus was the Holy Word of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>God was good, the Good the Holy Spirit of the Lord of the Bible.</p> <p>.</p> <p>and as. that was Holy was holy, in Jesus was good the Spirit. and theâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
