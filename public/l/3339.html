The Curse of the Baskervilles</h4><p><strong>“I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer. “I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes. “It is an old manuscript.” “Early eighteenth century, unless</strong> that is the case,” added Mr. Holmes. “No one has ever read a manuscript before.” “Not all manuscripts contain sex scenes,” said Mr. Holmes. “And I have studied many a literary journal. Only one.”</p> <p>“I also noticed the mention of ‘slutting',” stated Mr. Holmes.</p> <p>“You’ve read that one already,” said Mr. Holmes. “Have you not?”</p> <p>“Never,” sighed Dr. James Mortimer. “Not one.”</p> <p>“Well, I read that one too,” said Mr. Mortimer. “I thought you wanted the sex to be a bit of a surprise.”</p> <p>“I would rather do it at home,” said Mr. Holmes. “In your home, I mean.”</p> <p>“Then I will be waiting,” said Dr. Mortimer. “But I'm sure I will enjoy myself.”</p> <p>That was the thought that eventually convinced Dr. Mortimer that her first time should be on a beach in Hawaii.</p> <p>“Good.”</p> <p>“Good?”</p> <p>“Yes, good,” Dr. Mortimer said. “What I want is to make the story interesting but not, as you see, a rape story.”</p> <p>“No,” said Mr. Holmes, “I’m sure you’ll make it interesting.”</p> <p>“Okay,” Dr. Mortimer said, still trying to figure out her own story. “I’m going to make all this happen,” she said.</p> <p>“I’d like to,” said Mr. Holmes, already on the point of having one last fling with Dr. Mortimer. “I mean, do you know,” said Holmes reaching out toward the doctor, with his left hand, “if a woman would be willing to fuck her husband, or otherwise, and I’d like to have sex with her husband, if he would, I’d like to do it for her, and I, believe it or not, am looking for other people to share the experience with.”</p> <p>“Hmmmmmmm,” said Dr. Mortimer. “That would be fine with me.”</p> <p>“That is quite the possibility with a woman, doesn’t it?”</p> <p>“Well, I’d hate to have to make the choice to have sex with another man just for that pleasure without having to ask and feel for the same sex.”</p> <p>“Really? I certainly would be happy to share this experience with you, but it would be nice if the situation never happened.”</p> <p>“You, yourself, have great taste in the subject.” Mr. Holmes said as he reached out and gently grasped Dr. Mortimer’s right hand by his wrist and moved it up toward his face.</p> <p>“I’m not ready for this,” thought Dr. Mortimer as Mr. Holmes’ hand moved up and down her arm. “I don’t know what it would be like to have sex with another woman, and I don’t know what it would be like with another man.”</p> <p>“Oh, but with an opportunity,” said Mr. Holmes, “I could show you something about women’s desires in a very educational way.”</p> <p>But the doctor was more interested in her new friend than in finding out how to make this happen.</p> <p>“I, I mean, I’m a little confused and a little nervous, but,” she said, moving her left hand away from his wrist, and began to reach for her blouse button, “if you want to know, all you have to do is look at this article in a historical way and your friend is out of the room, and you’ll have the opportunity to have sex with one of us, someone in your life. I'm all ears.”</p> <p>“It wouldn’t be right.”</p> <p>“Why?”</p> <p>“Because I would have to fuck you, as all men are supposed to, and that would not mean what it is an incredible,” said Holmes, moving her right hand out of her jacket button and revealing two pink blouse. ‘biting and now lace top’s breast, and all the most cleavage’, now the right breast, and left nipple. ”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
