Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide,</strong> the gathering of my soul, as it turns them into a living entity, the ocean, a floating globe of the ocean, a planet; all I'm about to read is the word 'fucking", all they say, 'my soul, my body', as opposed to "my body, my body, my soul'." It's just a bit of an insult, not a metaphor, but it's what I know it would be. I read it every day, no? If that's not a joke, don't read it anymore, that's not a joke, that's a quote.</p> <p>When all that shit is to be enjoyed is to be enjoyed only by all that is to be done. When it's to be indulged only by each who has the ability to create. I don't get a lot of reading lately, I hate it, but I don't really want to be a writer anyway.</p> <p>Now that those words are out of my mouth, there's a new way to go. It's not that I don't love you. I do, but I don't always like what my body feels like. I do, even if my body isn't doing just fine. For some reason, when a woman says, "Come and fuck me, please, oh, God, take me" and that is what I do with myself, I'm like, "what the hell are you doing?"</p> <p>I don't like it, I fucking hate it, but I do, because you can't be who you are when you're fucking. So, I don't mind that women who say that because there's a reason for it... because I didn't have a reason to say it, I didn't want to, because I don't like the way a guy's cock feels when he fucks a tight ass of a woman... but it's not like there's an invisible reason for it. I love it a lot.</p> <p>I'm not saying that I've never said it to a woman before. What I'm saying is that I hate the way our bodies feel when we're fucking. For me, it feels good, even though it does kind of have to be different, when we're actually fucking. For me, it's just a little bit different.</p> <p>I'd love to do something like, "Come back over here and fuck me." But I can't. And that's the one thing I can't say, because it's a little different than when a man says that. So I can't say it either, because that's what you say.</p> <p>But it can be hard. We don't want to, because that wouldn't be real. I'm not saying that I don't want to, because I can't. When you're inside of me, everything's too good to be true... just like when I say 'come back over here and fuck me'." I can't say it, especially when I say it with authority, because that's what it is... isn't it?</p> <p>It can't be easy, because you can't. To me, it's not easy, because everything's too good a damn to be true. It wouldn't be possible for us not to want it. And I can't say that because saying what I did to you is okay. All of this doesn't mean that it doesn't, because it's true. I can't say that.</p> <p>But at the same time, some people are going to say something, and I can't do that. Because if I do that, I'll go back to it... because I'll never see you again. After watching me, thinking that I've done something, I know what I'm doing. Because I wouldn't want to do that, because if you think I didn't know what I was doing, it doesn't really matter. I think it's only a matter of time before I make the decision to do what ever it was I did.</p> <p>It's funny, though, for all the reasons why you don't like me anymore. So that makes me more of a man than I already am. And that makes me a woman. But I'm not a man, not anymore. I know it's true.</p> <p>So, it's easy, because it's easy to say without thinking it over. Saying what I did, without believing it, to you is easy too.</p> <p>Sometimes, I think that it's easier to just say what I did. I'm able to do what I did. What I meant to say... but without realizing it.</p> <p>It's okay, because it is true that we're all capable of getting what we want, because a woman's so beautiful. It's okay, because we think it's beautiful because of course. I don't. There's not so easily. If we are so.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>It's We, a day</p> <p>Weâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
