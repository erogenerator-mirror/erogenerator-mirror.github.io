We had the occasion to see you standing here in that white-carpeted room. You were dressed in the most beautiful gown of any time period you have been standing here. The moment you saw that gown, you knew immediately which gown meant 'I've just had a great evening', you were ready to dress for the occasion! You made the first move for the dress gown in the same moment, in what seemed like a couple of minutes. A lovely romantic moment. You stood to a side, looking me directly in the eyes, your arms behind you, back to me, your shoulders back slightly, hands resting on your sides and behind. "Oh, my", I thought, "That's just how your grandmother dresses nowadays. I'm ready to be dressed for tonight." Yes. I am!"</p> <p>I kissed your forehead, your eyes, nose and chin, your lips. "I'm ready to be ready for tonight". You stood to your full height, at about 3'2", wearing a pair of flowing light brown tresses which you pulled back into a ponytail. You walked around me, taking in the sight. I stood behind you, my body pressed against your back. I was the picture of beauty. I leaned to kiss the head of your right shoulder, which was right above your left cheek. You turned slowly, not saying anything. I put a hand on your waist and continued to follow the path of your left hip and right hip. You are one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen; even though I had the vision many times, but now, I could not compare to the picture in front of me of you in your soft light brown panties. You were such a lovely woman who was almost perfect in her body.</p> <p>Your fingers were on the button that button me blouse, gently undoing it. With my hands, I opened the remaining button and opened the top of your lovely blouse. You held my head close and placed your lips on mine. We met, as tenderly and slowly as we were kissing just a short time back. After, we parted and I looked at your beautiful face and you looked back at me. I reached for the hem from the waistband of your panties. And after a bit of hesitation, I looked at you and saw a tear forming under your left eye. I bent to kiss the tear, as softly as I could. I moved my lips to your cheek and slowly licked it. I felt like a butterfly, on the delicate part of your skin. I made it. You kissed me back, passionately. Without a bit of hesitation, I brought out my right hand and gently caressed your breasts, feeling the texture between the fabric. "There is something else, baby," you said, in a small, soft voice. "something else" and I continued. You slowly unbuttoned and took off your blouse. You looked back at me as I looked at your beautiful, white, perfect body revealed to me...</p> <p>I felt a slight tingle. Your face flushed a little and you looked nervous a little, but a big smile spread across your mouth. "Here, this is the way the ceremony is going. I know how your grandmother's gown is made. And we are both going to enjoy it, as your grandmother does... " I looked back at you and placed a hand on your neck. You had a big smile that seemed to get bigger and bigger as I slowly moved my hand up to your left breast. You held my hand to your body, and in no time, my hand was playing on one breast, with your left breast being the caress at hand. In order to get your nipples, to play with them and to feel your breasts... I placed my palm on one boob and massaged it through the fabric of your dress. I felt as if I was playing for hours. I started kissing you, our lips met, as though we were trying to kiss each other in the middle of the night. We both felt a little bit shy, perhaps, you.</p> <p>I kept moving my fingers around the fabric of the material of the dress, feeling your skin, enjoying the soft texture of my hands on you. You still wore a veil, and I had to adjust my position to see your face better. I was not sure if you felt awkward about the kissing, or if you were enjoying it. But I had no doubts. I would be a bit drunk if I didn't keep an eye on you while I would kiss you.</p> <p>As I looked at you, you were smiling sweetly, but you were still looking worried that I was looking at your face and your boobs. I looked down at your face to see your lips were closed, as still smiling. I put my hand was touching your left boob, now, but slowly playing on your boobs but with the dress over the veil.
