The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by twilight the</strong> sky darkened; and finally twilight became a brilliant blaze of color as it turned to white. The storm was strong but mercifully gentle; neither saw it as being violent; as they saw a calm peace and tranquility that transcended the storm. The snow and snow melted on their faces and hair in a seemingly endless haze; as it enveloped their bones and they slept. In time with the steady rain, it became obvious that neither felt the effects of hypothermia; as it slowly became dusk. It was the day of reckoning, and they were the first to celebrate.</p> <p>"So, does that help you? Would you like me to put up with the snow?" St. John asked.</p> <p>"Yes, it helps me to sleep better."</p> <p>"I'll go get a warm bath in the kitchen. Would you like me to do it?"</p> <p>"Yes, please."</p> <p>As the night before began to rain, St. John took off his robe; and after placing it in the laundry hamper he stepped into the bathtub filled with the white icy water that they had always used as a special bathtub in the past. He held his arms up in the hot water and held his shoulders back, just as a bathtub is now. St. John was beginning to drift as he looked down at his chest as the water droplets rippled from his head down to his upper torso and finally to his cock; which was very hard indeed. He rubbed his hand up and down its length, looking at himself in the mirror he made from pictures of his mother in the past and remembering the times of love and romance. The old romantic stories he always enjoyed about his mother made their way onto his brain as he looked into the mirror.</p> <p>"This can't be good, mom would die," he whispered to himself. He moved his right arm to his chest and moved his hand up and down his shaft as he sat in the tub, relaxing and enjoying the warmth of the water. As he looked at his reflection, a little thrill raced through his young body as she passed into the shower and let the water splash against his exposed chest. It startled him somewhat, his eyes were closed and his head tilted back.</p> <p>As he continued to stare at his naked body in the mirrored bathroom mirror, his cock began to slowly get hard; in that instant it became extremely hard and standing up completely rigid. St. John felt his testicles tighten more with each beat of his heart; in this moment of intense excitement they did not care to care about any other emotion; they only seemed to enjoy the warm pleasure the water gave them. He put his hand on his shaft and began to massage it as he imagined sucking it dry. In his mind's eye, he could see his mother's face as she held onto the shower seat; her face looked lost into his eyes as she took his hard cock in her mouth. St. John closed his eyes and imagined he was fucking her mouth with his cock; he could feel his cock head rubbing against the thin membrane of flesh separating the two flesh. His hands on his shaft made their way back down to his balls; it felt so good to be doing this; as though he was masturbating with his hand.</p> <p>"What would you say if something happened to mom?" he whispered.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know, we can't risk the storm. Don't you think it must be okay?"</p> <p>"Of course it's not okay. Just the opposite, it's not the storm that worries me at all. Mom says it's the weather, but in her opinion it all changes," he replied.</p> <p>His hand went down to his balls, feeling the heavy muscles tighten as his body began the familiar spasm-like motion of ejaculation. It had been over ten years since he had felt a sexual reaction like the orgasm he was experiencing that day. Each time he reached the point of ejaculation, it seemed as if a fire would ignite deep within his body, the electric shocks that coursed through him as if they were being electrocuted in an electric shock. But, at the height of the explosion of euphoria, it felt even more like the last one of the day before, before the last one of the night. St. John's hand continued its slow rhythmic movements across his shaft to a steady beat as his body prepared to be carried away by the intensity of the spasm, which was quickly becoming stronger and more frequent each time he reached the point of ejaculation. The final moment of orgasm approached and then a loud cry of release escaped his lips. It felt as if his whole body was on fire as it seized up and squeezed and contracted. He squeezed tightly as the walls of the warm water tight channel of his balls, clutching body. It became a hot and in return of intense, tight, wet, wet, clinging embrace that grip on his entire being, on his cock. He ejaculate exploded; his body—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
