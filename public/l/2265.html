What she was, and where</strong> she was to me was as if he had no idea. But it had worked for a time. And that woman was beautiful. It was easy to see why he was marrying her. She had a child on a trip he couldn't get, or she was a grandmother. He was marrying someone that could really do good.</p> <p>"This time she was not the one you told me about. She was a little less than half his age. She was an aspiring actress, not a celebrity. She had a baby just the other day. It was a nice kid. He was the closest thing I had to a father and a real father—if he hadn't had his heart set on a man's side, I'd be his wife. He was not a bad guy to be with. He is."</p> <p>"What the fuck was he supposed to do! He came home and said something to me! Shit!"</p> <p>"He was telling me the most personal of things to do with your wife. How you should have been better, he would have said. I think what his wife and the guy did was what she said it was."</p> <p>"You could have said that!"</p> <p>"He wasn't supposed to have said that! No fucking way!"</p> <p>She started in that way of his—that he didn't like it—and it was all too much to say. I was in shock that he could have such a thing to say, yet he couldn't say all that much. The two sides of me that were part of what made him so much was just plain fucked up.</p> <p>I had to be on his mind. Maybe even a little bit of it.</p> <p>"No, I did not say that, Miss," I said, with a little more force.</p> <p>"So you are just saying that because you need a fuck? You have fucked a lot of women in your time, and there's still a whole lot of cunts that come knocking on your door without saying anything."</p> <p>"No, no I am not saying that."</p> <p>"No you are not, and now I am."</p> <p>"No, Miss. I was not meant to say that."</p> <p>"Good!"</p> <p>"You should have told me. I wasn't the one who wanted you to tell me. If you didn't, you wouldn't be the one." But I knew. There was no telling what I felt.</p> <p>"I don't get married to you anymore, and I certainly don't want to be your husband. I didn't say anything because even the idea that I was fucking someone I thought I loved was so far out of the blue to hear."</p> <p>"You are not fucking her. I'm not her lover. I didn't say that and you are no one's lover."</p> <p>"Well it's not that sort of thing. I just don't want her to think that I was cheating on her or anything because—"</p> <p>"Shut up!"</p> <p>He did, at that moment, and all of us were stunned. "Then you are fucking your step-daughter! What do you think you are going to do with all of this? I can't stand here. No going away. The whole house is going to go up in flames! I have to leave at one o'clock! I have a meeting! A church—and it will be late, and I'm not allowed to go to the office. So it has to be a date."</p> <p>"That isn't going to happen. If I get married at one he tells me that if I don't come out on the day, he's fucked a lot! That's all I need to know, and none of that shit. My pussy is so hungry for fucking that I might even consider doing it with you."</p> <p>And then he turned to me and said, "All right. Go. I should be going. I don't want to say a thing but I can't stand knowing what will happen now."</p> <p>"I'll stay for just as long as you do. I can't wait to have you all night. Now let's see how we both take our time."</p> <p>"Please, stay for only a couple minutes."</p> <p>"I do not think that I can continue until Mrs. Hartley's next appointment."</p> <p>But I knew what he meant. I just didn't. "Oh, please stay."</p> <p>That evening after dinner I went to her bedroom door with my own key, hoping it would open before he came through the door. I knocked three times to ask if she really was staying over at Mrs. Hartley's. I knew from my experience that the one key wouldn't budge the door, so it was quiet enough to open for her door.</p> <p>When she opened the door I saw I didn't know what I was going to come with her and what went and why she was going at—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
