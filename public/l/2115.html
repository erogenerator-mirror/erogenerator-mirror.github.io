When at any time thou art offended with any one’s impudency, put</h4><p><strong>presently this question to thyself: ’What? Is it then possible, that there should not be any impudent men in the world! Certainly it is not possible.’ Desire not then that</strong> they have a common bond.'</p> <p>'Oh, yes,' said, as she pushed him toward the door by the bed: 'there is no such thing, if the God himself has done thus and such as he has yet created in his way of doing the things which are called Gods. I say, as I was born, I cannot even claim that.'</p> <p>Indeed they were not.</p> <p>They were certainly not.</p> <p>And then, he came upon the bed again, and her, as their eyes met on their first moment together, they became the gods.</p> <p>Chapter 14:</p> <p>Eryca smiled, not content to pretend to be so. This was the first time he was ever to fuck her ass. And he was not, as the other men thought. They all knew that, but that made no difference to her. It only made her want to do so more and more and more. With no real intention of having any of them fuck her back: she wanted to just take it, so to speak. And, if they ever got to do that with her, all her men will be very pleased, to say nothing of their own.</p> <p>Still, it was with a greater sense of wonder, delight, and joy that she stood and took his huge, hard cock in her hands. He was huge. Her head was already resting on his thighs, a place for her hands, the same place where they were used by now her ass before, to enjoy the size and length and fullness of him. She was not so much a god as a god of love it seemed. And to feel it filling her up in such a way - he was already fucking her! This was all worth it! The thought made her blush in a way that could only be seen in some dark room of a temple.</p> <p>The man had no desire to be inside her now, that her insides were on fire, that the pleasure she was experiencing was all that existed. But for herself she was going to be his whore. She had already done that - the first time she had ever done it - and he had fucked her. And as she took him there in the bed with the other men, their thoughts continued on and on about themselves, and their passion grew.</p> <p>Now though, as he fucked her, she began to want, to care for, his. He knew that, even if it did not change everything between them now. Not all of them would. The thought made her blush again, for with her eyes closed it showed that this was something she did not desire. This was a symbol, not merely a thing to signify the truth of the nature which she had just done. With his cock inside her, and with her eyes upon it she saw the beauty of it. She saw that he could see it now and how he could see it. The love which she had felt when he was within her, the love which she had felt when he used her. It was as she saw it now she wanted it all. That love that she held within herself.</p> <p>Her eyes closed now in silent longing. No man could have failed to feel her love in a different way. The love so pure, it was not for just the cock but for the whole of her body which was still on fire in that instant: the pleasure she felt, and was still feeling: her mind and her soul, all of her being, her soul. That moment would be no more for this one man. He could not deny it. He could not deny himself an opportunity to fuck her. She could not deny herself her loving.</p> <p>Yet, in that moment, he felt his own excitement rising at the prospect she had just given him. In that moment he felt something else rising within him as well. A hunger which he had never before felt. It had always been within himself, but always within himself. It seemed to him that he wanted him to be inside her now. To fuck and fuck and to fuck.</p> <p>His mouth did not miss one instant of her eyes closed in pleasure, for the movement of his hips was accompanied by a sudden movement to his own hips, and he knew that he was coming. He felt himself spurting his seed deep within her. Then a second time, it was also a third and even a fourth time and a fifth time, and she was crying out with pleasure: with happiness, of this world. His body trembled with delight. He felt as though his soul had no more to be held. He realized too that the pleasure of it was real and that it was real for all of them to now know. He had found love in those moments, for he had known it in love at first sight. A feeling that had never soarsened like that he had seen to a second-sight, yet again, this second time, so that he had seen something so had seen through to see. He had always seen, so had seen, but had seen only—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
