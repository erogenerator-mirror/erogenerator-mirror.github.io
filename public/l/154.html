Dusk</h4><p><strong>The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no sound; and so strong</strong> was that feeling, as strong as her own body had been, it was weak. That feeling of weakness. It was such a weakness of which there could no ordinary person in the world, could there? Then, there were the tears, which could not be her own?</p> <p>As if their existence depended upon it, her blood was no less determined to be weak than her spirit, as if her heart was no less solid than her blood; and, she knew from her own body to be stronger than she had ever been. But there was still the fear as the tears fell. Her fear of death. She knew now how hopeless this was. Death, as if there would never be an end to it, was the only thing that would stop her.</p> <p>No, this was better than death. Death was her destiny. Death was her escape. Death would be her own for as long as God or whatever she wished existed in the universe. Death is everything.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Do you want to do it, Mom?"</p> <p>"Yes!" she replied in a firm voice. "Please, put it in me. Please fuck my fucking ass. Please fuck your own mothermy. Please fill me up. Please! I love you. Please!" she exclaimed in a very sincere voice. "I love you so fucking much!"</p> <p>"Yes. I love you, too, Mom. But, Mom, we have to be careful. There's too much happening to us right now. Everything must be perfect. Just go slow!"</p> <p>"Okay, I suppose," she replied shyly. "I'll go slow."</p> <p>"I'm going to go slow. First I'm going to do all the work," he told her, his own mind still processing the whole scenario. "Then, I'll take the plunge. Then, I'm going to open your eyes and see what happens."</p> <p>It didn't help at all to have any other choice, the choice of the day. No one could have imagined how this would affect her life with such a sudden turn of events. Even if it was not necessarily good, and would indeed be great even a week or two later, she would die with him. She would be his baby, his precious little girl.</p> <p>She was so confused, and angry. She would be his child; his daughter. He would marry her. In short, yes, in short, yes indeed she would be conceived. But, all those thoughts and all those feelings of desire that she had about him, were buried in the back of her mind at that second. If, he had asked them to make her, it would have been difficult to force the incestuous feelings, but it would have been difficult.</p> <p>He had been a wonderful father. If only she could have gotten his seed, she would have probably married him again even sooner than now. Yet, she wondered if he would ask her to fuck him, too. If she could get him pregnant again, then he would do as he was told and let her. It would be so good to have him as a father again.</p> <p>She would be his baby; his baby in her little home. He would never give him up. He wouldn't marry her just so that she could make him pregnant again, right away. He was too devoted to do the things that he wanted to do.</p> <p>He would take care of her. He would take care of his wonderful baby. With the only man that she loved, he was that man. With her, she wanted him to take care of her. They would have a good life. He would help make it.</p> <p>"Yes. Baby," she answered with a smile. "Oh, yes. That's what I'm looking for."</p> <p>He would give everything he was willing to do to make her happy. He really felt the same way as he did that night. This was a real woman's day, she thought. A real woman, who in the last two years, had fucked more than one man; three women, and four men, at the same time. The difference was, it was only the fact that she was his mother, that she needed to have sex every day.</p> <p>With her son taking care of her and her son fucking and fucking, she would have a new purpose in life. She would have new purpose in life.</p> <p>It was her fault, and her fault. This has always been her fault. No matter how hard she tried to come up with something to say, she couldn't get past the words. Their very words that she needed to say had to do with sex, not the words.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do that? Or is it?" so called out loud by her. the question, not to her. in a voice in front, but to the mother, for what she was. as the moment before, to what was a child, the question wasâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
