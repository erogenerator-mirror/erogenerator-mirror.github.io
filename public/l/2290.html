I went to the Heights as I proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady, and</strong> I gave her the note. She gave it to me, smiled, and I thought, in the back of my mind how she had done it by being me for life in her own way: I had made a mistake with that letter, but I never knew what had gone wrong with it – or whether to happen again.</p> <p>"Here," I told her, "You should bring a friend as well. She's cute, like her father, but it's good to know that she still likes me more than you do... I'll be happy to share. Or you can share yourself with that one, too... she knows where I live!"</p> <p>"I'd like that, thank you!" she said, "Of course we should talk before..."</p> <p>"Of course not. This means you have got to come to my home to discuss matters," I said. My mind was in turmoil, I would like her very much to come to my home, and I knew that there was no way in hell that I would want her, yet she was all I hoped I would find for myself.</p> <p>"Well... I'll... try. What do you think?"</p> <p>She was nervous. She really wanted this. To give her the whole thing, to see what it felt like to give herself to me. This meant that it was a bit risky, which was why I was holding back with my tongue, though she said the word "pussy". I took off my trousers and knickers, took out my cock and gave it a good rub – she didn't know the word "pussy" and she didn't really want it. I took a big glob of spit from my mouth and I squirted a bit around the head of my cock and on her pussy. I had her lie down on her back, took off her bra, and rubbed a glob of spit in her cleft. I pushed her legs apart as wide as she could get them, looked into her eyes, and rubbed the saliva down my cock, and then got the head into her. She was wet, she was eager, and I pushed into her slowly, very gently, letting her enjoy the sensation of being fucked for the first time by a man for the first time in her life.</p> <p>It was so sexy being made love to, by a woman for the first time. It was an amazing experience. There was something about this, something that I never felt about the woman I slept with before. It was something which is completely new to me, and I never thought I'd ever get the opportunity to be anything but a man's plaything with a woman so close to me... but now she was letting herself be fucked by me, I didn't have much time to think but the feeling was too much.</p> <p>I started to thrust as hard as I could, I'd forgotten what it felt like to be a girl, I hadn't even thought about it, but I found myself coming faster than I ever had in my whole life. It was a dream. I made her come again, and once again we were on fire, making love, fucking, making one of the most intense mutual orgasms of our lives.</p> <p>I knew she had an orgasm, but I wanted to be sure that the sensation lasted. I wanted us both to come again, and I knew she must be close, I was close.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus, I'm coming," she cried.</p> <p>I said the words but they sounded so pathetic.</p> <p>"Don't think that because I'm going to fuck you, I'm going to fuck you," I said, "Fuck me!"</p> <p>I didn't know that I had said them just the last part, but it felt like the best way to describe it. She looked back at me, she was almost as close to orgasm as I was, "Oh, Peter, I'm coming... Peter... it's been so, so, so long..."</p> <p>And it was true. It was really as long as she had come to this, but it was also as many times she had never even thought she'd have the opportunity to try it again, it had been so long since she had felt anything like this. As she was coming, so did I, too.</p> <p>We were both breathing heavy, as was I, with her coming down from her orgasm and me on the way up to full climax. I held her close, gently, and I whispered in her ear. "Is this really the best way?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, it is, it really IS," she said.</p> <p>We were both still for a bit, I think we had just a few minutes to spare, we still hadn't really even finished to go any further. I think, and I wasn't finished, so we just rolled to each take our next our clothes off. We moved to the sofa, we were on the sofa, still on and we—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
