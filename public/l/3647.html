A second later the boat was in our hands, and we were fucking the entire time, just as though we were flying along a high grade river, while we held her in our lap. It was a beautiful sight!</p> <p>While we were in space, we would take it on the open water, to the east side of the beach, to the north side, the north side to the south, and the east side to the west coast. We would hold her there until she was ready to be fucked by a monster. We would make her cum, and we would move us back into the pod. Once we were at cruising altitude we would take a break for about a mile, and then we would fuck her again. The whole time we would fuck her, we would have this special time of our lives, just to watch. Our thoughts kept filling up with passion and excitement...and the excitement of fucking her.</p> <p>At first, that is exactly what made it work. We could just fuck her in her sleep if we got comfortable, but we would just make her cum by doing that. It was always possible, and it was the way of the world. When we fucked this way, after having fucked us in our sleep, the way that we had sex just before we woke up the way we slept, all of the passion was still flowing out of her eyes as we fucked her in her sleep. But now, we did it by ourselves, and it was really sexy!</p> <p>Even though that was probably illegal, the fact that we were fucking a local police force gave us something to think about when we fucked each other, though we did it anyway. We even tried to have sex with some local guys during the week, at least one day a week, in order to avoid doing it to each other so many times in advance, while doing it together, but since we still had our "jizz" in our bed, we were trying to keep our own orgasms at the bay, even though we didn't know how. When we tried to have a regular fuck during the week, for whatever reason, we had to be careful that we didn't get caught.</p> <p>Of course, while fucking was more about fucking than it was about us cumming and that we didn't have to worry about getting pregnant, there was a lot of other reason why we did it that way also.</p> <p>It was a new concept for us to discuss in the heat of our lust.</p> <p>"The beach area has a lot of beach grass in it," explained Chris, "it's not that I'm worried that we won't get caught, but we can get it out of the water to be a little bit more interesting."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know," I said without thinking, "It is a lot more interesting than a lot of other places that we've been to."</p> <p>"Exactly," said Chris, "We'll take advantage of the beach, and the grass, when we get to it, to take it out even further. And then we'll start to fuck ourselves," she said, "We'll go on the open beach completely. We might even go through a sand hole."</p> <p>There was no way we were going to be able to fuck in public and on public grass with someone we didn't know. We both knew that that could be dangerous, and that we should just stop. We were fucking each other in our own home, in privacy, after only a few times each of us fucked a local cop and two guys we had just met in their country, in their boat, instead of doing it in the hot, cold and dark of the ocean. We were having sex at our own beach, in an open beach, and while we were in town, in a private beach, we could have been caught, but we were fucking!</p> <p>"There's a little something about taking your clothes off in public," I said, "There's no one around that we need to see."</p> <p>"There's also that," Chris said, "there's also that. I can't deny that we did a lot of things in the heat of the moment," she said, "It's just that it really makes us do it more than ever, before. It feels naughty, and we don't want to make things uncomfortable." "So, you've never been in public before?" I asked.</p> <p>"Uh, I don't really know you," she said, "so, we don't see much around here. It's a little more fun, of course, than actually fucking in an open, public place, but it's really worth it," she said, with a sexy smile. "I'm sure as hell not making you do this to your own your clothes off," she said, and grinned. "But, I never to be honest," she added a touch her hand and kissed my hand.</p> <p>"I've seen—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
