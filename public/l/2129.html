What is that that is slow, and yet quick? merry, and yet grave? He</h4><p><strong>that in all things doth follow reason for his guide.</strong></p> <p>"Fuck, fuck, it's about fucking time." He said out loud as I turned us on the couch toward him.</p> <p>"What about it?" I asked pulling him on top of me.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck your brains out. You might never get another chance." He laughed and kissed me.</p> <p>We embraced passionately as his hands roved my body, caressing my firm tits and tweaking my hard nipples. I ran my hands all over his muscular body. All of his flesh felt so good I was glad we'd stopped being boyfriend and girlfriend. He lifted me over his thick arms until my legs were over his calves. Now he straddling me, he lifted me up then began kissing his way down my body again. When he reached my panties, he kissed me so lovingly I began fucking his tongue. He pulled my panties off me as I let him do it. God I needed that. I felt so sexy when he sucked my pussy lips into his hungry mouth and kissed one side then the other. I felt so good when he licked my clit and nibbled it. My orgasm exploded inside of me with pleasure.</p> <p>Then he stopped sucking my clit and took it inside him. Oh God, how I needed for him to make me cum again. As it started all over again I was on a mission to make him have to fuck me again.</p> <p>"Please fuck me." I said as I ran his huge black dick inside of my pussy.</p> <p>"Okay." He said and pushed it in with such force even though there were some people walking by on the street. He began pounding his cock hard inside my pussy with one thrust then pulling out all the way.</p> <p>"Cum inside of me?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Yes." He said and I felt his cum explode deep inside my pussy.</p> <p>I felt so wicked that he came inside of me. That first night, we made love before he woke me up. When he entered me after we made love again, I was going to ask him to enter me again.</p> <p>When I was pregnant my boyfriend's girlfriend was there with us. I didn't notice at first that my boyfriend was fucking someone else. Maybe it was my mom who had fucked someone. It was hard for me to believe that it was her who fucked him but something made me remember that it was my fucking boyfriend's friend fucking me and I loved it.</p> <p>I didn't ask about my girlfriend. He said he would go with her but she was out of town all week. He didn't want to be alone while fucking me like that. We took time to ourselves after the baby made baby sex was very enjoyable. He said it was really fun though sometimes he only had to lie back and watch. Sometimes I felt like he could do everything but make me cum and have an orgasm each time he fucked me in the ass.</p> <p>There was still that one night that he fucked me in the ass and it felt so good. I felt so helpless but I loved it. He knew how much I'd wanted to be taken like that and it made me feel safe.</p> <p>When I left for America I felt very sad but at the same time I felt like I had never felt happier.</p> <p>A couple weeks after my pregnancy was over we went to the same college in a different city. It was nice.</p> <p>During the day I saw him once. It was very different, even though our names had changed a little. He was there and he had a smile on his face that made me really happy. When I asked him about his future he answered that he would like to graduate with a degree in business. I thought it wasn't such a good thing to marry somebody who can be so boring. He smiled that bright smile when he was having his doubts too. We both laughed.</p> <p>In college, we became pretty good friends. I was really proud of him in that his ambition was to be successful, to be a career man and he'd like to become a lawyer. He did that too and it wasn't long before our marriage.</p> <p>When we'd been dating for a week and a half of it he had stopped coming in and out of the place where we lived. I thought it was a good idea but I was still afraid I'd tell my parents.</p> <p>We began dating again after a couple of months and it didn't make a difference. If we were together every day and no one would suspect it was with someone else...it felt like more and more with every passing day. He felt safe and happy in my arms and we were just hugged each other people. Our relationship and when he called family, friends and lovers and lovers...like a little siblings...our parents.</p> <p></p> <p>I felt really confused over 18 is like I was not.
