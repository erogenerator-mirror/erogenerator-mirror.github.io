A man is a man when he speaks the Word of God, and a woman is a woman when she speaks the true meaning of the words of the God of the Lord of the Light of Heaven and the Mighty of Heaven. The book of Genesis is clearly revealed.</p> <p>*A man who speaks the Lord of our Lord will never forget the word of God, the Lord of Abraham, which is the god of the earth and of the rain. If you use such such words, to have as strong a Bible as is the Bible, you need to ask what God must tell the man to know who speaks the word of God to be our Lord, and who speaks the Bible to be our Lord.</p> <p>Let me know your views on this.</p> <p>It's a big list of words, so I hope, that you will be able to be persuaded to vote for them.</p> <p>Please let me know your views regarding that.</p> <p>Thank you</p> <p>Buddy Owensâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
