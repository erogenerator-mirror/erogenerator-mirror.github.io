At the rear is a door into the hall, at the left a door leads to an adjoining</strong> kitchen. In the room, a woman is already standing at the bar pouring out glasses. She is a pretty petite blonde, maybe a tiny bit shorter than me, probably a little shorter than the receptionist, with her head down and her hands resting on the bar.</p> <p>"So you were wondering why I invited you here this afternoon?" I ask, as I enter the kitchen.</p> <p>She looks up at me and smiles. "Mmm, I thought you would've joined us already. I'm glad you called me." We sip our drinks, her eyes on me as we do so. I walk over to her and begin to unbutton her shirt. "Let's get you out of those clothes then," I say as I remove my shirt. She stands patiently, her hands still on the bar, while I take her glasses and throw them on the counter. I pull her shirt off over her head and toss it on top of her clothing. She smiles as her shirt is tossed away. I unsnap her bra, and her young breasts swing free, her nipples erect and ready to spill milk. She places her glass on the counter, moves to stand in front of me, and takes my head in hands and kisses me, her breasts sliding on my chest. Without prompting, she slides her lips down, her tongue darting in and out of my mouth. Now she stands naked before me, her hands on her hips. She stands slowly, rubbing her hands over my shoulders and down my arms. When she stops kissing me she stands for a moment, smiling.</p> <p>"I want to do many things with you," she says. "But first I need to taste you, so you can feel me." Without waiting for an answer she kneels in front of me, reaches out and takes my dick in her hand, then slowly brings it to her mouth.</p> <p>A drop of pre-cum covers the head, and I arch my groin forward just a fraction, forcing it into her mouth. I feel her tongue move around it, licking at it as she moves it up and down. I'm in heaven, I think, with my dick in this dark-haired beautiful lady's mouth, and the taste of her pussy on it. I'm not about to stop her, I think, so I bring my hands down to her firm ass and pull her towards me. Just as I do this I feel her tongue licking a trail up the bottom of my shaft, across the head and around the head, then along the ridge of my head. She does this a few times, teasing me with her tongue, and then takes the head in her mouth again. She moves her head up and down, sliding my cock in and out of her mouth. Her tongue comes in contact with the ridge of my head, as if she is exploring a new flavor she hasn't tasted before. My hips press forward, causing my dick to move deeper into her mouth. She continues this a few more time, and then pulls off me. She stands back, licks her lips, and smiles at me again.</p> <p>"I enjoyed sucking your dick while I did," she says. "Don't you want to fuck me?"</p> <p>Again I reply, somewhat weakly. "Yes, but that is forbidden."</p> <p>"I want it now! Can you fuck me, with my legs spread wide?"</p> <p>I pull her to sit on the edge of the kitchen table, face down, her arms behind her. I kneel in between her legs and take her by her ankles and hold her open. She spreads her legs, inviting me to enter her. She leans back on the table, her eyes closed, her hands tied behind her, her breasts thrust out.</p> <p>I move forward between her legs and put my cock in her pussy. I take my time, slowly, enjoying this first view of a woman's pussy wrapped around my dick, enjoying my first time making love to another woman. I know my cock fills her, I know I am in her pussy. But there is no hurry about this; I don't want to hurt her this early in this love-making session, I just want this moment to last.</p> <p>I enter her, slowly, my body pushing into hers. I feel her legs wrap around me. I'm fucking her with slow, long strokes, as my hands slide over her ass. I pull her legs up and apart, her knees wide apart, exposing her pussy to the sun. She lets out a deep sigh as I rub my hands over her thighs, her ass, her breasts. I pull my cock from her pussy and insert it back into her mouth, where her tongue cleans my dick.</p> <p>I start off slowly stroking my dick in and pulling slowly, but building momentum. I'm going in closer and closer to her pussy. On the lips. I feel warmth. She closes her hand on the base of my belly I take my dick with each stroke—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
