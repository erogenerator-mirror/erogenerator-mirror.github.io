Even the best-fucked world is imperfect. I only know that we were from outer space to the darkest reaches of time. The only thing that's better in my world than the world I can think of, is that one doesn't have to have the world that way. All good guys, but to be honest, I'd prefer to go where the dark places are."</p> <p>"You know that I'm not an enemy of yours. I want to do what is right."</p> <p>Candide shrugged his broad shoulders. "We didn't give us much time to think up anything else. When you've made your choice," Candide said, giving her one more long lick of cunniiirice, "you're right."</p> <p>"What can you do?" Candide said, giving Candide one last kiss for leaving it long enough to make her do the same. "But I guess that is enough foreplay. Now we can start something of our own." Candide grabbed a big, fat, black rubber cock which was ready to be used as a cock strap. Looking up, he motioned for Candide to come closer. "You want a good old fashioned assfucking?"</p> <p>"That's better than anything I've tried." Candide said, as he pushed her backwards so that she was propped up on one arm.</p> <p>"What'll I have to do about that?" Candide said, getting a little surprised at the thought. Crawling around behind Candide, the large, black stud knelt by her body, taking her by her tight-lipped ass crack. "I know you've been saving this up for a long time. It's not as good as yours," Candide chuckled. Bending her knees further up, Candide started thrusting both hands in front of her body, grabbing and rubbing her big, black ass cheeks, kneading them, and pulling them apart. Meanwhile, she held one of the black studs' hands, pushing it down and opening her anus with the head of her dildo. "I'm about to put my cock..." Candide said, pulling her other hand to her lips and getting it wet. She then guided the long, hard and huge end to her own anus. "Ahhhhh--I'm going to...uhhhhhhhh..." she said in a low, girlish voice.</p> <p>"Hey babe..." Candide said, taking the end of the dildo and pushing it through the hole between Candide's ass and thighs. She held onto Candide's hips as the black stud drove his cock into Candide's ass. "Mmmmmmmm," Candide moaned again to the sudden and massive penetration. "That's what they call ass-fucking! God, that feels good! It's soooo gooodddddd!" Candide moaned while slowly pulling her dildo out of the black stud's ass. "Uhhhh--damnnnnnnnnn!" she screamed as Candide quickly pushed the dildo fully back into her buttock. "Fuck me! Fuck me!" Candide moaned. "Fuck my ass! I need to be fucked!"</p> <p>As if reading Candide's mind, the large black stud took a hold of Candide's shoulders. "You'll regret it if you don't fuck your ass," he said, giving her a little spank. "Not a soul in this world is the same as your ass. It's not like we've ever got any more holes to fill before," he added, as he resumed thrusting his dildo back into Candide's ass.</p> <p>"I bet you haven't fucked a buttplug in you, have you?" Candide asked, taking hold of the head and shaft of the big cock. "I can't wait to try," she said, pulling Candide's hands back up and placing them on the headboard of the bed. Once she had Candide's arms, she lowered her hands, forcing her own body back down the bed so that they were almost perpendicular to the bed edge. "Hands down here, babe," Candide said, bringing her own hands back, "and move them to your tits."</p> <p>As Candide lowered herself onto the bed, her breasts rubbed lightly across the hard ebony dick that was slowly, teasingly, sliding in and out between her cleavage. Candide could have let that happen all day long, but for her part, she felt that she was too close to the edge. She needed to cum and was so close, that it felt as if a whole lot more would happen in just a minute. She didn't want to get her whole body turned on, but just as fast. As much as she needed to cum as much, she did to cum as much as needed to cum, cum as much as much as could. If she could, she needed as needed in fact itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
