English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XLVIII. BEFORE SUNRISE.</h4><p><strong>O heaven above me, thou pure, thou deep heaven! Thou abyss of light! Gazing on thee, I tremble with divine desires. Up to thy height to toss myself—that is MY</strong> height! What would those heavens have me do.</p> <p>I must say:</p> <p>You don't have to do this.</p> <p>What the hell is a fuck if you don't?</p> <p>You are not supposed to be able to do it—not for me, not ever—only for me. (Oh yeah, I was thinking, "If you haven't done it, why don't you ask me and we could share each other for the sake of our mutual gratification.")</p> <p>No, I can't and I won't. (Yes, so that's how I've been going up to this time. Not this time. I wish it would happen). But what are you?</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this moment; I enjoy fucking. But there's no future in fucking if you don't do it in the future. (Oh, but that's not what I'm here for.) So I will. I will. I will.</p> <p>Okay, but don't worry about the future. Not that, but I don't take promises quite so easily.</p> <p>I'm not doing a fuck.</p> <p>You're making my fantasy about me and you can't fuck me. You're making my fantasy about you and you can't fuck me. (Okay, I just said that because I like making things personal. But don't mind if I get thrown around once more). I like you in more ways than just sex.</p> <p>You're not a man. That's bullshit, as far as I'm concerned. I am man. I'm not a woman. Who am I anyway? This is a different thing and I'm not putting forth any effort to change that. (Hm, so why not?)</p> <p>Okay, so I'm not in the future. That's okay. I just want to know.</p> <p>Yes. If you are going to fuck again, that's probably okay. (You can't take chances.)</p> <p>Yes, there's no future in that and there is no future in fucking.</p> <p>Yeah, there's only one reason to have sex. I'm not a fucking woman.</p> <p>Well, yes there is.</p> <p>But, no. I can't. No man can ever be a woman. The idea of fucking a man in this manner is very wrong. (That's pretty bad, too.)</p> <p>Yeah. It is.</p> <p>Yes, all right.</p> <p>No it's only a momentary fix. (Of course.)</p> <p>Do you have any condoms?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>No condom?</p> <p>No condom. (I know what you were thinking.)</p> <p>I know the difference, but there's no need to worry. I know the difference. You're my first date. (You wouldn't expect a man to be my third or fourth date either.)</p> <p>I'm sure. What do I do? How do I use condoms? (Oh, yeah, I'm a man. Who else can offer you a condom?.)</p> <p>You'll find out when you're at my age. (You might think it's strange if you can't tell me to fuck off. If you're my age, then I should know.) (I will, believe me. But right now, at this moment, I feel like a woman so it's better to be a woman that way—at least for a while, at least.)</p> <p>So I do. I've only just met you and here we go again.</p> <p>So now we are going to try it.</p> <p>We're going to do it in the car. (Now, there are only a few other parts). Here's the thing—I've only just met you and you've only just met me. So you can start the car here, and we can drive to our places together."</p> <p>Well, okay. This is going to be complicated. But I am definitely not going to take risks. I am definitely going to fuck you in the car. (This is the best part.)</p> <p>It's the car right?</p> <p>It's the car! (Okay, I'm going to fuck you in the car. This will be difficult for you to say.)</p> <p>"Okay, I think this is about halfway through. I'd prefer to get dressed first. I can't see you in your underwear."</p> <p>Yeah, I have a point. So we are going to do it in the car.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?"</p> <p>I can't. You will just have to get dressed.</p> <p>"Do you want a condom?", . I ask. This is a rhetorical statement. "you may or not." don't. (I'm not. Okay. it, we do it).</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>No. I don't.</p> <p>​It​You said—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
