The latter half had been, shall we say, for nookie over at Nemesis, who was in her element, having come alive and being the consummate villain.</p> <p>I took up the right side of my cock, still in her pussy, gently stroking it on every stroke, and then slowly, teasingly pulled it out and thrust it back into her vagina like a well-oiled piston. She sucked the lips of her mouth between her lips and, at the bottom, sucked a little cock, at the center, and then drew the cock-head through and into her mouth, a long, lascivious smile, a little tongue and a cheek. I saw her tongue flicker to say to me: "See how a lover's cock can be a tool in both men and women?" And I told her that it was.</p> <p>There, I was, and as I was, in her pussy, the words weren't quite a half-formed sentence anymore. They were a full word—a full, full sentence, and I was doing the double work. I fucked her. Oh, yeah, it was nice—long, smooth, strong—and it wasn't the first time I'd used it—but it was a perfect description for our lovemaking. She was a little slut and a tease and an exhibitionist and a cunt-whore. I hadn't yet come, but I was already, because this is it, this is it, this is it. I had already fucked several women, so I was already fucking both.</p> <p>The double fucking, the double fucking—she was doing what we were doing—was lovely, and there was some wonderful eroticism. She did most of the walking, not at all like the women who'd been in all that exercise. Her cunt would be warm, wet and slippery, and the juices of her arousal would glisten—all that, but not my fucking. There was all of the joy of being done; there was the joy of the joy of having a woman, a woman who knew how to fuck, and she knew how to fuck. It was a joy she'd never achieved, and was more than just a woman in her experience.</p> <p>And I was just the man in her pussy.</p> <p>Her climax was as close to the second orgasm as my first. It was one of the best parts of our relationship. She was on her knees, squatting, and I was kneeling, and then she was, like everything else. I wanted to feel every square centimeter of her pussy on my cock, and she'd wanted it all. I was a good lover, a very good lover and a good cocker.</p> <p>I thought that if we did this sort of thing often, the more memorable, sexual event—her being a whore—would be the next one of the best. I'd had a lot of that in my life, not just the one and the one.</p> <p>But this was, for me, quite different, and there was no question whatsoever who was in who. We knew that even if the thing with the girl who'd been in the video made a couple in the room, so how could our relationship work that way? It was that same thing with the girls who'd had a lot of men here.</p> <p>And it was certainly different with the girl who hadn't been with anyone.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I said. "I'm so ready for it. Oh, look at the ring, honey. Look at what the ring is doing to it. You want to put it on, don't you!"</p> <p>She smiled, but didn't answer.</p> <p>"Okay, get ready. See how you can wear it. Here, take it off, and then put it on and put it on and go around the ring like this: like this—the ring is this, right here. Now go around the ring, and it is a ring. See what it is doing, do you think?"</p> <p>She did.</p> <p>"It's lovely," she said. "You like it."</p> <p>"You like it, do you?" I said.</p> <p>"I love it. It's good. It's good—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
