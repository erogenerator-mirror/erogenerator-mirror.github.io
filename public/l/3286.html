English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter IX. The Preachers of Death.</h4><p><strong>This is an analysis of the psychology of all those who have the “evil eye” and are pessimists by virtue of their constitutions.</strong></p> <p>I want to say how much you should read it in order so I can understand it all better.
