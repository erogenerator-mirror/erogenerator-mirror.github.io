As he that is bitten by a mad dog, is afraid of everything almost</h4><p><strong>that he seeth: so unto him, whom the dogmata have once bitten, or in whom true knowledge hath made an impression, everything almost that he sees or reads be it</strong> not, what he doesn't just doesn't really mean what he thinks and what he never sees. And to fuck, we call it. we call it. I think, I don't have any choice but to fuck you. So do ye wish it, or not?"</p> <p>I think for once that this was a good thing that would happen with each encounter.</p> <p>"Do ye really want to do that?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do," he said. "I want to do it. To fuck you."</p> <p>I was still uncertain of my feelings with this, but at least my thoughts of him were rational in his state.</p> <p>"Will ye let it happen?"</p> <p>"God, ye know me well," he said, "do I get to fuck you so that I can tell you how?"</p> <p>"Then let's do it. I've been thinking about doing this ever since we started to kiss."</p> <p>"Oh, fuck it," I said, but he hadn't moved off of the sofa, had taken hold of his shirt, unfastened it and let it drop to the floor. He was naked. His cock is huge and hard.</p> <p>I said "No, I don't want to do it. Let's do it from the bed."</p> <p>"I don't want to go to the bedroom. I want to do it here, on the grass, like the others. In the woods. It feels great to do it with a guy you haven't seen yet. Let's do it here, if I can keep from getting aroused by it. But I cannot let you go to the bedroom."</p> <p>"What about the others? Are they okay? Have I got the right guy to satisfy my curiosity?"</p> <p>"Let's do it by the bed."</p> <p>So we walked to the bed. As we sat next to each other, I unbuttoned his shirt and pushed it off his shoulders with my foot. I pushed his body back against the bed-covers, my hands on his chest, one hand on his waist, running fingers up and down the crack of his armpits, stroking his sides and his nipples through the thin fabric of his shirt. I unzipped his trousers and felt that he was not wearing underwear. He lifted my shirt to release that and I pulled him to me and we embraced.</p> <p>Suddenly he raised himself off the bed and turned me on my back on the bed. He was already stripped to the waist, and his cock was at its full size. I sat up on my elbows to see it fully erect and pointed. He lifted me on to the bed with one hand and then climbed on me. He pushed my legs out so as to position his cock inside me just a millimetre away from the mouth of my pussy. I grabbed his butt like he wanted and held for him. He was now inside. He was in, he was completely, I was holding his cock inside me and he was fucking me with everything he had inside me.</p> <p>I think that it surprised him. He began moving, he was fucking me with me. He was moving my whole body with his: one hand on my waist, one on my back. He was now fucking me in the pussy with my legs still together, but he was moving with me. He was really moving himself into and out of me, not in a steady rhythm, but in a steady manner. He was really fucking me. We were both completely in the moment: he was fucking me with all of his might and I was holding his butt and fucking him with my arms. In less than a minute he was going as fully in me as he could, and with a final movement in my pussy, I was ready to come as well, and he was ready for that, he couldn't hold back any longer. I felt his cock swell, then it was as far as it could go with me still holding his butt. Then he pulled out. He rose out of me as I stood on my knees and looked at his cock for a second.</p> <p>And then he was gone. He had only just come; no time to enjoy that sensation. He rolled off and went to the bathroom. I was still lying there on the bed, my heart beating in my chest, but I didn't feel the rush of him leaving. I had to wait. I lay there as he came back and sat down on the bed beside me. He took off his clothes and sat next to me. I was breathing just a little faster than I used to.</p> <p>"Did you enjoy me?" he said.</p> <p>"You are beautiful," I replied. "You are very good looking."</p> <p>"And you're very well built." I said. "I love that."</p> <p></p> <p>Then we got a few minutes later when the room came to ourselves into the dozed. He was fully clothed againâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
