When the trenches are farther apart, underground warfare is seldom employed. In</strong> my class, I learned that the trenches were almost all underground. My teacher used to ask me if there was something in the whole universe or the universe that made them go underground. It didn't matter. My world was under the sea, so it was like they couldn't survive underneath.</p> <p>In some wars, the trenches were far enough from the sea, but in some wars, the trenches were just about nowhere. Sometimes, there are several kinds of trenches. In some of the trenches, the trench is at least 50 meters long, maybe even 100 meters, or so. It can be called a 'hay-high trench', but it is used to defend the planet's air in many parts of the world. In this particular war, the trench is about 200 meters long – 50 meters above ground level. This particular war is about 200 meters below ground level. I was in position for several seconds. I could see the trenches in the moon light around the trench near the coast of a distant planet. The trench was just inside the trench in the middle. I'm sure even if I could get another 100 meters up the trench, they wouldn't be visible even if it was an urban area.</p> <p>I heard footsteps in the trench in front of me while I was still in the trench. I was standing near the trench in a very small, well lit building. There was a large metal door in front of me; I noticed that it was slightly ajar. Someone stood nearby standing near the door on the first level and said something to someone behind him, the person replied a few words that made my heart skip a beat. The person looked toward me, then back to someone near me and said something else. I couldn't hear anything clearly; I couldn't see, but I could feel someone looking at me. The person in front of me spoke again, a brief, "Hello."</p> <p>Without saying a word, the person standing behind me smiled at me while turning toward the person in front of me. I could not feel quite who the person was, but for some unexplainable reason I suddenly felt his hand on the inside of my left thigh. I was standing in the trench with all the air around us at 90 meters above ground level, but it was a lot smaller. It felt cold on my flesh and a good distance between my legs. My skirt was a soft pinkish pink. I couldn't feel his hand and it was moving up further on my upper thigh, then his hand moved around my waist and my skirt moved upward, until it was resting in my pants. He touched my thigh again while pushing my pants up slightly. The person behind me continued to speak another few words to somebody on the outside of the trench, then the person in front of me spoke a few more words and walked away.</p> <p>I was standing on a small, metal door with no windows. There was an area about 90 meters below the floor and I could feel another person standing at the window directly next to me. While I was still there, his hand reached my thigh and my skirt rose further up. My body became exposed. His hands reached my panties first. I didn't know what to do but I opened up my legs slightly, so he could move closer to my body. I realized that his hands were now very close to my crotch, but I had to keep pushing against the floor to get closer to him. My panties were very wet and I felt that my panties were very wet and soaking very quickly. I felt a very strange hand rubbing my panties and the hand was moving back down, then forward, then down again. He reached further down and I felt his fingers touch my waistline. I spread my legs wider.</p> <p>The hands moved back to my panties and started rubbing my panties. My panties were wet and I could feel them getting soaked on my crotch and thighs. I knew I was wet down there too. The person behind me touched my crotch again. "I can see your wetness. I can feel your juices!" He said "I can get a much better view." Then his fingers stopped touching my panties.</p> <p>I couldn't even see my face from my position in the trench. He removed his hand from my crotch and turned around. He was standing right at my waist. I didn't know which way I should move but I couldn't choose anything so I moved one foot forward. My dress was now bunched on my waist and I was standing there with my body facing directly forward with my legs straight. I moved my legs apart again. My dress was bunched up my waist so that my skirt had risen above my waist.</p> <p>I felt his hot breath on my bare crotch and it made me shiver and goose bumps. He stopped moving my legs apart. He then and held my hips firmly. He touched my crotch again the side of my panties. I could feel the outline of my whole of my lips. His hand. He touched my crotch.
