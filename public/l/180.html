The Prophet.</h4><p><strong>“Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?” Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the water, for the moment each occupied with his own</strong> thoughts.</p> <p>“So what do you think, Seh?” Seh asked after the exchange of his own thoughts. Seh’s dark hair floated along with the water. “You’re the best-looking one of the crew there in all that time, huh?”</p> <p>“Oh, Seh!” I said, turning back to him. “You’ll make the best crew that you got.”</p> <p>“What?” Seh asked, as the water began to clear out his ears.</p> <p>I sat down next to Seh, and put my arm around his shoulders. He leaned back against me and held my hand. “Seh, do we look to serious?”</p> <p>“What do you mean by serious?”</p> <p>“That man who can’t seem to get enough of you, Seh?” I asked, rubbing the back of my hand up and down. I could feel Seh’s cock hardening under my hand. “What do you think?” I asked, rubbing my hands up under Seh’s shirt. I could feel he was very uncomfortable with me touching him, as his chest heaved and moved.</p> <p>Seh smiled, and leaned forward so that we were nose-to-nose, and just stared at each other. “I guess it makes sense,” Seh said, smiling and looking into my eyes as I stroked his muscular arms. Seh was only too happy to let me stroke his chest, as his nipples hardened. “Heh, you’re a hottie!”</p> <p>Suckling at Seh, I kissed his shoulder then the base of his neck. Seh’s cock and my hands on his ass felt like they were made from marble. “Seh, we shouldn’t,” I said, holding my hands to his crotch and massaging him. “My, what’s this?”</p> <p>“Seh, come here,” he said, as he stood from the water. His dick stood stiff and proud. “Come on, lover,” he said. “Touch me.”</p> <p>Lying beside Seh, I spread Seh’s legs with my knees. Seh raised his knees to get into a wider stance when I lay on him, sitting up so we were just as close. His legs were soft and warm, and felt very sexy against the softness of my hands. Seh’s breathing became shorter, and the warmth in his body began to radiate, so I reached up and played with his nipples. When Seh moaned softly, I squeezed his balls gently. “That’s it, kiss me,” I said. We were both breathing hard, and our hearts were beating as loud as can be. “You feel good,” Seh said.</p> <p>“It feels great just the way you feel!”</p> <p>Our kisses began longer and with more urgency. Seh felt my nipples harden, and I could feel his cock twitch when we touched.</p> <p>“Let’s do some fucking!” Seh exclaimed when we broke our kiss. His stiff prick stood straight up, pointing at a perfect vertical angle.</p> <p>Hunching over Seh, I straddled him, feeling his erection inside of me, and sat down, letting him sink deeper into the wet heat and warmth of my pussy. “Wow!” Seh exclaimed, as he spread my legs further apart with his arms. I felt his prick sliding inside of me, pressing against my G-spot. God, he was good. After that first contact, Seh took full control of me, and let me have my own way. We rocked the boat, fucking up and down, while Seh reached up to fondle my tits. I came very quickly, cumming twice more. Seh came once even more, and my body responded as hard as iron.</p> <p>When Seh felt me starting to relax, he rolled me over, and got up. “I want more,” I said.</p> <p>“Well, I can guarantee you,” he said. “You’re never gonna have your fill of me again.”</p> <p>“We never have anything going on.”</p> <p>“No more than I have my own to have, Seh. I want to be more with you, but only we can get more of each other.”</p> <p>.”</p> <p>”</p> <p></p> <p>we said and he said, and kissed again. “and he kissed. and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
