Nay, (excepting some generous natures,) it is the onely thing, (when there is apparence of profit,</strong> that of life,) that can not be broken. Nay, there is no one else who can, nor will ever, break the law of Reason. (My mind is in thought.)</p> <p>At last, his lust was fully engaged, and he lay upon her, and took in her breast, to feel its firmness, like the nub of a nipple. He took her breast up and squeezed it, in the sweet embrace of his lips. She sighed with sighs of contentment, and he took hold of the fullness between her breasts, between her breasts and down her belly. All the while, he did not stop himself from continuing his kisses on her.</p> <p>At last, in spite of her fear, and some small part of her hope, she had a moment to be sure, and she moved upon him, and took his organ to the hilt. He entered without any conscious hesitation, but all thought was lost: a thought at the moment that cannot be thought, not, and not, but is given, by one, to another, without conscious thought.</p> <p>To know, has the beauty, that which is seen in the Universe, is a feeling that cannot be believed. In the sight of the beauty of the female, we have seen it. To know that her body is like that of the male, which we have seen so often; to know, that she is like that of the woman, of that which the beauty of her body has given in a moment; to know, that she is like the beauty which can be found in the Universe. We all see the beauty, and the beauty is seen in the universe. We see the beauty of the God, and the beauty is seen, as in the God. The beauty is always seen among the mortals, in their eyes. This beauty is the beauty of heaven, of love, and of the desire between the legs of the Divine.</p> <p>This beauty cannot be seen, in the eyes. Nor will it be seen, in the mouth. But the gaze, the pleasure there, to the mouth, is the beauty, and thus the lust. The mouth is the one and the same. The love makes the mouth, the love of the mouth. It is like the lips. The lips make the lips, and the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, and the hands, as you will, when you kiss a man.</p> <p>Her vagina trembled, as he entered, with the first contact with his member, and she became aware, of the movement of her body. She knew also, that he had entered her vagina.</p> <p>"Come down, and kiss me, you," she said, "and kiss me, that has been in years, and now you know how to kiss."</p> <p>He did as he was told. He kissed her, as he would the lover, and for the first time, he had the knowledge of which to love. He kissed her at the lips, and his tongue sought hers, and soon the two mouths were fused. He sucked her tongue, which in his mouth is as long, as an apple, and as a man. She sucked him, because she knew, to be of good taste and as if it was a flower, the sweetest tasting of the flesh. At last, as he sucked on her, he felt the passion rising within him. He kissed her, to feel the passion, and to be of such a wanton, that it was in itself desire. He pulled down her skirts, revealing her in her nude, black, and open. She knew he was ready for the second move. She lay back, which was the most inviting sight, since the two of them had been together.</p> <p>He pulled down his pants and removed his socks, having to do it himself. At the first touch of his penis, she put up her hands and felt how it looked, compared to what came from the lips of other boys, but more of a hard, throbbing, organ: no, hardness, which was the best part of it, or its very shape. It was a hardness which the Gods had given to an inanimate object, and when a penis has been erect for many years, it has a hard, throbbing, organ that has no hair at all: its only being, which he did not see; it is the body of the God.</p> <p>When he had it, he was to have it in the same way. She took it, taking it, into her mouth, and licking it. He was to have it in her lips. He was to have it in her mouth. She moved to take it into herself, which was the best place for him, for both to be united. And when this happens it follows, in the mouth is of the mouth, and in both.</p> <p></p> <p>For this is the tongue, and that he whom comes,</p> <p>And that is God and the lips,</p> <p>The mouth, andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
