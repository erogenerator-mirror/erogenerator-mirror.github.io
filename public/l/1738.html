THE GRAND HALL.</h4><p><strong>Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the</strong> sound of the Cathedral and the sound of traffic on the street and in the town, the sound of the rain drum and the sound of the birds singing their favourite song over and over, the sound of the buses on the streets and even the sound of the train at O'Daybreak; as a sign of life. They woke up for their first day in Paris.</p> <p>It was a warm day. It had gone well and the city was bustling and the streets were still bustling with people. The city was busy and the busyness was beautiful which meant that it was a perfect time to have a bit of fun.</p> <p>Livy stood beside Livy and they kissed. He kissed her and they shared a quick hug. And then he kissed her again, he felt her tongue against her lips and they had exchanged tongues in their mouths, his tongue, he felt his cock pressed against her leg, the tip of it nudging her leg, that was perfect, she was delicious, this wasn't a dream.</p> <p>He felt Livy's hands on his back, on his back. The light of the moon was still shining on them but they could just make out the shapes of one another's body as they kissed, all shapes from a distance. He felt Livy's hand at the small of his back again, she could feel the muscle in his arms as she squeezed him, and his hand slid across her back, feeling her breasts, he felt Livy's breasts, there was no denying the fact that this moment of intimacy was real, a sexual moment.</p> <p>It was a dream for Livy, she was dreaming, but as he squeezed her body closer to his he could feel her breasts pressing against his chest, he could feel his cock inching up her leg and his cock pressed against her stomach; he could feel the moistness of her pussy under his cock. He could feel the heat of Livy's pussy against his cock.</p> <p>He felt like he needed to say something, to make her happy but he had to be honest with himself.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how we're going to finish this," he said, "but..."</p> <p>Livy's eyes caught of his words.</p> <p>"No it's not that, not really, but then what's the good of me fucking you if we're finished? Oh, I'd love that," she said, and the sound that came from Livy, the sound that he had just made because of his words, the sound as if Livy was actually saying it for the first time and as if she was saying it because she had to.</p> <p>"Well let's finish then," a voice from the window said, "it's time, you have no control."</p> <p>Livy got off of her bed and he kissed her again, her breasts were full and he kissed her nipples again, then he kissed her breasts again.</p> <p>"Oh, Livy," he said, his cock pressed against her leg, and, still kissing her, his hand slid into Livy's panties and a finger slid across her pussy, Livy gasped and moaned.</p> <p>"Mmm, you're wet," he said, and then kissed her again. He pulled away from her kissing her, he kissed her again, he kissed her, Livy looked up at him, "are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes," was all that he said.</p> <p>She felt his cock pressing hard again against her leg and then she felt his cock at the entrance to her pussy, she felt the warmth of his body, the hardness, the heat, she could only imagine how long he'd be there, how long it would be until he was ready to go again.</p> <p>She felt a rush of joy as she felt the hardness of him in her body, it was wonderful, the heat of him was incredible, what a wonderful feeling.</p> <p>He was on his back and Livy climbed on top of him, his cock slipped deep into her. The feeling of his cock against her body was incredible. She began to rock on him, she felt such a wonderful feeling, her body was aching for that pressure, needed that pressure.</p> <p>She felt him slide deep inside her and knew it was time.</p> <p>"Let's do this," Livy said softly, and then she was going to fuck him.</p> <p>It was the very first time she'd made love to a man and it was the first time she had made love to him to whom she was sure he had no idea.</p> <p>Her heart was pounding hard in her chest and she couldn't hold back anymore. All of a sudden she had a vision in her mind of that a man and she was having sex, she was a man, and she, they both, both, both, in bed side by side by side, a man and man and woman, two people. A she was that could be and bothâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
