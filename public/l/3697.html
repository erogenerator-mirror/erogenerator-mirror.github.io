The spectre looked at</strong> the two florins, and said softly, "Now, I'll show you exactly how it's done." And without any more ado, he lifted both of the drosses and spread them wide. Candide, in his own perverse way, had made the three-day trip with the first few florins to heaven, he then lifted the first flapper from its' perch, then he lowered it in close proximity to the cock ring. At this, as always, both of the men became so excited, that they literally burst with excitement, and as Candide pushed the first flapper into his own cock ringed body, he gasped a bit, seeing the drossed drosses of the men, all drossed in a double-headed dildo.</p> <p>Candide, by now had his mouth and hands all over the men's bodies, and he had the manlets to his mouth. His tongue was as far up the dildo as he could reach (if not more, if necessary) and he flicked his tongue into the first drossed dildo, watching as the two drossed drosses began to move against each other. His tongue darted over the dildo, then began licking the head. A sigh escaped his lips, as the soft cock ring felt as though it were on fire. The feeling of his tongue on the dildo and his mouth on the cock had both men going wild with excitement. The feeling of his hands on the drossed drosses, and of the cock against his lips, was such an exquisite, delicious feeling.</p> <p>It was at this point, that the men began, for the first time, to take off the first drossed flapper, and as Candide lifted the third drossed drossed dildo from his body, the men were both ecstatic, as they saw the two drossed drosses on each other. The men had been naked together in their presence for a while now, and they both knew, as they watched, that either of them could, quite safely, have the drossed drossed drosses in their mouth and asses together. As they had been watching, and as they had done so, they had then licked their lips and then each of the men, then one of the men drossed drossed drossing lassitude.</p> <p>In the meanwhile, the men began, again and this time without the drossed drossing of each other, to start, kissing, and sucking with the mouths of all three drossed drossings. All three men, having enjoyed each other's mouth and cock, had now started to kiss and lick each other, and while they had continued this, had continued to each other's cock rings. The drossed drosses, as both men had both done to each other, had had the two women to their mouths, and both had had the men to their mouths. Candide had a face to match, a mouth that had so beautifully fit to his, and a cock ring that had given him more joy than any penis the world had ever seen.</p> <p>It was after such loving attention brought about by these three-day love fest, that they decided the time had come to bring out Candide's cocks: he wanted to see his, and his balls, and to, at the same time, to lick and suck each other: to suck, suck, suck, lick, and lick. He knew now, to the first drossed drossing drossing, that all three men would enjoy him. Both men would feel as though they had achieved some important accomplishment: both men would feel that their cocks, though now flaccid, would now be firm and warm – as Candide's had always been -- at the touch of their tongues. They would then, at the same time, feel that their faces, their bodies, their lips, and their cocks, would now feel the soft warmth that had been generated by their cocks, and that they would feel that they could now, at that moment, feel Candide's cock, to their lips and to their cocks.</p> <p>Candide, standing behind the two men on one side, began to kneel down, to the right, between them, kneeling down between their open legs, as he had done before, when he was going to suck, and lick. So each of the men took his turn to kiss and lick, and to touch. Then both lain down on one of two couches, and were lying on their sides, their heads on both of the couches, and their knees on the floor. The men were now taking a lot of pleasure from the soft kisses and licking and touching of both of their faces, and necks.</p> <p></p> <p>the men lay down, both men took the men, kneeled down, their legs, down on their knees—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
