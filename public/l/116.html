The Night Shadows</h4><p><strong>A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great</strong> city, the city is your home, my friend.</p> <p>That is so very romantic.</p> <p>It is time to embark upon my journey and take the time to savor my new world as it is made.</p> <p>When I returned home, I knew all my worldly things came to life.

And my heart ached to embrace life where we were always, always, always, always.</p> <p>It was time, for me, to embrace life to its fullest and all the better.</p> <p>I returned to my life and my new home. I had no real place to live. I could not do it or even want to. All I wanted for the rest of my life was to be with some woman and to love her.

The days where no one knew anything beyond our first names.</p> <p>When my husband left, I had nothing left anymore, I lost the life I had built over five years. All my hopes, dreams, plans, all came to a crashing halt when he moved away from my heart. I was alone. I just stood there, lost, aloneâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
