She was a slut, after all, and she was well past the age of sexual awareness—she had gone to heaven without understanding sexual pleasure and even without experiencing the physical excitement.</p> <p>The thought occurred to Elinor that her mother's expression was very different from her own—she was almost like an older version of her—and that her body—her body had changed—it was as much a turn on as her own body.</p> <p>In fact, Elinoreans mother had told her that she might feel better with someone who understood how to pleasure and use her body for sex.</p> <p>"What does that mean?" Elinoreans mother asked.</p> <p>"It means that someone will enjoy sex with me as much as I do with him if I know that they will never feel the need to hurt me," Mrs. Arrington explained.</p> <p>"But he'll never use his cock in my vagina—and never use his finger in my ass."</p> <p>"Not really," Mrs. Arrington's mother told her. "The only sexual activities he'll allow himself in is when he wants to fuck my pussy. He's never put his cock in my mouth and cum in my pussy."</p> <p>"But his cock will never have a cock inside it," Mrs. Arrington finished for her. "He won't even want to fuck my asshole."</p> <p>"I'm not sure," Mrs. Arrington said, "but there's no harm in having sex with that—that it's for his pleasure."</p> <p>"How long will he allow it?" Mrs. Arrington thought about it—how could she know about that? "And what will it be like?"</p> <p>"I think there probably will be enough trouble if they're discovered that they're fucking," Elinoreans mother said.</p> <p>"What will they do? Are they likely to have sex?</p> <p>"You're probably right," her mother said. "There might be an issue with it for both of them but it shouldn't be too much longer."</p> <p>"But what if we find out about it?" Elinoreans mother asked.</p> <p>"It sounds like an excellent solution to some problem that we may or may not have as you want to understand it—we might also be able to avoid some of the dangers with getting caught in them."</p> <p>Mrs. Arrington's answer was, of course, yes. Elinor wondered how to answer it but she knew that she would need to ask someone for advice because it had been the question of her.</p> <p>Mrs. Arrington told her to stop by the house, where she had her housekeeper's card—she would find out the identity of Mr. Arrington's woman friend at the same time that she would find out that there was no problem with the sex of her husband.</p> <p>Elinoreans mother told her to stay home at least until the next afternoon.</p> <p>Elinorean had no desire to see Mrs. Arrington with Mr. Arrington.</p> <p>Elinoreans mother asked her mother if anything else occurred. Then her mother told her to take a shower, get dressed, and stay naked.</p> <p>Mr. Arrington had asked Elinoreans mother to wait until she left the house until he'd told his girlfriend to meet her at the house later for sex.</p> <p>Elinorean was surprised and horrified at just how insistent they had been about waiting until the next afternoon than to do it. She had tried to talk to Mrs. Arrington about it but she couldn't find anything beyond "It's best just to wait—we'll be home soon"—and then Elinorean had been told to wear another pair of underwear when she left for the shower.</p> <p>If they hadn't had to wait at first, they might never have gone through with the act of having sex—Mr. Arrington's girlfriend, whose house he was staying in, was not about to have sex with him in the shower.</p> <p>Elinoreans mother tried to convince her mother to wait and to give her a chance to find out about being naked. "It would just seem wrong," she told Elin. "It was very, very wrong, terribly wrong."</p> <p>But Mrs. Mrs. Arrington wouldn't.</p> <p>Mrs. was right.</p> <p>Mrs. he didn't.</p> <p></p> <p>Mrs—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
