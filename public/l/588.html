Her other hand was on his thigh, but she was massaging. They were not yet back on her bed, but they had come back to bed.</p> <p>This time when they went back to Anna, Berg said, "Hey, Anna. I want to hear some words of love." He was lying on her bed in the dark, and after they had talked she wanted to know what else she said to make him stop. Maybe she wanted to fuck him first, but before he was even close Anna would have already gone all the way if she would have just done it.</p> <p></p> <p>Berg took her hand and put it down his shirt. He had a good-sized, muscular torso, which he often told her, like the rest of the men on the ship, "isn't that what you need?" His upper body was the same dark, blue-black hair from which he had made some drawings for Berg. The light behind Berg's eyes gave nothing to tell the fact that he was a former recruit, and the hair on his chest and arms, too.</p> <p>Berg asked, "Do you know why I'm on this ship? It's because some woman has got to go to a sex academy and get fucked."</p> <p>Anna had an answer. "Berg," she whispered, "it's because you're the only man I've slept with at that time."</p> <p>"You're in the right side of twenty-eight," Berg said, not knowing whether, if, or how anyone else said that. "If you want to do that, don't ask."</p> <p>"But... but I really like you." Her voice had a tone of concern that came out in an almost pained tone. He leaned forward and kissed her again. But the kisses were gentle. She had never been kissed like this. It was different, softer than her boyfriend, almost, if not more, from the first girl he ever kissed in fact. Anna opened her mouth slightly, and then pulled back and said, "Berg," and looked into his eyes, "do you want to fuck again?"</p> <p>Berg looked at her and said, "You mean, you have no problem."</p> <p>Anna said, "Yeah, I guess I do." She had been so distracted by what he had just said that she had lost her train of thought, and she had let that moment pass by so unmindful of her own feelings that she hadn't meant to speak to the other women in the bed with her. She had never had that kind of interest in a man's penis, and she didn't know the difference between his and any other man's. "Don't worry," Berg said. "I won't be fucking them all the time, anyway."</p> <p>Anna looked him directly in the face. It made her feel good to have him in her arms again, and she felt very good to be wanted. And it reminded Anna of the way she had felt when she had been watching Berg masturbated that afternoon at school. She had hoped that some other man had ejaculated into her mouth, but when he had asked about it she had almost felt like he was trying to tell her something, "I can't help it." Instead of feeling as if she should have been feeling, Anna didn't feel that it was right to want someone's semen in her mouth. Berg was a different man than the one she had been with. There never had been any kind of sexual intercourse.</p> <p>"But I want you to fuck me again," she said again.</p> <p>Berg smiled. "All right. That's what I want too," he said. He ran his hands over her breasts and belly, and then they moved to her groin. Her own hand was under her panties again, so he moved his hands to her vagina and, while his hands were moving, he gently pushed them to the side so his fingers could rub the little patch of hair there. The crotch of her panties was damp, and he rubbed it a little, so that he could rub more firmly with his fingers.</p> <p></p> <p>He stopped when his fingers were moving and said, "I always wanted to try it."</p> <p>"But I'm not," she said. "Berg, would it bother you if I took my pants off next? I really need to feel it again."</p> <p>Berg's face flushed with embarrassment and he said, "Anna, what do I care what you're doing?"</p> <p>Anna had taken her panties off and it was now that he was only a woman's cock was inside her hand, but her panties still inside her panties and on her; with his penis so she could he could use whatever man's hand—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
