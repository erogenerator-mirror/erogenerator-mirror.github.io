To wipe away fancy, to use deliberation, to quench concupiscence, to</h4><p><strong>keep the mind free to herself.</strong> It was then that I had an idea. I would play it to the camera, use a program, and I would then have the chance to be my own little porn star. I would then have the chance to make the movies and I would be a successful Porn Star. This was my plan. As part of my job I had to plan, as I could not be caught in the act. I would try to do things that would not go too far, but I couldn't be caught in the act without my consent. Besides, what would the chances be of me turning it into a porn video? The chances of getting caught in a movie were nil. It was just too risky, so let it be a bit of a surprise. After all, I had to make sure it wasn't a porn video.</p> <p>Sure, this was part of my job. I would try to make it something that didn't feel forced. I could always have something special, which made it more interesting.</p> <p>There was also the possibility that I might not be good enough to be on camera.</p> <p>The reason why I made it this way was simple. I needed something special; someone who can take charge. I could make it easy on myself. I needed someone who would always obey and respect me.</p> <p>So, once my plan was formulated, I made all the necessary preparations.</p> <p>First, I took off every stitch I had on. First I had on a light, gauzy dress shirt that went to my knees. I wore a bra underneath. It didn't cover much, but it did allow me to show a bit more cleavage than before. Next I took off a pair of jeans that I was wearing. I took them off and made them seem to be for a night out; a night in which I would put on a sexy outfit to make a film. I put them off and gave them to my bedroom. I sat down on the bed and I took off my shoes, socks, and my under pants. I sat back, my legs spread apart a bit. My underwear was very light and I only had an extremely thin covering.</p> <p>Next I removed my bra. The bra I had was a fairly small piece of fabric, but I could still easily show cleavage and I would feel sexy underneath. Next, I put on some light, sexy panties that were very short. I took them off and put on a pair of black stockings under them. Next, I took a pair off and put them on, leaving everything to go on the bed. Before I put on a pair of black knee length boots, I wore a wig. I was glad those had not been included in my plan. I had to get dressed. I had to have a sexy costume.</p> <p>Next, I took off my wig. Then I put on a few layers. Then finally I took off my wig. It was such an expensive job that I had to have it just for myself. Only with this particular wig would I be wearing nothing else for a film.</p> <p>I felt like such an expensive Hollywood star.</p> <p>When that plan was laid out for me, I was going to make the decision about becoming my own porn star. I was going to be one.</p> <p>With that decided, I took off my dress shirt again and let it slide to the floor. I turned the lights so they were bright, making it seem more difficult and revealing. Then I took off my underwear and I gave myself a light and sexy, yet sexy, orgasm inducing climax with my bare pussy, which became fully visible to the camera.</p> <p>Next, I took off my panties.</p> <p>Now one of the hardest part of having a plan to start a porn movie was to be in a costume. The rest of the effort was going to be in trying to make me look as sexy as possible, which I had done already. And it was going to be difficult. I didn't want to think of myself as a sexy, sexy person. I wanted to look like the sexiest, sexiest girl in the world. This costume was all going to be for me.</p> <p>So, without further hesitation, once I was naked, I removed my panties as well. I got back onto the bed, sat there, and took off my shoes and socks, leaving them off. I put them in the chair and sat down. I took off my shoes and socks and took off my boots. I then took off my panties and put them in the chair.</p> <p>Now all I had on was my dress shirt. I sat that position all day, trying not to stare at my pussy while I sat there. I thought about what it would be like if I sat there was a camera, which camera was camera was going to make someone else look sexy in my pussy while he looked his face. I was not. I was on my pussy.
