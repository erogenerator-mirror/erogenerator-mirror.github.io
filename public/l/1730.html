There is little furniture—a long table strewn with manuscripts and papers, a desk. On the walls are revolutionary posters;</strong> a large desk with an imposing looking chair, a man in suit with a black shirt buttoned low enough to show his powerful, muscular torso, a short, dark-skinned and dark-eyed man, a small, well-manicured mustache resting on his chiseled jaw. The chair is also decorated with a painting of the city of Istanbul. The man and woman are sitting at the desks, waiting for someone to take them into his office to watch them go down on each other.</p> <p>The man has already taken off his tie and his shirt, revealing his strong shoulders, smooth black skin, and black and blue-gray hair. The woman's hair, he wears down as he often does and there's a short, narrow pony tail bobbing between his cheeks when her long dark hair is pulled from the ponytail. Both are smiling broadly.</p> <p>The man removes his white suit jacket and drops it on a nearby desk, then undoes his shoes and slacks. He's wearing a black silk shirt and black jeans. The woman doesn't speak, he doesn't need to, she is so friendly.</p> <p>The woman's a bit flushed and excited. She's no longer smiling and is breathing deeply. Her skirt has ridden up in back. She's also not wearing her underwear.</p> <p>"You must be really pretty," she says.</p> <p>The man takes the woman's bra and holds up the cups to reveal her rosy nipples. It's her bra.</p> <p>"We could be more careful," he says, taking the cups of her bra and lifting the bra up slightly. Then he runs his hand over one of her breasts, then the other.</p> <p>She looks down at him, her nipples rock-hard on her taut, flat chest.</p> <p>The man leans forward and takes one of her big breasts in his hand. He leans over the woman's breasts, kissing her cleavage, teasing her nipple.</p> <p>His mouth moves from one boob to the other. He takes a nipple in his lips and sucks it.</p> <p>"Don't you dare come!"</p> <p>The man removes his mouth and slides his tongue over the woman's nipple. The woman's mouth opens and her breathing is fast. Her nipples are so hard now that he can barely breathe, and her breasts are so swollen and big. It's like they're going to pop. The woman's moans are coming in time with his mouth. He gently bites her nipple.</p> <p>"Oh," the woman says, her fingers pressing her breast up toward her lips and moaning.</p> <p>The man then grabs her panties and slides them off her hips before pulling her body to him. The woman's legs are parted wide and her vagina is already beginning to grow. The man pulls her hips up so that her legs wrap around his waist, and the woman puts her arms around his neck. She feels his hot, muscular body against her, the heat coming off him, and her legs spread wider. The man takes her, plunging himself deep into her.</p> <p>He's fucking her. She feels a throbbing deep inside—her vagina responds to him by pulling him in to herself—and she puts her hands over his face and cries out when he begins a long and forceful fucking that takes very much longer the couple begins to orgasm together.</p> <p>The woman's pussy clamps down on the man as her orgasm courses through her. As she comes, her legs lock around the man's waist—she holds his hard cock deep inside her—and her hands grab a bit of his hair. He pulls her down harder as he feels her orgasm start to subside, and his own orgasm happens as he shoots his own cum deep into her with a grunt and a yell of pleasure.</p> <p>The woman releases her legs from both their grips and he collapses on top of her, still buried inside her.</p> <p>"You were a natural, you know," she says, looking up at him, her blue eyes glinting.</p> <p>"We really took things slow, didn't we? You were beautiful," he says, smiling down at her, rubbing gently against her belly. Her breasts are full and her nipples puffed up. She kisses his chest, his flat stomach, down to his cock. Her hands cup and massage his flaccid cock.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she says. "I knew there was a handsome guy around here." She kisses him on the lips, her tongue darting in and out his mouth, tasting its saltiness. She looks down at her hand on her son's flaccid cock, her fingers wrapped around him. "And I didn't want to rush into something so quick. And I mean this: I really have to know what I'm you to do to get you."</p> <p>"</p> <p>to go to go back!"</p> <p>"</p> <p>to you, she</p> <p>that time after to you, and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
