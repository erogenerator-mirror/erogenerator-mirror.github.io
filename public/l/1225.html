They were in the open air! The miasmas, darkness, horror lay behind him. The pure, healthful, living, joyous air that was</strong> his home. The world was alive, alive, in a vast and beautiful space. He began planting kisses down upon her neck and down upon her breasts and down to her belly. He continued down a path of butterfly kisses.</p> <p>All of a sudden her skin felt soft and warm against his. She moaned softly and squirmed underneath her, while he began kissing her neck and collarbone, and her breasts.</p> <p>When he reached out with his hands to find her nipples he saw they stood up at attention and he began suckling them.</p> <p>This was so much fun! He could not believe how erotic it was to be able to move this way.</p> <p>He moved his lips to her breasts and began kissing all along the way. This sensation was not unlike his own, but this woman knew that as he was about to begin exploring her body, she would feel the same sensations that he felt.</p> <p>He would need the energy to get his hands all over her. But for now he focused on her nipples again. He kissed all along it once again, and then slid his tongue into her breast, which produced an amazing sigh.</p> <p>He began kissing down her body again, and felt all of her skin heaving in anticipation. Finally his tongue arrived at the base where she waited for him. Her pussy was dripping wet, and he could imagine how he could make her feel in the midst of it.</p> <p>She was waiting for him, begging him for him, as she held onto his shoulders for balance. He was right. He gently pushed her thighs apart as he bent and began kissing her inner thighs.</p> <p>Once he began kissing her inner thighs he could feel her body squirm and tremble with excitement. He was glad, too, that he was not able to find her pussy.</p> <p>He placed his tongue on the wet lips and ran it along them, all the way from top to bottom.</p> <p>She was trembling with anticipation.</p> <p>Suddenly his lips were clamped upon hers and she felt his tongue licking inside her pussy. It was the first time that a man had really gone down on a woman. It felt good. It was wonderful. In fact, the woman was in the room, and enjoying herself!</p> <p>With some trepidation she realized that he was moving up her body and he was about to make himself come down upon her.</p> <p>"Oh, God! I'm going to come! Oh."</p> <p>She was about to feel him coming on her. She wanted to let him. "Come on, please. Fuck, yes. Yes! Yes! Yes!"</p> <p>After all that his mouth had just done to her she felt herself reaching orgasm and she began moaning loudly. She had never done anything like this before and she had never imagined it to happen to her.</p> <p>She felt him begin to move, as he had with her legs, and started fucking her with his cock. She had never been so filled with a man.</p> <p>This was so much better! She was making him come, too. His cock was so big, so strong that every other movement of his body was just that!</p> <p>After several orgasms she felt him starting to soften. He was on top of her and she wanted him in her. She was getting ready to reach climax, too.</p> <p>He pushed his cock back inside her and began thrusting again, as he kept eating her pussy. His whole body was moving in perfect harmony with hers.</p> <p>And then they both came in a simultaneous rush. She felt him start to come inside her. It was such bliss!</p> <p>As if coming together, they began kissing again but their mouths were far apart. He held tightly onto her and they kissed passionately as their bodies continued to shudder and shake.</p> <p>"Wow! That was really a long orgasm!"</p> <p>They were laughing now and were enjoying themselves. He was kissing the top of her neck, while she was kissing his face. She was surprised; she had never felt anything like this before, especially not with such a man!</p> <p>"Are you ready for something different now?"</p> <p>"Anything you want, lover, anytime you want, anywhere you want."</p> <p>"I'll bet. Take me in your arms, you big beautiful man!"</p> <p>She was still on top of him. Now she kissed him.</p> <p>"Are you ready?"</p> <p>"You've done so much!"</p> <p>He could think of nothing better, she had done more than enough to him. He pulled her to him. He could feel the passion in her. This was just sex! He was making her feel happy! This felt good!</p> <p>And he was surprised that she could feel her wanting to return the passion and he was the passion she had only for him! They were for her.
