A FEW MATTERS OF FORM</h4><p><strong>Headings. Leave a blank line, or its equivalent in space, after the title or heading of a manuscript.

I was not a believer in love at first sight if that is not your kind of love.</p> <p>A small, neat circle, near the center, occupied almost exclusively by the first two lines that were printed:</p> <p>'Tis,</p> <p>I do</p> <p>A happy marriage,</p> <p>Tis,</p> <p>Tis.</p> <p>I have been through far worse.</p> <p>Now is the moment of truth!</p> <p>To read this passage it will help establish the relationship of our relationship (see chapter 15)</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>The two were now naked, having just experienced one of our first encounters. Both were excited beyond control. When I slipped into her as she had anticipated, this woman was indeed made for fucking!</p> <p>I fucked her as hard as I cared to remember. I was not the best lover of any kind.</p> <p>Afterwards, I had a quick shower to wash the evidence of our union.</p> <p>There was no denying it.</p> <p>Her pussy still was hot. Very hot.</p> <p>It felt as tight as it did when we met.</p> <p>She had an orgasm without even touching herself.</p> <p>We dressed and went to our respective lectures.</p> <p>During my last class, she leaned over to me and whispered, "I'm sure you will make it in class." Her hand lingered on my cock as it remained rock hard.</p> <p>It did not escape my notice that I had to change subjects and then return home to her.</p> <p>She turned towards me, and kissed me on the cheek as if to thank me for the wonderful sex.</p> <p>"I love you. Have another go," she said, "and tell me about your study."</p> <p>"Well, now I'm sure that our study will be a success. Your study will be very enlightening. It's more than just a 'study' to me."</p> <p>"Well, I like my study. I like the sex. I want a little more. But my main focus is the research, I mean."</p> <p>"Hmm...okay. So the sex will be your focus. How does that sound and what if I find out about your study?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure you know very well. But after having the last sex with you, I want to try a little experiment and see how much I can work with the other aspects of our study."</p> <p>I smiled at that, "Well, I think that can be arranged. I think that I'll need some time to set up our study, then."</p> <p>"Yes, I think so. I think you need to start by experimenting. We will find the perfect method to be able to learn some new things and really improve on that theory."</p> <p>We agreed to have some extra practice, that's for sure.</p> <p>I was not able to get back home with her after our second class in our second period. My mind was racing with thoughts.</p> <p>We sat in the same chair next to the first one. She took me into her hand and led me over to the desk. She got down on her knees and started undressing me.</p> <p>It took a few seconds before I realized that she was undressing me. First she took down my jeans, then my briefs, then finally freed my cock from its confinement.</p> <p>It was a beautiful sight. A beautiful erection.</p> <p>"Now it's your turn," she said, and I turned around so that she could kiss me from behind. She kissed my back. "Let me take care of that for you," she said, as she pushed up my shirt so that everything came off.</p> <p>She took my cock in hand and guided me inside of her. She was as ready as she could be to make love again, even after our second session. She was wet. She was ready, but just a little bit of my cock went in after the first thrust.</p> <p>This time it didn't happen in slow-motion.</p> <p>She was wet, ready, eager, and eager for lovemaking. I entered her, but was not in total control of time. She was ready for lovemaking. I took hold of the base of her beautiful bottom in my fingers to force her to take more of my cock.</p> <p>She lifted her buttocks, and I rammed my cock in to the hilt. Our bodies met as one. We were united in bliss.</p> <p>We were in love. Then she stopped.</p> <p>"But do you want to continue until I come?" she asked me.</p> <p>"No," I replied, "It feels like we have a long engagement, a long engagement, but I must finish off for me to have a second." , then you." , then, we must make lovemaking. we must finish firstâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
