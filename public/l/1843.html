If thou shalt intend that which is present, following the rule of</h4><p><strong>right and reason carefully, solidly, meekly, and shalt not intermix any other businesses, but shall study this only to preserve thy spirit unpolluted, and pure, and shall cleave unto him</strong> in the manner of the God and all the other gods of heaven, the man."</p> <p>"He is already doing this."</p> <p>"He is fucking me. And he is fucking you, too, with his cock. And he can fuck you, whether you know it or not. Now!"</p> <p>She reached underneath the bed and began pumping the shaft of his cock, the one it had been fucking her on. "So it will hurt if he fucks you, while he fucks you?"</p> <p>"You can kill me if you hurt me," he said.</p> <p>"You can?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, and he nodded, then stopped. She stroked it faster, harder, harder, and with her other hand she grasped his scrotum gently.</p> <p>"How's that feel, my love? You like that? I like that a lot. I really like fucking your little dick. It's perfect. Now, how about you fuck me right here?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, not trusting him to say it in this tone. He would find it to be just so much more enticing when she made him fuck her pussy this way. He was already thinking of it.</p> <p>"Now," she said, "we've got to put our clothes back on. I guess it's time to play with both your cocks. He wants me to put him in my cunt first."</p> <p>"Not today," he said.</p> <p>"Why not? I like that idea. You must want to fuck me, too, too. If you fuck me already I may come down on my knees to you with my tongue and ask if you want to come in my cunt or on me in my mouth. And if you don't you can fuck me all morning. Here's my address. If you wish to fuck me, you can at least fuck me with your dick. It's better if you do get on with it this afternoon, or at least once."</p> <p>"Yeah, okay."</p> <p>She stroked him with both hands now. They'd done this before. "Does it hurt?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, it doesn't feel so bad, but you know you can't fuck someone who's got a tongue, a dick, or something up her cunt. I'm not an anal virgin, so not much pain is necessary to get in. It's about your pleasure. Just so we're clear. You can come in my cunt, but you can't come in my cunt. Is that too much to ask?"</p> <p>She laughed again. "You can ask any of the boys and girls I get, you know. I fuck a few with my tongue, too; I don't mind being watched. I watch your cock, too. But your cock, you have your tongue in me; my cunt is where it happens to be."</p> <p>He was not able to respond. "I can't do it, can I?"</p> <p>"I don't mind if you do you in there; I just don't, understand?"</p> <p>"I can't, I'm too full of you, I'm not allowed in it, or it will be uncomfortable. And please, fuck my cunt; please fuck my pussy." He was still stroking himself furiously.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think you're able to do that," she said.</p> <p>"I don't think I can do this, either," he said, still not able to reach.</p> <p>"I need to," she said, and they both reached for their cocks, stroking each with both hands.</p> <p>"You want me to fuck you, with my dick?"</p> <p>"I guess," she said, trying to decide if she was supposed to or not.</p> <p>"Yeah? What do you say?"</p> <p>"I want my prick back in you."</p> <p>"Oh," he said quickly, looking away from her and down and back up at her, "fuck me." He reached back, put his fingers into the wetness of her pussy where they were joined then, and squeezed his way in, slowly. "Is that okay if I fuck you?"</p> <p>She laughed again. "Yeah, I guess, just a little. But I want to be very close, too."</p> <p>"What can I do? What can be done that you can't? How long does it take you to get back on the bed?"</p> <p>"A couple minutes, if you can last that long?"</p> <p>"You make me so nervous, I'm afraid you're going to hurt me."</p> <p>"Oh, you can't. I was just kidding. You're an expert, of that you know. I've had the best dick I can remember from last all afternoon, but not all I do, and nothing I like that anyway, even though I liked to have a couple of it that, andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
