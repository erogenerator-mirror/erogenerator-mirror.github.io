Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting</strong> moments began to fade.</p> <p>"Well that's better," the blonde said and walked on to where the light faded out. She walked down to the small beach house and knocked on the door frame looking for something to do.</p> <p>"How about a beer?" the girl on the couch answered back.</p> <p>"That would be great," the student nodded back as she sat down. When it struck her that the two of them were both sitting up, she felt her cheeks turn a brighter shade of red. Her cheeks had always been a dark bronze shade with a small mole on each cheek. Her eyes had been darker in the eyes of that time period which is why they now appeared almost black as she looked back at the boy across from her.</p> <p>"I'd better go get dressed and leave," she said, as she stood up.</p> <p>"Yeah, no don't go," the girl offered. After a pause of only a blink at her friend's reaction, she grabbed her clothes and dashed off to get dressed.</p> <p>She didn't even bother to dry herself before picking up her bag and headed home. The two of them were too tired to bother with any more talk and were only in a state of confusion as they walked from the apartment house into the darkness of their home.</p> <p>"Well, that explains why I'm not wearing my panties anymore," she remarked to herself as she walked into the garage and switched on the stereo.</p> <p>After all that was over yesterday, she still really didn't much believe in sex. She always suspected that there was sex in the bedroom with a few other girls. Even though she'd never actually fucked anyone, she was still turned on. For years she'd secretly gone into relationships with different girls and found it really interesting. However, as often as her relationships had turned into some kind of a disaster, she didn't exactly have the confidence to really find it satisfying.</p> <p>"Well, I'll see you in the morning if I can find out anything," she said in a mock-innocently voice as she pulled away from the garage.</p> <p>"Yeah, be there soon," she added as she headed back towards her house to finish what she'd started yesterday. She was going to make her way home to her room after the best sex of her life. She was also going to get as much sex as possible since that day of debauchery.</p> <p>*</p> <p>The last month of August was a warm day, one of the most sexually exciting times in college history. When her classes ended, she had already showered and got dressed. Before then her usual clothes still went on and she'd even gotten a few new tops she had to try and try them on, but after she changed into a pair of slacks and a light sweater, that day she'd actually gotten a real close up of her breasts. She was glad she had something on underneath. She looked over herself in the mirror, admiring herself in the mirror as she reached into the little purse behind her and pulled out her cell phone.</p> <p>*</p> <p>She had no idea that this had gone well.</p> <p>"How about you?" it was the young man, "We can go to my house later if you'd rather, I dunno, let me finish up studying for that," he asked.</p> <p>"Sure, that would be nice."</p> <p>She looked at the back of her phone and saw that it had already begun to vibrate. She quickly turned it over to listen and found herself thinking what to do. After all, she'd had sex with another girl, not sex, but just sex. Of course, she didn't actually know what that meant, or that she knew what she was doing or where she had gotten to until now.</p> <p>But even thought she did know something of the sex-inspired sexual feeling in her that day, she'd not realized until now just that it wasn't true. There were just too many ways to feel sexually aroused and the feeling of that day with the same girl in bed every day was nothing like that. So far, the thought of going to her house afterward had always been fantasy but had never actually happened. But she was horny now, so it was all she could think about.</p> <p>"Yeah, okay."</p> <p>She had no idea at all what she thought of being horny. It had become more and more about sex since that night with Julie but they hadn't said much except how to ask and what they were doing. The only time she could focus fully on her studies was when she was standing next to the mirror as she read her text. She was the girl on the phone to read their message. She didn't even really did ask them to call them back to come to tell them what she wanted to come to come to come too. to tell she had to call to come.
