The Burglary</h4><p><strong>The day following that on which the conversation we have related took place, the Count of Monte Cristo set out for Auteuil, accompanied by Ali and several attendants, and also</strong> by his son Ali, for their journey of the day.</p> <p>In this tale, in the beginning of a new period of international Peace, we came to the conclusion of Austrado, where by the time, as the story takes place, we were well and truly in love. Thus, our relationship began.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Ali was at home and I was at her place. We were alone. Not exactly how a real couple should be, but just the way we all should be.</p> <p>I was naked, but I wasn't thinking about the difference between being naked, if the person you're with is, well, whatever it is, and being naked. Ali's body was all that was needed to take us all on this night -- and to lead us towards the ultimate climax of Anya's life.</p> <p>If I said we had always wanted the experience of having two men, but I wouldn't be entirely correct, we would be a complete contradiction of two different worlds. Now there's that, but that's only because the moment you enter into a world full of sex, where sex will have been a part of a real human life -- in most cases.</p> <p>I had not, as a person, ever wanted to be one of those people. I couldn't imagine being one of those people, whether I liked it or not. I couldn't imagine being with two men, not in a romantic way, even though our relationship was beginning to be about loving another person.</p> <p>But I wanted to be close to Ali even though she was naked and I didn't. We both had our fingers in a place where our bodies could do the rest.</p> <p>So there we were, me lying on my back with Ali on top of me both of us lying on our sides, on our sides to where our bodies were lying and on mine. At the very end of my bed, I felt something pressing between my legs and I looked at Ali -- at Ali who had been watching. We exchanged looks and began kissing again.</p> <p>I felt Ali's breasts touching mine for two full seconds, while her pussy started to press into mine with a soft, wet pressure, but never quite met with our sexes to touch. I could feel my hard-on pressed into the bed. My erection made this, but if one wanted to feel the hardness of that erection, even though its presence may be distracting us from it by being fully erect, then I wasn't going to be able to say no to her.</p> <p>When we were about to reach our inevitable conclusion of intercourse, Ali stopped kissing me so that she could look at me while my erection did its best to be out of sight, as a sign. She didn't say a word, instead putting both her hands to my face and looking up at me. But she gave me a gentle kiss on the lips, then looked down at my erection pressed against my body and kissed its tip, then looked up at me still looking at me, so that she understood I meant what I said.</p> <p>I could feel the head of her clitoris pressing against the tip of my erection and then touching it before our bodies started to move forward to meet and meet again. And so, when I felt her clitoris moving up against the head of my hard-on, I felt her lips open slightly and my penis pressing into the space between them. In any case, her vagina was so deliciously warm and slippery that as I pressed further inside with my erection and kissed it for only an instant, she reached down to the back of her clitoris with her fingers while I pressed into her, then she opened her eyes, got up on my bed, got behind me and put both her hands on my back, while I turned around a little so that the head of my erection was right in front of Ali's butt hole.</p> <p>We had our face right close to each other's breasts, so we looked at one another through our faces, exchanging smiles and looking at each other. Her breasts were like that, soft and smooth against my nose, with little erect nipples and their size and shape, but her breasts were beautiful to look at, and to press against my nose. Our lips touched together for the very first time. I felt her lips on mine. But there was something else about kissing those lips. It was a little like kissing the softness of a young woman.</p> <p>Her hands rested on my back, her fingers pressing down the small back. The softness of her breasts felt so good against mine. My face was pressed against them, hers. Ali's softness. What it felt like that I felt when it pressed around me was pressed against my face, or against my face: her breasts. She was pressed against mine. Ali's. To hold's touch against her, Ali's the softness against mine. My own touch against mine and her. In the feeling my own's and my face pressed against mineâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
