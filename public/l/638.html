It had been raining for four days. Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a</strong> small town surrounded by old oak trees, with only rain and sleet to offer refuge for the evening, it was dark and chilly in the air. The town had been under a spell of darkness for two days!</p> <p>"Do you like this?" A voice, female, said, "My little angel, can you feel it?"</p> <p>"Yeah..." she turned to the rain, "This is... is amazing!"</p> <p>"Hey," a male voice, "I remember you asking me if I could give you something to feel."</p> <p>"Yeah... um... you?" she said shyly.</p> <p>"This is my girl," he said, "She's been dying to know."</p> <p>"She's... she's such a sexy thing," she said, blushing and looking around at the street. There was no one around.</p> <p>"Hey, I know you said you liked being called the goddess," he said, "But that's still too bad. You're just a child."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"Oh, and do you want to go somewhere else?" she asked, "Just let me know."</p> <p>"Alright. I'll come along, I guess," he said as he watched her turn back to him.</p> <p>"...okay," she said.</p> <p>"You look... you look... really good...," he said, his eyes taking in the beauty of her body from head to toe.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Once they were on the road back to the hotel and in the car, he slid his hand up her leg to pull the zipper of her jeans down. He reached under her bra to cup a tit while he sucked on her nipple.</p> <p>"Mmff..." she panted, leaning back against him.</p> <p>"Yeah... that's good... now I want to try something!" he murmured.</p> <p>He reached between her legs. The zipper was already doing little to impede his progress as it pulled her pants with it down with little protest. Once he had her pants off, they fell to the floor and he stepped out of them. He reached around to hold them and lifted them into the air. Her underwear gave way in the front of his hands and she sat in the car next to him. She lifted one leg into the seat. Then the other. He pulled her underwear to the sides.</p> <p>"Wow," he said, leaning back on his hands again.</p> <p>"Nice of you to notice," she said, running her fingers over his stomach. She ran her fingers down his shaft. She rubbed at his sac and kissed the tip and he put his hand on her knee.</p> <p>"You can touch me, but, you can't be...," she started. He squeezed her leg and she groaned.</p> <p>"No it's fine..."</p> <p>He kissed her neck, "It's my job."</p> <p>He put his hand inside her underwear to feel her wetness.</p> <p>"... yeah... let me touch you..." he said, and started to slide a finger into her pussy.</p> <p>She moaned again and he put her leg back over his shoulder and lifted her knee out of the way on the seat. This time when it passed, he leaned in to kiss her again.</p> <p>"Oh god," he said, "This is so... so...,"</p> <p>He kissed her again, his dick inching its way out through his pants.</p> <p>"Okay..."</p> <p>"... okay... um... that's it... push yourself against me... hold me... oh..."</p> <p>"Ooh..." she moaned, "I can feel it!"</p> <p>"That's perfect... we don't have much time though..."</p> <p>But she didn't care.</p> <p>He pushed himself against her even though the car was a bit windy. His dick felt hard and slippery as he pressed against her.</p> <p>"Mmm, yeah... put more of your hand on me and pull it slowly."</p> <p>He slid his hand up under her bra to cup her tit.</p> <p>"Ahh," he groaned, pulling on her nipple.</p> <p>He moved his fingers back to her pussy.</p> <p>"Ahhhh... yeah... make me feel good, baby..."</p> <p>"... good...," he said, and he moved more of his dick down until her pussy was exposed to his fingers.</p> <p>"Mmfff...yeah..." she hummed and pushed against his hand against her pussy.</p> <p>"Ah that's good..." he murmured, "Can you feel it? Like this?"</p> <p>He pressed against her, her legs moving back against his now. It felt better than anything he'd imagined.</p> <p></p> <p>"Mmfffffuck... me..." she said.</p> <p></p> <p>He did his hand went right.</p> <p>"Uh, now</p> <p></p> <p>"mfasterâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
