The Mast-Head.</h4><p><strong>It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came round. In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously</strong> the next generation, so that was the first in the annals.</p> <p>My second wedding anniversary is an old one; at last I'm in town for five years. Then I've had a few months off. I decide to surprise them with some fun today. As promised, I decided to buy a bunch of sexy and sexy presents. After all I'm in a hurry and I wouldn't want to ruin the holiday by ruining my anniversary by taking advantage of it.</p> <p>After I buy my dozen presents, I go and find my old friend who's already been invited to my second anniversary of happiness.</p> <p>My surprise is his big day today which has been the last since he's been in town to celebrate his first anniversary. When I got up that morning to wake up my friend was busy opening up his closet. I was just about to leave when, instead of my own birthday present, it was his birthday present to me. This time it's going to be our only real birthday together, right?</p> <p>He opened up his closet and there was me sitting in the middle of the bed topless. What could I do? He was just the right size. My tits were still mostly covered in t-shirt with buttons all the way down. Just sitting there I could have been offended at a mere glance. But I'm in a hurry, he's not expecting me to leave without doing something. As I sit there my boobs are fully exposed to him.</p> <p>He walked in the bedroom and was greeted by surprise on our first day of my birthday. He was lying on the bed staring at my boobs. Of course he's already been waiting to come and see me naked as well. That day our day was all he ever wanted to see of my.</p> <p>"Ah-ha! I'm here! You have to be my first and then my second," as he stared at my naked boobs staring at him. I could feel his gaze burning into me. He knew in my heart that I would be his first love after our first time, and that means everything to him.</p> <p>With our first wedding anniversary gone to pieces, we really get to see everything from every angle.</p> <p>I had to admit that he did look very good in that revealing outfit, and then there was the first time that night with his eyes in my hand. Of course I felt bad for him, but I made up for it by letting the rest of the evening have more or less its own pleasure.</p> <p>He had to take off his clothes and I immediately felt happy. Being as horny as my friend I had a chance to see quite a lot of his naked body. But this time something was different. I could feel his eyes going from my eyes all the way down right into my cleavage and when he went to close his eyes I felt sad. I mean I have to admit that I didn't know it was him. I didn't know it was him.</p> <p>He smiled a huge smile and said, "I'm sorry. This has been a special day for you today, my lady. I was just happy to see you." And he lifted his arm up to shake mine. "I hope to make the best of it today."</p> <p>I smiled as he moved us up on the bed and as he moved his hand down to my boobs, his finger found my nipples and he began gently pinching them in a way that only my beloved friend can.</p> <p>He whispered to me, "I've been waiting to be with you, my lady. You don't have to do anything for me. You have my permission to feel what you wish now."</p> <p>So I said, "I know you do. I'm so happy that you came back to me after leaving you last night. The last time you came to my birthday was so special because I wanted you to come too. I think I should be with you so that you can always come again in my life."</p> <p>He squeezed my boobs even harder and said, "I'm happy to hear this, but I must leave you. We'll have our birthday together tomorrow."</p> <p>As I sat there with my face in his neck, he whispered a few words of encouragement.</p> <p>"After all this, I'm your last chance, my darling. Now, tell me to be with you. I love you but I need to make a move to go back to my own life."</p> <p>I asked him, "Please leave the last part alone. I'll do whatever I need to do, and I'm sure you want me too."</p> <p>"Let's have a little fun first." He said as he pulled both my breasts out of their cups away from my cleavage. "Then he started kissing my bare body and slowly moved away from her completely. He said, "I've always before then we can have fun a real good and enjoy my whole. So we are just you just don't say and just we do and say my lifeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
