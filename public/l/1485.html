The</strong> women looked across at each other.</p> <p>"I am happy to have been invited to this."</p> <p>"Me too!"</p> <p>They looked back at the woman at their sides. She looked like the famous actress. While, though she was younger than her, she was gorgeous and she could get any man to touch her. And she was on her hands and knees, so his hands could roam freely. Sometimes she would let him kneel before him, and he could kiss the most intimate places of her body before she could stop him. Or he could suckle and fuck her, her body was her place to make him feel, too. Or he could take her ass. In any case, she was his. So she could take all of him, at once and feel everything he could do to her. Her body was his gift to make him happy. She opened her mouth wide and kissed him.</p> <p>The kiss was a warm, passionate one. His tongue teased her lips open and pushed inside. They fit so well, she knew she loved him as his tongue found hers and slid inside. And when he found her clit with his fingers, she moaned. It was a wonderful feeling. She could feel her juices running out of her and down her legs into her underwear.</p> <p>When her father's tongue explored her mouth, she knew she should be feeling him, because she knew what it meant. Her father had not only become her father, he was her father-in-law. He had been the one to take charge in all of her matters. And not only did she know what to do with her hands, which she loved so much; but because the man who did such fine things had done so much for her and that made her feel good. And as she was feeling him inside her, she was feeling all of him once again, and with his tongue exploring her mouth and kissing her, she could feel him inside her.</p> <p>With all of him inside her, they didn't stop kissing until the time when she was crying out and he was spilling hot blood all over her legs and thighs. This time, she felt him inside her the first time they had made love, and he loved it.</p> <p>"Let us move out for a bit, honey," she whispered, holding her head in her hands and closing her eyes.</p> <p>When their eyes were still closed, they were smiling. It was a beautiful moment. For their first time.</p> <p>"I love you, Daddy."</p> <p>"I love you, tooâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
