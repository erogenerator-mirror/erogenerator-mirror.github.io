English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXIII — HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED</h4><p><strong>I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless they are very careful</strong> about their habits. We can't all get what we need from the wrong person, because the wrong person only fucks with us.</p> <p>We can't all fuck with each other.</p> <p>In a way, we can't have fucked each other. If we fucked each other the same way you do, we would both be the same person. A man, a woman, a relationship, a relationship.</p> <p>There are two of us fucking with each other and loving each other as much as we love each other, and we can both fuck each other.</p> <p>In a different way, I can't have fucked each of your friends with my cock. However, I could have put up with fucking each of you with my cock. As a result, I'd never be able to fuck anyone else with my cock. And, as I told you, men are a sexual organ which creates a fantasy universe and thus a dangerous one which is best avoided because it is the sin of sexual intercourse which causes people to get sick from sexual activities.</p> <p>I know. It's a cliché.</p> <p>There are few men who have actually put their own personal or personal sex lives in question, because for them, there would be no sexual relationships, except in the fantasy world.</p> <p>The men that men fuck with have actually had the same type of sex lives as many others: men fucking women with sex toys, sex toys being put in their mouths, being fucked with cum in mouths, cum in ass for them, cum in ass for them, blow up in cars for them, blow up in houses for them, etc. We're all the same people, so it's okay with me to say that men with their personal sexual activities have had the same type of sexual lives as some of the women in our own worlds.</p> <p>The men that have fucked each other have been men with the same type of sexual activities. And the men are also all of the same species from where I come from: men with whom I have sex with, women with whom I have sex with, men with whom, men with whom I have sex with, men with whom to me, women with whom I have sex with, men with whom to me, men with whom to me, and yes, men with whom to me, women with whom I have sex with.</p> <p>Women can have the same level of sexual activity as men.</p> <p>The men that fuck each other will be the same sexual species, in the same manner as men.</p> <p>The men who fuck each other in the same way will not be the same sex species as women have with men.</p> <p>And, for the women that fuck men, there is an additional possibility to have the same level of sexual activity as men.</p> <p>Women can be the same sexual species.</p> <p>You're the same species that fuck me.</p> <p>The men that lick me, you make me cum, you make me cum, you make me cum, you make me cum.</p> <p>You're the same species that fuck me.</p> <p>The men that fuck each other will be the same sex species as women have with men.</p> <p>The men who suck our cocks will be the same sex species as women have with men.</p> <p>The men who are men are the same sex species with women.</p> <p>The men who are sex animals are the same sex species with men even if with them.</p> <p>And, for the women who fuck each other, there is a chance that we have more sex than men with some of the same sexual activities. I do not like the fact that I have never been in a porno. I like that I can watch myself sucking cock and cum. I like that there are no real orgasms just for guys in the porno world. The sex is just a bit too much for some men.</p> <p>Women are the same species that fuck me.</p> <p>They can fuck each other as well as men as they can suck each other. She wants to suck me, and when I'm fucking her, I want to suck her. She wants to fuck me. She can fuck me.</p> <p>If she wants to fuck me, I want to suck her. I want to swallow her cum. I want to suck the cum out of her body. I want to lick her pussy, give her a facial, and then fuck her with my tongue. When I'm fucking her, I want to lick her clit. I do want to drink her cum. I want to suck her cum. I want to swallow her cum. I want to use my tongue on her clit. I want to stick my tongue in her pussy. I want to lick her clit.</p> <p>I want to lick her asshole with my tongue. and I want to eat her asshole. I want to eat her pussy. that is she loves licking me, to eat her. to drink her cum, to fuck me, but I want to fuck me and fuck her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
