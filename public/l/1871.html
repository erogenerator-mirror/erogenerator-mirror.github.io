He is a true fugitive, that flies from reason, by which men are</h4><p><strong>sociable. He blind, who cannot see with the eyes of his understanding. He poor, that stands in need of another, and hath not in himself all things needful for this</strong>. The best of the world to find a good time, and all others of my world are thus as I hath not a care.</p> <p>He was a fool to think his love hath not the mind of my love, and to give my love so. How can I be so blind, my joy at the time, at every occasion? I am never blind in all this world, and never, if it be to some reason. I know what I am, and know how to please myself. Of course, many have made mistakes here. I should take lessons from them. Such mistakes can all be mine. To love is of course a gift, only a gift for others.</p> <p>The next morning, I left the bed in the bathroom, and went to the bathroom-bathroom where my love, and I lay. I was still awake when he entered the bed, but as he spooned with my back and the curve of my ass, I could hear him in the low sound of his breathing. It was all right, my love, he did nothing. And, it was a good thing, and I enjoyed it. I knew that he was also in sleep, because I felt his breathing on my left cheek.</p> <p>"Love, I can't. I did too late in the morning."</p> <p>I whispered my worries there, and then he said: "Love, we are not together. Not any longer; it all a one-night stand."</p> <p>My love said, "Let us both sleep in one night, in one way or the other. Let us both do the things that were meant to be done, and let us be one."</p> <p>"Let us both do them, for we all will do them; no one can say which we all love."</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered in his mind.</p> <p>And it's all right to look back and say what we did. He's taken up at the moment, and now he will be doing it very freely and in my bed. He'll be fucking me right now, and in my bed, right where I slept all those years and I don't know where else to go: in the bath, on the shower, between my legs and there and there, over my face and everywhere else on my body, anywhere it's possible.</p> <p>I did not lie, I do not lie, for our time of passion is over. I want you to be inside me, now.</p> <p>With this he kissed me and said: I need to be inside you soon like this. He took his cock in his hand and rubbed it along my slit. He touched me there, where all my secretions, all my wetness, was waiting for him. Then he asked me if I understood what he was doing, and I whispered yes, while he felt around my opening to find some lubrication. He pushed some finger into my pussy, inside me some and out, and when he was happy with this, he put a finger into his wife's vagina, which he found also in his own mouth.</p> <p>Then he gave me a very hard kiss, and put the finger back in, as he had done with other girls I had had and was now doing. This time he could see it in my face. I was in the zone of pleasure at this first of a long, sensual fuck. His lips touched mine, our tongues danced together, and we both came together, and we had our first French kiss.</p> <p>It was a long kiss, it was a French kiss with love at first but then with lust, but the first one was not just a kiss and a quick fuck as a friend's fuck, it was more, well.</p> <p>After his kiss, we got up and went to an empty room; we had been on the bed for a long time now. We went behind one another, and he was on me, and we were doing it for the first time.</p> <p>I was in the morning. He was still sleeping, and he asked me to take the condom from its bed. I did, and the condom came out. He said he was still naked, and that we must be careful. We must do this the proper way; we had already done it with the other girls. I took him in my mouth first, and started sucking him hard; this time it was the first thing I could do and not the usual, and as he enjoyed it, I got more excited and he got bigger.</p> <p>I felt his hand on my neck, while I worked on him. He pushed his hips, and his cock entered my wet and ready pussy, and we both came, and came again, and again. That first time was great. He made me cum, and a hundred times, and all by his life, by the first one night with one time the night.</p> <p></p> <p>(2/2/2/2/3/2/>-2-3-2â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
