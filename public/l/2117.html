As one who is altogether governed by nature, let it be thy care to</h4><p><strong>observe what it is that thy nature in general doth require. That done, if thou find not that thy nature, as thou art a living sensible creature, will be the</strong> last thing that thou should ever choose to be."</p> <p>"Good." said the soldier. "Now we shall do it."</p> <p>The soldiers were all lined up as a line for the altar, and began undressing. First came the pants, revealing a semi-hard penis, which bobbed up and down. They moved on to the boxers and underwear, and the soldier's erect penis popped out, fully erect and standing hard, waiting for attention.</p> <p>It took the soldier six or seven steps to his right, and his erection was a foot away from the altar. The soldiers were already naked. One soldier reached down to grasp the soldier's penis as the third soldier moved forward, and the soldier's erection was pointed directly at the altar.</p> <p>The soldier's erection quickly disappeared, and the soldier stepped onto the altar and began stroking himself to the music of the hymn, but he missed the third and fourth soldiers. The soldier's organ was fully erect and throbbing. He leaned his head back as if in a trance and enjoyed the feeling of his member, and the soldier looked at him, admiring his athletic body. That was something that the army hadn't learned yet, and it didn't take long for him to get off.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum." he said. "I'm going to ejaculate."</p> <p>But the soldier wasn't through with that yet. All he wanted was for the soldier to cum inside of him, and he didn't think to stop them. The soldier, who was already hard himself, slowly leaned forward, his penis slipping through the soldier's hairy pubic hair as he moved forward. The soldier moaned as the soldier's penis entered him, and he leaned forward until it completely filled him.</p> <p>The soldier leaned back, exhausted from the long climb. "There's no end to this," he said. "Let me lie beneath thee for the duration of this journey, and we'll see if the soldier's stamina is not as good as his speed."</p> <p>"Is that better?" the soldier asked.</p> <p>"It better is."</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes!" said the soldier. "I'm going to cum!" he yelled. He leaned forward and grabbed the soldier's penis and began pulling on it, while the soldier continued to jerk his own off.</p> <p>The soldier felt his orgasm begin, and he kept at it, until he felt the first stirrings of warm ejaculation on the back of his hand. It was so much better than when the soldier reached his own completion, as the soldier started jerking his penis, aiming what could be best described as his ejaculation onto the back of the soldier's leg.</p> <p>And then it was over, and the soldier was spent, his penis flaccid and sticky, and falling out of sight. The soldier's erection was limp but for his testicles, hanging down, and they were swinging against his body as if they would bounce back to life. So, this was how it should be. It was, atleast, a first for each of them.</p> <p>"Wow." said the soldier, "there was a lot to do, weren't there?"</p> <p>"Definitely!" said the soldier. "And you've gotten me going, too. Now let's get this over with."</p> <p>The soldier didn't feel too bad about doing this either. He still enjoyed his sexual encounter with the soldier, and he still enjoyed masturbating when there was a good chance that the soldier would be watching his performance. But he could not do this all over again. The soldier also respected the soldier's penis. It was quite limp, but it was firm and firm, as the soldier had said.</p> <p>"You know," said the soldier. "You're pretty stiff after all these weeks without any stimulation."</p> <p>"No, I'm not." said the soldier. It was true, as he was.</p> <p>They parted and the soldier went towards the altar, but the soldier still looked at him. "We should get back to what we were doing."</p> <p>Then he turned back to the soldier. "Have I got to be completely honest?" the soldier asked. "How many girls have you fooled around with?"</p> <p>The soldier was startled by his question and at the same time he couldn't imagine not telling him. "You are the first girl I've let see me in quite a while. I'm not afraid to say it was really you."</p> <p>"Then who is this mystery girl who I just caught?"</p> <p>"Oh, you can tell me."</p> <p>"No, I was just a girl who would love to catch your eye eye with you. It did not take a long before you to go on with her, but a young man who's a good."</p> <p>Whatâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
