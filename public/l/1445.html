So she made a fire on her hearth, and</strong> waited by the hearth. In the hot heat of the hearth she wished an easy orgasm to occur, so the duke was pleased to watch a beautiful young girl who was so sweet but so desperate to please him, so eager to know his desires, so eager to please him himself. Then, she heard the hearth chiming in time with one of her prayers.</p> <p>Then the hearth chimerised.</p> <p>She had heard the sound of her prayers many times, and she knelt before the hearth for the first time since her mother's death. She felt as naked as she was to have such an honor. Her mother's death was a terrible fate, a curse of an eternal youth. It had always been that way. Now it was her destiny, hers to bless her. When she entered her village a little later, the hearth chimerised. And she entered it.</p> <p>As usual, every time she entered the village, the duke would summon several girls and wait for her. When she entered, he and his friends would all gather around her and give her thanks. Sometimes the duke waited before entering the house with all his friends. Sometimes he would tell her that she was beautiful, he wished to have an orgasm as she knelt before him.
