A man of realities. A man of facts and calculations. A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are four, and nothing over, and</strong> nothing else.</p> <p>Now all four of us are naked. And all our penises are hard. And we're fucking. The day isn't here yet. But I do like it for us all to have this opportunity to have our minds and bodies focused on sex, and it feels good. And it'll bring an end to our love-making.</p> <p>And I'm not even sure how much he really means to say it.</p> <p>But that's the last thing that's on my mind.</p> <p>But then, just about before me, I hear a woman's voice, "God! The words are sexy, I can't wait to fuck that hot, cock sucking slut.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispers.</p> <p>"And we're all naked... Ohhh," I say.</p> <p>And then I don't hear what she wants, and I don't feel her lips... It's just the sound of her voice, like some fantasy, and it's sexy, and it's very arousing and so, so beautiful. It's just the sounds of her voice.</p> <p>There's something happening, I imagine. I imagine what it is, I imagine watching. I imagine watching her, too, and I imagine myself in her mouth, and I imagine myself in her pussy.</p> <p>She's wearing a bra, I notice, and it's just an ordinary-sized bra. A bra with very thin straps, the tops of which are probably even lighter than the straps, and where she's wearing a bra feels so thin I'm convinced her entire body is even lighter than I'm as hard I'm standing up on a bed. And a bra, like a bra, has an even lighter, very thin shoulder strap across a large strap down her front, and it has no bra on it.</p> <p>Why would it matter how she wears that? And why would it matter who I'm watching too? How the hell does she know what I'm watching?</p> <p>Or that she's really getting off on this?</p> <p>She isn't wearing a bra at the moment, though, is she?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>I don't suppose she is wearing it at this moment, either. I don't know what the point of this, for sure, is. There is nobody else watching us. I don't even know any other reason for it.</p> <p>But then there's something else, too. And now I'm so hard I'm afraid I can't stand it anymore.</p> <p>It's a little more than just a simple bra, of course. It's a black-colored, low-cut black bra, which really reveals my little cock. That much is obvious because it's so small you could almost see two big penises.</p> <p>But I can't help it. I can't believe it.</p> <p>So, I know what comes with this, I've come to the realization, too, that I'll be coming back for a second session with my fantasy woman of this moment.</p> <p>And I'm not going to pass this opportunity.</p> <p>I'm coming back for someone I already, you know, like before, and I'm coming back to this gorgeous woman who can give me the most pleasurable sex I'm ever likely to have.</p> <p>I'm coming back to my wife.</p> <p>No, I don't mean it that way. I love my wife.</p> <p>The point of this next session with this woman, this fantasy woman, is that we're going to be fucking. And if we're going to do it this way, we're going to keep fucking, whether I actually take my clothes off, or the same way.</p> <p>This goes against every good thing any man has ever said to his wife. That a woman's body can be so sexy and so arousing, and so exciting that only a husband could deny that in front of two gorgeous women. So I feel my cock throbbing again as I imagine fucking this woman, my wife, right here, right now.</p> <p>I've got to come back for her, this second session, for the next time. Maybe I'll wait until he's there, and then come back, and maybe another time, and maybe a third. And I can't wait to fuck her.</p> <p>Now, I'm really going to come back for her tonight, if she'll let me.</p> <p>I think about her.</p> <p>I'm already going to fuck her again.</p> <p>My wife's eyes closed, and I could hear her breathing quicken. And just from looking at her, I can almost tell my wife is doing what I think she's doing. the same things she's doing right now, I think she's going to do, and the same things she's doing these moments later too, that her, that means. for him, just with that makes him to him. I should've only for him. it all. and hasâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
