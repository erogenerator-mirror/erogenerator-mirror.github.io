The nature of the universe, of the common substance of all things</h4><p><strong>as it were of so much wax hath now perchance formed a horse; and then, destroying that figure, hath new tempered and fashioned the matter of it into the form</strong> of a tree.</p> <p>A time to cut my hair and make it long, which I'm not proud of, but, just as I'm not as good a time as she, I'm going to cut my hair short and make it as long as it pleases me to be her hair, and long as it pleases her. The perfect time, is in this moment.</p> <p>A time to enjoy the wonders of a perfect, perfect, perfect time, I'm going to fuck and be fucked, by a gorgeous woman and an amazing, beautiful woman; a girl who enjoys sex and will happily be my personal fuck toy. Yes, I'm going to fuck her and be her lover. I won't deny I have had some dalliances with some of her friend friends at college but I've never made an effort to be a party to it.</p> <p>I'm going to suck and fuck her and make her come with my mouth and tongue. There, we shall both make a difference at each other's first time.</p> <p>She is my perfect girlfriend. I have a girlfriend? She just so happens to be my girlfriend. I don't regret it now but I'll do my best to make my life a success.</p> <p>"How's that?" I ask and then, as if I care, she smiles at me and then says, "Oh, sorry," in a tone of humor that is completely devoid of all emotion. "You have a lovely figure," I smile back at her and then make my way to the bed.</p> <p>I sit opposite of her, and I am instantly aroused because we're both lying on our sides. She is as beautiful as she is amazing. We have a beautiful and unique relationship.</p> <p>We can't have sex and then be fucking each of these other. I have to have it. I've kissed her breasts a few times, and I've even felt on my knees just how much I had made love to and loved and missed her breasts. I've enjoyed them, I've given myself to her.</p> <p>"So are you and your other boyfriends bisexual, or bi-curious?" I ask, with one hand on the pillow and one on the inside of her left leg, as if I'm reading her mind.</p> <p>"No, it's a guy thing. Some people don't have it so much." She explains, with her hand up on her chest showing me just as much of her as she does. "We'll get together this weekend and we'll have sex, and I might even bring my girl friend," she says with one of her beautiful smiles. "This is kind of wild, doesn't it?," she says, with that sexy smile again.</p> <p>"Mmm," I reply, with my arms around her hips, pulling her slightly towards me so that she can feel the pressure against her pussy. "It was kind of like fucking. The sex is not necessarily so long as one doesn't take it too fast. But, you never know what it will be like with you and your roommate." "Oh, yeah," she replies, with one hand on top of mine, but her eyes are closed and she is enjoying that first sexual experience as she puts her arms around my neck. "You're quite the hunk," she whispers. Her hips are gently moving back and forth against me. "Your cocks are pretty good, but that's something I want to try just once more," she adds, looking away to let me know what this means. "If I can't have you, it's okay," she adds, her face becoming a little apprehensive. "If I'm going to make love with you, then I want to do it with someone else," she says. "You're my roommate," she whispers.</p> <p>I feel my cock, in my pants, begin to harden. I turn my head away to watch her and my cock reacts with both the shock of her words and the sexual stimulation that is now coursing through me. It is as if someone has pressed a button inside my brain. "If you don't mind, could I just...do you have any lube?" I ask her and she looks at me, as if her request would be acceptable.</p> <p>"Of course not," she replies. "I don't think I can get pregnant by just one guy," she tells me, with her voice shaking. "I never felt this way. "But, if you want to, you know, just use some on me for a little while." Her words are filled with a softness that is an act of trust. It is like she is saying that she can trust me, and that she knows it's okay with me. She's telling me.</p> <p>this through her.</p> <p>"Would you don't know it would be wrong?"</p> <p>through â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
