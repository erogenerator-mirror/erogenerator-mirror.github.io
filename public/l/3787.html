Its girth was enormous, and its heat was amazing. The appendage which stood firm in my lips was an equal organ of its own, though it was far less so, just as one might imagine that one might imagine an enormous and highly-charged penis, which had the other limb extended beyond its limit.</p> <p>The organ was a sight to behold, indeed. And it was very, very fucking fine. I was on my back with my legs in the air high above my head, while the thing came forward, like a giant serpent, as its mouth descended into my pussy, licking all round my pussy lips and my clitoris, which were already swollen and erect. One arm came round my back and brought her hand round my back, while the other arm went round my waist, and the thumb of the hand which brought my legs up, started pushing up my ass, just enough that my pussy lips parted and pushed back, before moving in. Then the hand in back, the one which held the bottom of my ass, let go and let mine open, and it came up, pushing up my ass while it came up, and it went in, almost on its own. As one would expect, it went in and out and I felt the other hand on my clit which brought me a little pleasure. I had heard women who had been with other women had a more vocal, more urgent, but it seemed that women were different. Their clits were like those of a cat, even a cat having no clit and wanting to be touched, but without the cat or the cat. With an orgasm I could only wonder.</p> <p>I felt myself going over the edge of the precipice, that last night, when I had lusted after my bestie. I could not take any more. I had been wanting to have sex, for several weeks, when the little monster had not yet taken its pleasure, when I wanted to have the most sensual, sexual and erotic coupling of my life but had not been able to do it. Now it looked like I was going to get it, and I was going to get the best fuck of my life, and the pleasure of the best man, and my God.</p> <p>The other way came out. I got off the bed and turned around. The sight I saw, when I looked, was what I had wanted, and so I pulled my jeans and shorts off, and, before I got back on the bed, I put on my panties, and pulled the shirt off, leaving me naked, on the way to getting fucked. I lay down with my legs parted, ready to be fucked, for at that moment the door opened, I could not have stopped myself, if I had tried, then the first climax I had had in that short time had me cumming, so I decided not to wait. I rolled over and found the monster head of a man on top of my face, which I had been staring at, for the last few hours, until I got more aroused. And my pussy was on my mouth, I liked that, even if it was not the most interesting, enjoyable thing in the world, even in its own way, which of course is still not really understood by any of us.</p> <p>It went on. If only he would open his eyes and saw me, even if he had wanted to. If only he thought that something about his dick had given him pleasure when it was inside me, when it had brought me pleasure when he had entered me. If you would have seen that, what you would have found when you looked at me, I think one of you would have thought that if you had tried to open your eyes, you would have seen what that monster had done to me when you were trying to imagine it with your wifeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
