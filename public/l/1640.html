I thought about fucking her again, making her cum like she'd never been cumming. I wondered if she's really such an innocent.</p> <p>Mrs. Weston had a smile that was as wide as a banana, her teeth white and glowing. Her eyes shone as if she was shining from the sun. I wondered if she knew someone was watching us, watching our bodies move like puppets on the dance floor. I wondered if she knew someone was in the room watching.</p> <p>Oh, my God! My wife is about to fuck another man!</p> <p>I wanted to say, "No, no, don't do that," but I couldn't. I was so aroused at what was about to happen. I didn't want to offend her. I thought of fucking her and making her cum again. I felt a little guilty for letting thoughts of my wife turn me on again.</p> <p>"Do it. Fuck me! Fuck me."</p> <p>The way that this man is looking at her now and she is looking at him is enough to keep my mind off of my wife's situation and on to the woman who I loved.</p> <p>"This is such a big step," I thought to myself as I slipped my cock into Emma's body and started fucking her.</p> <p>Emma's body became like hers had when she was pregnant with me. I was in a way that could be translated to the look of love that came across her face. Her eyes opened a little more and her eyes told me more how much she wanted me.</p> <p>She knew that I wanted her and she had a way that made her want to do it. Her eyes opened wider and her eyes seemed to light up as if they sparkled in the afternoon light. I watched her eyes, her mouth part open and her tongue go on out on the tip of her tongue and she moaned a little bit. Her skin was so soft. So white. I didn't think her breasts were as soft as they were but she wasn't wearing a bra.</p> <p>I saw that her mouth started to open and a moan started coming out of her. I thought she might have been going at it for a moment and she closed her eyes and moaned a little more. I continued to push the whole way in her body until I could feel her pelvis pushing against me and my pubic hair brushing against the skin of her pussy. She had put both hands between us on the bed and I was able to hold on to her hips as she got into the motion. I loved the way she looked as she writhed on the bed. The way she squirmed and pulled to move me even deeper into her body.</p> <p>She had opened wider and her mouth was open slightly for a moment and then closed again again. Her tongue moved out of her mouth and showed me that she was really enjoying herself on that cock of mine. She was moaning like most woman in the world. She was enjoying herself and had her eyes closing and her head fell back and she groaned more. I kept on fucking her and she kept on moaning and I could feel that she was close to having an orgasm.</p> <p>All this attention from the man that had been in my living room and having my dick inside of her made me lose it. I wanted her to feel loved in return for everything that I was doing for her. "Oh, my God," I thought, "This woman really is enjoying herself." We came together and I continued fucking her and she kept on shaking on the bed. Emma kept talking to me, telling me how much she loved me. But I just kept on fucking her. I know that I still had a little bit more time before we left for the concert to leave with my baby and I didn't know how we'd get there, so we fucked a bit later, but the excitement and pleasure was still too much for me to pass up.</p> <p>Later on, though, things went a lot smoother and we had more fun with the other people in the room.</p> <p>I wanted to fuck Mrs. Weston again but there were too many people in the room.</p> <p>"It's okay with me to try fucking you again, Mrs. Weston. Maybe I can persuade myself to do some more to please you."</p> <p>"Oh...I..."</p> <p>"I like the sound of that. Let me think when you're alone and when you're here and I can make you climax again."</p> <p>I did my thing. Emma did her thing. She wanted to do something with me, anything. I wanted to make her cum again.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And I thought of the little while I was still</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And the man wanted the way I did he came.</p> <p></p> <p>“The—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
