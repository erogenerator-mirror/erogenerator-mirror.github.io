For not observing the state of another man’s soul, scarce was ever</h4><p><strong>any man known to be unhappy. Tell whosoever they be that intend not, and guide not by reason and discretion the motions of their own souls, they must of necessity</strong>. That's all. So, they must at times be the caretaker of their own life, and that time will judge their own lives and their own minds. If so, and if the caretaker's own minds be this: You give as much of yourself as you can take, without losing a single bit of the joy of your first time—the joy of a real man having the joy of a real woman having the joy of fucking, and if you like it you'll feel that joy. If not, you give yourself to the caretaker, and you'll experience the joy of this life of happiness—the joy of being taken, the joy of being fulfilled, and of having the joy of love, and of being the caretaker herself, just to enjoy the joy of fucking. If not, you give yourself to the caretaker, and you'll have the joy of being fucked by someone who wants to fuck you.</p> <p>So, the life is what you give yourselves to. And the life is what the caretaker has you through. And she's all too glad to come to work for you at this moment. This is a great job. This is the life you give to one man, but you know that you know that this is a job for a man of your own name, and that you can never give this life up.</p> <p>You come by this job with your heart in a heart that is heart and heart, and the caretaker is happy when he's pleased for you. The caretaker loves you. The caretaker loves men, and women, and all of them, and for you he is happy. In the end, your life is just like that of many other lives, and you are just like many others.</p> <p>Now, you can come at any size, by any speed, by any strength. You just might find that you'll never tire of fucking. You just might find that you'll live in some little corner of the world at a time when it's a little quiet, but the thought of fucking and going back to where it was before the time of it is more fun. Of course, you know that it is better when the caretaker comes in, but you know that it's better when her is there. Don't you know that, as much as anyone else, what a fuck is worth if you can't fuck it out of you?</p> <p>Sometimes, even if it was a big day or because no one else was home, the caringtaker will visit with you, as a matter of routine. She may go to work if you have to. She may come back to your room, or she may come home, and you'll know that she's with you. You've been here for many years, and you have your own little corner of the world. Of course, she's never actually fucking you. It's the caretaker who comes to your room. And you're just a man who comes to her room. Don't you have the pleasure of fucking her? You're the man whose life means something to you. He's the man who comes to her room. The man who comes to her room to fuck her and fuck her back. The man standing before you who comes to her bed time and time again because, as soon as you come, he has to. You're fucking her, or giving her pleasure.</p> <p>You know that it's better to fuck than to let love consume you. She likes it that way. Some people like it that way. A fuck comes from a little love, and if love takes over all of it, that's what you want is a good fuck. And, if love knows love knows the meaning of loving, and for you to fuck and just enjoy it when you can, you can fuck and just let it consume you.</p> <p>You know that you can't be the best fucker, and that you can't be good enough. You're not the best fucker. You don't exist. You're not the one fucking me, but you were. And you didn't just think you were good at it. You were fucking, but you weren't fucking. You were fucking.</p> <p>There'll always be plenty of a man out there who has an inner-self. A fucker whose heart and soul are deep in the caretaker's side.</p> <p>Love knows. But there ain't no love, and there is no love without something else: A woman knows a good fucker, a fucker's heart, and if there ain't no love, then who cares what that other man can do to you, or make you fuck?</p> <p>Love knows.</p> <p>Love knows.</p> <p>Love knows, but you can't. that you're fucking. There's no love even, or fucking, or not even thinking like this.</p> <p>and not.,</p> <p>and not and in the world's not fucking—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
