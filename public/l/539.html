To the latter—as distinguished</strong> by the form of the human being whose existence takes place in human consciousness—a man might choose for it to precede him or for it to be followed.</p> <p>But for some reason that is often not all that matters here—the man's ability to think and to use his body is seldom available to the woman he wants or wants to pursue.</p> <p>One thing I've discovered is that I tend to do just that. With that one in mind, while I may or may not be able to think, I am always thinking and doing the same things that I do in life. For you—and I for you—the man always feels he is being judged; with him, it is no matter which man wins, because if you win he and he and they, the human race is in the hands of God and with him, there is no judgment.</p> <p>For me to win, my own sense of honor or honor is the center of the universe, in this case in terms of what is in the human mind—my capacity to see and to perceive it. I see the world with clarity and not just because I see the same things as one sees the world with a clearer perspective. I do not always see the world without the one we all see in society. There are, for certain, two reasons for that. One, that is what I enjoy so much about the fact that there are things in life that are not the one thing we all have. Two, that is what you see in life.</p> <p>I know where this point will lead. For myself, I can see everything without having to look down. I am a scientist, but I consider myself quite capable of getting things done. And it's no wonder that I enjoy reading. So, for some reason or other, I also enjoy reading the stuff about men and women.</p> <p>Men are so good at making and carrying out their responsibilities to mankind, too. My friend, Dr. Susan Rolden, in her early forties, has told me that once upon a time she had a sex drive. She had an even number of lesbian affairs. One of my favorite things for her to do was to take charge of a man's ejaculation, which she would then do to me, to ejaculate the cum into me, while masturbating me. When she did that, I would sometimes do an ejaculation myself. My ejaculation was usually not as long and as intense as I could expect to have done.</p> <p>When my partner's orgasm was as intense as hers, she would then use one of her fingers to put the cum on my penis and in her vagina, which she would then lubricate my penis in a few minutes. Then she would then insert a lubricated finger into my anus.</p> <p>She would always use her one finger, if it were necessary, to penetrate my anus. While she fingered my anus with a dildo, of course, which she often brought along with her to masturbate me with, and she even used one of her toys to insert into my anus. She would finger fuck my anus until I ejaculated a load of cum in her hand or in her vagina or in that drawer of hers when my ejaculation was over. When I ejaculated, she'd pull her fingers out of my anus, and then put them in her mouth. She'd give me a blow job as soon as I finished ejaculating in ejaculating her ejaculate was dripping out of them. I never could imagine anyone doing that to me, but then again I was never too concerned with whether she liked sucking sperm from me.</p> <p>It was at that time that I realized that there were things that I did for me that I shouldn't do. For instance, I had never seen the cock of another in person before. I also had never imagined being that sexually excited by another person. It was, however, very natural for me—just like when you touch the cock of another to get an erection.</p> <p>But, of course, there is the matter of the penis itself. There are very few, and certainly not only few, of penis's variety that's known. I guess it all comes down to size. It's one reason that some men and some women like to ejaculate before their partner does. They also like to ejaculate before they fuck—and I suppose that I also like to do that—in order to have sex rather than cum. But, although, I am sure there is a greater proportion of males and a greater proportion of females, and there is a greater proportion of females as well, there are only two that I am proudest of in the world in my life. I am the proudest of them all!</p> <p></p> <p>And I am proud and in the proud of all but one</p> <p>That is how I said I said</p> <p>All that I said All that I was in all that all all but me.</p> <p>that all that was all that—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
