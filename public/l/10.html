Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to</strong> make more love to her. At night, at first, they only lay together. But over the next few weeks, they had both gotten a chance to spend a bit of time together: more time with the two of them. When they were lying together in Miss Hartigan's bed, they kissed gently, then began to gently kiss once more. Their lips pressed against each other's with eager passion. Their mouths opened and their tongues explored each other. They both knew what they really wanted, and, after what they were doing, they each wanted to get inside each other's minds.</p> <p>The two lovers started off softly: first, making out, taking each other's shirts off, and slowly removing each others' jeans. After each other stripped down to their underwear, they kissed the other and then each other. They both stood, and they kissed again, this time more passionately. Their hands caressed each other, and their tongues probed each other's mouths. Their cocks pressed against each other, and their hands roamed all over each other's bodies. Their lips and tongues explored each other's bodies, and their fingertips probed each other's genitals, and probed and massaged each others' buttocks. Their fingertips and fingernails ran against each other, and they caressed each other's backsides. The two lovers kissed, held the other and both felt their bodies getting bigger, more alive, more ready for the other. Their eyes were shut; their lips parted again, and their tongues touched each other. Their hands began to play together. They touched their nipples, and they cupped each other's breasts, and they rubbed their bodies against each other. Their hands kneaded, caressed, and caressed each other's breasts. Both of them found their heads bobbing toward the other's groin (that much more so). Neither of them needed to wait long between kisses; the other's clitoris was rapidly growing, and both of them eagerly took turns kissing it, rubbing it with their fingers. Their hands rubbed each other's buttocks, and they pressed their hands against their breasts. With their mouths clapping together, they rolled away, and kissed again, passionately, their hands feeling each other's bodies. In the blink of an eye, they each felt their cocks getting harder, their balls rising. Their hands were in each other's asses, their hard cocks pressed against each other's pussies, moving along their backsides, their heads, sliding over each other's belly, rubbing their chests, and their faces. Their kisses were now full of saliva, and their lips quivered as they slid their lips over those lips, their teeth nibbling their own flesh, their tongues pressing passionately. At the same time, each of their hands were groping the other's breasts. They rubbed, caressed, rubbed their asses with their hands and our bodies. Their lips and tongues were so wet that they moved one finger from one breast, and then the other to start moving up and down their body. Their cheeks were touching one another's, and their kisses could be heard from below. Their tongues were moving around, into one another's mouths.</p> <p>Neither of them knew what would happen next, but they both sensed it. Before they could take their mouths away, they pulled themselves closer, pressing their cocks tight against each other's asses, reaching back, rubbing and scratching to excite. Their hands and mouths were pressed against their crotches against one another's hands. And their cocks were now growing hard. Their hands and hands glided to the other's nipples. Their hips were moving together. Their cock's grew harder. Their cocks pressed against each other's bodies, and they moaned in unison. Their hands reached behind each other's heads to lift their mouths above and to kiss along their nipples, then their mouths, then their lips, and their cock heads moved along their bodies. Their lips moved together. Their hands moved up and around, to caress and stroke their partner's breasts, while their cocks were pushing against each other's bodies, rubbing their cocks together.</p> <p>They both felt the other's hands sliding across their asses to rub their breasts, while their cocks rubbed together. They touched their hands to their breasts to massage their nipples, and their legs, as well. Sometimes they rubbed their hands to touch their vaginas, and sometimes fingers to stroke their clitorises. Even through their pants, they could still feel their bodies getting hotter and hotter together, and their cocks pressed together. And they were both so glad they were doing the other, because they were both so thrilled by the other's touch, and they were loving it. They were so turned on by touching their bodies. Their cocks were hard as well. They were touching each other's back and their breasts. But their hands were holding other's waist and their hands were moving all over and making each other's cocks. They were rubbing together.</p> <p></p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
