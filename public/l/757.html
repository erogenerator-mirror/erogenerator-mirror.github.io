All her clothes had been lost in the dark.</p> <p>Sitting there in nothing more than a dark cloak, a single sheet of black cloth with several pages in it, Marion began feeling something in her. Someone was in her.</p> <p>A pair of strong hands began gently touching her everywhere. They took her down, holding her and guiding her back, pulling her upright to her knees, and gently kissing her feet. They began running their hands up and down her thighs. Another pair of strong hands took them down, and began rubbing her in the ass. It was so warm! She was so excited! And it made her wet!</p> <p>All at once, the warm hands began running all over her. A warm tongue began licking her inner thighs and running its way up to between her breasts. The soft lips that were so soft licked her nipples, and were sucking on them, and she began pushing her hips forward when they were being kissed, which caused the tongue to slide from side to side all the way up her stomach. A tongue that started going up and down her clit and into between her legs. A tongue that slid inside her pussy lips, licking her juices before sliding back down her wet pussy to her ass. The tip of the tongue was licking her asshole, which was sliding up towards her lips.</p> <p>It is true that the tongues did whatever they wanted to her without having been kissed or caressed before. Just one tongue was doing this for her. The other's tongue found her hole, sliding up her wet cunt before sliding back down to her pussy and back to the hard tongue between her legs. The tongue started sliding up and down her clit again, going from side to side, and making a sucking sound as it did so.</p> <p>Marion couldn't get the sensation through any of the movements which started from her clit, and her body was responding to the sensations. She couldn't get the sensation through the wetness between her legs, she couldn't get the sensation through the soft lips sliding up and down her cunt. She couldn't get this feeling out from between her thighs and through that wetness which she could imagine she could feel and have felt between her legs, which started a thousand times and were still only touching her.</p> <p>Marion closed her eyes and opened her mouth. She didn't want to breath. She was being fingered in the middle of the town. It had been so long, since any of her relatives had been there! She had seen her family for the last time during her visit, and she had seen their faces, just like their husbands and boyfriends. Their faces reminded her what she loved to remember. All of her relatives, the older one she had been with, seemed to have been her family. A family whose smiles and hugs never left her face, so long ago.</p> <p>Marion moaned quietly, as fingers inside her squeezed up hard against her clit, as the warm hands reached up to cup her tits and pinch her nipples and hold on to them. She felt like her whole body was being pushed up and down by the pleasure her pussy was receiving, the sensations from it to her brain to her senses, to be rubbed and massaged, by a pair of hands and tongue.</p> <p>What can she say? It feels so nice!</p> <p>The fingers began playing with her nipples. She was so excited at this point. When they finally came up to the point where a nipple slipped from the breast it could not go any further, the caressing fingers just squeezed her tit upwards and made it stick upwards towards the world the next time they went up and down her nipple. She started humping her hips, which were now going around in circles. They were moving all over the city in the moonlight, and it was only going to make things worse when the fingers started teasing her clit.</p> <p>When the fingers left her clit and went to where it wanted attention right over her opening, the fingers spread her cum out, which made the way of the finger between her wet lips easily enough. The finger slid in, and her body was responding to the finger inside her.</p> <p>She was so excited! The finger left her pussy and moved slowly and smoothly to her opening and rubbed it in a circular motion all around her opening while the finger continued fucking her while the finger started doing a circular motion too. God, her body felt so warm! Her moans got louder as she was getting a finger in her, with a finger that was stroking inside her clit's finger in and was working all around inside her pussy. The finger. She was so hot! Her body was alive! It was so good! It's so hot! This is happening! It feels so good. It's so good! I want it's so!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The finger slid it did it's itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
