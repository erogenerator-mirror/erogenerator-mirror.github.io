It was ... it was ... “I just want you inside me, just like I want you now,” he admits in some ragged voice, “I just want you inside me...I want you fucking me from behind...you’re driving me mad with need and need—I am so fucking hot now, and you're just getting wetter ... I love the way you take your pants off while we kiss - I’m dying to have you inside me...with me naked too—I’m dying to have you inside me...with all your hard hot cum spurting into my cunt—it’s like it’s a dream come true—I’m not like that; God it’s all so damned dirty...”</p> <p>"You like?" she asks, taking my hand in hers.</p> <p>"It's so good," I add, and we lock gazes.</p> <p>I think she is so incredibly beautiful, and she tells me so often that every little nuance in that moment and every moment of that moment will not seem like an eternity when we look at each other with unending adoration.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she continues, “that’s so good...I love your big fat cock...and I love your eyes on my naked naked body—I love your eyes on my sexy naked body...and I love everything about it...I love everything in my life...I love what you're doing and thinking...I love everything in my life...I’m fucking horny."</p> <p>"Mmm. Good thing I’m not your doctor's patient," I joke—a joke that is clearly more than a joke—though it makes me laugh, and I laugh all the harder.</p> <p>"You’re not mine—I just want you inside of me…oh God I want you inside of me."</p> <p>"You’re not?"</p> <p>"No, not at all...but you do have a good idea of how I want to be…and how I want to be..." Her smile widens to a smile that I can tell is genuine, and when she says it, I know that's the truth. It’m the truth.</p> <p>"I don't know...about…"</p> <p>"Oh?" she asks, drawing a fingertip in her mouth, tracing a path down my fingers. "You don't know what I want…do you?"</p> <p>I’m pretty sure the answer is yes or no. But I’m just an average little guy. I’m average and plain and average, and I don’t even have any special skills. I think I may be ordinary in some way. And I think that’s pretty common in the way that a lot of people are born with their sexuality. There are some things about being ordinary that you don’t know much about. Some things that are very very important in a healthy young soul. I never really knew why I thought there was a good reason that some men and women should never be together. It’s the way people have always told me that it is a sin to even think about what could be so special. I guess what I want to know about, and I don’t mean those things. I’m just someone who wants to live as a woman and go all the way with whatever's going on, regardless of what else is going on.</p> <p>"It’s true," she continues, and the moment that I’ve been waiting for has come.</p> <p>And it’s been worth waiting for.</p> <p>And then it is too late.</p> <p>I am so fucking horny—I’m not sure why, but at the moment that I’m even hornier than I can ever remember was ever going on.</p> <p>We make out slowly—it is a slow and sensual thing—and she pulls away just enough to get her hand between my legs. She is just so, absolutely so good at making me feel wanted, so sexy—I want nothing more than to keep fucking her...but something in my head has stopped me.</p> <p>"Can we go upstairs?" I say, looking at her face.</p> <p>"In a little bit."</p> <p>She nods. We're upstairs—and we’re fucking in a room of my old apartment.</p> <p>"Oh sweetheart—so sweet—so beautiful...it doesn't matter what you do—it doesn’t matter what you think. How are you do it or don’t. If we think it’re...I” she says, but her voice, “... not to me," and that and I know that all I start back on me. her face as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
