And as he did just that, he was on his knees, his tongue poking through the slit of the young man’s dick, he held a fist in each of his.</p> <p>He liked it. It was dirty, even dirty-dirty fucking. It was so much fun. A few cocks were in his hands. He liked it. But most of all his cock was stiffening. This particular thing about dicks was getting hard. He wanted the whole thing. He wanted to see them in his mouth. He wanted to suck off this beautiful, sweet man.</p> <p>He was horny and he was hard. But mostly it was about getting his dick sucked. His mind was reeling. It was a beautiful night. Darn! He was in Bezúkhov’s bed, and it felt like fucking time was right on and just a few short hours ago. It couldn’t all be a good dream, right? His cock was so hard and it was so hot and it was throbbing. Yes, good, that was good - good! - better still, how was his dick?</p> <p>He had his mouth on the pussy that had caused him to awaken. He felt it, he tasted it. His mouth and tongue had got to know the cunt so well over two hours ago. A taste of the pussy he had in mind made his cock hard. The feel of the lips, cunt around him. He wanted his dick. He wanted it in his mouth. But he was still in the living room, so he was more of a spectator.</p> <p>Darn! Darn! And he was still there. He couldn’t get out of there. Darn!</p> <p>Bzúkhov was now kneeling on the floor next to the bed. He had pulled a pillow down the way Darn was on it. He was kneeling in the air on all fours. His ass stuck up in the air. And his dick was standing up in the air, stiff as steel. He wanted Darn big. Not just for a blow job, but a fucking. In his mind he saw the look on Darn’s face. There was just such a look, just like when the old, old count called him dirty. Oh, fuck! A cock in his mouth. And he could feel his own ass cheeks, spread apart just enough to get him a little bit of that nice hard cock as it was so hard and jutting up at him.</p> <p>He felt it, he felt Darn’s dick right above his lips. That's it. It had gone that way in a flash. Right there in the warm, sweet-scented air. His cock was in the mouth of this old man again. He wanted his cock... it was in his mouth. His lips were touching the hard flesh. He could feel it. He had to. Oh fuck. A cock was right there in his mouth. It wasn’t a dream, this was something else. He wanted the cock. He wanted it in his mouth. His ass cheeks were open out, and he couldn’t even tell if it belonged to this old stranger. He wanted the cock in his mouth, and this was a cock in my mouth. This was someone more experienced. Not the old guy. Darn did not want to be the man he thought he was, but he couldn’t have stopped himself if he wanted too.</p> <p>He wanted a hard, stiff cock in his hand, not just one that liked it. Fuck! This was a long night. Darn didn’t know if he wouldn’t come. He didn’t know how this dick could ever be as hard as he wanted it. Couldn’t it be just too rough? He just wanted it. He didn’t want it any harder. It was too hard, and he knew, just maybe, he could just try it. But the way it was throbbing there, it wasn’t working to move. It had found its mark somewhere, and it just wanted to be rubbed. Darn was there all right. Oh fuck! He was stroking his own cock and it was getting hot again.</p> <p>I want more. It’s your mouth. Do it, man. I want your mouth on me again. Do whatever you want. But don’t do it with your ass. Don’t be a whore. That’s just your dick, that’s all of my, I swear. Don”</p> <p></p> <p>But he can’t he, he, or what? This thing? His dick? He doesn’s there, oh yes, it, but Darn, yes yes, oh yes, yes, yes, yes a cock—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
