G. Wells </h3><h4>THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT.</h4><p><strong>The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian might see down upon us behind our</strong> backs as we rose from the roof of the ship. We were no longer aware of anything, except for the noise of the fighting that ensued. The ship had just reached it's highest point, and we began to make haste to move off.</p> <p>We approached another ship on the other side of that point, and saw what had happened.</p> <p>SILENCE</p> <p>That was when you could see for the first time on the ship. I saw the light of the sun on the planet's horizon as the sun reached its apex. The ship, its surface was rocky, but it was as tall as it was wide, so that every time I was in it I could even make out the shape of the earth's sun. It was like a dream. I began to marvel that the ship seemed to be alive. The lights, and shadows, shone down upon the ship.</p> <p>I was awestruck with my awe, and thought that I felt a little like a young boy, or some kind of woman, and suddenly my eyes opened and I saw I was alone with a beautiful creature. I was amazed that my eyes were not as dilated as my brain. She was beautiful, as beautiful a woman as I had ever seen. She had long dark hair, and soft brown eyes. She was slim and petite, about 5'8", and was about 5'9", without a hair on her body. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. Her long, blonde hair spread down her shoulders, and hung down her back in beautiful locks. Her full breasts were just above the water line in a tiny way. I just stood there watching the shape of her body, as she spoke to me.</p> <p>"Come back inside."</p> <p>I was dumbfounded. I was standing in a beautiful alien creature that I have never seen before. Now I was seeing her full and lovely naked. She was not a female, only a full and voluptuous one. She walked over to me, and began to unbutton my shirt. She slowly unbuttoned it and slipped it off my body until my body was totally nude. She was so light and soft, with her big soft breasts and smooth skin. She was beautiful, I thought. I took my shirt off with trembling hands, taking the weight of her body as if weighed in it. Then my shirt came off, and I was naked. Her mouth engulfed my cock, and that feeling I had experienced before was like nothing I had ever felt before. Her mouth was so warm and soft. She began to lick and suck me, as her hands worked my body. It went on like that for several minutes.</p> <p>"Lick me, fuck me, fuck me hard, fuck me now."</p> <p>It was a language that had been a secret for me, when I was at college. I had never spoken such language, but in that context it was just as sexual as anything that I had ever heard.</p> <p>She moved over to her bed, and sat down on it. My cock seemed to twitch inside her. I was about to fall asleep, when she pushed me on it, saying, "I want you to fuck me, fuck me hard. You are not going to fall asleep unless you fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me fuck me fuck me I want your big cock inside me."</p> <p>I thought that I could hold out another hour or so before I fell asleep, but then I woke up. I was naked, just as I had always been. I could not find my pants, as the ship was a huge ship, and had to climb the walls and then crash into the hull. I was exhausted, and was wondering why I had gone to sleep naked, and not dressed. Her mouth and hands had been everywhere, and I thought I heard some muffled grunts as she ate up my cock. I felt a lot better, and became aware of where I was lying. I did not know where I was, at first, until I looked at the stars, and then I looked at her. I fell to the floor in shock.</p> <p>Her skin was so soft. She had no hair on her body, for she had hair there that I had never seen in my life. She was beautiful.</p> <p>"You fell asleep, like that, didn't you? You should have slept in here with me. I am not that kind of gal."</p> <p>She put her finger on my lips and told me to be quiet and to be gentle. "I did not fall asleep, and I woke you up while I was in your body, naked, and I can see you still like this. You are still alive. And that's what happens when you go to sex. This way out there. You go and stay there." She put her finger on my lips again and turned to my face again, and kissed my cock. "If you like this is your bodyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
