While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver’s history was enveloped,</strong> the knowledge alone would do her in. She was too excited.</p> <p>She'd been trying for a long time to make a decision on the subject; she wanted an answer. The answer was, the answers would always be the same for everyone. But, in her current predicament, there was never a choice.</p> <p>It was no one.</p> <p>"Oliver," she called, and he stood. "Come on," she pleaded again. It was a little unnerving. She had made that connection once before and it had always been there. She would be doing the right thing.</p> <p>Oliver entered to her, with the other students in the class taking note of him. She felt a little bit of heat rush to her face. "No, Oliver. We're already done."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah?" Oliver's question was a little bit uncertain, and he was in his element to help get her alone. The situation had been bad. He knew that she felt as anxious as ever, and his confidence was making this even better.</p> <p>"Yeah," she replied. "It didn't make any difference if it didn't. You know that you'll get to use my ass sooner than later." She knew, but she was getting more and more anxious.</p> <p>She made Oliver wait while she turned and pulled up her skirt to slide her tight leather pants down her legs and off. She felt his eyes staring at her pantied pussy. The little bit of cloth separating the lips made her feel so sexy. It was just like when she was a virgin. She knew that this experience was not a new experience, but what it would be like to feel that same sensation in herself. That wetness between her legs. To feel how her skin quivered as she slid the leather pants over her legs.</p> <p>"It'd probably be even more fun if you fucked my ass, Oliver," she said, as if reading his mind. That had certainly crossed Oliver's face. "But, you've got to be patient, because I just might regret it," she added with a slight smile. "It's been too long, Oliver." Her voice felt as innocent about this as it did when she was around his age. Maybe it was just nerves. Maybe it was how she was dressed.</p> <p>"Don't worry," he replied. "I mean, come to think of it, it's only a matter of time before you're a virgin." The truth of Oliver's point made his heart sink. He had thought of, not only taking his virginity, but giving it to someone who was not his first. But, she was right when she said she was already a virgin, too. She was just a girl of 21.</p> <p>She quickly finished removing her clothes before Oliver got the chance to say another word. That part Oliver did agree with. And he did understand. He knew exactly what he had to do to complete his goal. She'd already gone through the process. He didn't have to choose to. He didn't have to decide if he should be proud to tell her all the intimate details about what she had to do. He didn't have to choose between her sweet body and his hard cock.</p> <p>But, there was no choice. He wasn't here to make that decision. He was at the mercy of the one person who would be his first. His mother. For who knew how long it would be since he'd made his decision. What a strange day!</p> <p>He was in his room. His pants, underwear, shoes, and socks were strewn across the floor. The walls of his room were lined with his own clothes, scattered across the room. She had her skirt and panties still on and she was now bent over his bed while he stripped his pants off. She was lying there, on top of him, feeling his hard length pressed up against her pussy, and he was already at about the same level of excitement as she.</p> <p>Oliver wanted to do this. He wanted to touch and pull her body, to see her naked body, to give himself to her, to own her. He wanted to do something. He knew what he wanted to do. But, he knew that he couldn't just do her for free. That would cost her forever. Or at least, that's what her pussy wanted. If she was willing to let him fuck it up, then he would take it from her.</p> <p>As he lay on top of her, his penis was just a bit shorter than his pants felt through them. Even just rubbing up against her, there was no way he was going to get his penis inside those panties. He only had to think of her as his own mother, his own. the woman. Or even. As if it meant he would have to give her a chance. He would be able to claim her body, he felt his own. He would claim she belonged, to hold on—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
