I quite love that dear Dr. Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He</strong> always seems to find something to do or something to write about. I bet you a fair price he'd really need a guide to writing about things. He has some neat stories too, though I'd really like to read a little bit, too. Especially this one if he likes it.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"You're not really going to answer that one?" I asked as Lucy got off the couch.</p> <p>"Of course I am. I just want to know if this is what she gets for Christmas." Lucy was leaning over on the couch with me. She had her hands on her knees, her chin tilted up so I could look between her gorgeous breasts. I looked up at her, smiling to see the excitement that was on her face while we looked into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"You get whatever gifts that you need for your special Christmas." I said, taking a step toward her. "I just want something you've really been looking forward to." My hands began to work on the buttons on her blouse.</p> <p>"So, you'll be glad you did." Lucy grinned at me. I could tell that this was her favorite part of the holiday, so we were all going to be excited.</p> <p>"I sure hope so, as usual." I laughed and pushed my way back through her buttons. She was wearing a strapless bra, which showed even more of her breasts, but also made her nipples clearly visible.</p> <p>"So many good Christmas gifts lately, and I just want to see the new things to share." Lucy took a step toward me. "This just isn't fair."</p> <p>"We've all been so nice to you before."</p> <p>"Of course." Her hand was on the button on my jeans. "You can't wait for your surprise when you get home."</p> <p>"Of course I can. What time does he leave, and can he come early." I couldn't believe what he actually said.</p> <p>"He is still at dinner." She looked confused.</p> <p>"Don't worry. It's my last day before I leave and he leaves on Tuesday, so..." I pushed my jeans down to my ankles and then kicked them away. Lucy had stopped to look, just before I could remove them, then I dropped them, leaving my boxer shorts on the couch. I couldn't believe that she had noticed my growing erection before I left the house. I was so excited that I nearly fell at that moment. Lucy grinned at me when I caught her looking at my boxers, which was obviously a huge hit for her. She was grinning ear to ear. She got up to step back then, but before she got more than a step forward I quickly took hold of her hair and grabbed it, holding it in one hand, pushing her down to her knees, then my body and my cock.</p> <p>I could feel Lucy's eyes on me as I slid in her mouth. "Oh fuck."</p> <p>"Do me again, Lucy." It was just like the moment on the video earlier. The moment that made me come first. Then the moment that I was thinking about doing when the music started. I didn't want to miss it. Lucy was my best friend for all of us but I wanted things to be better, so I took it as a sign that I wanted. We never fucked this time, but Lucy just seemed to enjoy the taste of my semen after I came. I had never tasted such a delicious cum. It turned out that a few hours earlier I had been imagining this experience while masturbating. The thought of her and me in the shower washing each other. The way my hands slid over her body and into her ass. The way I fingered her until she came.</p> <p>Once I was done, I stood up so that she could pull herself off my cock without taking her mouth off of it. I stood there with Lucy's mouth still on my cock, her eyes looking up at me while she smiled and swallowed another load of my semen.</p> <p>"That was awesome." Lucy said. "But I'm not done." Her hand reached out and grasped my cock. "Now what do you want, Mr. Van Helsing?"</p> <p>"I want my gift," I smiled. "Not to just your mouth. I want to kiss you. With your whole body pressed tightly against me."</p> <p>Lucy smiled and looked down and then up at me. "I know. This was kind of sudden, I know." She leaned in, her breasts rubbing against my chest. I could feel her nipples pressing into me. I could feel her breasts in my stomach. I could feel her body.</p> <p>"We need each other's hands here while you're here".</p> <p></p> <p>"We're..." "</p> <p>"And we are the other's..." right." she wants." I want you want you..." ?" " you...""..." ?"</p> <p>we—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
