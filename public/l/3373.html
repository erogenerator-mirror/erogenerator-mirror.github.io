Well, for now. For the moment he should be the one with the camera on, Penelope thought. For the time she was a teacher, she had already been a model for his art form since before she even knew what they were. They were her little secret. She wanted to believe him. But, that was impossible to say. He could be the worst actor she'd ever laid her hands on. And he'd probably be her boyfriend. It wasn't even a date.</p> <p>As Penelope thought about the last few weeks. She had already planned on telling her boyfriend about the party she got up the courage to go to. She hadn't even told him about the party she attended. He'd assumed she was a virgin after having fooled around with boys her age. It was only when she showed her little shyness during the time she had been a virgin that she realized she didn't want to just be a virgin.</p> <p>She had been drunk.</p> <p>And now he was having sex with her. And he was going to do it again and again and again in front of her friends. If she didn't want to get caught, she probably wouldn't be having sex with him. But she was drunk, so she wouldn't be having sex with him.</p> <p>Yes, this was Penelope Montgomery.</p> <p>The girl had been a popular science fiction author, but she had never dreamed of having sex before. Now, Penelope Montgomery was doing it at school, which included having sex with men in every sort of way imaginable.</p> <p>The only thing Penelope liked more than being on a date with a handsome man was being on a date with him. She loved the way his lips and tongue felt against hers. When he'd take her somewhere and they'd get naked together, she was sure that would feel even better than at the party. And she knew that when they were going to actually have sex, then they might be able to feel the pleasure between them.</p> <p>Pencape had been the last name of the school for Penelope Montgomery. A new science fiction publisher was hiring to fill her accounting position at the new science fiction publishing house. Now, as a science fiction writer, she enjoyed the new job, and the new career. She was starting Monday.</p> <p>Pencape Montgomery had to be the only one of her students.</p> <p>*** Chapter 14</p> <p>Penelope Montgomery woke up. She stretched her body to one side, her back against her window, her eyes still closed, and realized the morning breeze could be heard over her window. She hadn't been awake long enough to notice the sound of birds scurrying outside.</p> <p>"Morning dear, how'd you sleep," Mrs. Montgomery asked.</p> <p>"I had a good rest," Penelope said, as she stretched. Looking over at the clock next to the alarm clock on her dresser, she was still surprised to realize where she was. She had been so tired when she woke up.</p> <p>"Well," She said, taking a few moments to recall what she'd been doing the night before, "I guess I'm going to have to go to classes. I was hoping to see the teacher's chair again. Good thing it's pretty late."</p> <p>"Yeah, it must be. It's not a day off," she said, smiling when she noticed her panties still covering her crotch from the light breeze. "Well, I'm ready to go now. I'm going to make myself breakfast in bed."</p> <p>"I need a shower," Penelope said, moving back to her room and then to her bed. "Do you know what I think it would do me to have a long hot shower anyway?"</p> <p>No sooner than she got dressed, then there was knock on her door.</p> <p>She opened up the door almost in shock, not expecting to hear the door, but seeing the handsome face of Professor Anthony Lattimore standing there inside her bedroom.</p> <p>"Oh, I...I'm sorry," Penelope said, pulling her legs and dress up and out, covering her nude body while smiling at him. Then, she looked at the clock. It was still after 2am.</p> <p>"I'm afraid I'd be surprised if you did," Anthony said as he stepped inside her bedroom.</p> <p>"Sorry," Penelope said as she sat down at her big bedside table and looked at the clock. "I'm sorry." She didn't know what her mistake was, but she was worried.</p> <p>"Well, I'm sorry. I need a shower. I'll...uh," Anthony. I mean. sure," Anthony said.</p> <p></p> <p>"Uhm." Penelope nodded.</p> <p>"I...uh," said Anthony came with that. she looked over here. and then she said.</p> <p>with a little smile.</p> <p>" I," "h," she said. smiled—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
