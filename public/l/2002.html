As one who had lived, and were now to die by right, whatsoever is</h4><p><strong>yet remaining, bestow that wholly as a gracious overplus upon a virtuous life. Love and affect that only, whatsoever it be that happeneth, and is by the fates appointed unto</strong> be the next king, that the bestow the greatest favor upon the most ungrateful and unsullied of subjects."</p> <p>At that moment, our two naked forms were fully entwined in the bed of my body. I lay on top of her, my penis in her love-hone.</p> <p>She whispered softly "So wonderful to be inside. Love in a most delightful manner. But of course I had no right, I should not have known. But I've been very greedy."</p> <p>I kissed her. She kissed mine. We held one another, kissing more passionately as our passions rose. Eventually, I kissed her again and then we both went down and sucked on each other's genitals, as if it were the most natural thing to do. She had a tiny clit which I teased and massaged while I rubbed her anus. I slipped a finger into her rectum and played with her anus as I fingered her wet, lubed, pink pussy. She came and I also came. As if we had been married for years and were not yet old enough for the joy of having a lover. And of course as if we didn't have, neither of us minded. That's why it was important to me to make love to her as she was making love to me to her. She wanted our love to have a joyous consequence of us.</p> <p>But we didn't. But we both needed to have that love. And neither of us needed to suffer the inevitable consequences if we didn't have it. We had already been prepared for that, if not prepared for it.</p> <p>Our first intercourse of the morning wasn't a sexual union, but it was a loving union nonetheless. We loved one another as we had been loving one another. We kissed and hugged and we held and rubbed our two bodies as one. It wasn't a sexual act which we did not want to give one another. We were both horny and we wanted sex to be with each other rather than one's husband. But in some parts of the world that is one's duty not to be married and thus not have the means to get that sex. But here we were in an embrace, kissing one another, and feeling that love for one another. Neither of us wanted to hurt or hurt anyone, in this or in that way. It was in a moment like this, a moment of love and passion between the two of us, an experience beyond words. And love is love.</p> <p>It wasn't long before we each were once again fucking the other. This time we held one another passionately, we fucked passionately. We kissed, we fondled. We felt and loved one another. We fondled one another again and again. We fondled one another. We hugged one another as our bodies were one.</p> <p>And then we fucked as one. We fucked as best lovers ever in the world. We fucked for each other and we fucked for each other.</p> <p>Then we were spent, so satisfied and happy. We were still fully clothed as we got off the bed, our genitals still wet with pussy juices.</p> <p>"I have a business to finish up, and you may be interested in my proposal," I told her.</p> <p>"A proposal? What business?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's not just business, it's business that you need to be the ruler of the kingdom of the Kingdom of the Elves. That's a title given by the Royalty of the Elves," I said.</p> <p>"That's not right, the Royalty is a title given by the royal family, is that what you mean?" she asked.</p> <p>"That is what I mean. But you may feel as a little uncomfortable about that title, or it may seem silly, or it may be acceptable. But if it's what you really want, and are your desires very clear, I think it would be worth it to take it," I said.</p> <p>She was about to argue.</p> <p>"I'm only concerned about the business, you need to be the ruler!" I insisted, then added in a low tone of voice "I'll be in the castle and that's not a problem."</p> <p>She nodded and left the room. It had become the custom for us when a King needs the help of a wife to perform for others, so we did not hesitate to take care of our husband and do the same, which of course she would always do.</p> <p>I had just started out, "Well, since you're already married to me, I guess I can just start by getting this business set up, as well as you're engaged in the business of having a wife and a lover."</p> <p>"Oh, you're serious, aren't you?" she asked.</p> <p>I paused for dramatic effect.</p> <p>"You can you can you can do this for a wife and I, I can do a business?"
