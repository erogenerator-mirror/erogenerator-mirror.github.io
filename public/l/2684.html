The Law of Nature, and the Civill Law, contain each other, and are of equall extent. For the Lawes of Nature, which consist in Equity, Justice, Gratitude, and other</strong> such basic foundations, they are of no substance. For the Laws of Nature are a metaphysical foundation that provides the foundation for the Philosophy ofNature. This is because of the balance of the Law. If a Law can be explained, and the balance of the law has the right to exist for another, so is the Philosophy ofNature. If the Law is not a metaphysical foundation at all, and the balance of the Law has the right to exist for another, then the Philosophy of Nature, also known as Ethics, is of no substance. This is because the Law of Nature should always be of interest.</p> <p>"So. Now. You are about to get fucked. I want you in the bed. " He said in all seriousness, and took her arm. He pulled her naked body down on to the bed, her back to his chest, her thighs spread wide and she felt his cock press against her. His right hand grasped her left leg and slowly spread it, bending her leg over his own, his hand still on her leg, and he started pushing his now rigid cock into her. She was completely wet and wet. He pushed it into her, and then pulled out again. Then he started again, and then back in. He had her pussy so swollen that it was almost painful to him, but she was so aroused and sensitive that after a few moments she couldn't bear any more.</p> <p>He held her body close with his cock still buried deep inside her, and his hand slowly moved up her thigh, touching her soft pussy lips as the skin of his fingers separated her lips, and then slowly began stroking her clit until she moaned and her hips rose up to meet his hand. He moved his hand up, but as soon as her lips separated, his fingers plunged into her cunt, and he pulled out his fingers, wet with her juices, and smeared them over her clit. She exploded on the bed and nearly tore his cock off. He could still see her breasts hanging down the bed. He was rock hard again. He put his hand around his cock, as hard as he could squeeze it, to hold it still.</p> <p>He lay on top of her with his hand moving up and down her slippery body. He started to kiss her, with her tongue in his mouth. His other hand was playing with her tit and her clit as his cock slowly and slowly made its way out and back into her wet channel. He stopped kissing her mouth and started to kiss her neck, her shoulders, and then her breasts. Up to her chin, then her eyes, then her mouth, her nose, her ears. He took her right nipple, one of its own, and sucked it. She gasped when he did that again, and he pressed his nipple down harder. She held his hand tight on her breast, and pressed her thigh down on his hip so that his rigid cock was pressing into her pussy, and his hand was rubbing her clit.</p> <p>"Now. Put it in me. I want it in me now ...now. Come on, now please. Fuck me. Fuck me hard!" she begged.</p> <p>He rolled over again and she straddled him again on her back. He rolled over on top of her. He positioned himself under her and positioned his own body between her thighs again, as he held his cock pointing down at her. Her pussy was open and waiting. He rubbed her clit gently as he pressed his cock against her opening, and pushed in just slightly with his fingers. She was wet to his touch, and he could just slide in and out very easily. He pressed the tip of his cock into her opening, then slid his shaft out of her. He repeated this, sliding his cock into her, once more in, out, and then back in. He could feel her body tightening beneath him and she reached behind herself and started to stroke his cock, holding him out as long as she knew how, and then suddenly he was inside her. She squeezed his cock with her pussy around it tightly. They both felt the ecstasy of their being connected, then of each other. He felt her hot wet channel wrap tightly around his cock as his lips met hers. She squeezed him tight with her vagina around his cock. She could feel him pushing it into her, and the tension deep in her pussy made her whole body tingle.</p> <p>"Yes! Right there! Yes. Now. Like that ...hard. Right there. Now" she gasped. This sent him over the edge. So intense! He could see she was getting into it with him, but then he felt her body tighten around him, and that familiar tingle, then he was thrusting himself into her as she pulled him tight and could feel her. She had tightened around him, his cock inside her and he could feel her cunt around his cock as his cock inside her, and her pussy wrapped around his hands. As she squeezed him as he could feel herself, he reachedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
