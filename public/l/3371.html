Ulysses was left in the cloister, pondering</strong> what to do next when an idea arose in his head. "Hey, is this about all of our problems being explained in English? I think I'm going to need a nap."</p> <p>Wily, he picked up his spectacles and set them on the table. "Good night, Ms. Clarke."</p> <p>He walked to the door again, this time placing his spectacles on the table before he started his walk to the door. Then he stopped. The hall way was dark. "What the hell?" he asked himself. He walked again. Now came the hallway.</p> <p>"How dare I have a snore at a school in the middle of the day," he thought to himself again. He stopped at the top of the doorway to the hallway as he felt his breathing begin to come out of him. Then he reached the bottom of the hallway and found a warm body beside him, her hand resting on his hard-on. "Oh, damn. I'm dead. I've lost it a good thirty-eight hours ago, before I even knew it. That's just one way to go," Michael thought to himself. It was like she knew he was dead. She was just too damn good of a piece of ass to miss out on. And I have her name... He felt himself lose it again.</p> <p>"Oh, my....um....this is my room," Michael stammered out incoherently as his cock started to harden in his pants. She noticed it. His eyes immediately dropped to her breasts. "This is my bathroom," he explained. He felt like, as if he had lost himself in the sweet bliss of it all. The thought of her naked, dripping and ready for him....God, what a turn on I got here.... His heart beat doubled. "No....wait....oh, stop..." he moaned out. "No. I just have another headache and I want to take a walk," he pleaded. However, he did not want to lose control of her. "Come on, I don't care," he said weakly. She nodded emphatically. She stood to the side of him, as if waiting to do so. "And so do I."</p> <p>She walked around behind him. Michael could feel his hands slipping down her back, up her dress, to her firm, round buttocks, then back again. "Oh, yes....yes....yes. Just like that," he whispered to himself as her soft, warm body pressed against his.</p> <p>He closed his eyes, as if the world was in front of him for the first time. His mind was just clouded in a sea of pleasure as she wrapped her soft hands around his head and gently pressed him down into her. As if in answer, he knew he had to get control of himself and get this far. He closed his eyes and took deep breaths to relax. Then he opened them again. Her lips were just inches away from his and he knew she was ready and willing for him.</p> <p>He moved his lips down her neck, and then down to her shoulders. "Is this what you want," he whispered to himself in delight. He moved down to her breasts, kissing each one in turn as her body trembled and trembled.</p> <p>They were soft and yet firm and delicious. The skin of her nipples was smooth and warm and he began to play with them, gently pulling them away from her body as he slid his mouth onto them, latching his lips around them and suckling them in his mouth as he gently pumped up her legs with his hand, kissing them as his fingers explored her hot, wet pussy. She moaned under his touch, as he lanced his tongue repeatedly around and around her stiff nub, and then up to it, driving her crazy. Then...He moved his mouth down her body, latching his tongue to the bottom of her breasts, sucking at, licking over her nipples, sucking them in his mouth. She groaned under his touch, as he began to work her with his mouth—tongue around her nipple, suckling her breasts and licking her nipples with his tongue. He pulled the nub from his mouth and flicked the tip of it with his tongue before he plunged his hot mouth into her pussy.</p> <p>She threw her head back, arching her back and arching her hips as his tongue danced down her quivering body. Then she raised her legs to rest upon the chair's chair arms, and with her feet flat against the back and, as he moved lower and.</p> <p></p> <p>he moved down her to her hips. he lowered himself on. as he, kissing her body.
