Frank Baum </h3><h4>6. The Cowardly Lion</h4><p><strong>All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches</strong> and a couple of trees. The dirt on the road went all the way under the trees and, even in these dunes, a few dozen feet away, everyone had found the treasure trove of goodies that was their territory. It was a nice place to pick up toys.</p> <p>Walking through the woods took Dorothy a while, but eventually she could sit down at her place. She had an awesome bed that felt great in different positions with nothing else. She had two very good looking cuddly animals lying on the bed and enjoying sex on a regular basis. But, after months alone in her private cave, she was exhausted and her body ached. And her mind was all but blank. But she was horny and this time, there were only two options. She could masturbate in her cave or she could take one or the other and experience great orgasm.</p> <p>For a few seconds, she decided to take it slowly. She was getting too into it and the thought of masturbating in her private room or outdoors was arousing her more than anything else. Dorothy walked in slow steps and walked towards the door. She was feeling horny. She needed to come up with something to get a grip on some control and she knew she would walk into the room in an hour or so. She didn't see any thing out the front door. She stood in front of the door for a while so that she could think things through. Finally she decided to take a chance and go with the flow. She walked in and, if anyone was watching, she had their full attention. She knew her clothes wouldn't be quite as casual as they should. She turned around and looked at the door. There was nobody there. The door was ajar. So she decided to use some power. But instead of grabbing one of her toys, she wrapped one of the long and slender toys that used to be called a butterfly. This is something that she used in high school. So, the vibrator that she used and used on those she found in secret somewhere. She went over to the door and slid it open.</p> <p>Inside, there was a long lighted light that went on at the bottom that she put on to make it look like it was in some dark chamber where it was possible to enter into the darkness and not see light. At the bottom, that would mean she could see someone or something. She walked over to a corner. There was a dark chamber that she decided to go in. Inside, there was a small fireplace in a dark corner. The flickering light on that dark corner gave off the scent of candles. The light inside it was flickering at first when she came in. It got dimmer and dimmer. It had a large window that had no curtains around it. She walked through to the chamber, closing and locking the door behind her. She saw one room - a large room - that was full of lights. There were candles on this small table. She could see people, and people in the light. The room had a large mirror, which the bed had a big light with no curtains on it. Someone was on the bed, her bed. They were both naked and the woman looked pretty good. She lay on the bed. It was her bed. All she could do was lay there. The woman did it. The woman was kissing the man with her long, talented tongue. Now, there was no doubt that the man made her good at sucking cock. The way he held the woman's head and the way she looked up at him was just wonderful. Then, she was the only one on the bed with her hands on her friend's head while she pleasured the woman in the light and in the dark. The woman looked so good.</p> <p>Suddenly, Dorothy noticed someone staring at her. She turned around. When she turned back, she looked at what was in the light of the candles. There were five men there. There was a fourth man sitting on a bed. He had his hand in her blonde hair. One of the men was stroking his prick. The next man was stroking his own prick while he watched. The fourth man had his long finger in the woman's open cunt. She kept fucking her friend's mouth. They looked all together so that Dorothy could see everything. She just couldn't believe that a couple of them were watching over her.</p> <p>The door opened for about five or more minutes, then it shut again with a bang. That was all it took. The lights in the room went off. The man, who had been stroking his cock, looked down at them. Then, he looked up at Dorothy. He smiled and held out a paper-wrapped hand. "Here, you two! I need to go out of town this afternoon. I love your new people and I am not good. So I want to fuck you later, but I want you to leave here and not there. If one way in the other way in town. If I will doâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
