The Examination</h4><p><strong>No sooner had Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in spite</strong> of having fucked a beautiful woman who was to my right, I was having my wicked thoughts about how much I would rather get fucked every time.</p> <p>"Villefort, I'm a man with a problem," I said, as I held onto the countertop with one of Villefort's slender hands.</p> <p>"Hmmm," Villefort's gaze met mine, as he continued, "a problem? It's no problem." He took a gander as if he was admiring my body.</p> <p>"Nervous because of what?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, no," Villefort smiled. "It's all nerves, and it feels good. You're my first and I'm not going to rush you."</p> <p>I could not believe how good this was looking; I had not seen it at any time in our lives. My fingers touched it and it felt warm. I pulled off what was left of my bikini top. "Well, it's not a bikini either," I said, reaching for a bottle of vodka and an empty beer bottle.</p> <p>He took the bottle from me, and he took the beer bottle. He took the beers bottle out of my hand and placed the bottle between his outstretched fingers. I took a sip before looking him in the eye and saying, "There's nothing better than vodka," while I held onto the beer bottle to my stomach.</p> <p>"I believe," Villefort smiled like a devil and began pulling on my bikini bottom, as he looked me in the eye. He pulled my bottom down to my knees, and his hand slipped under my cheeks, to touch my asshole.</p> <p>He turned me to look at myself in the mirror, and I saw as if an invisible hand of a hand began to caress under my chin, down to my neck before coming back up to my face. The sensation was exquisite, and I longed to touch him, but the moment had passed. Instead, Villefort opened the wine bottle, opened a can of beer, poured a little glass down to me, opened a beer bottle, poured himself a little more, and poured the beer down to me. When he did this, some of the alcohol went down to my pussy, and I could feel myself get wet already.</p> <p>"This is so good," Villefort exclaimed, as my legs went weak and I gasped.</p> <p>"It sure is," I nodded.</p> <p>"This is my first time," he continued. "It feels so fucking good being your first." His hands were on my waist, and his face was inches away from my stomach. I could feel his breath on my skin.</p> <p>Suddenly, when my face was covered in wine-colored wine, the sight of a hot-bodied blond woman turned my head sharply until I could see a pair of beautiful blue eyes, staring down at my breasts through half-closed slits.</p> <p>"My, my,," I said, leaning towards him. I tried to be discreet so I wouldn't seem to have an effect while staring at him, but my eyes kept darting from his eyes to look at his mouth, to his lower lip.</p> <p>"Villefort, you're the first lover I've ever had," I gushed, as my legs began to tremble, my breathing hard.</p> <p>"You're gorgeous," he smiled. "My first one though; the first guy who ever has." He brought his right hand around to my shoulder and slipped the beer bottle out of my hand.</p> <p>"Villefort!" I gasped. "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"I want to do something that's totally out of the blue for you...but you're not my first one," he said.</p> <p>"You're my first," I repeated, as I slowly turned around in shock.</p> <p>He looked at me in the eye, and asked, "I'm the first one to have you?"</p> <p>"I'm very experienced," I confessed, as my fingers touched him on their way from my lips to his stomach.</p> <p>"You're very experienced," he laughed.</p> <p>I pulled my hand to my mouth to cover any taste of any of the wine he had drunk from my hands, so I could lick my fingers clean. Then, I kissed his stomach, just below his navel, before standing up.</p> <p>"Villefort, we were in the middle of the store," I said. "Let's go out."</p> <p>"What for?" "Well, I thought maybe the wine got you hot again," I said. I was standing still but leaning up against his chest. "It's a woman's about time."</p> <p>"Wait," he said I, "we just got in front to be a little hot." He brought one hand around to feel me.</p> <p>He started massaging my breasts, he felt my ass.
