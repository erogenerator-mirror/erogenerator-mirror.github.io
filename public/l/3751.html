BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS</h4><p><strong>The night was bitter cold. The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were</strong> there.</p> <p>For what felt like an eternity, for two hours, time passed, and there was a quiet sound of wind that was barely audible. His eyelids drooped over the edge of their covers and he found he was able to slip out of an embrace with a sigh.</p> <p>There was another silence, another breath, another smile and a few moments of awkward silence. But before he could open his eyes again, the warm touch of the wind reached out from behind. A gust of gust of misty air blew on his face.</p> <p>"Sorry." A voice with a deep low sexy voice whispered into his ear.</p> <p>The voice felt so alive and it sent a shiver through him. "Sorry." As he said it she took his mind and left it and went to sleep. The dream felt so comforting in his sleep and he had so much more to say. A few moments later they were going to have sex and he was going to fuck her. "What were you thinking?" His mouth gaped open while he stared at the screen.</p> <p>'That was nice.' His imagination took advantage of a dreamy moment.</p> <p>Chapter Eight: "What happens with us?" The question was clear to him in the way that it was meant to be. She was naked, his pants were gone and she was getting him inside of her. His hands were holding on to her breasts while she was sliding up and down on top of him, and the whole scene was so sensual that he felt his mind wandering. Every ounce of pleasure he had was being released on that screen. Even the act of feeling that her ass would grind against his thighs made sense and it was so good to be with her. It was so easy to fall in love with her. She was so sexy and he was so good at being nice to her.</p> <p>'You're so sweet! How are you and that little witch?' And that's all he had time to say before she was sliding up and down and he was holding onto her waist with his right hand, his left hand making circles around her hips. In the darkness as they were moving, in the dark, they couldn't see anything. The way she was moving, the light that had been reflecting at the camera, and then it slipped out of the camera.</p> <p>"How did I ever get along with you, with this... video? This is so... different."</p> <p>"A whole lot different.'</p> <p>'A whole lot different.' A very strange voice echoed in his mind.</p> <p>'Tell me, what do you think?' The thought and the feeling was electric to him.</p> <p>'I'll tell you. I do love you.'</p> <p>'And I love you.'</p> <p>'And all you're thinking about is her... is her butt on top of your thighs, her breasts pushing into you. That's nothing to be worrying about. Just let go. If she's not a witch, I'll just... forget about it.' The thought made sense to him.</p> <p>'Maybe I should.' His eyes closed and he heard the voice in his mind tell him he was falling in love with her. It didn't mean anything. And it didn't mean what he thought it meant. 'I love you.' "Fuck me." His hands pulled on her hip, causing her to slide further down, her left leg wrapping around his right thigh. Her lips glided up and down the shaft that she had taken from above. "Fuck me, baby."</p> <p>"You really are so sweet." His lips slid down the side of her neck while his hands found her breasts and she started moving her hips faster on him. "I love you so much. More than I have ever loved anyone." His thumb was pinching and pulling the nipple of her left breast when he felt it, her entire body quivering and the heat from it spread throughout the room, radiating out from her body. She closed her eyes and felt her own body trembling, her fingers grabbing tight onto his thigh as he moved in and out of her. "I love you." All thoughts vanished except the sound that was escaping his head from the sound that was being drowned out.</p> <p>"I love you too." But not as much as he loved her.</p> <p>She squeezed her eyes shut and her arms fell onto his shoulders. "I love you." Her lips moved up until he felt her tongue licking and dancing against his lips. "I love you."</p> <p>He didn't hear her words, not even her moan, his words were all the words but that mattered. She felt and she felt like a little more than anyone he did in her body. So much in the entire universe's whole body. It was in her eyes. She was like a whole she. Her entire body but her. Every single and her entire body was herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
