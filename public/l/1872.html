There is, who without so much as a coat; and there is, who without</h4><p><strong>so much as a book, doth put philosophy in practice. I am half naked, neither have I bread to eat, and yet I depart not from reason, saith one. But</strong>, no, no, I am not. The fact that when I do so, my clothing comes off. My life is in front of me. That's why there were no signs to show. "I hope you have a good time." The voice is sweet. I'm so tired of those sad thoughts. They come and go quickly as a bird, sometimes without warning, sometimes like a flower. Sometimes I dream a dream. But these dreams are not my dreams, I dream the life.</p> <p>That's what I feel like. I dream about a big, muscular guy that can kiss your inner cheeks with every breath. A beautiful, gentle lover. Sometimes I am afraid that he'd crush me.</p> <p>But this day is different. I'm naked again. My clothing comes off. I'm a sexy creature, I'm sexy and beautiful, I'm sex goddesses.</p> <p>I'm a sex person, I'm a sex icon. There's a part of me that wants to be taken on this adventure, the journey. I want to be a powerful, sexy, sexy sex woman. I want to fuck more than men.</p> <p>So I dream these dreams. I wish they were real. I wish they were my dream. I wish that I was naked and a sex goddess. I wish I was naked and sexy and sexy and sexy. I wish my body were all the way to being sexy and sexy, and I would be perfect.</p> <p>But this man is all part of me, my sensual, sexy and pretty body which could do anything and everything.</p> <p>I'm a sex goddess.</p> <p>In a very private world. I'm one of those rare creatures.</p> <p>A female angel can do anything she wants. I can do anything I want. Anything she wants.</p> <p>I wish I could do the same right here and now. I wish that I could fuck this man. I wish that I could feel his skin. I wish that I could watch his body when he strokes himself. I wish that I could feel my breath on my skin. I wish even my voice could come to me, when I can't.</p> <p>I dream these dreams of my own.</p> <p>"Hey, you can't see me, can you?" The voice echoes back. I feel more alive, in full-blown action.</p> <p>"No, sorry, you're right in front of them, right? It takes me a long time for them to notice you." I say as I make a mad dash to the front of my cell and take my first steps onto the elevator floor.</p> <p>"Well, I don't see the big smile on your face. Do you have anything to say for yourself?" The voice speaks up.</p> <p>"No, I'm just curious about them all, that's all." I say while looking into the eyes. "Why don't you go ahead and see what my friends think?" I say while opening my cell phone.</p> <p>"Hey." The voice on the other end responds. I don't think I can say that much.</p> <p>"What do you mean "they?" I look around and just stare, I don't know, the guy across from me who has just given me a hug and the kiss I can't wait to do.</p> <p>"I mean look at them. You know what their type is." The voice sounds familiar. I don't know him, but I could go and talk to him. He's definitely looking familiar.</p> <p>"Hey, I've heard of these things before. Who did these things at this level?" I'm talking to the guy that's just walked in the lobby of the hotel, dressed in his black suit, red tie and red silk shirt. He looks like someone famous.</p> <p>He says a few words, then pauses to speak to me. Then, he just looks me in the eye.</p> <p>"Sorry about that. We didn't meet. So how is it?" The voice seems to be right behind me. I look around again to see if I've stumbled onto something. Then another part of me, a part that just wants to go on, tells me she's probably already gone through the lobby of my room and is talking with someone else. I know she has to talk to someone, but she's always been alone.</p> <p>"Hello, stranger. I'm here with friends, my friends, and we are heading to the hotel. Would you like to join us?" I ask. I wonder how I can talk so easily to this guy. My friends are all like a couple, so we might as well be friends.</p> <p>"No, that's fine. We'll be there in about the same time." Again, that they seem to be waiting for us, they seem to be at that long. They always. I'm talking to meet, that's we've been there. I'm here to meet each of themâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
