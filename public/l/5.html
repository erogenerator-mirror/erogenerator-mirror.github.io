Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made</strong> a very lucrative trade. He had also made a very lucrative trade when he got an invitation to a frat party hosted by one of the best students in the university. The house had been set up to produce a rather interesting set of equipment. It was made of very fine black and chrome and had very nice knays and cuffs. The dildos were in an open frame and had a wide flared base attached to the harness.</p> <p>On the evening as Sir William and his wife Annabelle were sitting around drinking and drinking, the doorbell rang again. This time it was for two women. In the middle of the house was a black and shiny, black man in his thirties with thick, muscular arms. The two women made their presence known. Sir William and this handsome man took the girls to their bedroom where they proceeded to fuck the crap out of them.</p> <p>William's wife had on matching nighties. He watched as one by one they each dropped their lingerie onto the floor. His cock rose to full mast as he watched his wife on her hands and knees, her pussy eaten to another man, on her back, her arse raised and spread with two men to thrust their cocks into her. Soon the woman was lifting her head off the floor, her pussy gaping in eager anticipation as two cocks thrust their cocks into her.</p> <p>It was not long before a man came in the women's mouths. They were in a sixty-nine. The man was sucking on a female nipple while the woman was licking his shaft and balls. One man was licking his balls as the other man worked a rubber cock into and out of the woman's well-fucked pussy.</p> <p>As the woman came, a man came in his wife's mouth and as the man pulled out some man, his wife stood and bent over the sofa, offering her mouth to the man whose cock she had already taken.</p> <p>Sir William and his wife Annabelle watched through glazed eyes as the man's cum squirted into their wives' mouth causing them both to ejaculate. Their mouths hungrily sought out his cock and sucked on it for another half an hour.</p> <p>The two men finally pulled out of the four women, who remained on their knees on the floor, their faces still buried in each other breasts, kissing and caressing each other.</p> <p>"Welcome to the club, Miss Annabelle," the distinguished looking man said with enthusiasm in his eyes. "I was just thinking of letting you have a seat at the table next to the couch and get some work done."</p> <p>William's wife Annabelle smiled and said, "I was going to ask you a long-standing friend of mine, Mr. Harrison, if you were available anytime." She got up and went to the front and started to dress herself in a formal gown. William was busy getting drinks and food.</p> <p>Sir William called George into his office after leaving his wife to look in on her wedding guests and asked if they had some time for some work. He told him that their guest had arrived and they were invited to join him in the main office. George smiled and went to the doorway of the office to open the door.</p> <p>George was pleased to see their house so inviting, especially as that was where he sat on the couch on the first day that they had ever had a wedding. They had been on the first day of their engagement so they would be able to relax and enjoy a relaxing evening before a busy day.</p> <p>George stood and came around the coffee table to sit near the three chairs that George normally sat on. He looked very attractive without his wedding ring on his hand.</p> <p>William's wife Annabelle came over to him and said, "Hello George! How are you?"</p> <p>He said, "I'm very good, Miss Annabelle." He turned to his wife, Annabelle, turned to his new bride and said, "I know that you are all married, Miss Annabelle, but what brings you here tonight?"</p> <p>George asked, "Perhaps if I can convince you of a little something of Miss Thomas's wedding present. I would be glad to tell you all of those things so you can get acquainted." He got up and sat beside his wife while his manhood rose.</p> <p>His wife Annabelle looked at George as if she was afraid that his offer might not be accepted. William's eyes were glistening as they looked at her. She looked very beautiful and very very sexy.</p> <p>Mr. Harrison gave Mr. Harrison a business card and left the two of them alone to discuss the problem that they both were having about the price of a marriage. They said that the wedding ring was going to be the right of the very old lady's hand and that they saw it but would needn't marry.</p> <p></p> <p>To make a decision that, if it be the ladyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
