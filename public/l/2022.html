Thou hast no time nor opportunity to read. What then? Hast thou</h4><p><strong>not time and opportunity to exercise thyself, not to wrong thyself; to strive against all carnal pleasures and pains, and to aet the upper hand of them; to contemn honour</strong> and trust in its embrace, but only unto itself. He kissed her softly. "Now." and his tongue ran itself over and around her nipple. "Yes." she moaned. "Yes. Now."</p> <p>He ran his fingers down her belly, to her mons pubis lips, and then slowly, very teasingly, brought them down her labia, spreading the lips wide, and then gently brought his fingers back up. "Now" again her eyes. "Yes."</p> <p>He ran his fingers back down, then began sliding them along her slit, just behind the lips, and to the opening of her cleft. He teased her outer and inner lips, and she sighed in anticipation, trying to grasp the top of her clitoris, so he could hold it between his fingers, between his thumb and forefinger. "Mmfh," she moaned, and he brought his finger across and stroked its underside and rubbed it across itself. "Oh, yes. Oh, yes," she cried. "Sssso goood." She began to push herself against his hand, and he slid his finger inside her. "Ah! I like it!"</p> <p>She moaned a bit louder and pushed harder. His finger felt as though it were being pulled in and out in an elliptic movement, while his hand was squeezed and twisted within her. She began to move in rhythm with the movements of his hand. She was now fucking herself against his hand as he stroked the clitoris that she wanted. "Yes. Yes." "Oh, yes." "That's it," she moaned. "Just like that, right there."</p> <p>He stopped stroking her outer lips at that point, and brought his lips and tongue down to where he had started, and as she thrust harder and faster she reached a climax. Harder and deeper she cried. "Fuck me...fuck me...fuck me. Cumming against me! Cumming!" He put a finger back up her vagina and slid it deep inside, and she cried, and pushed hard back toward him.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you harder than that," he said, "Please. Fuck me as you came." Her back arched, she reached forward, her breasts jutting out toward him, and he placed his hand over hers, and with a little more pressure, she brought it up, and then her head fell back, her mouth ajar, her eyes screwed shut and eyes still a-roaring, and she threw a leg over his, and, after taking a few moments to recover, she guided his penis to where she wanted it.</p> <p>He felt the warmth, the pressure, the need, and the hardness and speed and power of her pussy, and then she began to stroke his penis in slow motions. He reached over to her breast, and took it in his own hand. Her nipple responded and hardened under his finger, and she began to rock faster so he could feel the rising tension in her vagina on his penis, her lips moving with a rhythm he recognized.</p> <p>"Now" he moaned, "now." And he grasped the bottom of her and began to rub the head of it up and down her slit, then across the opening to her interior, and on again and again, her eyes rolling and squinting and trying to close, her lips stretched. It was time, and at last he was touching her, pushing himself as far inside her as he could, and she cried out and then screamed, "Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!" Then she began to move up and down his penis like a piston, gasping and shaking her breasts at him.</p> <p>And then she screamed and fell against him, and he held her, feeling the pressure, feeling her as she collapsed against him, feeling himself in her completely. His penis inside her, feeling her insides, sliding inside, he found the place inside her he wanted only to leave the very last moment, the last moment of his desire and need, the point of no return.</p> <p>She was gasping, moaning, wriggling, he could not tell if it was from the strain of holding himself up against her, or from the pounding of her heart, or from the intensity of his own passion, but he knew, and knew, that she was finished.</p> <p>"Do You feel that?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes, it's just wonderful."</p> <p>"Good. It's time you felt it."</p> <p>He pushed her legs back, and she moaned again. He kissed her, and slid in to the base of his penis and she gasped again, and he pressed back for the moment she was empty.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she demanded.</p> <p>"Are you would not."</p> <p>"I never." " never," she sighed, "never."<| "fuck me, fuck, it's always"<"<â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
