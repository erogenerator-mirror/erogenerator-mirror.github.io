Dost thou grieve that thou dost weigh but so many pounds, and not</h4><p><strong>three hundred rather? Just as much reason hast thou to grieve that thou must live but so many years, and not longer. For as for bulk and substance thou dost</strong> be glad you dost make thou so rich; for as the sun hath shinening in the midst of the sun and the moon within, I can see what an exquisite pleasure God's pleasures are to the eye. In a way a child is in its time, because, like all creatures of the earth, men have seen enough.</p> <p>I'm not the only one whose age or maturity or experience in life, as my son, so I should say. You know, my son, you might not be right for such a handsome man. My father too is rather plain, so don’t look too long at the resemblance.”</p> <p>“But I suppose, given a chance, a man would look twice, and then three times.”</p> <p>“But surely you know,” said Jhardron. “They've just changed. They’d all be far older than I.”</p> <p>Darguni blushed and looked away forlorn.</p> <p>“I know,” said Jhardron. “But a man of forty should be able to go for ages in a day.”</p> <p>“And why do I’ve seen so many men in all ages?”</p> <p>“All the old men. They’re all beautiful, all the young ones are like children, all the young ones are young, and all the old ones are old.”</p> <p>“All the fucking old men? No, how’d you know?”</p> <p>“Well, they’ve got to be in their late fifties, they’ve been around for too long, and they all have big tits. I’ve heard the best of them all the time: they’re real beauts, don’t say it like it, but most of the others are so well endowed they’ll fall out of the top of their shorts, so don’t you think you should at least take them all the proper precautions to ensure you get it all.”</p> <p>“All the best protection I’m ever gonna get!”</p> <p>“Well, we can’t have that,” said Darguni, still avoiding eye contact with the girl. “There’ll be many of us in this house.”</p> <p>“Not you old men, young men,” said Jhardron. He was looking at his father’s penis now, and knew that his mother’s father had been much taller than he was. “I don’t want anyone else to make any mistakes.”</p> <p>“All those men are still young. I can’t be much older than fifty-five years old,” said Jhardron. “I might even make a good fifty-five!” To Darguni’s surprise the girl had blushing bright red and averting her eyes, but as he gazed at her, it was evident that she was turned on by him. She was certainly quite attractive, and despite having a lovely pair of tits to go with her age, Darguni felt himself getting hard.</p> <p>“You can’t be much older,” said Jhardron, looking her up and down. “You can tell by looking at your mother’s body.” Then he felt his body start to shiver, as excitement rushed through him suddenly, making him feel as if he was about to fall if he didn’t get off the bed. So, without saying a word, he went over to the bed and sat down next to his mother.</p> <p>Darguni was about to protest when Jhardron drew his arm up. “You shouldn’t be doing it, my son.”</p> <p>“I shouldn’t,” replied Jhardron, sitting still, not looking at each other. “But you should think about it. It’s better to be prepared than to be embarrassed.”</p> <p>Darguni glanced at his father’s penis now. “It’s all right, Dad. Don’t worry; it’s all right. They’ve got to know it’s normal for mother to do what she did a long time ago,” Darguni, being aware of his father’s feelings, told him. “You’ll be able to feel it every day if you look back on this moment.”</p> <p>“But what about your father? Do you?” asked Jhard. Jhard. “Why did he was feeling a little confused. he was surprised but pleased that his mother had been able to feel the penis, and enjoy—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
