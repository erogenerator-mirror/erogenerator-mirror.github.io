The Pacific.</h4><p><strong>When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted</strong> blessings, like today, when we were on this world journey. I know all of this is for, what, a little, and that you know not a damn thing, dear readers?</p> <p>When you're with a girl, a little sex is good.</p> <p>Where a boy's love is sweet, a little sex is wonderful.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>At first, I suppose I was just curious who the lucky guy would be. I would see her in a swimming costume, her hair was tied in a tight ponytail, her lips were red and ready to be kissed, and she wasn't wearing a stitch! That had to be him, though, because that was how I felt all too well that night when we came home from a party and we ended up having sex in the back seat of my car! I was thinking I'd have to do it when this beautiful young girl finally got to me!</p> <p>I was pretty excited, too, after what we had done the night before, but the best I could do was pretend that everything went well and it didn't actually happen, so I let it go, okay? But then at the conclusion of the day and all my heart was racing, too, especially not in my pants, because there's nothing in every man's brain more eager to satisfy a wet pussy than the thought of my sweet little little girl getting really pissed at me so hard she couldn't breathe!</p> <p>She had the nerve to tell me all about her feelings for him, to him, and I couldn't believe it. But how could I have given up anything, when I'd already been thinking about this and thinking about how I might be doing him with her, on that same bed, when I could hardly wait? The thought of being with my sweet and perfect girl on that bed filled me with an overwhelming sense of gratitude for what I'd done and how it seemed like it was going to happen.</p> <p>Now after seeing her, my own cock was hard and ready, and I had just begun touching myself, thinking of how I'd have to wait a little while to finally let her get home and I wouldn't be able to contain myself!</p> <p>I'd been thinking about her all day, imagining that she'd finally be able to come home again as soon as she got here, without any drama, so she could feel really, really nice! But I hadn't ever touched myself like a real woman should have, and I never got so turned on that I actually came that first time she came home! Oh, the thought of the feeling that brought on the real thing!</p> <p>And now with the thought of a woman coming home to her man, I felt my own pulse speeding and I knew I wouldn't last long. I thought about her breasts. I really wanted to suck on them, to run my tongue all over them, to squeeze them in my hand and kiss each one, to bite, to lick and suck on them. I fantasized about being a woman with a man, as though she could actually get off with me while my guy's tongue was in her wet pussy, as if I had a cock in there and I was getting off too!</p> <p>I was going to make my own thoughts a porno!</p> <p>The thought of it was making me feel so turned on again. I felt as though I was on my first honeymoon!</p> <p>I wasn't sure it was possible to feel that way about someone else, but the thought of someone touching her had given me a feeling I couldn't quite describe. It made me think of kissing her, the way my lips were so close to her, and I wondered what she would feel like if I kissed her like this! Would she want to kiss me so I too kissed her, and even if she didn't, would she kiss me any other way? Would she kiss me there? Would she really want to kiss me there and feel the softness of his lips against hers?</p> <p>It was almost a relief when I got home that night to find my wife was already in bed! We'd been up all night thinking of what we'd do. We'd been out to dinner when she got home all too late and then come upstairs to watch tv together, all while I got so hot that I needed to undress and come in her. I'd gotten so hot and so wet by that time that it had been so long since I'd had sex in that way and I'd been really nervous thinking how I might make myself come. I was always nervous about that. After last night with my wife I just couldn't get enough. I couldn't wait to see my beautiful, sexy, sexy and very sexy, nervous wife in the girl I'd come home!</p> <p></p> <p>And I also, after watching her getting into her house I discovered there I couldn't seem to find she was the feeling so much more than how much that I had been a sense she felt, aâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
