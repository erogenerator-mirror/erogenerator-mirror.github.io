The Island of Tiboulen</h4><p><strong>Dantès, although stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath, and as his right hand (prepared as he was for every chance) held his knife</strong> in the right position, the cold stone blade, when it was on the tip of his penis, started at the base and glided up to the tip and under the helmet. The cold surface of the knife, his erection, was in his right hand as well. His penis was already getting hard. He wondered if the knife tip would ever give a straight razor-sharp razor-blade. (If it did not, then he was going to need some kind of blade.) The knife blade was just about the same width as the shaft, but his penis was much deeper, so the blade did not even touch the head, which was probably why he did not move his free hand. The knife, however, came very close to touching him. So close that he felt his penis stiffen and move. He did not move on his own. So close that he could almost feel his cock in his hand, and that made him more certain that the blade would not be touching him.</p> <p>Because there was no reason to fight it. The blade tip could surely enter any part of his body now. And the knife tip could penetrate any part of his body and not hurt him. (By now he was sure of that possibility.)</p> <p>His penis grew harder. He thought to do a slow wiggle. But, after a few seconds of this, the blade slipped away. He thought, 'Why? There is that danger? It is obvious.) But his penis was now hard as a steel rod. He still kept his fingers at the base, just far enough to keep them in contact with his penis. He did not move.</p> <p>Then the blade head came into sight, and he thought, 'Now what? Did I have to fight this for all these years?' As he looked into the eyes of the blade, his penis pulsed. He was so excited that he did not feel so many different sensations. He was also very excited for this knife tip, even as the first moments after it entered his body sent electrical signals straight to his brain, sending an electrical message inside his brain.</p> <p>He knew that if he did not move, the knife blade would be moving with him. He felt his penis moving between the sharp edge of the blade tip, and it glided back up his pole.</p> <p>Then he felt the knife tip sliding to the tip on his anus. He thought, 'No! A knife tip!' But the knife tip was moving between his anus and the smooth, cold steel! The feeling was too good. He felt a soft push as the knife tip moved inside him. He opened his eyes and saw that the knife tip was inside his anus. After a few moments of that, he realized that the blade was going to penetrate his anus, and he expected it to enter his anus and push the knife blade deeper inside him.</p> <p>His penis was now pulsing, throbbing, throbbing, but it was also throbbing inside his mind, so there was no escape. He had to fight the knife blade, though, but he feared for him only the death of his body. He knew that he should fight, but only an inch or so of blade was in his body, so he didn't think of it as anything but a tool for doing what is what is right.</p> <p>But the knife tip did not come out of his anus. The blade did not move in. The blade did not touch any part of his body. The blade began to slide a bit deeper into his body. And at the base was where his penis started, and his balls started to swell.</p> <p>And his penis did not go down the sides of the blade, which is another reason that he held on with his free hand. The blade tip had entered his body, and it went even further. And the knife tip inside his mind also went inwards.</p> <p>Now it was all part of the knife tip inside him, but it was not going in very far. The blade tip entered his anus, though, so it moved inside. But in a way, it was not going inside his anus, but inside his anus where the knife tip was coming from. His vagina and anus were actually touching him and the knife blade was inside him, and he could not move. There was no way that he could fight the knife into the throat of the blade tip.</p> <p>Now it was all part of the knife tip: the tip pushed against his anus and the blade tip inside his body.</p> <p>His body betrayed him again. He could feel his body betraying him. His body wanted the knife tip to move even more inside him. His soul gave into the surrender of his body. He felt that he had surrendered himself to this knife tip. He had surrendered to do something else. His body would refuse his own. His body. The blade.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"My body now, I am</p> <p></p> <p>You are now</p> <p>It Your mind You are—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
