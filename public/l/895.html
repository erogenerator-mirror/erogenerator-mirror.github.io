I've been at this fuck-up for a year, the time of my life, and there's nothing I could ever be happier than to be on this fuck-up like this.</p> <p>I guess I should start at the beginning, because the end of my first year of university seemed to take a different shape than anything that went on over the last few months. My girlfriend Emily turned out to be just great. She was all the way around in England—fancy London—and she had the prettiest face and body on the planet—with a pair of tits that seemed to defy gravity and curves. I had a crush on her—for a couple months—and we had sex as often as the next day, and she was gorgeous, and my favourite girl. And after, during sex, whenever I wanted her with that hot, juicy-looking bod, I fucked to the end when it felt like I had cum into her pussy.</p> <p>There might have been no end to the fuck-up, but this is the story and the beginning.</p> <p>That's a real good start to the story.</p> <p>So I'm walking the corridors, and I'm in a different world to those boring classes in my university, where every time I see a beautiful young girl walking by in that sort of outfit I'll be wondering whether someone's fucking me. But I don't have to wonder what kind of fuck-up a blow-up a fuck-up is, because I've finally been fucked by a fucking girl. And I'm sure my girlfriend Emily is the girl I fancy. So it's no surprise when we both end up in this hotel room fucking on the bed, my cock thrusting into her pussy as it pleases her, while the other one, which I've already been fucking several times in one night, does the same to me over and over.</p> <p>The room is full of the sexiest naked girls of all time. And we have that fucking sex, when it feels so fucking good, and we can almost forget that it's my first time.</p> <p>So the story continues.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Emily's a very good fuck.</p> <p>Well, yes, I am—and if it hadn't just been a few weeks, I don't even know how I could have imagined this first fuck night.</p> <p>Of course, there can be other things. The thing most girls who want to fuck—or at least fuck at university age—have to do is to say that they have to say they have to go off and fuck a few guys, just to make sure they don't have to feel like they're being followed on a ship out of water, to be followed up and back again in a very strange place on the other side of an enormous space station, and so the only thing you need to talk about is the size of the cock, whether the guys get the girl right to fuck them, whether she's got any lube or something, whether you can actually say the word "fucking" without sounding a bit stupid, to which the guy, with some sense of self confidence, can tell you how big he is of the dick.</p> <p>The thing that really turns heads is how big it feels. When a girl's cunt is full, especially when she's got two fingers up her ass, it's not an easy thing to say to let her know that she's got the size of a fucking cock, especially in a state of dress and with her own fingers around your neck, but that's a good start. She's got it a lot.</p> <p>You can ask her, and if they're really big, they should be. And they can sometimes seem to be, like, huge—if you know what I mean, don't you?—and sometimes they'll just be the tightest little mounds, so that they just seem to bounce up and down just as, oh, they sure are a lovely pair of tits. Well, I didn't find them ugly but, as far as I know, she's got a pretty nice figure, too. She's got, by far, the largest set of tits I've ever seen on a girl. Of course, I have no idea whether her tits are real. You've got to be able to look at them, and the whole room just seems to be a mirror, or mirror and shine down like a shine through a lamp, and you can see her whole breasts in every colour of her body.</p> <p></p> <p>the whole world, of fucking her, that great girl, you have the girl have this, no need to you have a great to be able, and the world—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
