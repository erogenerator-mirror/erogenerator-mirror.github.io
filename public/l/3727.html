Midnight. Nobody in the room. The clock on the mantelpiece strikes twelve. The fire is not alight: it is a summer night. Presently Higgins and Pickering</strong> are both at the desk. "Where do you want me to start?"</p> <p>"Stick it in your cunt." The desk has the same writing as mine.</p> <p>"You want me to put this in my ass?"</p> <p>And it is in, and I stick it in. But where? At first we are just fucking. But I want to fuck in and in. "That's it, right there."</p> <p>"Is it a cock?"</p> <p>"It's a cock," I repeat. And we are fucking. And we are fucking. And we are fucking. And we are fucking. And we are fucking. And we are fucking. Our balls can't move. We do not move either, until I say, but we do not move now. We are connected.</p> <p>And I say, "I'm your new teacher, Mr. Wright."</p> <p>"This is not a class," she replies.</p> <p>"We have not yet had intercourse, have we? We have just fucked."</p> <p>"So this is a fucking class. If we were one of my students, this would be too much for me."</p> <p>We fuck, and then we fuck. Our cums explode, and we cum again and again. But this time is no one's. We fuck and cum again, again and again until we fall back, exhausted. "You haven't cum for me yet, though. You know I can do anything." I don't care.</p> <p>We do each other's parts in bed, and then we sleep. We wake up again, and we fuck. We fuck and we cum again. We fuck and sleep, again. Again and again.</p> <p>When we wake up the next day, the class is over. We fuck and cum. We fuck and cum again. We fuck and cum again. And we kiss each other and kiss and kiss again, and we kiss and cum, again. It is just sex. It is a good orgasm.</p> <p>At home on Monday, I get in line at the coffee kiosk. We are kissing. I want to suck on her tits. I want to suck on her pussy. I want to fuck her ass. I want to see her beautiful body, her perfect ass. I want to fuck her asshole. I want to fill her ass with my fat cock and fill her with cum.</p> <p>We eat together at the end of class, and fuck at lunch time. We don't suck each other's tongues off each other's cocks. We don't just fuck: we fuck. We eat each other, and we fuck each other, and we cum together again.</p> <p>Friday morning at work at my apartment.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>When Professor Wright arrived Friday evening, he was wearing a blue dress shirt, worn from the 1980. His wife was not there. He drove to the coffee kiosk, got a coffee from in-store, and walked to the coffee kiosk. He sat there for a good long while, drinking coffee. Then he walked up to the kiosk where the waitress, a gorgeous blonde with a fantastic figure, was serving coffee and sugar.</p> <p>"Hey, thanks for coming to stop here today; I saw you driving to the coffee kiosk with the waitress. Was that the first time you met her?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you don't look like somebody I'm not supposed to meet. You look beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you sir, I thought that I would blend into the background."</p> <p>"This is class. This is my teaching job. My name is Professor Wright. I'm not here to teach. We could go to a different place now."</p> <p>"Please take off your shirt, sir. I'll get that for you."</p> <p>"Yes," said. Professor Wright removed his shirt: he has nice bare chest. He took his time getting the shirt off. He didn't have a muscular body.</p> <p>"I see, I didn't quite figure you out, man. You are a good, strong, good-looking man."</p> <p>"Well sir, thanks for the compliment. But I'll give you a demonstration first, if you would like to see my erection."</p> <p>"Is this a demonstration, or a demonstration?" he said, not at all interested in learning about being a man.</p> <p>"Well, it means you will do everything I say for me."</p> <p>"Very well," said. "And how should I do that? How should I show you my erections?"</p> <p>"Well, since you were here this morning, and I have not done anything to please you, I may demonstrate."</p> <p>"Then I think for your demonstration, I'll start with you first, with my penis, you, and on my balls, on the nipples."</p> <p></p> <p>"Now, it's my penis, balls, my cockâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
