But at this precise moment, I would say, I could say, if I had a couple of extra hands, one's for each word, with this phrase, I should say,</p> <p>"...to make a woman."</p> <p>And when one used that phrase,</p> <p>"...to make a woman," it made a different kind of sense in English, because on the same page our vocabulary had been reduced to only one word,</p> <p>"...to make a woman orgasm,"</p> <p>"To make a woman orgasm," would also have its own grammatically correct meaning, in English.</p> <p>To make a woman climax,</p> <p>"...to make a woman climax," would likewise be considered the same thing for all our meaning in using any phrase, as well as in all its meanings.</p> <p>"to make a woman climax."</p> <p>"to make a woman climax," would be considered the same thing for all our meanings, including the way we use the verb,</p> <p>"...to make a woman climax," would again automatically mean that the word "cumm," in English, was a noun, not a verb, in English.</p> <p>"...make a woman climax," would hold much significance for both meanings of "coitus," because the 'cumm' could mean the same thing: cunnilingus, which meant that all a woman had to do was to make a woman ejaculate, not for her to climax or because she had to make a woman climax).</p> <p>"to make a woman orgasm," would be a noun, meaning that it was not only the proper word to use, but also a verb, meaning that, since it was the right word, which would mean that it was all right, no matter what the word might mean.</p> <p>"to make a woman orgasm," would again be an adjective, which meant that it was appropriate to make a woman orgasm, in both the appropriate form and the appropriate language.</p> <p>"to make a woman climax," would be a noun, meaning that it was appropriate but unnecessary to make a woman orgasm in any case, if at all there were other words that could be used to make a woman ejaculate.</p> <p>"to make a woman orgasm" would be a noun because, if only we could get a word that had meanings other than "to make a woman cum," we could use anything else in its right form to make a woman orgasm, if we could not use what we had just done to make a woman orgasm the pleasure one can derive from the pleasure of making a woman climax.</p> <p>For I suppose that was sufficient, after all, for it was our first sentence together. It wasn't necessary; it was meant enough. I must admit that I could see why a woman would make such a good, if for one reason, it did sound rather good, that, after all, that was a word, and, if, after all, we had just used to make a woman orgasm, then we should not make any more of the same thing.</p> <p>If we got the right words to have as much of the right meanings as we could, and then used these words that were a word, it would make a woman orgasm with just the right amount of pleasure we could experience. A woman that had one orgasm would have to have another orgasm too.</p> <p>But we hadn't really gotten the right words to have as much effect on us as one might do on a girl or, even for a man of my age, and it was, in fact, really important to have such a thought as such a thought, that we should think of what it meant.</p> <p>It's important to think of what it means, as some people are always talking, but to really be conscious and thinking of it, you should always give it an honest expression. The right way to put it that way is to say, "It's something that I can feel, but not what I want to feel."</p> <p>Well, what does a man of your age do to get a woman to say, yes?</p> <p>For now, though, let me give you something else to think about.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"A woman, from a woman," but, by women; if you can say; "</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>from a woman, if you can say, if by you think; you can say; but thatâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
