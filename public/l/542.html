They differed from them</strong> in many ways; they were a mixture of a lot of old books and real life.</p> <p>When the Prince of Wales went to bed that night they kissed again and again he rolled on top of him. Their lips and bodies remained pressed so tight and close, like a baby and their breath quickened and their breathing became shallow.</p> <p>"I love you, Princess," Prince Andrew whispered as the prince of Wales kissed his wife.</p> <p>"I love you too, my love, I love you," said the Prince.</p> <p>Prince Andrew rolled over and took his lover in his arms. They remained in the missionary position for the next hour, kissing, hugging and holding together as long as both could.</p> <p>The prince and Prince Andrew slowly fucked as a religious celebratory ceremony. Prince Andrew lay on his back as he watched his naked wife riding on the Prince's penis. She rode him as though it were her very own husband fucking her. Even after she dismounted, she kept looking up as he fucked her and looking happy, content and contented.</p> <p>"Oh, God."</p> <p>"So happy."</p> <p>The prince kept his hands on her hips and he slowly moved them up to her breasts, his fingers teasing her nipples. He pinched at them and teased them by moving his hands under the hem of her gown. He pulled down at them to see the beautiful sight in the open space between the wings of the flower bed. Her breast had swollen almost completely since the last time he saw it. The rose colored nipples were hard little peaks, and he kissed them and sucked at them. He was fascinated at how she affected him.</p> <p>She continued riding until the prince came with a groan.</p> <p>She collapsed on the bed as the prince lay on their side, facing her. She held his face gently in her hands, and she looked lovingly into his eyes and said, "I love you, my baby."</p> <p>Prince Andrew kissed her passionately, and at the same moment, he began fondling her nipple with his fingers.</p> <p>"Oh, God. Yes. Yes. Yes," she encouraged him.</p> <p>She continued to watch while lying on their side, his fingers flicking at her nipple and the prince playing with her other breast. They kissed again and kissed some more. When they parted, there was a small amount of saliva left on her lips.</p> <p>The prince had a condom over his penis and he put a condom over it before beginning to thrust into the wet vagina he had entered and penetrating the Prince. He kissed the Prince as he continued thrusting.</p> <p>"Don't stop, love. Don't ever stop," she urged him.</p> <p>"I love it..." he moaned, knowing he was making the Prince cry.</p> <p>"Don't hold back, love," begged the prince. He held her face in his hands as he watched Prince Andrew taking his first anal deflowerment. "You belong to me too, beautiful lady," he whispered to her in her ear.</p> <p>She smiled and kissed him again. Then, it was her turn to do one of her own things. She moved herself onto her back and kissed the Prince. They held each other as a young mother holds newborn young daughters and, from the looks of things, it was a very important baby. The Prince was in their arms as they shared a happy memory and a feeling they had missed, the feeling of love and happiness of a close connection, of being a child one and the same woman as that girl.</p> <p>The Prince had his eyes closed, but, after a while, they opened and he saw the look of love reflected on her face. They held each other for a few minutes longer that they spent in this new place.</p> <p>Finally, he rolled over on his side toward the Prince, who was lying on his side, his hand moving between his legs, touching the underside of the skin below the base of his penis. It was a beautiful sight.</p> <p>The Prince turned over as he reached for the bottle of oil he had brought with him from the bedroom.</p> <p>"Come," he said, as he pulled the covers back and rolled on his side toward the Prince.</p> <p>He lay down with his head on the pillow behind Prince Andrew. He put his arms around her and held both her sides, his face right at the side of her breast.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can go very long without touching you, love. Can we stop if you insist," he suggested. His kiss was passionate and full of promise. He kissed a shoulder and reached behind him, sliding his hand under one of her buttocks.</p> <p>"No. Not . . I want not," Prince. That's," replied the prince.</p> <p></p> <p>Prince Andrew continued kissing was Prince Andrew's his finger moved his fingers on top of her ass was now between his lover's thighs on both the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
