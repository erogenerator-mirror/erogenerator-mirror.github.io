For a man that hath passed away his Right to one man to day, hath it not to passe to morrow to another:</strong> I am old, my life, to come, by night after night, I was to me, a man's. In times past, by day, I was to me.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>My eyes began to tear from my tearfulness. "What do you wanna?" I asked with my eyes wide.</p> <p>"Let me sleep," he said back.</p> <p>"No!" I protested.</p> <p>"You wanna sleep," He replied.</p> <p>I smiled at him, hoping he didn't hate me.</p> <p>"Why don't you sit on that log," I suggested.</p> <p>"Why don't you lie over there and I'll get you to cum with me?" He demanded as he pulled out the key to the cabin.</p> <p>"No," I said loudly.</p> <p>"Don't argue," He said while kneeling alongside me. He pulled the key and let my left leg sit down. I sat on the log, but before leaning on it. He moved behind me, unzipping his pants while he reached his left leg out towards my hand. I slid it up under my loose fitting shirt while my right hand grasped his erection.</p> <p>"I want to fuck ya," He said as his breathing became labored.</p> <p>He began guiding his penis with his hand while I began taking it in my mouth.</p> <p>"That's a pretty hot cock," I said as we took turns sucking his cock and feeling his fingers squeeze my hair.</p> <p>We took turns sucking the other off while he reached up behind and pinched my ass. I could hear my voice rising in response.</p> <p>While the three of us took turns sucking, I got my right hand down below to rub his balls, which he did the same to me. Finally, a moment later I felt his hand sliding over my ass and towards the crack as I pushed my legs further apart, trying to pull my ass closer. I felt his finger slip into my moist sex. He began slowly finger-fucking me, but he was soon going mad on me as he pulled my hand away and forced his index and middle finger into my pussy while he held my waist firmly. It was a strange situation since if he didn't shove them in harder they would have popped right out. We continued this for what felt like an eternity but seemed like hours. After he had finger fucked me for a while he had found my G-spot. When he found it and began to press his finger right against it in a circular pattern he finally brought us both to a shuddering climax. It was the most intense orgasm I've ever experienced after climaxing with him. I don't know how I ever regained my senses after this. All I can say is that I don't regret doing it.</p> <p>We both got dressed, pulled our shoes back on, and climbed behind the log so that we could continue the conversation. "How about making my first ever fuck memorable," I said while I took my socks off and walked back to my cabin. When I returned I felt my skirt lifting as I tried to get my panties off to no avail. "You're not the kind of woman that makes a man feel good," He said as he began to walk away.</p> <p>"Come here," I said to him. "I want some more of your cock."</p> <p>"Can I fuck you, too?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said while looking at the head of his penis with some curiosity.</p> <p>"Okay," He grinned. "I'll be right here."</p> <p>"Can you help me?"</p> <p>"Sure," He said as he headed towards his cabin.</p> <p>"Please don't hurt me," I begged him. "I'll be fine..."</p> <p>"I won't hurt you, I promise," he said before leaving.</p> <p>"I don't want you to hurt me, you can fuck me all you want," I told him.</p> <p>"If you ever want to fuck me again, I'll be there," he said as he walked towards me.</p> <p>"I want to be on my stomach over the log, you know."</p> <p>He stood near me, but did not enter me. Instead he reached around my hip and unzipped my skirt. I put my hand down to guide him towards me. He quickly slipped his fingers down inside of my panties and began to finger me, just as I was doing before. In and out, he would finger me, but it was getting more and more difficult to do as his own hand would sometimes go where his dick should go. The other times in a while, I'd do him with my fingers, but he seemed quite a bit more confident as he was more of an experienced and he didn't take as much time. If he could go all the time.</p> <p></p> <p>I started to feel his hand on my panties as long fingers could go down, but when I could go as if myâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
