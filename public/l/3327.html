English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXIX. The Shadow.</h4><p><strong>Here we have a description of that courageous and wayward spirit that literally haunts the footsteps of every great thinker and every great leader; sometimes with the result that it</strong> is only with the blessings of good fortune that you can commit to the past of great history and of great love.</p> <p>A loving relationship with a loving partner will always be an adventure and thus a memorable time for you and I.</p> <p>Now that you know a great story, and that one is a great one, now we can begin.</p> <p>I was in love with my ex-boyfriend, John, and it was only a matter of time as one day while he was at school teaching English class our second anniversary, that our relationship took its inevitable course. It seemed to break into an unbroken chain of bliss for the two of us and we were deeply in love.</p> <p>We would have made a great couple and it was one of the happiest times of my life!</p> <p>John is a wonderful teacher and a really good conversationalist and sometimes I would say he reminds me of my dad in High School. He wasn't so much my grandfather but more of someone that I could never have loved but I could always feel the same way.</p> <p>But now it's time to tell you just how much time we've been making love.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was a rainy Saturday morning on a warm, dark, rainy day in March. John and I lay there enjoying each other's company. Our relationship had just reached the stage where it would end before it reached another painful point and we knew it was now time to end the discussion.</p> <p>"Good morning, sunshine," John had told me. "Let's start with a good morning kiss and go back to the good stuff."</p> <p>We both started kissing at the same time and John reached behind me and grasped both of my breasts in his hands. "Honey, do you like my tits?" he asked coyly.</p> <p>"They're awesome," I replied.</p> <p>"Yeah, and are they as good as I'd like to have them? The way you're feeling right now, I think they are very, very good indeed."</p> <p>John continued to caress my breasts and fondle my nipples.</p> <p>My pussy was sopping wet and I was absolutely mesmerized by his touch and by the prospect of what I was about to do.</p> <p>I lowered my arms from my lap and John slid a leg between mine and gently pressed my crotch against his leg so that he was pressing his groin against my pussy.</p> <p>"Okay, John honey, time to continue the lesson."</p> <p>His hand began to roam all over my body and the feel of his hands was a turn on. It felt so nice to be caressed by a man. In my mind I thought that I'd never get tired of feeling a man caressing me like this. I loved his gentle touch and the way he had just turned me on with his hands. It made my pussy lips feel tingly like that. John continued to cup one of my breasts and stroke the soft skin just above the erect nipple. He did this for an extended time and I responded by moaning each time he pinched it. I was really enjoying it as he massaged each breast in his hand. It was so erotic to me.</p> <p>Finally John switched my nipples with his fingers and sucked on one while he used the other hand to slowly and gently rub and fondle as it appeared that I was getting horny. When he did that, my pussy pulsated and I wanted him to feel me all over. I couldn't help but arch my back and let him know what I wanted him to do.</p> <p>"John honey, I like it when you touch my breasts like that. You know, I like it when you can give them so much pleasure."</p> <p>John continued to gently lick and suck each breast in his mouth and continued to massage my breasts and nipples in his hands. My pussy was in a turmoil again and I started to gyrate my hips. This just made his hands feel good. He brought his hands down to my waist from behind and slowly worked himself up to gently caress and rub one of my breasts.</p> <p>"You don't have the patience to do the gentle thing," I thought.</p> <p>"You're right, John" I answered as I turned over and slowly and seductively began to take off the shirt that I was wearing. John was so attentive to my body as he was undressing me and my breasts were so tender to feel his fingers on them for the first time.</p> <p>He kept teasing my nipples with his fingertips ever so lightly. It felt so wonderful. He continued licking and sucking each of my breasts for several minutes before his mouth once again reached my nipple.</p> <p>Again, I almost came and, I thought, this time seemed to end and he had come back. I felt that I felt so happy with him at my body and I could feel all over my breasts in love. When he kissed my heart. I would have made me like that was like I never againâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
