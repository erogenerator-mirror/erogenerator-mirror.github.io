In fact, the very first soldiers they had ever been faced with were now one hundred twenty soldiers, ten of them in different stages of battle, the last being General General Yrba, and his two companions, General D'Hei and Nasser.</p> <p>Nasser was about to get into the middle of the line. The two of them got into the middle of the army. It was time, he decided, for the next great adventure.</p> <p>After nearly half of the soldiers had been killed, the first thing that Nasser decided was that he should put his foot down and start a new life. For the first time in a decade, Nasser wanted to live. He wanted to die. He was ready to die. And, if not for what he had been told by his fellow soldiers that they had been waiting for him, then Nasser wouldn't be that brave. He thought to himself. There's always an open market for knowledge like this.</p> <p>After thinking to himself for a minute, Nasser gave a mental push, and the first of the soldiers that he thought he would be faced with, all of them, all of their platoon leaders, General Yrba, and the two hundred or so soldiers that he was waiting for him, all of them standing up, all of them facing him, all of them facing the future, and all of them facing the day he was going to be dead.</p> <p>He turned back around to look back at the assembled soldiers. The soldiers were all standing, all standing, facing the future. Their faces were all lined up, and their faces didn't look at all like, or at least not in the way that they were looking at the men standing next to them. The two hundred or so soldiers that stood next to him, all standing, looking right down at him. The soldiers that he was faced with, all standing, were all looking right down at him. They all had a blank face, and they all looked right down into his eyes, all looking intently at him. Nasser knew that he had nothing to fear from the soldiers in front of him, just as there was nothing behind every soldier, from every single soldier, that he was facing him with.</p> <p>Nasser turned back toward the battlefield in which he had been killed. While his platoon leader who had stood next to him before, had said that he wanted to die, Nasser also wanted to die, to save what he had once had. Nasser knew that, before they had come to the land of the Undead, they would only be in danger and he wanted, no, he wanted to go back home to see the world. Then, there was this other soldier who had stood next to him, whom he had come to know as General Yrba.</p> <p>That other soldier was Nasser's friend, Nasser's old friend, Nasser's former friend, Nasser's ex-friend, the son of the King of England, and Nasser's son in France. Then there was General Yrba, as well as General Yrba's father. Nasser nodded to himself. General Yrba hadn't been as big a hero as the General Yrba had been, and Nasser knew that General Yrba hadn't been brave enough to fight. Nasser smiled broadly.</p> <p>After all the soldiers had stood, and all the soldiers who stood next to him had stood, he saw the army returning from their attack of the undead. In fact, it seemed that everyone that stood next to him had come back from the attack of the undead, just in time. All of the soldiers were standing. Everyone seemed to be surrounded by them. Nasser walked over to their group of soldiers, one of whom stood next to him.</p> <p>"You guys," Nasser started his attack of the undead army of the undead, "now the next step is coming."</p> <p>"You're all going to die. Everyone will die," the soldiers said in unison, their faces completely blank.</p> <p>Nasser went back to his battle plan. The moment he had started his campaign, he took out General Yrba's group of soldiers from behind. Nasser had his people all standing together at the base. General Yrba and his soldiers would stand next to his.</p> <p>"Now!" Nasser shouted.</p> <p>Nasser's army continued to hold their positions. When he saw that the soldiers holding position, standing army was getting back to him, he went to the soldier, he was ready to start his attack. was ready.. "surly at the attack. All American offensive to start at their battle. to attack. and he was ready to attack. a war. noâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
