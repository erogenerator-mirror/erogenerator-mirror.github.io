The song was a song he would never forget in the history of the universe, and he had no doubt. The Emperor had never been with a black man in his life, or for that matter to one who was black. The music started. He'd been waiting to get it on with someone who could dance, but he knew it wouldn't last. The music played. People watched his dance. The Emperor began, "A man must have the music. He must want it," he would say. And people would begin chanting. They were going to dance. He'd be in there with his wife, girlfriend, or girlfriend's lover, or, oh, one person who was black and loved them for a living, be fucking a woman! The song played. He could say, "It's time," and they would be standing, and then all would be standing, cheering the man and woman and the song, all going into one place, with them dancing, like the other men and women were. That was the music.</p> <p>Everyone was in the middle rows, dancing all around him, dancing for the Emperor so that he could fuck them both on the count of ten. His wife, girlfriend, lover, or, oh, one person, be fucking her lover. He could speak, "It's time, it's time." And everyone would begin to chant, "A man must be fucking his wife, girlfriend, boyfriend or lover."</p> <p>In fact, there would be one more to be said. The Emperor began, "A man must be licking a woman's cunt," and everyone in the room would begin chanting, "A man must be licking his wife, girlfriend, boss, bitch, lover, and partner, the Emperor."</p> <p>"To be sure, he must be licking her cunt," continued the music song, "The man must be licking her cunt," and everyone started chanting, like he had been in a trance like trance. And he knew that in a time before, that too, and that was what he had been in a trance like trance. The Emperor began, "A man must be licking and sucking a woman's cunt," as the song continued.</p> <p>"To be sure," continued the music song, "The man must be licking a woman's cunt," and everyone chanted, "A man must be licking and sucking a woman's cunt," and again, to be sure, everyone chanted, "A man must be licking and sucking a woman's cunt." So, he had to lick and suck a woman's cunt all the way down to the man's feet then to the foot of his wife, girlfriend, boss, biker, boss, bitch, lover, or friend as the song went on.</p> <p>The music went up, "A man must be licking his wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, boss, boss, bitch, lover or lover as the music went on. Then, he could say, "It's the song which brings them together," and everyone's chant, "A man must be licking a woman's cunt," again before going into the same trance he had been in at the time. All of the people chanting his name, "A man must be licking a woman's cunt," would begin chanting, "A man must be licking a woman's cunt" and everyone would begin chanting.</p> <p>The song continued on. The Emperor went into the song with an inspiration. He went, "Lick a woman, girlfriend, boss, lover, or lover." Everyone cheered as the music played again. The song continued and everyone chanted. In the middle of the floor, the Emperor would stand in front of people in the middle rows, dance, and dance. But, the moment was short. He knew that nobody would come until that moment. And he knew that anyone else who looked at him, even when he was in trance, and knew the song well enough, would come.</p> <p>The Emperor, sitting on his mat, went on, "A man must be licking his wife, girlfriend, lover, or lover as the music played. And if men had a wife, girlfriend, girlfriend to love, and who loved her, they would be licked, and suck, and lick her and the other woman all the way to the top of the stairs, and come.</p> <p>"A man must be licking a woman, girlfriend, girlfriend, boss, boss, boss, bitch, boss's wife," continued the song while everyone chanted.</p> <p>With every chant, the Emperor would pause on his stage where his wife or girlfriend or lover would take his head, and press his lips to her lips, and dance and then kiss her and let go out the kiss. Everyone cheered and chanted, "A man must be licking, licked, licked."</p> <p></p> <p>"A man must lick, kiss, licked, licked, lâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
