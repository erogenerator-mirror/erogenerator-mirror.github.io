The man is in heaven.</p> <p>The moment of the act is always the most intimate part of the act; the moment of consummation of our bodies' marriage. A cock is a cotch at the deepest part of the man's body. Sometimes, in the midst of his climaxes, as the cotch is pouring down his shaft, a finger is inserted into his rectum and sometimes another joins in, giving them a little love.</p> <p>To start this story, it's important to point out that the cotch is a man's cock that comes in all the way to the man's balls. ‘Citches,’ is our word of interpretation. The cotch is a cock that is hard to penetrate and it is important to do a good job of taking up space with the other members of a room. ‘Sits and stays,' is the word of interpretation of this passage. The cotching is an ancient word from the first days on, the only word that comes from us.</p> <p>This is a story about one of the men being able to ejaculate into a woman. It is about fucking a girl without his cock being inside of her.</p> <p>The word 'vagina' stands for vaginal and male.</p> <p>The woman is a beautiful woman.</p> <p>The man could not be much older than twenty-eight.</p> <p>The story is about an older man fucking a naked young woman whom he was unable to get inside.</p> <p>The girl cannot keep herself in tune with an old man's desires. In the end, his desire for her was too strong for her and she was too frightened to want it.</p> <p>This is a romantic coupling of two men, one in a room, and one in a carriage. ‘Sits and stays,' is the word of interpretation, and it's very erotic.</p> <p>This story is about a girl who knows that the man she is talking about has an erection.</p> <p>It is about whether or not the man has an erection.”</p> <p>The woman's voice suddenly changed. It changed to a new tone. She was talking about sex. No, not talking about sex but rather about the pleasures of the sexual organ of a man.</p> <p>‘What if I’m wrong?' she asked. ‘Will I like it? Oh yes, you should. You must really like it, you'll see.’</p> <p>‘I’m sure I don’t like it. I’ve never done it before.’</p> <p>‘I don’t think I should worry,' she added. “If your erection grows on me then I'll feel you. I’ll even go down on you. I do things to him that you have never done to me before.’</p> <p>‘Is it really true? Would you enjoy to have a male penis in your vag?" she asked.</p> <p>‘How could I have thought it to be true?’</p> <p>‘Why then?’ she asked. ‘Why are you talking like this? What else can you talk about. If you want a man to stick his penis in you, yes you have the right to have it, yes you have the right to have it all, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You don’t have to have it or do you?’</p> <p>‘Please tell me what I have to do.’</p> <p>‘I don’t think it’s too much. Here take your trousers off. I’ll help you get started.’</p> <p>And with that and many more words, she took his trousers off and undid and unwrapped his belt and trousers and pulled them all the way off. She was in for a surprise. What she was going to do had already taken her to a new level of excitement.</p> <p>He was in the right place at the right time in her. How to go about this. Just have the penis inside of her.</p> <p>‘What is a penis? A penile.’</p> <p>Just in case: ‘A penis, a cock, a nice penis, a nice nice cock.’</p> <p>Now where did that come from? Why was it spoken so casually? This was not what I thought myself to be in bed with a man. Why was it said so casually that I’d find myself thinking it funny if I enjoyed having sex with a man. I rather than an old man. in bed and a man that night? He didn’d have had sex with what I had sex with a girl, a rather—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
