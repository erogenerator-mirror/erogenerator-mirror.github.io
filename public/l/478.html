The verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish</strong>-green sky.</p> <p>My head pounded in an effort to take control of the situation to see which of the four men was to be the most dangerous.</p> <p>The two young men stood facing the rain, leaning against the grass with their foreheads down.</p> <p>The man had blonde hair, and the other had sandy blond hair with curly bangs.</p> <p>The one was slimy. The other was a bit on the heavy side.</p> <p>The brunette had a face that drew your eyes to its lips.</p> <p>His eyes were dark with lust. His mouth was large. And as he neared me I looked up at him to see if he was watching my face through the rain. The one between his legs held the hand that was stroking over his cock out towards me.</p> <p>I was mesmerized. I wanted to reach out and grab the cock and feel it and know that that was about all a man could be.</p> <p>I had never met a man like that, and I wanted to know what it felt like to have his cock stroked. I wanted to know what it would feel like to have something bigger inside of me.</p> <p>I let my tongue run out of my mouth and run around a wet circle around my own cock.</p> <p>As I stared up at him I could feel his eyes on my cock.</p> <p>I watched as his hand ran down and ran up the length of his cock as it lengthened by his stroke. His hand felt powerful on his own.</p> <p>His fist tightened around it as he watched me intently.</p> <p>I reached out and took the cock into my hand.</p> <p>I could feel him throb in my hand as I slid my hand toward his waist.</p> <p>I felt his body tensing as I stroked toward his cock.</p> <p>I felt my own orgasm coming upon me as I slowly pulled at his erect cock.</p> <p>I let my hand glide up and down along the length of his cock as I looked up at him.</p> <p>His hand had moved to his side, watching the action on my cock.</p> <p>As much as he wanted to watch me jerking off he would also be a bit embarrassed to be jerking off his own son's friend.</p> <p>All of these feelings and feelings of power were all that the three of us could stand, and each of us would continue to do whatever this man did to the other.</p> <p>I opened my mouth slightly and put my lips over the head of his cock. After I had slid my lips over his cock I slowly slid down his cock as I looked up at him. His hands had slipped to the sides of my face to hold me in place as I slid down his cock.</p> <p>My son didn't try to hold back and he didn't pull away.</p> <p>His hands slid to his chest to keep from grabbing me.</p> <p>I could feel his body tensing as I inched my mouth down his cock.</p> <p>Slowly my lips slid down his cock. I could feel the thick veins along the length of his cock as they slipped along my lips. As I slowly slid my mouth down his cock his eyes closed as he gasped.</p> <p>His hands had slipped from his chest to my arms as his eyes shut and his head went back into the wet grass.</p> <p>My son's hands had slid to my face. His fingers wrapped around my cheeks as he had pulled away and stared at my mouth.</p> <p>I kept my eyes closed as I slid my hand down his cock. My lips touched his balls as I slid them down on his cock.</p> <p>His eyes had opened as his lips parted and his mouth had hung open.</p> <p>He had closed his eyes as his hips lifted, and was breathing heavily.</p> <p>I had let my hands slide down and over his flat stomach. One hand made its way up to his nipple.</p> <p>His moans were deeper and louder now as I felt his cock twitch and throb in my hand.</p> <p>My fingers were sliding down his cock as I pressed his flat stomach down towards his hips and felt his body raise it off the grass. His cock had jerked and jerked in my hand as I slid my mouth down his cock.</p> <p>Once I had the head, his eyes had opened even more as he had lifted his body off the ground, his back and shoulders now bent away slightly. He had now pressed forward slightly as they had done back when I held his cock. He had his eyes closed.</p> <p>He must have had his eyes closed because the rain had begun to flow down a bit heavier. . 's head had now tilted upwards slightly as it had risen from the other then had risen back down to the grass. could have turned the grass and back into the grass. with my mouth, just about 2 feet. He had gone as his hips were holding it. Once on the grass.
