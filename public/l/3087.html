There is</strong> something in Heaven. The last few days of his life he had dreamt of her and had even fantasized about her. Her eyes, so like his own, and her full red lips.</p> <p>Morn</p> <p>The two hours of light were long ago, the evening had come the day before her next anniversary. This is her life. Her life is perfect.</p> <p>Hurry into the bedroom She is naked and all ready for him. She walks in from the main bedroom. The two women in the room are already out of their clothes. The man is already in his robes, laying on the huge bed. She is all ready for him. He is a good looking 6” with short curly blond hair, almost black and just starting to grey. She has on the same green eyes which she always gets with the gold jewellery of the night. Her face is the same, beautiful, yet shy. She has an innocent face on her face, a boy’s smile is what she lets him see, there is no need to play it down, her cheeks are red, her nipples are already swollen making a big protuberance on their smooth skin. Her breasts, now they were just the right size and fullness is there, hard and small almost like he nipples. She never wears a bra, and there nipples are always hard and pointed. She was always so excited in the morning, when he started undressing her with his eyes she would let him play with her breasts and nipples, and caress them in his hands. She hated making him wait, now every morning she had to relieve him of the time it had taken to eat his breakfast. At the end of every day she would lay a big kiss on him while she was giving him a massage. He got the idea one day, to put his arms around her, and caress her as she lay on her stomach. He would slowly kiss her shoulders and neck, and he would move down to her breasts, kissing all her flesh and taking his time to suck her nipples. She would always let him kiss all the way down to her navel and her thighs. He would never do such to her this. He thought for hours, she never took his name. There were not a minute she felt uncomfortable, but now she got the whole night to last. But it could not last long, her legs are already stiff. The way he looked at her makes Morn so good for himself, she just has to give him a chance to fuck her again, even if he has to ask her about it she had to.</p> <p>She was all ready, her cunt lips swollen and red. She was not shaved, just a short black and gold chiffon that hides the dark places she had to hide in her body. She had the most wonderful cunt.

He saw her cunt lips were swollen and red. There was no doubt of her orgasm. She thought he had stopped. She then said that she was just happy for him to fuck her again.

When he saw him on the sofa he looked up to see the man in his naked nakedness with his big beautiful penis hanging, between his thighs in his hands, looking at Morn.</p> <p>This time she was the one doing the moving with him. She was just walking forward to the bed, her body was straight and her arms were long and long her head was bent backwards. Her hips were straight and her buttocks were rounded. Her legs were still spread and her cunt was open, waiting. Morn looked at his cock, which was dripping with his pre-cum. He moved forward a bit and stood at the end of the bed. He could see that her legs were wide open, and she turned onto her side and started putting all her weight onto her feet. Her back was straight and her long fingers and toes were spread wide, like she was going to give herself an orgasm.
