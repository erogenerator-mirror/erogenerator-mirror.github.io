Honour that which is chiefest and most powerful in the world, and</h4><p><strong>that is it, which makes use of all things, and governs all things. So also in thyself; honour that which is chiefest, and most powerful; and is of one kind</strong> with all things. You are able to perform anything you desire. It's all about enjoying what you can't. Enjoy.</p> <p>There are a huge number of people out there, in this world, for heaven's sake, whose sex life and the rest of their lives are all the fuckings they have in the world. The fact is it's what's known as a 'sexual revolution' (well, the people are all one big 'sex revolution' and one thing they're all for). But, alas, there's one real world exception to these things.</p> <p>You're not really looking for that, I know, it's just that... I am... and I am, and I am. Who's in it? No, I'm not. I've got some things on my mind, some things I've got to do before I can get it to work. So, anyway.</p> <p>So... just so you know, if you've got a job that you wanna work for; I'm sure you've heard of one and would like to see it. It's a one-time job; you can save, but it's not a life-altering experience. But that doesn't mean that you don't like the job. Just so you know, the first year of your 'career' is gonna be interesting, especially, shall we say, since most of the people in the department who work with you are single men and women, just like any job. But you can't really be happy about them, not any more than you can being with the woman you care a lot about all the time, but especially when that's the life of the guy that you love most. Of course there's certainly that chance that you won't be happy at all, but you could be, if you're single and you're a real one, which is possible at this point in your life. The fact is, in the long run what a girl really doesn't know and is too much to grasp. Besides, you'll get the best of it, you know. But, if you think you could, you know, do that, too, which you'll get. What am I, a guy who's got the biggest dick in the world, to answer your question?</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>The first time I told you, when I was in my early to mid sixties, there were some girls that I worked with, in a large department. I'm not really sure what it was. I've never really been one to talk about it to any women though, I think they're too young, but they've always been there and they've always been pretty, well, a bit of a hottie. But, it's been pretty tough. You know, I can relate for I feel I'm more honest, and more open minded than most other guys are, which is why I'm in this place. I don't usually come out of the room looking for sex, you know? Well, maybe a little, but I love women that are older than me in general. I can get a woman to go out every so often, sometimes. I enjoy looking at that body of hers.</p> <p>But, I also love older people. There's something about a woman that's so feminine and alluring that actually turns me on. A woman with a great body. And you're probably wondering what I'm getting at by this point, right? Well, yeah, as you probably have already guessed, I'm happily married with a good bit of experience in all of that stuff. Yeah, I've had sex with a few women in my day, but it's been mostly with women of my experience. I mean, there's usually been lots of 'em, and lots of them were pretty damn good, but there ain't a lot of 'em to compare.</p> <p>It's like, a lot more, isn't it? I'd call that a 'lot of them were good' and it's never a bad thing, you know? We've all got to measure our bodies, in a way: what we do with age, what we do with our partners and what we do with our spouse. And we just do that. And then we're doing the same. But, just to be perfectly honest, if you don't want to have sex with someone of your own ages you should definitely do it yourself or do something else. You know, do the deed without worrying about who else you're with, or even if they're you.</p> <p>The truth is you're not the only one who's had it with a few of the older women. I'll admit I can talk a little bit about it. There were some pretty slimy things between me and my ex-wife; she, I'm pretty certain. We never seemed to a certain parts, and that was her in my own mine.</p> <p></p> <p>Anyway, so you can I'dâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
