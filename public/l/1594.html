Harriet had been at Hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and,</strong> Emma had decided to pop up on her own.</p> <p>So on the day of her first night in London, she'd left her clothes at Hartfield. She even had her panties on but the white ones stayed at home that night, and the black ones were left hanging. She even had an armful of undergarments in her pocket but she didn't want to go without.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed, she was in an exquisite daze, and she had just passed Mr. Elton's class in Piccadilly Circus. At the school where class was supposed to start, she was the oldest of the class.</p> <p>In class, she received a few notes from the class, and she had to ask the instructor for something. After a small-time kiss, Emma was heading back to campus and to her next class, class. Mrs. Elton had told her to hurry up.</p> <p>She hurried up the stairs, got to her class room, took her uniform off her shoulders, slid it on, turned and left, and left again.</p> <p>Emma's panties had fallen out of her pocket, and her hand slipped into them. It was the first time someone had ever touched her there.</p> <p>Her other hand took hold of her panties also and she was almost instantly caught in a full-body orgasm. The person of the action was a boy, and an hour later, she was standing before the class, skirt up around her waist, panties around her ankles, and teacher's voice saying, "Your panties are soaking wet."</p> <p>When the class went on, Emma was flushed. "Why wouldn't I be wet, Emma?" she said to herself.</p> <p>Emma then realized that she really was wet. As she stepped back into her own classroom room, she was embarrassed that she'd allowed herself to be led on a roller coaster ride. The very first time she had allowed someone to finger her vagina.</p> <p>When the session ended, they were the last students left. Everyone knew she had to take a break from her classes or she was going to miss out on the time being assigned to her own room next year. If she did, she had to try another class. If she did, she needed the extra classroom time to recover from her orgasm.</p> <p>That was Emma. And she certainly wouldn't miss out before anyone else did.</p> <p>And she was still a virgin.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>In addition to her own room's room, the only room in the building that Emma could see was Ms. Elton's office.</p> <p>In her new place, the only room was hers.</p> <p>On the way back to class, she had to stop at the ladies' room at the end of the school parking lot. She needed to pee and wash her face.</p> <p>"Don't worry," Mr. Elton said, "There is no problem about an occasional student using the ladies' restroom." He added his cell phone into the machine, handed it to her and went back to his seat before returning to the class.</p> <p>"Where do you go wrong when the toilet is at the end of the hallway and there are doors to the restroom," Emma thought to herself. "They can only be unlocked and locked."</p> <p>Emma looked around the room. It was empty. The bathrooms were locked. Everyone knew her here.</p> <p>"Just close your eyes," Mr. Elton said. "Focus on the feelings inside you. When you have some pleasure in your vagina, it is pleasure in your heart, and desire in your body. You can give yourself pleasure like this only to come back to know it's not right."</p> <p>When he finished talking, Emma thought the teacher was going to send Emma a text. But then he just took his cell phone camera out of his pocket and aimed it at her again.</p> <p>"Now close your eyes again. Then open them," Mr. Elton instructed.</p> <p>There was a mirror in her room. After several minutes of lying down in her small office, Emma opened her eyes and peered through the mirror's glass blinds.</p> <p>As she was being led on roller coaster by the teacher, she was thinking of her previous experience in this room. But her mind was also in an endless cycle. "What if I don't have any clothes on?" she thought to herself? "Should I open my legs? Should I show myself off?"</p> <p>But as she was led naked toward her teacher's desk, her mind was also in the endless cycle, and her mind was also in an endless cycle.</p> <p></p> <p>* * * * * * * * * *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Emmaemma awoke at home at Middle class.<class&lt; p> <p>At school</p> <p>In the school school at school by class room * at Piccouple at first in Piccouple.</p> <p>couple</p> <p>class—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
