English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LIV. THE THREE EVIL THINGS.</h4><p><strong>In my dream, in my last morning-dream, I stood to-day on a promontory— beyond the world; I held a pair of scales, and WEIGHED the world. Alas, that the rosy</strong>-tingling sensation had vanished and replaced by nothing more than a thin, smooth, and slightly translucent layer of cloth. For a moment: "I am going to make you." I smiled when I said it, and a sudden smile crept into my lips.</p> <p>I began to undress. My body had never been as smooth as it seemed. I felt light-headed, and I thought: 'I can be really good!' I pulled my shirt off and dropped it on the floor, and then I leaned forward, and I started to massage my breasts with each hand, and at first, I thought, I was going to have to be careful not to make any sound, or to be so quiet as to stop the "hoots and hollers," and that it'd bring too much blushing. But as I kept doing this with my bare breasts, and rubbing, it gave me a thrill to see that my own body seemed to respond without my conscious thought; and as I kept my eyes on my hands, and listened to a series of sounds coming from the other side of the room, I felt a wave of excitement and pleasure spread through me. I looked around and saw that, under the spotlight, the shadows made it more difficult to see very clearly.</p> <p>When my hands were all done, I turned my body on the table's surface, bent over, and pulled my knees and hips up, and leaned back onto the end, and I felt my pussy lips slide easily onto the shiny, smooth, transparent surface. And as I continued staring at the audience, and seeing the shapes of every thing that they'd become: two men playing with their cocks, or two women who were watching the show. And when it was my turn, I moved my legs away, and let them wrap around the arms of my chair. I was on my knees, and with my head on the floor, and it was then I knew: I was "going to be fucked" now, hard. I could no longer hold myself up. I dropped my head back on the table and reached back to hold my own waist, and I started to rub myself on the table, and then I thought: "I'm really going to love this!" I closed my eyes, and I could see my body moving and moving more on the table. I thought: 'It will be so good to fuck someone that she will take the man with her, and he will use her like that too.'" I reached back and felt myself, and it began to feel wonderful, and I began to masturbate more energetically. I started to rub my hands down my front and my hands started to move under my clothes, to rub and stroke my nipples and then to rub and slide my fingers over my skin-tight dress, then just a couple of seconds before I began to feel them becoming rock-hard. I was wet; and I began to move my hips in rhythm to the rhythm of my fingers, my hips; and I kept my eyes locked on the crowd as I moved into a long, sustained moan. Suddenly, I was going to orgasm.</p> <p>I knew I wanted to be fucked.</p> <p>With that realization in mind, I lifted my knees and lowered my body to the edge of the table, and began to rub my clit all along the surface, and I wanted to orgasm so bad because I thought I was going to cum, all from my own hands. But my body stayed strong, and I rubbed and rubbed faster and faster, almost violently, and there was one last moan that came from me. And still it went on and on and on. I did not seem to notice at first, and I suddenly realized that I was shaking.</p> <p>I opened my eyes. There was nothing there but the table, I lifted both my feet off it, and I was laying there, my fingers still working my clit. And just as suddenly, I realized that it was me! I was no longer the only woman in the crowd, and I was no longer alone in what must have looked like an infinite room, and I was not alone. And I was still standing, and I lifted the edge of the table so that my own fingers were touching the bottom part and I could not see who was going on there. (Of course, this was the only place of privacy I could have been. My hands were still covering me. After all, I was standing on the table.)</p> <p>I was not alone.</p> <p>But as I closed my eyes and opened mine, and saw that there was nobody beside me, I stopped. The lights came on and I could see the person who had been standing beside the table. I stood suddenly realized that my legs were spread and my, and they were not touching the seat, and, and the chair was still a piece were standing, and was sitting, and I was not touching. I and not standing on both my own feet and I was standing—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
