Midnight Aloft.—Thunder and Lightning.</h4><p><strong>The main-top-sail yard.—Tashtego passing new lashings around it. “Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up here. What’s the use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don’t</strong> understand it, we can’t just go outside, you’ll see some lightning in the sky and you have to do it.”</p> <p>It was a difficult question, she couldn’t bring herself to say it, but she just wanted me to, it seemed like forever before I said yes. She was standing right next to me on this swing step where the sky could be seen, just right up ahead and down. “There,” I said, “there, where we are,” and I took off her jacket, dropping both to the floor. “Oooh so nice.” She had the cutest pink bra with the front cut-off shirt under. She unbuttoned it, and slipped the sleeves off her arms, just in time to get the shirt pushed off her arms. I pulled her titties up to meet the shirt and she just sighed and sighed and held them, then she just leaned over from having the shirt pushed down to the bottom of her tits, but she never removed the shirt.</p> <p>Finally, she looked right at me and put my fingers to her nipples, which were just at the top of her tits, and she started arching her back against my hand, moaning, arching her neck. “Oh, fuck you’ll be able to see us, you have to watch it,” she said, sounding desperate.</p> <p>She didn’t take long enough to reach down and start to stroke around my cock. “Oh yeah, I can see you like I can just about see everything, like right away,” she breathed.</p> <p>I got up and walked around behind her; I slipped my hands under her bra cups, and cupped her tits with them. She started breathing more heavily and she reached behind and pushed them apart; she felt so hot and heavy and heavy. They were so full and sensitive—almost like I was sucking on them, I thought to myself. I let one finger roll around her areola and started to kiss down to her neck, as I slid the bra down toward her bra straps. She made a noise, almost like a whisper.</p> <p>I slid that bra off without undoing my belt, and tossed it away to the wall. Her tits looked so great up in the moonlight, and I loved running my thumbs on them and caressing them. “Oh, that’s so nice,” she said, “don’t stop, mmm, it feels so fucking good. And you make me so hot,” she said as my hands went back to her tits. I bent in and kissed each of her nipples, then slid two of my fingers over her nipple to stroke her, it was like nothing she had ever done before. I kissed down again to her titty. “Oh, yeah, oh, god, your tongue feels beautiful, so fuck, please stop,” she said, and I did and kissed back up, down to her right nipple as I slid my fingers up to her other tit, and she held her tits together in a tight fist. “Oh, oh god, oh, uh, shit. I’m right on the edge, ooh, uh, god, do it again, please. Oh, don’t stop. I’m almost there, I don’t want it to end.” Her pussy was wet and hot and tight with her excitement running down from the tips of her tits. I pulled my fingers back to her neck, and she just whimpered; she was so fucking horny, I just wanted her all to myself. She was moaning a little more, and breathing faster, and in that moment, I kissed my way down to the side of her right tit, taking the nipple in my mouth, sucking it, my tongue on the tip of the whole nipple, then sucking and licking it very lightly again. As I did so, she just leaned against the wall as I flicked her nipple with my tongue.</p> <p>“Ohhhhhhhh, oh god, fuck yes, I’m getting close, I’m almost there, oh fuck, I’m coming, fuck me, just please touch me,” she squealed, “please, oh, please, please, touch me, please. Uh uh,” she was going crazy, her whole body tensed, and she was bucking hard against me, her right hand on my head and it was all I could do to stay in her, my hand moving very slowly up and down. ‘ my cock as her moans got louder and louder, and louder and faster. I got her nipple in my tongue on the top side on the left. I started at attention, feeling just a little tahpussy at the right and up my middle, and it as my tongue on her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
