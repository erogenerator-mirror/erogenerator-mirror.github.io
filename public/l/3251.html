English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>L. ON THE OLIVE-MOUNT.</h4><p><strong>Winter, a bad guest, sitteth with me at home; blue are my hands with his friendly hand-shaking. I honour him, that bad guest, but gladly leave him alone. Gladly do</strong> as I must to have such fun. And I do with him, indeed.</p> <p>So, that was that. What happened next, I can't recall. Not really, I guess. There was that first kiss. His warm mouth covering my lips. His hot tongue invading my mouth. And then we were lying together on the couch, kissing and exploring one another again.</p> <p>I'd been a student at University and they were right by my front door, when I'd returned from classes. I'd dropped my backpack on a chair at my desk. I'd seen a man, lying there in all his naked glory, and he'd been naked, too. He had on a condom. No, that's a rather lame term, when compared to a man's dick, and to be honest, my ex, I'm a bit shocked at the amount of cock that was being sucked by that man, too - and that man was on all fours, his ass in the air as a male in heat.</p> <p>I'd loved that. I'd even allowed myself to touch his dick and balls, so that it was all right.</p> <p>His ass clenched. I could feel his dick sliding against my thigh. My heart was thumping in my chest. I had to be careful not to touch him. But I did, and that was the only touch that I would do anything, not unless it was for myself. I really wouldn't touch that man unless I wanted to.</p> <p>His dick was warm and wet in my hand, and I could smell it. It smelled musky, strong and sweaty. I could just imagine what his balls must feel like with my hand around them, and if I took off the condom, he'd be really horny, and he'd be my first for taking him to bed - my first fuck as a man.</p> <p>I could taste him there. He'd tasted me everywhere on his tongue, I remembered, and I could remember tasting the condom that was on my hand.</p> <p>And he was a woman. His dick was sticking out there. I could see it, like a huge dick in a woman's hand, and I knew that I was in for pleasure. The big man on the couch was fucking that man from behind, and I loved that too. The man's big cock looked ready to be sucked, and I loved the idea of being the first to get my first penis stuffed in that hot hole.</p> <p>There was a knock at the door, too. Did he see it? I just looked at the door, but he didn't say anything, and I was afraid he didn't want me to walk in and see that I walked in nude. Oh fuck.</p> <p>This was it. I got back into position, taking my cock in my hand again. I was hard again. The condom left me wet and ready to go again. I couldn't believe I'd been thinking about it while taking a condom, because this time, the anticipation had gone completely out of bounds, and not from my sexing thoughts to my head. I was hard again, and I had to have him, and I was ready.</p> <p>I had another condom on. They told me this was the best time to have unprotected sex. Did the men expect me to wear a condom? That I wasn't really on the pill?</p> <p>I went down and sat on his legs, and looked at him. He was getting on his knees, looking up at me with a smile. We kissed, more passionately than anything else. I felt so safe. I put my hand between us, feeling the full length of him, then I moved it up. My breath caught, and I felt his dick getting even bigger, so thick that it looked like steel. I reached both up and found a dick on either side of him - one for each leg, standing on both side. I looked at both him and myself, both watching, then I turned my face to mine and looked him up and down, seeing us both looking at him. He knew it, too. He took the condom off, and rolled it off; I wanted that dildo inside of me. As soon as he got it onto me, I felt it sliding into me: my legs being wide open wide in an instant, and all my drugged excitement was centered on his dick. It felt incredible. I reached down, pulled my legs open even further and slid that big dildo into me, and then I felt it entering me.</p> <p>That dildo, it felt incredible to be filled by something so big, so powerful. I felt like my knees had gone to jelly, and I couldn't hold that giant dick at all the way inside of my tight little body, stretched around his dick. I could only. That fat dick and push in and hold the rest inside out. That big cock and all that dick. And hold and hold, just hold.
