The Lobster Quadrille</h4><p><strong>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs</strong> escaped. After a moment, it became a mantra. "I...just do it, you idiot."</p> <p>"Fuck? Fuck? Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck fuckfuckfuck FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!" It was the phrase for the person who'd just fucked a woman and couldn't get her out of bed. The only word she'd ever managed to form came out of her mouth. This was the only word. "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"</p> <p>"You have an amazing pussy!" Alice whispered. She leaned in and kissed him on the forehead.</p> <p>The two sat on the couch and kissed some more. Her lips were soft and pliant, and their softness and warmth filled his mouth with electricity. A feeling of passion swirled through his senses as she kissed him and she sucked on his tongue.</p> <p>She knew he really enjoyed it when she was so aggressive, and had made it her goal to take him down a notch. Her mouth moved from his lips, past his chin to his neck, and then, in slow sweeping motions across him. A feeling so powerful she forgot to breathe.</p> <p>Alice broke the kiss and stared down at him. The smile on her face was a work of genius. Her lips pressed against his was beautiful and she was absolutely dripping wet. At that moment she was so much like Denny Jones, she thought.</p> <p>He'd always loved to feel Alice inside him. She'd always brought out the worst in him, and that was why he'd started using his hands the first time she started fucking him. She'd been so insistent about being fucked by the dabbler she had fallen in love with, that it didn't take long to find out what that meant.</p> <p>And that wasn't like you. She'd used him to bring a girl around, and there had been a lot of "cocksucking" that went on. But she'd never stopped until she tried it with the dabbler she had fallen in love with, and had succeeded to get her own dabbler, even though it wasn't any woman she'd had the pleasure of meeting.</p> <p>As Alice kissed him, she ran her legs up and down his legs. "I love the feel of your soft cock in my pussy." She kissed his face and ear as she caressed his arms and shoulders. "My ass is the best part."</p> <p>He looked back at her. She was looking at him with big, lidded eye lids, and her mouth was moving again on his neck, sending little jolts of electricity through his veins. It had been a long time since he had felt anyone's attention like that. "I would go back on birth control."</p> <p>"Don't you mean 'sperm injection'?"</p> <p>The question made her giggle and he pulled back, smiling. "It just happened." He kissed her and she kissed him back.</p> <p>Then he realized what they were doing and grinned and laughed. "You're a natural red head!" He winked at her and Alice blushed a tiny bit.</p> <p>"I've already had a couple of guys!"</p> <p>"Don't you worry."</p> <p>"But it is so awkward!"</p> <p>"I don't really think so."</p> <p>Her eyes danced around his. She really didn't want to know what he was going to do. She was so excited and was not sure he'd be able to stop. Her heart was beating and she couldn't speak...and she really didn't want to. She liked his idea, but it was way out of character.</p> <p>He kissed and licked his way down her neck, pausing to flick her nipples with his tongue. She groaned and pushed against him, and then she felt herself starting to come when she felt his cock touch her ass. She'd known that part of what it meant to be fucked by a dick had to be a man's cock. But it really was like a cock. It was hard, it was huge, and it made her moan. He felt the same thing, but his was much different from anyone's. His cock did something like a piston. But the effect of it was different.</p> <p>He leaned further down, and started pushing slowly, building his speed and force. She wrapped her arms around his waist and pulled him to her. She didn't want to give herself away. She had always imagined it as if sex would never come, except that in her fantasies she had always experienced different feelings. She'd never felt that she would be totally alone, and she wanted to feel it again.</p> <p>In some way she felt like she was just waiting to cum. She didn't want to wait, but she wanted this time. just to come, and it felt right. He'd feel something else again. He was waiting. She didn't really. But the way or she wanted to hold her bodyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
