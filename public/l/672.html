After his liberation he</strong> had felt it was worth it, but now, after his incarceration, he felt no more connected.</p> <p>When he was a Boy Scout, the only thing he remembered was the memories of his childhood.</p> <p>"So...do you always forget that?" he asked rhetorically.</p> <p>"I...yes," she said.</p> <p>"Well, that's why I like it so much. It's like I'm the only thing in your life."</p> <p>"And...I'll remember that too." she smiled.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"I'm going to sleep," she said as she walked into the suite.</p> <p>"I know," he said as he sat back on the bed.</p> <p>She stood in front of him and slowly stripped her gown down. Her body was perfect, except for the few details that he had missed. He would never want to be with one again, but right now all of that mattered was enjoying her body.</p> <p>"You know...about the time you were sixteen, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "All my girlfriends wanted to be with me. But I wanted it to be with you. Do you want to know what I was thinking all of those years?</p> <p>"Yes," she replied.</p> <p>"Well, I was thinking about our last year together," he said.</p> <p>"When you were sixteen?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "And that's why we're together."</p> <p>"I'm glad you feel like that," she said.</p> <p>"I don't."</p> <p>She grabbed him by the waist and slowly lowered herself onto his lap.</p> <p>As she straddled his hips he felt his cock start to harden. She rubbed herself against him. She felt so wonderful.</p> <p>"I'm so happy to be married to you," he said, and he knew he was.</p> <p>"It's too soon, but I'm having a hard time making sense of it all," she said. "And it feels so good."</p> <p>She started to kiss her way down his chest. He reached out and gently touched her hair, feeling its softness.</p> <p>She was getting closer to his cock. He didn't remember how he felt earlier, before. But he was sure she was going to be good.</p> <p>She slowly took her tongue down his belly, stopping each time at the top of his shaft. Then she licked her way back up. He felt her tongue circling the head of his cock.</p> <p>"I never knew what it felt like to have a cock," she said.</p> <p>She wrapped one hand around his shaft and gently stroked it.</p> <p>She was so gentle and so good.</p> <p>Then she took the head of his cock into her mouth. He couldn't believe it was happening. He felt a wave of euphoric pleasure rush through his body as he felt her head start to go down. And her head was enveloping his cock.</p> <p>All of a sudden he was there, but only because she started to move her head up and down, trying to get him to cum. The combination of all of the physical pleasures they experienced were enough to send him over the edge.</p> <p>He grabbed her waist and pushed her head down even harder as his hot cum exploded into her mouth. She didn't choke and she didn't choke, but she did spit his cum out over her stomach. She held on as he continued to spew his seed in her mouth, but he didn't want his cum to end.</p> <p>Finally, they both caught their breath, and he gently squeezed her shoulders while she was still trying not to choke on his cock. He held her face in his hands, his head on her neck.</p> <p>"I love you," he said to her.</p> <p>"I love you also," she repliedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
