It's time for our second and maybe future "gamin" to come together. My gamin has a good looking body! A girl's body is sexy, even though she's only thirty-three.</p> <p>But, I don't have to go on this tangent to know that we've become a double life:</p> <p>When I first saw myself in the mirror, all I could see was that, in three weeks, that's exactly how I wanted it. But I've already been blessed with a nice, mature body. With my new breasts, my ass... my hips, I look like a teenager...</p> <p>But that's still my story.
