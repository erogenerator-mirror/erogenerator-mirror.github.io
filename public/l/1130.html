He resolved to make an</strong> exception in the event of his own demise. He went to his room to dress up for his date with a couple of college colleagues and decided to just take a nap before he came back to bed.</p> <p>He felt the mattress dip as his head fell in; a few seconds before he heard the sound of someone moving against the wall of his room, he did not even notice what was happening till later that night when he was laid on his back and heard somebody talking. He was startled to hear that the voice belonged to a woman's voice. He did not want to become the prey to this woman who wanted him to submit to her but he also knew that he did not dare take this woman by force. He heard her speaking in a very calm voice and, once he realized she did not want be heard, he went stiff and sat up immediately.</p> <p>A few minutes later, while her back was to him, he felt it move down along his body till it reached his cock. Her small shoulders were touching his skin, her hair was being brushed with the back of her hand, she held his cock firmly as she leaned forward and began to suck on his cock. Suddenly, without any warning, she raised her head and said, "You will make me cum soon. Now we must get rid of our clothes."</p> <p>The other man's breath caught in his throat as he stood naked with what little clothing he had left in his room. Both women looked in astonishment and both men were in shock. One of them had a towel wrapped around her body, covering the modesty of her ample breasts. The other woman didn't care because she was naked and she was talking a lot about what came next. The other said, 'I can't believe he is even hard. He will never be able to perform.'</p> <p>"A woman can't do that to a man!" she said in a serious voice</p> <p>"I had no idea that men were that big a man. I have always had fantasies about women with big breasts." One of the men replied.</p> <p>"Well, let me know how the other thinks of it. We can talk more later." She replied in a seductive voice while looking at him, taking his cock in her hand. "I would like both of you to fuck me next time!"</p> <p>The other man, Gavroche, was shocked to see that women were talking with him; he turned beet red as he felt so ashamed of his own weakness as he looked at them.</p> <p>"So, this is it, we really will do it," one of the women said.</p> <p>"Ofcourse we will! There is more where that came from. What do you say? Are you willing to submit to me willingly?"</p> <p>"Of course I am."</p> <p>She raised one foot and let the towel fall down, covering them both. Gavroche went to the other men, his body trembling from excitement as he stared at the beautiful woman and their big breasts that he saw every evening. Suddenly he felt another hand on him and the other woman spoke.</p> <p>"How big is your cock, Gav?"</p> <p>"I don't believe that I am supposed to say, but thank you in advance." Gavroche replied.</p> <p>"Don't worry. I know my friend's size. He will soon be bigger than you are, maybe even bigger than the last one."</p> <p>"Wow, you really do get it up here sometimes." He noted.</p> <p>"You heard the other woman. I want to get your cock to match mine, so I can do it in front of you," she smiled.</p> <p>Without any hesitation, both men stood up, taking the other by hand, walking behind her. They took their places in front of her, taking their time while the other waited before them. Gavroche slowly, slowly moved down her body and kissed her on the lips. All the while, she had her hand rubbing his cock while the other man took his time kissing her breasts. Gavroche moved down her body slowly again until he reached her pussy and slowly licked up the length of her lips; he made some effort to take her clit in his mouth and did it several times until her hips were grinding themselves.</p> <p>After another few minutes, both men took their time, kissing her legs, thighs, the inside of her thighs while making slow moves toward their goal. Gavroche was kissing her lips and slowly moving downward toward the waiting tip of her cock. He stopped when his face was closer to her vagina, looking into her eyes while he slowly began to move back and forth against her with his hips. She gasped and when she noticed his cock was completely hidden from him. She said, "What's you don't you know how big cock can do it will be hard to match. " with this one of his hands."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Yes—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
