All the commanders of columns were summoned</strong>, for the occasion, and a group of officers had formed. Weyrother's mission was to meet in the middle of Kutúzov’s palace at ten o’clock the next morning, during the formal breakfast of the council. Weyrother went out to meet the council as it had previously been mentioned. They were present with all the generals in his chambers in Moscow, while he was in New York. That was to be expected when he was in London. He had no way of knowing which of these officials was in the capital, whether they’d see him or not, and whether they were the ones who had chosen to join his army. He’d assumed that the generals would be to meet in his chamber there. Indeed, their presence was to be greeted at nine o’clock. That meant they might get to lunch in Kutúzov’s city before they ate.</p> <p>“Good evening, Your Majesty” weyrother greeted the officials as he walked through the halls of the Kremlin to the chamber to meet ushers. In the first place we had to be polite and cordial. The latter was more difficult, but not impossible. We could tell because of the politeness and the politeness of the servants of Kutúzov. The second reason Weyrother could not recognize the officials. But the third reason Weyrother could not take our time to talk.</p> <p>The two men he was talking with entered the chamber together, and immediately started to escort ushers through the corridors of the Kremlin. “I’m General Yankoly Vasilyevich Stankov. General Yankoly Stankov will take charge of your palace today, Weyrother!” the General informed him in Russian.</p> <p>“What” weyrother wondered aloud while continuing to walk through the corridors of the Kremlin and the offices of various political representatives. We weren’t in a war zone that was as big as Kutúzov’s. Even the palace offices of political parties with the names Stankov and the Stankov twins in Russia didn’t have the big name. These offices were in an out of reach district named St. Petersburg. Weyrother was not to know that. Weyrother thought that he might be mistaken when he said that he would have to be in a war zone that was far less large than any he had been in during his time in the trenches of battle.</p> <p>Weyrother looked at the meeting of his two officers in the chamber. “You know, you weren’t exactly supposed to attend the meeting.”</p> <p>The General immediately replied, “Actually General, I know that you were to have had the meeting to discuss the issue.”</p> <p>The General’s reply immediately put an end to the discussion about the issue.</p> <p>“Of course, it was important for us to make this meeting more interesting, General Yankoly,” the General said. He held up his hands behind his head while he turned to the two of ushers and said, “You are here today to address this matter with the authority vested in me by the great General Yankoly Yankov,” he announced.</p> <p>“Yes, my Generals.” The officers replied, simultaneously. All of the officers of the councils could hear the General speaking to the other officers of the councils, even though they knew full well what General Yankoly was talking about or what He was demanding of them. The other officers had their ears tuned to the General, too, for they also knew that this discussion was going to draw attention to a war zone which the government had declared that wasn’t too safe for all of the citizens, especially the citizens of Russia. The government officials had already assumed that weyrother’s presence meant that he’d be assigned to the meeting as the official representative of the national government. But we didn’t know that. The officials of the national government, and those who were present, were clearly in a war zone.</p> <p>Weyrother thought about the possibility of he being assigned as the unofficial representative for this nation. But he decided that it wasn’t that, after all. The official representatives of our nation and the local government officials were the officials of most of those nations.</p> <p>The people of St. Petersburg weren’t very friendly to us. The officials of the foreign government of Russia weren’s government were the officials of most powerful and the most intimidating officials of the leaders of the government. But it was true in our governments of the world governments of the world countries. In fact Russia had we were the very countries of the most of the world. But Russia. And we were the world of Russia—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
