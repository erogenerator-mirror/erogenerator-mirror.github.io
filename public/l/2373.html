Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square</strong> in an endless circle. He had taken my virginity and it wasn't the first time. This was an experience that took me to the heights and I felt like I'd just died and gone to heaven. My body responded to him even as it was under a man's control. I thought that I was the luckiest girl ever in the world. We fucked over and over and over again until we had exhausted our carnal needs. We fucked in every conceivable position, position and position until we came together once again. For a lifetime I felt like he was my first. I just felt my desire for him growing.</p> <p>Now, not only was I the third man to ever do to me what I believed I would do to Bill Clinton or Harry. I felt liberated and liberated and I was going to see this man again. That evening I felt safe with him and I was ready for anything but sex. At bedtime he seemed a little uncertain. He put on a t-shirt and shorts. His penis was flaccid. I didn't know whether to feel uncomfortable or excited by what he had just done to me. Then he moved closer still. In an almost conspiratorial whisper I had said "I want to make love to you." This time he kissed me. His penis moved in my hand. I was so aroused that he went from semi-erect to rigid in a second. I was in heaven.</p> <p>He lay down beside me and we embraced. It was like I had never been kissed before. It was a tender and passionate kiss. I felt his desire. I was in a new place and I let it be. He rolled onto his back and we embraced. He was lying on his back. I reached for his cock, which it was still flaccid. I wrapped my hand around it and pulled it upward. It sprang up from my hand and it didn't look small at all. I began to rub it up and down. We kissed. It was a long, gentle, tender kiss with lots of sexual connotation. His cock was big and thick. It was pulsing. I slid my hand up and down. He felt wonderful. I wanted so much to suck him but I was afraid, afraid that he may try to enter me. It would have been awkward doing this with an erection but I was so horny that I just couldn't. "Take off your robe," he said after a few minutes.</p> <p>We were so intent on each other that we hadn't heard our spouses come into the room. It was late. He was still lying on his back, his cock standing straight up. It was hard.</p> <p>"Do you want me?" I asked.</p> <p>"I want you." He said. "I want you. I want to feel your body."</p> <p>He moved closer so that our bodies were almost directly on top of each other. I put my hand around it and gently stroked it. It felt like soft hairless flesh. I wanted to feel it in my mouth. And there was room for both of us. It was as hard as rock and just as hard. I felt like my heart would burst out of my chest. I felt as if I was going to faint. I didn't want to but as soon as I did he stopped me. "You have to put it in me. We can't do that." I said.</p> <p>He put his penis up to his belly as we both rolled over until I was on top. I rubbed his cock all over both of us, enjoying the feeling of it in the palm of my hand. He was so hard and he felt as good as his cock. I could feel it inside of me. It felt as good as my pussy.</p> <p>I took his penis in my mouth and began sucking at its bottom. It felt as good as Bill Clinton's penis. It was as long and wide as Bill's was. With every suck I could feel it's stiffness begin to disappear before he could pull it out. Every so often I pulled it out in order to feel the full effect of it in my mouth.</p> <p>I felt his hands reach down and find my breasts. He began pulling and pinching my nipples as I continued sucking his penis. His hands were all over my body as he pinched them. I got the impression of squeezing his penis but it wasn't painful. It felt wonderful. I took every inch of his shaft in the mouth, all the way to the back of my throat. It felt better than Bill's dick. My mouth was filled to capacity and there could be no more.</p> <p>I took his penis from my mouth and licked the head of it like a lollipop. I savored every taste of the taste as I stroked him gently, licked my tongue along his shaft, played under his head and then took that spot in my mouth again. There was a big cock. It was my best feeling to make love.
