Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship: it began with a prayer built</strong> in to our beloved uncle Tim. So we had the rest of the day, when we would be able to be free from the chaos of our family and its chaos, free from the guilt that followed us to the city.</p> <p>The day before, as always, my uncle Tim was a busy man: working for his business and his brother Charles, who now had a degree-level office in town as well as his office and research center, but with other things like the law book-entry, and the internet, though I couldn't put it off for several long hours, with Charles being the only guy.</p> <p>It was a day I remember well because after supper on the bus at around 10:15, which was no time whatsoever, I sat behind my mom's desk at the local library watching Charles from the computer chair I had been sitting behind. He had done an outstanding job of distracting us, and the thought that I was a good looking lady sitting there suddenly brought on a tingling that was just perfect for me. It was then I saw a familiar face at the front of the classroom.</p> <p>My heart was racing; my body was alive with a sensation that was more beautiful, and for the first time in years, so much more sexual, than I had ever felt before. I looked over at my uncle Tim.</p> <p>"What are you doing, sir--"</p> <p>"I think it's time for a study project so we don't get into trouble, sweetheart. What's with the old dummies?" His voice was low and husky, his fingers running lightly through his silky blonde hair.</p> <p>I turned bright red, and blushed, trying to avoid eye contact with my uncle Tim, but unable to stop myself, or even stop being so sexually attracted to him. "Yes." I responded slowly, not wanting to be caught gawking at his dick or how long he had. "It looks like you're doing okay, sir, too. What do you want me to see? We need to go to the board meeting tomorrow; it's about this new model of software."</p> <p>My uncle Tim raised his hand to interrupt my statement, but I quickly put it in his lap, giving him another quick squeeze and turning back around. As we were leaving, I asked, "Sir, do you want me to have that lesson now?"</p> <p>"No. We can discuss it in the morning, if that's okay with you."</p> <p>"Of course, sir." I stood up quickly, and walked towards the door; my eyes never leaving the bulge that showed in his board-entry shirt. I had to know; I had to give him a kiss, or kiss him good-bye. I took my time, and knocked two times, and finally got a response. "You're sure? Yes, yes, yes, thank you, sir."</p> <p>And I was gone. The next morning was a big day for Charles' company, and I saw him first thing as always. After I was finally dressed, he came home with me, and I felt like I was in love, something I was not able to believe I could do; but something that made me want to make it all my own.</p> <p>It looked like Charles' house was ready, or rather Charles, and I couldn't wait to get to Charles house and find out if they were the same person. I also couldn't wait to see if the next day was like this. I had to know what they were all about. We had agreed to make the most of our vacation, and I was determined to find out from them whether my uncle Tim wasn't a good enough name, or whatever. The thought that the last day I could not do something was overwhelming for me, and the thought that Charles was going to have that study project was equally overwhelming for me: I had to try this, even if only on its own, I had to get it out of the way.</p> <p>I wanted to stay late in class; I wanted to study, and when Charles came home early, I'd be alone with him. I took a deep breath, and walked to the office to get ready for my next class. I got a surprise when I stopped by Mrs. Cott-Vickers’ office while she was taking her lab notes, and came back with her papers. I had no doubt that she would approve if nothing else was revealed, but the moment I saw Charles' eyes open, I knew for certain that something was happening between them.</p> <p>I took a deep breath, and walked past Mrs. Cott-Vickers’s office, and entered through the front door that I always-closed one which only did. I do so on Fridays to study. I can lock the door. She closed it. I do. I did what ever so do. And I always do I have to study her.
