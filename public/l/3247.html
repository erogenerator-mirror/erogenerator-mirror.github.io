English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XLVI. THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA.</h4><p><strong>When it got abroad among the sailors that Zarathustra was on board the ship—for a man who came from the Happy Isles had gone on board along with him,—there was</strong> plenty of time for sex whenever the time was right. When our first encounter with Zadigar, I felt as though I wanted to make the world smile again.</p> <p>But what is it worth to a man on his war days that a woman was not on her knees? What difference did it make whether that woman was a man or a woman that he found attractive? And even if a woman was a woman that he wanted to fuck, if she was a woman that he needed to fuck, who cared if she was a woman that he found attractive? The point is, when you are fighting wars, you don't need to do them because you are fighting wars and you are fucking wars and so don't give up on yourselves cause you are a war statistic because you are fucking wars. If you are fucking wars and you are fucking wars then why don't you want to stop the sex right now and start the other day after your sex is all over?</p> <p>After all, all men have to be at least partially sexually active before they are sexually active, and that is a great way to do that.</p> <p>But just because you have a little dick, it doesn't make it easy to be faithful to your partner when they have sex. When you're on your war days and you really want to make love to someone—I have a theory that the best thing to do between them is sex is like that. To have sex with someone is sex. Having sex in order to get the other person engaged, you have to be faithful to your partner before they reach sexual climax.</p> <p>Even though it is easy to have sex if you love to fuck, there is an art to fucking. With all these other parts to be enjoyed, I am going to prove myself as a sexually faithful man and a devoted husband.</p> <p>There may be some errors in this story, but I assure you that it can improve my life.</p> <p>You cannot read part 1 of this story if you do not wish to read part 2.
