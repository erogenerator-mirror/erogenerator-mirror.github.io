It was time for me to return to the time when I lost my parents, with everything being so far behind us. It was time for me to start over.</p> <p>I got up from my desk chair and went out to the garage. While walking though into the front door, I took off my coat, hung it neatly in the closet, and set it down on my lap. I got one more look at the outfit I was planning on wearing. There were still three buttons in the skirt, and one button was still undone halfway up. My mind wandered to these events as I dressed, but I didn't really know the outfit to fit well. It made me wish I could get a more exact picture of it.</p> <p>I took off my coat, walked back into my bedroom that used to be my bedroom, and picked up my clothes. As I went over one more time, I decided not to bring the top button out and see if it looked perfect. I left the top button undone, but left the bottom button open for the slightest hint of my cleavage. I picked up my clothes and put them neatly away at my old bedroom closet: clothes, shoes, and socks.</p> <p>I went back into the living room and sat down. I started the game in the living room.</p> <p>"Hang on, it's time for a change of clothes!" I exclaimed. I picked up my phone and started the game.</p> <p>"Where did you get those?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, well there was this guy you said liked to buy her shoes from the Internet."</p> <p>"You should have bought that!"</p> <p>"Oh yes, I should have, but I couldn't get him before I was too busy."</p> <p>"So what kind of shoes do you usually buy?"</p> <p>"Well there's a black, shiny one."</p> <p>"What about a white one?"</p> <p>"Oh no, a white blouse. I buy white shirts."</p> <p>"Ah, there's a difference in that. A black shirt."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because it looks sexy on you."</p> <p>"Well, I'm still not getting the picture!"</p> <p>"No it's okay. What do you want?"</p> <p>"I don't know. Just don't tell me."</p> <p>"Then I don't think that's a good enough choice."</p> <p>"Why would you say that, I love it!"</p> <p>"Well, it's not that. It doesn't sound as sexy as it does."</p> <p>"Why doesn't it feel sexy, but it's too old?"</p> <p>"It feels sexy on you, but it's too old to be sexy as it does," I replied.</p> <p>"Oh no, that's not true. It's too sexy."</p> <p>"Well, you won't have a choice. Now just take off the skirt."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"Now take off the skirt. I want you to take the first button off in that white blouse." I took the blouse off, and then tossed it to the side. From the left pocket opened up one button above the first button, with one hand, using the thumb of my other hand on top of the button. I turned the shirt around to the other leg, turned myself toward the center of the game, and lowered both the top button until I had a right inch of the left button completely hidden from view. I left the button opened all the way up, so to speak, just a little, for an extra effect, and then, with one free hand, pulled the material to my knees until it was almost to my hips. Then I pulled up the shirt so the front of both sides of my nipples became visible, and raised my arms up over my head in the requisite way. I turned the shirt back around, and set it in the air on my lap, as if I was doing a pose for the camera.</p> <p>"Now, let me see. Turn sideways on the couch while you sit down." I turned sideways on the couch and brought my feet up to the top of the couch cushion. I set my laptop screen down and sat down on the couch. I brought my feet behind my head while I waited for the game to finish. I leaned over closer to the laptop and pretended to be watching the movie.</p> <p>"Oh, that looks like fun." I looked to the laptop. "Do you wanna see the movie?"</p> <p>"No, I don't watch it's the movie."</p> <p>I look, but I don't see what, I don't watch."</p> <p>I watch I watch' but watch," I can't watch but don't watch but I don't watch but watch."</p> <p>but don't watch but don't watchâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
