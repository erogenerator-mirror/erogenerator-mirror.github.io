English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XXXV. THE SUBLIME ONES.</h4><p><strong>Calm is the bottom of my sea: who would guess that it hideth droll monsters! Unmoved is my depth: but it sparkleth with swimming enigmas and laughters. A sublime one</strong>! Laughter. You do not want to have a full meal; eat first? If you really feel it; it means "it was me!"</p> <p>You're the reason we eat at noon-afternoon with one of our neighbors' families for lunch. You're the reason we do homework at ten after school and then come to one of our neighbors' houses for food, and you're the reason we live in this house (for that reason, I have some very strong rules, and that's how you do them). You can sleep there if it is raining (and there are no children in the house), and you can do it any of your homework if it's raining only when the lights are off: or just if the weather's so good that it's raining, and everything in the house's spot is spotless.</p> <p>Hmmm. Well. It's true though. We don't need one of our neighbors (but that's a subject I've had much time to think about). I'm glad your family lived near us and I really like you. I'm pleased you're enjoying your new job, or we might both get arrested and killed.</p> <p>This is an easy one. All you need is a little background - you know how it works. But it's a lot easier when you know what people expect to be able to expect - because most of the time when we talk about it, we just end up with, "I don't know, but do like you were happy to sleep on the couch" or "I can sleep on the couch now; I like it better when you're asleep anyway!". That's pretty awesome! You make us so happy with those happy noisesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
