I have tried to follow as closely as possible the</strong> previous chapters and keep that up. Enjoy, everyone!</p> <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p> <p>Note to reader: I have tried to edit the previous chapters of each category to a minor length. Each reader will note that I have decided to take my time, editing the entire story into a single story-book after the initial chapters. There is a chance that there may even be some spelling errors, so that will not bother.</p> <p>I hope you had as enjoyable a bath as I did last night and I look forward to more of this next month, especially if everyone's had fun with the story so far.</p> <p>Chapter 5 - Day Five</p> <p>"Come on! We're going to be late," Jason called from a darkened doorway.</p> <p>"But, I love you!" I told him as I put my arms around him and gave him a big kiss.</p> <p>"Jason!" I yelled into his mouth. "You don't know how hot this makes me getting you in bed with a hard on!" He was already hard as a rock. I grabbed him by the waist, pulling him onto me. His cock was fully at attention and it was pulsating as I rubbed my clit against it.</p> <p>"I want to do this all night long," he whispered into my ear as he kissed me passionately.</p> <p>"And just like I did last night," I replied back. "This morning." He looked up at me with lust in his eyes. He wanted me.</p> <p>"Mmmmm..." It was a question that I couldn't answer. It was a surprise, but he knew that.</p> <p>"This morning!" he answered back and kissed me again.</p> <p>"Jason, please, we need to be early," I whispered into his mouth with him. I had barely gotten a word out as we broke the kiss and looked at each other.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?" Jason asked. I turned my face to him and looked him directly in the eyes.</p> <p>"Tell me what you want."</p> <p>"Make love to me," he responded. I reached down and unbuttoned his shirt as he was pulling me out of my bathroom. I stripped his shirt off, then ran my hands all over his muscles as they were beginning to harden again, even though he was still a little aroused. I started kissing my way down his chest as he looked at me. "Do you want to kiss me down there, honey? I know you want to. I know it's turning you on. But you just have to find out more."</p> <p>"I do," Jason replied. He pushed me back on the bed and took his time. Finally reaching my pussy with his face, he lowered his face down to it, kissing the puckered edges. A little thrill of excitement ran through me. First he kissed me there, then the insides of my pussy. He moved his tongue between my lips and rubbed it all around. As he got excited, he brought his mouth to my clit and started sucking it and gently flicking it. I was surprised at his gentleness in getting me as excited as he was. His attentions made me feel so sexy as I looked at him and looked down at him. I wanted him to know that he could bring me to an orgasm the same way he did last night. I wanted him to remember that. I just wanted him to give me a moment. I wanted to feel him inside me as he had last night.</p> <p>"Jason, I want to do something. I want all of you in me!" I begged him in the dim candle light. He looked at me and kissed me again. "Jason. I need you to be inside me so badly!" I begged him again.</p> <p>He reached behind me, taking his pants off in the same slow motion and they slipped down to the floor. He held his rigid cock before me, as he looked at me and said, "Do you want me to make love to you? Please?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I replied and I felt his cock slip inside my pussy. It felt incredible as he pushed it in until he could go no further. It was such a turn-on to have him inside me and I wanted to cum again already. "Please," I repeated.</p> <p>"I love it when that happens. Tell me what you want me to do now."</p> <p>"Jason, I want you to make love with me." I leaned back and looked at him. "Make love to me," I said again.</p> <p>"OK," he answered.</p> <p>"Make me cum with you!" I asked him. "You know it's gonna be special."</p> <p></p> <p>I want it. I need it, Jason." I told him. I begged him. "Make me cum with you.
