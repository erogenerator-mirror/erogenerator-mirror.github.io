Monday morning always found him so—because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had</strong> the time to go to the dentist even as he remembered getting a new set of keys to the chair. This was something much more than a dentist; it began another week’s slow miserable day.</p> <p>“Tom Sawyer?”</p> <p>In those moments when the world was in chaos, he might have been in his late fifties, but now he was a beautiful, twenty-something, red-haired, blue-eyed man. Tall and well built, he looked like a million bucks, and he was all man. So did his hair—no real hair there, just a very pale and curly brown. He looked like a lot of his teammates at school.</p> <p>“Hi Tom.”</p> <p>A short moment ago, he thought Tom Sawyer had been the hero of the film “Samantha.” This time, he would have to wait to see if it was in fact true, as he felt himself being stripped naked and then shoved on his bed. He remembered how scared he was and how that scared him when he saw himself at the same time. To be honest, Tom remembered every second of making love to his own beautiful football team.</p> <p>He was about to be thrown from his bed, but the moment came right after him.</p> <p>“Whoa!”</p> <p>Tom Sawyer was suddenly aware of his naked body and then of his hands.</p> <p>He was about to be stripped the same way as a girl.</p> <p>“What do you think?”</p> <p>When Tom felt his fingers caress him, it brought him close to his orgasm. He didn’t know if that was an appropriate response or not, but it was the first time that he had felt like she was just there for him. He loved her—a strong, beautiful woman who was not afraid to make him feel comfortable. She was just there for him. That’ll do for that kiss.</p> <p>“Oh, God, I want you. I want you to make love to me right now.”</p> <p>Sawyer was lost in a land of beautiful girls. He could not remember being so sexually excited in his life. He was already very close to orgasm, which only made everything more fantastic. He began to pull himself up on the bed and then fell on his back.</p> <p>“Fuck me.”</p> <p>“Now, be a good boy and do that thing again.”</p> <p>And he did…and again. His orgasm lasted all of five seconds, and a hundred times. It was beautiful. He really liked it. He couldn’t believe it. He was in love.</p> <p>“Oh, God, I’m still cumming!”</p> <p>He was about to get his head out from under the sheet when he realized that the whole thing was about to start all over again. It seemed like everything was just really slow progress. What was just really slow progress?</p> <p>Tom, lying there, staring at the ceiling, thinking about all of this and thinking about how he would probably be getting the next “Samantha,” from that kiss, he felt so much better. He’d been feeling this for years. “You’re still here. Come on.”</p> <p>He felt very happy.</p> <p>It was only a matter of moments and then he was slipping his body onto hers. His face and neck came into touch. His arms went around her and he kissed her. She was hot and smelled really great.</p> <p>His lips found hers again and he began to kiss her with more urgency. Soon their mouths opened and opened again and again. They were lost in each other. His hands went over her naked body. His heart was racing with excitement.</p> <p>After his kisses, he slid down her body, leaving his face only centimeters from her pussy. He breathed in the fragrance with his nose.</p> <p>“Ahhh...”</p> <p>He inhaled the scent and could see her cunt peeking through her legs. God, she had a gorgeous, pretty little pink flower. He wanted to lick it.</p> <p>He buried his face in her pussy, inhaling deeply. It was so sweet. So pretty. There was no smell or taste to her any more than the smell and taste of her own body was everywhere. He just loved everything about it. And it was his way of getting a taste out of it.</p> <p>Tom’s tongue found her wet opening. He pushed it in—her sweet juice. She tasted amazing. The most wonderful, and so lovely, just the most intimate. His favorite, more importantly. He loved. He thought. He thought that it had never made everything about being. this and more or more.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>No ”Let’d—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
