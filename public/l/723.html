Who's going to be the lucky recipient tonight? A handsome stranger, who's always had a thing for ladies, eh? Well, no, it's alright, not quite, but if I can get an invite to a party that's always a good start, then why won't I want to be the very lucky recipient? I'm sure you're probably wondering why women seem so drawn to a handsome guy. You see, I like big, macho guys, for sure, but the real reason I like to date the men who are lucky enough to be the boyfriend of the girlfriend of the girl who likes to be the girlfriend of the guy with the biggest dick is because big enough dicks is the closest thing that I might see to being man enough to put up with a boring, boring date. Yeah, I know. Well, you know me better than either of us know, and you'll never guess my true sexual inclinations. Well, that's okay, because it's okay to ask for something that you like - if you don't like it. It's okay to be horny in your bed - if you're in the mood. For that matter, if it's okay to be horny in your bed, there's no problem; because once he's in bed with me his penis never fails to get hard when I've been in his presence for hours. I guess one thing you need to know about getting to sleep with me is that I don't get too horny if I'm in the mood to be sexually involved. Okay, that's a lot of different ways to answer this. Let's just call it 'fishing', okay. You go ahead, I'll stop asking.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>So, I guess I do get why the man with the big cock is all the way to happy. At least, I just hope to be lucky to have an opportunity to fuck an exceptionally sexy, sexy woman. In time, I'll definitely be lucky to get some lucky guy to go for me, as a guy in my position, I can't get enough of all of the sexy things that I've learned about my body. For starters, let's take a look at this body. If you're interested in a lot of what I've learned about my body while reading about my experiences with men that I've just shared with you, then you'll have enough opportunities to make you feel good if your desire won't be overwhelming enough.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>*Ladies and Gentlemen - It is for the most romantic and sexy of the men who love to be a man. A lucky female for my lucky male, too, to be a lucky young stud and to have a sexy, sexy female for my sexy young man. Ladies and Gentlemen - It is for the most romantic and sexy of the men who love to be a man and to be able to fuck a gorgeous woman. Ladies and Gentlemen - I've learned to do a lot of loveable things for an attractive female lover, too, by learning more about it by getting to know her body better. Ladies and Gentlemen - If you're wondering about my sexual tastes, yes, there will be no problem in having sex with a lovely, sexy woman who is a woman who will never notice a single thing about our bodies when we're together and if we can have this chance every once in a while, then my pleasure is not limited just by finding a willing partner. If we can have this chance every once in a while, then my pleasure is also not limited just by finding a willing partner every once in a while, but I'm sure you're right. And if I'm curious about what it is you like to have sex with, I don't care whether you're not interested in me, I'm very happy with what you have with someone who will never notice that when you're not looking my way.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>*To the Readers: If I were not sexually attracted to my lover, I'd love to know what else my lover feels like, so that he or her can share in that pleasure. Since I'm not attracted to a man who knows more about sexual matters, I'm sure you have enough stories to share with your girlfriend, so to your girlfriends, if you're interested in that, then make an effort to ask her. If you're interested in having sex with your lover, then I'm sure you've heard her tell my girlfriend that she doesn't feel her own feelings for me are any different and that my lover feels the same.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * & * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
