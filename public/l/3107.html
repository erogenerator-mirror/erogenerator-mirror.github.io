Though there had been no chance to see</strong> anything of interest before, at that point we all felt that the sun would provide enough warmth for us to fuck, and for some reason we needed to be certain that it was still a safe time to see it.</p> <p>However the next morning it wasn't a safe time, not for us. There was no way that we would be able to do it. On the first day we were very sure that we couldn't, so we decided to wait until the next day. We waited, hoping that we just wouldn't get caught. After two days we were almost at the moment of cumming in one of the beds and we just couldn't wait.</p> <p>By the second day we knew that we would have to wait for a second time. The sun was up and we would have to wait until it became a proper day, but the moment our cum came on, we were all ready, we started the process. We were in love.</p> <p>First I took her in the middle of the bed, and I didn't stop to kiss her. I wanted to fuck her so badly that I didn't know how to tell her that she would be happy, but there was no problem. She was horny and I was ready to fuck her. We were almost too far away to even hear her cry out when our cum touched the bed. It didn't matter, we were together, and it was only a feeling of passion rather than something else.</p> <p>After an evening of fucking, of talking and getting to know each other, we were both ready to lie around the house naked all the time. At dinner we decided to be naked, but as was the first night, when we were in the bath we got out of bed and went in the kitchen naked and went outside to the house. We were so ready to show us that we didn't know what we were doing, but we didn't want to make it seem that we didn't want to do it anyway.</p> <p>She immediately felt shy and she came out with a questioning look. She asked me about what we were doing, but we didn't do anything else, we just stood, and I was already trying to remember how to talk. We could only talk to each other. When I saw her standing still again, I tried to speak, but she wasn't coming off my lips. That way I had something else to say.</p> <p>She knew that I didn't want to take the moment, but her questions were really getting to me and I told her that we had to be careful. I tried, but I couldn't make enough words to say to her. It was just so difficult to do on one foot.</p> <p>She looked at me and looked at the ground, and I told both of us that I didn't want to take the time for anything other than talking. She didn't hesitate, and she had a big smile on her face which said that it had been a long time since I had been able to say that.</p> <p>When it was time for us to go home, we knew that it wouldn't look too bad, so we decided to wait outside. The house was empty and we could just forget that it had been a while. It just felt comfortable to be naked around each other, and the idea just added to the excitement.</p> <p>We waited in the park, waiting for our parents to come home. We didn't have any idea what to expect and we didn't know. We just had to go around, but our heart was aching in time with each other. Finally we got home and we hugged and then slowly started walking across the street, still keeping that feeling.</p> <p>It seemed that we couldn't do it either, so we sat on the bench in the dark, and it was easier for me to talk than if I was on my own. I was starting to feel more comfortable talking with her. I guess that if I could, I could have gone a lot more talking on my own, but somehow we knew that we really could talk.</p> <p>While walking towards the window, we both realized that we did not know where our parents were, but we really didn't have any idea when they might come home. We both took longer to get to the window, although we still had our arms around each other.</p> <p>We didn't care for it, we just didn't care. We just wanted to make everything feel nice, and we didn't have to go too fast in order to be ready. We just could have walked right there on the steps of the house. Even when we were close, our bodies could reach a bit higher until we could touch each other. We would feel like we had an extra little part to our bodies, like two little buttons.</p> <p>We were still walking slowly and we were talking for the same time, but more and more and more and more, until all of his parents were showing themselves. Finally, we could do, my parents came back home.
