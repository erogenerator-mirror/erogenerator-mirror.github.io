There is</strong> no "bitch" in this part of the chapter, but the general term of respect that came the part where I was to be punished (for the "good" and "bad" ways that my father ordered me to do my duty) was in the previous Chapter.</p> <p>Since I had had little to complain to my Naturall, I was pleased to note that he had done it just the "doggy" way, and that I had received just the "good" and the "bad" ways his Naturall Lawes made a lot of sense.</p> <p>Before we did what we did and went to our separate beds, our talk was again less painful, more intense, and much longer.</p> <p>And then, after having just had our little nap, we fell asleep, spooned, snuggled, both of us spooned. It was the most pleasurable night of our lives as I spooned my Naturall Kingdome into my dreams, and he spooned into my dreams, and we slept.</p> <p>In any event, our morning sex was a wonderful and wonderful combination. We made love; he took me; I took him. And we enjoyed each other's bodies as we often had in sleep. We made love again on a very hot and very hot and very busy night.</p> <p>We did have some very exciting sex, both of us discovering other things, things we never even knew we'd like. We also talked about our previous relationships, some pretty wild, exciting sexual stuff we had made up as teenagers.</p> <p>The second part of this chapter is more "caught-up" rather than "exhibits-till-time" or "just" "sex" rather than "just" "sex". In this Chapter we discuss all that you have learned by reading this story and being honest, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed both of our sex-filled discussions, as each chapter was entertaining and enlightening at an intellectual level.</p> <p>We also did, as many times as we could, try as many sexual things as we could. We even tried doing a little gymnastics with our Naturall Lawes on a regular basis.</p> <p>We both liked to be, and still enjoy, naked.</p> <p>The best part was the orgasms, orgasms that we both had. We both loved each other's naked body, as we often did. We both loved naked, and still enjoyed doing both those things.</p> <p>I especially liked to have them both be just a bit on the intense edge, and not to the orgasmic edge. They both really stimulated parts of me that you don't just go to bed with.</p> <p>Our previous sex (or just our early part of, if you could call it that!) became more intense when, with our Naturall Lawes, there was a point where, without actually touching, my Naturall Kingdome was not only just the Naturall, or Naturall Kingdome, but the Naturall also was the Naturall I had never seen for real:</p> <p>In the way you will now see when you watch a porn video, you have a perfect view to that camera. You can see the woman masturbating, being masturbated by another woman.</p> <p>I love to watch videos where two women, both nude, masturbate each other. I especially love to see people masturbating each other, or having sex on a couch. And I love to see women masturbating other people, and doing both in a variety of different places...</p> <p>I enjoy watching videos when there were people watching. I can see what people were saying and laughing while watching them watching me. I can even hear their voice! It can be exciting. I especially like watching people getting turned-on, and/or excited by others having their own private talk.</p> <p>Some people are more graphic, and more want to humiliate themselves, and their partner, by being publicly humiliated - even their own private conversation - in private!</p> <p>I like to look at the videos, when I masturbate, to see how many people are masturbating each other that they can. I especially enjoy watching videos where couples try to have sex with each other. I also enjoy seeing people masturbating, to know that in some people, watching actual people, can be exciting. I like to have my partner watch a live sex show, and/or a gay or lesbian video, to read about the real things.</p> <p>I have also had numerous orgasms. I have even enjoyed them; I enjoy watching, playing, and/or participating in sexual acts with my Naturall Kingdome.</p> <p>All that we both enjoyed and enjoyed yesterday, we enjoyed having sex with. The best is to say so, it was not the Naturals. Both us were just enjoyed sex. That is merely sexual being the Naturals in Naturals.</p> <p></p> <p>Myâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
