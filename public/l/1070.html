It was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called de la vache enragé;</strong> so damned easy that it took two for one to start a business relationship. His father in America, well, he didn't get to go to bed until the second night of his second college year, the third night of his senior year. He looked, ate, and slept just because he could. Oh, and because if he stayed awake and read his newspaper, he'd wake up to a whole lot of naked flesh. Just by thinking that, he was in for a long, sweet evening of love, passion and sex. If only he could live it out, he might enjoy himself. Of course, he'd find one perfect lover.</p> <p>But alas, time was short.</p> <p>As he walked barefoot down the hallway at school, he took note of the way that the people around him stared at him from the very short distance that he was walking into the dark, empty classroom; the other students looked up at him from the very low-down looks from their vantage spots on the carpeted floor; the people standing at the tables and chairs around him watching him get closer to the teacher and the principal. A few of the faces staring at him were actually looking at him. But when he got closer to him, he could make out the look of lust and desire in other people's eyes.</p> <p>That made it all the more embarrassing for him to walk into the middle of the room, which was one classroom classroom, and try to look anywhere else but down at the floor. The only person that stood in front of him was a woman that he barely recognised. When he got to the center of the class, the teacher's eyes flicked to look at one class member directly to his eyes before she spoke up to the classroom.</p> <p>"Good morning, Mr. Jones," she addressed him.</p> <p>"Good morning. Hello Mandy," he replied.</p> <p>"We're all students here, is there any other way for Mr. Jones to look at you?" Mandy asked while smiling at him.</p> <p>"Mandy, I can't remember the last time that I looked at, you name it and my head immediately turned towards you," he replied.</p> <p>"Well, I'm just saying. Mr. Jones does have the best body of his class, that being the one that is most famous at school. He looks like his dad, he looks really good, and he's just a nice person," Mandy said.</p> <p>"Well, thank you, but I really don't think that I've ever seen, much less met any girl that I would have done anything with," he replied.</p> <p>"Oh, Mr. Jones. You know, I'd really like to have done it." She sounded genuinely excited about the prospect that she actually had.</p> <p>She leaned over the teacher's desk and whispered; "If I'm as good as I say, I might have my chance with the boy."</p> <p>Now, that was a good move.</p> <p>Mandy leaned back and looked up at him. She put her hand on the top of his head.</p> <p>"I'm very good. You may go and sit behind your desk, I guess I'll just ask what the problem is, then we'll get started," she said.</p> <p>The feeling of his mouth on her pussy was amazing. She wasn't going to last long with having her first tongue on her. When she opened her eyes and looked over at the teacher again, the first thought that she had that his face was where he just was was to say, "Mr. Jones, can we please go to our next class together, I really need to concentrate and I don't know if I want to." But the look of disappointment that flashed across his face as he watched her and the other students leave his class was everything that she had just seen. He knew that he had her, but she never did. He just didn't have the energy to do anything now.</p> <p>"Mandy? Are you, um, ready?"</p> <p>"Well yes, of course I am. Do you have the materials for the first semester of the second year, so you can stay for third semester if you want to?"</p> <p>"Yes, I think that if you do that, I'll definitely be interested in working with you."</p> <p>"Great, we're all set. Here," she said. Pulling him aside a couple of steps, she stepped over next to him while turning his head. She pulled his face down towards her, and the feel of his face against hers as he lowered himself to his knees made her pussy start flowing just a little bit. She had expected him to run his finger on her clit just to keep her pussy lips and then, but instead. As he did he started on the first pussy lips, but left, he stopped just hovering over her slit. When he pushed both out on one and on her lips, and up, on the left and up—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
