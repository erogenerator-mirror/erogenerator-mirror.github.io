THE FLOWER OF UTAH.</h4><p><strong>THIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of the Mississippi to</strong> Utah to Utah, they went to an all too familiar North American tourist attraction. They had spent their lives here, back in the 1960s and '70s, where sex was all but forgotten for them, and the sex had been almost as good in those days. So many things had happened in those days – from the hippie commune, the hippie camp – to the hippie church – how they had gotten here, to the Mormon church, to the Mormon Church, to the Mormon Church, and to the Mormon Church, but most importantly, the Mormon Church of America, the Mormon Church of the Latter Day Saints, was at the top of the pyramid.</p> <p>And that was where they had stopped. For one thing, the Mormon Church had officially stopped treating sex as an object at the temples for women, and all other sex-related items were reserved for the males. But for the Mormon Church to stop taking those kinds of stuff away from the female of the species, who had the right to be sexually excited, was a whole other level of humiliation for a Mormon.</p> <p>For another thing, for two hundred years all the females of America in America had been sexually deprived. A lot of the women of today hadn't been sexually satisfied and the males didn't either. But as soon as the Mormon Church closed the gates of the Mormon Cathedral, it took a different kind of humiliation. The Mormon Church closed the gates of the Mormon Church of America, the Mormon Church of Nevada (the Mormon Church of Utah), and the LDS Church closed the gates of the LDS Church.</p> <p>So you can see the Mormon Church would've closed the gate of the Mormon Church, and the Mormon Church would've shut the gate of the Mormons Church and shut the gate of the United States of America (US). A lot of the Mormon Church didn't do it any other way.</p> <p>The Mormon Church closed the gates of the Mormon Church of America, the Mormon Church of Mexico (the Mormon Church of Peru) and the Mormon Church closed the gates of the Mormon Church of the United States (US). The Mormons Church shut the gates of the Mormon Church's American embassy, the Mormon Church's embassy, the Mormon Church's security, and the LDS Church of Utah shut the gates of the American embassy and the Mormon Church's security. The Mormon Church would have closed the gates of the LDS Church's American Embassy just because there seemed to be so many places to run around naked.</p> <p>But, hey, people like to be humiliated at what they do. The Mormon Church closed those doors of the Mormon Church's Embassy and its embassy just because there weren't enough beds in the LDS Church's hotel to cover their nakedness!</p> <p>After they had all gotten there, the Mormon Church closed those gates of the Mormon temple and shut the gates of the U.S. Of America (US). The Mormon Church closed those gates of the Mormon Church of the America, the Mormon Church of the United States (US) just because there was too much of their bare skin showing, too many of theirs to cover.</p> <p>The Mormon Church of America closes the gates of the Mormon Church of the United States of America (US) just because there was too much of their bare skin showing, too many of their bare skin showing, too many of their bare skin showing and too much of bare skin showing…</p> <p>They all had their clothes on and went out, but the Mormon Church closed the gates of the Mormon Church of America (US) just because there seemed to be too much of their naked skin showing, too much of their bare skin showing, too much of their bare skin coming out!</p> <p>That was what the Mormon Church did all the time. They closed the gates of Mormon Church of America (US) shut the gates of the Mormon Church, shut the gates of the church of the United States of America (US), shut the gates of the church of the United States of America (US), shut the gates of the Church of the United States (US), shut the gates of the Mormon Church of America (US), shut the gates of the Church of the United States of America (US) shut the gates of the Church of the United States of America (US), shut the gates of the Church of the United States (US), shut the gates of its American Embassy and its American embassy and its American Security services, shut the gates of its Utah City of the Mormon Church of the United States (US), shut the gates of the Mormon Temple for the Mormon Church of the United States (US), shut the gates of the Mormon Temple for the Mormons Church, shut the gates of the Church of the United States (US), shut the gates of the Church of the United States (US), shut the eyes of the church of the United nation of the United States of America of the United States of the United States of America of Americans of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the Americans of Americans of the States of the United States of the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
