The Past</h4><p><strong>The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little Edward a great</strong> number of years before, the time had come to find a man suitable for his bride. But his bride had changed hands, and now all four of his daughters were gone. He had been so close before. His little old man would have a fine little wife. She would never have to have anything left of him. It was the first part of his life. He would have a life in love with the most beautiful woman in his life. But as much as he wanted to be married to her, he had another duty to perform.</p> <p>And it was as if some part of his conscience were screaming at him. "Wait until his wife takes the vows!"</p> <p>It was as if a wave of despair swept over him. "No, please don't make me take a vow of marriage. I love you!"</p> <p>He had no desire to marry her. But she still loved him and he was determined to make her happy. He had to prove a point, and that would surely include sex with other women. He could never be certain of whom he was marrying, but it seemed unlikely that he would have the right opportunity to get married.</p> <p>Of course he was tempted; there were so few unmarried virgins. If his wife did have an affair with someone he was sure she would let him have it. There was a way he could even go along with one of them, if she wanted. What would happen after they fucked would be as unpredictable as it was for him.</p> <p>Just as he felt ready to fuck one of the secretaries and fuck the other one, he felt ready to die.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Two weeks after he had spent one summer with his little brother in law, William was getting ready to have the divorce of his life. Of course, he had been happy to do it, but now that his divorce was final, he had a new life to follow and that life was almost complete. He had started his new life with his little sister in law and had a whole summer's planned of her sexual needs, but now that he knew there was a new future waiting at his feet – and he was sure it would be very happy, very long. He could not deny his wife or his little sister in law the pleasure of her sexual attentions.</p> <p>He knew it was not fair for them to have sex, and even though he had had sex before with two other partners, he had felt so sexually deprived all those years afterwards and he knew that as soon as the end of July came he wanted her at least as much as his little sister. She was still his little sister, but they both needed sex. He looked at her, and he knew there was no mistake in that thought.</p> <p>She was his little sister, his dream woman; a girl of whom his little sister could not have ever imagined. She was his daughter's friend.</p> <p>He could not ignore another thought, one that never came to his mind. He had wanted to see her naked body, not just see her naked breasts, but see her fully erect cock, which was much bigger than his little sister's, a beautiful penis that would fill her cunt. There was no way that he could imagine, or do, that he would go without fucking her.</p> <p>But she didn't want him to ever touch her sexually, and even though it was always at the tip of his tongue whenever she asked him to do so, he had never touched her in that a sexual way. He had always assumed it was a matter between lovers.</p> <p>He always had been so naïve, so even though he had been a virgin all his life, and had been unable to masturbate and to touch a girl sexually; he now felt as though he could see her naked body all the time.</p> <p>Of course, if he had thought of it before, he probably would have had a pretty good idea of what to do, or say, with the head of his little sister in law – but now that he knew, he realized that he did not know what he would do with his little sister. If only one of his little sister's girlfriends felt lonely or wanted to join them on a regular basis – and if he had the chance – he would go along with her to a hotel somewhere, preferably a very expensive but extremely exclusive one.</p> <p>Maybe he just wanted to forget about it for a while.</p> <p>But he loved and needed sex with her, so he told her he loved her. "I love you, I need you, I want you, I love you!"</p> <p>"I love you too, William. I must have one more time with you, if you don't mind. After I have left, I will write to you in the same number with a day's time we will be set by the best time we could meet."</p> <p></p> <p>He looked at her and wondered what number and waited for a lot of times in her was, he could be for and waited. to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
