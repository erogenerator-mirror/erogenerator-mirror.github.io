For Glaucon, who is</strong> the author of all the things he teaches, this was a first for him, as the most important act of the time.</p> <p>I slowly slid off his cock. As a lover I have done this often enough, especially to satisfy an aching need to be with something else. I wanted to show him just how much I wanted him inside me. With a smile I turned toward the bed and sat down.</p> <p>As a lover, I also knew that I was going to have to start with taking control. But I was really eager to fuck so I gently laid back and opened my legs.</p> <p>I heard footsteps moving in the room; he moved toward me, but I had nothing to hold onto anymore. I was going to make him mine, for life, forever. I needed him, my sex. He was going to take my pleasure. As hard as I might have tried to fuck him I needed the satisfaction of a man who had a cock to match the beauty and beauty of my body.</p> <p>I had no doubt that the next time I saw this beautiful penis in my hands would be when I let the head of it into my mouth. He came quickly, but it was time to move on to the next step. I held him to my mouth as he continued to fill me with desire. He wanted to fuck me in the ass and I willingly complied. I love ass. As I let his cock slip from my mouth I asked him what he wanted from me, and I told him just to fuck my ass. He quickly responded and slipped into me smoothly. His balls slapping mine with each thrust. I love fucking in the ass.</p> <p>I spread myself open to him, and let him enter me with an easy rhythm until he was in as far as he could go. I was about to come when he pulled back and held himself deep inside me. Then he slowly stroked himself inside of me while I was holding on to him with my legs. I had never done this before either, and just loved having his cock in me.</p> <p>After several strokes like this he started to cum. I thought I would burst. I squeezed his cock very firmly. Just a bit before I came all over his cock, as I was still trying desperately not to think any more, he suddenly started pumping his load inside me. We held to each other very tightly, and our hearts both beat faster and faster as the strength of our feelings came back. He held the cock inside me as he came in my body with such force, so much so I felt like I was never going to leave. I loved having him inside me and feeling his cock in me. "Thank you," I told him, and then I kissed him as I felt him explode inside me. "You are awesome!" I told him, and we both collapsed together. After a short while we were both completely satisfied by mutual release.</p> <p>We lay exhausted on the bed; we were still together. And the next morning I awoke to find that he was now awake.</p> <p>The first thing I wanted to do was get him to let me sleep. Not too much, though we both knew it could never happen. In either our bedroom or on my bed we would be sleeping in the spoon position. Our bed would be almost perfect for our sex. We could kiss and caress each other, and I would also be able to watch.</p> <p>When I thought that I could fall asleep I felt his hand on my stomach. He squeezed my breasts and I let out a soft moan. Then I felt fingers on my belly. I looked down to see his fingers caressing the sides of my breasts before they went back up to my nipples. We continued to slowly and gently rub each other while still having our eyes closed.</p> <p>He then let one of my nipples go gently with his fingers and started kissing me. "We are to be together forever," he said. That made all the difference when he said it, because I loved him and that made it. As he kissed and caressed me I knew that I wanted him at least for a full lifetime. We continued to kiss while I let my hands rest on his face and chest.</p> <p>His hands slowly traveled down my body until they were touching my wet pussy when he reached up to touch my breasts. He didn't tease me by taking his hands from me when he asked. He started sucking on my nipples while he fingered me. I never had anything so erotic in my life. We were both so far removed from our past sexual romps, from whom we could never return. But I knew that I wanted to continue to have sex with him. It would be our first time together, and neither of us should rush.</p> <p></p> <p>As I said before, I thought he wanted to wait to be with him, "for both of us, and not to have our time, I wanted to fuck, I would be with him, I had no reason to love him toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
