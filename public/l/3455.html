The time for thinking and debating has passed since the first days of our Roman Empire into the modern age.</p> <p>This has been true since the last revolution, that there will ever be more to be done.</p> <p>The Roman Empire began innocently by giving many young male citizens sexual stimulation with whomever they wished. As such, many of the firstborn were given sexual stimulation from a variety of ways. Some were forced to service a member of the opposite sex, in order to relieve the lust, while others were sent to exotic and forbidden places. Most importantly, they were allowed to wear clothes, to keep themselves warm and dry, and to relieve the strain on their nipples as the warm air touched them. Some of these were in the same way as the early Romans, by wearing tiny thongs, and then a hood over their head with holes and small buttons. The men who wore the hood were treated as slaves to a stable hand, and those that wore masks were then stripped while they knelt. The hood was covered with cloths so that people would easily know they were naked beneath. Most of today's Roman citizens still wore their hoods because no one really knew who they were anymore.</p> <p>Many of the firstborn also wore only their hoods to the extent that they were expected to provide sexual pleasures for their men. However, in case it might be necessary, some citizens hid their cloaks on the outside and made their men kneel and offer themselves to the world, only to have the hood raised to cover their faces. The hood, however, did not give one single cover.</p> <p>The firstborn did this for the first time, with a female servant maid dressed as one. Her long hair covered all of her face, but she sported a pair of large breasts and had an arched back, her shoulders and arms well over six feet tall.</p> <p>The firstborn had already mastered the art of pleasuring women, and the sight of the hood as a mask, his tongue caressing her inner thighs as they had never been touched, his hand caressing her breast through the material. The woman's body began to writhe as he slowly removed his loins while he pleasured her with his mouth and tongue. She could only sigh as she experienced an orgasm of her own in the throes of his pleasure. He removed his loins, so that she could feel his hardness as his member stood up in front of her. She reached out her hands and felt him as her hands began to stroke his hardness. She felt him as she stroked up the length of him. He moaned as she stroked him, and the sounds of his groaning became more frantic, as his desire continued to mount. His penis pulsed with his pleasure as much as hers. Her moans were music to her ears. She felt another orgasm approaching, and she could not take it anymore. She let her fingers glide down to the base of his penis and then back up, feeling the heat of his hardness and the throbbing of his skin. She let her fingers glide down the length of him, stopping briefly at his swollen head, causing him to let out a moan that she could hear as far as Rome and France.</p> <p>She removed her own cloths and began rubbing up the length of him, squeezing him gently, then rubbing him against her. She found herself rubbing her own nipples as she squeezed him, and his moan became louder, a groan that she felt as he could not withstand his desire any longer and let out a gasp as she pushed her hips into his hands. She could feel his heat as his hands caressed her breasts, but not his hardness. His erection continued to build, and she knew that her own body would be ready to explode as he would.</p> <p>His need was urgent, and with a final push she squeezed her thighs together, and he could contain himself no more and let his juices flow onto her. She felt their first release of the night rushing over them, her whole body convulsing in pleasure as she felt herself become an inferno. She felt him, too. She wanted even more than just to feel him inside her, as she squeezed herself in turn to feel the heat he produced. Her orgasm continued to ripple through her as her orgasm took over her. She could feel each twitch and pulsing as he filled her with his semen.</p> <p>The fourth of the eight were not given sexual pleasure in any way, yet. They were just made to kneel around the common room, their men in their uniform to maintain the status of a man and his masculinity. They were to be used as prostitutes in the common room, serving the men until the next Emperor arrived—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
