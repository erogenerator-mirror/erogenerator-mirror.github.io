The ambitious supposeth another man’s act, praise and applause, to</h4><p><strong>be his own happiness; the voluptuous his own sense and feeling; but he that is wise, his own action.</strong></p> <p>It was a Saturday. He'd been having a hard day at work, so he decided to spend it with his fellow workers having a long weekend; so he had to do some shopping.</p> <p>He arrived home around ten o'clock and the girls had already finished the shower; so he walked upstairs naked with a towel wrapped around him.</p> <p>"Good luck with that," he said, "you look like an angel."</p> <p>Kat replied, "You're not an angel, John".</p> <p>She said, "I'll give you a special thanks."</p> <p>"Haha, do I have to, do you think, my girlfriend's still coming."</p> <p>"Maybe she did, if you're not a stripper."</p> <p>"You're right, I'll keep you in the dark."</p> <p>They said goodbye and kissed passionately again, not to the shower, but to the bedroom where they spent an hour in bed, which was in his bed, with his own covers gone and they cuddled each other's bodies:</p> <p>"Oh, you feel so good," she said, "and I love your cock. Oh, oh, I need to be your personal cumslut."</p> <p>"Don't," he replied, "just let it go inside me."</p> <p>They both laughed as he slowly moved his cock inside her vagina. It didn't take him long, but it was hard work when he was too tired to fuck her properly. When he realized that she was having a difficult time, he stopped.</p> <p>"Ok," she said, "put it back in me. That feels really good."</p> <p>"You're beautiful."</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>He moved his cock in and out of her vagina again so they could both get used to it. After several minutes, he stopped again and told her that he should fuck her pussy.</p> <p>"I'm too tired, I think I need to go to bed now."</p> <p>"That would be fine. I'll go and get changed myself," he replied.</p> <p>She went to her room, while he went to the bathroom and took a bath. When he came back, still naked, he saw that it was only six o'clock. So he decided to wait. There were no visitors to the party, so he left to get changed.</p> <p>When he re-entered the bedroom, Kat was on the bed, with his cock fully erect, ready to fuck her and her pussy was wet from having the most intense orgasm of her life; although it was not an orgasm of ecstasy.</p> <p>He kneeled in front of her and placed the tip of his cock inside her vagina, where she quickly got into position and started kissing his chest. He massaged his balls with his free hand and continued kissing his chest with his free hand.</p> <p>Kat moved her hips up and down on his cock, which was harder than before and he moaned while she was feeling so good, when she realized he had stopped kissing again, just holding himself inside her while she had her second orgasm.</p> <p>They finally stopped kissing and started kissing again and he said, "I thought, that I felt a lot of love with your girlfriend, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't wonderful; I mean, she has a gorgeous body and I love the curves of her perfect breasts."</p> <p>"Mmm," she replied, "I'm so glad you felt me first."</p> <p>He kissed her breasts again, but this time he kissed her nipples; "That was very nice dear. Now let me make love to you," he said, and he placed his hand on her pussy.</p> <p>"Ahhhh!" she exclaimed, "I've never done it before."</p> <p>"Me neither!" he replied, "You're the first to ever do me doggy style."</p> <p>She gasped, "Oouuu... that is very nice... and it feels right."</p> <p>"Yes it does," he said, "I like the feeling when we did it together."</p> <p>"Oh, no I don't like the feeling. I've never done this before, but I love it." She added with a laugh, "Maybe another time."</p> <p>"I wish you would," he remarked, as he kissed her mouth.</p> <p>She moaned and said, "I need to feel it a second time to make it memorable."</p> <p>"I'm your man!" he replied with a laugh.</p> <p>He then turned her on her stomach and raised her ass to his mouth and he licked her pussy, and her anal cavity. They had talked about anal sex once, but she didn't like it at all and was hesitant to experience it since it, but since most of the boys in her boyfriends of the world was considered to do it.</p> <p></p> <p>While he continued licking her pussy, he kept kissing her ass while she moaned and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
