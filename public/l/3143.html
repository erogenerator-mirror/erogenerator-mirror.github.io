M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER III. Marilla Cuthbert is Surprised</h4><p><strong>MARILLA came briskly forward as Matthew opened the door. But when her eyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the long braids of red</strong> and blue ribbons, he couldn't wait to get right inside. And, to be very honest, he was just dying to see the first thing that popped up: Her eyes.</p> <p>"Are those for me?"</p> <p>"Yep."</p> <p>"I hope you enjoy hanging out so long," he replied, hoping to change the subject.</p> <p>"You will," she said, "and I'll." The moment her name was called for, Sarah had her hand in the front button of his shirt. She'd unbuttoned it, and then lowered her eyes to his pants. She could've easily undressed him right there.</p> <p>And, while he was all-too-soon-to-be-presentable as they pulled around to her car, he wasn't all-too-delightful as they drove to the mall's new store.</p> <p>As soon as they got inside, she took off his tie. Her bra and underwear went first, leaving him feeling kind of ridiculous, but they were already halfway out. She then undid his tie, which ended up being on the floor. After she unzipped him, she undid his pants and underwear, and got them off.</p> <p>"Now," she said, pulling his pants down as much as she could, "I guess this is what your underwear looks like."</p> <p>"Oh yeah," he replied, "that's what it looks like--my underwear." And, with that, their underwear joined the other's.</p> <p>A part of him wanted to strip naked, especially on the first moment she finally had him naked that first time.</p> <p>"Just sit down with your butt right here for me," she told him. "Now," she said as she turned the chair toward him and sat down on another chair.</p> <p>As he watched her slide down her black skirt and slip out from beneath it, he saw in the mirror how far it would've gone, so far. It would have gone far. Only, it wouldn't have gone far.</p> <p>"Now what?" he asked.</p> <p>"And, before we start with this, I'd like to ask you something," she said as her pussy and ass came to him.</p> <p>"Anything," he replied, before he could ask another simple question.</p> <p>"Do you want me on my knees before you on all fours."</p> <p>"Yes. Anything," he replied, before he could finish the question.</p> <p>"If you want me to show you my pretty face and my naked pussy and my wet face, please turn around," she said, after she was on all fours.</p> <p>"Okay," he replied again. "I'll do that."</p> <p>"Then please, sit down in the aisle," she instructed.</p> <p>"Now?"</p> <p>"What else?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just kneel down in the aisle and show me that face," he replied.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Then please, kneel down."</p> <p>"Yes, of course," he replied as she sat down in the aisle.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Do it," he replied quickly on the word. "No more of that shyness. You know you want to be sexy for us. I think you want to be sexy for us too."</p> <p>"But you're not sexy for me."</p> <p>"Then do it," he answered as he pushed his pants down and underwear off, his cock springing out with all its energy in that direction. It looked like a giant, hard-dicked soldier at the edge of the aisle, ready to spring up and start shooting off a cannon.</p> <p>"Okay, then let me," she instructed. "Put both hands on the aisle with your fingertips, your hands."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Now, stick out your tongue, right there."</p> <p>"Hmmm."</p> <p>"And I want to see how much of your tongue you have," she said as she ran her tongue slowly over her upper lip.</p> <p>"Now," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah," she replied Sarah.</p> <p>"Oh," Sarah prompted.</p> <p>"Okay," Sarah said.</p> <p>"Okay," she asked a he, said.</p> <p>"Okay," said.</p> <p>"Yes, said.</p> <p>"I got ready.</p> <p></p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>" "Okay," said she said; she said, said.</p> <p></p> <p>, asked. "</p> <p>"Okay, said.</p> <p>he said ' " I'll:</p> <p>.</p> <p>said, : said.</p> <p>.</p> <p>," was.</p> <p>said, said</p> <p>.</p> <p>said: . did</p> <p>. said: said. . ," saidâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
