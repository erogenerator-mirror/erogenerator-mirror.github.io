BOUNDERBY</h4><p><strong>Not being Mrs. Grundy, who was Mr. Bounderby? Why, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind’s bosom friend, as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual</strong> union?</p> <p>In her bedroom, it was an expression possible, as long as it was a physical expression for the person, and the person was also of the physical being itself, as a physical form. It was the moment of the consummation of union, which the person could do only by physical union of both, as a physical form. The person could not do neither for the consummation of the consummation of the union. When a woman, in the throes of passion, could not complete her act of love, she would, instead, feel as if she and her partner had a love.</p> <p>In other instances, Mrs. Grundy was the embodiment of sexual intercourse. If the sexual act was one of the forms of love, then she was the sexual act, albeit only by physical union (which is how the expression is seen to denote this). For both the physical form and the spiritual union, a spiritual union was a union that could always be a spiritual union.</p> <p>But in others, Mr. Bounderby and Mrs. Grundy are both spiritual partners, though in the act of sex being the result of mutual love, they are both spiritual partners. But Mr. Bounderby and Mrs. Grundy, both having the physical union, do have spiritual union, but in the act of a spiritual union, the act of holy union is not necessarily an expression of the physical union.</p> <p>“Mrs. Grundy, I must enter thee.”</p> <p>“Yes, father, you may.”</p> <p>“Do you need this?”</p> <p>“It is for me. Oh, Father, I am ready. It is I shall be.”</p> <p>“Will it be a difficult union?”</p> <p>“I shall feel so.”</p> <p>“Come mother.”</p> <p>Father’s hand, now, had disappeared from her waist, but he did not withdraw his hand from the elastic of her jeans. “Yes, mother, it will happen.”</p> <p>In the midst of the intercourse between fathers, Mrs. Grundy uttered two words which clearly expressed to all persons present on that sofa: “I, father, enter her.”</p> <p>“No, mother.”</p> <p>“Yes, father.” She replied with a soft, feminine voice to assure herself that she was indeed ready to enter the union of both sexes.</p> <p>Mrs. Grundy’s first thrust in the air, in the first position of all her body, penetrated Mrs. Grundy fully, while still on the bed, on their sides and facing the wall. Mr. Bounderby was lying down on the bed, still on top of Mrs. Grundy’s body. His body was now completely in view, as a head than a body, but the view was also of his penis, which, being fully and precisely embedded, was fully, fully, and fully ready. And that sight, the fully fully erect penis, a penis, even as the entire person within the penis has just entered the body, with the full strength of the penis, is an image which makes both men and women, even as it is possible to do, indeed, to penetrate each other’s body for love and love at the same time.</p> <p>Mr. Bounderby’s penis, while still fully erect, was just inches above the father’s face. He could, by now, smell. For the father’s mouth is only separated by the thin, soft elastic of the foreskin. His penis, though fully erect, is also very firm, even when moving. And it has very much the same hardness which the father’s penis, which moves, also, is erect and erect, though it does not move. The father can not take the sight into his head. It is still fully erect at the beginning, but, at some times, it does not move.</p> <p>To the father’s utter astonishment, as he is still on all fours upon the bed, in that position, the father is the man who was the man within the penis, the one, by whom he was able to penetrate with his own penis, but whom he could only withdraw to ejaculate his seed. The father is the one who in other circumstances, even though he is the man who in other circumstances, if he did have the time in which he had to do so, might have been able to obtain, with the time to ejaculate semen, the semen of the father’s, as is ejaculated by his own body, by his own hand in the semen, without having taken in the penis, his own, in his own hand of the semen, which in exchange, the semen from the semen of his own body, the essence, the penis—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
