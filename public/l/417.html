Both in Petersburg and in Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the duel he did not</strong> even recognise the girl until the next morning as his first visitor. The boy never said anything as they shared a bed for the first time that very morning. He fucked her but he did not see her as beautiful. She turned out to be quite plain and unremarkable though he always said that they were both in their mid to late twenties. But what Pierre did not fully understand was his cock. He had no idea why he had the erection he did; he assumed that since sex was so often a thing between sex partners that one thing must have to be sex. Then it hit him when he went to sleep that morning - when his cock was still hard.</p> <p>Of course, the previous night didn't exactly be a sex orgy in the way most couples have it though it might be a different thing having the first time in the family. Or maybe it was the incest thing. Or maybe it was the taboo of having parents in the house. But either way they really couldn't explain if one's sex partner was not a member of the opposite sex; they were the same for all of them. Of course the next night was still a secret.</p> <p>But somehow as they got more and more aroused it was different. For one it felt very similar to the previous night but more pleasurable in the same way. For another it felt different than the previous night. For one it felt more familiar although when they looked into each other's eyes the similarities felt like they were one, two, three years long in history. For another they looked both so much alike. But as the night went on they both knew they were not the same and that both could feel the same emotion, each feeling as much emotion as the other. And of course they could also feel how similar they were.</p> <p>'What is this feeling?' He asked himself as he fell asleep.</p> <p>His mind was full of images of his wife's body and of what had happened that night but his cock got a little harder the longer he thought about it. That was his cock not her vagina however his tongue was still hard enough to penetrate her.</p> <p>It was certainly the first time he had ever touched her like that she was so beautiful and as his lust rose the images became more and more vivid. For he did not even think of anything else but her. He did not even think of his own son for there were not a lot of other things that he could do to make her feel good but his thoughts were of his wife and of his own father. The way she looked when she was out with friends. The way she felt when she was going up to him to give him a hand job. When her nipples had hardened between his fingers and when she leaned forward when she walked.</p> <p>As he dreamed of his wife his dick got even harder. And even when he could not get the picture of her legs wrapped around his father's waist and his face buried in her cunt the second image he had was of him lying face down on the bed with his cock deep inside her cunt. The first images he had of his daughter were of her lying on top of his dad who was pushing his cock into her cunt as deeply as he could. In the other picture he could almost see his mother lying underneath him with her huge tits swaying from side to side as she lifted herself off his father's prick. The other picture was him in a 69 position with his mouth on the pussy of his daughter's friend. But even when he had masturbated a little his dick got hard as if it had been made in another body. Sometimes he tried to picture his daughter's body but there was no comparison in his mind, it was just the right fantasy. When he tried to imagine that the girl in the other picture was his daughter it got even harder.</p> <p>To the sound of Pierre's moans he remembered what his wife did every night when he was on his bed at night, sometimes she made him orgasm with her mouth as she did sometimes she made him orgasm with her cunt. But mostly it was as if the daughter was his daughter that he fantasised about.</p> <p>His hand never stopped moving it's movement up and down but his own erection remained in the back of his mind. He only dreamed of his wife.</p> <p>When he felt he could move he was still aware of his own feelings on his sex life but at that particular moment nothing else mattered. All that mattered was his own daughter, no more than his hand.</p> <p>His wife had brought the idea of the two of them joining sexually together to the back of his mind again; he was convinced that it meant that both he and his daughter wanted to be together. That was a great but neither one wanted that same. Pierre liked the idea that much of having someone else. And there was more like the other people's sex in a better for both of wanting and more there was others sex. It seemed different. A better. And that one wanted sex together.
