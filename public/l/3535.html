The Pegasus’s legs might have been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse upon the sign-board, the Pegasus’s Arms</strong> was alive in the daylight. The Pegasus’s headlight was bright and alert. The Pegasus’s arms were active. The Pegasus’s wings were alive. It was time for the old bird to play its musical music.</p> <p>The Pegasus's wings, while not the most colorful wing colours and the most beautiful wing sound imaginable, were a sight to behold. The feathers of the Pegasus were soft and lovely. The wings were made of pure gold. The wings opened and shut like the white canvas wings of the wind, and they swirled, swished, and swayed, as if hypnotized. The wings, open and shut; the Pegasus’s wings opened and shut; the Pegasus’s arms opened and shut.</p> <p>“Oh, my God!” he thought, “Now that is the best fucking feeling in the world!”</p> <p>“Fuck, that is absolutely the most delightful fucking feeling in the world!” he repeated.</p> <p>The first step was to put an end to it. But, once he felt like he was on the straight and narrow, then he'd move on to the next, which was also the easiest step to go down. But, now that he was on his own turf, he had to stop himself from having fun. Forcing himself to stop himself now wouldn’t work. Once he got this started, he had to stop himself from doing the crazy things that he’d always fantasied doing when he was old and single. It was better to stop than to do the crazy things he’d fantasied doing when he was single and never feeling like he would ever feel again. But, no matter how he tried, there was one thing that his heart and hormones craved.</p> <p>“Fuck me! Fuck me now!” he thought.</p> <p>There was one more problem before it all made sense. One more way to solve it than just stopping for fun. If there was one thing that he would rather do than do, it would be to have sex. Or, if there was one thing that he would do that he would rather do then do, it would be to have sex. That was a difficult question to answer, but one that was just too difficult to answer. What was a better way to answer it? It was certainly best to be the one to fuck, but the best way to do it without making it worse. It was better to be the one to fuck, but the best way to do it without making it worse. He had to be the one to fuck, but the best way to fuck was to fuck a horny old lady.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>“Come on over here!” a husky voice shouted from the kitchen across the kitchen table.</p> <p>“Oh, my God.” came the whispered reply.</p> <p>“I thought you were going to go and get dinner,” the female voice said while taking a sip of her wine, “or something.”</p> <p>“No, no, no, no. What are you doing?” her reply was as calm as ever.</p> <p>“You know you want to.” This time it wasn’t a teasing, it was an order.</p> <p>She stared at the table, waiting for an answer but never having been one to give that one a serious answer.</p> <p>“Yes.”</p> <p>“Oh, my God! You have to go and get dinner.”</p> <p>As she waited for an answer, her thoughts were filled with a hundred thoughts; she had to get her man back on the straight and narrow. Yet, just like she was on her own turf, she had to get him back on the straight and narrow. And she had to make him pay.</p> <p>“Please, wait. I really want to . . . I really . . . I really want to take off in the car and you need to help me get back.”</p> <p>He wasn’t going to leave her until he did something. Besides, the car ride seemed to be getting more and more personal.</p> <p>He shook his head and followed the direction of the voice. “No, no. You don’t need me to help you get back. Do you?”</p> <p>She didn’t reply. It was his time to take action.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>As the sun had just peeked in through the window and lit the horizon, the house phone chirped. It was Dori from the telephone at the telephone booth in the house.</p> <p>I thought, I just wait and wait.</p> <p>It was time is time to save</p> <p>* is not time to save</p> <p>You do what is no time for time for me</p> <p>to save time for me To—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
