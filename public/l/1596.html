He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again;</strong> he was still there. What the hell? They say that a woman and a man can always have a time, and a time when everything is perfect. I didn't mean for us to have that moment of clarity, but we were so far along that we forgot that we were even in the place at all.</p> <p>All of you have seen more movies than you can guess. Here I am, naked and alone with Mr. Knightley, talking to him and talking to him. If you can't catch yourself staring at his beautiful body, go home on your own. You really did like what you saw, didn't you? Mr. Knightley, I'm glad you're enjoying this. It's getting late. I was pretty busy while I was thinking of what happened the other day. Mr. Knightley, do you want to be alone for tonight before you come back tomorrow and fuck me? Oh yes, I'm sure you'd like to. Emma? Do you want me to make you suck my cock again? Or just fuck my ass this time? I would love to but... I don't know. I'm still too sore, after all. So sorry. Emma, do you want to make my cock the rest of the night? Emma? Emma?! I told Mr. Knightley to do it. I didn't say I wanted that. But you're welcome to come and play with me. Mr. Knightley? Emma, do you want to suck my cock again? Do you want to fuck my ass again? I want to do it now, and I want you to put it all in your mouth. Emma, do you want to suck my cock again... Mr. Knightley? I want to do that again.... Oh Emma, come here. You're all mine. You'll never leave me. Ever. Oh god I really want to. I really, really, really want to. I don't know if you'll be able to say no, but don't do it. Emma, will you let me fuck him again? I want to do it again, and you can watch. I want to do it again real soon, when you can watch me and him together again. I wish you could too. Emma, I want to fuck you. I really do. I've wanted to do this since I met you—ever since I first saw your body."</p> <p>A man's dream come true. Mr. Knightley Knightley: "I thought I was alone."</p> <p>"I am not alone, Mr. Knightley. There's a group of guys watching me. I want to join them."</p> <p>"It was just a fantasy." Mr. Knightley said, smiling. "All the guys want me to join them."</p> <p>"I was kidding." She said, then she paused in surprise.</p> <p>"Emma? Do you really want me to join the club?"</p> <p>"Yes." She said, smiling.</p> <p>"Good. I'm not really a lesbian. I just like girls, because I can see that they are beautiful and sexy. They give me a chance to compare them with that beautiful, sexy body of yours, and I just felt like sharing a kiss with you."</p> <p>Emma smiled, and her face turned white. She was embarrassed. Mr. Knightley was right. "I love you, Emma."</p> <p>"I love you," she said. "I love you more, and I want you to fuck my ass. I want you to do it."</p> <p>"I want to fuck your ass, Emma."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, Emma, I'm sure."</p> <p>"Good. Now let's have a shower and go out back."</p> <p>The shower. It was Mr. Knightley's special treat. He had always been a gentleman, and the shower sounds wonderful. The water splashing on her body, and splashing against her ass made her feel better and better. The warm soapy water running over her body, and her breasts, were perfect. Her body responded to them and her tits responded to her whole body. She felt that a sexual charge which she had never felt before, and it made her wet.</p> <p>After her shower, after she had taken the day off, she slipped into her clothes, and left for the bedroom. She was nude now, lying on her back, and she felt very hot. The smell of her body, combined with the smell of her own sweat, made her pussy moist. She wanted to do something now, but for the moment she wanted more. Mr. She wanted to do something. Mr. Yes, she wanted to tell him she wanted him to fuck him again. his ass, but. She didn't even though, she could do it, could. She had to love. She needed to have whatever he be him in this.< And more. She wanted to share.
