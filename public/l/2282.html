My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low;</strong> the warm sun had its own life—that, and this morning; I was going to be out of sight forever. The rain had broken.</p> <p>We had decided to head to the mountains. It's not the mountains that make it easier to get away from the rain. We were getting tired of it too; too tired of being out of the rain.</p> <p>We were stalling, and we were still taking our chances, as we knew they should.</p> <p>Finally, I spotted a trail. It was a little steep, and the cold, damp wood was a good choice for a spot. The path was smooth, and it led to the edge of the meadow. A few feet away we entered a small hut.</p> <p>When we entered the hut, I found my heart pounding with excitement; I felt a little like Superman, but only for a brief moment. Then, it was over.</p> <p>This place was beautiful—as beautiful as the forest, and so peaceful. There were some plants, but they did no more than gather into one place. I was lost. So was the village. We were there—about six hundred yards from the nearest hut, not more than 50 yards from the nearest tree.</p> <p>A little boy ran toward the hut, then darted through the bush on his way toward us. He stopped at the tree and peeked around it. He was obviously nervous. I walked toward him. I kissed him. He was in no condition to follow me.</p> <p>I whispered to him to come with me. I wanted him to take me to the hut. I wanted him to stay hidden from sight. We walked toward it. I went down to the ground and took off his shoes. I pulled down his shorts. I knelt down and pulled down his briefs. I kissed the end of his cock and licked it—no taste, no texture, just a salty, warm cock.</p> <p>I pulled off his panties. I looked at him and he stared in disbelief at what I was doing. He tried to say something, but no intelligible words passed his lips. But only soft murmurs escaped his lips.</p> <p>I licked it up one last time on the sensitive underside. Then I kissed the underside of it and slowly licked it again, moving down the shaft to the base . . .</p> <p>I licked the base of his cock a few times before running my tongue over the head . . .</p> <p>I got it about half way into my mouth when he started to push.</p> <p>I pulled off, and ran my lips down his shaft, across his balls, then up his full length and all the way to the crown. I licked all the way down the shaft to his balls. His cock jumped in my mouth as I tongued and sucked on them. My fingers encircled his cock. It was in control now; I had made the decision of what to do next.</p> <p>I took his cock in one hand and stroked him with the other as I licked and sucked at his balls. I licked them.</p> <p>His cock was getting hot in my hand as I cupped his balls and gently stroked his cock. His cock felt like iron. I wanted him to know that it was me that he could do anything with, in bed that he cared too much about.</p> <p>I took his cock all the way into my mouth. I sucked on him—no slurping or anything—not sucking, just licking him as the warm flesh moved in and out of my mouth. His cock made the first three, four movements of my head—not all the way, or the cock was. I just enjoyed him getting his cock sucked from my mouth. His hands were on my head, pulling it onto his cock—pullging and pushing at my hair.</p> <p>My tongue swirled over his cock. His hips were up off the ground; his cock was in me. I felt his hands on my head, he was pushing me down, as I was sucking and licking his cock. His cock was sliding and rubbing the back of my throat with each stroke.</p> <p>I wanted him, now, as he was; as he was about to come—and then there was so much he was getting inside my mouth. It was a wonderful feeling. I savored each drop, savored his cock sliding into my throat as his balls slapped against the roof of my mouth.</p> <p>I knew he could last. He would come sooner than I would. I wouldn't have minded if he did so in my mouth and mouth and somewhere else; in my body. But he pulled away as fast as he could. I could. He would be back to my body.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh, I was that was that?</p> <p>How was I wanted me, my self I, my body, my, I wanted me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
