OF THE NATURALL CONDITION OF MANKIND,</h4><p><strong>Nature hath made men so equall, in the faculties of body, and mind; as that though there bee found one man sometimes manifestly stronger in body, or of quicker mind</strong>, than man.</p> <p>Time had no place for pleasure in human sexuality. No woman had ever wanted a man's cock in her pussy before. When a man came in a woman it was by sheer necessity; when a man ejaculated into a woman his spunk may go unrolled into a receptacle that would not be opened before they left the ship.</p> <p>Nature's finest work was the sexual organ itself. All men wanted her pussy inside them. When a man took her pussy inside, which was the same old as fucking a man, men had every right, they thought, to have it wrapped about their cocks. Of course it didn't matter. If she wasn't such that a man was going to be able to take all of her, a man would have to take all of her; he would be as weak as a woman would be.</p> <p>If a man wanted to make sweet and loving love to her pussy, he would need to do everything she told him to do. If he wanted her to be passionate, he needed to satisfy her sexually so that she was sexually in need of his attentions.</p> <p>Nature had always been a sex goddess; as I am sure that she knew now. She always knew what the man needed to get his cock inside her, if nothing else. But now I guess it's time she took over. I guess it's time she learned to bring her man out of his shell, if only to satisfy him.</p> <p>Nature had never been a sex goddess, and I knew then that all mankind might come between her legs, if only she'd take over things. The man she'd been feeling up would have to give his self to her. If not by himself then by her. If he didn't want her to take over now he wouldn't be able to take care of himself.</p> <p>Nature knew it. She knew it. She'd been the one man who needed her pussy to take possession of him. She'd seen it through the window at the airport on the way back from her trip. She'd seen what her man needed to take care of that he had, from her as only her, and now she knew what manly essence was inside her.</p> <p>"Come over to the bed again, then, Mr. Williams, and lie down beside me."</p> <p>She always told me how she wanted me to lie with her when she made love to me, I guess I must say; after all I am a man. There is no other word for it, except sex, which is all mine now.</p> <p>She moved on the bed with me, laying herself with her legs spread apart and her arms and legs outstretched on the bed as I could lie there, beside her. She turned over on her side and put her arm around me as I lay beside her. She put a kiss on the corner of my mouth as she nestled in beside me.</p> <p>"I love you," she said. "I have never been a woman with anything in my pants; until tonight."</p> <p>There's no turning back, I thought, since she has already taken over my mind and my body is hers to ravish. I moved along side her as she lay with her head on my shoulder. She was snuggling in to my arms.</p> <p>I took her in every corner of my mind. I gave my entire soul before. I gave myself to her. I gave myself to her; I gave myself to all of nature, just as she gave herself to me.</p> <p>I was aware of her hand moving down my chest slowly. I tried to be still as she began to move her hand along my chest to my stomach.</p> <p>"Your cock needs," she said.</p> <p>It's time you had taken over some of the sexual energy of man. You're going to have to have some of it.</p> <p>I moved my hand up to hers and pulled it down to my cock, which stiffened under her touch.</p> <p>"It's time," she said.</p> <p>As I felt her hand move downward toward my cock, I closed my eyes and took in the sensation of her touch on my shaft as her hands moved down to my stomach to my stomach down to my cock.</p> <p>My cock had been lying there for a few moments, but now it seemed to be going to make an already busy day of it's business. It was now aching for her. I tried to not moan out loud, as I felt her delicate fingers start to pull up my shaft to my head.</p> <p>I watched as she held my prick down between my legs, and then slid my skin up it until she was touching my cock at my base. My cock was now pointing toward her, and straight up, as she had my hand was on my stomach, her hand. I felt her touch, but not. Her hand on my shaft.</p> <p></p> <p>"Touching me"But the thing, where." touchingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
