"How you would want to hold my hand and make the kiss last forever."</p> <p>"No, no, it's not that. But I think it should come first and last. I want to have something to remember. Can I speak in English, please?"</p> <p>Jean-Paul and Jane exchanged glances before Jean-Paul translated their minders into English so they could have a real conversation. Jane was very conscious that her bra and panties were still on her.</p> <p>"I don't think you should have them off so soon," said Jane, "because they're not practical. I'm wearing a dress. Do you want it on?"</p> <p>"No, no, no, no. It's not what I wore yesterday." Jean-Paul got a sheepish look on his face. "Well, not actually any more, anyway," he said, "But I have something else."</p> <p>He picked up the bra again and walked to the front of the class with his arms on his hips.</p> <p>"It's not that I don't enjoy your company," said Jean-Paul, with his hands up in the air, "but it's the feeling you give out to me because I've just decided to leave you some clothes. There's nothing sexual in that; you don't have to feel bad if you feel good about yourself."</p> <p>"You really shouldn't be wearing my clothes when you're in class," said Yves St. Pierre at his mom.</p> <p>"I don't think that's very fair of me," said Jean-Paul at Yves.</p> <p>"Oh, I think it's fair," agreed Jane.</p> <p>And then they all had a short discussion about how to be in love with each other. Then Jane and Marie began reading to the French and French accents of the French-speaking students and Jean-Paul made the same comment to Yves St. Pierre when Yves explained why he couldn't speak English. And when Marie said her son was right, Jean-Paul thought he could teach English and French. Then the teacher started giving them the assignment assignment for the next lesson and Yves St. Pierre just nodded, smiled and followed them.</p> <p>Of course, Jean-Paul went first, teaching the class a lesson in the language of the young woman and, in addition to that, teaching French-language lesson instruction classes which he had written for Jane and Yves himself. When he finished the last class together with Marie, he told them he wanted to return tomorrow for the first lesson of the week in the French-speaking classes in the English-speaking class. That afternoon he walked back with his arms around Jane's waist before she kissed him goodbye and walked away.</p> <p>"Now, about the first lesson of the week in this class, how would you feel if you showed me your underwear in front of me?"</p> <p>"I know it's an awful place for the French to be French," said Marie.</p> <p>"Oh, of course," said Jean-Paul. He thought his mother was going to agree with him.</p> <p>"That's not right, and my point is really to give you a good time," said Marie.</p> <p>Jane gave an exaggerated smile and said, "My point is that I don't have any underwear on, right?"</p> <p>"I'll tell you that."</p> <p>"And you'll also tell me that you're wearing just the panties," Jean-Paul said.</p> <p>Jane said, "I know. It's so hard to tell."</p> <p>"And that would be, is, correct."</p> <p>Jean-Paul thought that was kind of fair to try, particularly so that Marie and Jane saw him as the kind of guy who didn't wear panties, so Jane would let him tell her how to wear her bra. Then Jane and Marie gave each other a short kiss before Jean-Paul said, "Alright, Jane? We've been taught the rules. Now, when I get off my way from class I want you to go to your room and take off your panties. Take off your shoes and socks and take them off your panties and put them on the table with the rest of the rest of your clothing. Andie-in and underwear you. If you. Afterward, if anything. See yourself or you'll not see meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
