La Mazzolata</h4><p><strong>Gentlemen,” said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, “I pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to disturb you by presenting</strong> the Lord of the Rings, the King of Morrovrah? Well, I shall make my entrance,”, announced the Count of Monte Cristo with a smile.</p> <p>“The Lord of the Rings is a strange name; and besides, what I really meant was that’s not a very pretty ring,” declared the Count of Monte Cristo while holding out his hand.</p> <p>“Well, well, who would it be, Count,” joked the Count of Monte Cristo as he removed his hand, “I had my hand in your pocket, not yours,” joked the Count of Monte Cristo, “But I bet you could see one of our Rings around,” said the Count of Monte Cristo.</p> <p>“I would say that’s about right,” he replied, with a sly smile, turning around and taking the ring off, “although I wouldn’t believe that either,” he said as he tossed aside the ring.</p> <p>“You won’t believe that ring,” said the Count of Monte Cristo as he dropped the ring on the bed and began massaging his temples.</p> <p>“Ah, don’t worry;” answered the Count of Monte Cristo, “I’ll be fine,” he exclaimed as he reached down and began massaging his cock, “but how does it feel, anyway?”</p> <p>“It feels strange,” answered the Count of Monte Cristo, “but nice,” he said as he stood up and walked towards the Count of Monte Cristo to begin undressing.</p> <p>“What does it feel like now, Count, you really have a penis,” asked the Count of Monte Cristo as he removed his robe, “or maybe,” he asked, “any way you want to put it,” he said as he stepped out of his robe.</p> <p>Monte Cristo reached down and slowly took the Count of Monte Cristo's member into his hand. His erection was much bigger than any men’s had before they had their way with them.</p> <p>The Count of Monte Cristo began to stroke the Count’s shaft and gradually felt it harden. He ran his tongue along the shaft as he began to lightly tongue and nibble Monte’s head.</p> <p>The Count of Monte Cristo knew he couldn’t last very long on this occasion, but he didn’t care, as long as he was on top, he could have his way with the Count of Monte Cristo.</p> <p>Slowly, he lowered his hips down to the bed, where the tip of his erection slipped just inside the Count of Monte Cristo’s body, causing him to gasp.</p> <p>The Count of Monte Cristo quickly entered the Count’s virgin bottom, causing him to gasp again.</p> <p>The Count of Monte Cristo began to pump into the Count’s tight bottom.</p> <p>Monte Cristo was a virgin, even with his finger inside the Count of Monte Cristo, although he was still a virgin. In any event, his best efforts and skill would improve his chances of success.</p> <p>Monte Cristo began to rock his hips on the Count’s erection, fucking the man as he pushed himself into Monte Cristo’s body.</p> <p>Monte Cristo felt Monte Cristo’s hands against the back of his head, as he continued to thrust his cock up the man’s bottom.</p> <p>Monte Cristo's head began to spin at the feelings his body was experiencing, each in turn, as his balls began to stir in their sacks.</p> <p>Monte Cristo knew that he would not last much longer on being penetrated, although he wasn’t willing to take the risk. The fact that he wouldn’t be able to give Monte Cristo what he desired only added to his excitement.</p> <p>Monte Cristo could have made love to Monte, but he was also going to enjoy himself a lot more that he planned. He was only a cock in the mouth, not a pussy.</p> <p>Although, he wouldn’t have cared if he had been able to bring Monte Cristo to such a state of arousal, he wasn’t about to do it for long. It was enough for the moment.</p> <p>As he slowly pumped his cock into the Count of Monte Cristo’s bottom, he could feel his testicles swelling, signaling the approaching orgasm.</p> <p>The Count of Monte Cristo began to pump the humping of Monte’s began again. the rhythmic pump the fucking the cock, the dick the pounding the pumping of the fucking of the fucking.</p> <p>the pumping the first in the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
