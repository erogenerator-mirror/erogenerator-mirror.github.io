PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS</h4><p><strong>1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has</strong> brought us to our current present and for future life?</p> <p>I've given you the inspiration to get a deeper education, a closer mind, an active mind and a more solid grasp on the subject. A life of reading can help you think and reflect. The same thing can apply to us; it's a life of the moment. Don't wait for it all to die down. It's all about life itself. It doesn't make it any different from what the characters on the film in your mind is feeling.</p> <p>This is not the sort of life where you really want to be part of. But if you would like to talk about it and get back more familiar with the subject and feel more comfortable with the experience, you might enjoy it.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Author's Notes: Warning: The characters are fictional and not necessarily you.</p> <p>The Will to Truth is a novel written for erotica. To follow its unfolding will be very erotic.</p> <p>The first chapter will contain sex and violence but the main sex acts are still quite ordinary but, after all, you will find a lot of it exciting. As the reader will soon be drawn towards the main character's personal life she will also be forced to confront a lot of the questions of her life in a new and terrifying way.</p> <p>For some people reading this might be a bore to say the least. As a reader, I feel it's important to remember that the reader cannot necessarily read everything that's written in a book. Just enjoy!</p> <p>This is my take on the subject. It's fiction. I think I should have mentioned that. However, some parts are set in reality. If you would like to follow the line of it, I strongly suggest that you do, as I've written so much in the past. Enjoy!</p> <p>*********</p> <p>The First Night</p> <p>Tina had spent the day watching the stars and imagining them on the big screen of her bedroom window. She had been with Mike and Mike's parents for the last five days. She felt so relaxed. She had not slept in nearly three hours the previous night. She had been asleep for only a few hours. Yet, she was awake, thinking clearly and fully as she sat across the table with Mike. After all, they had agreed to share a room until Christmas, so she shouldn't do much else. Mike was not very religious but the idea of sleeping with Tina was just so nice. And it was better than being alone.</p> <p>As the day wore on Tina's anxiety and worry returned. She thought of all the things that she had done with Mike that other people did not know. The past was her life, the past was her heart. This might not be the right time to share a room with Mike. For the time being, Tina had found a special way of sleeping with him and it was the best way to do so. It reminded her of how he had been with her; how comfortable and comfortable he felt with her in the big chair beside his bed every morning. He was wonderful. Tina had never been able to get him out of her head about anyone.</p> <p>Mike was more than just her lover. He had always been her guide, her friend and her confidant. He had always been the one who had shown her things, helped her understand herself, the way to happiness. The one who had always been there for her in every way. He had always been like her mother. Allowing him to be that friend and guide had always been the ultimate gift her mother had given her. Yes, Mike was definitely a wonderful man. She thought of him as a very sweet and caring son. A very caring son indeed.</p> <p>But now here Mike was. Tina thought of him as a nice and caring man. He was nice, caring. That's good but there was something else too. She had to try.</p> <p>Tina could not wait to tell Mike. If she could only use her own imagination to get it out of her head.</p> <p>"Mike's got quite a cock," she said out loud to herself without looking at him.</p> <p>"That does take a little getting used to," he said.</p> <p>"Well, the first thing I notice is the fact it's got an eight inch cock," she said aloud, "a beautiful, big, gorgeous and thick one.</p> <p>Tina took a big breath.</p> <p>"You didn't know about it did you?" she asked his question.</p> <p>Mike looked surprised and looked even more surprised that she would even mention it. He shook his head.</p> <p>"No...not really," he said. "The thought of not having one is a little bit of a turn on. You think that perhaps. Even more that you've not had you the one," he said, giving in a bit of a hint of a hint of a hint of a hint that hint."</p> <p>Tina laughed, Tinaâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
