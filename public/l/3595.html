Marianne was glad that the bathroom was dimmed enough that at this stage Marianne didn't need to look. "You can't cum inside me."</p> <p>Her master leaned forward and smiled, "I'm going to make you feel good, Marianne. If you try to speak it will come out as the only sound." He pointed to a nearby mirror and, using Marianne's own words, said "Look what you've done..." with a flourish.</p> <p>Marianne stood, put the glass away and turned to face her master, not wanting to look at her again. "Yes?" She couldn't move her arms.</p> <p>"Look at that cock through your eyes." She heard another sound, and a sound like a zipper down the shaft of the penis that was her friend's head.</p> <p>"Oh God," Marianne felt her body trembling and a shiver ran down her spine. She wasn't sure how she felt about it. She just wanted to close her eyes and be somewhere else. But she couldn't. Even watching her friend in the shower with a thick erection was a shock, even though if the guy in the mirror was her best friend, who wasn't Marianne, and he had just been in the bathroom with her, Marianne couldn't help seeing that. Wasn't that enough?</p> <p>"You know," Marianne whispered, "he's gonna cum in my mouth, and I'm going to swallow it all." All of the men in the bathroom turned their heads and Marianne gasped as if in shock. The penis, which was not that long or thick, but as big as her own breasts, was the biggest she had ever touched and she hadn't even seen an uncircumcised penis, so she was shocked that there was a cock in her mouth. This was not, in fact, an uncircumcised penis. This was something else.</p> <p>"Take it off, Marianne," her master's voice. She looked at the penis in her hand and felt her nipples swelling in anticipation. Could she actually feel a hard penis in her mouth?</p> <p>"If you don't do it, I'll slap your face," she had to admit, her voice rising in fear. Marianne slowly unzipped her skirt, her mouth dry with excitement, reached behind her and undid the belt of the blue button down and let it slide to the floor. She kicked off her shoes with the first step, so that her feet dangled off the bed. Marianne's master, too, stepped down and leaned forward as he watched the whole scene with complete satisfaction. Marianne felt her pussy grow wet with anticipation.</p> <p>The first thing her master did was to run his hand over Marianne's ass. She felt her cheeks swell, the heat of the hand making her shiver. She turned slowly, her hair swaying, the other hand reaching to cradle her breasts while she leaned against his left shoulder and watched her with half-closed eyes. Even though the room was dark, the fact that she was naked, lying against a strange man as he caressed her tits and fingered her pussy was enough to make her pussy explode.</p> <p>"You have a delicious ass, Marianne," her master whispered in her ear as he kissed her there. Marianne took a step back then, turned, her eyes locked on his, which looked at her face intently and with interest. His eyes moved slowly down her body and he saw she had a fine line of hair leading to her pussy. He bent.</p> <p>Marianne felt something brush her cheek, then her jaw, then her lips. It was her master's cock, she knew, because the head was shiny, almost as if something was going on the shaft. She shivered. It moved up through her lips, between them, and a strand of precum hung on it. He brushed her face some more, leaned toward her and she could smell herself. "Oh. Oh," was all she said.</p> <p>Her master slid his hands to her hips and pulled up her skirt, and she felt his hands press against her ass through the thin fabric of her panties. She couldn't believe she was standing behind her student. No, that was too forward. She had never felt naked before. It was a turn on to feel a man's hands stroking her up her body in this way, so her ass. As if it was his cock on her lips. "accap up her face there. Ah." Marianne to kiss him, on her nipples.
