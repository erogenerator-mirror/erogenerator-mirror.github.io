As an afterthought, she wore her usual nightgown: a flannel shirt and slacks, and with no bra, with a long-sleeved white nightgown. The only other person she'd had a threesome with in the past was her husband, and she felt that she was an even more desirable one, though, nonetheless, they were going to be in one room and then, if necessary, if necessary, they could fuck on her marital bed. Of course, it was also unlikely that there will be another, and unlikely, chance that her friends would be in the same room; not even that she would even entertain the thought... and it didn't matter, really. She was going to have sex, she'd rather be out of the harm of it than to have a man screw her.</p> <p>"I think it's time that you got to bed. We're almost out of time, and it would be best if we had a couple hours to ourselves to talk about it. If it's not an immediate need, I'll do it." The man, she guessed, was in his late twenties, and it was difficult to tell if he was a student or an employee.</p> <p>And so it went for a couple weeks. After that, things moved steadily, steadily. When she went to bed, she did it with a smile, when she thought she'd be safe, with some trepidation. Sometimes, she could feel her pussy tingling, and her nipples stiffening. At the end of the first night, she went to bed with two thoughts: One, how she wanted to experience her fantasy for the first time, and two, how much she wanted to explore her fantasies. She did have one particular fantasy, though. In addition to having a threesome with the man she liked, and also having a threesome with her husband, she was getting a second threesome, with a threesome where her husband was being manhandled. She was thrilled that she'd imagined that.</p> <p>She knew that she was about to do exactly what she'd said--or rather, what she did, she fantasized: "Fuck, go on! Fuck fuck--" (The phrase "fucking, go on!" came to mind, as an early clue to why she wanted to fuck, especially when it came to being a dominant female. By this time, she had done a dozen "I'd like to be your slut") fantasies, and by the end of the third night, she was in awe of how much they made her want to dominate herself. At the end of her third week, she just about exploded. But she resisted.</p> <p>Two weeks later, she had come to realize that she was still on the edge. The third week, she had just about been ready to fall over, but she thought, "Oh yeah, I can't fall over, right? Besides, what is he like, what am I like to know?" she thought, as she went to bed with her thoughts. That night, she went to sleep with her desires, and her first thought was how much she wanted to be controlled. If it weren't for the fact that she'd already got into the habit of making the guy at the other end of the bed into a sexual fantasy, she would not have been able to resist. But now, a week later, she was ready for action, with the other's consent, and she found that she could do nothing to stop what had been happening to her, now that her fantasy life was taking shape with her.</p> <p>That afternoon, the man did indeed fall into the trap that she'd made for herself. They went to the next room on the top of the building, and were soon seated in the main room. He was her first man, and he saw her as the man in the window and was soon attracted, as she had done, by the way she looked. And as she looked at him, she saw that he was wearing an expensive-looking blue business tie, and that he was quite handsome. She could see his eyes, which were the color of her own skin, following the outline of his tie, which seemed to move in a hypnotic rhythm. He wore no shirt. His blue shirt collar was very thin, as it hung a little about his torso and covered his chest, almost to his navel, revealing that beneath his pants was the bulging cock, which she already knew was there, and which was probably about halfway erect, at least as hard as it had ever been. The tip of his cock was purple, almost as hard as the rest of him, which had swollen to a point about as large as the head of her husband's cock. Even as she watched his eyes roam over him, she saw the outline of his cock in his pants, and wondered, what it might look like with a woman's eyes. And as it was being made her in their union, sheâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
