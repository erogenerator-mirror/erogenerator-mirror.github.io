The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being</strong> in the water was almost comical. It had to have been about six inches deep. That's all there would be before the main event, which was going to happen when his sister was getting fucked for the first time by the Nellie.</p> <p>They had been drifting apart for a month. She was too busy to fuck, had been too busy to be with a family. She needed somewhere that could go now that sex was a big thing. Maybe the big man was going to join her, and she could still see him after the third day or a week or two in Australia, with that big cock buried into her pussy again. At least that is what the big man had wanted, he was going to get it.</p> <p>So how can it be like this, she thought, as her first orgasm came close and she thought she couldn't feel it in the ocean, as the waves crashed against her belly. She closed her eyes as the ecstasy hit her. She was feeling him, and he was hard. She felt him thrusting into her again, and started to shake again.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum," she gasped "it's so tight, feels so good!" And she wrapped her legs around his waist as she came. She knew she would keep his cock in her until her pussy was ready, and that they could both have lots during our lovemaking.</p> <p>It was too late. She just kept on cumming as she felt him pumping his second load into her. He was hard, and his cock was still at attention.</p> <p>He pulled out of her and rolled her away. Her eyes opened. She looked at him with those big brown eyes of his, and his cock. It was wet with cum.</p> <p>"We need to go," was all she said, and they walked to the water's edge where they could watch the sea recede into a blue line, as it disappeared under the lights on the horizon. She was the first one there. I could tell it was a good thing, as he was a lot taller than her, so they could sit on the seabank. They were kissing on the sea, just the ocean around. It took them some time to get to the sea, to get to the surface, and he had to hold her by her ass. I had a perfect view of her breasts. A view that would come in handy later, when they were in his bed. It was really something you have to think about as your second date.</p> <p>There was an endless parade of people down in front of them, from mid-thirties, to early twenties, with all the women dressed in the most erotic bikini or short top they could find. And all in the form of a man with a large penis. He was going to fuck his sister.</p> <p>"So I've come down here to see where we can get the same opportunity," he told her, as they walked back to the house.</p> <p>"But this is our first 'sport'. We are going to have a real live 'sex partner'. And we are going back to see the ocean before it gets cold, while we are in the water. The ocean is full, there is no way we are going to get a couple of hours of sun."</p> <p>"That's too many people," she protested.</p> <p>"I don't think that you want us to go back?" he teased.</p> <p>"Well, yeah, but we can't have that just as soon as we get back to our house."</p> <p>"But can we watch," he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, but first let's finish the fucking." His voice was thick and excited and commanding; his tone so sultry. She was a little apprehensive of that tone, as she was a novice, but once he got that down deep, she wasn't going to refuse.</p> <p>"You have to fuck me first," she said. "Then you can have me if you want."</p> <p>She took his hand and they walked slowly back to the house.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this," he asked when they reached the house, "It's been a while."</p> <p>That was probably not the case. It had been several weeks. They had no idea how many nights they had fucked over a decade until we walked in on them fucking. And when they were in his bed, they started to do things together until they had a nice romantic climax when they woke in the morning. They had to wait a few days before they could do it again, or start to plan. After they finished each other, they had to get out of the house, and he went back to his room. He was going to fuck her again, and she was his sister. No matter of fact enough that she thought, though that, even though, that she was that she didn't say it: "we just as a "we'll be the next month" when he had just a monthâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
