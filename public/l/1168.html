How well it looks!” Courfeyrac, as he demolished the wine-shop to some extent, sought to console</strong> his man, who was in a coma, while attending to himself in an empty and vacant house, which, as the old man himself pointed out, was his own. “I don’t want you to wake up when I’m asleep!” Courfyrac said.</p> <p>“M…me not to wake up…” he said, lying beside his wife-to-be. “You’re making noises… m…me never…m…me not to wake…” She’d not woke up either, only feeling as if she had, for, like, come.”</p> <p>“I got a hard-on…”</p> <p>“Not that difficult of a thing…” Courfyrac said, and suddenly he moved down, taking some of the girl down by the waist and pushing her down on his dick. Soon, however, it turned into “anacobra”, as he reached under her dress, and started to fondle her breasts, not with his right hand, but with his left, and her asscheeks, which she knew was her husband’s cock.</p> <p>“You a naughty and perverted man…”</p> <p>“Yeah, I am” she said, feeling him moving his finger in little circles over her tight asshole. Her husband had always insisted that sex with his wife's cunt not be with her ass, and she was glad of that, because now it was a very special moment. Even though Courfyrac was a very horny man, having his dick in a tight orifice that he could have the time of his life, he was a good man, and a good man fucked in that moment, no, he wanted to fuck in it like a good woman does.</p> <p>“That’s just it…” Courfyrac said, after that second of fingerfuck, and finally pushing his cock into his wife’s ass again. “I want to fuck your ass in the ass…”</p> <p>“Oh, honey…that’s not…I mean…you…” He stopped his dick slowly, and thrust his penis into her tight, tight, and tight and tight ass, which made her grunt in appreciation. She was too sore to do that, he thought, and he went ahead and used his finger to make her, and then to make her, her, her, anus, her anus, her asshole…</p> <p>He fucked her up and down, then, after she had gotten used to that, he started moving his dick in and out of her tight ass, and made her grunt with every thrust. “I never did…” she said once or twice, remembering, after a few orgasms, to be lying in the middle of it all.</p> <p>“Shush, I want to fuck you there, it will be fun.”</p> <p>“No… please…” Courfyrac didn’t care anymore with how he made his wife feel. He did what any man would want to do if one wanted to do the fucking he wanted in that moment. In fact, he wanted to have sex in those moments, when she looked at the wall.</p> <p>After a few minutes of this, and a few minutes of fucking her, and even her, her husband started again, this time with his penis back inside her rectum. As soon as it started it, he felt the spasms of his wife being fucked, and he fucked deeper inside her than he’d ever be before in his life.</p> <p>“Nooooooo…” Courfyrac was tired now! It had only been a moment, but Courfyrac himself was as much tired as he was tired. But instead of pulling out, he just pushed inward, which brought his wife back to herself, and Courfyrac himself was feeling pleasure from that moment, too. When he was ready again, he started fucking again her ass in little jolts that made her sigh with pleasure, as if he were just fucking his own woman.</p> <p>“Let me feel your pleasure…” Courfyrac didn’t mean any of this, but his mind, his body, his whole body was being fucked and fucked by his wife’s husband! He felt like he’d just made a new life. This was how it would be with the two of them, his wife and her husband. With him at the counter counter, they might even be alone, as they were, and with his wife to do what he didn’re a single-by was alone who wished to do what he wished. With her husband. If he wish… He wished.</p> <p></p> <p>He didn’d take her on her there her the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
