Our bodies and our love-making were more than satisfactory and we had certainly enjoyed ourselves. We lay on the chaise on her bed, we hugged and kissed and caressed and we had no worries that things might end.</p> <p>"You know we haven't fucked since we've been here and we have to make sure before we do this next time." she whispered.</p> <p>"Don't worry. I'll be waiting. When we have finished fucking it will be like it is before."</p> <p>The next day, it was again our day as she went through her period with very little ceremony between us, with us not saying a fucking word to each other or saying our names, and without any more words exchanged, although with some words exchanged.</p> <p>It was the following day. We had just walked through the village's gates to go through the gates of the castle and out the main corridor. Then we walked along the corridor to the rear door and through the front door of the castle's bedroom, and then we made our way to our own suite.</p> <p>We lay side-by-side on the bed embracing, gently kissing and caressing one another. I gently caressed her breasts; Lila gently squeezed and tweaked my nipples and Lila caressed my pussy and clit. At the time she was having an orgasm and I had her two or three more. We lay together for a while and then had our shower.</p> <p>We had no problems with kissing and caressing each other and had no difficulties in fucking; we both had terrific pleasure in taking the foreplay to a more exciting level. This time we slept with our arms around each other, but, at the peak of our lovemaking, we parted ourselves.</p> <p>We had a great Christmas experience. First our meal and second shower. We had sex very early in the morning and again and again at the bedside. We enjoyed sex with the morning after, then we continued in our home for the evening until early Saturday morning. During this time, Lila and I were in our room doing each other's most erotic fantasies and we fucked again and again, many times until late Sunday night. Finally we decided that we would return to Sofia to join Vikki's family.</p> <p>It was on that Saturday afternoon that Lila and I first met Vikki and that was a memorable evening and, by Sunday evening, we had been joined in the bed, fucking again and again.</p> <p>We had no intention of returning to Sofia to join the family but it was obvious that we'd gone a long time without sex. We decided that we'd try another approach to fucking and that we wouldn't get any more sex. The following Saturdays, we'd had sex a number of times, but we were still very much aching for sex. Lila and I had no interest in fucking Vikki or for her to join in on the next Saturday.</p> <p>There was nothing else to get at Vikki and I. In the morning, we fucked at least twice a day, three times a day, during the evening, and during lunchtime when we were having lunch with others. We had no problems with fucking after lunch. We also avoided fucking at night because we were too lazy to do that. That had been also to make our sex more memorable, as Vikki and I had much more sex after lunch than we did that day.</p> <p>There was nothing else for us to do for our time together in Sofia. We could always make love with Vikki or Lila. But we still didn't get to fuck Vikki and Lila before we'd fucked Vikki and Vikki.</p> <p>On the followingSaturday, Lila and I went to bed and spent the next hour with some mutual foreplay; fucking and caressing. We enjoyed the time together. We had sex each evening and during the week of our stay (Monday to Saturday). When we had sex, we'd do it again and again during the week. We still didn't get to fuck Vikki and Lila until the following Saturday evening. We'd have sex this weekend in London and Vikki and I would have sex on Friday and Saturday in Sofia.</p> <p>A fortnight after the holiday, it was we who were not at home. Vikki's parents had died in a car accident that she had been driving in the first month of Christmas break. The death had devastated Lila. She went to New York to live with Vikki. Lila's parents had moved their daughter and her sister to London to New York and had the East Coast city of Sofia, New Jersey. On the mother was now to Lila's parents, Vikki also New York had lived in London and had been taken her son-in to New York as she had been one of the city of—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
