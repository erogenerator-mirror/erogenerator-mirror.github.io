There he wavered between the two richest heiresses,</strong> "Andy," as a signal to buy them dinner. There he purchased all three, "Kolabat," and "Harlots." He then paid his bill and his car and drove to his house. She's on her way, he's already waiting in his new home, he just paid the bill. As he entered, they were waiting in the living room, so he quickly and silently picked them up and walked to his bedroom to wait in bed. He wanted to go to sleep without her, so after about two hours he was out of it. He went to bed in a daze, thinking of what she looked like, thinking of her with her breasts in his hand, thinking of him taking pictures of him fucking her. He did everything possible to delay his orgasm, but his mind was in his sleep.</p> <p>He slowly got out of bed and walked to the dresser, "Oh, I'm sorry," he said. But it was too late. She was in the room.</p> <p>"Hello?" she smiled while walking in his arms, her eyes moving to his face. She walked with purpose and desire, her body bouncing seductively in her tight clothes.</p> <p>"You are really happy to see me," he smiled at her. "And I'm glad you bought me a present," he smiled as he dropped to his knees. He pulled her top up and over her head, and then started kissing over her stomach and down into the soft valley between her firm breasts. He sucked her nipples into his mouth and felt them swell in his mouth. He sucked her breasts into his hands as he slid his tongue over her tight, firm body.</p> <p>He couldn't believe that there was someone coming to meet him here, but it felt like he had never been this happy. "And I love you," he said in his most sincere voice in the world.</p> <p></p> <p>As a gift to him, she wore a white summer dress with a white scarf in the front. It was sexy in a way.</p> <p>They sat on the edge of his bed and she told him some more about her life.</p> <p>They talked about some of America's rich people, but mostly what they were in the middle of. She was like a shy student, so it made sense not to mention her childhood in America. He told her about his mother's parents, she told him about her friends. All of that went good, so they discussed the situation all the time, but he felt compelled to avoid what seemed to be a real relationship if it included marriage. So after an hour or so he went to sleep, but never woke up so that he was still in the middle.</p> <p>Then she told him about her college years. She was so happy to see him.</p> <p>"Why don't you come to stay at my place with me?" she smiled. He agreed and they were both ecstatic. It was a nice idea if we could have an extra room and even though it wasn't like what friends were getting used to, this was fun. He kissed her cheek as if he had already fallen in love.</p> <p>The next day they met at the hotel in the evening and they ate at a sushi bar. They went to a movie while talking about the future, about what they would do. They danced a few dances, and then they had a couple more drinks. She was already feeling very drunk and he was feeling relaxed.</p> <p>"Andy, just remember I said I liked you," she said and kissed him.</p> <p>"Oh, I love you," he smiled and gave her hand a squeeze.</p> <p>With it being the middle of the evening, they went back to her apartment, where they kissed and made out for a while. He took her to her bedroom so she could take his clothes off and he had his pants and shoes off. Andy looked at him admiringly, and then to the bed to find him standing in the middle of the bed, taking off his shirt. Then she kissed his body from his neck down, down to a black strip of clothing that covered some area of his stomach, then he took off his pants and shoes and then took off the rest of his clothes, revealing his erect black cock to her.</p> <p>Andy began to undress him slowly, first. She had no idea what she was up to, but she was eager to watch him as he came down to his underwear. She got out a lot more than she usually did to help him, which meant they had sex every few minutes. She had no problem watching how he took off his underwear without waking him up. When she got naked she kissed all along the length of his shaft and on her way up to the head and she licked underneath, he got a few drops of pre-up. Then she said "I like "Oh my cock. I'm so I'm so you so to go to I'm go on."
