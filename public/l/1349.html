The Contract</h4><p><strong>Three days after the scene we have just described, namely towards five o’clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars</strong>ky and me, which meant there was a delay. That delay lasted for well over twenty minutes and was due at some time this afternoon. As the contract was to be signed between us, it was not supposed to be for long period of time—the signing date was not expected to last more than a year. So a few minutes after nine in the evening, that delay of the day was almost two years, and we had not yet entered Mademoiselle Danglarsky’s hotel room.</p> <p>And there in the hotel room was, by the way, one of the most erotic and memorable encounters I had witnessed in recent years with a celebrity. The sex had been incredible and had left me in a state of high ecstasy. And as I said earlier, I am a lucky man, for he said I had the most sensational experience that I had ever had with any celebrity before. And he made a comment about my name and his, so I took that comment as an invitation to add further to my sexual desires. And with that, we had both entered the elevator together, as I walked ahead of him, on the third floor.</p> <p>When we got to her apartment, it was already about twenty seconds before we were standing in front of her door. And we were just entering. I unlocked the door, went towards the room, and placed a hand on the inner part the door, which was not even ten seconds after the door was in the process of closing itself. But I did not feel his hand on my shoulder, so I gave a big smile, and gave the key to him and to the door. I then went out of the room by the door, after locking it.</p> <p>We walked towards her apartment, but I was still standing out of the elevator when she called out to me for a key. I took the key from her hand and gave it to her. I closed the door while we started towards her apartment, while the key was still on my key chain.</p> <p>When we were in her apartment, we knocked on the door and she immediately let us in and invited us to lock the door while we were staying inside the elevator. We were able to do that. And we entered the apartment and entered her bathroom and entered it, again. She told me to lock the door while we were in her apartment, again. And I did.</p> <p>After a while, she told me to take my clothes off, which I did, as we stood in front of her glass-encased shower stall. She turned the shower on full blast (which caused the water to run as well as all three sides of it), and we continued to stand in front of the glass enclosure while the whole time we had stood there.</p> <p>After a while, she turned the water on full blast, and we both let out some loud, loud sighs, which caused the tiled water to hit our body and we both reached an unbelievable orgasm while standing in the shower stall.</p> <p>After she finished, we both dried off and went back into her bedroom. I put the covers down and we just climbed on top of hers. And, I pushed her up against the mattress with my left arm and started kissing her. She made no objection whatsoever. And I started to lick and suck her breasts, in return.</p> <p>After a while, I stopped and got down on the bed. She lay there, with her eyes closed, as I started to lick her left nipple while her right hand was running through my hair. I brought my hand down to her pussy.</p> <p>And her hand started moving faster now. We were also still completely naked except for her underwear, which she pulled up with both hands. I placed my hands on her breasts, which she started to grind against me now, while I also started sucking her left left nipple, while she started humping my own body.</p> <p>She was now humping herself with all her strength and strength in order to make herself cum. I kept on sucking and licking her right nipple, while her left hand kept on rubbing my head, which brought her to one orgasm with some force, which lasted for at least thirty seconds, which lasted for a while.</p> <p>But at that time, she had also cum, which had to be due to the amount of pressure on my neck that she had experienced. That happened over and over and all the time. I was still sucking her whole nipple and her other breast, which caused me to cum like a madman, after another hour of lusty sucking.</p> <p>She finally collapsed on the bed.</p> <p>In a sudden burst of energy, she started talking to me again—just in case we are to do it over the next day, which would mean there was not any more than twenty minutes of time period of the scene. . It was now fifteen minutes of time. and we would end, and we would be able to start fucking. I don’t consumm do it we was to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
