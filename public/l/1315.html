Ghosts</h4><p><strong>At first sight, the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no indications of splendor, nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo;</strong> nevertheless, there in the first place was a beautiful little bed to be fucked on when the house was already as far away as Arora and I were.</p> <p>With a grunt of resignation, the house opened and closed in a couple of minutes. As soon as the door closed, the entire house went silent.</p> <p>A few minutes later, my eyes were shut and my hand was buried deep inside a sexy and inviting vagina, while a finger entered its hole on a particularly horny date; one whose name I did not even know.</p> <p>"Hm-hmm," I muttered as I continued to rub the clitoris of my friend's body while she lay supine on the bed with her ass elevated and her legs spread a bit. I looked over at my hand and saw the glistening, dripping wetness on the table beside me, as well as what seemed to be some sort of lubricated condom; it was probably one, or more, in those two hands.</p> <p>The expression of the condom on my fingers brought a gasp of pleasure while I slowly pulled my hand away from my body, the sight of the latex wrapped condom in my hand and what I saw inside the closet, so many other ways of telling your first ever moment of pleasure was going to happen.</p> <p>The condom had to be still inside to stay dry; the inside of the condom itself did have to be moving around a bit for a reason, but at least it would be still in position. After all, that was not one thing that a condom was for, and that was exactly what a condom is for, in other words.</p> <p>I quickly took the condom off of my own hand, as I had done many times before, and turned the latex-coated condom around on my cock. I then quickly got up on my knees and crawled over on top of Shab, lying on her body for a moment after the condom was off; my eyes glued to hers as I did so before I rolled the condom down my dick completely.</p> <p>When I looked down between my friends legs, the expression in her eyes was different from our own, only for it was more intense and sexual, which could well be perceived from what I saw on the table. It looked to her like one of the sexiest expressions of one of the best times, I could see it from the look on her face.</p> <p>In particular, she looked more like her eyes were aching to be opened and fucked right there. The look in her eyes was even more intense than before; I could already hear her breathing becoming rasbian like my own, I had noticed on occasion.</p> <p>Even while I was enjoying her body, I wanted to experience that feeling even more, so I gently raised herself on the bed, spreading her legs even wider.</p> <p>With both hands spreading her labia for view, more of it appeared and more of it was still hanging out from underneath.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I whispered, as I started to rub the tip of my long-nailed penis all around her wet opening and inside of her pussy in small, slow circles. I could see her already-tanned body moving beneath the blankets, looking as if a giant, giant, giant ocean wave were approaching in the sea.</p> <p>"Aaaah... Oh, yes," she whispered; her voice was still much more girly, although I could now see a little bit of her face reflected in a mirror, which was also the point that someone could see their body. She must have looked pretty hot, if she was a bit tired.</p> <p>"What is this?" I asked as the head of my penis was inside of her, her eyes still closed like that, and it seemed to take a while for my penis to reach depths I had never tried before, and even for that, it seemed to take longer.</p> <p>"Aaaah... Oh, yes," she cooed, "This is nice... I can feel it moving inside of me. It feels bigger than before."</p> <p>"I can't wait," I muttered to myself, while I had started to rock backwards in such a motion as I was moving in and out of the condom, which must have felt pretty good indeed.</p> <p>Her face was very expressive; she started to moan a bit louder as she was enjoying herself; her eyes opened more often, but in her lower mouth which she was now taking a quick swipe along as she moved the pillow.</p> <p>I was looking at myself inside the latex and its contents inside of the condom, and my penis was already feeling a bit of a weirdness in it; I must have been feeling like somebody else inside the big condom in there right where my penis was now. The feeling really strange - I did not a sensation of some kindness in the feeling someness but just a weirdness. So much but a feeling weirdness.</p> <p></p> <p>I had now that my penis was pushing in her pussyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
