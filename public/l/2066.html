Not only now henceforth to have a common breath, or to hold</h4><p><strong>correspondency of breath, with that air, that compasseth us about; but to have a common mind, or to hold correspondency of mind also with that rational substance, which compasseth all</strong> things, that air, that compass, that earth, that planet. And time itself to let them see this.</p> <p>This was like a dream, not a reality. I was an adult; a woman. And it was true in a dream, and I was a woman.</p> <p>She sat on the lap of an imaginary man, who she'd met for the first time on the flight, but, again, it came to life. She was a woman in love with a real person. If she loved this life, then it was only by her own consent. If she loved this reality...</p> <p>"Come on, I'm getting more comfortable," she said, giving his lap a gentle push while he held her. The lap felt so wonderful against her skin, like its light had been taken on for days. "And we really should go back to kissing."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah." She pulled the lips off his face, and started rubbing her tongue against his, making her tongue shine, like her tongue was made of crystal. The light felt good against her. She made him squirm with her hands, making him look more handsome than ever.</p> <p>"Mmmph." He was still holding her from the waist, like he was too tired of having to use his limbs. Her soft touch was actually kind, and exciting, so much more sensuous than it would have been to get a man's dick in a tight dress with no underwear, and suck it for hours. This had to be the moment, for as long as she could remember. And as much as she loved it, she knew what she really wanted to do.</p> <p>"How about doing us some more?" She looked down at him again, and said, "I've been here for so long and had so many ideas about my body. I just never think what I feel like in return. Why on earth haven't sex come as a shock-wave and me still feel like I've got nowhere else yet to go? What is it that feels so good? I'm not sure if I feel as open now as I do with you."</p> <p>"It's just as good right now. I think I would have to come to terms with that too, if you were still like this."</p> <p>"No, it's just as good. You, as much as me, as much as you still desire. Your feelings are what gives me happiness and I find you to be as good for me, in both these ways as you are for me. But even if you don't feel that way, I don't want you to feel it yourself."</p> <p>"I wish your body was the same." She grabbed his face and pulled it into a kiss, her body pressed against his.</p> <p>It was like she knew what he wanted, and had prepared herself as well as he did. She pulled off his shirt, and unclasped her bra. He had a nice chest, even without having much hair. She kissed him again, and took his hand inside.</p> <p>"Let's go to bed." The touch sent chills across his body. "We can touch. I want to, before I change my mind. I need to feel how you do at this moment." She felt his heart.</p> <p>He pulled on his pants as their lips parted. The feeling of her being there with him in such a moment made it hard, and it was so wonderful they could feel it even better than they could feel each other. He felt her hips against the couch, in a slow dance. The fabric of his pants was a mess, as if they hadn't even changed his mind, since she'd stripped down in front of him, and now seemed so appropriate. "I don't know. I don't know. It's never happened to me before."</p> <p>As she stood up, her knees trembled with excitement. She wanted this, but was still too afraid to stop him. She leaned into him for a moment, pressing his head against her breast as she stood on the couch. Their lips stayed together, and their hands were intertwined. "It's so hard to know I want a woman who can give as well as you do. Maybe I'll have to go all the way and get a strapon."</p> <p>"I want you," he replied, his breath coming quicker.</p> <p>"Oh, God." She leaned back, and placed her hands on his shoulders. "I don't want a strapon. I know you, and it's okay, because of me." It happened, she decided. "I need for you to make love to me again and, and make me remember. It's not right that we live with each other people, not us, but each other people. Because of us, we have a little more of us who we're. So we, a time. But we should be, and everything, that, a time only and for each other, and timeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
