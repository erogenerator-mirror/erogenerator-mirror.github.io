English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XXXIX. Poets.</h4><p><strong>People have sometimes said that Nietzsche had no sense of humour. I have no intention of defending him here against such foolish critics; I should only like to point out</strong> the one who wrote Nietzsche in the first book of his life and who was quite the poet who was published in the English New Zealand Language. In the way you are feeling, I must agree with them, too.</p> <p>A short while later, we met, sitting side by side on the back deck. It was a beautiful setting, bright skies and the breeze blowing past our faces, the gentle sound of a distant thunderclap, the sounds of raindrops and a gentle breeze over your feet. We sat close enough that the scent of the flowers and grass mixed with our skin and then as we embraced and kissed, the sound of thunder clanged in our ears but we didn't care, it was just our own breathing and our eyes closed.</p> <p>I am sure we breathed the other one in as well when a loud noise emanated, like one of those static bangs that occurs periodically in a hurricane. But it was so distant from us I doubted people would have heard it anywhere. We just kissed again and then I rolled over and faced up to him.</p> <p>"You were such an idiot," I said, almost a whisper.</p> <p>He chuckled. "Yeah. You know what I mean. Like maybe a small number of people were thinking."</p> <p>"Yes," I agreed. "That might be true."</p> <p>We kissed again and then a soft, familiar sound began.</p> <p>"Don't move?" he asked. "I'll just stand up and put my arm around you."</p> <p>His hand found the waistband of my shorts and then around my body. I felt him pulling the shorts down over my hips and then my panties, the sounds of his jeans sliding down and my panties. He felt my body and then turned me around toward the water, which at first was too cold for us to stay in the warm pool, but he took them off quickly and then dropped them on the towel nearby.</p> <p>I felt his hands on my back, a little bit rough but it soon turned to sensual touch as he pushed me into the water. We kissed again, our mouths opening and our tongues pressing over each other, and then I felt his hand on my chest. His finger found my nipple through the thin material of my bra and I sighed softly and shivered. I pushed myself toward his hand, which was now resting on my breast, which he pressed on and then pulled up, taking my boob in his hand and then taking it out of the bra, his finger flicking over the nipple and pulling it hard. Our arms were around each other, and there was no awkwardness as we both liked to show our bodies to each other, but we didn't do this with anything other than passionate kisses.</p> <p>He took one of my arms and wrapped it around my waist while I held the other with the one on his neck. He turned me around toward him and pushed me down on my back. Then he was taking a cock in his hand and guiding it into the wet opening between my legs. He kissed me again. "I'm not so sure about that," he said. "I think you got me hot, but I have to agree with you, it felt good."</p> <p>"Yes I did," I said and he smiled and then turned me around to face that cock. He slid one hand on my back and then on my leg and I felt him behind me. He lifted one knee and then the other exposing my naked body to him. He slid one hand up my leg and ran his fingers over my outer part. I felt wetness on his fingers and then felt a finger sliding down to my cleft.</p> <p>He was sliding his finger around inside me while his other hand gently rubbed the nub of my nipple. Then as I felt him slide a second finger in, I felt a finger touching some other wet part of myself. It was his finger inside me, which made me feel very sensitive for him and then he had another little finger inside my opening. He pushed that finger inside a bit and then pushed it in as far as it would go and pulled it completely out and then down again. I felt the wetness on my skin and then slid my legs apart to help accommodate it and he did as he was saying and continued to explore while I just closed my eyes and enjoyed what he was doing.</p> <p>At last he pushed his finger inside me. I had gone to the edge and then he withdrew it and then pushed inside me further until my body accepted it and then pushed it back in. Then he pulled his fingers out again and I felt him slide his wet finger against my exposed hole. Then he pressed against it, sliding his fingertip in and out like it was a cock and moved inside my body. I liked, but felt like my insides were being caressed while his hands played with his body, feeling so sensuous, touching, touching me. I enjoyed. It felt really sexy, stimulating.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>and it feltâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
