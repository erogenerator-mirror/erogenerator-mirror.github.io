Mr. Pontellier declined to interfere, to interpose either</strong> for his pleasure or for her. Edna's father had been particularly ill-tempered over the subject, he'd taken great pains to avoid any further discussion, although this discussion of being her new husband had made her quite angry.</p> <p>"D'yer, she'll never be my wife," I said aloud.</p> <p>"I'll never be your wife, and no!" Edna shrieked.</p> <p>"But you'll marry her," I said again.</p> <p>"No!" Edna shrieked in earnest. "No!"</p> <p>"Edna, no," I repeated. "No. It couldn't be..."</p> <p>"Please no!" Edna screeched. "No! He didn't mean it."</p> <p>"Edna, Edna," I said again. "It doesn't mean anything. If you want to marry me, go. Be happy that the only thing on this earth it matters to you is your own personal fuck. Don't try to stop me. I don't really care!"</p> <p>"I don't want to marry you," she insisted. "I've only been there a month. I can't even remember the last time we were together. Now, is the time I'll have to change my mind. And now you're giving me reason to get in your car to go home. I have to go back and change it, because there's no going back."</p> <p>"Edna, Edna, don't you get it?"</p> <p>"I'm not giving you anything. You can decide what we do, what we do, what we do. If you don't like it, tell me. That means that you want to do it, I can, because you're married!"</p> <p>"No! Edna, please don't do it! We can't. You can't! You're my sister. I'd never think it. We're not going back to the wedding."</p> <p>"Yes you'll tell me now," Edna said, putting her hands on my shoulders. "Don't you think we should talk about what you're doing next? You don't know what we're doing when we're alone and not making a big deal about what we're doing all along! And yes, we're doing things with each other."</p> <p>"It's the wedding, Edna!" I snapped. "It's the wedding! Now don't forget it or I'll sue you for incest!"</p> <p>"No, this is the wedding, this is the honeymoon, not you!" Edna snarled at me. "This is the marriage! You're marrying your own incestuous sister! Stop it! Just do it!"</p> <p>"Edna, we can't do this!" I snarled back.</p> <p>"Then I have to, Edna," her father said, sounding a little like my own dad. "I have to. I'm married for at least a year!"</p> <p>"No! Edna," Edna interrupted. "I can't. I'm married for eighteen months! We're not even fucking!"</p> <p>A chill went up my spine. Edna was married for eighteen months, she was also fucking my father. And she was not happy.</p> <p>Edna continued to say that I'm "unfaithful," which I didn't agree with. And I said that the "faithful" part sounded too right to me. I said that the "fucking" part was indeed right, and that, in fact, it felt more right. I said that I'd probably like it and would do it again. Edna was obviously mad, and then her dad started to say something else.</p> <p>"Edna, what are you saying?" Edna's father asked.</p> <p>"What?" Edna asked as she looked at me, wondering what I was trying to say.</p> <p>"You know, something about marriage!" I snapped. "All along we were married!"</p> <p>"But now you're marrying me," Edna countered. "If you don't want me to be your sister now you'll just tell me."</p> <p>"Edna, you've changed, too much! Your father's coming after me!"</p> <p>"Dad, he's coming after me!" Edna snapped, rising from her father's lap as if trying to stop him. "I'll tell him!"</p> <p>"Edna!" my father said.</p> <p>"Just tell him!" Edna snapped at me, and I had to raise my voice to get the last syllable out so that she wouldn't wake my father. Edna stood up and stormed out of the room, slamming the door shut behind her. There was no more time to talk or think about the decision, after all there'd been a couple of fucking.</p> <p>Edna, if you've got married me and the wedding, and she had married.</p> <p>if'd—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
