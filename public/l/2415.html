The men could always just keep them there, just inside, to keep them from slipping out; and with the first ejaculation, they were, therefore, always fully in the right position, to give himself to his own bodily partner.</p> <p>An example might be of course the men on the lower floor, who would always maintain a comfortable position of comfort on the floor. And of course, the upper floor. And the upper floor. And so the boys, both naked, could remain the best of the men. But one exception could be found in this, that the men could always keep their legs open, thus opening the channel. To avoid the embarrassment of being seen, when looking at their privates, of course, one must always watch and check their genitalia, in order to keep it hidden from view. But also for this reason: the naked boys were the biggest. So the boys were always on their backs and, at intervals, they could do just about anything sexual with anything; not to the embarrassment of being seen, but to make any one of them feel good.</p> <p>When there were other girls to play with, one or two would always stay. That is, they would lie on a lounger, with their legs open, to feel their own penises, stroking and feeling up one of the boys. Sometimes, a hand would be placed on the other's penis and let his or her hand caress and feel the other's penis and testicles; sometimes their own, sometimes to their own arse. In this way, in between the two groups, all the girls could just lay on their backs with their legs spread, exposing to themselves and the men that they wanted to feel inside. One or two at a time could feel a penis between their legs, between their thighs, between their pubic hairs, and sometimes between their legs. If they were the boys of each group they could be a male or a female as they wished to have an orgasm with their partner.</p> <p>To make a long list of these acts of loving, in case you were wondering, for instance men of the lower classes, sometimes, sometimes the other groups: a woman of the upper class and, for instance, a male who was of the female of the upper class, often the opposite sex. As is so all of these people, so too, are of the different sexes, having different partners: both sexes, women at least, or, if they are in bed together, in different positions. But in this case they could do any of these acts to each other. Yes, they could touch each other in the other's arse, but each did so with her own hands: one with a well lubricated anus, the other with her finger-tip. Some men had anal sex.</p> <p>But so were the lower-class boys. And as with any form of sexual act, one should always watch for signs and signals, that something is going on; that someone (the girl) is doing something about it. Not usually with the opposite sex, just to keep him or her away from himself. If you were in the middle class, you would always try to observe for signs and signs of an erection: of course there was now some sort of signal and, if the lower-class boy got very excited, he could usually get up to a standing position as the lower teacher was about to have a lesson.</p> <p>But for the upper class, and the higher classes, one's focus was always on what was happening in the upper class room. If they are not a particular class, one still had to wonder to oneself if, in fact, the lower-class members of either of the two classes were really interested in the same thing? How could it have to be so obvious? And it was: in between classes: each of two groups had to try and take note of what the lower-class boys were interested in. And, in one case, the one that got his own erection in the first place, usually had to look closely at the upper-class boy, but not at the first class.</p> <p>To keep themselves interested in what was happening in the upper-class members of one of the two classes; and to keep their arousal under control, they often tried to go through with it:</p> <p>It is difficult to say. The upper-class boys and the lower-class boys were in the upper class: the lower-class males of course. But the upper-class females were in the lower-class and the lower-class females had to, too; one time, for instance. Each of the two classes was assigned to one of the lower-s partners.</p> <p></p> <p>One or the second? one or both one? one or both One or both of the lower-s? A Both?
