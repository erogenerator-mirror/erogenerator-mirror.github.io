The Queen ordered him to sleep, and made him eat his own soup that was dripping from his chest to his knee. Then they fucked in the finest rooms of the palace, each of us alone with a few hundred other lovers until the next feast.</p> <p>I had never been fucked so hard, so often, and I had never been so thoroughly fucked by a dozen men. But I'd never been fucked so hard that I had passed out. And I'd never been so thoroughly fucked that I didn't have a headache.</p> <p>"Come along, my dear, you are the first one to cum in this room. And now I know better as well, for now, but not for long," the Queen smiled warmly at him.</p> <p>I looked around me, at the others in the room. I'm not one to count the number of cocks I've taken. I was a total whore in the Queen's bed. And I was always ready to take it in the ass, although I wanted more than once.</p> <p>"Please, fuck me on my throne," I beg.</p> <p>"I don't think so," the Queen replied coldly. "This was for your own good."</p> <p>"For mine?" I was in shock at her attitude and her contempt.</p> <p>"Yes! So be it," Queen Victoria said with a smirk. "That is my right."</p> <p>I had heard enough of this bitch over the next few days. It was just the way she talked. Her mind wasn't what it used to be. Yet, it still called to me. But she knew that was how it was and knew that this was just another way of dealing with her. I still thought that it was some way of dealing with me or her. And she had been a good hostess and I'd had her and I should have treated her as such too.</p> <p>But today she wasn't in a good mood. She looked tired and her eyes had gone glassy. "What is wrong with you? You just don't seem to know the difference of age?"</p> <p>I felt a little hurt. Queen Victoria was older than Queen Victoria and older than so many. There was no reason for me to feel this way. I looked at her and she looked back at me with the same sadness and hurt. I wasn't the one who was being fucked by the young Prince.</p> <p>So I just stood there and watched as the queen and the other male servants of the throne came up to me, to help me strip off my clothes and get into Queen Victoria's bed. The queen helped each one of them off and they were all naked.</p> <p>"Why are you here? Why are you here?" I was in a daze.</p> <p>"So you can have some time to think on how to handle your marriage to that man that you had only known two days earlier." Queen Victoria looked at the younger one at the foot of the bed and I saw her looking back at me with concern. I saw those eyes look at her, but she didn't look happy.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "But not as much as that bastard. The man has come to love me. To get me out of a hole of a hole you're in. What a disappointment that could be."</p> <p>"No, that's fine," I said. "Your husband here wouldn't want that, would he?"</p> <p>"He is your husband, but not to forget that, now would he?" she asked me.</p> <p>"It's what he has been doing since he got there," I said. "I'm sure of it. He has tried to convince me to divorce you, to give you up. It's the only way."</p> <p>"To just let you go, you mean," I said to her. "No divorce! No sex with you after, no children!"</p> <p>She looked up at me. "You should know better. What does it mean, you know?"</p> <p>"I know that you and I were married three days ago. I know that you love each other, and that you have fallen in love with each other at times like this."</p> <p>"No, no, your husband has tried to stop that. I know that I have loved you for years, but the feeling of loneliness I have of never coming out is the worst thing ever to happen."</p> <p>"That is no lie," I said. "I've been with this much of your time and I had done with yours. But only a short time ago you were so miserable that you would sleep with another man on occasion. Today."</p> <p>"Oh. Your husband is one of these days, not long ago, and I told me," she said her.
