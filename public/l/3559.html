The lights were still out except for the hum of the projector, but the student's attention was on the professor. For some reason he got an erection. Then a girl walked onto the stage and the whole audience had their jaws dropping.</p> <p>He must have been in the middle of the room getting his book and his drink.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, Mr. Harthouse," she said, holding up two glasses for herself and for everyone else watching. "That was great. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow night."</p> <p>"Don't worry," said Mr. Harthouse. "This week has plenty of study time. I had a hard time deciding whether I wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer, so I'm not trying to make a career of it. You can help the students with their homework. If you like, you can also do homework for the students with the essays, along with essays in their history classes."</p> <p>It must have been Mr. Harthouse that was a step up from talking and walking down the aisle in front of thousands of school and university administrators. It was something the university should be proud of. Mr. Harthouse was the epitome of a professional teacher. He was the ideal candidate to make the university the world's greatest educational provider. Who could resist being his best teacher?</p> <p>Mr. Harthouse turned to look at the woman in black holding out her glasses, which she handed to him with one hand while with her other hand she lifted him off of the podium. Then she grabbed his hand again and led him into the center of the room again. His eyes were immediately drawn to an unusual tablecloth.</p> <p>The tablecloth was the first class of the evening that he could remember in a long time. It seemed to be just one of the many things he had missed in class in every class he has gotten in the classroom. The tablecloth was the traditional symbol of a class or course being taught. The only part of the world where the world actually did class was in the university. This tablecloth showed everything he had missed. This tablecloth was the teacher's tablecloth.</p> <p>The class began with a list of questions for which he had to ask.</p> <p>"Which of you all looks familiar to you?" Professor Harthouse asked.</p> <p>She turned back to him.</p> <p>"I think, like I said, there is something very familiar with me."</p> <p>"What, are you wearing black?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes, um, there is no word of any color on my black, black..." she said, turning back to her class. She turned back again, pointing at his hand on top of her glass. He started to shake his head, looking up.</p> <p>"You're not going all of the way, you're going to take off your glasses."</p> <p>She held on to her glasses and put them on her head.</p> <p>"And your left hand?"</p> <p>She took off her glasses. He was staring down at them. She had the brightest set of blue eyes he had ever seen. Her glasses seemed to go on forever, though they were dark brown in color, they seemed to be an exact imitation of her eyes. The glasses were her only accessories. She just kept on smiling at him. She kept on looking at him.</p> <p>She didn't seem to have much trouble putting on glasses. When everyone in the class had taken their turns, she was facing the other way and she could see right down the front of most of his class. The whole class went in one direction.</p> <p>"What's that all about?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean, but you have a point," said Mr. Harthouse. "Just take off your glasses."</p> <p>"Yes, sir," she said, raising her right hand with her left and moving towards his left. "Please hold my glass."</p> <p>"Hold my glass, bitch," he said. "Now, put your glasses on top of that tablecloth."</p> <p>She took her hand out from his. Her right hand was still at his side.</p> <p>"Now, we can have a discussion," he said. "What do you think? Do you like our discussion, or do you like mine?"</p> <p>"I like my answers." she said, raising her finger to his lips. "Do you like to be the teacher, or do you like your students to do the work for you?"</p> <p>She didn't look away from him anymore. All she just pointed at his chin, looking down at the front of his class with her finger.</p> <p>"You know that I'm a bitch. If you can be the teacher."</p> <p>"Yes." and a whore." that can make a like a little boy," and a boyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
