I grinned as I realised that the sword had just fallen there on its own, and even though the sheets had taken a long time to clear, my sword was already lying on my chest when I awoke. I had been out for the night, and had fallen asleep with the same sword in my hand.</p> <p>I felt the sun through the curtain at the back of my head, and a little bit of light went in when I opened my eyes. They were wide and shining, as they had been when I was out on the deck, and I smiled when I saw the man lying on the bed next to me. The room was cold, but he lay there on his back, and his arm was over the bed, just inches away from me. I knew what he wanted. He wanted me, but he also wanted me to climb on.</p> <p>I wanted him badly. A little, I thought, and got out of bed. I could hardly walk; he was a prisoner of me, and I wanted this, he wanted to be on me, and I wanted to get rid of him, but I had no reason to care. I made a few preparations, and I could almost hear the noise of the corkboard door opening, and as I pulled the curtain aside I got a glimpse of him, I was hard and fast, my dick was almost throbbing, the head of it was swollen and it needed some sort of stimulation. I had taken advantage of him, and that just left me to my own desires. I took him to the bed, and I saw on my reflection. He was naked, and as I saw for myself the length and girth of him from head to crotch. I looked down at myself, and I saw that my dick was already hard again; I was not very large on my frame, but he was just right. I saw the large globs of my precum on his cock, and I moaned as I saw it. He got on top of me and I could feel his cock slowly, and steadily enter me, and I felt his weight as he went deeper, and deeper.</p> <p>There was no gentleness to the penetration; I was like a wild animal taking what it wanted - all of it. One thing I could feel was the hard head of my dick sliding past the spongy, pliable, tissue at the front of my body. He had to go and then I could feel him going up and down, he was the only one there. I moaned and whimpered as he drove himself into me, and he held me close as the sensations swelled in me, all at the centre of the whole body. He kept on going, though the thrusts grew longer, and thicker, and more powerful. I moaned and groaned as he went faster, as his dick was driving into me deeper and deeper, he fucked me, fucked me like he would fuck a demon. And each thrust was the head of my dick as it went deep inside of me, my fingers gripped and played with his body in all the right places as he fucked my ass with the sword, drove my penis deep inside of that tight little hole where you cannot get down to your manhood. There were little things like that.</p> <p>And he fucked me harder and harder, and I could feel like I was about to come. I was going to come, and I had to be careful. He had to hold me up as he sank into me, and I felt his penis go deep and hold on as he went on, and he went on and then I came, and I came some more, and he held and held on. His penis felt great as spurt after spurt of sperm pumped out into me, in some cases even more than I was used to, but I was still alive.</p> <p>He was in me. My whole body was alive - in more ways than one. I had to feel him, and I knew I had to, and that he would have to. I felt the warm stuff of his come inside of me as it spurted with the force of a river from the inside of the man. I felt his hands on my back as he lay atop me - like they were everywhere else - as he moved his cock in and out of my ass - as he held to me and moved up the length of me. The whole room was open so I knew I could feel all around me. And then I saw him - I saw him, he saw me, he saw you, and when he saw me he came, and came. He came on me. I saw him doing that, I saw him moving in and out between my legs, and seeing him, seeing him, he showed me his penis, and how he was there. He saw me, like it he was there so I was with me with me but he wanted.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I could feel</p> <p></p> <p>andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
