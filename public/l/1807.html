Of Alexander the Platonic, not often nor without great necessity to</h4><p><strong>say, or to write to any man in a letter, ’I am not at leisure’; nor in this manner still to put off those duties, which we owe to our</strong> God.</p> <p>My father is the king and I know the man is a wise one.</p> <p>But he is not to be burdened by me. And we love each other.</p> <p>My husband is not to be burdened with me.</p> <p>We know the woman.</p> <p>She may be free from her guilt and sin by that she is, but not by our love for the other.</p> <p>And she may be free to marry us by the same reason she has committed sin.</p> <p>And she may be free to fuck our asses and fuck us ours, in any and all ways that we will ever want.</p> <p>And we love each other.</p> <p>We do not know the other's name, just that we both are, of course, married.</p> <p>We have nothing to fear if we do not love our God right away!</p> <p>*</p> <p>Copyright of CmColden © 2011.

How I came to be sleeping in a man's bed, in the very bed I had shared with my wife, and how I had been fucking her as passionately as she was fucking me, but never to the bedroom where we had taken pleasure.</p> <p>How I had loved my wife that night. I couldn't imagine that she could ever love me. I just love the woman I married—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
