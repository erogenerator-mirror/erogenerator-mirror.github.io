Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER I The Halls of Heaven</h4><p><strong>To the learned man, ugly of form and face but sound at heart, Holly by name, a citizen of a northern land whom at times I think that once I</strong> was proud, a proud man with all his life's work and experience to honor, I'm here to remind him of today. His name is Jack Smith.</p> <p>A youngish and somewhat chubby man in his late forties with a pair of glasses, Holly always felt it her duty to wear them for his sake. I often had questions about the age of her glasses, and the fact that she also had smallish breasts. When asked, she always replied that she didn't. Holly always took that to mean that she had nothing to do with it, that nothing important mattered.</p> <p>As if reading my mind, Mr. Smith made me feel good, and his eyes sparkled as he said, "So you're pretty much just a nerd now!"</p> <p>"Not entirely," I say. "I can't really say it because I'm not really a guy, and I can't tell what it is, but I'm not exactly a boy either."</p> <p>Holly sat in her rocking chair and gazed at me over her glasses. Her dark long hair cascaded to her shoulders, her light blue eyes looking deep into mine. Her lips were parted slightly, and I wondered what kind of kiss she was going to give me if I weren't quite so young to be waiting. If she was giving me a big kiss, I was hoping to get lucky and she was going to do something or, at least, get into my pants.</p> <p>"So would you like to have sex with me?" I asked.</p> <p>She replied, "I'd like that very much."</p> <p>"What do you want to do with me?"</p> <p>"I don't really know," she said. "I probably can't tell what to do with you."</p> <p>"Good! You like it when I touch you."</p> <p>Holly smiled.</p> <p>I'd like to say that she was a nice little girl, but in truth, I didn't have much faith in her either. I didn't like touching. I don't know why. Maybe because I didn't particularly like it.</p> <p>We lay down, my legs and arms were around her, one of her boobs dangling in my face, my hands stroking her belly. Holly was just as lovely in the nude. Her tits, with their perky nipples and areola, were soft and small. Her waist was tiny, her hips slender and her legs soft and shapely. The most beautiful thing about her was that she was a virgin also.</p> <p>Holly is always very tight. I guess it helps to have small breasts as her lover and your only lover. Most of the men I've had, even the dumber ones, don't seem to have a great deal of experience with women. Sometimes I'd get them too sore because I would just throw them out, but that's how a lover.</p> <p>Holly had a lovely figure, a little fuller than most of the women I know and certainly not one of those that you get your hopes up too high and high. Her breasts are big. Her nipples were hard and pointed straight up from her chest when she was sitting. Her belly was trim, and her waist was small and flat.</p> <p>I've always thought they had all that they could handle, I thought. I don't really have a great sex life. I've never had many female lovers, if any, and while it's not anything like a lot of what I have at home, to tell you the truth, it's certainly not what I have in the bedroom. I'm not exactly popular yet, but I'm pretty good at it, and when I'm on my knees on the bed, I don't really have to do it all. The best I can do is sit up and try to get my knees under my chin each morning.</p> <p>I do try doing that but in the end, I couldn't. Not yet anyway, if anything. I guess the world of sex is in the toilet so the man has to settle for women on this world. And if things don't work out, so much the better.</p> <p>This afternoon, I told Holly I needed to go to work and get dressed so we could start having sex.</p> <p>"It's okay," she murmured. "After all, I'm at your house."</p> <p>Well, that's a relief. I might have to come back to campus this evening. If I do work out, I don't think I'll need to wear panties after all, no matter how soft they are.</p> <p>"Can I give you another kiss?" Holly asked with a sly smile. "I really would like that."</p> <p>Holly looked me square in the eye and I felt a little twinge there. But right there. I could certainly can be better. The best not to go to see. I must go home. The answer, "Let's you go, I could be, I say this isâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
