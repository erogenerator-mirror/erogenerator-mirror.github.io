The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian</h4><p><strong>In his whole life, perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression, so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as in this moment. It seemed as though</strong>, without hesitation, he wanted to put both his penis and his mind on something besides the physical pleasure of the pleasure his body was receiving.</p> <p>But that was to be expected because his body had reacted to it just a few minutes earlier, and it certainly had not turned into a mad, sexual lunacy that wanted to experience it so much after just having felt that pleasure. What was different was not just the joy it brought him, but also the profound change in his sexuality from man to boy, a gay man, as in all of the young boys of his years, to, as in the very first words he read in his mind, "I want you so much!"</p> <p>And he meant it, whether the words were intended or not.</p> <p>A little while ago—that is, it seemed as if it couldn't have happened to all its usual self this time, or had it rather sooner—he had been masturbating to the image of him having sex with his wife's cousin at a very young age. At the time it had been merely a very personal dream, but then it had come full circle on some subconscious level.</p> <p>It occurred to him as a teenager that his wife's friend, Nancy, might come close to having sex with her. Not only that, it had been a fantasy of hers, of Nancy, for months, weeks, while her husband, Dan, had been so busy and at work just as busy too, but also to be in a similar fantasy with her.</p> <p>Now that it was actually happening, the fact that Nancy had agreed that Dan would be there as well, while Dan would be away, and maybe have sex with the two of them a little, he really, really wanted it to happen so badly, it was very hard to keep his hands off of himself.</p> <p>He had also found the idea so exciting, although he knew it, as now, he wasn't actually thinking about it very much.</p> <p>As if he was, in fact, being an active participant, as well, all he was now thinking about was his sex with his cousin.</p> <p>"You know, Franz," Nancy had said over the phone on that one particular evening, after she'd been talking to him for a moment or two, "I can think how much I love Dan's penis. It looks so nice hanging there, like it's hanging out of the grass somewhere... And with those balls hanging so low—like their little bumps in the front, like it's in the soil. And it seems, from time to time when they get this great size, when he gets this hard—but then he just keeps fucking me with his penis... Maybe this won't do it for me either, it sounds too good to be true."</p> <p>Even if it didn't work out for both of them—and even if it did, Franz didn't think that he could keep taking steps in this direction.</p> <p>And if he didn't, would he even really want to? He didn't know what he would do if he suddenly started acting out this fantasy in his head—it just occurred to him that somehow it was possible. But was there really anybody else there who felt the same?</p> <p>It would then go no further. At least, that's what it would be—no other discussion—no other discussion about his feelings, but just an actual sex scene—a scenario.</p> <p>As much, if not more, than having sex with Nancy, he wouldn't think about it for a long time after that, except that at first it was just as exciting doing it... and having it, while having it, while having it, while having it.</p> <p>In his youth, Franz had masturbated like that quite often and certainly not so much for her. He thought he was pretty good at it too. Sometimes it would be all he was doing at once, when having sex, in fact, it was so much more than he did for, he knew in his mind's eye—instead, he would be thinking about all the different ways some things felt good and others felt... and some things felt even better. As though they were really connected to each other: the way that his erection, which he was still carrying, actually kind of felt, and the way Nancy's hand felt with her warm, soft hand on his penis.</p> <p>It was all so very very, very, intimate and naughty and sexy. When he had sex with Nancy, it had been with Nancy's friend. When she, however, had sex with him, it had been with a friend of hers—it had been with Dan, it had been with one of Dan's best girlfriends.</p> <p>"I'm just so happy! Having sex with you," he had said.</p> <p></p> <p>This was now more than just what they actually did. "I'm so nice. Yes. yes. yes.</p> <p>yes.</p> <p>good.</p> <p>yes more—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
