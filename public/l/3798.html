As soon as he left the lecture theatre he took my hand, pulled me up from the seat and held me and carried me over to our sofa. We kissed long and deep, our faces pressing against each other almost painfully; we needed to stop; but it was hard to find lips against mine.</p> <p>"No, baby," I whispered, pulling back from his embrace, "you must not."</p> <p>"What do you mean," he whispered back, and after taking my hand and kissing it again he pulled me over toward the wall, kissed my breast and slowly went down my stomach and between my legs.</p> <p>A hand on my breast caused all kinds of naughty thoughts to race through me; maybe it was the lecture, or the kiss, or just the fact I was still wearing the white bra underneath, but the sensation of the other person touching my nipple sent my pulse into overdrive.</p> <p>I was trembling all over, almost ready to cum, and without the bra on my hardened nipples rubbed along the wall and into the wall as his finger gently brushed against my clit. He took it out gently and smiled; he had heard my voice and wanted this. He smiled, pulled me closer to the wall and kissed me.</p> <p>"I'm very ready," I said in a voice so soft that I could hardly make out him over the noise he was making; the only thing I could make out on my own. His hand, his lips, his finger, the wall, everything in between, sent shivers through my entire body. It felt so right. It felt divine. I didn't know when we first met and neither of us ever even had the thoughts for our relationship again.</p> <p>As we kissed my hand was still holding the back of his head, forcing his mouth over my breast and nipple. When his hand was on my leg I could feel myself almost cumming, and almost there.</p> <p>"Not yet," he said, as he kept on kissing my breast; my heart was hammering so fast that it was almost painful; "we have to stop this."</p> <p>"No," I told him; "we have to fuck."</p> <p>"You make no noise," he said; and he lifted my leg to bring his mouth so gently against my pussy which was still wet and so warm. "I'm not going to fuck you," he said, and I saw stars in my head as he ran his tongue over my lips before plunging his tongue inside my folds. "I'm going to fuck you," he growled softly.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I whispered to myself; then I saw him look up at me and nod slightly.</p> <p>"That's an answer."</p> <p>"Yes," I smiled.</p> <p>I turned my head and my lips met his gently and I opened my eyes. "Do you love me," I asked him, even though he wouldn't answer.</p> <p>"Are you sure," he said, as he licked me again, "because it would be like fucking a virgin again!"</p> <p>I moaned loudly at that.</p> <p>"What do you want, baby?" he asked.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me in every hole and on every part of my body," I said, "and I would give myself to you."</p> <p>"And your mouth is going to be a perfect place for fucking me too," he said, and then he was kissing me again.</p> <p>I reached to my knees and held his head between my hands as he licked my pussy.</p> <p>The first thing I felt was him spreading apart my legs and slipping a finger into me. I moaned a little as he found my G-spot and began rhythmically fucking me with his finger. The feeling I got when his finger was going inside me was like the first time I ever had a cock inside me was like this. I reached down and cupped his cock while he fingered me, and my mouth fell open when I remembered that the way his tongue felt sliding over my clit I had a wonderful opportunity to fuck myself.</p> <p>It felt so good, but I needed more, I needed some real fucking, so I turned away from him and leaned back against the sofa, and he followed me with his finger still inside me. It felt so good, I never wanted it to end. When it did it did that feeling that it does when you are ready and then you want as much as you can to hold back as long as you can.</p> <p>"I love fucking you," he told me, as he started finger fucking me, his tongue going into my cunt again, and I was starting to buck against him.</p> <p>"I love you, J," I told him, and he put his finger still moving inside me.</p> <p></p> <p>I started to fuck it again like I am going inside my pussy I was going to say 'fuck'</p> <p>inâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
