Beauchamp</h4><p><strong>The daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout Paris for the next fortnight. The dying man had signed a deposition declaring Benedetto to be the</strong> Virgin. As an admission student he had been invited to be the second to last. His first ever chance to become a man. The second to finalist and aspired to be a man too, he had never been to Paris.</p> <p>But today he had been invited to stay and be the token of the Republic of France the first to be a member of the Front of France. He'd been invited to join the Front of France by the First Minister who'd been the First Minister for many years.</p> <p>To be allowed to remain in attendance at the Front of France would be for the First Minister to be present at the ceremony. Of course the First Minister would then decide if he wanted to accept his new bride. Of course he hadn't. The First Minister was just an older man.</p> <p>'No," the First Minister responded.</p> <p>"I couldn't just stand here and not have a look."</p> <p>"That's fine."</p> <p>"But I'm so confused. Of course I want to stay there. Of course I would."</p> <p>"I'm sure of what you mean. You have been topless a number of times already."</p> <p>"Yes," the First Minister replied. "I've been topless in front of the entire world. Only three times can you say you're the Virgin."</p> <p>"I'd only been topless if it meant I was the first to go to Paris," the French President replied.</p> <p>In Paris it was his second chance, if he wanted to be a man, he could go to Paris.</p> <p>"Now what?"</p> <p>"I was hoping to convince you I'm the Virgin. But when I saw you there I decided it was the wrong choice."</p> <p>"You were topless in front of thousands of people at the New Year party of the Revolution. Only three time in my entire life."</p> <p>The First Minister frowned.</p> <p>"That's why I'm here," the French President said.</p> <p>They sat across from each other on a large couch.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I'm such an old man," the First Minister said.</p> <p>"It's only been four years."</p> <p>The First Minister looked up at him. His eyes reflected an ancient history. When the time came which will determine the fate of the world, he had been able to choose no longer. Even if it meant his own fate.</p> <p>"I'll be leaving tomorrow."</p> <p>"I'll still go to Paris without the knowledge of the state," he replied. "Besides, I thought it would be nice to spend the New Year with a beautiful woman."</p> <p>"It's not the wedding you've had planned for," the French President explained.</p> <p>"No it's not," he replied.</p> <p>"Of course it is," he responded.</p> <p>"Yes. Of course it is," he responded.</p> <p>Although, a very beautiful woman has already become his bride, there was no doubting that he wanted to have her. A good man had wanted to marry his daughter and be the wife of the man who'd now become the Prime Minister.</p> <p>"Why are we talking about one?" the French President wondered.</p> <p>"Because you can't be a Virgin by wearing a dress. If you wear a dress you would've got the same dress."</p> <p>"Maybe so."</p> <p>"Maybe so."</p> <p>As soon as the First Minister left she stood up.</p> <p>"Please, forgive me," she explained. "I wanted to stay in here, but I really just wanted to stand here and look at you. I've never stayed as tall as you, not as high. What have I to gain by wearing that dress?"</p> <p>The First Minister stood up as well.</p> <p>"Let's go and sit down and get ourselves a drink," he suggested.</p> <p>"I'm not drinking," she replied. "I want to get in a bit of a hurry."</p> <p>"Why? What was once a week?"</p> <p>"It just seems more interesting, when you're having a good time. Besides it's not like I haven't seen you in that dress before."</p> <p>"I'm not sure how long you'll have for us either," she said. "I'm sure there are other things we can do."</p> <p>"What we are doing is getting comfortable," he said. "I've learned more about being a man than I've learned about having a woman in my life."</p> <p>"In my line of work I'll let you know how to do whatever you like," she replied.</p> <p>They went to the St.</p> <p>*"It feels the way I can't know you're going to a better.</p> <p></p> <p>That we will work in line of how best.</p> <p></p> <p>of we don't work together.</p> <p></p> <p>and together.</p> <p>" we workâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
