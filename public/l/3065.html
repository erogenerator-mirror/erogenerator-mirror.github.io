Remember our Bible, for instance, in those verses.)</p> <p>The first fuck went great. We were still talking, even with every inch of it. And that first fuck was no better than the one before. We still fucked again, as if we'd been doing it a long time. There was no feeling of the rush of the first fuck. We were already there. This was heaven or hell or whatever. Heaven or hell or whatever, in each case. And fuck, was no feeling like that. We fucked, and fucked and fucked. Not every fuck, but that many times, and again.</p> <p>We fucked, and fucked, and fucked. No fucking back then, but the fucking was wonderful and the fucking was wild, so, as a matter of fact, there was nothing else that could be in the past.</p> <p>Yes, God is God. You were born to be Jesus? Are you, Satan? You can be Satan, too? Oh God, how I have sinned! So, do I, Satan? I am not a God. I am, a devil. I am a devil.</p> <p>So, when we are fucking that night, after you've made me a promise that I shall not lie over again, I've given you an opportunity to tell me your deepest, darkest, most private, most sexual, and most precious secret, your dirty, forbidden, secret, because you are Satan now, you are not Satan. You are Satan. All other animals are Satan. All other animals, like the devil themselves, are Satan. We know when the time is right, which is when we can no longer hold back our passion, and we go further.</p> <p>"Oh, God," was all I muttered in total, without words, knowing that I must. "Fuck me harder." At hearing all of your words, I felt my cock, when it was fully, and fully inside your hot, wet, sucking pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, God," was all the last thing you said, at last and then.</p> <p>You were right. We can't get enough of each other. We are forever. Yes, and as long as you don't ask and make rules of your own, when we aren't fucked, not fucking, not ever being fucked, we can fuck.</p> <p>It is what we are and why we are. There are no labels for us to distinguish or distinguish between us. We are God's loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
