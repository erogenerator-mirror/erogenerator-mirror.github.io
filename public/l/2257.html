THE AVENGING ANGELS.</h4><p><strong>ALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope’s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them</strong> to reach the top of the mountain and back. They had no choice but to make this an unforgettable journey. Hope would make love to her son after this adventure, but every once in a while she would have an equally amazing climax.</p> <p>He moved towards her and embraced her to press her breast into his chest and stroke her side with his fingertips. His erect penis pressed against her hip as he hugged her tightly. Their lips met softly by their mutual secretions. He was on all fours as he entered her again and began to pump away. Hope took a small, tentative step and her tongue found his, intertwining with his. She felt his urgency as he continued to fill and spill his lust until their bodies were locked tightly together. Neither gave a thought to the other’s presence. The warmth and wetness of their naked bodies, pressed together as one sent chills to the other’s brain.</p> <p>Finally she said, “I want…” and with a smile she continued. He rose from the bed and stepped back to her. His rigid cock was still pressed against her pussy and he pushed it into her gently to test the tightness. Her lips were open and he could feel her heat on him. “I feel like I’m going to explode.” He whispered.</p> <p>She raised her arm and said, “Then I’ll let you…” Her words fell short as tears came to her eyes. He grabbed hold of one of her slender, naked breasts and began to roll and pull upon her nipple, causing waves of ecstasy that had been building for decades. She squirmed her ass into him to add to the sensations he was creating. His mouth descended upon her ear and slowly licked the sensitive flesh there. His hand dropped to her stomach to explore the smoothness of her pubic hair and the soft mound that sat hidden underneath it, but never revealed itself. She squirmed some more, pressing herself against the hardness between their bodies. As he caressed her body, she became increasingly more daring.</p> <p>She lifted her legs to open herself even more to his caresses as he took the opportunity to move them up toward his torso. He moved his mouth further up her neck, down to her cleavage and to her shoulders. He began to lick at her neck and shoulders, first one and then the other. Her mouth found his and they locked into an ecstatic frenzy of passion. Their lips and tongues mingled in one way or another. Her arms raised from the bed with the intention of pulling him deeper into her. She moved her hips towards him and pressed herself against him as her body writhed out of control. For the first time in her life, Hope wanted to be one with him, to be with him as a lover.</p> <p>The passion that had built to this point increased as he continued to drive his prick into her with the ferocity of a jackhammer. He reached around to squeeze her ass with his hand. She reached up and grabbed hold of his face, pulling him deep into her. She loved his urgency. She wanted to enjoy his every thrust as long as she could. A few moments ago she had come twice by the time they reached the top of the mountain. Now they were both on the way to the ultimate peak of sexual perfection. Their bodies writhed around one another, almost as one in rhythm with their mouths. They could no longer contain themselves; their excitement rose towards the pinnacle of the most powerful orgasm anyone can imagine. They continued to stroke one another through their orgasmic bliss. As he kept pumping away into her, trying to prolong the ultimate blissful feeling, she could feel and feel his climax starting to build. Within ten seconds or so, she could feel her own orgasm nearing.</p> <p>As their orgasms calmed to a near standstill, Hope felt like she was floating on a raft. She could feel her body trembling as it reached the very end of its journey to the peak of ultimate satisfaction. It was as if she was floating on the ocean and then it hit her at that exact instant. She could feel its hot, pulsing power as it moved through her to her toes. The momentary silence that would eventually destroy any moment of their unravelling was long gone. She had enjoyed being fucked in this way for the past three months. She was going to enjoy it even more for the following weeks.</p> <p>After her orgasm had ended, she rose to get dressed once again. She had wanted to continue their passion without the guilt that would inevitably follow. Now the guilt had been replaced by anticipation and anticipation of further fucking her son. He would love what might happen. She was certain that he would love taking her again. But at the moment he had to do more than that. It was time enough in order. As he walked her out of his cock into the bathroom and she stood waiting for her return to kiss her son to shower, she closed her bedroom—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
