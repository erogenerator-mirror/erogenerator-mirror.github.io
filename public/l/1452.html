It was now summer, and she was home for the first time in nearly six years.</p> <p>Till now she was twenty-and-one; she'd begun her internship at a local college in the spring, and she loved it.</p> <p>A week prior, she was working in the mailroom at the local library. It had opened up an empty hall, with a few of the shelves overflowing its stacks, but she couldn't quite work that far. She had to turn and go into a nearby restroom, but this was too awkward, and she just stood there, staring out into the back room to see if anyone caught her staring. At first she didn't register the sight, but then a second later the thought struck her and she realized she was staring. Her eyes widened in embarrassment, she turned beet red, and she quickly backed up.</p> <p>"Oh my gosh," she stuttered, "you see-in here?!" she whispered, "What's wrong?"</p> <p>But before she could speak the boy was back, and he was now stroking his huge dick, which was now glistening with her saliva. He had a thick, uncircumcised dick, and he leaned over her and began to lick it.</p> <p>She gasped. "Holy crap!" she muttered. Then she began to squirm, almost frantically. "Ooohh, fuck, that," she finally moaned.</p> <p>He continued to lick, and suddenly realized what she meant. He licked and sucked. With a look of shock on her face, he lifted his head up, and her eyes never left his as he pulled off his pants.</p> <p>Now her pussy was wet and waiting for him. He moved back up her body, kissing her, licking her face and neck as he went.</p> <p>"Oh God," she moaned into his mouth as he licked her breasts. While he licked, he pushed her legs over her chest and thrust his dick against the inside of her thigh. It went into her pussy quickly, and she felt his hard dick press against her.</p> <p>He put it in one stroke, and started to fuck her. "God, it's so big!" she moaned, as he pulled out and rammed it back in again, again and again.</p> <p>He had only done her tits before, but it didn't feel like this. It was something completely new, being fucked over and over. It felt like he was inside of her, and she didn't understand it at first, but then she was lost to orgasm, and when she came she was overcome. Her hips came off the floor, and she held on for dear life, as he rode her and pumped into her.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she moaned, "yes! Oh yeah! Fuck me, fuck me harder!"</p> <p>She saw stars and he had his hand on her hips as he kept pumping his cock in and out.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum! Don't stop! I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>He was so close to her, but she didn't care.</p> <p>His cock was spurting, and her pussy was squeezing him like a vice. He began to moan as she felt him pulse within her. She collapsed as he slumped on her, completely spent. She looked up at him, but couldn't feel her breathing and then realized it.</p> <p>He leaned forward, kissing her again, as he rolled off to the side.</p> <p>She thought she couldn't feel anyone else, or anyone for that matter.</p> <p>He reached up to a book shelf to put it on. He held his hand to his mouth, and a minute later, a light was flashing above him. "Fuck!" he almost shouted, startling her.</p> <p>Now all she could do was gasp, "Oh my God, what the fuck did I ever do!"</p> <p>But, he was not angry. "Don't ask me that question," he told her, "but I'm not really mad. I knew I shouldn't have done this."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I heard you correctly," she replied. She didn't say he'd been angry, though. She knew he'd been, because he'd gotten up, took his pants off and was standing in the doorway. He was naked; he never needed to be. He came out of the house with a blanket tossed over him.</p> <p>"I knew I shouldn't have come so quick," he said. "But I did." He turned and kissed her.</p> <p>This time she didn't want to put an end to the sex between them. She was getting to the sex session, it.</p> <p>They c c- I'll have sex... sex... sex</p> <p>- love... sex, she said sex</p> <p>- said nothing she- good sexâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
