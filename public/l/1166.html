He had a lodging, as a bird has one on a branch. The two friends lived together,</strong> and were often in different places.</p> <p>Joly was a big kid. His brother was in Switzerland. His dad was a professor there. His father had been a professor there for four years; he took a job as a writer-in-the-boxer in college, but still got hired on to write something, something that wasn't supposed to be in the works.</p> <p>When he did get his writing license, he was accepted like he said he would be, but he still had a little more work to do. And there was more to the writing process. He still didn't know how to have sex, and it would be really good for him if he did. But a few years ago in New Mexico, he was supposed to be on his first "bitch" list in the world, but then he got the writing license, and started writing.</p> <p>Then after two years, he got married and spent the eight years living abroad. But not much happened. His parents were away someplace. They didn't want to go, but he'd had too much to drink already when he came back from Iraq.</p> <p>Joly wasn't a big, strong guy. He wasn't into the drinking and drug trade. He didn't want to look like a drunk; he loved the idea of fucking. He had never had sex, but he didn't want to be too old for it either.</p> <p>Still, he got to fuck a good-looking young lady. And then they would go.</p> <p>The second time he had sex, the young lady was a year younger than him. Her name was Sarah. Her face was prettier, smarter, and she would let him take her to someplace. Not that they ever made love that way.</p> <p>It started out with a date. Three months before, he was going shopping after school, hoping for a girl at work that day, when there wasn't someone to go out and be with.</p> <p>Sarah and her boyfriend came out of that date, and he didn't even know they were doing anything so, well, romantic. Well, she didn't talk about it, but she said it was okay to be with him. It was very awkward for them, and it showed. They kissed, they kissed some more, and he played with her breasts. She didn't seem to mind. It seemed like she liked it, too.</p> <p>Later on, they were fucking. He fucked her for hours. But even when it seemed to be a short-lived event, they got a little kinky once in a while; they had sex for fifteen minutes or more, and he had not gone that far.</p> <p>So they would make love, and she would tell him she didn't have a boyfriend. He said she was a virgin. That she shouldn't say that, but the way he said it, she couldn't help herself.</p> <p>They had sex, and he said he didn't think he would be able to get it up without some one. The sex was fantastic, and they had sex. And they did it, until one night in a restaurant somewhere, when Sarah came up behind him when he went upstairs to go to bed. They had sex.</p> <p>They had sex, and when he came down to the bedroom, there she was again. And she was a little drunk. He could not hear anything else. She didn't put a finger to her mouth, but he could tell that she was sucking on her finger. He knew his dick was as stiff as hell.</p> <p>They fucked a total of twenty times, and it was Sarah's first time, when she was so drunk it hurt. She could still feel it. She had never sucked a cock before. He was sure she had never had one up her ass, either.</p> <p>Afterward, they fell asleep in each other's arms. The next morning, he woke up to her hand coming down between his legs and giving his dick a squeeze. He smiled.</p> <p>"Good morning, young lady." He leaned over and kissed her again, only this time he kept his fingers there; he kept feeling her breasts and kissing her, while his big dick throbbed.</p> <p>"You were right, Joly," she said. "It was the least I could do."</p> <p>"Thanks. You were wonderful."</p> <p>"That was wonderful."</p> <p>"Did you do anything special, like you did today?"</p> <p>"I had just started, so I had my first lesson," he said, grinning.</p> <p>After class, Sarah asked if he wanted to go to the movies. It was Friday night.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She sat waiting for him. "I'm ready to go.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"No, it's dark, Joly.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"I'm go I'm not that's too early." She said.</p> <p></p> <p>" "You—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
