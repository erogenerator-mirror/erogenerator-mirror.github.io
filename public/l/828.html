"You know I love the way it fits so nicely on me. You know that you should've worn it at least once a week before we split up," he grinned. "It's quite nice."</p> <p>I rolled my gown up and over my head. It was still cold outside anyway and the cold wind was now giving my naked body a tingle. It was not just the cold, it was the fact that I didn't have any underwear on!</p> <p>"Come on," he insisted. "Don't tease me. We've had a lovely holiday, you've hardly seen me naked."</p> <p>I walked across to the bed and climbed on it. He climbed on board next to me and the warmth of his body pressing against my naked skin. I turned to kiss him. The feel of his naked body against mine was making my arousal grow. "Don't say a word," he said. He pressed himself down against me, his hips rubbing against mine. "Let me make love to you," he said.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" I replied, taking his face into my hands and kissing him hard on the lips. I rolled him over so that he lay on his back with his naked body underneath me. I straddled his face. He licked my thighs over my thong, and I moaned in delight. I spread my legs, and he licked me, not even hesitating in his quest. I writhed with pleasure under his eager tongue and he pressed his face deeper into me when I came.</p> <p>He helped me off of him completely. He kissed and sucked my face, and kissed and licked my neck and breasts. Then he sucked my nipples, and then he kissed and nibbled the entire of my left tit, and I was in heaven! He sucked and sucked and nibbled the whole of my tit, his chin brushing my sensitive nipple.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I sighed. "Oh, yes. Yes."</p> <p>"Do you like watching me suck your tits?" he asked. He bit my nipple lightly with his teeth, and I squealed.</p> <p>"Yes," I breathed.</p> <p>"Yes what?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes please," I asked.</p> <p>"Your tits are beautiful," he said.</p> <p>As he sucked a nipple between his teeth, I stroked my right nipple and I loved the feel of his stubble. He sucked my other breast and then he nibbled my left nipple, sending shivers through me.</p> <p>"I think we'll take care of that while you watch. It's such a beautiful day," he said. He kissed me and I kissed him. He moved off of me and lay down beside me. We kissed again, my hands wandering all over his body and he kissed the insides of my cheeks, my lips, and my ears. He slid a long finger into my pussy and then moved it in and out as we kissed.</p> <p>"You know how to make me squirt," I said. I opened my thighs to accommodate him as he slid his finger inside me and I came. He withdrew his finger and put an arm around me and hugged me, kissing me. We lay there on the bed, just gazing at each other, still caressing each other. After a few minutes, he said: "I love you." I just held him and said, "I love youâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
