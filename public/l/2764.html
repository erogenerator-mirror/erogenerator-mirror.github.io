OF THOSE THINGS THAT WEAKEN, OR TEND TO THE DISSOLUTION OF</h4><p><strong>A COMMON-WEALTH Dissolution Of Common-wealths Proceedeth From Imperfect Institution Though nothing can be immortall, which mortals make; yet, if men had the use of reason they pretend to, their Common-wealths</strong> would never be destroyed.</p> <p>Wealthies and power-plays have had their moments in time, but not here. The commoner who lived on Earth had lived on her Earth. Now she lived on Earth and had gone on her long and lovely voyage. It was time to start living.</p> <p>"Fuck me, you Bastard!"</p> <p>The man laughed. "You'll have to forgive me, but I'm ready. I'm ready for my cum," He grinned smugly, and he gave a roar of joy.</p> <p>A human being? How could it be a joke? No human being capable of such happiness. It was time for someone to make a name for himself, to become his lover. His name had been "Bobby"; his first name had been "Bobby" and he had had his name with his name on his shirt. He had wanted to be a name to say, "What an idiot you are". For some reason he was happy.</p> <p>The man leaned over to a table in the corner, and pulled out a set of condoms. He took out a packet and squirted some of the liquid onto the condom, but he could only put it out of his erection for one heartbeat-- he was so aroused it felt like someone had poured oil on the whole back of his hand, so as to not make the man hurt himself. The man leaned towards the table, and opened a condom wrapper in his hand; he pushed his tongue into it, and took out a condom, as well. He put a second packet into his mouth as well, and rolled the condom down.</p> <p>He was so aroused that this time he had to masturbate. He sat the condom on the table and, again on the table, spread the spread. This time he got on the table and lifted his legs. He lay down next to the man. He lifted a leg over his head, and guided his cock into the man's mouth, and into the condom. The man took his cock in his mouth, while the man sucked him.</p> <p>The man was a human man, an average man with brown hair and green eyes. The man had long, thick hair. The man was a virgin. His name had been "Bobby"; his second name had been "Bobby". He was a male. He had come to be a man. Now he was a woman. He was going to be a woman. He was such a good lover. He had come to love a man.</p> <p>Bobby's cock hardened in the man's mouth-- he felt it against his face. He turned his head forward, and tried to get closer to its mate. The man, his face buried in the wet pussy, licked the swollen head of his cock, licking the wetness from the shaft, and his tongue moved down the shaft and across the base.</p> <p>Bobby's heart pounded and beat faster and faster as his cock went into the man's mouth.</p> <p>"Yes," Bobby moaned as his own pleasure rushed through him. "That's it. Yes. Yes! Bobby was the only one who had touched him there, only the one woman who made him cum. Bobby. You're the best fuck I've ever had."</p> <p>"Bobby? Bobby?"</p> <p>"Mhmm?"</p> <p>Bobby moved forward a little, and the man moved back. Bobby looked over with pleasure at the human woman he'd just made love to. His cock was throbbing against an almost painfully erect penis.</p> <p>The man didn't seem to object when Bobby's cock came free with a wet slurp. He smiled back at Bobby, and the man returned his smile. Bobby knew then he had done it. He had made his lover a woman. "That's it, Bobby, fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me forever."</p> <p>Bobby felt his own orgasm rising. The man's own voice was the only sound, as he moved himself to the side of the table and put his condom on again. Bobby got on the table, bent over, and pulled himself up on the table. He moved his legs in and around the table seat, and slid in a little further, his cock now pressed up against the face of the woman. "Fuck me, Bobby. Oh, fuck me, fuck me with your dick!"</p> <p>"Not yet, girl. You're too nice to be fucked with a dick."</p> <p>Bobby moved down to the woman's clitoris and pressed the tip of his tongue against it. "Oh, yes." She moaned quietly.</p> <p>"I'm ready," the man's. and . -what!" a deep. and -I'll! and and and -I'll !" and and -I've and then . and andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
