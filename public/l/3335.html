English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXXVIII. The Ass-Festival.</h4><p><strong>At length, in the middle of their feast, Zarathustra bursts in upon them and rebukes them soundly. But he does not do so long; in the Ass-Festival, it suddenly occurs</strong> to him that in that first few moments together they would be lovers. He tries to control his voice to remain steady, but there is a husky groan and he is struck dumb with pleasure.</p> <p>The first sex they share, the first time she asks him to, is one of the most memorable events of their existence. Their bodies melt into each other. Zarathustra leans back and throws her head back, and he begins ravishing her. He can feel his tongue and lips touching places no man had touched before. He is amazed at how erotic it tastes, how full and tight her pussy is. He can feel his own dick grow larger and he tries to hide it, but at the moment he is losing the battle between his desire to lick and suck and suck her and his determination to be the one that finally releases them both in that moment.</p> <p>After a few minutes of ravishing her, Zarathustra senses his climax. She presses her cunt against his face, driving his tongue deeper into her. He tries to reach, but to no avail, she keeps pushing him away.</p> <p>She rises a little off of him so that they are both facing each other. She lowers her lips to his ear, and gives him a sweet, lusty kiss. She whispers, "My lover is happy. He is happy for us." She laughs then, and pats his buttocks. "Well, lover," she purrs, "you have been a very good toy so far! Your new owner will surely be excited beyond his wildest imagination! Isn't that right, lover?" That's the first time the word "frightened beyond wildest imagination" comes up from Zarathustra, and she is the first to respond. She is very pleased.</p> <p>"I want to play now," she says simply. And she is not joking. She leads him to her bed, her dress flung off onto the floor, a couple of blankets pulled over the side and a couple of pillows. Then she kisses him on the mouth, her mouth open, her hands on his dick. He reaches for her and she pushes him back, lays down on the bed on her front.</p> <p>"Lie down and watch, lover," she croons.</p> <p>The room is dark; the only light coming is from the lamp on her dresser. The man kneeling on the floor looks just like Zarathustra, he is big, a good looker; he has a beard; and he is a bit of a hunk. She kisses her way up along his hard belly toward his groin, and he watches with avid and eager eyes as she opens his dick and takes it into her mouth. The penis is huge, but it is thick and hard and hard and hard and hard and hard. He is completely erect. A small drop of precum is seeping from his cock. She looks down at him in ecstasy and says, "Yes, lover; you're the one who will make me happy, you lucky man." She begins sucking him up and down, laving his balls with her tongue, her mouth open and her face smeared in his precum.</p> <p>The man on his back suddenly gasps. He tries to get up but she pushes him back down again. She kisses his chest and shoulders, licking up and down the column of skin above the dick, her tongue on the sensitive underside and his balls. Then she opens her mouth and sucks them down her throat until he can see and taste the sides of her lips as they kiss the shaft and it moves and twitches and it throbs and it glows. Finally she lifts her face to her lover and begins kissing his chest, sucking it and it twitches and it squirms and twitches and it glows and it glows and it shines and it glows and it glows and it gleams and it shines and it glowed and it glowed and it glowed like the sun.</p> <p>Then she goes back down her throat, and his penis throbs as she does, throbbing and pulsing and as it grows she goes up and down, lashing his cock and his testicles and then she's fucking his dick with her soft, warm mouth. He puts his hands to her cheeks and she releases them, and he pulls her toward him until he can suck on her nipples while his tongue strokes her pussy.</p> <p>Suddenly Zarathustra pulls herself up and off his penis. "That's enough," she says. "I'm dying to do something with you, lover, but I don't think you'd like your dick sucked. Now please stand up. It's time for you to fuck my cunt..."</p> <p>The man standing up is much smaller than he seems. He is perhaps six two inches, and maybe three-quarters weightless and it fits almost like he was, but not thick but not big around, not thick but not too small. He's small but not to be a littleâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
