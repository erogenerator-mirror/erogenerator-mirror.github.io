Officer Wilson would be taken inside that room, and then taken out of sight by the Headmaster.</p> <p>Officer Wilson saw his mother walking towards the old officers, holding her skirts down her legs and pulling up the hem in a most unkind manner.</p> <p>"Oh God. I can't believe I'd want to see such a beautiful looking naked thing like that, now that I think about it."</p> <p>"Please stop it. We can do better than this. You know you like it. It's got a very nice body it hasn't got a problem."</p> <p>Her tone left no room for argument in being so coarse, and he felt his cock twitch as she spoke.</p> <p>"It's a very fine specimen," she continued. "It's quite a piece of young man meat."</p> <p>"Is that what you call your foreskin?"</p> <p>"Yes and everything has a lovely shape to it. I used to masturbate at that time, when you wouldn't come. It's what I would call a lovely pair of balls or something."</p> <p>"So many different ways to make a young man squirm."</p> <p>"Come now. We only have an hour and you'll have a chance to play with your thing."</p> <p>"What, in that position? We're in the library."</p> <p>"Nonsense. It's been a delightful hour, and it'll last for a long time."</p> <p>"You won't regret it."</p> <p>She put her hand on top of his crotch and squeezed, and she gave it a good squeeze.</p> <p>"Does it feel good? That's all you are going to do for what seems like an eternity, with no touch, no action. You don't even touch yourself, let alone give you any sensations. Maybe you couldn't stand a day without a little action. Maybe it would be better if you didn't do it often."</p> <p>She lifted her hand from his groin and brought it to her mouth. He watched her with longing, not able to tell if she was sucking his penis or looking into his face. He didn't care. She kissed the top of it, running her mouth very lightly across the top. It felt so good to think he did it to please her. He ran his fingers through her short but beautiful hair, and pulled her up and kissed her on the mouth.</p> <p>After a brief moment of kissing, she removed his pants, and then he did up the collar of her dress.</p> <p>"That looks so nice."</p> <p>"Do you want it? Have any of these things you should have before marriage. It takes a lot of finesse to get it."</p> <p>"You don't think it's necessary? This thing is going to be a bit of a sore subject and it looks like it'll spoil your surprise in the morning."</p> <p>She laughed. "I've heard of the saying 'don't tell anyone you're thinking to do anything, but it's best you didn't."</p> <p>"Well, I'm going to spoil it just as soon as I get my cock back up again."</p> <p>She pushed him back down on the couch. She had just finished pulling down her panties. She put them on the floor beside him.</p> <p>"I suppose you want all this to get into your mind so you don't start worrying about what you're wearing when I come in the room."</p> <p>"Don't be silly. I thought it was going to be OK. Don't worry."</p> <p>"Just tell me the right time."</p> <p>She took his penis in one hand, and the head of it in the other. He looked down as she massaged the foreskin up and down.</p> <p>"It feels lovely to feel and touch and to be touched up by a woman so. It feels lovely to rub the skin between my fingers, and it's quite beautiful to be held in both hands so intimately."</p> <p>"It's not as if you are in a room. Just relax and it doesn't matter. You just let it come alive. Just enjoy it."</p> <p>She brought the head of his penis up to her lips, and slid it to and into her mouth to give it a very sensual blowjob. It felt wonderful to feel the skin of his penis touching against the top of her mouth, and being close to being completely engulfed by the softness of her mouth. The fact that she was still dressed had nothing to do with why and why she hadn't brought her panties on, she had nothing in mind at all. She was enjoying it. She was enjoying putting on a show for a man, well, old man, young officer. She was a young lady.</p> <p>"You see? I'm just start to cum? You can't. I'm just look? it"</p> <p>"And she kept rubbing his penis andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
