His head was aching, the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body, and his mind had</strong> been on something else - his sex life with Miriam. As he stood in the kitchen preparing breakfast he felt his heart pounding and his stomach feel sick. He had felt dirty and cheap, his sexuality was out of control, but now he felt like a prostitute, was she really there and would he be able to fuck her in the same room?</p> <p>Pierre got up from the table and went to the window beside the kitchen. He turned on the light and he realised he had no idea of what was going on outside. He left the room.</p> <p>Later that night Pierre watched TV.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Miriam woke her son, "Good morning sunshine!"</p> <p>"Good morning," Pierre whispered, and kissed her, "It's been a long time since I woke, and I love the way my hair looks, darling."</p> <p>Miriam smiled, "You're so quiet, don't you know," and she leaned back against his chest, "You feel so good with me."</p> <p>Pierre cupped her breast squeezing her nipples between his fingers and thumb, "I love you, Miriam," he whispered hoarsely.</p> <p>"I love you too, my sweet Pierre."</p> <p>They kissed once more; their tongues touched, touched each other, caressed, kissed, kissed.</p> <p>While they shared a long languorous kiss he felt a hand on his leg, "I'm back to bed," Miriam thought.</p> <p>Miriam gently pushed Pierre onto his back beside her. She slid downwards and ran her hands up his body, and her hands rubbed his hard penis through his trousers. Pierre moaned and he kissed her again.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes," she whispered, "God I want you!"</p> <p>Mira took in the scene of their love making and then she pushed her hand towards Pierre's lap, he turned on his side and she straddled his hips sliding her wet pussy just past the top of his cock. Miriam rubbed his penis with her hand while she rocked her hips grinding against Pierre's dick. Pierre looked up at her with those big beautiful eyes which told him everything!</p> <p>"My beautiful Miriam," he whispered, "you feel so good, I can hardly stand it," he stroked her breasts, "I'm not sure I can."</p> <p>Her eyes were wide; they were staring into his for a million years and he wanted more. He pulled himself upward. Miriam looked down at his hard dick; she looked so hot against his body and she took his cock in her hand and slowly she pulled him down on top of her. Pierre moved his dick between her pussy lips; he slowly slid his penis all the way in. Miriam moaned and moaned while he moved his hips against hers. He pushed deeper into her, holding himself in position while she rubbed his penis.</p> <p>Miriam kissed Pierre's lips and cheek, "God that's good, so good," she whispered, "Your cock just feels so good in my pussy."</p> <p>"It feels heavenly," Pierre thought.</p> <p>"My sweet Pierre," she said as she rolled Pierre off her, "I want to do something more than just kiss and lick."</p> <p>"Yes," Pierre thought, "Yes, we can do more."</p> <p>Miriam climbed up Pierre's body and kissed him again, then she knelt down and she looked into his eyes, "Look at me while you fuck me," and she put more of Pierre's cock in her mouth. Pierre's eyes widened, and he put his hands on her tits and gently massaged them. Miriam licked and sucked his dick while Pierre moaned while feeling her tongue and lips moving over him. Miriam then bent down and licked his cock from his balls to his pubic hair.</p> <p>"Mmm," Pierre moaned.</p> <p>Miriam pushed a finger against Pierre's anus and she pushed it in, slowly getting it fully inserted inside him. Pierre moaned and pulled her on top of him. Miriam kissed Pierre, kissed his ear and her chest. Pierre's mind was spinning and he looked down on himself at his dick sliding in and out of Miriam's mouth.</p> <p>"Is this what women do for each other?" Pierre asked, "I'm thinking like you."</p> <p>Miriam was stroking his whole body and stroking his cock at the same time. Her big beautiful breasts were so close together and she could feel the hard shaft of Pierre's dick in her hand and her breath on his balls and the shaft on her tongue.</p> <p>"God it feels good, Pierre."</p> <p>"Fuck me," Pierre whispered.</p> <p>"No Pierre," Miriam kissed Pierre's forehead like a lover kisses, "I've got you in for every one more than you." , fuck me." . "Not for a man, just fuck me, a woman." ...," she squeezed both, "just fuck meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
