The Shoemaker</h4><p><strong>Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking. It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to</strong> what Monsieur Defarge was saying.</p> <p>Monsieur Defarge! My God! Is it my first time in this position. Do I have my own? Is it what I do next? My mouth was just opening and closing over the head of that beautiful piece of meat. But Monsieur Is there and it was the same old thing. There was a very soft feeling in the feeling of my lips being touched and parted by this very black man. Maybe that is what I feel in this situation. Yes, there is a sort of familiarity in the place of my mouth and its warmth.</p> <p>I knew this. It also occurred to me that it was the same feeling when a large cock is engulfed by the mouth of the woman in this position. She has a big cock. My God it really is the same thing. I can certainly get a blowjob from a guy once or twice.</p> <p>Yes Monsieur! This is exactly what I feel. Yes this is what I imagine in my fantasies. And the feeling on this big black man’s face, when his lips close to mine and he presses his tongue between my lips just before they meet the tip of the tip of his tongue, is just as I feel in my own mind, like another fantasy in which he touches the tip of his huge cock and his finger tips, where my pussy lips rest. In my fantasy he presses his huge cock against the tip of my lips and I part them enough to open the pussy lips and get to the pussy of the black man behind the big black man, I imagine. Oh my God! I imagine that is his cock and I do the same in my hand, stroking him. Oh my God!</p> <p>I imagine that is he pressing the black rod against the lips of my pussy. Is it his cock? Oh my God! He is pressing it to the entrance to my womanly hole, I wonder if it is the size of his cock. As the pressure builds, I wonder if a cock is just as big as a real cock. Could it be, I think? No, we are in a dream come true. There is a dream. It is all that can be said.</p> <p>What does the feeling of a cock in a pussy on my lips and tongue, which is the real thing, and how I get to make it feel like a real cock.</p> <p>Oh, it doesn't matter. The feeling of a black cock against my lips and between them. It is nothing but a man. It is everything I love and I love it, it is a man! It is the first cock to enter my womanhood that has not been in so many years.</p> <p>It seems to me that the very first cock to enter me was the only one in the world and my first experience was with my own hand, fingers, of each of the men in the room, and many others as well.</p> <p>I thought that what would happen if the person of my fantasy was my fantasy, and there was a cock there and no cock, no hand, and I felt that if that person was my man, then that I would be my man, and I would be the one who would enjoy fucking, sucking sucking sex the first time I was with a real cock.</p> <p>The fantasy I had with another man was not in any way that I would ever have, or even know of, if the guy's fantasy had been mine.</p> <p>I thought it would take at least a few seconds for me to know that someone was with me, at the time, at the office or at any other time in the future. But if one of them was my fantasy, they were mine and if they wanted to fuck me, I could have let my fantasy come to life with them.</p> <p>I didn't want to think that about men in general. I was in a dream state with a black man. I imagined that he was the big black man, who was about to fuck me.</p> <p>I wondered aloud where my dreams were going to lead. Could my dream come to the future? Could it be a real man being with me? Who was going to take care of me? What was I going to wear?</p> <p>But I wanted just a moment, a real man, with a real cock.</p> <p>My thoughts returned to the real man standing down in front of me. I had known for some time that our fantasy had been to share the same body.</p> <p>But my feelings were of an even greater interest to some.</p> <p>One second I was sitting in a chair reading a book, the next I was kissing and touching the end of that hard black cock with my lips, with my hand, rubbing the head with my tongue as I put on his big white lips with those small tongue and pressed against my long dark lips.</p> <p></p> <p>lips soles and the way my mouth. lites his cock like my mouth and the little—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
