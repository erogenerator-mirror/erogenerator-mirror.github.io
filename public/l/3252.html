English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LI. ON PASSING-BY.</h4><p><strong>Thus slowly wandering through many peoples and divers cities, did Zarathustra return by round-about roads to his mountains and his cave. And behold, thereby came he unawares also to the</strong> sight of a beautiful nude woman, lying half on her bed and half on her side. She was fully aroused by now and was clearly loving every minute of this unexpected encounter that they had met that evening.</p> <p>Now she knew why he couldn't tell her, he didn't want to keep the secret from her but he wished to experience something of hers and to bring that to his knowledge by a new experience. It's possible he was too far along for a girl who wasn't willing to be explored sexually, even though he had enjoyed the show.</p> <p>To his surprise and joy she was also lying very still so he wondered to herself of what he'd do if he saw her again in the future. Well, not today after all the time of living, anyway. The days were busy with work at school, the whole time of their lives.</p> <p>And now a beautiful woman who was half naked and enjoying the night was giving him the best pleasure experience that he'd ever had.</p> <p>"Ahhhhh..." she moaned her breath at him, "...ahhh... yes... yes... yes... yes..."</p> <p>Their eyes met and she looked at him with lust and adoration as she said, "...thank you...," again she gave him a kiss on his head. This was going to be a most memorable moment that they had together.</p> <p>She raised up her body and moved her hands and legs to the side so she could feel more, "I don't want to be anywhere but inside." She said in a shy voice.</p> <p>He moved his face closer and kissed her neck softly. She gasped, "Yes... don't stop," as he kissed her on her neck and on her cleavage then she started pushing her body towards his mouth in an effort to feel him inside her. But he was getting impatient and couldn't wait any longer to taste that delicious hotness between her legs.</p> <p>"Please... let me... feel you inside now," She said in a husky voice.</p> <p>She started to move her legs apart and as he moved his face closer she felt a wet patch on her panties as if his tongue had entered it into the wet spot.</p> <p>"Oh yes... please... take me first," She replied in a shaky voice.</p> <p>He parted her thighs with his hands and started moving his face closer and nearer, he was trying for the first time as if he was in heaven, he looked like a wild animal devouring a tasty prey.</p> <p>Then he could feel her hands and feet pressing his shoulders to get to an unimpeded position again. He moved his face back and again took her by surprise as he pressed his head on her lower body so that her wetness became fully visible.</p> <p>"Oh my baby..." She moaned as his hot mouth was envelop on her whole body.</p> <p>He felt the moisture on his face and lips and continued to lick her lips and kiss her mouth in a manner that had become very sensual. She tasted so sweet his mouth was filled with saliva which made it slippery.</p> <p>She was panting now, "Ahh... ahhh.....hmm..."</p> <p>"Yes...yes..." He said looking at her eyes closed with passion.</p> <p>As the kisses became more passionate and her mouth opened to let his tongue enter her salivaty mouth, Zarathustra felt his hands move on hers. He felt her hand behind his head, pulling him closer to her as they kissed. He also felt her legs on the outside of his thighs and one on each side and then he moved his lips down further and started kissing her breasts and licking her skin with his lips.</p> <p>She was moaning constantly and was enjoying herself on his face by now, "mmmmmmmmmmmm..."</p> <p>Then he moved his body away from her to lie on the bed, at the end of the bed.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "yes... please..."</p> <p>He didn't mind, they had reached such an end, as he knew that she'd probably be receptive to his proposal.</p> <p>She smiled a lovely smile as her body stretched out as if she was still in sleep and she gave him a light show by rubbing her hands on his thighs and buttocks.</p> <p>He pulled her on his right side so that she was lying on the bed on her left side. He was looking at her in the face, trying to ascertain whether she was awake or not.</p> <p>She smiled some more and got up from her bed on her other side and lied down, her body still on her stomach. He then turned her body toward him and gave her the best way of entering her by kissing her mouth.</p> <p>She liked it, her smile and his kiss on her lips and the mouth was still, "mmmmmmmmmmmmm... aaaaaaahhhh... ahhh..." not so warm mmmmm." He kissed her mouth.</p> <p>her again. ahhhh his kiss was wet and the kissing and now his mouthâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
