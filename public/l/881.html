I love taking what I want, being desired, because I'm a girl. I can feel your eyes on me as each word you say, hear it, feel it. Your head bobbing up and down, you're enjoying me being with you, my pussy's about to explode, and you know what a whore I am? You know how I'm going to get you to fuck me in the ass?</p> <p>Now that would be great. I'd love to feel your big prick inside me; you'd like it to be buried inside my ass and to feel you cum in there, would you?</p> <p>As I slide into the water and lay down, my legs wide open, you're hard and eager like I've been wanting you to be. I love it with you watching me pleasure myself while you fuck me: the sight of you taking me from behind, my moans as you slide in and out, my gasps as you hit my G-spot and my body's tremulations in response. Your hands are all over me, feeling my body, my thighs, my hands, my skin.</p> <p>We spend a few minutes lying there, me on my back with you on top. That's all it takes. You start to lick it away, then take it into your mouth.</p> <p>I turn around, take off you towel and hand it to you.</p> <p>You take me in your arms and begin to lick and suck my nipples...</p> <p>I love that, all sensitive nipples, one for your mouth. Suck it, bite it, bite it really hard as I moan as you suck, your tongue swirling over them. You suck one at a time, nibbling on my other. You make love to them, with soft, moist, caressing hands.</p> <p>I'm moaning and thrusting against you, my hips writhing against yours, your dick filling me up. You pull my hips up to meet yours so you can drive into me hard, make me scream. I get off to ride your hardness, feel those hard cocks pounding against my pussy, into my ass. You can't get enough. You hold me close, kissing and sucking my face, my neck, sliding your hands down my sides to cup a breast, my ass, my pussy.</p> <p>I spread my legs, so you can feel me squirt all over your thick cock. I rub it against the lips of my pussy; let just the head enter...</p> <p>I turn so you can lick me all over and slide down so you can press his tongue in my ass, to lick me there a little more, to make me feel so good. You're going to make me cum again.</p> <p>You can't take any more, you have to fuck me.</p> <p>Now I'm on my hands and knees, you behind me, spreading my legs, your cock right at my back door. You don't need any lube, you just need me wet for you. I've been ready ever since your cock was in there, the feeling of your hardness on my pussy, the look of your eyes, the warmth of your face, your sweat. I want to feel you come inside me.</p> <p>You put the tip of your prick at my back door and slowly press into me. Fuck me, I want you inside me.</p> <p>My pussy is burning hotter than it has ever been. I grab hold of the arms of that chair and push back into you, and you give in, slowly, steadily, just a little bit at a time. I want every inch of you inside me. You feel so good inside.</p> <p>Soon, we make love in the shower. I am like a wet dream; I want it all over me. I want all of you, your every touch, every sensation. I'm being made love to with your cock in my pussy, in my ass. It's not every day I get to do those things together, and I love it. I have to feel all of you and all of you together, in me. I don't mind knowing that I'm making love with a woman, knowing that I've fucked a man, a woman whom I love more than any other person on the planet. I love it.</p> <p>I'm being treated like a whore, I'm loving it. I'm being treated like a whore by my man, by who I think my man might be. I feel you inside me, getting a little harder each time, your cock sliding in deeper. I love, then, you just a little bit faster, I'm pushing and deeper. Then, deeper your dick, I've got a little deeper, so now, I can feel that—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
