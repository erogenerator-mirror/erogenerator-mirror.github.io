Recalling his recent impressions, the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis; he</strong> had an appointment with the Emperor Francis himself when he was in England. The last time the Emperor Francis was present he had his daughter; in her stead the two had always slept together, it had led to much of the story and had a great deal to teach him. Francis knew his daughter would enjoy being a virgin again. He did not know her well, but he did expect if there was a chance then they would have sex. The day finally arrived. He prepared to leave for Europe. He told his parents he would be gone a few hours and left for Europe. His father and mother said goodbye and they bid him goodbye on a shopping spree, hoping he would return. He knew that they would love being with him even more than he was. Of course he knew what he could do in Europe and had to have what he needed now that he was a grown man now. They left his old house in Paris. He had no other plans for the day.</p> <p>He walked across to the train station and purchased his ticket. He grabbed his belongings and went to his room. He had only a light breakfast on the dinner table where he planned to fuck the woman of the day. He had to know whether she liked his body. The only thing in his mind was to fuck her. He had never felt so much love for another human being, it was enough to push him over the edge. The love he had for his cousin his cousin was strong and he knew that he would never let anyone hurt the man that he loved. He lay on the bed with his mind spinning. He still held in his rage on how she had become a virgin.</p> <p>When he went back to the room he changed his clothes, leaving out his white shirt. He had to have sex now. He had to be prepared and the sooner the better. He was nervous about walking down the street in his white shirt. He had hoped that she would be as beautiful as the woman he now wanted in the morning. It seemed that she had already had sex already for the first time that day in Paris when he had a chance. His cock was already hard when he walked across to her. He could see her face in the moonlight. Her eyes were wide and filled with fear. She was trying to run from him. She was afraid that he would do anything and in the mean time that she was scared that he wouldn't. That it scared her like nothing he knew.</p> <p>The fear was what made him want to just rape her and then fall asleep. He had to do it. He had to have sex with her. He remembered how she had begged him earlier so she knew what to expect. He remembered the fear as well and that feeling so much like rape as she would run around trying to escape him. It had been exciting as well as exhausting. He remembered the feeling of having sex with her. He felt the urge. He started to have sexual thoughts. How to fuck her. To fuck the woman of his dreams. He decided to just do it. He made his plans and left the room quietly.</p> <p>He walked slowly down the street before he saw his cousin Jeanine. He saw her face and she stared at one corner of the eye, waiting for him. He was surprised to see him there at that moment, he just assumed that she was going to come after him. How could he? It had always been a big secret that they had been lovers. What did she want? Did she really want to fuck him? Had she been thinking the same thing as he? How could it possibly take any of that time? She had to have a boyfriend. She had had sex with the same one a few times before. He saw her face. She was almost in tears. He looked at her face for some time. His heart sank. For some time he hoped that she would never come after him.</p> <p>"I'm coming." His heart dropped again and he walked as fast as possible so he wouldn't run until he reached her. He walked as fast as possible. She was scared. He could not have done it if he had wanted to. "Please don't come. May I come with you." He was asking. He couldn't possibly come. He took his coat off and put on a shirt and waited when her steps drew near. He hoped that she would not run towards him. "Please come" he said. But he could not say goodbye to her. He took a step. His heart had sunk even further when she stepped forward and shook his arm. He turned towards her and put his arm around her shoulders. "No" he said as he lifted her arms and put the coat to his shoulder. He hugged the girl so tightly that it was like it seemed impossible to be a feather he could do no longer just hold her. He breathed, just her. He could see her body. He put his hand on her arm. He could not for there anything more. His lips to her. He could put his lipsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
