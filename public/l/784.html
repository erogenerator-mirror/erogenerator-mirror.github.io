So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It</strong> was time to put it all into practice on Saturday, the best he could hope for. "Let's go for it," he said to himself.</p> <p>He picked up his textbook. But in the dim light, he could see where to concentrate, where he wanted the words to be.</p> <p>As he flipped through the pages of the last three entries in History, he couldn't help but think about the day that his mother told him that they'd be together on his birthday. With an almost audible gasp, he remembered her words, 'I'm going to love you'. His cock twitched, again and again, until it was throbbing with desire.</p> <p>In fact, even without his wife joining them, their sex life hadn't improved at all at all. The only positive thing that could have made things even better would have been a new friend, and then a chance to get to see them again. But all that changed in December. And in December, one of the few months that they didn't make wild passionate love, instead focused on some random idea that the two of them, both old and new, were going to go off together.</p> <p>The sex was good. It was fun. It was awesome. But it wasn't enough. The sex wasn't good enough. And even if they did decide to take that final step over the next few months, it was still something that they never would have done, and just wasn't allowed to do.</p> <p>For his own sanity, Tom started calling himself a "forever-boy" and "little slut," as in "this is just between the two of us." Then, he went on a diet of "this is no different than before the accident." After the breakup with Julia, he went out of town on a month long business trip. Now only one month after his girlfriend, Amy, died so he didn't have to worry about anyone seeing him.</p> <p>Tom's cock throbbed, again and again. It would be the only thing that his wife could ever have on the subject of sex. It would be her birthday. But it wasn't going to be the sex either. For the love of all that love, she hadn't even planned any of this for him in his own life. In one respect, she deserved to have that special birthday gift for both of them. But just one. To be with him would be the right thing to do, right up there with her birthday gift.</p> <p>The only way he could afford to go for it was to agree to it. But it would be a terrible leap to get an orgasm without knowing the actual outcome of it, and even then it wasn't something he'd want to actually do. As it was, he wasn't sure that it would be worth it.</p> <p>He didn't want to agree to anything at all, except that he wouldn't have those feelings for his wife. If she went out and bought herself a fancy house, and he ended up just going to her in the end, well, that would be an even worse mistake. In any case, Tom didn't have the courage to go for that little leap anyway.</p> <p>He had to do something about the problem he was experiencing with the idea that his girlfriend's birthday would be her birthday. He had to come up with a way that could actually work. After all, he'd been through a lot with just a few days of talking and making sure that no one at work saw him and even worse, what was going on in his life with his girlfriend's family wasn't going to be much of a problem for him, not even at that stage in his life.</p> <p>So he made his appointment with Amanda, a professional personal massage therapist, two hours away from his house and without his work, as suggested by the therapist. The session was not a sexual one...it was about getting the courage to do something about the problem he'd been having for the past four weeks.</p> <p>Amanda sat down in the chair as Tom walked in to the living room.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>It wasn't too long before Tom was able to get his mind around it. He wasn't sure that he could trust the person of his faith to only talk to him this far into history. But there was something about Amanda that he'd kept inside himself all this time. He'd kept it from him because it was for him. And even if it hurt him to even think about trying to tell her anything, she'd be able to figure something out.</p> <p>Tom wasn't the only one who did this. Some of the therapist's friends tried it. Some of his own were even. And in some of the girls, which he was in the process work themselves, even.</p> <p></p> <p>After having his experience of trying to have tried it, a few of trying, Tom, Tom made him feel it of trying, making him tryâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
