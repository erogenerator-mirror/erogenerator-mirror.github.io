The whole thing had been quite exhausting—a lot of erotica was involved in a bit more than the sex in my memoir, but the erotica was certainly a whole lot more enjoyable than the sex.</p> <p>But, you know what I mean, huh?</p> <p>Yeah, there's my sex and a bunch of sex and a bunch of sex.</p> <p>So many sex and a bunch of sex and a lot more sex then me.</p> <p>Okay, I could admit that this book really is really, really good. I still need to be more certain, if I am going to keep with what I've been doing, that I'm going to follow my lead on this thing—the sex.</p> <p>Right?</p> <p>I already fucked Mrs. Nichols and Mrs. Frankland—there was no sex or no sex of mine except maybe a threesome. So, what I need to do is go back again to the sex, right?</p> <p>There was a sex scene in the novel—a girl getting out a bath and getting into a tub—but I didn't see it.</p> <p>Okay, I got into the tub and was naked except for an apron—and when I turned around, Mrs. Nichols—a pretty woman—would be standing there with a tub of water on her left side looking at the action on the tub.</p> <p>The actress would be wearing a strap-on—a fake cock—on her right hip.</p> <p>The actress was getting ready to have a man's cum in her vagina.</p> <p>That was a lot sexier than that.</p> <p>Now, that's the sex I was looking into—a lot of sex and a bunch of sex.</p> <p>How many hundred people in the world should know about sex?</p> <p>As a sex student at a private university—how many hundred people do you think it takes to satisfy a hot girl?</p> <p>The sex scene in the book was the same as that scene in Mr. Williams' book—the guy ejaculating in a pretty, pretty girl.</p> <p>Just as you couldn't fuck a straight girl to save your life, you couldn't fuck a girl whose pussy was just wide enough to take it, could you?</p> <p>I knew something was missing, but couldn't see any way I could change the subject.</p> <p>Besides, I needed to stay focused on the sex or I'd end up in a difficult bind, so no one could be mad at me when I came out with this book.</p> <p>Just one more thing—what the hell was in my hands?</p> <p>Just one more thing—a big, long penis.</p> <p>To make it even more awkward than this book, I'd have to find a way to masturbate to this novel. And, a big thick one?</p> <p>Okay, I'll admit it was a big one. Big enough to be real, even the way it looked as it made me hard in my jeans at the bookstore.</p> <p>I thought about my dick, but I also thought about my testicles. They really, really looked great in that shirt.</p> <p>So, why did I choose that book—is it for older women?</p> <p>Why did I pick the sex scene in the book—that woman who was probably going to be on her knees on that tub of water with a hot, hard-on and not a bathtub attached to a tub of water?</p> <p>If you're just having a one-night stand, just let me know—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
