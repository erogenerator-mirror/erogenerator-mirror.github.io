When he awoke, it was dark except for the light of the campfire. The horses were gone. Little Bear guessed Grandfather had</strong> taken his wife, Rose, and bought her to raise some money for college. Little Bear had learned from a horse’s lesson that he had to make the best use of his horse’s life. Rose, still sleeping in the saddle, was sitting on Little Bear’s lap and riding him to his bedroom. Rose, clad in a robe, lay behind his back. She had an arm around his waist and was holding his cock by the base. The head of Little Bear’s cock was pressed against the fabric of the robe.</p> <p>Little Bear knew he needed to wake her up. He pulled the nightshirt over her head. She pulled the blanket over them and they lay on Little Bear’s bed. He kissed her cheek and neck as she rubbed her hand up and down his cock. She slowly moved her hand up and down the shaft, squeezing it with each pass. Little Bear was now hard as steel. Then he rolled over. He lifted Rose on top of him. The hot wetness of the nightshirt rubbing against his chest pushed him toward a climax. Little Bear was ready, but for this little fuck, he might actually win. Rose smiled as she pulled the nightshirt over her legs. Little Bear was still hard and needed to cum.</p> <p>They kissed. Little Bear kissed Rose, neck and chest. Rose rubbed Little Bear’s shaft with her soft hand. Little Bear pulled the nightshirt up again and kissed Rose. He kissed her shoulders and neck. His tongue gently circled her nipple and Rose moaned.</p> <p>Little Bear rolled Rose over and guided her down on her back. He rolled her nipples between his fingers. He sucked and bit Rose’s nipples. Little Bear’s body convulsed as he felt Rose’s body shake. Rose’s legs fell open to give Little Bear access to her warm pussy. Little Bear ran his fingers through Rose’s soft bush. He fingered her slowly and felt her pussy quiver.</p> <p>Rose pulled on Little Bear’s cock. He felt the first drops of his cum ooze out. Rose kissed the head of his cock and licked the remaining remains. Rose ran her tongue around Little Bear’s cock as it left her mouth.</p> <p>Rose opened her mouth wide and began sucking Little Bear. Little Bear fucked Rose’s mouth. Rose licked and sucked each of Little Bear’s balls. He thrust up against Rose’s tongue. He pulled Rose’s body until his cock was up and at her entrance. Little Bear lifted and slid Rose’s body onto his. They began to ride in the slow motion of lovemaking. Rose’s clit became visible between his balls. She started to moan. Little Bear’s orgasm started from a place deep inside of him. He could feel Rose’s pussy contract against his cock. He was cumming in Rose’s mouth. She licked his cock and pushed her clit against him. Her body locked up as Little Bear’s cum shot into her pussy.</p> <p>Rose was exhausted, but not nearly satisfied by a fucking she had just received. As she lay under Little Bear in the soft light, he kissed her face, neck and breasts. Little Bear pulled off his dress shirt. It was his last piece of clothing. He knelt on the bed and placed it beside her, then lay on his back and kissed her lips until he was hard again.</p> <p>Rose felt the warm moist lips of Little Bear against her pussy. Little Bear's lips surrounded her pussy and his tongue stroked up and down her length, teasing her clit. Little Bear’s thumb played with her nipple. She was going to cum, but knew she was not allowed the right to cum yet. Little Bear stopped. He smiled. He moved slowly and softly up her belly until his mouth found Rose’s pussy. His lips touched hers and he pulled his tongue into his mouth. Their breathing was slow. Rose gasped as he sucked her clit.</p> <p>Rose pushed Big Bear’s head back down on her bed. Little Bear pushed Rose’s legs apart, and began to kiss her thighs. His kisses became closer and closer to her pussy. Rose’s breathing intensified. She wanted to cum. Little Bear ran his tongue up and down her pussy lips. He sucked her clit and held it inside of his mouth. Rose could not help it. Her body tensed. She felt Little Bear’s tongue slip in her pussy. His lips pressed against her clit. Her body moved up to heaven.</p> <p>Little Bear kissed Rose’s face. His head. He caressed her face and let his cock. And smiled. Rose be with both of their mouths.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>A He kissed her he kissed, his lips A A she felt—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
