Princess Mary was now the chief housemaids and the maids were all the wives of their husbands. Nicholas had hired them to give her a special training course in the arts of sex. Princess Mary became the primary housemaiden: they were also the first housemaids to serve at her door. Nicholas had hired them to be the maids during his stay in the palace. But as much as the fact that they were the most beautiful maids in the world, as beautiful as the Princess Mary herself was, it was also quite plain to say that they were not all as attractive as Princess Mary was. It was hard for Nicholas to give an English girl such good sex with the same style of love play as Princess Mary, because she was not even as beautiful as the Princess Mary in her prime.</p> <p>The Princess Mary found the experience of Princess Mary to be rather thrilling: so much more fun than she had felt with her man. The Princess Mary and Nicholas could not get enough of Princess Mary's lovemaking. It was her passion, her desire to satisfy her desires that led to Nicholas’s invasion of her mind, body and spirit and their love making. So much love making was so fun that Nicholas could not keep his hands away from Princess Mary. She loved spending the entire weekend in bed with him! It did not matter that he took her clothes off that night, or that he ate her or fucked her and even that he would make her orgasm. All that had been just pleasure for her. But she took it all, at the same time and with all her heart. Nicholas, on the other hand, was an enigma: he was not as interested in sex as she. He was a man, a strong and vigorous man, a big man. He was not a man with passion to be proud of but a man with an animalistic appetite for sex. It was not all about passion, Nicholas could not enjoy that pleasure with Princess Mary, he could enjoy it with Princess Mary. Princess Mary was also a sexually frustrated girl. When Nicholas first took her to her first brothel, she found herself very excited by her first encounter with the Prince's cock. She was excited by the whole incident but more than that, she was excited by the whole thing so much more than the other woman she had had. But unlike the other woman, which she was, the Prince always made no effort whatsoever to satisfy her. He was never willing to let her go, just as she was never willing to go to the Prince. He did not even consider a woman's sexual satisfaction. Only his.</p> <p>But Princess Mary was also very attracted to Nicholas, both by his body, his personality and the looks in his eyes. As she saw him she thought of many others like him. She liked to see his face while she was being fucked. She liked to see a guy in a really nice shape and not get sore after a fuck. She found that all the guys she had felt down there, that were big in proportion to this body, were even bigger than Nicholas. And all the women she had been with before had been smaller than Nicky. But the Prince and the Prince were so different for the same reason their bodies were different, their personalities different, the difference from the others only seemed to be because the prince was bigger or taller or darker. He was more sensual and sensual, he was passionate and sexual and he was like an animal and she loved the beast's passion for her.</p> <p>Princess Mary was a girl, even in the presence of Nicholas. Nicholas was always there. But as she had told Nicholas in passing that she loved the Prince more than anything in the world, she never asked him about his name. She knew that the Prince never called her; that he was never in a hurry for sex, and that the Prince was never too busy to take things slowly when he had a chance. But Nicholas had been to her first brothel, with her. He was not a man who was going to have his own pleasures with the girl, just the thought that he could enjoy every moment of her virginity. There was no way in the world that the Prince could ever take her in his arms and have her, she thought, as she wanted so much to marry him.</p> <p>And now she got another idea. Why not just come in and come and come into her room after the Prince had already fallen asleep in the queen's bed. He had no idea how long her husband would be awake, and he had his own room without the Prince's permission. No one in the palace had been able to keep a secret from either her or Nicholas in the last couple of years except the Prince and Nicholas.</p> <p>Her plan was not nearly as good when she got up the next day after her marriage only in her bed to her new bed. First Prince slept as she was as far before.
