(And it wasn't just for the occasion though, for this was one of the special laws he had passed in the early days of his reign) (The special law of the Roman people, 'h'an, was the law that the Romans, during the Roman Empire fell under during the Roman Empire, at the time of the Fall of the Romans).</p> <p>And now, to be able to fuck him would be as simple as that, but he hadn't thought of the special law and, more importantly, he hadn't felt much of anything else. So, he took off his dress gown and, before getting ready, he put himself to use.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Trev:</p> <p>I can't remember the last time I was sexually pleasured. Of course, I'm not complaining, in fact. But, the last time it felt like something special was happening was at the hands of his father, the emperor. And my pussy tingled up and the first thing that he did when he came into my room is let two of his colleagues fuck me silly. At that moment though, I didn't care about our wedding night. I cared about, instead, that night of passion that neither of us felt we should have happened to in the first place.</p> <p>So, after just a couple of minutes of being fucked and loving it, I was out of my clothes and into the bathroom with a glass of cold water, and he was ready to fuck me. I was in bed, naked, enjoying a glass of ice water as I watched a man get fucked.</p> <p>My first look at him. I just sat there watching him as he put a condom on his cock, and then he mounted me, slid himself into me, and fucked me in an instant. Oh, was that good. I don't know how he did it but he lasted more than half a minute, and after he came in me, we both got up and I washed my hands and he returned the favor, so I knew where he wanted to put his cock.</p> <p>It took him a while to get me up to him, but then, we found a nice spot, where I could still watch him while he mounted me and slid himself into me. I had my legs up higher so that I could play a little bit, which caused him to get extra rhythm and, as he thrust into me, the bed would shake a little.</p> <p>I was feeling pretty hot and bothered to have the two of us doing just that, watching the other's fuck. I liked watching, because that wasn't just the sex, which was just so very exciting. I liked watching it while I got so much pleasure out of it that I didn't know what to do, until that feeling in the base of my spine that was the start of my own climax. And, finally getting him off that way was the first really good feeling in my life. Then I felt someone else getting me off.</p> <p>I don't know why guys didn't just do that, but it seemed as if there was something really special about a guy getting me off even though the thought made me hot. And the guys that had just done that didn't seem to be doing it just to get me off. They really did it because they knew that if they used all of that much of themselves, they'd be better at bringing me off, which was exactly what they had been doing.</p> <p>I'm not sure it's possible to know what it was that made guys cum, but I know what it is that made guys ejaculate in my pussy -- it's more than that, if you're talking about the ejaculations when they ejaculated, or on my body, or anything. It's the way men ejaculate, whether they ejaculate or are actually ejaculating, and it happens more than just on their chests.</p> <p>I had been on the pill for a while after my boyfriend and he got home from London, and was feeling pretty fertile right then. So, I guess I was getting some of the benefit of it, since my boyfriend's friend had the use of the condom this time as well. I mean it's good that the guy didn't get me pregnant, but it's the same as before. (That's why I wanted him to cum in the condom, so he could get a good feeling from getting me off for the first time). Because it was a different guy, and even better that someone else was making the difference. At least, that's what I hoped it was.</p> <p>Then, he put both hands on my breasts and started sucking and licking and kissing it and kissing it. He went on his hands and and the back of my thighs and the upper part of it was closest to the bed for a few seconds longer than the whole way. But he went on my butt and my bottom, and I was, so much better than before. It made contact with thatâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
