John had a penis and, as anyone can tell by my experience, he has a cock. And I think that he, too, would have liked his cock to be erect. John had never been a believer in the Bible, and I believe that, while some might understand him as a pious churchman, he didn't really believe in the Holy Bible—even as we came to know it very well.</p> <p>John's family was always very nice, and John had never seen many of his family members as they might see him. Well, he'd been around. He came and went from his house whenever possible. I had known him for almost seven years. We were in the Army, in the Marines, at base, in various places, and we were very close. Whenever I would see him, he'd always smile at me—like we could share those smiles with one another. Well, we had been on the same squad in high school, and at school he would stare at me as he passed past, and I noticed it as he passed past. He could almost see my lips curl into a knowing smile as he passed past. John was very bright and intelligent, and he would smile at me all the time. I could see his eyes, and when I looked at them, I could see the sparkle in his eyes, the light in his eyes…and his mouth…and my heart began to beat a little faster. But, though he had been a military man, he had always been an active student—and his mind as well as his body had always played games with me on several occasions. That had been a very important part of his childhood. In fact, the only time I saw him as he had been in uniform was when he was in uniform on several days a week.</p> <p>John was born in 1942, but came to America just as he was returning to school after his service to the World War Two. It was just like most of my family he was so focused on his school work. So, while he was in school he would read and write and study. He would go to the library several times a week, and do homework—and at times he would do many of those kinds of things himself. But, as I have said a few moments ago, I was a good student, and often he would catch me admiring the "Mistletoe" which had been placed there so he could watch for me—sometimes he would even sneak a look at my crotch! If he was on my way to a meeting, or was just watching TV, I would make sure he was looking at me and the cleft in the crotch of my panties in hopes of winning a quick "thank you". I couldn't help sneaking that look at his bulge every day! I wanted him to catch me looking at any part of him, and he had succeeded on more than one occasion...</p> <p>We would always be in the vicinity of my parents' house. I had taken care of our family's needs for most of my high school years, but that was to be expected. We lived close to each other. John and I always went to my parents' house on the weekends, and we had always managed to keep our parents company. Our parents knew that most of our lives were in the house, not in John's. But, they respected our privacy, and never judged us, and we were never the more aware of it. John's parents never caught him stealing a look at me, and so I'm sure they didn't mind. But John's parents were also very strict. They disapproved of John and his sexual activities, and it was the policy that they never let us see them without our permission.</p> <p>But, they also made clear to us of their disapproval for John. The most important aspect of sexual procreation was how many times you pleasured the "Mistletoe," even without our knowledge. They said that I shouldn't experience sexual intercourse without their knowledge, and that would be against the church of Jesus. Their disapproval was because, since I came to school in fact, that we didn't even know each other religions that we were supposed to be different from "The Secret and had sex partners.
