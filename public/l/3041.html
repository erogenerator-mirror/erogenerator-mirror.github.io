That wee have of Geometry, which is the</strong> foundation for the Human condition? I say that I wish to ask you some questions. But please let me ask you some questions. These are the first few.</p> <p>This is meant for those looking to get an eye full of sex. If all that is required is the word "check" then no need. If all that is needed is a word, you should get a fuck.</p> <p>Let's say you're reading these questions to see if you're reading the same thing, then the question should be easy and it's the sex talk you would like to read. And if you would rather you didn't take the question but just read a sentence, then you'd be good too. If you've read, let me give you a hand.</p> <p>- - - -</p> <p>If everything is clear... I think some of you might be wondering why I wrote this story. I'm kidding. But if you'd like me to do a little bit of creative editing here and there then... I could.</p> <p>Sorry for the wait.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>- - - - - -</p> <p>Chapter 6 - Introduction</p> <p>"I was thinking about our first encounter," Sarah began, "and maybe we could do something a little different with our next session together. You're the one who recommended it, aren't you Mr. Evans?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I am, uh, I'm sorry, but are you sure you want me to read this? It's a first time for you, aren't you? I didn't know if you were up to doing so."</p> <p>"No, absolutely not," she said. "I don't have a history of doing that stuff myself, and in any event, you can probably imagine that being our first time being just that... We wouldn't have sex, would we? It was kind of a first time experience for me."</p> <p>"So you're not saying 'I did it anyway'? Or, maybe you're thinking of something else?"</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know. It wasn't like being a guy with sex hormones. It was more like, as I said, an exploration of your femininity by a nice and decent guy like you... that sort of thing... and I really enjoyed it." She paused a little after that, as if searching for the right words. "No, I'm not sure I want to think of it as having sex with you. Just, well, that's not it. This would be something we would not do again. We're just exploring what is in that moment of our lives."</p> <p>"What does that mean?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure, but maybe we would be doing things differently than what is usually associated with what we are doing now. Maybe it would be much more pleasurable if we had a nice, normal conversation about it."</p> <p>"What sort of conversation?" I had a feeling I know the answer.</p> <p>"I'm not sure why, but you might have to make some kind of statement here at work and I won't care, but I really don't care what that's all about."</p> <p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p> <p>"I'm telling you I had a guy in my office when I was in high school, with me and just kind of... doing stuff. You could say, I guess, a little, well sort of, like, when our desks were touching. But then it happened. Then all of a sudden I started thinking about what it would be like to have those guys looking at me like a whore or something, if I were a guy. I mean, I wasn't thinking... you know, sexually so it was just kind of fun to have that sort of thing happening for once, and in the car, and then, so it was just fun to be a guy at the same time. I knew I was doing that for my own benefit, and I liked it even more for the sex of it, if that's possible."</p> <p>"You said we were exploring different things?"</p> <p>"I think so. Just thinking about it, I think it might have something to do with how we would go about it. Just me and Mr. Evans?"</p> <p>"I don't see where that is happening. We're just experimenting a little here. We're just exploring what is in this moment, and if we were to be a little more intimate with each other, if we would be getting a little more... uh... personal with each other now."</p> <p>"Oh, good!" Sarah replied with a smile. "So, are you suggesting that this is a good first time for us? Do you want to take things a little further?"</p> <p>"What do we do is fine. We're going to have the best, I think. Is that right? What's about it too far? I don't care? Can't mind?"</p> <p>"Sure, yeah, I guess weâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
