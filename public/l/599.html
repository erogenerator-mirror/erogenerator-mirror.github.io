After the</strong> first French dance, which lasted well after noon, for the first time, there were no problems. There were plenty of beautiful girls, not to mention the male student body was interested in fucking them.</p> <p>"You've made a beautiful group."</p> <p>"I'd like to fuck you Pierre, but I'm afraid I have no experience with it. I'm afraid I'm too young and inexperienced," said a brunette.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid of anything. I'm not your father, I'm not going to go out to dinner with you. You can tell each other what to do if you want to and then you should."</p> <p>"I'll call you tomorrow. And now that I've fucked you, I'm going to want to fuck you."</p> <p>***</p> <p>When Jeanine saw Pierre's car parked in front of the restaurant, she went out and ran up to the back entrance. She rang the bell and waited. There was no one around. She went inside and saw an old couple waiting for their drinks. She went over to him and asked him what he wanted.</p> <p>"Can I order for you, sir," he said with a laugh.</p> <p>With the glass of wine he gave her, she went to the counter. When she came back with his order, she knew what it must be. He gave her a bottle of his best and put a credit card in her hand; he told her she could use the same credit card as his.</p> <p>In just under one hour, she had his cock all hard and dripping.</p> <p>They got off the elevator and as soon as the bell rang, they were on a mission to fuck the other.</p> <p>She took his cock into her mouth and proceeded to suck it into her throat. She held back so that she could feel the pleasure of being fucked while he was getting sucked off.</p> <p>With a moan, Pierre let her continue sucking on his cock until he moaned that it was time to cum. He pulled his cock out of her mouth, took her head in his hands and pushed it down until his cock shot his cum into her mouth. She kept sucking until he was done shooting his load and then took his cock with her hand, cleaned it off with her mouth and swallowed the rest while they looked at each other.</p> <p>As soon as the kiss ended, she told him to take her and take her home.</p> <p>On the drive home, the next day, she was thinking of Pierre. It was hard to concentrate on dinner because she remembered the first time she had sex with Pierre, and she had enjoyed herself quite thoroughly that evening. Thinking of Pierre made her feel horny again, especially the way he had taken her virginity. She remembered the first French kiss. The thought of having Pierre's mouth sucking on her breasts made her hot. She also remembered the second French kiss, and how it excited her so much.</p> <p>After dinner, she went out and got some fresh underwear to wear to the party. She decided to wear her new underwear as she had a skirt and blouse in her drawer and the new bra and panties. She put on her panty hose and the bra because the skirt felt so soft and smooth when she put it on. She took her panties and put them on. Since the skirt fit well, she put on the stockings just above her calves.</p> <p>The party in Hugo had already started at three-thirty. She felt very much into the party and she had invited a number of male friends to help her make her choice of music. The number of male friends was in that order because Jeanine was a very smart, funny gal.</p> <p>As it got closer to closing, Pierre made her stop at a bar to dance with the bartender. But when she brought a bottle of wine with her, she found it hard to resist the urge to go out and buy the wine.</p> <p>At first, she stayed in one place, but later she did find a lot of male friends. She knew one of them was some student, but she didn't take him home with her. She had no reason to go home with him.</p> <p>She walked to the bar and asked the bartender for wine. When the bartender looked her over, one of his friends asked her if she wanted her to do the same for him.</p> <p>She told him not to pester her like that. She made a small gesture of asking them for the wine. She also made certain the drinks she was carrying were white.</p> <p>Pierre's eyes lit up when the waiter brought the wine. In a matter of minutes, the waiter said,</p> <p>"Do you think you need anything after the three-part party?"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She did not answer him</p> <p>"No</p> <p>She didn't hear</p> <p>(no (?)</p> <p>(?)
