A man who is as black as midnight. His skin, hair, and eyes. So fucking black. And so fucking masculine. But his eyes? They're hazel but they're too blue to be black. And their color really is so black, but I don't say white.</p> <p>My name's Scott and on this date, I wore my usual outfit, this dressy, black dress that, although slightly too tight it was comfortable to wear so, I could wear it underneath when there were people around. That was when I took a dip while in the pool. It was then that I noticed that not only was there a white guy there, but there was another man there too. He was wearing a black bikini that covered his body and left his crotch exposed. He had a dick, as I knew. I wondered if he would even be wearing a white one.</p> <p>I was so caught off-guard by that moment that I didn't even notice that I was wearing black, bikini, and swim trunks underneath that I went on without taking them off. It was then when I saw the contrast between white and black. I knew that if I had to do something like take my top off, then it would be better. I took my bikini off.</p> <p>For this, the only way I will be walking around with a black bikini that matches this dress, is if I put on the suit that is in it. No one is out but the men who sit down around the table can see everything. So I put on the suit. Because it's too short to fit comfortably underneath that yellow one. I put on black one too.</p> <p>Then I noticed. I saw my reflection in the mirror of the door of the house I was in. It was as though someone knocked on my door. I felt my heart leap from my chest to my chin. I felt even more vulnerable, more insecure.</p> <p>I felt the presence of the stranger who just walked in to the room before me. He stood outside, in a black dress and black shoes and nothing else. I looked into his face and saw a look of surprise mixed with pleasure and delight, and there's a smile behind his eyes that made my stomach drop all the way to my chin and then there was a big bulge in his trousers under a robe of fabric that left nothing to the imagination. He wore a white button down shirt that was tied loosely at his waist. I don't know of if it's because the shirt is white, but I bet it had to be. My breath got short. This stranger had a penis that I couldn't see because it was hidden. But when he turned, I saw his cock that I would die to touch.</p> <p>"Hey, Scott! What's the occasion?" He was in his forties while his friend was older than me, a couple decades older, and he looked like a college senior, rather older than him. But I noticed that he had black hair, black eyes, big muscles, and not so big a face. He was handsome enough to do a dance with. His chest was muscular under the robe, like a black biker.</p> <p>I stared at him and said, "Well, that you're...a swimmer."</p> <p>He smiled and said, "No, I'm a student of course. I'm a swimmer."</p> <p>I took in the distance. I kept looking at this face that was so familiar to me, so familiar I could feel it in my body. He was handsome with his long, blonde, wavy hair and dark eyes. And his penis was that familiar, hard, circumcised shape. He looked really good, and his penis looked very, very, masculine. For the first time in my life I looked at a penis in front of me.</p> <p>It was time to get rid of my sunglasses while we continued our walk from the pool to the table. I took them off, because it would be too painful to wear them. When we got to the table and sat down, there's no one else around. Even though everybody is looking at me, most of the table is hidden behind a table cloth. The table cloth isn't transparent and I can look at what people see. So I put my sunglasses on the edge of the table and sat down.</p> <p>"So, what did you think," I asked and then I asked a question.</p> <p>"Well, you have your hair done but you look like a swimmer," replied Scott. "I didn't know you knew when I saw you in the pool."</p> <p>"But don't worry, I didn't know anything."</p> <p>I said, putting my sunglasses on the table.</p> <p>I took a sip and then I was standing at his table. I noticed that it wasn't put on the table. His eyes I was on the chair again. Our table. "What else?
