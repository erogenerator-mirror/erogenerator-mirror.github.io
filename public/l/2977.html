Faith was to be placed between the Father of the Church and the Virgin.</p> <p>"We can all know by now what the real meaning of the Church is. It is not just religion but the real, true meaning of it."</p> <p>"And how can it not be the real meaning, since it is so much bigger and better to help the Church than it is to us, to help the people we seek, and what we seek." - Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p> <p>Faith and I, as one, decided to go up into the bedroom. She put on the negligee that I had bought her and she lay down in the large bed, as I took my clothes off, except for my jockey shorts, which she had picked up. She slid her thong down her legs, and then, sitting up, taking my prick in her mouth, she sucked it into the warm, wetness that was the crease between her anus and vagina. I lay down next to her, feeling warm and cozy as the aroma of her vagina assaulted my senses. I felt safe and protected; it was just the way I felt each time I fucked her. We moved to the center of the bed, her on top of me, her weight shifting her body weight on me. I reached behind her to feel her boobs through her negligee.</p> <p>Faith raised up and turned onto her knees and she reached back to help me out of my pants, which slid to the carpeted floor as we got undressed. Before lowering herself down on my waiting cock, she pulled off her negligee and, kneeling beside me, she wrapped her arms and legs around me, holding me close, with her boobs pressed against my chest. I could feel her vagina moving and the warm wetness of her vagina wrapped around me. I could actually feel her wet vaginal opening sliding along my shaft, as she rubbed her clitoris on my leg.</p> <p>"Oh, Bobby, I want you, I need you, and I want to have you now," she said, as she raised and lowered her hips up and down. I felt her cervix on my shaft, as she pushed and slid her labia down on it. My cock filled up her vagina and was fully in, as she lay on top of me, with her chest on mine. She rocked her hips up and down, as we came together and finally gave into what we both wanted, what we had been doing; what we needed.</p> <p>"We are each like a pair, together and apart, my love," I replied with my arms around her.</p> <p>"And I love you too, my love."</p> <p>After we had sex again, I carried her into the bedroom and laid her on the bed, as I lay next to her, with my arm around her. I said, "I want to do everything for you, but I also really love what you look like in that negligee and I really want you to love me."</p> <p>"Well, Bobby, if you look like a woman, and you're wearing that negligee at least one of our family members, we'll be happy to try everything for you. You have to tell me where she comes from. She is going to be the one that will love you. Can you tell her that?"</p> <p>"Well, I guess so, I don't really know how you would react, since that is the only way to describe the moment."</p> <p>"Bobby, I love you. I just haven't had a date in a long time. Even though we did that one night, it was great sex, and I was never going to regret having done what ever happened. I love you, my love."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I replied. I turned her on her side so I could get my back to her. I wanted to go over to her, lay next to her, and hold her. Just as my arm was about to fall off, I felt the hand that was gripping my arm move.</p> <p>"Bobby," she said to me. "You're too beautiful for me. Don't you know I love you, even though I didn't date you? Do you know how lucky I am, because of my age. I didn't want it to end, especially because of our relationship. When you are over to sleep with her again tomorrow, I want to see you get more than just the two of us together."</p> <p>"Okay, Faith, I will have everything I want. I love you so much, and I don't want to get a second hand in your relationship anything, either," I guess," I responded. We fell asleep in each other on the same bed that night, one another night.</p> <p>Hope was a while we were still inâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
