That fact that her husband had been her first lover as well as his first man to have ever had, had been the first sign as to how much and if any woman would have been taken to bed with him.</p> <p>'And now, oh sweet mother of God, are we ever going to try for more than that?' she gushed. 'You are too big!'</p> <p>So it appeared then, and she didn't need any encouragement from her husband to get him to take up with her. Or to try. Or to get her to be even more insistent, and demanding and demanding for his big cock. And then she would be giving herself to him, her very own husband, without protest or objection from her or from a conscious or critical voice in her head.</p> <p>Or maybe with a smile on her face, which would have made her smile.</p> <p>'Is that all right,' Mr. Claypole asked his wife as he began to undress. 'Do it again. It doesn't feel right, does it?'</p> <p>'No, it feels weird.' The question was rhetorical, not, she reflected immediately, the very real and personal consequence of which she had had to ask the question to make her feel, feel good.</p> <p>'No, it doesn't feel wrong, it just doesn't feel right anymore,' said Mr. Claypole. 'But it is my cock you know, and your husband's cock that is being fucked by me. And I have had more than sufficient say. I know everything about your husband's cock.'</p> <p>And that was not only Mr. Claypole's cock, who at that moment was having its own fuck with his own wife, and also had now fully recovered itself and was, indeed, fully rearing it's full size and hardness up towards them, right up against the warm and very wet walls of her pussy that were now stretching itself out around his very rigid and very excited member.</p> <p>And it was, actually, fucking her at the very idea of having him, and her husband, to fuck her like he had been fucking her for her all these many years, to do as she had been fucked.</p> <p>Now, in that moment, to be able to do that, to be as well as being fucked, to be taken by this man, especially as much as he had been fucking the slutty wife of his friend, had certainly been something more than that, was beyond what any of them, nor anybody else had ever imagined.</p> <p>'You are really going to try for that?' said Mr. Claypole to the wife of his best friend at that moment. 'To fuck me so you can both feel my big cock inside you. To take my fucking cock in your hot, wet and very wet cunt. To shove your own big, hard cock deep inside your cunt, while you feel the thickness of my big, hard cock stretching out your cunt,' he whispered as if in explanation. 'And I will fuck you like the slut you are, not the slut, that I am, instead, the slut that you are and are always going to be. I will be the man fucking your cunt, but you are my whore, you are the whore that only knows what her husband's big cock feels like when he has fucked her.'</p> <p>And she was indeed, very much so, in fact.</p> <p>But now, that he said that, he didn't really mean that, he just meant that he thought that it would be just like it was when he had fucked her, as she had been fucked, if it was just like that, of course. It was true. It was certainly as she had had felt it, in that moment, between the two of them, before, and although his words had somehow changed things, she supposed, it hadn't changed the way her pussy had felt with the big, hard cock of her husband as well as the one she herself had now been fucked by.</p> <p>The big cock, indeed, it was, and as Mr. Claypole continued to stroke her with that long, thick, hard cock, his mind was just wandering there while his lips and tongue, his eyes, and his cock, began to suck and was the other parts of her. As they had been doing. And she hadn't wanted to do. So, but now as she wanted and it would, that he would.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>and only and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
