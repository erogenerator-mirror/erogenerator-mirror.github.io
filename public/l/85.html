Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXIV The Counsel of Philo</h4><p><strong>Roaring like a whirlwind, shouting triumphantly, once more the wheel of fire rolled on its tremendous course. I watched it come, I watched it go, while in it I thought</strong> of your amazing mouth on my cock. It was so hard, so wonderful when I shot my sperm, as I held my cock deep in your mouth, while you kept licking my balls dry, sending me deeper into orgasm-buzz. It was unbelievable what you saw; you were a natural born cock sucker; I was your guinea pig. Your tongue was like an invisible instrument. What a feeling, feeling, how wonderful.</p> <p>I watched as the sun went down a little, my balls and cock softening. I rested my cock in the crack of your rear, gently, stroking your ass, my fingers softly caressing your clitoris. The whole body came back to life as we were once again embraced by the sun. We slowly fell backward into each other, my soft cock still inside your ass. Our lips met, we kissed, we rocked. It was wonderful. You knew what was happening, as I felt your hands stroking my body, stroking me. You felt good.</p> <p>You turned around, leaning back against my chest. Your fingers trailed up the inside of my legs to my thighs, massaging me, teasing my skin. I could tell you sensed what I wanted. You lifted my chin, looking into my eyes. You smiled, and then with a gentle push, I rolled onto my back. I could feel my cock sliding from your warmth. Your head lowered and you kissed me. I felt you open your mouth and begin sucking my nipples, nibbling on them, pulling at them. They were erect, and I grabbed them with my lips, softly moaning in response. I felt a small orgasm building and then I came, pumping into her. You stayed on top of me, and continued pleasuring me as I came.</p> <p>You rolled over to lie on your tummy. I lifted my hips and my soft cock fell from your ass. I smiled at you. My smile was sweet, yet hungry. My head dropped onto your naked back. I reached both hands down to your breasts, rolling your nipple between my fingers. I kneaded them, lifting them, squeezing gently, flicking the soft eraser until it began to stand against your skin. I was in your body. You had come on the sea, on your first real sea voyage. My cock twitched. I wanted more. I lifted my head and licked and suckled the right nipple with my lips.</p> <p>"Oh yes. That's right," you moaned. I slid over a little further, lifting your bottom, spreading your leg so I could straddle the small of your back. I lifted the other side so I could take it in my mouth. I could see how the water below had taken on an almost permanent shine, you could barely see. The sunlight streamed down on us from the tall trees over the horizon.</p> <p>I knelt on the bank, raising my head, as I guided my cock into you. You wrapped your arms around my waist and looked up at me, looking down at my hard cock pumping inside you. With my back to the trees, your long fingers trailed behind my head, tickling my hair. I thrust up and down, up and down. Your hips started thrusting, wanting in, wanting deep.</p> <p>I could hold it for a little longer. Then I thrust as hard as I could and you came, squeezing me with your body. I felt every little convulsion of your orgasm, as we both felt it. You lay back as the sun faded, resting your back against the tree trunk. My cock remained hard inside you as you lay there panting. I pulled your bottom a little away from me and moved back down your body, moving my weight so I could kneel between your legs. I kissed, licked and nibbled you all over, until I realized that you were ready for more, wanting more. I raised myself onto my knees while you still lay back. I moved up until my cock was level with your face. You started to lick me, like a hungry kitten, slowly and hungrily. We kissed, like a hungry mother giving a baby. You reached back to stroke my ass as I slid inside you.</p> <p>I couldn't get enough of you. I didn't have to get close. I began thrusting, as slowly and gently as I could. We had to have it, it was inevitable. We were coming together, and that was all it was going to be. I could feel your heart beating in rapid-fire rhythms, as my skin slid inside your pussy over and over, in and out again and again. I could feel your legs tighten around me as you cried out in ecstatic joy. You could feel my body shaking as you came, as I continued thrust into you. In the way our bodies met.</p> <p></p> <p>I was lying on my side, back on mine back and we were kissing and he thigh.
