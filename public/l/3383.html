G. Wells </h3><h4>HOW I REACHED HOME.</h4><p><strong>For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about me gathered the invisible terrors of</strong> the past and brought me to a restful state of euphoria. No sooner had I closed my bag than I felt a sharp tongue licking across my face, a soft whisper in my ear, and the feel of a finger on my clit.</p> <p>At first I was too busy savoring the bliss of a kiss. I opened my eyes and looked for the source of the sensation that I expected: the sight of a girl on her knees at my feet, sucking eagerly on my cock, her hands massaging my balls, and me thrusting into her hot mouth over and over. But her eyes seemed to have grown accustomed to my eyes and the girl at my feet smiled as her hands were busy squeezing my balls and fingering my ass. It was more than I could stand and my balls tightened. I came and came and came and came, and this girl kept sucking at me, drinking it up. And, finally, the last drop seeped from my cock and she stood up, my cock deflating in her mouth. That night for me, the nights I never got to fuck anyone for the privilege, I learned everything about my past.</p> <p>But it was an hour before I had a chance to catch up to where I should have been heading. As my pants fell to the floor, I was struck by the beauty of the naked and glistening girl on the couch, naked as she stood. She kept her hair in a ponytail as my eyes drank in her. She was so perfect. And her skin was so silky and soft, so white and pristine, so flawless, so perfectly made, so lovely and perfect. And the sex between us was incredible.</p> <p>As I stepped away from her, she rose, leaving my cock pointing proudly as I headed to her. Her smile remained at its deepest, and we stood, embracing again, still connected, but apart. She pulled my head down and kissed me. For a moment, we just stared at each other until her hand slid down and took hold of my still-erect cock. She guided me to the bedroom and pushed me onto the soft bed and took me in her mouth. For a minute, she went on for me like that, taking me into her throat until, at last, I was fully sheathed within her warm and willing orifice. Her tongue found my balls, and she licked the underside of them, paying special attention to their tender flesh. I knew that I was not going to last much longer when she suddenly withdrew.</p> <p>"Don't cum!" she hissed as she pushed me back on the bed and straddled me. And she lowered herself onto me.</p> <p>I felt her hot, juicy cunt engulf me, enveloping me as her eyes locked on mine.</p> <p>"That's it," she said. "You're bigger than me. You're so beautiful! You're my big boy!" She rose up and lowered her face against mine, our lips meeting.</p> <p>Our kiss was magical, our passion as raw and primitive as that. I felt the tip of my cock press into her and her clit rub against me. I thrust into her, filling her and stretching her, filling her, filling her all without end. My orgasm burst within me and her own orgasm hit at the same moment. I felt everything as if I was cumming again.</p> <p>The next morning, as I woke, the next morning I was aware of a world spinning and I was aware of nothing. I could have been asleep in my apartment. I felt her as I sleptâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
