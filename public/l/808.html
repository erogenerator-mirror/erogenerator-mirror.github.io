They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the cave—wonders</strong> they had once shared.</p> <p>And then Becky and Tom began. The two of them were going over their morning’s activities and trying to decide what felt the best. Becky decided on a 69 from the first. The two of them were sucking each other’s pussies, tongues licking and stroking others. The two lay back and shared their pleasure.</p> <p>It was the most wonderful love-making of all. Every second of it was a memory. It was so perfect that it was almost difficult to think of love. There was nothing to think about; nothing to feel.</p> <p>Tom got up and started to change his clothes. Becky and Tom were still on the blanket. They looked at each other and smiled for a moment. Becky had a wicked feeling in her stomach that night as she began to rub her pussy, thinking of an answer.</p> <p>“Fuck, Becky! I’m getting off!”</p> <p>“Don’t come yet! I mean right on the blanket. We’ll wait.”</p> <p>Tom was still in the moonlight, so he looked around. The only other thing on the blanket was his boxers, which revealed a thick white cock. He was naked and ready. He lay down next to Becky and moved her on top of him.</p> <p>“If I do something in back, your going to get something to eat!”</p> <p>“Well, sure, if you’re sure, I‘ll have to wait just a little while.”</p> <p>Becky started to climb up Tom’s body. He had never seen anything like it, let alone a dick this size. It was a joy to feel it between her legs. It was so erotic that Tom was having a difficult time concentrating on what a woman was doing to him. He moved Becky so that her pussy was directly above his dick and pressed it up against it with some of the pleasure coming from his wife.</p> <p>“How long are you going to wait?” Becky asked as she tried to find a rhythm.</p> <p>“I don’t know. I just …uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!”</p> <p>Tom tried hard to keep the pleasure going, but it was so difficult. Becky was doing it again and again.</p> <p>“How do you want me?”</p> <p>“I want you inside me! I want you to fuck me!”</p> <p>Tom’s penis was straining for relief and Becky’s pussy was still dripping from one long orgasm. Tom lay on Becky, holding her close and trying not to come too soon.</p> <p>“Tom, we’re here!”</p> <p>Becky moved off him, her pussy still aching and hot. Tom took his dick and rubbed it against Becky’s lips. He was ready to come. He didn’t want to get the thought out of his head.</p> <p>“Come on! Don’t hold back! Take all of it in!”</p> <p>Tom had his eyes closed as he pushed his dick into Becky’s pussy. He was in pure heaven. No one had ever felt so full of his dick as he was fucking Becky in front of her friends. He was afraid to come inside her, but he wanted to. Becky started moaning as she bounced with him up and down. She was feeling so good and so good in her pussy, and her pussy muscles spasmed and tightened around his dick. Tom felt like an orgasm coming on. It wasn’t easy, but he tried to hold it back.</p> <p>“Come inside me! Please, give me your cock, please, I want to feel it”</p> <p>Tom couldn’t hold it. He was so close and Becky made a noise that sounded like it was between a scream and a moan. Tom’s own hips started to jerk and twitch trying to make his sperm shoot deep inside her. The sensations seemed to last forever.</p> <p>They lay on the blanket, holding each other tightly, as the waves of pleasure continued to roll through them until finally, the waves of pleasure subsided. Tom was sure that every part of his dick felt as good as he had felt the first time he felt it in Becky’s pussy.</p> <p>Becky and Tom kissed for some time and then they got up and went back to their beds. They lay, spooning tightly, and eventually fell asleep, both of them feeling satisfied.</p> <p>Tom woke up on Thursday morning. It wasn’t exactly an ideal way to start the day and his eyes were still a little tired from the sex in their dreams. They had finished too. His mind was so very tired, too. just. The first time he had to sleep was just fall.
