They were on their way to the same college in the area that they had been assigned to. They had been there for a month and it was still several days before they could start dating.</p> <p>***</p> <p></p> <p>"So how's it going?" Elinor grinned warmly at Marianne.</p> <p>"Well, its going great," the girl replied, looking at the clock beside her bed. "Oh, I have to make it. The whole team is scheduled to arrive at six and they've been waiting for three weeks to make time to get here."</p> <p>"What about your Mom?"</p> <p>"My mother is going to kick me out," Marianne replied, the first time that she and the three of them had been alone since yesterday morning.</p> <p>"I love having time with you and the girls. I want to take them out to dinner tonight. We've had several hours of fun since they arrived."</p> <p>"We?"</p> <p>"I think that we should go too," Elinor looked expectantly at Marianne. "This can't turn into a family dinner. We need to get dressed." And Elinor was right. For whatever reason Marianne was not happy with herself. The idea of being naked in front of another girl while wearing all her clothing had been terribly humiliating. She had never been more embarrassed in her entire sexual career that she had become.</p> <p>"You don't really want us to go," Marianne finally answered.</p> <p>"Oh, that part doesn't change anything. I'm still a virgin," Elinor laughed in a mock-laugh.</p> <p>"How embarrassing," Marianne laughed. "In front of all those other naked girls."</p> <p>"And not only naked," Elinor laughed, pulling on the waistcoats she and Marianne had bought yesterday, and giving her sister's sister a big hug. "It'll be okay. I promise."</p> <p>"No... I mean... I'm sorry," Marianne mumbled, her heart breaking as she felt as if someone had punched her in the stomach.</p> <p>"It's okay. It's not a problem. You can tell me if you want," Elinor told her. "I've known my sister for years and we've known each other for hours. I'm not going to embarrass you."</p> <p>"It wasn't too embarrassing. I'll just have to have another look at this, I guess."</p> <p>"You've got a great body. I know that about you. I think that we'd better get dressed," Elinor said, taking the girl's hand and leading her slowly down the hallway to the bedroom.</p> <p>When they reached the bedroom together they paused. They exchanged a knowing look and then began to unbutton each other's blouses. Marianne shivered as the girl's bra-covered boobs squished against her own larger tits and she sighed in pleasure at the feel of the girl's soft skin against her own. She shuddered again when Marianne's hand made its way down to her crotch and massaged its softness.</p> <p>"God you're right. I should be scared," Marianne smiled. She had always admired those big breasts even though she had never had any real experience with them. Then again, she knew that most of the girls in her school looked at them as a means to an end, not as a means to get attention. She smiled at the realization that they were just as desirable as she thought they were and she squeezed the girl's soft body in hers. Marianne moaned when Elinor's hand slipped under her skirt, feeling for herself and, despite what her clothes would probably look like to any other girl, she had a hard time keeping her own underwear and panties from being on at the right moment.</p> <p>When Marianne's fingers came to rest on her clit, she sighed as it slowly made its way into her underwear.</p> <p>"Oh, damn," she sighed. She wasn't sure how far she should go with this. If only we were together now, she thought. But she didn't want to be wrong.</p> <p>***</p> <p></p> <p>As each girl entered the bedroom with the others for their make-up rehearsal another pair of hands joined in helping each girl remove her own blouse and skirt. As she slid down her panties and then her bra she saw that Marianne was already up there with her.</p> <p>As she approached, Marianne removed her top and then her bra. She felt like the last image of the girl to be naked was being the face of the girl she had loved for years. As she moved towards the bed, she was overcome by the excitement of what was about to come.</p> <p>to happen. The girls were so excited after their makeup rehearsal to get naked.</p> <p>The girls dressed The boys had to be each wearing only clothes for their makeup their make-â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
