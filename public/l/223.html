The Dart.</h4><p><strong>A word concerning an incident in the last chapter. According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as</strong> a mascot. The story goes about one of the whale-boat captains who makes a pass at the whale-boat's captain. It is the last chapter of the book and we decided it was time to get to the boat; this chapter is about one thing that was lost.</p> <p>If it were just the whales, she could have been a good teacher.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The time dragged but it was a good thing that she wasn't to be distracted. It was time. He was just a little over the hour. Just before the time came, her head was pounding. She was just so tired. Then, she felt his hands on her. He was caressing her shoulders. It had been a long time since anyone had done that, that's why it didn't come to her immediately. It was only a week since they last had sex. He knew just how to do it. Her body was reacting. Was this how she remembered, his hands caressing her shoulders, his tongue teasing her ear, his lips kissing her neck, his lips kissing her tits? Just as she recalled this, her body was reacting to it, her nipples were hard, she was feeling like she was on edge. The next breath was filled with her first orgasm of the night and she had barely been able to come to the second. By then, he was there rubbing her shoulders, she was just so tired, so out of it, but she just wanted more. But he stopped.</p> <p>"Are you still with me?" he whispered. Before her brain registered or even knew what he'd done, he slid up to lie next to her, wrapping his arms around her and caressing her. That would have been the end of one of the best orgasms of her life.</p> <p>"Just a little more," she managed to say. She was feeling like she could do it all again, even if she didn't think she could. But after what had transpired a month ago and now, what?</p> <p>His fingers teased her nipples and she moaned at the intense pleasure. She wanted to feel his touch there. And she wanted him to touch it!</p> <p>Her hands were on his shoulders, his hands on her tits. But his tongue played at her nipples, and then his mouth latched on them. She felt a bolt of bliss course through her breasts, she even moaned when that happened. She needed to come.</p> <p>His mouth found her belly button and she moaned again when that happened. He worked her sides, her tummy, her thigh. And again, his hands wandered up her body to just barely graze the hair on her belly.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said when the sensations returned. "I've just had a feeling..."</p> <p>That was when her body went into another one of those post-dizzy feelings she remembered so well when he touched her like that, with his fingers barely touching her.</p> <p>But then, he slid his finger into her hole, and she felt a bolt of bliss that spread through her whole body, and her body did the same thing. The next time she felt like she was going to explode, she remembered his hand on her pussy. The next time she felt that it happened, it triggered her own orgasm. Her body felt better than she had in a month.</p> <p>"Aaah..." she moaned as she came. It was so intense, so intense.</p> <p>She was completely out of it. Nothing felt better. It wasn't even as though she just gave pleasure, it was simply that, no matter how much she wanted to do that again, just because it felt like that, there was no turning backâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
