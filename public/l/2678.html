For</strong> the moment, the man would use the phrase 'pussy.'</p> <p>There was a short pause in the movement, and then, "What do we have there?" asked the voice. That's what the expression 'fuck' means, I thought, when the man said it. The expression of lust, desire, as a prelude to ejaculation might be construed as 'pussy,' in a way that would have sounded slightly obscene.</p> <p>It was the second man's turn to step in. "Pussy!"</p> <p>The first man took the stance, taking his weight in from the top of the sofa, his eyes moving from the woman to him.</p> <p>"Well, well, well, look at you! You're on the right path, now, at least to me!" said the first, and all hell broke loose there as the second man stepped out of view of the man. The third man stepped in behind, and took his place. "Come here, let us go."</p> <p>Now it would be easier to pretend it hadn't happened, though, if you knew that the first two men were 'playing with the merchandise.' Not all men were like that, and I didn't. I'd been on the receiving end of all sorts of groping before, as well as some of the sex acts I'd performed (when that first one started with my own eyes). Not all women were the same, and I liked that aspect. But you get the idea.</p> <p>A tall well-built, bald man, not much taller than me, stood on the other side. "Well," he began, not really looking at me, "what do you think?" He was tall enough to be our 'bouncer.' We took one step toward him with the intention of kissing or something, then the man took both hands and pressed them to his groin. "I don't think you've ever seen a real man's cock before," he said as if to me. His voice was low, and I could tell he was turned on by this. "If you don't mind, I was just hoping that you'd be comfortable."</p> <p>I stepped closer to him, and he wrapped his hands around my hips. "You ain't seen a real dick before, yet," he said with his voice, "now be quiet while I fuck you." He bent from the waist, and his hands took hold of my skirt, which was tucked in around my butt and pulled down. His finger slid along my crack, making it more prominent in relation to my waist, and he touched me up there, too.</p> <p>"What do you think they're going to do to you?" asked the third man.</p> <p>"They're going to fuck me in the ass!" I answered. The three men laughed and moved toward the sofa, and I took the chance to get close.</p> <p>"You like it in the butt?" asked the first. He stepped into my space with his legs, and one of his fingers slid inside my pussy. "It's not as painful as getting it on the first time, but it feels good."</p> <p>The third man had his cock at the entrance to my pussy, and moved forward. He rubbed it against my slit a few times, and then slid in. Another man, bigger than me, stepped behind me. I felt that hard shaft rub against my pussy lips, and it sent a thrill all over me. I turned on the spot, and the man put that cock in me, to the first man.</p> <p>"You're first," he said as both cocks in me began to work in and out. "I told you to go for it."</p> <p>He moved his hips just a little bit, and the head of that strange cock slid over my clit. The other two moved to the other sofa, and the new man's cock slid along my pussy. I was hot to see the two men fuck me in the ass, and I wanted to lick them, too.</p> <p>The man took his time, not missing a beat. He had the head of his cock just inside of me at the opening of my canal and was now in a slightly more forceful manner, as if he knew he was stretching something, and he was ready to take it.</p> <p>The third man was in a rush. He withdrew and stood in front of the sofa, facing the third. He turned his head, and his face was close to mine. His eyes were wide, and he was breathing rapidly.</p> <p>"You ready, baby?" he said. Just a little.</p> <p>"Yeah, I am."</p> <p>"It's big."</p> <p>"Don't worry. You'll love it."</p> <p>the man was smiling again. "It may hurt a little more than this first time." but I had to be gentle after all that first, and to start with patience would have the second time. his cock inâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
