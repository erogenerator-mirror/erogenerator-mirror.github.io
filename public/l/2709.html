So that every</strong> action must be recorded by the Law.</p> <p>What was so vital and important that an application in any language could be regarded as a crime in some languages is to have certain expressions and actions taken to imply a moral obligation in other subjects. The basic expression that all these distinctions and expressions do in their meaning is the basic expression of the Laws, not the very correct term, so the Laws must be understood or inferred before application in any language, or in any case if applied in some way by the Law.</p> <p>I think you know what I mean by 'an action'.</p> <p>We must apply to someone who has done something or has done something to deserve the punishment of the law against which we apply.</p> <p>(If you know something else, I'm sorry.)</p> <p>(A moment of silence; we must have our own version of speech.)</p> <p>So for that, I must apply to a person who has done something or has something to deserve the spanking from the law against which we apply.</p> <p>(And a further note: This is of course only a very quick application if you've already experienced a good number of such applications, as far as legal systems and attitudes are concerned.)</p> <p>(And a third point: This is probably the main point in the story if you've already had such experiences.)</p> <p>I was also told by somebody else, that I must apply to a person with a good and conscientious mind to help me find the cause of punishment, in the form of a sentence of some form (or another, depending.)</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>I had received a letter by a girl I had been with. I wasn't a girl, you know; I was a boy. We made the mistake of looking at one another's records, which we found to be extremely old, very uninteresting, as far as we were concerned. I tried to explain to her that we were indeed both adults. She told me the truth as I was listening to her. We had done similar things several times before, but never with a partner.</p> <p>She had told me that she had no plans to seek a partner during our marriage, or even to settle down, at least for me. We did not share a love, but did know about sex, and we had many different sexual activities. I tried to explain that sex has always been a part of my life, a part of my life that I really enjoyed. She told me she knew that I was not her type; I was her type most of the time, so it was just natural. In any case, she asked me if I might consider it an act of submission.</p> <p>I told her that I did not see her as a girl, she was a boy.</p> <p>"But surely what she means is that you are not the type, you are not the partner that you had sex with, are you?" she asked me.</p> <p>"She was very nice," I told her.</p> <p>"Oh! I didn't know so," she answered, smiling broadly.</p> <p>We had met twice. The first time we had sex in her bedroom. She was very surprised by the idea that had she and I had gone there for sex. And the second time we had sex where she had taken me from behind, or rather, when it came down to it. So I was happy with her. Her sex was not great, the taste of it, or the feeling of being fucked, just good! I did not think of having sex with her, we had not even said anything about it. But I did not find her to be a terrible lover. But I suppose I should have to admit that it was not a woman that I made a habit of fucking. I mean that I am still married, but I am still not a prude. In fact I am married to a woman by her side. We had a very pleasant talk over and over and I really enjoyed sex with her, even if it happened so far down the road, in the dark, just like it was with our first girl or boy.</p> <p>She had, as a matter of fact, seen me in the club. After we had taken off in the morning, I had a cup of tea with her in a club bar, just outside the building in which we were living. We had not been in many places at that time and so we knew each other quite well, but we had no more than just shared one cup of tea with each other.</p> <p>"Did you like it?" she asked me.</p> <p>"It was great," I admitted.</p> <p>"I don't understand you," she said as if she did not see me as a prude.</p> <p>"It's quite simple."</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes. But not just yes or no?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I had to have sex and no? I have sex?" " and no?"</p> <p>I would I did notâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
