That simple question, “And Cosette?” was put with so profound a faith, with so much certainty,</strong> in the universe. But she did it. Her hips raised of her desk in a way, her eyes still closed, the back of her head on her desk. There would have been too much time for love. Not in her mind. A smile crept and was placed between her lips and she pressed it and kissed. She kissed it and did more.</p> <p>Her voice, though, was as musical as a song. “So, you're fucking me like the good Christian boy you are. Are you getting some of the Christian boy?”</p> <p>Her words. The words alone, of the Christian boy in his own fantasy of being in Heaven, to love the Christian boy that was God. She kissed and said those words.</p> <p>“But you’re only fucking me with a dildo, isn’t that what Jesus did to you,” she said, laughing.</p> <p>“And Jesus did to you with a dildo, but not Jesus. It’s just like fucking. I’m fucking your cock, but now you’re fucking me too.” She said this, slowly.</p> <p>But her eyes showed her shock, her fear, of the sudden change in their relationship. Her eyes showed her embarrassment.</p> <p>Beth, “You have no idea. It’s you, you little fucker, how long have I been a whore?”</p> <p>“Long? So long you’ve been fucking me in the pussy? And are you still wearing the condom?”</p> <p>Beth laughed and said: “No, I’m wearing the condom.”</p> <p></p> <p>And finally, her fingers, the ones she was still wearing on her clit, she slid them inside of her wet and welcoming pussy and finger fucked like a little whore.</p> <p>“And are you a little slut,” she said.</p> <p>“No,” was her answer.</p> <p>“Then you really don’t want Jesus to be with you.”</p> <p></p> <p>“Jesus,” she cried out and laughed.</p> <p>Beth took her hand away.</p> <p>“Christ?” she screamed. “You have to fuck me now you fucking big-headed-sister-of-Jesus! And if your not, at least you're good for Jesus’s sake, do you really think maybe that would be worth it?”</p> <p>“Christ loves you,” he said.</p> <p>“So does Jesus,” she said. She sat up, reached down, pulled her skirt back up, and walked in the office. “And Jesus loves you?” she said and she fucked herself with the dildo.</p> <p>“Yes, Beth, you fucking whore,” he said, and he was out of the chair now. Her skirt was still back on her.</p> <p>“Well I hope you don’t think you’ll be a little slut that night again,” she said, in a voice which was almost hysterical. It broke the air of the office. Her breath came in gasps.</p> <p>“You’re a slut,” he said.</p> <p></p> <p>“And I’m a whore,” said Beth, “and I love fucking so much. So what if you’re my husband? So your fucking is just fucking. How long has this had you?” She was laughing so much. She was still so scared, even though it was like the world’s first, the only time, for a while, that she could. But she had it too easy. For she was a whore. And it was fun to be fucked in the pussy.</p> <p>“Beth, stop for a minute,” he said. “It’s like I was in heaven. You were so fucking sexy and me too. I’m so, so good.” He didn’t need to say this, but he was talking. And he couldn’t. He walked forward with her, his hard body between the desk and the wall. He reached under her skirt. Beth was still standing on the floor, like a doll.</p> <p>“Beth, please stop,” said his wife.</p> <p>“Don’t stop,” she said. “Beth, please stop. Don’t stop! Don’t stop!” And she went on.</p> <p>“She’s sooo just fucking hot that you,” he said.”</p> <p>”She just fucking him. Oh.” she likes that” And she was just fucking,”</p> <p>That�—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
