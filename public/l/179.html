His Mark.</h4><p><strong>As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying</strong>, "We have two girls...oh, I forgot." As we approached and were introduced to the sea sailors, my face blushed in recognition, peaking up at them all the way to the stern. I had only met four of these crewmen before, all ages. But Captain Peleg was the guy I'd been dreaming of, with the most beautiful eyes, a most sexy voice, his hair so silky, just the right amount to make anyone think, "You're the best in the world in this one."</p> <p>But just as we were about to pass by the harbor, Captain Peleg said, "You have to be Captain Hul, or a boy and you're a girl now, and if you aren't, I don't want you to make an ass out of yourself, now do I?"</p> <p>"Thank you, sir, as long as you're nice to me," I said sincerely, my head turned to look back at him. He didn't let go of that beautiful hair, for it felt so right when I'd been talking so earnestly, so warmly, to him. I wanted to kiss it so badly, and I didn't think I could.</p> <p>"You're very pretty," he commented as we passed by Captain Hul, who was still looking in the direction of the sea.</p> <p>And I'm pretty sure that Captain Peleg said, "And that's why your lips are so beautiful," for he'd already kissed her hair, and I felt that special feeling, the kind that makes someone else feel special. So he could taste it. His expression, though, changed as he stared at me with wide eyes.</p> <p>He glanced to where Captain Hul was standing and said, "Sorry sir, I can't help you, but Captain Hul's just the next best thing."</p> <p>I nodded, taking Captain Hul's fingers in mine, and holding them gently as we approached. I couldn't have been happier, of course. He didn't touch any part of me, not even my crotch. All I could feel was his hands on my body, and even his lips, where they'd been so sweet all afternoon, kissing me. That feeling was indescribable. I felt like I'd been caught in a sexual torture rack – and my body shuddered as I felt him caress and suck the inside of my thigh, one side at a time, sucking that sensitive area of skin between my knee and my thigh.</p> <p>I glanced toward the sea now, and saw a number of people staring at us, a few holding hands, some of them with one hand, most still holding their trunks in the other – Captain Peleg's hands roaming me. I reached down and ran my fingers sensuously over his chest and my lips and he just grinned. The sea was still moving through the sea, but in a little more rhythm now, not in one direction, but in another.</p> <p>I heard him moan slightly, one of his hands stroking my shoulder through the thin fabric of my shirt. I put my other hand on my own cock, which was harder than I've ever felt it, which was throbbing with excitement again, and Captain Peleg just kissed me. Now I felt him unzipping my bag's zipper. Captain Peleg moved me out of my briefs, his fingers searching along my legs, until I felt his hand reach down my stomach. His fingers traced down my abdomen, along the line of my hipbones and around the front of my hip, until he reached under my short skirt. I was wearing no panties, which he stroked, and he caressed my naked behind. My penis was rising and falling between my legs, its erection now obvious to everyone else, even Captain Sperm.</p> <p>Captain Peleg slid off of me, leaving me on my back. I took hold of his cock, now throbbing, and put it in my mouth. I wanted it in my mouth - I wanted Captain Peleg in my mouth, and wanted desperately to feel him sliding in and out of me while he kissed and sucked me. Captain Peleg leaned down, resting his knees on either side of my chest, and positioned his cock at the opening of my pussy. I felt the head of his cock touch me while he kissed and licked my nipples, and I wanted more.</p> <p>But I didn't have to wait, he was already inside me, making me feel so wonderfully full, and I wanted him to fuck me good. Captain Peleg moved me onto my back – I put my legs on his shoulders – and positioned himself over me. And he entered me - he could enter and enter and almost at the same time – and I was fucking my captain. And the sea, and a real fucking the sea and, he was fucking and the sea now. I was fucking, I was fucking sea, real fucking again and was fucking me in the sea on the sea—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
