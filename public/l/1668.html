It embarrassed her; for in a cooler, quieter moment it appeared to her, absurd that she should have</strong> responded positively, even as the words rang out in his ears as a signal of hope.</p> <p>Edna felt the warmth and comfort of his body against hers. Her legs spread as wide as they could. Edna felt safe and warm. He was an artist, and her body was made that way. She didn't want to be pregnant.</p> <p>Edna opened her legs for him, and spread her labia slightly, feeling herself already lubricating. Her fingers played and explored in her cunt, taking her time.</p> <p>His warm, callous tongue probed her opening, which she held closed with her fingers. Edna loved how his head dipped between her legs to run circles around her clit. Her body shuddered. She knew it wouldn't be easy to push him away, she just wanted to feel his presence before he entered her body.</p> <p>He lifted up on his elbows. His mouth covered hers. His tongue sought her mouth, his lips. The contact made her gasp aloud.</p> <p>Edie gently pushed him away.</p> <p>He knelt and pushed her forward until she was almost on her hands and knees, then he knelt. She held his head against her breasts as he licked her and kissed her, tasting her skin. He tasted that pussy. Edie loved licking a girl's pussy. He licked in between her breasts, down her belly, between her legs, and finally, up her thighs.</p> <p>Edie moved forward, offering her mouth to him again.</p> <p>Edie closed her eyes and imagined that he was eating her pussy. She tasted her own juices on a mouthful of his breath. Would he try it? Would he try to fuck her?</p> <p>Edie felt his tongue penetrate her labia. She felt him licking her. She felt him licking her. There was a difference between the experience of him licking her and pleasuring her. She could feel him spreading her lips apart with his fingers and gently, slowly, slide his tongue inside her pussy.</p> <p>She could feel him licking her, but she didn't feel the tongue. It moved back to her clit. Edie's fingers wrapped themselves inside her opening, and her hands caressed his head. His tongue explored her.</p> <p>"That's it," she whispered, and he could barely hear it.</p> <p>Edina had never felt anyone's tongue as it gently fucked its way between her swollen lips. Her body tensed and trembled as her hips bucked up and down. She felt his tongue penetrate her.</p> <p>Edie felt Edina's clit. She could feel his hand inside her opening, stroking her flesh while he licked her. His tongue moved in circles over her clit, sending waves of pleasure through her. She reached back and clutched him there, her ass pushing back. She loved his mouth on her pussy. He'd bring her to an orgasm! A shudder of pleasure went up through her body. Edina's hands went back over her shoulders and slid down her chest and up to her breasts. She squeezed them, feeling her nipples tighten and her pussy pulse as she got closer and closer.</p> <p>Edina moved her hips up and down in a rising rhythm. She wanted to experience a different kind of sex, one that she'd never experienced before. Edina's hips moved in a higher frequency and more rhythmic.</p> <p>His mouth sucked her clit between his lips, as he fingered her opening. Edina writhed. She felt him in her. She looked down. Her eyes were riveted to his face as her orgasm overcame her. The feeling was intense. Edina's orgasm started in her abdomen, flowed into her pubic hair and spread all down her belly and thighs. She felt him moving inside of her. His fingers were stroking her insides. The waves of pleasure rolled along side of them. Edina lay on her stomach, feeling the pleasure rippling through her. Edina could feel his body, lying behind her, touching her back.</p> <p>Edina felt his fingers touch her lips. Her eyes looked up.</p> <p>Edie's knees were up, knees pointing, but her legs were spread open. She felt his hands on her ass. He fingered her while he licked her. She felt her orgasm build. She opened her eyes to see Edina's hands on her, his face buried between her legs, while his mouth fucked her pussy, as her orgasm peaked.</p> <p>Edie felt herself come. Her knees shook against her. It was so intense. Her body shook, with waves of pleasure racing through her. Edie looked down. Her nipples were erect. Her body was alive. She couldn't stop the ecstasy from growing in her womb. Her body.</p> <p></p> <p>Edie was the center. She looked over and felt the center. That was the center. The center.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The woman was her center.
