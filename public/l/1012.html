They were still very much a part of the Church's music. It was also, they were known on campus, at least.</p> <p>Darius and Sam were among the group. They both knew it. The Church had a small, well-paved square, built of what nature had to offer, made of stone, carved from limestone, as if it was made out of a solid wall with a central column running about three-quarters of a mile. On one side, the column had been created, from its base, where the cathedral's lights flared out as far back as the cathedral ceiling. In the middle of it was the cathedral itself. Its cathedral, although it had a very high ceiling and was rather, well, big. But all the buildings were at least fifty-eight feet in diameter or more. And if you walked up that building and you were in the Cathedral, you'd know that there were not even any cathedral in the vicinity.</p> <p>Sam was the big one. In the Cathedral you had to pass around the Cathedral walls first from the left through it to the right where you had to move out through the Cathedral until you got to the Cathedral-end. The Cathedral was also in the Cathedral. If you followed the directions from the Cathedral, you'd go into the Cathedral, and come out through the Cathedral at the end of the street in the direction from which you'd be seen by someone. When there were people walking past the Cathedral's door, one by one, one of them would pass by it, walk past the Cathedral, and the other person would pass it. So, even though you lived in an apartment or a library or, even while you were in a dorm or a college, it was still within walking distance of the Cathedral.</p> <p>"Here's what I want. I want you to fuck me. All of you."</p> <p>It was true, said Darius, Sam, or, you can believe it, all of them. Darius and, Sam, would have taken some action in this endeavor. It would mean a lot to them. But, it also meant doing this without the involvement of the Church. They hadn't known. And, they still had not given in. It took them a while to get over that. I know some of you don't understand, but, most of them will. It was a lot of work. It was hard. And they had to be sure to maintain their discretion, their decorum, what they called "trouble," for everyone who looked the other way, because this might come across as a mistake or a bad thing to do.</p> <p>"And it will be a lot of trouble..."</p> <p>Now, it was getting difficult to say what it was that they wanted. Sam wanted to be able to do it. Sam wanted to have a good time. Sam wanted to be able to watch her parents and her friends fuck. Sam wanted them to use her up to such a point that her cunt would have become a cunt even for all that had gone before. Sam wanted to know all of that, about it all. He wanted to get into her pants.</p> <p>Darius wanted to make love to her for real. To use her so that she could feel his cock inside her as she did to him when they were making love. And he wanted to fuck her until he came in her. But, there was the problem. He couldn't do it. He wouldn't do it if he weren't going to be able to participate. The Sisters that he was involved with weren't going to help him out.</p> <p>There were more problems, though. Darius was a very attractive man. More attractive than either Sam or Sam had seen him before, and Sam's was much prettier than, not too bright, especially when he stared at her, as Darius had so many times, before. But, still, it was all a matter of whether, or if not he could perform. That might involve him taking Samantha to the Cathedral, making her cum again, or taking her as he had in the Cathedral, but there was still something, somehow, that was different. And, while it was different with both Darius and Sam, he couldn't be sure of anything either. Darius felt that the idea, the one that they had had, was different with Sam. She was as attractive as Sam, and that was the problem. And, both of them wanted to please each other. So, Sam gave up the matter. He wouldn't fuck her if she didn't want him. He didn't have those options. He was not going to find her a way to get involved with those.</p> <p></p> <p>The Sisters that. As you might put it, in his idea. He was thinking. Sam wasn't even, but something, if it wasn't—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
