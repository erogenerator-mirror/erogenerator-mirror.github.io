She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little</strong> closet to change, She'd found a box of lubricant in the middle of the day. She'd been tempted to try it, for reasons that could be entirely different from human masturbation, but when she'd looked under it in her search for something different—a dildo—she'd failed to find anything, but what she did now found was a small tube of lubricant. She smiled to herself when she looked over the label. 'Fisting.'</p> <p>"Oh, wow," she said as she began to put the lubricant and the toys all together. "The thought of having these wonderful instruments in my ass—not all of them, and not even all at once, but, uh...they should have a nice shape and feel for a while."</p> <p>"How are they?" Tom asked.</p> <p>"Pretty good," Elizabeth said, "but probably wouldn't fit in that little bit between my legs if I did," she continued as she squeezed a couple of handfuls of the lube together, and coated one with a couple of inches of silicone. She took a few steps into the closet, then stopped, looking over at the bed. "I'll be the one with the dicks?" She asked.</p> <p>"Huh?" Tom replied, a tad puzzled.</p> <p>"The strap-on dildos?" Elizabeth continued, squirting a bit more lubricant onto it and stroking it. She rubbed it a moment and looked at herself in the mirror over Tom's bed, taking it in hand.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you with that," she said. She then began pushing in, but stopped just as she slid halfway in.</p> <p>"Oh, god," Tom said in horror as the phallus slowly disappeared inside him. "But—oh—God, it feels wonderful! I need to—" Elizabeth was laughing as she slid back out.</p> <p>"Just relax," he continued, looking over at the mirror as his wife fucked him with the strap-on dildo. With a final shove, his dick came up tight in the dildo, but she held him in place while she took it out again.</p> <p>"Now...uh...just do it!" she ordered in amusement. Elizabeth was leaning over him as she began sliding the cock up and down his asshole. Her tits hung down below him, and her hard nipples rubbed against his upper arms.</p> <p>"But—uh, don't tell me you want the dildo in your ass," Tom pleaded.</p> <p>"I want—" Elizabeth said, as she slid the dildo in again, "—to let you get used to it." His eyes were filled with passion as she plunged the fake cock back in. She squeezed a couple more handfuls of lubricant into her hand, and stroked the other dildo with it as she fucked herself with the strap-on dildo.</p> <p>"Ah...I can't," he muttered. His dick was hard as a rock from hearing her talking him through the strap-on dildo. He felt himself slowly sliding forward into the harness. He could hardly believe any woman he was fucking right now would get so turned on watching him get fucked. But he couldn't help himself from feeling his dick pushing against the harness between his legs.</p> <p>Elizabeth was in the midst of sliding back out of his ass as she fucked him through the harness. She was grinning, but her face wasn't any less serious. "Do whatever you like with this thing, honey," she said in a deep, sexy voice, and began working the dildo up into his ass once again, sliding out only to slam back in. "It's so fucking powerful," she continued, "and so fucking smooth."</p> <p>Tom's eyes were all over her, feeling her sexy form under the dildos. His dick was throbbing as he imagined his wife fucking another man. His cock was rock hard as Elizabeth was fucking him through the harness, looking over at the mirror, seeing her reflection in her reflection through the strap-on dildo. He felt so incredibly sexy doing this on that cock, feeling it slide smoothly in and out of him with each withdrawal and release of Elizabeth's legs from behind to come up, the latex dildo disappearing over the tip of his bare member as she slid it in and out.</p> <p>"Tom," Elizabeth said in a low, throaty voice, "would you like to come in me..."</p> <p>Tom groaned as he came up behind her on the bed. He was about to lose it, but Elizabeth took it away from Tom, and instead began to suck him and rub against him, which made him nearly lose himself as he came. Then she pulled her mouth away from his dick and his eyes. "I want to see you come...right"</p> <p></p> <p>Tom's "I want to come really hard," her mouth, and did her, "But, "I wanna come really—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
