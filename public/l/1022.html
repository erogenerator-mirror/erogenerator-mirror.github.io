To whom? To God. To pray to God,—what is the meaning of these words? Is there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent, permanent; necessarily substantial,</strong> self sufficient, unenaturally limitless, immoveable, unselfconscious, incomparable, omnipotent, utterly, inexhaustible. A divine being is only finite, unselfish, self sufficient, unimaginably self-aware, unselfish. The infinite, unbounded, incomparable, self-sufficient, unselflessly limitless, unselfless, immovable, utterly limitless, self-aware, unselfless, self-releasing, unselfish, unselfconscious, unselfconscious, unselfish. Can any immortal existence be limitless or unfathomable or unselfish? Can we live forever forever?</p> <p>"God?"</p> <p>"Yes," my ex-girlfriend promised.</p> <p>"Let's fuck," my ex-girlfriend promised.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, "I know. Let's do it. God's cock is big."</p> <p>"You think so?"</p> <p>"I'm hoping so," I said, "but there's no other word."</p> <p>"Is there?"</p> <p>"Is there?" I didn't even ask that.</p> <p>"Yeah, Jesus," she said.</p> <p>"Yes, there's a fucking God," I said, "and Jesus is a goddamn fucking God."</p> <p>"It's not the God thing is it?" she said, "Is there?"</p> <p>"The God thing's what?"</p> <p>"The God thing is the fucking thing that's got fucking Jesus on it," she said.</p> <p>"The God thing's what. The God thing's not God thing's."</p> <p>"I don't even know," she said.</p> <p>"I know," I said, "but the God thing's what gives the fucking thing the big fucking fucking deal."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>My ex-girlfriend and I spent the rest of the afternoon and early the next evening doing it all again.</p> <p>"Do you want to hear the fucking thing again?" she said. "That it's the fucking thing I want to hear!"</p> <p>"We can't. I'll say it again if I have to" and then I added, "I can't fuck."</p> <p>"I'll know."</p> <p>"I'm just doing it."</p> <p>"What does this God thing have to do with fucking?" she demanded.</p> <p>"It's not God thing," I said.</p> <p>"You are talking shit!"</p> <p>"We gotta. I'm here," I said.</p> <p>"I'm not doing anything. Go and have a fucking nice sex life, let Christ fuck whatever he bloody pleases. I'm fucking a bunch of people! I'm fucking a bunch of fucking God damned fucking people!" she said.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus," I said.</p> <p>"God damned Jesus," I agreed.</p> <p>We had a good time, our first fuck as I promised. She was a fantastic fuck.</p> <p>I was surprised, it must have been a hundred times more fantastic than I could have imagined, even if she had fucked me, but she told me not to worry about it. She explained that she was the only one who had fucked Christ before God had fucked me.</p> <p>Our first fuck was in our garden on the back-seat of Jesus' car which was in the garden next to ours. Not bad, but not bad for a hundred bucks. It was a nice car. There was an impossibly good looking woman on the steering wheel sitting with a guy's arm around her. A good looking guy. There were a dozen or so other cars in the garden.</p> <p>Then I was taking her home, and she was being fucked. We had a lovely fuck. It would be fun, but there were not enough people in the garden to take our precautions. We would be walking back and forth. I would be walking with her and she could get fucked by the hundred other guys.</p> <p>We went home early, after another round of fucking. We fucked five times. At that moment, I got off the bed and moved around to lie on my back.</p> <p>"Where do I touch you?" she asked.</p> <p>She pulled off my cock, and I got a surprise. She got me. When I came, she made me cum again. I wanted to get off but she pulled my cock away. Then I got on my back again and she got on top of me again. She rode me. She fucked me like a cowgirl. Christ, she rode me. She made me cum again too.</p> <p>We lay in each other's arms, kissing, kissing and kissing. She gave me an idea. If some stranger approached us, and, I was to fuck Jesus. and I was to fuck her, then. a new fucking her, we were to her, I was to fuck again I was to fuck her God.
