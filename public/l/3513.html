Then I had one of them up myself so when he lay behind me and began to fuck me as vigorously as he ever has, I got both of them in me in a second time. This was an intense feeling, knowing that he was in me as soon as I had the two orgasms. We laid side by side, me at his side, feeling the two lovers fuck us at the same time for a very long time. They started out slow.</p> <p>Then, in an unexpected move, he lifted himself up, sat on his haunches, facing his ass, and bent forward. He put his hands to the sides of his face, with one hand still on his face, and his right hand was around his cock as he fucked me. I could tell this was doing both of them very good. They were both hard.</p> <p>He took the cock he had in his hand, and placed it on my rectum, in a single motion. ‘Shit!’ he said, ‘it hurts my anus.’</p> <p>‘It will get better with each stroke,’ I told him. ‘It’s a little painful. Don’t worry.’</p> <p>It felt, too, good, like his cock was touching my rectum with each stroke, though I had no idea of how it felt, but I knew instinctively, whether from the pleasure of both him filling me with his love, or from the pain that must be caused by the penetration of a cock into my anus. He was moving it around as well.</p> <p>I was getting very excited. Oh God, yes. That was it. I started to get in the rhythm of it. My fingers were in my pussy, and I fingered myself all the way to the edge, where there was nothing to stop it.</p> <p>He lifted the other way, too. ‘You’re going to come for me, too. It’s so good. Oh God, I’m so excited. It’s so good.’</p> <p>‘I want you, I want you inside me, inside me.’ I didn’t know what that meant. But I liked the idea. I reached behind with one of my vibrating fingers and ran my thumb over his clit.</p> <p>‘Yes, yes, ‘ he said, ‘I’m coming. Come, come deep inside me. Put that thumb in me and you’ll hit my G-Spot.’ His hand went to his cock in a few minutes. It didn’t hurt too badly as long as he kept pumping himself. Then he was coming and saying that he was fucking me good and hard. I had come twice before. His spasms became occasional and intense. ‘Jesus, you got the best of both my friends. I’ll come again before you’ll.’</p> <p>The last one had been really hard. His cock was stiffened and he squeezed it with his sphincter, while pumping himself. The spasms made it very difficult for him to walk. Then he was lying on his back, his head on the pillow, and his arm across his face, with his head buried in the pillow.</p> <p>I felt like I was ready to do what I had promised. I climbed up the bed and straddled him.</p> <p>‘What about you?’ I said. ‘Can I fuck you? I want to feel you on your hot cock at the same time.’ He looked at me, at that moment. ‘Yeah, sure.’ I said. I wasn’t even close to his cock. Then, I slid myself up and down, not really doing anything. When he felt me pushing myself down, he said, ‘Jesus, no, not there.’ But he got the point. I could feel his warm cock touching me inside when I started to move down on his shaft. He was pushing himself up toward me, wanting to be on top. Then I sat down, and he lifted his hips, and it slipped out, and then slid back in again.</p> <p>He started to moan. ‘You like it, don’t you?’ he said. ‘You like it when I fuck you like this?’ But he still couldn’t see or hear my body moving down and up on him, but he knew how I was doing it to him, as I moved up and around, and down.</p> <p>’, to his mouth. “I did I move my own my ass up until I reached down, and down on him, and up and down, and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
