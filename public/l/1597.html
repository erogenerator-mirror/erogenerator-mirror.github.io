She had such a brilliant imagination and even though she was an elementary school teacher, she had also a natural bright mind and never would have guessed that one of the brightest students in biology had such an impressive understanding of scientific learning. Emma was not only very talented in the field of biology but also in the way of science - she had even been fascinated in her lab lab when she first went on a trip to a special class that was just beginning.</p> <p>Emma spent her time at Swensen's office as the late-teen student was in her mid-thirties and had been in love with her until now. Emma and Swensen had been friends since elementary school but now that she had her research and experience, they still seemed closer than ever before. Emma was very self-centred and her work was actually boring. In fact, she was becoming frustrated sexually. Emma wanted to get herself laid and had begun to develop a crush on her friend. Emma never really knew that a crush on a girl, but she did know that she had had lesbian thoughts and desires for several years now.</p> <p>Swensen liked the young lady's body and the body that her hands and fingers could caress. Emma's lips and her mouth made her pussy get wet whenever she got excited. This was one of those times. Emma was the kind of girl who would do anything for the most part no matter how much she'd rather let go. Swensen especially liked being a virgin. It was kind of a turn-on to her even though she did enjoy masturbating when she had the chance. Her mother was now a widower on an extremely ill health. Emma preferred to masturbate at home and was still highly experimental sexually since she and her roommate, Julie, had experimented with oral sex.</p> <p>Emma had also never experienced sex in her life. Emma was a lesbian and she had always been afraid that she might become promiscuous. She was never afraid that an intense interest in science would lead her to being alone in her study period. Now, however, Emma was a sexual addict and in her late thirties, she was still discovering things about sex that hadn't been possible before. Emma had never had the courage to tell her friend her secret sexual preferences. Emma was ashamed by the things she had done that she had to tell her. As it turned out, the sex that Emma was having with her friend was amazing. She was sure that the girls in science would get wet. She could easily feel how wet her pussy got when she was doing that. Maybe Emma was being bisexual as she couldn't ever have been attracted to sex as much as she wanted to, she thought. But she also didn't have any way to prove it. Even though she had never had a sexual relationship with a guy, it had been easy to imagine that, if she had done the right thing with a guy, that she wouldn't do the same with another guy. It was just a stupid way to prove to yourself that she wasn't even really capable of having sex with a girl. But she did love sex when she was in that mood.</p> <p>Emma had felt such a strong attraction to Swensen for quite a while now. She had been a virgin, after all. Emma had never been attracted to women until one night when she was lying on her bed watching television when she started doing some porn video. Emma began fingering her pussy while watching the lesbian porn and soon came hard from just sitting there watching. She had come harder and harder as she watched the lesbian sex show on TV and fingered her pussy more vigorously as she watched herself get fucked by two guys.</p> <p>After a while and many more orgasms, she just knew that she was going to enjoy herself there. That's why she had invited Swensen to her house for the visit in the first place. She wondered if this was just another way to do something sexual, to try and see how long it would be before she joined their little incest sorority. Emma just hoped that there would be some way to prove to herself that she loved this way of being fucked by another guy. It felt so good - as opposed to when she had sex.</p> <p>Unfortunately Emma was feeling lonely as well as horny. She spent most of her day on the library staff and couldn't let anyone know that she wouldn't be coming to work on Saturdays because she had other classes then school. Most of all the male scientists - in class. Most of them - the biology, Emma thought, She thought, She knew her professor. Some of course science and all that she also thought she was the same. She is a scientist as well - all of the same science. Science and Science as well.</p> <p></p> <p>Forâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
