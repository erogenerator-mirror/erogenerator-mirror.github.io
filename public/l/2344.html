G. Wells </h3><h4>The Time Traveller’s Return</h4><p><strong>“So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed, the sun got golden</strong> and even the day seemed a little shorter. The morning light was brighter but still not brilliant. I came home. So I slept. I slept. And woke suddenly. I came. This was the first time in my life I did not have a hard cock or a dildo. But, at night, I masturbated. In bed. And slept."</p> <p>Saying that, she leaned down over me on her hands and knees. And her face went to my cock. She started at the head, running her tongue around her lips but never taking my cock completely into her mouth, she kept her eyes closed and she had a dreamy look on her face. She was like a girl who had gone to a party. And I was the first man to have fucked her like she was a woman she didn't know. She was like a virgin at the beach, no one could hold her hand. It was all the same:</p> <p>All men want a virgin. All women are sluts.</p> <p>All men are whores.</p> <p>All women are whores.</p> <p>All men want a virgin.</p> <p>The only difference between girls and women is that some women are more experienced than others. And some of them are less inexperienced. Some whores want an experience of life and experience is more important than experience.</p> <p>She continued to run her tongue around her lips. She sucked some more and then released my cock from her mouth and crawled down to the floor.</p> <p>“I will be your first. I want to be your first. You have chosen me already. I will have to pay for my mistakes.”</p> <p>She got up and I felt something she had never done. She took my cock in her hand and I got aroused. She put her lips over my cock and began to suck again. In my mind, she was giving me a blow job. She seemed to have changed something in my life, as if she was sucking me for the first time and I had enjoyed it. My cock throbbed and grew to it's full size aching hardness. She pulled back up and kissed my lips. I couldn't hold on any more and came in her mouth. She looked at me and smiled, and then her smile disappeared and she got up and got on all fours. She looked at me and then back at the floor. And I watched in amazement and pleasure as she raised her ass up and then spread her legs a bit so she could show me her pussy.</p> <p>She opened her lips with her fingers and looked back at me. She reached towards my cock. I started to move towards her, I kept my eyes on her finger and mouth, she had no doubts who she was at that moment and I wanted to take her right there. She didn't say a word. She just looked back at me and I went towards her pussy and slowly I put the head of my cock inside her and her body began to shake and her moans were loud. I looked towards my camera and saw, in front of me, an image of a woman's pussy, its lips parted by fingers of a man, its eyes fixed on that woman's sex. It looked as if she was inviting me into her mind and body.</p> <p>Finally, I made my move. I put the head of my cock in her, I felt a surge of emotion and excitement then again as I plunged my cock further inside her, feeling the tightness of her body and the smoothness of her pussy. My cock had fully penetrated her to the full nine inches. Now I put the full length of my cock inside her. Now my whole length was inside her and I felt the deep satisfaction of feeling her body's tight muscles around my cock.</p> <p>I felt as though I was entering into a dream. She kept her eyes on me as she took in a deep breath and let it out without saying an word. I pushed my cock a couple of more inched then pulled out and came all the way in again and again. My arms were around her back to lift her weight and she put a hand on my chest and pushed back with her body towards the rhythm of my cock with a smile on her face. I looked at her face for a minute. We had come to a conclusion. Together we were lost in the beauty of our being.</p> <p>She had never been this turned on before and we just held each other. I thought that there could be no chance to fuck her any more after all this time. I started to move my cock in and out of her pussy as she held me. But, I felt that if I used my cock as I saw in the movie, I was going to get a much bigger cock with a bigger cock. The big one. So big I had no mercy, but I had to give you. I had to please me my lover. For now you.’ll. I had to fuck you—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
