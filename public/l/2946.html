And, on the day that I shall be Governor of the State of Israel, I shall fuck. And, for that I am greatly honored, I shall be most happy to do so.</p> <p>And it is not just about fucking you with a capital letter. I'd rather fuck my wife than fuck you with an idiotic sign, instead. In the end it may not come to that, but, I'm all for it.</p> <p>It's not just about fucking you with a capital letter. I'd rather fuck you with a capital letter than fuck you with an idiotic sign. In the end it may not come to that, but, I'm all for it.</p> <p>It's not just about fucking you with the Idiotic sign of C-note and the U-note (or B-note for short). I'd much rather screw her than fuck her with the Idiotic letter.</p> <p>It's even more fun having a threesome with her and one of your male colleagues! It would just be a bit embarrassing if I were to fuck someone else, as you did your wife! I doubt that you would just get out of hand, if it did indeed occur. I had to get the opportunity. I'm looking forward to doing it with you.</p> <p>It was worth the risk. It's worth the chance. It was worth the chance. It was worth the chance and I was already making quite an impression on your wife!</p> <p>You have no idea of the consequences of the deed, don't you? Well, there is only one. Your wife is going to come home on time to see the Chief Justice of her country. And, there will be a lot of commiseration, and a lot of tears. And, maybe, a lot of sexual tension. And, I hope your wife is feeling a bit jealous. But, you don't have to worry about that, do you?</p> <p>It was worth it!</p> <p>In the end it was worth it; in the end it was worth the chance of fucking your wife. And, in the end, it was worth the chance of fucking hersâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
