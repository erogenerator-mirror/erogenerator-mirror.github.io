The pleasure of a man, for the first of many times, is that it is an equal opportunity occasion; that it is at least two months or three, to enjoy yourself; and, after making your own choice. This is what the two of you are really doing.</p> <p>"Oh boy, yes."</p> <p>"Mmmmmm."</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmm."</p> <p>"Aghhhhhhhh!" I felt that I had gotten close.</p> <p>"Are you sure? Because, as always, I'm sorry about this first time, but I really want us to do it again."</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm, I'm ready. I really am."</p> <p>"Good, because you're only going to learn," he looked me right in the eyes and, just as I felt his fingers start to rub my clit, I saw his cock twitching from the pleasure that was coursing through his body; from his face, and down through the sheet, to finally reaching me. "I would not be able to take you with that on your back," he said. He lifted my legs and pushed them back until they were just resting on his shoulders. He went down a little and put his cock in as far as it would go with its tip, while he was holding my pussy in the palm of his hand on top. I knew that he was going to fuck me. And I felt like I was going to explode. I was sure that with that cock, he could not have gone on forever or that I would cum soon, especially since he already had. But he started fucking me just a little, and I felt myself about to shoot again when he lifted me and carried me off the bed, and I saw that he was carrying me to the bathroom, with my hands above my head, while he gently put me on the shower floor. Then he opened the door of the toilet and pushed the seat so that he sat on it. He had a huge smile on his face. He wanted to take his time; like a baby; I was in heat; and I felt so happy, it made me feel like a woman in Heaven.</p> <p>"Let me take off your blindfold," he said. I nodded and we looked through the eyeholes and saw him.</p> <p>"I am so glad you would not do that," he said, and I knew it was the truth. I was about to tell him not to watch me again when one of those feelings started to get strong, right up there with the most powerful orgasm I had ever had. I didn't know it but I was about to have another. He pulled me against his body, and when we kissed, my mouth got into the act for him. He put his hand behind my neck, and he started to kiss me, as I was kissing him; the kiss that got stronger and more passionate, and when it broke, I felt that he had his tongue gently, teasingly, in my mouth. I was aching for more, and I felt that even through the fear of what I had let him do to me, that I was going to come again, sooner than I wanted. I let my body have its way with the kisses to the mouth and on to the neck and then again to the ear; until I had my orgasm and he had his. I felt him getting hard and I wanted to make him with me now. I put my legs over him, and I wanted to feel the full length of him inside of me before I came again. He bent down and put his cock against my pussy lips; and we both moaned at the wonderful, beautiful feeling that that first little, slow stroke felt, as he pushed himself inside me; so long. As he started fucking me, I felt him sliding his hands under my bottom, and I spread my legs farther and let him do whatever he wanted with me. We became just one being, with him taking me.</p> <p>"Oh!" I felt something, but I thought it to be you; something you had brought back from the depths of the ocean, and I still remember that feeling as I still hold you in my arms. And then I hear you say, "I'm yours." You were telling me that my husband had a cock, but it was you, because you had made me feel that way. You were making me feel, and I was feeling more of that. We took turns fucking each other, until we both started to feel a rush over both of our bodies.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum, again."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, please, now." I started moving like crazy, humping and thrusting as the bed with him, while I came, and came; and came, over and came. I found the sounds so very different than I did each other sounds that you made. I was the sounds.</p> <p></p> <p>"Yeahâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
