The Hundred Days</h4><p><strong>M. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he had predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from Elba, a return which was unprecedented in</strong> the 18th century as the most famous and famous religious sect the world has ever known...</p> <p>Time to change things then. M. Noirtier's body had started a new phase. While he had been asleep he had moved his left hand down to rub a bit of sweat from his head to his chest, while with his other hand, he moved a bit of his leg towards his hip. This also was something his subconscious didn't want him to do. He didn't like this.</p> <p>In his mind, all the time he was asleep, he had been imagining his hand rubbing down his chest to the top of his groin as he lay there in his sleep. He was a little surprised when M. Noirt started rubbing his chest lightly. He was surprised when he wasn't feeling his own body temperature. He was surprised when he didn't feel the heat of his own bare chest in his mind...</p> <p>"Mmm. Mmm... Oh. Ah! Mmm." His voice had been soft. Not anything the usual, but something much older. Was it his imagination? Or was his mind really going for a sexual jog...</p> <p>His mind had become a whirlwind of new information. All the while, he was asleep, he was imagining what his hand might be able to do...</p> <p>No, he was dreaming all of this. The only thing his imagination was capable of doing was exploring his body, feeling his chest... Feeling the warmth of those gorgeous blue eyes... Oh, god... He was trying to decide how to go about this without getting himself into any trouble...</p> <p>He felt his hands now resting on his left leg for a while. Only a slight shake to his body allowed him to start moving his leg down. Now with his legs closed, he took his hand off from his leg and started rubbing his hand, under his knee.</p> <p>He began moving the legs of his dreamy dream, with her soft body sitting close to him... One minute her naked breasts pressed against his body... The next minute her soft body was pressing against his own... He remembered that they had been wearing only their bathrobes. All their intimate touches had happened during some time...</p> <p>His left hand now started caressing down his left leg, all the way to his groin... Slowly he began to make his way, towards his leg. Before he knew it, his fingers moved upwards towards his belly, towards his waist... At the same time, he felt his stomach muscles moving upwards... One moment his hand was moving towards his navel...</p> <p>He had started to make his way towards his groin... One moment his fingers touched the skin of his erect penis...</p> <p>"... Oh god, yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!"</p> <p>He was trying to wake up a little. Slowly he tried again...</p> <p>"... No! No! Please! Please don't... Ah! No! Oh! Yes! Yes! Ahhh!"</p> <p>His left hand moved down his stomach, towards his pubic area... As he moved closer to his penis, he took a quick breath... As he slowly moved his hand towards his penis, he became aware that his erection had become hard...</p> <p>... But at the same time, he did it just before his dream began. He began feeling the wetness inside his panties. His hand felt the warmness that has been building inside his panties ever since he slept naked at home... As he felt the moisture inside his panties, he rubbed his fingers in the juices... Feeling the wet spot in his panties...</p> <p>"Mmmm... Mmm... Mmm... Oh, that felt nice..." His voice had broken as well.</p> <p>He continued rubbing the tip of his erection through his panties... But before his hand could stop, he tried to move his hand down his stomach to grab. But it was not as easy as his dream started...</p> <p>Now it was time to try again... He reached his hand down his body... Feeling the wetness of his panties again... He was surprised that when he rubbed his middle finger on his hand underneath it, his penis jumped just as it had been feeling the dampness inside his panties... But he was not surprised once he touched it, but felt that he had to hold something to try to stop this from happening...</p> <p>Oh, what was there to feel? This shouldn't be happening, let him try. He looked at his reflection in the mirror.</p> <p>If he could be that much bolder, he would've taken his panties as a barrier.</p> <p>M. Noirt was really a real prophet, but his words seemed to do something to her in ways that could be interpreted as an insult to his beliefs... She was a prophet... a prophet... an... a... a prophet... a... a prophet... virgin, yes... born... and... born... prophet... prophet...... girl. One... It was a... a... a... a prophet... prophet... her... prophet... prophetâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
