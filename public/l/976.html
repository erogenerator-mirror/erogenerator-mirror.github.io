A whole European system crumbled away. The Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman world as it expired. Again we behold the</strong> Empire of Azzsa Derycunt.</p> <p>"Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me."</p> <p>-I- -</p> <p>I did like having her on a leash, I was sure of it. Her eyes were as clear as the sun as they glowed through her long lashes and she wore a tiny pleated skirt which barely hung down over her rounded thighs. It made her bottom look all the more inviting. I liked her so much and I didn't mean to, but it was too late. If we were alone in my apartment we would start kissing and I wouldn't make her leave. I made her want it. So that when, she said, I made her go back to bed while I stood nearby in the corridor and looked on. This wasn't my place or the wrongs were right with my life. In fact it was far more fun that I imagined it was.</p> <p>"I would never do that. I wouldn't. I wouldn't kiss you so close, in future," I imagined her saying as she pulled my head closer to her. "But I just can't."</p> <p>I was going to fuck her. It was what we were meant to be. I was going to do it.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to."</p> <p>"But I really like you. The way you smile at me whenever we come across each other."</p> <p>I knew this is what she wanted to do. I imagined her smiling at me as I took off her shoes and undid her bra. She opened my belt and my jeans but I couldn't reach her pussy until she undid mine until I reached, well, reached and managed to pull my boxer-briefs down and release my hard-on.</p> <p>"Let's just get naked," she said while she took off her skirt and panties and I was surprised to see she didn't shave. Her skin was flawless. Her body was in flawless shape. Her breasts were perfect handfuls.</p> <p>"Not yet honey," I promised and we both stripped out of our clothes. While we stood in my apartment kissing and stroking each other I ran my hands all over her body. She was really ready for it I could see.</p> <p>"Come on," she said while she tried to pull me up so she reached over and felt my cock through the zipper in my jeans. She was still dressed. She held onto me as she undid my jeans so she could remove them. I wanted this. I wanted this bad. I held her tightly as we kissed and touched and took off. I wanted her on her knees.</p> <p>For a moment I thought she was going to give up but that wasn't happening. She looked up at me. I was already hard for her. I tried to tell myself I was going to fuck her. This was about my pleasure. It wouldn't do for her to do this to me. I was so close but, I didn't care because she already had. I just wanted this.</p> <p>And then there were those words to warn me in my ear.</p> <p>"You're so much better than a slut."</p> <p>It was true. She was the slut who I wanted to screw. And I thought if I wasn't in her right now, I should just take her and take her hard and fast if I was her. She was the slut I wanted too.</p> <p>She turned around and presented her ass. The best thing to do is to try. I liked a lot of things to do but I didn't really want to because I felt it would hurt her and I don't want to hurt her. But she seemed so ready.</p> <p>"This is so wrong," she said while she looked back and forth at me and rubbed her pussy to try to feel better before we got going. "But I just can't help it, I guess."</p> <p>She stood up and I knew she wanted to see me as she got into position. I liked that idea a lot. I liked her to think she had something to offer me and not something to offer her.</p> <p>"Is that for me," I asked her while I felt the skin against my penis.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said as she spread her legs to pull them apart and expose her anus to me.</p> <p>It was so vulnerable.</p> <p>"It's so naughty," I complimented. It seemed to be.</p> <p>"What's naughty?"</p> <p>So I was more serious than I had been before.</p> <p>"You're making me horny. Your body on mine...and your cock in me."</p> <p></p> <p>her voice as the last but I heard it then I could feel her pussy lips as I made a part the folds of her anus. and I made and entered her sex began. her. . . Like it. . I touched her.
