They were troubled and feverish hours, disturbed with dreams that were intangible, that eluded her, leaving only an impression upon her half-awakened senses of</strong> awareness, of touch of memory and sense of touch, of feel of desire and sexual heat. But she didn't care. She was happy. She'd just fucked someone. And then she was gone, she was gone again, away, through the world. She had lost her freedom to love, and she didn't care, in the extreme. "Hush." She murmured. "And just do it, honey. We'll go back to bed."</p> <p>He did just that. He slid his dick into her pussy, hard and hot, her slick skin tight around him as though her being could melt him. She gasped. "Good boy. You are so good at this, I never dreamed you could be good in bed."</p> <p>"I can be a good boy. I'll show you that in a moment, then you can fuck me as you like."</p> <p>"That sounds so good. But let's not be naughty."</p> <p>"Come closer, honey." She pulled on his shoulders and he obliged. She spread her legs and he took hold of his own dick, and rubbed his purple crown into her. It stretched her. "Huuuuhh," she gasped and pressed her knees. He pushed his dick into her, the slick heat of her wet pussy coating him, so hot she felt as though the skin was melting. His own dick pulsed in her, growing. She was full of his dick. "Faster," she begged. "You know you can cum on my pussy now. I love to feel you cum deep inside me. And I love to have it."</p> <p>"You're so tight, baby. Just like when you were a baby!" He thrust deeply into her, feeling that wonderful, wet, warm tightness, the sensation of a deep fuck. She gasped. "I love you," she said. "I love you. I fucking love you." She groaned, her eyes closed. It was so good. So good. He pulled away to give her time to become aware of his impending climax. She would not stop him. After all, her body was full of him. He would bring her off. And then he would fuck the living hell out of her.</p> <p>Her breath grew ragged as her eyes met his, tears falling onto his chest as she felt his dick inside her twitching and his hand squeezing her ass beneath her. She saw the rapture on his face, he knew what he was doing to her. Her eyes rolled back. He took her hands and positioned her so she was face down on the bed and straddled her. "Are you okay?" He murmured, kissing her neck. "I told you to be."</p> <p>"I'm fucking okay. Look at me," she hissed at him. God, he was so deep in her. "Do you know how much?" she said through her teeth, her mouth hanging open. He grinned. "That really means a lot."</p> <p>She felt herself go weak. He was in her. That felt so good. His dick filled her, and she knew it would never reach the bottom again. She was on her back, spread wide her hips up so he could plunge deep inside her. She was being bred. She belonged inside. And he belonged in her, his cock deep in her wetness. She could feel him stroking in her, rubbing against the soft wet walls of her pussy, in her own insides. There was no stopping him. They had just made love. They'd just come to fuck in the dark and she knew she would never see him again.</p> <p>"Yes," she croaked. "Yes! Yes!" She arched her back, her eyes shutting as her body tried to find something to do. "Fuck me."</p> <p>He fucked her long and good. Her eyes were closed, a dazed look on her face. "Is ... is it too much?" He kept fucking her.</p> <p>"Yes," she gasped, eyes popping open. "Yes, just there. It's enough, it's so good." She could feel his dick throb, even twitching inside her like a hot piston.</p> <p>He slowed down, and she felt him pulling out. Then he was on her again, his shaft sliding deep into her, pressing against her cervix, fucking her with such speed she felt like she was going to explode. But then she became aware of his hands under her, pinning her down, lifting her hips, sliding deeper into her wetness. "Hurry!" she hissed. "Do it, do it now. Now!" He pulled almost all the way out, holding the motion steady, his dick hard and ready, the swollen tip brushing the lips of her clitry labia, rubbing so wonderfully against her walls of her cunt where it was, his balls. He was going to cum in her, deep and pumping, he was going to cum in herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
