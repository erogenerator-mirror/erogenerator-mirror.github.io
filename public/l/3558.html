It seemed, at first, as if all that had happened</strong> during the past few hours had just been a dream...but not now...she thought of all the things that must have happened in their dream, and she wondered just what they would be...how would they be like? She was a virgin, as well as a good girl, and the girls' nightie and the other girls had been much like each other in their dreams, right down to the panties...and there'd been little chance that she and her friends could be that lucky, if they'd ever wake up...and there were also the other girls in her mind.</p> <p>She was a virgin, too, right down to the other girls in her mind, and at least now she knew that, somehow. It was only fair that she should know it too. But as she was in her room right now, she didn't know exactly what the other girls were thinking about her now. Or not thinking. But she knew that they were all going down on her, one after another now, and even when she stopped counting she knew that they'd definitely be doing something else to her.</p> <p>She watched in amazement as they all took off their clothes, one after another...and she felt oddly self-conscious about wearing nothing! And although she was still a virgin, she could still feel her breasts starting to ache from all the attention that was going on around her. She couldn't imagine how many girls her age were willing to do this for her, and at least now, it wasn't her fault that she'd been so sexually excited, before this.</p> <p>But then they were all doing it to her! One after another and still trying to figure out whatever they were doing to her, all of her fantasies she'd thought off somehow seemed a little more than this! Especially now as she stared at the three pairs of eyes that were all over her, all touching her body and caressing her, all of her body being touched at the same time, all five of them! There wasn't quite what happened in her dream. They were still all naked, except for a small t-shirt between their bodies! She was still dressed from the waist down, wearing panties underneath, and still watching the others do it to her.</p> <p>They all kept touching her...and it felt good. It made her feel better...she was feeling better than she'd felt since she was 16. She'd always been shy around girls but...she'd never been touched by another girl like this...not in the way she'd felt as a girl, anyway. But now they were all touching her, touching her, touching her with their hands, touching all the way inside her. Then it hit her, and she forgot all about all the other girls and felt excited by it all. The most exciting thing about it all was that it was her first ever sexual experience, right after all those wonderful dreams and the other girls...and she was not the same person as the rest of them were.</p> <p>All the other girls on the list were too young for this...she still didn't know that much about them. But she guessed that they'd all be really experienced, really horny, like any one of them before today. She guessed that she knew what she felt now...about herself...she guessed what she felt now about herself. What she felt about herself. Then one by one they were all going down on her, their tongue exploring her pussy and clitoris and mouth sucking on her sensitive pussy lips. She felt her clit hardening, and she squirmed underneath whoever was around her. Then she felt hands on her breast, feeling her nipples getting hard under their fingers, feeling the pressure in her tummy from it. So she was one of them now, in reality...but she wished it was a dream. She wondered just what those hands were doing, which were still on her, pressing her body down on them...if they could still feel each others breasts, their nipples pressing against their hands, and whether it was all over them that she was a virgin, and yet they were all on her too, touching her...almost touching her!</p> <p>Then she felt fingers on her anus. The fingers had to have touched something else! But there was nothing as she watched in her dream and she was helpless to stop them! So, whoever was working the fingers felt around in her ass for a while then, and started fingering it...and she didn't even flinch one bit! No little girl would do that for her, she thought! And so the finger went on its own...and suddenly she felt a finger up her butt hole! It was the tip of a finger that pushed through the puckered opening of her ass...and then it slid inside! And there was no protest! No resistance left it! It just accepted it. She became even!</p> <p></p> <p>and she felt herself there and now! And she felt as a finger inside her butt in her ass. and she felt everything on herself and she and herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
