I'd always had a secret longing for a man more than one of my boss's colleagues, and I wondered what it would be like to have sex with someone else. This was the dream that I'd promised Dr. Liveey that morning.</p> <p>It wouldn't have done any good, either. After my cock went in his ass that way, I probably would have come with an orgasm too. I really wouldn't have wanted to do it in someone's mouth or asshole. I had the only other experience ever to do that too—as Dr. Liveey's cock slid into my ass. It had taken only a little resistance to get him to actually slide in and out of my ass, though, and I hadn't come as hard as I did with the first time. I guess he knew I was a virgin, for his first time was as much fun as mine was.</p> <p>This night was about my new student. As my lover, I planned to give him pleasure in ways that he had never had. Dr. Liveey would be my boss, and I would be his boss. I wanted him to treat me like the sex robot that I was, just like the others in his office.</p> <p>"It's nice, baby," Dr. Liveey said.</p> <p>"Yes it is, Dr. Liveey," I said. "Your cock felt nice inside my ass."</p> <p>"You like having your boss's ass around your cock, don't you?"</p> <p>"I love having you inside my ass," I said, and then, with a little wiggle of his hips, added, "But it's better with a cock up there."</p> <p>"I would love you in my ass," he said. "I want your cock in my ass!"</p> <p>"I'd want to make you come," I said, "I want to see if you're able to stand the pleasure when you come. I want to keep sucking your cock while you fuck my pussy and come."</p> <p>"You're right," he said. "I'll take my cock in my hand and come on it."</p> <p>After I had already came twice, there wasn't much left for me to do but sit on his legs, and let him enter my ass. I could do that pretty easily enough, given that I was already in a position for the penetration that I wanted. I had to get up on my knees so I could use my elbows for leverage. This way, Dr. Liveey wasn't sitting on his legs and could sit on my ass as I straddled him, and I could thrust his cock between my lips and into my mouth and come there. I'd have a great time riding him that way.</p> <p>Dr. Liveey was also eager, though this time, because he didn't need Viagra for a good start, and I could come just as long as I got as hard as I needed to come. I was pretty sure that if I gave him a good start, I would get to swallow his come a lot.</p> <p>As I leaned down over his legs, just as I thought, Dr. Liveey pushed his pelvis into mine, and we shared another kiss, and then he said, "Are you ready to come, too?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said.</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>"Please don't hold back," I said. "Fill my ass up with your cock. Make me come."</p> <p>Dr. Liveey let out a groan, and I realized that I'd said what I'd hoped for. He was going to tell me when he was ready. I'd been dreaming of this coming to pass. I could wait and start my job as an eager young guy.</p> <p>"Come on," I said. "I do want it. Give me every inch of your cock again."</p> <p>As good as that sounded, I felt like it was just a fantasy. I'd never wanted a cock inside me, but it could never be something that it would really happen to me, that it would never really come to pass. Dr. Liveey was so fucking good; his groans didn't really hurt, but they did indicate where he was coming, and as soon as Dr. Liveey pushed into me as deeply as he could, I felt a rush of warm wetness as our bodies pressed together together and filled me—our mixed bodies and united—it was. I realized that I wanted to explode, and come, and come—I was coming, and come—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
