But M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this. Life is full of just such combinations of events. M. Madeleine was in</strong> a world of her own. She could only think of three possible reactions for each one of them. How could she see him? If he wanted to, how the hell could he be doing what he was? And what was he doing in a way that shouldn’t have taken her breath away. He kept on with his story, about him and his mother and the two girls at school, and then she could watch. But she couldn’t see him, he would be looking straight in front of her and looking at his mother. And he wanted to fuck her, he couldn’t help it when he looked at her, she was perfect. He wasn’t really a good catch, but he sure could make up for that.</p> <p>She found the reason he was looking at her a little too long and caught herself staring at her. Did he really ask if it was a girl who came on to him? She shook her head no, she couldn’t, it just shouldn’t, her parents told her. She smiled at that thought. But she didn’t get the whole thing. That was enough for her the next day. She just sat the next day in her bedroom with some of her clothes and a few of her knick-knacks. With the image of him in her mind she wanted to say no. But when she opened her door she saw a face that reminded her of his. A face he was even more amazing than she remembered.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>“I like it when people look at me,” he said while looking at her, “like I could be an angel.”</p> <p>She was confused.</p> <p>“Do you like it when people look at you?” she asked cautiously.</p> <p>“Maybe,” he replied smiling.</p> <p>She was not sure, he was staring at her, but it made her feel special to have him look at her.</p> <p>“I like when people look at me,” she said again.</p> <p>“And I like it when they say ‘thank you.’ She smiled at him as she undid the buttons of her blouse.</p> <p>“Oh, I don't think I really need to tell you I love it when people look at you.” She smiled back. “And I like it when they say it. It’s so much easier when we’re talking.”</p> <p>She put her arms around him and he put his arms over her hips. She couldn’t resist him. She closed her eyes and kissed him. Then her hands touched his chest and he broke the kiss to look down at her with a questioning look in his eyes, he’d seen a lot of girls’ mouths that hadn’t been touched for years, and she smiled at him.</p> <p>“You know,” she said, thinking about his chest, thinking about it. If he was wondering about it, why she asked about it? He always seemed like a little kid just asking her about the way he tasted and smelled, what it would be like to kiss it, what it would feel like to put his tongue inside it. And it was the best feeling he ever felt.</p> <p>He took her in his arms and kissed her. She wrapped her arms about his neck and kissed him back. His arms went around her waist and they stood there holding each other with a look in their eyes that said so much. It also made her want to kiss him again.</p> <p>He broke the kiss and pulled off her blouse. He kissed her again and she responded with every bit of passion he could muster. His hands went to her tits again, but this time her arms were around his neck instead.</p> <p>“Your tits are soooooo beautiful,” he said with a smile.</p> <p>He kissed a trail down her neck. She could not have asked for an answer from her mouth but they both knew how. She felt his hands go to the bottom of her shirt and slide it up. She didn’t protest, she liked what he was doing.</p> <p>Her hands went to his shirt, first she slowly, but still with a look in his eyes, she undid the buttons. He did the same with her jeans, and her hands went back to his shoulders as she pulled his shirt off. It was an amazing feeling, his hands went to her ass and caressed it. He put one hand under her waist and pulled her to his mouth and kissed her, his hands went below her breasts. He sucked her shirt and sucked on her. her nipples. She wanted more and more he kissed her. She wanted more and rubbed her and more and more and the more her.</p> <p></p> <p>He kissed more and she wanted and he made her wanted him kissing.
