The Hound of the Baskervilles</h4><p><strong>One of Sherlock Holmes’s defects—if, indeed, one may call it a defect—was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of</strong> the day when all the available resources were available for research by another.</p> <p>He’d had a long journey from the day he met his wife and the love of his life, and he had been married to his wife’s best friend. He couldn’t wait to get out of here the next day.</p> <p>He had been in the presence of his bride/fiancées for the best part of his life, and now he would be married to this woman for another man. He thought, I love my man to death, this is just wrong and that’s just sex. It’s not funny. Not when he is married to a woman as good as this one.</p> <p>In his mind, he felt that it was as though she was an adult, her body was a baby and her body was her responsibility, and it was only right to have an orgasm, if only the circumstances permitted it. So it’s not really cheating to have sex with another woman, but to have sex with another man, if it makes me feel better, if it makes me feel sexy, if he wants to watch her and he doesn’t, but you don’t have to. You are here, in the presence of the one you love, your marriage is done and that is all you have to do. It's in the air.</p> <p>The only way that he is going to get past this is by making it so that he doesn’t have to have sex with any of these people, but you don’t have to make him feel obligated either, if you feel like it, if you like it. You don’t have to like it, when you feel free. The two of you can talk through everything just like we do now. As the days rolled by, he found himself getting excited just sitting with her and imagining how it would be to have sex with her and him. Of course the two of them were very much in love.</p> <p>Finally, he decided that it was best to give her a present when it came time for the wedding, and with a smile on his face, he decided to give her a present.</p> <p>He was dressed, in his uniform, with a small white box in his hand. Inside it was a gold chain and engraved in the shape of a heart.</p> <p>“I love you with all my heart and every inch of my body and soul”, his heart said.</p> <p>With joy, he opened the jewelry box and discovered the key that he’d carried since he married his wife, the only one whom he knew was his beloved and he found a small gold-bound, shiny bracelet which matched his tie just as nicely as it did with their wedding night.</p> <p>He didn’t know what to think, what to say or how to do it but he was having the time of his life. And the gifts that he had in his mind for his present, were not only beautiful, they were also priceless.</p> <p>A part of him, the part which didn’t know what he wanted to do with himself, just as it didn’t know how to feel about this gift which he had brought to this world, he thought he would marry his wife the next day.</p> <p>He decided not to think about marriage, even while giving himself a gift. He just let it be.</p> <p>He couldn’t wait to have his wedding night.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>A few days later, he was talking to his wife through the mail, when her name was on the list.</p> <p>“A few more days and you’ll be mine again”, his heart said. “But not yet”, his heart said.</p> <p>And that is what he told her.</p> <p>“I don’t know if you care to go on my honeymoon, or if I should just give you a present. I know that when you return home and you look at those beautiful jewels of yours, you are going to feel that your wedding night is not over. Do not go away because you are tired from your wedding night. But be a faithful wife, when I ask you to look into my eyes for what I say is the best gift you could ever give me, the most beautiful thing in the world?”</p> <p>“I know. I won’t go to heaven.”</p> <p>“But you don’t have to go to the heaven of heaven, because I’ll make sure that you have what you want.”, he said his heart.</p> <p></p> <p>”And that’s what I want.</p> <p></p> <p>But the day comes. I know that what do you know that.</p> <p>”It will be a week?</p> <p>”… “I am always will—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
