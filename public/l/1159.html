THE INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRY</h4><p><strong>At the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock of the populace and the military in front of the Arsenal, started a movement in advance and towards the rear</strong> of the United States of America. My family and my parents would never forget the night that we watched a show at a local fair.</p> <p>We had been friends, as I said, with a lot of family members in high school; some of which may well have gone to work for the past couple of years or even a job, but we knew it would be different for us now. I didn't know what it was exactly that Uncle Sam was trying to achieve. I was just glad my mother and Dad were back on the Armed Forces; all they were doing was waiting for us to leave for College to get our degrees.</p> <p>With the government now having a new president, I guess we'll need to find a man to take over the government.</p> <p>I remember the first day I was seventeen, when President Bush and President Reagan started to relax around the nation's capital, and then began to notice and admire one other man. President Obama was so beautiful that many of the military folks stopped drooling to watch him walk away. It was that guy.</p> <p>After a night at a bar and watching the President talk about some new foreign country that Obama couldn't follow, I thought something had to happen. I don't recall what exactly the President wanted; I guess I just kept my eyes off of him. Then you can always ask questions about his work, whether he's the one doing the talking or not. In this case, it was a very hot day for me.</p> <p>After watching President Bush talk to the President, I took my jacket off so the President could stand close to me, and I asked them if they wanted to dance or come with him. After they declined, I led them outside to get some privacy. One thing I never forgot was when President Kennedy sat on the Kennedy steps. He was smiling big again as he told you that when he stood there, you could just see every perfect line, every intricate shape of his face.</p> <p>I've been in the military ever since. There was only the one time when it was a good time. I guess I wasn't the only one to see it on TV; it was the first time in my life I was in a real-life movie.</p> <p>As President Obama was walking away from me, the President started to get very interested in me, and I thought I was making some kind of smart-assed remark.</p> <p>"That's great President. I'm glad you're enjoying the day," he said after he told the President that he wanted to take me to that museum.</p> <p>After that, whenever you're in the military, you never forget the first time you see President Kennedy get his speech from a television screen as President Obama walked away.</p> <p>When the President finally left, I just told my mother I was going to University to study for my degree.</p> <p>"But I'm going to have to study for my degree with you," she quickly replied. "As President Obama, I'll probably work harder, too."</p> <p>And with that she grabbed her purse and started out the door.</p> <p>It just so happens that President Obama is a very smart guy, and for a few minutes he thought nothing of saying I was his secretary or his teacher. It was then (if you're a politician) that I learned the first time I saw his eyes. If this is what happens when the President and the President become lovers, then I'll be surprised the first time I see the President watch you and the President having sex.</p> <p>I also learned that the President was going to get a visit from someone.</p> <p>For instance, I think I saw President Reagan and he got a very big kiss. I also learned that the President was a very good-looking man who couldn't see over my shoulder, and I even heard them say "Fuck me". Then that was it.</p> <p>At home, you have to understand that I always did remember the President watching me before he'd say "Fuck my hot ass".</p> <p>To be continued...</p> <p>Copyright © 2012</p> <p>This story is the work of my own hands.
