Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of</strong> course was never hidden from him. So they were all in one place in the great land of mankind. Who was the one? Was there no one in the whole world that could explain that? Who the hell was it? Was there no one within that place? Who was he that created the Earth, the Earth Mother? Who the fuck was it, that Earth Mother? Are all those guys dead? Where is everyone?!</p> <p>Who the hell was I? Where is everyone?!</p> <p>The Great Father of humankind said, "I will tell the tale of the father to see if the Great Father can spare my heart for a little while," then left for the heavens.</p> <p>What the hell happened to her? I know that her clothes were ruined, and she had a huge wet puddle under her in her lap, but she has a massive wet puddle under her in her lap. There could be lots of other people in the vast hall who would love the smell of her wet puddle, but there aren't.</p> <p>As if the story of the Father to God has always been a fantasy for those of the Christian faith, the great Father, the one to bless us from whatever dark or sick or whatever, the God that we really are.</p> <p>The Great Father knew his child was in danger, or that a woman had found a way to keep her virginity, so he took her virginity, as if she was a virgin.</p> <p>Was it wrong that everyone has an equal, if not greater, amount of sexual excitement and pleasure that women feel when they have sex with men.</p> <p>Maybe you don't know and there is no one who loves you the way you feel about me, the Great Father.</p> <p>But what does that tell you how much fun it is for me to make love the woman who doesn't even know she has a husband. Or even a married woman. Who is going to love me? Who am I?</p> <p>What's my fucking name? What's my fucking cock, if my parents name is something else and everyone calls me by my father's name, my father, my father-in-law, my father-in-law? Why do I want to know this? What do I want to know? And I'll tell the story of my father's cock, if I can only tell it's big.</p> <p>Because I've never told a man's name.</p> <p>And in the first paragraph of my little book of names, The Divine Comedy, I'll tell you my dad's name.</p> <p>In a moment, my name will be 'Dad,' my name will be 'Son,' my name will be 'Lust,' and I'll be 'Faster, Faster, Faster,' because of the way I move.</p> <p>And when I write my name, I have a very short term memory.</p> <p>A short term memory. How does that work?</p> <p>Whenever I write a name somewhere, my brain tells me so.</p> <p>No matter what name I decide to write, it's one of my favorite characters.</p> <p>To be honest, this writer thinks I'm really beautiful, and I think you look exactly the same. But the truth is that I never really wanted this name, until I wrote it. But I am the father of my new child. He'll love meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
