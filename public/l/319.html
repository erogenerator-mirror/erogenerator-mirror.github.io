It is now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour</strong>. That will be the start of a very interesting and enjoyable day. If you are not quite certain about any of this, or if you are still married to Mr. Moore, I advise you to say so. We shall start off with a short video interview. The interview will begin at 10 o’clock. Then we move from the classroom to our classroom. This will be a two hour segment.” I said. (Yes, we’re going to have some very interesting stories to work out.)</p> <p>“Do you want an appointment?” asked Dr. Moore.</p> <p>“Absolutely!” I replied.</p> <p>Dr. Moore went on.</p> <p>“I am now going to take my clothes off. Let’s go to the bathroom.” I said.</p> <p>With this, Dr. Moore walked out of the classroom, leaving the door open. He quickly undressed. He was tall and slender, his legs tanned and muscular, his chest firm and his hardening manhood hard and swollen. He looked very sexy.</p> <p>I stood in the bathroom, my robe at my waist, as I watched the scene unfold in front of me.</p> <p>“Mr. Moore, I really like your performance. I was wondering if we could take the Professor out to lunch tonight?” asked the Professor.</p> <p>“Sure thing, Professor. I’ll go check.” I replied.</p> <p>I closed the bathroom door and walked inside, shutting the door behind me. I noticed as Dr. Moore looked in the mirror to watch that he had some gray hairs on the back of his head. He didn't have much pubic hair, in fact, he was completely shaven with short, curly hair just over where his ear was.</p> <p>I took off my robe, which only left me in my panties and sandals. I stepped in front of the mirror to examine myself, my nipples were hard and poked straight through my panties. My pussy lips were glistening in light pink.</p> <p>I was so intent at what I was doing, I didn't think that it’s a good idea to go without underwear.</p> <p>I stood at the sink, my hands by my side, as the Professor’s eyes explored my body. He looked down at my nakedness and stared at my very pink clit, my lips, my nipples that were hard and extended even more than they already were.</p> <p>I looked his body up and down, taking in the features of his chest. His face was smooth and tan in the candle light, his body a bit like a marble statue. He had large, dark eyes and thick, dark mustache.</p> <p>“Can’t you do a nude in front of us, with only a robe?” asked Dr. Moore.</p> <p>“Oh, yes, that’s okay. Do it, please.” I replied.</p> <p>“Do you like the sight of my body, Mrs. Moore?” asked the Professor.</p> <p>I looked him directly in the eyes from the floor to the mirror behind me and smiled. My face turned from slight embarrassment.</p> <p>And I liked the way he said, Mrs. Moore. Mrs. Moore, you are going to fuck and suck every cock in the building without any clothes under your bathrobe.</p> <p>I started walking towards Professor Moore, my bare hips. My nipples were hard and pointed straight away from my body, not as straight as when I was standing in front of him. I looked at the Professor intently, my expression neutral, a little nervous.</p> <p>“That’s good, Mrs. Moore.” said Dr. Moore,” You’re doing very well, Mrs. Moore. This is very good. You have been watching Mr. Moore’s performance as much as I have been watching it before. I can be quite clear when I say that. Now go out to the bathroom.”</p> <p>I slowly walked towards the Professor. I stopped just short of him. My face was level with his crotch. I looked down at his cock, now hard and pointing straight up towards the ceiling, with his dark pubic hair, and his dick pointing down at the ceiling and all at the front of his body. I was totally fascinated.</p> <p>I looked up at him for a second to make a long, long, straight line of drooping head from my chin to his navel, over his crotch, down all the way to his thighs and crotch, and back down to the floor and finally to his dick.</p> <p>I can see his dick starting to get hard and pulsating, his chest again. I couldn”, pointing to the sky and pointed straight down towards me. “ from the floor, the ceiling. I can feel its pointing down the direction of my head—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
