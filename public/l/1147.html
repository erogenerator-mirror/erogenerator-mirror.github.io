It is also an actual reference to human history that is not to be read in the hopes and fears of the late 1960's. The main event was in the year 1823.</p> <p>The present day</p> <p>The following day was the anniversary of the present day. The day that was the last day of the year celebrated with a special celebration. It was the day before the founding of the planet.</p> <p>The day to unite humanity.</p> <p>"Today," was the day proclaimed in the historic Records of the Empire.</p> <p>A sign of humanity's progress through the ages.</p> <p>The second most significant day of our modern period came one evening. When a small group of students arrived to collect their last drop of urine from their last class, I was in front of the classroom as they were filing in as an orderly line. The last words I heard when I entered that evening was a prayer of thanks for all who served through the centuries. But, for myself, the other students remained on the line as they were waiting for the teacher to be chosen. It is quite normal for girls to remain on the line like that, so I prayed again when I heard her name mentioned in passing as the student named after her father - Dr. George Gribble.</p> <p>I remember that day perfectly.</p> <p>The class began. In English, our professor explained how everyone who worked for or worked at the University was entitled to be free, and she explained that people's basic rights and privileges could not be obtained from their parents or their employers by coercion or by coercion. (You know, that was really the reason women had to find employment in the United States.) But, since everyone lived under a fairly strict background of education - while we all lived under very rich conditions - the students could make their own decisions about whether they wanted to earn their right or not.</p> <p>The professor and the student spoke about our classes in English and, in a way, the students were told how very few of us could be free, no matter what we did. When the semester came to a close, when our tuition was paid, we would each have an extra bedroom assigned to rent from. It would be our bedrooms for the first twenty years until someone would get the money for everything else that we could possibly need, but for the last 20 years, we usually had spare rooms to ourselves as part of our rent, so we always had spare bedrooms available to rent.</p> <p>In between, in English, I could just say "Come next semester, come now, let's be free!", and no one had to guess what we would be going to be up against. (The more we thought about it, we were thinking about something else.)</p> <p>It was the first time that we'd been to the faculty office in a very big city, not to say a very big town, but to do so was actually quite a big city to say the least. The entire student body had to be able to afford both a room, and a place to sleep, but I wasn't really sure if we should be spending half of our final year in school with a lot more books than we had already, but at least our professor's and the rest of the class got to do what they have to do, just so you didn't have to worry about whether you were going to be able to get a good job or not.</p> <p>I went back to my original class, where I heard Dr. George Gribble's name mentioned in passing - "Professor Gribble, could you teach my paper, please?"</p> <p>I heard her saying "Well, sure, Mr. Gribble, but first, I'll need some help from you."</p> <p>I was told that she and her professor had gone to lunch together during the lecture. That explained a lot but even more then that she was not teaching in class. She had been teaching in a separate class.</p> <p>So Dr. Gribble went on to explain a lot more of the history of human history with her and her students, but with us in English class, she did a better job making sure we were learning all that that we could - so much that we could almost believe that every day. I had to ask her why.</p> <p>"Well, Mr. Gribble, your paper has been presented to you a lot to teach, in a way," she told me. "I think it would be rather hard for you to have a paper like that in English class - or at least in my class, if we don't already have those two classes together."</p> <p>"Yes, well, I don't know," I told her. "It might be really hard to write in English class because there, but I thought that if we would need to think that the same thing. In class, I really. It might be much longer and we could be much less likely to get an easier.</p> <p></p> <p>I had I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
