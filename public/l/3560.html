A moment later, she had to fight for breath, and once again was able to do the first thing she would do ever.</p> <p>I hope that she doesn't feel as guilty as I did about what I got myself into.</p> <p>'Aww oh, so very much,' Mom scolded him.</p> <p>'Sorry too,' he apologized. 'I guess I didn't want to embarrass you.'</p> <p>'That's not all,' Mom insisted. 'I guess you did see that.'</p> <p>'Is that what's so funny?'</p> <p>'Not so much.'</p> <p>'What'd you see?'</p> <p>'Nothing.'</p> <p>'Something like that.'</p> <p>'Really?'</p> <p>"I did see how hot those breasts are, how your hair is falling down your shoulder.' I said boldly, even though I had already said something equally outrageous. 'I didn't forget my own mom.'</p> <p>'What about your old-fashioned ways, dear boy?'</p> <p>'Not so long as those little tits aren't falling allover my big ol' chest right now.'</p> <p>'Oh, God,' Mom lamented. 'I can't believe I even said those things, not in front of everyone.'</p> <p>'Sorry to disappoint you.'</p> <p>'You're welcome,' Mom assured him. 'What do you think your breasts look like?'</p> <p>'Not bad, and so much more beautiful,' he said. 'Are those really sexy?'</p> <p>'Yeah they're kinda good looking.'</p> <p>I hope there's something sexy in this conversation that's not going to be the end of it. But I have another idea. 'So when I say, 'Your parents' are going to be seeing them, are you sure you want to go through with this?'</p> <p>'No,' Mom said. 'They'll only see us having sex. In fact, the whole time they were at that gym, they're going to be thinking we're having a lesbian or even a bi sex party. Then they'll get excited.'</p> <p>'Is that what you two are like?'</p> <p>'Oh no way.'</p> <p>'Why not?'</p> <p>'Because your parents are always having lesbian or bi sex parties,' I countered. 'Besides, they look so much alike that I wouldn't even know they were mother and son.'</p> <p>'Well, let's put it this way. I have always loved a mother and son relationship. And I don't care if you and Dad fuck, or how you fuck your mother,' Mom went on, 'but I'm willing to do this for you. I'm willing to do everything in my power to make it happen.' With nothing pressing me against the wall like mine was, my cock seemed to have a mind of its own, and it began to grow.</p> <p>'I don't see how it'll be anything to worry about,' Mom said softly.</p> <p>'It's all good,' I said. 'Do you want to take me downstairs, or do you want to walk me down to your parents and ask for a date where you can have my first pussy?'</p> <p>'I just want to get you dressed up, make love to you, and take care of you, whatever else you want,' Mom said.</p> <p>'You already have my virginity, and I want to make love to you so we can make each other happy,' I added.</p> <p>'What's wrong with me anyway?' Mom asked curiously.</p> <p>'Nothing,' I assured her. 'Just a little thrill.'</p> <p>'Then you had better do it quickly.'</p> <p>'You want to help your little boy,' I reminded her. 'And you also know better than to let him get a little lost in the world of woman.'</p> <p>"What was that about?' Mom whispered huskily, and then her eyes widened as they met mine.</p> <p>'I meant that I'd just give him one little kiss,' I told her. 'And I'm sure he would have enjoyed that, much more than you would. So, why don't I show you just how much I want to kiss you and be kissed by you, if I'm not too quick.'</p> <p>'No, it's OK,' Mom said, even as her words still sounded like a dream. 'It's just that the way we are together makes it really hard to want something like this, especially when there's something you can't even give me.'</p> <p>'Then just kiss me and be sure you want me to be with you when our first time comes,' I said, and added. 'And besides, I'll tell you when we get to make it so it lasts really good.' good for us.' I want to be happy for us.' good for us good for us to really good for ourselves each otherâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
