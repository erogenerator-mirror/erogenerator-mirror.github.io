With a sense of destiny, Pierre, his husband, and his best friend in the world was enjoying a very warm summer day and wanted the best for them.</p> <p>And so, as they continued their "dinner", they enjoyed great intimacy, their favorite meal, and many more other pleasures together.</p> <p>On their third night together, during their short weekend at the Belgrade-Nautilus-Schnemker Klub (the Swedish Olympic weightlifting team) in Moscow, they enjoyed a pleasant night together, both of them enjoying great sex.</p> <p>They exchanged numbers and wrote to each other on their way to Moscow and began a correspondence that brought them together. They shared their lives and their hopes for the future in a similar way.</p> <p>They agreed to meet together on Friday night. The days away from each other at the Olympic trials were the most he had ever experienced in his life. Pierre was a very shy boy and hadn't really wanted to go to a swimming tournament.</p> <p>As was also true in his home country, he had met a very attractive Russian beauty, but there were times when he dreaded having sex with a stranger. He could feel his dick hardening inside his pants, his mind working as if it was trying to calculate the time difference between the two of them.</p> <p>They ended up in bed, both exhausted but happy. In fact, they had an especially happy day together, kissing, touching, tasting, touching, having incredible sex, all day and night.</p> <p>In their hotel room, the sex between them had just begun. Pierre and his friend were on the bed, exploring each other's bodies, slowly making love with each other, exploring the other's sexuality. They moved faster and deeper, harder and deeper, until they were both moaning with intense pleasure.</p> <p>While they did, Pierre moved his face down to his wife's breast, licking and sucking her large nipples until he felt her breasts grow to twice their previous size. His tongue moved up to her breasts and he began sucking and chewing on them, making them even bigger and harder.</p> <p>"Ohh, Pierre," she moaned. "I love you so much. I have never felt this way."</p> <p>While lying, Pierre continued sucking her breasts. And he began doing the same with her nipples and they began their rhythmic motion together, building to a mutual climax.</p> <p>"Oh, God," Janet gasped. "Fuck me with your big cock."</p> <p>They continued to make out, her thighs pressed up against his crotch.</p> <p>"Oh God," she screamed, as her climax started. She pressed hard against him and began pumping her pussy furiously against him.</p> <p>His hands were on her shoulders, pinning her to the bed. He was in full intercourse with her and they were cumming together. This was not what he had thought, his first time, nor the first time having sex with a foreign woman. He loved his wife with all his heart and only hoped there would be another time.</p> <p>For now, they continued on the bed, Pierre's face between his wife's legs, kissing her everywhere, while her husband, the Olympic weight lifting coach, lay on his back. For another night, they spent the time together in an embrace, kissing, making love, making love.</p> <p>But then, for a second or two, she stopped. He felt her move and lay on the bed beside him. One of her hands was still on her husband's face. In silence, his wife stroked his cheek and lips.</p> <p>"God. Yes," he murmured, between kisses. "This time is wonderful."</p> <p>"Mmmm. This time will be even better," she replied. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you, too," Pierre replied.</p> <p>Both of them drifted off to sleep, content with their love for each other.</p> <p>The following day, the following morning became day three in the relationship, two men made love to their wife and the other went at their own pace. The night before a day together filled with love and kisses and touches became morning.</p> <p>"I'm going down to my office," Pierre said. "The morning will be free. Let's go."</p> <p>As Pierre walked toward his office, he couldn't help admiring his long and shapely legs, the tight muscular thighs and the incredible ass that he had just seen.</p> <p>With a big smile and a little of the sexual excitement of the previous day, Pierre was pleased with the way things were going. He was also surprised to find himself completely at ease with him and his friends, just like a couple. His English wife, he had a friend-for the whole world. Alluna, with an American friends.</p> <p></p> <p>Pierre smiled-for Pierre was his husband, he had always in the greatest and the most of all others on—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
