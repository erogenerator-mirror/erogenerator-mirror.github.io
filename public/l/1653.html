I thought I should find you in bed,” said her husband, when he discovered her lying there. He had walked up with Madame</strong>’s dildo in his hands and was giving it back to her on the sideboard. For the life of her she had not recognized that dildo. “The girls are looking for you,” said her husband to Madame.</p> <p>Madame was not really a doting husband. She was a doting whore and liked to be treated like one. She had told her husband that she felt like she needed to fuck around, but that was only the beginning. This was not something she had ever experienced before. She wanted the same things that he had wanted. She wondered if she would be able to bring them together. In fact, she was sure that she would not need her doting husband, after all, she had never done this before. But that was why she wanted to do this now, not as a cheap toy.</p> <p>She lay up in bed, as far away from her husband as possible. She opened her eyes as the dildo was starting to work it’s magic on her horny pussy. She thought back to her dreams of men making love to her as she slept.</p> <p>She wondered what other men did to her, and if the dildo would feel good in her asshole. In her mind, at least. With her husband, she doubted if her legs were aching any more. She wondered if it were a matter of the dildo being a cock and not a cunt. She also wondered if the vibrating cock of her husband was a cock and not a cunt. If it was, why did it feel like she had to make love with it if it was not a dildo? She decided to try it, though. She imagined her husband’s cock pushing out her body, her hips and her legs. She imagined that she would be so stretched, with cock and all of that. Then it began to hurt. The pleasure of the cock did not feel good. But in her eyes, it felt as good as when the dildo had just been inside her. The pressure of the cock was beginning to feel good, too. It seemed strange that so many sensations were going to be involved.</p> <p>“What would you do if I were to fuck myself while your dildo was doing this?” she asked her mind. She envisioned her own husband’s cock being pushed into her cunt. She imagined her husband's dick being pushed into her ass while it drove into her mouth and pussy. She felt the dildo working against her clitoris and between her legs. The dildo began to feel like it was being pushed into her anus, not one finger. It began to feel more real. It began to feel real. The dildo had started to be really moving against her clitoris. Her husband was doing this. She just hoped that she could give herself an orgasm that was not as bad as in her dreams and dreams. She had never imagined that this would ever happen to her.</p> <p>Her husband just sat down on the bed, his cock standing at attention. He could wait no longer. He began to masturbate himself, which seemed to increase the pleasure the dildo felt as it was moving against her cunt. She was just about to reach her orgasm when she felt something press against her cunt and then it stopped. She looked down to see her dildo pressed against her clitoris. There is nothing in her mind that says that this is happening. There was no reason not to just try. She closed her eyes and put on a happy face. Then she remembered her husband was in the room with her and how her body wanted to climax.</p> <p>Before she knew it, her first orgasm started. She closed her eyes and remembered the first time all those wonderful sensations started, even when she had dildo pressed against her clit. She closed her eyes as her first orgasm reached its peak. When it began, it seemed to last forever in her mind. The dildo began to pulse and move against her clitoris. She felt wonderful after the second orgasm. If there was anything in this world that had never happened before, it wasn’t the dildo, not really. She had never felt the feelings that she had experienced as a husband fucking his wife while his cock was inside her cunt. She knew she had never felt the wonderful sensations her body had been having while she gave herself the pleasure that her dildo was giving her.</p> <p>When her orgasm began to slow, her husband began to thrust it inside her pussy. When the next orgasm began, it felt as if she had been fucked in her cunt, with her dildo against her clit while her husband thrust it deep into her cunt.</p> <p>“That was wonderful,” she breathed. “ I need more of that. And I want the next time.’s do you next.”</p> <p>She imagined it was what she did not quite the next time.< She was when she was not about to want to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
