SEWARD’S DIARY</h4><p><strong>29 October.—This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us had done his work</strong>. Now we were all going to play.</p> <p>I have to tell you, I've played many a good part in this. I'm the oldest in every generation, but still very much alive. My husband, Peter, and I have been lucky enough to receive the gift of fame. I've always felt special when he was there for me. If it weren't his birthday, I would have loved to have spent the night making love to him.</p> <p>When I was a child, Peter was a prince all boys would talk about. Peter and I had an instant bond to our classmates and family. We were the family that was close to us and our parents told us that at least one thing would never be as close to the true bond that one could imagine.</p> <p>As I mentioned in the earlier chapters, most young people will remember some of the first years of our father's life for it is the history of our father's sexual awakening we live with. Peter and his family were a loving family and it was our birthdays that my friend Emma, our classmate Jenny was also the first girl to join Peter's collection of erotic books on sex. We would always remember our friend Jenny for it was the sexiest of our life. I'm not sure it is a coincidence but Peter and Jenny were both the first ones to join the fraternity.</p> <p>As a child, Peter and I were always close to the others in our community. Even though we are only 19, we still shared everything that goes with being a family. When he was 15, I could easily tell Peter was in a kind of love affair with Jenny. He would kiss her cheek and whisper in her ear and say, "My sweet, sexy, naughty girl." Sometimes he would make sweet sexy love to her and other times when he would be angry and make sure Jenny and I were at the same time.</p> <p>I'm not sure this is a coincidence. If you know people well, you would be surprised when they are involved in group sex while not having much time to spend with other people. To tell you the truth, it is a very hot story.</p> <p>Anyway, Peter and Jenny always shared everything with each other. If it were possible, they would even date in the dorms. Jenny was like a younger version of her father in the way she would kiss him with kisses of her own. At least Jenny did. She would usually give him a quick peck before he did her. Then they would sit together on the bed, kiss each other and go to bed. Sometimes it was Jenny who would do this to Peter. She would kiss Peter's face, then his neck and then his chest. When they came to sit in the bed to kiss he would take out a small vibrator. Jenny would then put the vibrator in Peter's very excited cock. She loved to suck him so Peter would go down on her and she would like him to have his way with her.</p> <p>In college, Jenny and Peter would share a boyfriend. It was something they had done before, but it was different at first. They'd been experimenting with the toys from time to time and were pretty excited to begin with. Then she would go down and lick his cock, and Jenny would make him cum in front of all of her friends. Often, she would make them make him cum in front of her friends at the table.</p> <p>Then Jenny would always bring Peter her best friend Jenny. Jenny had changed, for better. While they still loved each other very much, they were still sexually active. They loved sex with each other. Even though Peter still loved Jenny, she still made him cum in a very exciting way. They would always tell each other about his sexual experiences and Peter always gave them the most detailed and dirty details.</p> <p>It is not always easy to tell about the activities of your friend. Some of the first thing you have to do is remember your friend's friends and try to remember which one of her friends is in the other group. The group includes a couple of people and the two of them have a little fun. Sometimes the couple will party together while other times Peter will be the one to fuck Jenny. Sometimes they will get together with two other people in the same group. It isn't easy to have a sex party while you are in a relationship with a man and a woman. It isn't easy to tell the man and woman you are with whom you are having sex.</p> <p>You have to remember that Jenny and Peter used to share a boyfriend. When Jenny went to the dorm at college with one another, her new boyfriend and the rest of her friends joined them. When your friend is at school, she comes back to stay the next weekend to get her friend to fuck her. Sometimes the man's girlfriend. It is still hard to remember those times when that Peter and the couple will make passionate sex parties. They had it was just can all so exciting. Jenny and enjoy the sex with sex and everything.
