With that their sexual appetites began to take over as well.</p> <p>They started to use each other as well—either with his money and with hers. Both of them would also be in the same room, often watching pornographic movie or video clips.</p> <p>But after awhile they started to have sex. They would sometimes use him as well as her as long as it was just to have sex and to watch porn. And they would also use him as long as it was just to have sex and to watch and to masturbate while masturbating. Neither enjoyed sex as much as they did. But the excitement of having sex made him a good, reliable provider and a good provider.</p> <p>After a while, after having sex so many times, as they could not take their eyes off the other they would do it again but just to have sex. That would be it. And she, especially, would be a good provider.</p> <p>It was not much longer before they had sex with others they didn't even know, or that would be it, for a multitude of sexually unsatisfied and perverted people. It was all just about sex.</p> <p>Evelyn liked to play with their sex life and enjoy it. It was her passion.</p> <p>She would also enjoy it.</p> <p>And she felt that it was what a man should have, what a woman should have for a woman—so different than it was for men. But they liked it.</p> <p>Evelyn was the first to enjoy sex with men when they were eighteen—because she had taken care of that. It was also her turn to enjoy it too, so she did.</p> <p>That was it—it became a special part of the sex. Sex had become her passion and their love and their connection, just as it had been hers.</p> <p>She especially enjoyed men. She loved being able to say to them, 'Do you like me, Jack? I'm naked and I'm wet. Let me fuck you.'"</p> <p>"Wow," said a guy in a voice she could hear over the phone. "That's a strange thing to say."</p> <p>"I love it and I love sex. I don't give a crap but when it happens to me it happens to men too."</p> <p>"Wow, that sure sounds a lot like you, girlie. Why do you say that to me?" he said. "I love hearing it."</p> <p>"Because I love it. And I'd love to have sex with you, to have you in my bed and have you cumming all over me," she said. "What do I have to do for you too?"</p> <p>He answered immediately. "Go ahead," he said.</p> <p>"Do you really like to make guys cum?" she asked.</p> <p>He said, "Yes, I do." He paused for a moment and said, "Are you going to cum for me and cum for someone who is so nice, big and hard—who is so kind—that he will make you cum?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"And is it really okay to cum?" he asked. When he was done he added, "Let me cum and I'll get dressed as a guy and come back in here."</p> <p>"No!" she said. "I want to make you cum while you watch a movie like that and I want you to watch the movie, too."</p> <p>"So what do I get for letting you watch me have sex?" he asked.</p> <p>He got dressed while she listened quietly. She said, "Don't worry about it, Jack. I like it and I would absolutely love to watch you have sex and cum and cum."</p> <p>"I can't help it," he smiled.</p> <p>"I'm not getting any younger," she said. "Being twenty-two and single, and being married and being a successful artist and a successful businesswoman is just part of who I am and it makes it real. I've done things I shouldn't but part of me just wants the same things and wants whatever I can. You're the first person I have done anything with...and I want to try things," she said.</p> <p>"It's okay to talk about it, babe," he said. "I can tell that you're all excited and want things to happen. It's kind of sexy and a turn it on for a little bit of a turn on for me and I want for you, too, too, too, if you see. I mean. I can see your tits and like, too. I will like. I can touch and see. So we like, tits, and you can you have that and that and can feel and touch things there are a sex is—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
