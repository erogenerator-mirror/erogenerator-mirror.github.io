I should be glad, that the</strong> common sense approach to sex is the same as the principles of reason.</p> <p>So, if you think about your own personal life you'll come to understand that the principles of reason seem to be just that: principles. But then that's a whole other story, don't you think? It makes sense when you believe that they're right.</p> <p>So just to make the point, here's the deal: We want to get our sex toys to a sex shop, so that it will happen that way. What is sex? Well, since it's just sex with another woman and not with each other, and since it is just sex, if we take a swing vote and decide to buy what we want, there isn't really another woman for us to have sex with. That's a totally different kind of sex to us. We want sex with someone who's experienced it before we can experience it. I think that's the principle of the thing. Now that's a new line, doesn't it.</p> <p>But, so far our sex shop has, so far, nothing more to it than sexual pleasure to our satisfaction. What's an escort service, anyway? Well, what about the sex that we get in trade for money? Well, if you like those things, then we'd better start off with a little more of the basics anyway -- how can we show pleasure to each other?</p> <p>Well, lets start off with a couple of things first. Some people, anyway. For them that's okay but there are really two types of sex, though -- first the woman is the most fun to be had, and second the woman has sex with another person is fun. So basically, to be sure there's an easy, yet complicated way to be sure that you'll come along, that a woman is not in fact physically as beautiful as the woman you are already having the affair with, that it's not cheating, that sex is not wrong, and that you want the affair to go on as long as the sex is, and that the sex with her is, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.</p> <p>"There's actually a couple of things I know that I'd like if that's ever an option," she told me with a grin.</p> <p>Oh, right, she was referring to her own advice as she smiled and said so. That was, of course, not an easy choice to come by. I'm not much of a sex person at the moment. I do still like oral sex, though.</p> <p>Anyway, I'll go on now. She gave me a number of different vibrators. She said they were easy to put on a woman, that they would be good for her, that they were good for her body, and that a man could feel the vibrations of the clit by the outside of his body.</p> <p>She said that she had put a couple of different types of toys out, and it made it hard to control the amount of the orgasms that I would have to come into contact with -- but they were going to give her an awesome experience, so I'm definitely going to be there for her.</p> <p>I'll admit that my dick might not have been stiff when we first sat down, but it wasn't hard when we left the restaurant after lunch time.</p> <p>The idea of seeing someone else's partner having sex with another person is an entirely new experience. And I guess that, to be fair, the idea of watching another woman having sex with another person makes it very, very, very exciting. I mean, I love that idea, and being able to see her having sex with another guy; that's hot, but it can't be a turn on as much as the idea of not knowing another woman as a stranger to another guy -- particularly someone you've actually fantasied about. To have a fantasy of watching that person have sex with another person, is the ultimate taboo on the menu, but the actual reality is also a great turn-on, and to have watched someone else doing the same thing to another woman is an entirely different experience.</p> <p>Now one could be surprised at how many things can go on in your imagination, and to be able to have your own personal fantasy of other women having sex with each other as part of a sexual experience. But it is such a natural extension of sex. We've talked about it with other people around the block.</p> <p>We all have our own fantasies, and we all enjoy having that kind of eroticism we just occasionally experience. We all enjoy having sex with someone who isn't necessarily going for other women in that way. A woman who is not actually going for a guy who is, is, though, is not a man is a very kind of a little better to me, an idea for a lot, a different in general.</p> <p></p> <p>So, and you know she hadâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
