Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.</h4><p><strong>According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak. Much</strong> like the way it worked out, the sun was getting more sensitive because of the light. And there you have it. This will do it for you.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I'm ready.</p> <p>It's one of them things that really don't happen in this world of space and time because this is the life of a sentient being. It's something that comes down from a man's mind and the brain that's designed for a much higher-than-average capacity to comprehend that special perception; it takes a lot of skill and some patience to master; it's almost like using your own senses, the sight, the taste and the smell of food from the food you eat.</p> <p>I'm already a little tipsy, and yet so much of the fun is ahead.</p> <p>I think I'm gonna start this right. So I start rubbing my tits together, and they're really getting worked up. It's like you aren't even there; it's a different person than I first realized. But when I see a really strong sexual energy rush in your brain, it's like you feel an electric charge; and that's almost indescribable. And that's why I'm so turned on.</p> <p>There's no way that I can cum yet.</p> <p>Not yet.</p> <p>Now let's see if you really know how to do this.</p> <p>I start touching my tits with my fingertips. They're a little bigger than mine and a little pinker than my nipples -- I'm definitely not wearing a bra. And they're really hard and erect. My boobs are big enough that maybe your entire hand wouldn't fit under their own weight on it -- like a small hand; they must have been at least a size bigger than mine. My pinkie is just barely below the tips of my nipples, so all that's on my chest is a couple of inches. The inside part of my fingers are much darker. And my breasts are as nice as mine.</p> <p>Then I touch the outside of my tits.</p> <p>I touch it all the way back to the inside - all the way up to just where my nipple ends.</p> <p>Yes, right there.</p> <p>I try to squeeze those nipples with my fingers. I'm not quite good with fingers, but what do I do with them? They're so sensitive, and I could use a little more than my fingertips right now. The whole area around my nipples is a circle. I use my fingers to feel their heat from there.</p> <p>You are going to cum already, right?</p> <p>I know, right?</p> <p>I put two fingers in, so my whole hand is inside. My other hand is going to do the same thing. Do the same thing again in two different directions too. Then I use my thumb to touch the tip of my nipple, which is actually two inches bigger than my fingers, and it looks like an inch or two longer than my thumb. Maybe you've noticed that my thumb has a really light touch and I've never tried that before. Just the way my thumb rubs my nipple up and down, just the way my thumb circles the head of my nipple, just the way my nipples react to touching them. There is the most beautiful sensation I can call it, but it's not enough to cause my dick to start pulsing.</p> <p>And now I'm touching my nipple between fingers, and it feels... like I want to touch it like this and...</p> <p>Mmm. Can you hear me?</p> <p>Yes, but now, don't forget to breathe, because you're going to feel amazing. Do it, do it again, do it every time I touch.</p> <p>Do you think you should get my hand ready to go somewhere? Or...</p> <p>I don't know.</p> <p>Then I push my breasts up into my chest. Then I play with my nipples like yours.</p> <p>So... here it goes.</p> <p>My fingers start rubbing the sides of my tits, feeling all around the sides, the inside and the outer sides. Then I let my fingers go and they start rubbing my boobs as I go back and forth between them. The outer side is hard because of its length. My nipples are just a tiny bit bigger. My skin is very smooth, and I could feel it. I could feel the heat from my breasts and the texture of my skin; I could even feel it with a finger. I felt the warmth of my hand, the heat between my fingers and the warmth from my nipple.</p> <p>I let my hands slide over my breasts with the palms facing each other and the middle two fingers of my hands. I put my hands on my chest and I let the tips of my nipples press against my skin and I let my nipples rub against them up and down together, and I let the sides of my whole body go down.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>So, like that's what would happen to you.
