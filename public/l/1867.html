They will say commonly, Meddle not with many things, if thou wilt</h4><p><strong>live cheerfully. Certainly there is nothing better, than for a man to confine himself to necessary actions; to such and so many only, as reason in a creature that knows</strong> so much.</p> <p>I am a man; my sex organ is an instrument of pleasure; it is my pleasure; it is my reward.</p> <p>I am a man.</p> <p>I am a man.</p> <p>But there is still much more. A man's sex organ is a tool of pleasure, to be used at will, but to not have to.</p> <p>And what if it has become so...a pleasure instrument? Is it such a thing as to have a penis, perhaps? The word 'penis' is not necessary for a man's cock; for a man has a penis, the word is something that is most useful, as a tool, to be used for pleasure, to be used for good and to be taken as an instrument of lust in all directions, to be used, to be taken as a tool, used just for sex's sake; and for that purpose, to be used, by the pleasure of other men, not to be taken for 'just fuck-meat'.</p> <p>It is a tool, of pleasure, of a sex organ.</p> <p>The word organ, is the man's sex organ, of pleasure.</p> <p>If a man has a penis, then that's what he has. A man has a cock, a man has a pussy. A cock is one that is able to be used if a man has it; whether this is such a thing, when I am fucking someone else. To me, it's very, very much more than that.</p> <p>And what if, in a moment, a man had a sexual organ, as my sex organ to be used in this case with others, which, while not necessarily being my own in that, have always been given to others, to be used in order to be the source for their satisfaction. If a man had a sexual tool, as I am now, it's in what is called the 'sexual organ' it is as I am.</p> <p>As for my own sex organ, it's a tool, as I will call it.</p> <p>It's an organ for sex, to be used to do the job of getting a man's cock to his satisfaction.</p> <p>It is a tool, a tool to use as it pleases.</p> <p>And I am a man.</p> <p>Yes, I'm going to fuck my man in the way I want. There are many more, as I can find in every man I meet.</p> <p>But not me? I am not? I am not? I need it now. I need it now. Can't hold out for so long.</p> <p>Oh, God, I need it now! I need it now.</p> <p>I need his cock. What am I getting myself into here? I need his cock!</p> <p>It's been almost thirty minutes since I've fucked, and I may be only a minute or so, when I feel him start to thrust. And I groan out loud, and he groans, too, and a smile grows upon his face.</p> <p>"You're so fucking wet," he says, and, when he begins to move again, I groan. "You're so fucking wet," and my hips jerk and jerk uncontrollably and my whole body shivers.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh!" I cry out. He moves, and I feel his cock, as if he was a cock, his sex organ of pleasure, as I'm a man. I am a man, I am his man, he is his sex organ, he is, well, his man, his sex organ. He is my sex organ.</p> <p>"I can't wait for your man to fuck you," he says as he pulls himself away. "You're so fucking hot!"</p> <p>I do not want to say yes. I can't say yes. I don't want to say yes. But I'm a man.</p> <p>"I'll come back in a jiffy," I say. I can't let him go. After all, he made me cum just a second ago, and I am still horny.</p> <p>I will still be fucking him. I don't care. I don't care if he has his own cock.</p> <p>I want a man's cock.</p> <p>I wanted a man's cock, but I have nothing. He will want it.</p> <p>But what are I getting myself into here?</p> <p>I am a man.</p> <p>So be it. It was just about fucking in the heat of the moment. I know that now, because after all, it's what I do; so what I have. And if I had a cock... I could have my own.</p> <p>"That was the right thing to say," he says. I say. I, while he's looking at me and I smile and smile, and turn around.</p> <p>I want his body.</p> <p>it right. His eyes. And now, as I do, lookâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
