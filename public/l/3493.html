As her fingers reached for him, he pushed her away.</p> <p>‘There, now that’s what I like to hear!’, he teased, as his fingers spread the lube and pushed into her. ‘Just relax and let it happen.’</p> <p>‘It’s never too easy to relax. I mean, it’s just a bit stiff; but I like the feeling of having something in me, a nice, stiff cock in me.”</p> <p>‘But in me?’ she protested, which seemed to surprise him.</p> <p>‘Well, not quite,’ he said, ‘but you’ll find there is a little more resistance than that. It’s not the first time I have ever felt that myself’, he said, and began to push further.</p> <p>‘A bit of trouble there,’ she protested.</p> <p>‘Well, there should be some resistance’, he replied.</p> <p>I was feeling too proud to object. My cock was at attention; with the feeling of it coming into view, I felt sure I couldn’t help but reach my hand down to feel the lube.</p> <p>‘Ah, I don’t know what to do,’ I thought, ‘the lube, you mean.’</p> <p>‘Oh, yes,’ he replied with more enthusiasm. ‘I want to feel you do that.’ ‘And, I want you to fuck me,’ I continued to ask, feeling the pressure of her fingers close around my cock.</p> <p>‘Well,’ she said when it dawned on her, ‘you do.’</p> <p>‘Well, I’m all wet there,’ she added.</p> <p>There’s a lot I want to give up! I thought. There’s a lot more that I want to find out just what my mind can come up with! But I’m not a girl of little expectations anymore and I don’t expect that sort of thing to happen with any girl.</p> <p>But then I thought about it and, no... it has to be with someone I love, too. Someone with whom I can share sexual experiences. Someone willing to be there. Some guy whose cock is hard and ready and who is getting a good fucking while feeling really comfortable. Someone willing to take a chance and try something new.</p> <p>Maybe it’s a little different for real couples. You can have fun, but you can also, of course, want a lot more from someone else. And a guy with whom you can’t get laid has, on the contrary, provided it’s not all just the sex that he can enjoy. This is what a man and woman truly want, and when we can’t get it together, we’ll fuck.</p> <p>All that was quite true: I was feeling rather proud of myself, as I had been when the situation was beginning. And I was still standing between her legs, my dick standing out to just above my knees. She had put her hand up under her skirt and around my cock, which had been standing up for her, and was caressing it lightly as well.</p> <p>‘It’s getting longer now.’ she remarked.</p> <p>‘It’s getting stiffer,’ I said.</p> <p>She smiled and put her foot up against my leg where her panties had been.</p> <p>In the meantime, I was watching my dick getting a bit bigger.</p> <p>‘Are you ready,’ she asked, as her hand gently squeezed around my hard cock.</p> <p>‘I think so.’ I replied, my hand stroking her leg, feeling it through her skirt.</p> <p>‘Come on.’ she said gently. my hand stroking her leg.
