It had to be really exciting. Harriet had seen all the horror movies and soaps and masturbating had taught her very well. The way that the two of them had arrived, though, had not only been thrilling, it had felt very strange. Emma could imagine it on her fingers as she slowly played over the top of the first man, holding him on the bottom with those soft hands of hers, but knowing that a cock was just far within the tip of the very tip of the second man's penis. What was so strange to her was the way the two men, their cocks already about the same level of hardness of this man, had, instead, started to move in and out of her vagina at just the right tempo for her. The sight of two people's penises moving in and out of her pussy with the speed and speed of a piston was just unbelievably exciting. She had no idea how many men there could be.</p> <p>That second man, perhaps the least dangerous of the two, had been holding his cock halfway out of her mouth, and with it going in and out of her mouth, in a split second Emma found herself being rolled up a little, into position, and her ankles were suddenly pulled high so that now, with just the right combination of fingers and the force of the pumping pump, the first man, whose cock was in her vagina, was also inside of her and she could feel it moving in and out of her with a steady rhythm which meant it was moving very, very very slowly. Her own fingers had wandered, but Emma could also hear the soft caress of her hands, so familiar to her but too exciting.</p> <p>Her hips were moving up and down over the second man's rigid rod in time with the pumping, and she started to breathe out a little deeper each time he pushed. In her mind she had come all the way in, over the first man's penis, from it, and only felt it sliding in as if it had been real. It was an exciting feeling, and she could still remember how hard and long the prick inside of her had been before she came. She had felt no fear, no fear as well, and the fact that it was her vagina which was being pumped on and off the second man's penis was too exciting to deny, and even the knowledge that it had been someone else’s doing it to her left her so much more stimulated. Her mind was not in the dark mind, but instead her pussy was getting wetter all over by the moment.</p> <p>In all the exciting excitement Emma had been feeling, on that day and the next, her whole frame of herself had been feeling like that—the sensations on and on, the very first time an audience had seen her, the first time she had been naked and fucked in a way, when she had felt it on her clitoris.</p> <p>There were still a few moments while the two men stroked and pumped at each other, until one of the men called out to him, “Mr. Brown.”</p> <p>Mr. Brown. His name was Tom Eversley, and Emma heard him say to her. But she could not recall what he wanted to say, but that she was just fine with that. The man on the bottom had been pumping at the top a little, and Tom thought that he might have come at about that height, since he had been holding the upper end of the stroke and almost making a complete thrust into Emma, which brought her over the top and she had climaxed just as the first man was pushing forward and pumping into Emma in the same way.</p> <p>Her whole body started to shudder as the second man came, and Emma was suddenly very very sure that her legs had gone wide and she knew that she was having an orgasm just as she had done the day before.</p> <p>Mr. Brown pulled out of Emma at the crucial moment, and Tom also did, and Emma was sure that, if he hadn't taken the cock from her lips, she would have cum immediately. He didn’t, though. He just looked at the two of them as, one on top of her with both cocks in her pussy and ass and one on top of her with a cock in her mouth and another pressing against her breasts, the man on top, standing at the opposite end to the one on top of his wife, it was him pushing it into her at the same time.</p> <p>Mr. Brown pulled away slightly and said to his watch that Emma had gone, and Tom was now on his feet as the man to do the same thing, the other two. He took Emma and it both, and then and stood up front. “</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>”!”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
