For it can never be</strong> broken, even though in an infinite infinite infinity, all are finite in their own way. If we live forever, and are given the joy of life and bliss, the greatest of our universe, we will always find love in our own bodies, not the other way around.</p> <p>I was already naked, and it didn't take her a minute for me to lift a heavy foot to the bed. I laid my wet cock against her mound.</p> <p>"It's yours, baby," I told her, pressing her head down on the bed.</p> <p>My cock started poking itself into her slit. "Oh, you feel good," she said, as I pushed my way inside her.</p> <p>"Want to watch me jack off?" I asked her.</p> <p>I could already see that she was nervous, that she was not used to such a big cock. "No," she said, but said nothing, she just kept watching me.</p> <p>I pushed my cock deeper into the warmth of her pussy.</p> <p>In a moment, my eyes opened up to her. "Do you like watching me fuck you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Mmmhmm," I answered, my eyes still fixed on her.</p> <p>"Have you liked me jerking off to this?" she asked, her voice a little sluttish now, as she lifted her head.</p> <p>My cock was starting to get a little stiff in my pants, so I said, "Wouldn't you love to see me in my suit? Just me in a uniform."</p> <p>"I might like to change my mind, after I finish with you, if I can watch you while you jack off," she responded, in a husky voice, which made my cock jerk in her pussy.</p> <p>"Do it, baby. Shoot a load of cum inside me," I cried out.</p> <p>"I'll keep you warm until you think your cock will die." Her sweet ass was now bouncing on my lap, and she pulled me close to her. My dick slipped through her cunt-lips without any resistance. "Oooohh! Do it, baby," she cooed. "Just do it."</p> <p>Our eyes met, but our lips were still locked together. I started fucking her in the same slow and steady pace as I remembered the pleasure of the afternoon. Her mouth made little squeaky sounds as I pushed my cock into her. I knew we were both about to climax, and I hoped that the intensity of our orgasm would prolong.</p> <p>She cried out that she was going to come, first, but as my cock started jerking inside her, she moaned out, "Yessss!"</p> <p>"Oh, God! Yes! Just come on me," I cried out, and then held myself as deep inside her pussy as I could go.</p> <p>Her vagina convulsed around my cock.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, baby! Fuck my cunt!" she cried out.</p> <p>In seconds of her orgasmic quaking all my brain could think of was how sexy it was, watching my cock disappear inside that wet little hole. Her face told me that she had cum herself, too.</p> <p>"Fuck it! Fuck my pussy!" she cried out again. It was all I needed to hear. She was cumming, and I couldn't hold back any more.</p> <p>"Here it comes! Here it comes!" I yelled as I started shooting my load into her.</p> <p>I kept coming inside her. She'd cumming for a long time, which she was almost done with now that we were done.</p> <p>We lay there as a happy couple, my shrinking cock still inside her body, my eyes still half closed. And we looked at each other. Her smile was still broad across her face. I kissed her shoulder, and she turned around to look at me. I was a bit sad that we had ended our sex-talk, but we did.</p> <p>Then she said, "You're a fucking luckier lover than I thought you would be."</p> <p>"And I can't wait for our next trip, lover. You can do me any sexy woman who makes me hornyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
