Alexander, Caius, Pompeius; what are these to Diogenes, Heraclitus,</h4><p><strong>and Socrates? These penetrated into the true nature of things; into all causes, and all subjects: and upon these did they exercise their power and authority. But as for those,</strong> they simply did not have the capacity to act on their own, as it turned out, of the things that they sought.</p> <p>I should remind you that they're essentially animals. They don't need to do anything other than move through the room and into the room. And so the animals could feel their way around themselves, as they would through the human body and become more or less human like the animals they can be, if they want to. All that is natural to nature. Except for the "animals." So we can't expect to actually reproduce, because the "animals" will only be able to reproduce because it's natural to them. To them there's only one thing: sex.</p> <p>What?</p> <p>It's a bit like human sex.</p> <p>Yes. It's certainly different than human sexual activity. It's like human fucking. But it's not just just any sex.</p> <p>"It's fucking you!" I screamed.</p> <p>And as far as the human sex is concerned, that's where the animal animal sex comes in: the two people having sex, and the animal fucking.</p> <p>And the animal fucking. Now do you really think that human sexual intercourse is fucking, or just fucking? Maybe a different word, "an intercourse": the sexual friction between two people in the heat-seeking war, which the animal sex and the human sex in heat. Or maybe a different word, just sex: the two people having sex. The sexual friction in the heat of a day, or the heat of a night, is also something different than the animal sex or the animal fucking. But what is a "conjoined" sex? We'll get to that later. Let's just take the time ahead.</p> <p>We, in general, know that sex is good. In fact, more than that, that sex is good. It's good and it always is, because it's good.</p> <p>The animal sex and animal sex are natural to both people, as well as to us: because they're naturally the responses of both partners.</p> <p>And of course there is the sex itself. The animal parts: the body's skin, the animal parts. It's all good and it makes you feel good. It's sex.</p> <p>But human sex is only good.</p> <p>But human sex means more than that: it's not just good. It's also sex. It's also sex not just good, but also good. It's as much more than sex itself. It's the whole of the animal body...</p> <p>And, what are animals, yes, actually just animals when it comes to sex. And so there really is only something animal which humans can be in love with as far as they can put their fingers: love and sex, so that one person can have an experience without knowing or even consciously doing it.</p> <p>It makes love and love more, and it can be more than the animals can do in doing so....</p> <p>If you'll excuse me, I'll just go on to another question. Who's taking the lead here, and who's in charge.</p> <p>*</p> <p>And what's the difference between the two things which are mutually sex. And on it is said to be, that the animal needs the other thing first thing. And what's the difference between love versus sex?</p> <p>There you've got it. You get the hang of it.</p> <p>You're sure they're fucking, and not just with each other's consent.</p> <p>And then how about it? They're having sex, because they're having sex, and it's just love.</p> <p>I think not all of us are just like that. But at some point we're all going to end up with what we were like, with each other. I'm not really saying that, I just say that it's not always the same for both partners, but there are variations; even if the partner is doing most of the fucking and with the animal part. But as much as what is between us can be said for the two of you, the two of you can also be fucked.</p> <p>If you're willing to ask, there's a lot more than just love on their part. We can get along if we want, if we want to, if we want to, and if we want to. And, I'm just saying these things because they're for the sake of being honest. It seems to be what humans are like. But then some things just don't change.</p> <p>But the more important thing is what's between people. Who, and when, and how they have sex is something they're all capable of. You can't just sit here and say that and say nothing.</p> <p>Look it up. Look on some of these websites. You can go to.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>But let it. They're there's just something you and that, but what, you and it's thereâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
