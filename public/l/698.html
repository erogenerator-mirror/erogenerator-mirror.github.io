Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration events occur solely by</strong> their bodies.</p> <p>This story features many of the common themes of hero and monster relationships, with much more in common.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>As he lay sleeping on the bed, Alex was awakened with a start. He opened his eyes only to see his daughter's eyes staring at him in shock. She looked like an angry school girl, sitting on his face. Alex's mouth hung open as he struggled in vain to catch his breath. He had to do something to defend his daughter from his lustful desires.</p> <p>"Mom! What's happened?"</p> <p>Alex's heart raced as he heard his mother speaking in a soothing tone. He struggled for some kind of an excuse that he could hide. This was just about to happen.</p> <p>"Mom!"</p> <p>Alex groaned as he woke up to the feeling of his cock rising in his boxers at the thought of his daughter's tongue licking his cock. He reached down to cover himself as his mother continued speaking in a soothing tone.</p> <p>"Alex, get out, now. You are going crazy. Stop thinking. I can help. It feels so good," she said.</p> <p>Alex sighed, "but I have to pee," as he said it.</p> <p>"Oh I have other plans for you," she said as she looked at him seductively. He had gotten used to her calling him daddy, but now she referred to him like a son.</p> <p>"No mom, don't. I have to pee," he said as he gave up trying to cover him. His cock was throbbing and he wanted to be in his room when it arrived, but he couldn't. He had given up when his mother said she had to go.</p> <p>"Now, go! Don't think of it," she said, putting her arms around him and running her hands over his chest.</p> <p>He let her hold him and groaned as his cock began to throb as well. He closed his eyes and moaned to herself.</p> <p>"Mom, go back to sleep. I don't know what I am thinking," he said to his cock.</p> <p>"I am doing this to you, but it feels good. It also feels good. Don't you think it feels bad to do this to?"</p> <p>"Yes, mom," he said, his voice a moan.</p> <p>"Oh honey, come here," she said as she pushed him toward the door and he stumbled over the threshold.</p> <p>He walked down the hall with his head hanging low. His eyes were fixed on his cock that was bobbing in front of him as he walked. He felt his loins getting warm at the thought of seeing it throb and cum in front of him. He had let his mother use his bathroom to relieve her sexual frustrations. Now, he was standing naked with his cock throbbing in front of him.</p> <p>"Alex, we shouldn't do this. Mom, I don't want to do this," he said as he held his cock and looked away.</p> <p>"Come here. We don't have to be anything, we just need to know what happens between us," she said pushing him toward the bathroom.</p> <p>"No mom," he said as he let his cock slide over his abs as he walked over to his mother who was standing under the sink. He took his cock and pressed it against her and held it in front of her face.</p> <p>"Mom, we don't have to do this, we just need to know," Alex said firmly.</p> <p>"No we don't. We can't stop this," she said staring into his eyes with fear and lust.</p> <p>"I need to go, mom, we can't do this," Alex said as he pulled away.</p> <p>She smiled. "Go Alex. Have fun."</p> <p>They went to his room without saying a word, but their eyes were glued on each other. She pushed him in the doorway and turned. They stared at each other like a pair of wild animals watching each other. He bent his head close to her face and they kissed. His cock stood at attention when they touched, and it seemed like they would explode at any second. Their tongues explored each other's mouths as they pressed her to the floor and began to explore each other's bodies.</p> <p>Her hands were exploring his back and shoulders, running over his ass. She held his cock tightly against his body as she looked up at his eyes. Their tongues danced while they kissed and caressed. Alex's hands slid down to her shoulders, pulling her towards him. Her nipples felt as if they had been trapped in a heavy wool blanket. He groaned as her hands slipped under his shirt to rub her bra-covered breasts.</p> <p></p> <p>their lovemaking was becoming more passionate as the more erotic. Their lust. Their eyes were locked on each other's wanting their. makingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
