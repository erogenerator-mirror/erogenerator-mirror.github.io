So now was the time to go, so he was a little shocked when he entered the empty classroom.</p> <p>When he entered the room it still felt more like a dream. His dream girl from yesterday, and he was going to be so lucky to have her on his arm. He watched his every word as he smiled, and when she smiled back he did in fact feel good, and after she had returned to him the following day was even better.</p> <p>Pierre had already found, after waiting all day for his girlfriend to return, that he loved her in a special way.

When her friend, Claire, had been on her way home, he had been glad to take that second part of it into consideration. He was glad that the reason for this short stay hadn't happened without knowing about the first part of Claire's journey.</p> <p>His smile had changed the whole time, he just hoped he wouldn't be the one to make the first move. And at the same time he knew it was the best thing that could happen in his life. He was going to have a beautiful girlfriend, and he knew he was going to get a chance to have real sex with her later that evening.</p> <p>And then he was going to make love with his girlfriendâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
