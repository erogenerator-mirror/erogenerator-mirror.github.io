(Your birthday is coming up soon, and you cannot take advantage of your innocence. We have some new traditions to add to your life here.)</p> <p>*</p> <p>Gerry's eyes darted around the room, looking around for any sign of the child. What could it be that they would find her at this point? He didn't care too much for people to find out they only existed to fuck. He only knew what an interesting thing it was to find out she was the person she claimed to be, and that they'd be fucking her to the best of her abilities, and he wasn't about to leave her out like this once he got his cock out of this place.</p> <p>Gerry's mind was on the moment, looking around the room again. Nothing to say to his mind-numbing, or perhaps something like, 'Oh, God, this is so stupid!' He could feel his erection throbbing in his pants as he sat down in one of the leather chairs, and that he should leave soon if she was going to come and get a present. And there she was, all beautiful and pretty and perfect, looking to be young again. She should be old enough, and he was sure she was ready to be fucked, despite her age.</p> <p>Gerry reached over and squeezed her hand. "Let's go, sweetheart." He took his hand from her hand and placed it back on her wrist. "Let's go... we're in a museum," he said, and then he left the room before she had a chance to say something.</p> <p>"What, you can't tell anyone what's going on, right?" she wondered as Gerry opened the door and closed it. He wasn't as concerned with what their parents were doing as they were. She'd know it wasn't a family museum.</p> <p>Gerry stepped out into the hallway of the museum. "Do you have a flashlight to be honest with?" he asked. "It may take a while, but I've got a torch and a couple of things I think you've probably seen, don't you?" He laughed and shook his head. "It's just that I've always wanted to find someone to fuck, you know? I'm not a bad boyfriend. I always wanted to see girls getting their asses fucked. I'd never try it myself, but I never thought that I could tell who I'd want to try, and I was always ready to find someone if they suggested it."</p> <p>Gerry thought her eyes were bright and sparkling as she listened to the conversation between him and the man on the right, while he tried his best to take the torch that she had in her hand.</p> <p>"You're not a bad boyfriend," she said, trying to look as casual as possible.</p> <p>"So? I'm not a bad boyfriend, and you don't know anybody that I've seen, and you know how much I enjoy fucking, so you can trust me," he shrugged. "What else would you like?" he said, as he handed her the torch and stepped back out into the hall again.</p> <p>"Do you have a flashlight, or something?" she asked, suddenly realizing that he'd left her a good ten yards before the man on the right had gotten out of his car.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't, like, need help. I do my work here." He stepped closer to her. "And I have a flashlight," he said, taking a step back until he bumped against her. He leaned in close to her ear, taking her earlobe in his mouth. "I'm gonna take your flashlight," he said, as he unzipped her dress, freeing her breasts and allowing her dress to fall from her chest. He grabbed them and squeezed and pulled them. As she closed her eyes and groaned, he dropped her panties.</p> <p>His touch made her feel as though she was made of glass, and it made her tingle. "I'm not so sure I want to try it out," she said as she felt his hands on her breasts.</p> <p>Gerry laughed as he began squeezing and pushing his erection in his pants.</p> <p>The man on the right spoke up. "This might feel quite awkward if we go a little different in your experience. You'll have to try it if you want to really fuck."</p> <p>Gerry's mouth opened. She had no idea what her experience would be like, but she was sure it would involve a lot more than a mere sexual encounter. "experience!"</p> <p>Gerry's thoughts were interrupted as he walked up the corridor; "We are going to go up, and stay down and up.</p> <p></p> <p>down. .
