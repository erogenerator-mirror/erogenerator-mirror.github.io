Danglars’ Signature</h4><p><strong>The next morning dawned dull and cloudy. During the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office, and wrapped the corpse in the winding-sheet, which, whatever may be said about</strong> it, had been a tradition of their forebodings for millennia. Now, even an extra hour or so of sleep could not so quickly make it past the night, as there were the occasional dreams that didn't include the old world.</p> <p>The last man lying on the nightstand, an older white-nailed, distinguished-looking policeman, held out a plastic box for the police precinct. The policeman lifted the lid. There was a woman, not so much taller than average, with her feet tucked between the front and back of the bed, and her head on a pillow. Her skin shone from under the heavy curtains. There was a faint light across the bed. She too was asleep.</p> <p>The policeman opened the box. It had been long since the last time the police had taken a dump. The only piece of furniture and evidence that came out of the box was the white dildo of his wife from last night's fun. The plastic phallus was the last scrap of the woman. The policeman removed it from the box, and returned it to the nightstand. When he placed it on the nightstand, he turned it over so that the light was dimmed, revealing that she had indeed slept with the plastic dildo inside her vagina.</p> <p>The young policeman moved the box away from the bed, and set it on the floor in front of it. After that one quick motion he moved over towards the door. In the bedroom door was the only light. The police officer had been in bed a few seconds ago. He had watched her sleep, while waiting for a decent night's sleep. Now the man, who was, after all, his wife, was about to leave the room. He closed the door behind him, and left it silent.</p> <p>The policeman returned to the bed. He stood next to the bed with his arms open ready to wrap around a woman. He had been watching her for long enough that he was just about to come out of the room again. The police officer was just about to get a move on his wife when the young police officer came home from working. After all he had slept in the room for over five hours yesterday night, he would be here in only one hour. And, before him was his beautiful wife, a woman whose life was all but lost, and who was now a widow of some years.</p> <p>The officer turned from one wall window, to his bed, and looked at himself. He pulled back the sheets, and revealed with his eyes that he was no longer asleep. He was nude lying in the middle of his wife's bed. The penis he had come to cherish last night had vanished into her womb. This was his woman and the man he had been dreaming of for over a month.</p> <p>The policeman's penis was aching for action. The head of his penis had longed for it's own lovemaking. It was as hard inside his wife's body as it had been outside for two whole months. He had not wanted to go back this way to sleep for over a month. In fact, there were too many of them.</p> <p>He quickly lay down next to his wife, who sat up, and turned over sideways. The policeman held his penis in his hand and stroked it just as he had done with the first night. His wife had a look of utter ecstasy on her face. He began to slide his penis in and out of her vagina in rhythm with her strokes of the dildo.</p> <p>Then, just as his penis was getting ready for a long day, as it neared its climax, he stopped. This would be the beginning of his day of ecstasy. The policeman stood at the foot of the bed and looked back at his wife. This was still another night of her life. This was the second phase of their marriage. Their last night of love. She was a married woman. She would have had her own life. He had seen her die for years, had been close to her grave, had even held a baby. He was going to experience it all again tonight, tonight, after he had fucked and sucked her husband's penis all night for over two hours.</p> <p>As the policeman got closer and closer, he had an idea. He knew all sorts of people who had fucked the policeman, but none that knew about the man's business. He felt that, having made his wife a widow of a lifetime last night, he could leave his penis behind in her vagina. She would be alone. He had had all the time in the world to enjoy the woman he had just come to love last night. He knew that he could do it in the morning. In just a few hours he could have her as a man of the woman he loved every moment of last night. He was going to have her. He had left the life behind, to have his wife at last night with the man who had wanted to have a wife the life only. He would never be his marriage—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
