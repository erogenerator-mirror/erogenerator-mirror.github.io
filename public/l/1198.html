Those who have preserved some memory of this</strong> place do not speak English, but they do the job correctly.” I thought that if any of them knew of the city where we lived, that they might well speak it and make fun of it. Then I thought that maybe I would surprise them by saying “I am a gun collector,” like most of them. I realized that my answer was the right one: I will never know the exact words I said; if I speak correctly, I can learn to write, write, write. There are some who say that a gun makes them happy, but I never would believe them. I was not sure that anyone was the kind of person they would consider a gun collector. “Let me teach you now,” I said in a voice I could not understand. “I have always admired and envied you, but that’s one of the things that scares me too, when you go out looking for men to kill. I never knew anything like that and I cannot think of a hundred more good things to get you away from my eyes.”</p> <p>I pulled him between us as I knelt before him on the rug of the middle floor. I looked straight into his eyes as I pulled him towards me and guided him by force of will. He leaned over me until our faces were at shoulder-level and his body came to rest on the middle one where my shoulder met my neck. His upper arms, upper legs and his chest were touching my back, with our faces just inches apart. This pose held him tight so that it seemed impossible but I was not going to be able to move. So, I kissed him, with a little tongue exploring. He opened his mouth and we kissed very very very deeply. I held him tight in that position while I kissed my way down his body, until I got to his cock. I began to lick and suck his cock, but at the last minute, I let it go. He had been very quiet during his little blowjob, but he didn’t move an inch. I could feel him growing ever larger as my tongue drenched his cock. He put his penis into my throat as I began to swallow. I could feel my throat muscles constrict around the head as the first jet of his come hit the back of my throat. It was the first time I choked. He had come so much, that his cock never quit shrinking and I kept swallowing until I could make no more. If the rest of his penis was still in my mouth, I knew I would keep it in just long enough for him to finish fucking my mouth at that moment. It was not enough, so I leaned backward and kissed him again, and then he took my place kneeling between us with my cock resting on his back, still holding him tightly in his hands. It was now my turn to kiss my way down between his legs. My tongue and lips worked his cock until it was hard and aching for cock. It was impossible to do this in a position without putting my hands on his butt to hold it, but I managed. He was still hard when I began to suck him back to a full erection. When he was ready to fuck, I took a firm hold of it and he began to slowly thrust himself into me. He had fucked a dozen or more virgins during the day, so I assumed that he was ready as soon as he moved. After he was completely impaled on my eager penis, he began to move again as if fucking my face. It took all of my concentration to keep still and not try to keep myself going without coming. This didn’t come naturally to me; it was probably more of a reflex movement because it was my first time fucking a man’s face. All I felt when I was getting a hard cock into my mouth, sucking, was the pressure of his head on the top lip at the bottom as his cock moved in and out of my mouth. Sometimes the head would brush me from inside my mouth and I was able to relax my mouth so that I could hold on to it, but I still had to breath. All the time, I felt like I was going to come when he thrust himself into me at a steady pace, but was very careful not to let up on his motion. He thrust himself with all his available will into me. His long shaft and his hand on my back almost brought me to orgasm. When he was pounding me from behind in just a few strokes, I felt I would come. But after a few strokes, I could not take any more and was about to come as I felt his balls against my shaft. He kept thrusting into me, as I came but not very much, but just as his climaxes spurts made me to shoot. I did me. I had never felt like the spasms, from a man or orgasms. It was not enough for me to be so easy to fuck. I had become like a man—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
