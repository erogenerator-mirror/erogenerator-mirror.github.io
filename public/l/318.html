SEWARD’S DIARY</h4><p><strong>3 October.—Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I can recall</strong>, but, it is a present for anyone interested in getting to know you. Thanks for taking time to read it. I'll send it to you as soon as I'm done.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>I had my arm around Kate's shoulder.</p> <p>What's good for the gander isn't good for the goose. Maybe there were some things I wasn't doing, but I couldn't help but wonder if what Kate and I really did might be a little more than an old ruse to be just friends. Maybe it was a subtle suggestion. Maybe, I might be imagining that Kate was something else entirely, but she could be doing just what I was.</p> <p>A little while later, we were in the car heading home, all the way to the lake, when Kate said to me, "Come on, Jimmy, let's get home," and took me by the hand. In the back of the car, she said, "Come on, Jimmy, let's go to bed. I've missed you. Go ahead."</p> <p>It was hard for me to look her in the eye and not notice the bulge that was growing inside my jeans. There was no doubt that Kate loved me; we've been together for five years. There was no doubt that Kate loved me and, even if she didn't want to, she still did.</p> <p>We didn't have the privacy of our own car, so if we were alone in the car, we would have to be careful. It wouldn't be the first time we had seen each other naked. We could not be seen having sex; most of the time, it was all pretend. Still, if somebody happened to see us together, we would be in trouble.</p> <p>Kate had seen a lot of naked women. Her breasts were, like, spectacular, but, at the same time, she probably wouldn't find them unattractive. They were probably too large, but, at the same time, they weren't all that bad. I could understand why Kate liked them and that I liked them.</p> <p>"I really want to, um, I mean, to, you know, we can, um, get naked," I said, blushing while I spoke. At the same time, I had a strange sensation of guilt about what we were doing. I remembered being shy, but this feeling was mixed with something else as well.</p> <p>I tried to give Kate the same answer I had given myself when we first got naked. We could get naked at the lake; she could take off her sweater and I would get naked. We could go to bed and have a wonderful, happy, erotic reunion that wasn't just for sex—but, if it happened, it would become the best experience ever of our lives or, possibly, a hundred times better.</p> <p>Kate's nipples were still erect, pointing straight at me, and I could take both her and her sweater. I could go to bed and have a wonderful, satisfying, sexual reunion. There was a brief hesitation about going further, but we were both naked and, for the moment, I was the one taking charge. I had the desire to see Kate naked. I did.</p> <p>The cabin was pretty nice, but, more importantly, we were going to have sex. On the lake. That meant not going to bed alone. We both had to go to bed separately. That meant sex. We were going to have sex alone.</p> <p>I thought it might be better if we got dressed and went our separate ways. I really tried to think more like Kate and was going to be ready to go out to dinner later that night and to bed later that night and to sleep alone, but, I had a pretty good case of the horny man in me.</p> <p>"Yeah," I whispered in her ear before I kissed her, and, then, before I kissed her again, I said, "I know not all of this is true."</p> <p>"Hush. You can still say that to me," Kate whispered back while putting her sweater and sweater on. I could smell just how pretty she looked; I could still taste the difference between her skin and what I had smelled on my lips in our lovemaking. I was still uncertain and unsure how I felt about sex, but as a lover in a relationship with the woman I love, I realized that this was the moment and the momentous moment I had been waiting for since I was twenty-years-old.</p> <p>The next day, late afternoon, when I got home from work and went to bed again, just as Kate and me had planned, Kate came into my arms and gave me a big hug. It felt so good. We should make love one another kiss first. To have a kiss. I'm first. We can love it. Love us kissing me first make it all the first, we make a kiss be lovers. We have our loves. We have no love. It was kissing—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
