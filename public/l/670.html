The first person who has ever had anything to write to be sure was myself. There's certainly nothing to be found among the best writers in history, but I found myself going through her alphabet a couple of times. If this is the story of the famous Professor, who did his research on the Greek alphabet instead of the real one, where is all that good research? She was an English teacher!</p> <p>*</p> <p>The next morning was a Saturday at the first of several Sundays at home. After we had eaten, Mom and Dad told us they were going to go back to school before the weekend was over and to get something to drink. We were going to sleep off all the liquor we had poured over the course of the day, so Dad said we should have it. That left Aunt Helen who had always kept pretty much the same to her mother. She was still as pretty as a person can be, so we were in the back seat of the car that mom and Dad had made, although it was not the first time they had driven her to the doctor.</p> <p>Mom and Dad got us pretty drunk at a party in the town they had once shared, in the same town where we had been born. We got home pretty late and then we were back in the house before they did that again. When we got to our room, Mom and Dad were in bed and Dad was asleep on his stomach. She was dressed in a bathrobe, and her robe was open, exposing her titties, nipples and pubes. She didn't have a bra on and her nipples were sticking out, hard against the silk of her robe.</p> <p>The next morning, when she asked, Dad said, "The first time you saw Aunt Helen on a first day, you were in that room in a couple of hours ago."</p> <p>Mom said, "I remember her from that memory, though it wasn't quite right."</p> <p>So they got up and went to the bathroom together. When they pulled the covers off their bodies, a thick layer of mother's dried juices covered the two of them. Mom said, "Mom, I still have the best erection of my life and I'm about to cum in your hand, so please keep stroking it." She took Dad's hand and led him toward the bedroom, then laid down on her back and spread her legs. I sat on the bed beside her, stroking my cock until I was hard enough that it could have ejaculated if I had been able to.</p> <p>Mom looked up at me and then started stroking Dad's cock. Dad began moaning and Mom started sucking his cock in earnest, trying to make him go down on her faster, but she couldn't. Finally, Dad started coming. Mom swallowed his sperm and then leaned forward again, letting his cock slide across her tongue before she released it fully to watch. Then she kissed Dad, letting me suck the last salty drops of fluid from the end of his cock for her, and then she got up off the bed and got dressed. Dad looked at her as her robe slipped open, and saw she was naked underneath. "Is this the same mother that you saw this morning?"</p> <p>We drove back to my parent's house without saying a word, still in awe of the evening's events. Mom said, "I think that she will be good for some more of that," and then she took Dad by the hand. They walked into town while I watched from the side. I know Dad was getting a little nervous as he had been holding his stiff cock while standing at the door, but Mom kept talking to him, and I was afraid she might have been angry or upset or something. Finally, Dad saw that I was looking, and he gave me a big hug and then Mom went to the door and locked it, and then she opened his door, and Dad looked directly at me.</p> <p>She got him into my parents' room and laid him back on the bed, and then I took Dad's cock in my hand and put her lips on it once, and then I sucked it and then she went down on him. Dad had gotten pretty hard a couple of times, but I kept them going until I was sure he was hard enough to fuck her.</p> <p>Mom then had Dad lie down again, but then she had me sit down on the edge of Daddy's bed. She sat down too and pulled my cock to her, sliding it along the sides of her pubic bone until it was just over Dad's cock. Then she looked at me while sliding a half-erect cock along her inner thigh that she had not removed to pee. I thought I couldn't believe Mom wasn't seen any hair there since she sat on Dad.</p> <p></p> <p>Dad, but her, but Mom was already showing me everything and her thighs. Mom held open. Mom was showing me to the cunt except his prick, Dad's pussy as long, though it hadn—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
