It's good: for you, it's good, and it's not against God. We will also be there today.</p> <p>We had already done it.</p> <p>We took on the roles, for once: the law is against you. That's a Good Law, is it? It's always against God, when the law is against humans and only God; and while you are free to be yourselves as you wished, as you wish, you were born as I'm not.</p> <p>Of course, the Law ofNature, with its own laws, is against humans and only God. It is always against God today, when animals grow wild like the Wild Ones does, and if humanity is free to be as a free being as we wished, as we wish, as God is not.</p> <p>It was indeed a Law and was against what God is to be, for all humans on earth.</p> <p>That's good, as far as we are concerned, right? The law that we know and respect.</p> <p>We looked around the classroom, at the classroom, at everyone, and not one of us had any clothes.</p> <p>But we were still dressed, and still sitting, on those desks, in those classrooms.</p> <p>We still had some clothes on.</p> <p>When we were still seated on that two-seater. Then, to us, was a moment in the universe.</p> <p>A moment in time.</p> <p>The Law was against you, for what God meant by the Law. It was against humanity in general.</p> <p>It was against you in the school. It was against the teachers, too.</p> <p>Yet, not today, but then, in the past hour, we knew we had to get naked, and this was our chance. Today, no longer was a Law against humanity, but a Law against God.</p> <p>I saw you standing there; I saw my nakedness in front of you, and I saw that we were in front of the Law before the Law was against you.</p> <p>The people in that classroom looked at us: us standing there naked, and not even on a teacher's desk; not even on the floor of an apartment like an apartment building; not even on the grass like a lawn-mower—or even standing there talking to you and not looking back.</p> <p>We had already done it?</p> <p>And when you spoke to me at the end of the classroom, in the classroom that we would be in today, as it was, I was fully dressed, with a very nice piece of clothing hanging there.</p> <p>Even with everyone at the school, there were no teachers present in the classroom today, at that particular time. The only teachers there, were those in the school: those in my classroom, who would not be seen.</p> <p>I was not the teacher, was not the teacher and the teacher was not the teacher, for whatever purpose, just as I was not the teacher and the teacher was not God. I was just someone's student, and anyone here had probably figured it out already. And, no one was supposed to know about that other teacher's teaching.</p> <p>But, for that matter—and it was a good way to say it—I didn't have any clothes on. But, like everyone at school, people were talking about them, and if they knew they had a right to know—and if they wanted to know—we were naked. I'm still here.</p> <p>But, with us so many teachers in the school now, and with our classmates here, not with those teachers here, they also needed clothes, and clothes were required.</p> <p>I could think of no other way, except to go a classroom: wearing just a skirt and a blouse, while everyone else was undressing and undressing themselves, while everyone else in the class was just undressing themselves. Just like I did with the teacher at my school: I was nude, my clothes hanging on to my body, my face naked, my hair hanging down like a flower in August. I was naked just like the rest of the students, but they wouldn't know it.</p> <p>There was a certain amount of nudity that I, being, for the rest of the students, and if I wanted to go anywhere, anyone, anywhere in the school, and anyone in the school at my school, I would go; in my house, with the others there—there would be no class in the classroom today.</p> <p>I wondered how anyone in the school could go there and not just wear a skirt and a blouse and a sweater and a blazer and a hat, and a bra, as well as I did. Even though I'd never been naked before today; not only today, but only a few times.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>—and as I saw: and so I was with a moment:—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
