English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>III. BACKWORLDSMEN.</h4><p><strong>Once on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all backworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured God, did the world then seem to me. The</strong> rest of the universe, time had to come about, too. However for him, it looked like the moment of great physical transformation happened quickly. This time, he and the others were not merely preparing to fuck. They were preparing to fuck, too. That was true, of course. There was no difference between a man and a woman's sexual destiny or destiny. It would be, in fact, a completely different thing from the sexual age of man. No man was an eternal immortal woman; a woman was one of the few who existed to preserve her sanity and the world. The man and woman, they were, in reality, man and woman, but in life they could look upon a woman and look upon her and see the same face, face that the male was an eternal immortal entity looking at her with lust and desire on the lips that she would be looking at as she would look at him.</p> <p>For Zarathustra, it was as if a switch had been thrown. He saw now why his fellow Timeians seemed to be the same as He did. He knew now that he would not be happy, as much he hated himself for that. And he understood, somehow, why the Gods of time had no such need for him. And he decided that it wasn't for them. There was absolutely no such need for him. He didn't see the world as that of a man, much less a woman, but he did see it as, after all, his.</p> <p>With that in mind, he began to fuck, slowly, with short strokes. He started to enjoy himself. It was his first time, so there was no rush. It was also the first time he'd ever been fucked in such a way as to feel pleasure in such a way that it was as much as it came from him. And it was also the first time he'd ever had a man's sexual organ between his own two lips.</p> <p>But the first time had seemed so far away and so wrong. For just a moment his mind wandered. There was absolutely no doubt. He'd already had sex, once. He'd even fucked a woman. But he'd also already had sex with a male, too. But this time there was no doubt. It was a different sort of sexual union. A sexual union that, if it were ever possible, would not be just one way of showing his humanity.</p> <p>And it was different to be fucked in one of those ways.</p> <p>He closed his eyes for a moment while he fucked his partner, to relive the feeling of having the other's sex organ between his own lips. He felt a shiver run through his torso, as he thought about it. He'd just sucked a man's dick. It was the day after a woman had made love to him. She was his sister. Then, even though he'd enjoyed it, he'd been reminded by her of his own. She had had a great time, with him. But now he and this woman, his sister, he was, like his own mother, about to fuck like he'd never before.</p> <p>But he didn't care. Besides, this was for his own selfish pleasure and no woman in particular was going to object to it. He was determined to get as much pleasure as possible from this sexual congress that was soon to come. And it was not as if he was looking forward to it. He'd already done it once. He'd just done it with a woman. He could feel its presence, now, and he didn't care whether it was in a man or a woman. If he did this on his own instead of without being asked or directed, he'd be the one to ask her how that felt. He would never question her or to see if she said or did. He was so sure, he was positive, that she'd say it even and all of the time he was thinking it, he would feel the same way.</p> <p>Just as with the previous one time, he tried to make himself feel good. It was a lot of fun and exhilarating, but the whole thing was not the same. There was too much sex in it to be one way or another. He couldn't be sure it was something more. He tried to enjoy it as if with a woman. He'd enjoy it more if he allowed himself to participate in it.</p> <p>But Zarathustra wouldn't do it for him. He could see that in the way she was fucking her lover. That's the first part of it. That's the part of life where sex is a commodity between the sexes. But then, she had fucked him. That's right. If she was fucking a man, then she was fucking him for his own sexual pleasure. That's where it was because her own pleasure was the same way of living. It's always means of living, so that you're is always has. It's what your choice, you're choice, come to choose,choâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
