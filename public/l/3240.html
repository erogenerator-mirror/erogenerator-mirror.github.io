English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XL. GREAT EVENTS.</h4><p><strong>There is an isle in the sea—not far from the Happy Isles of Zarathustra—on which a volcano ever smoketh; of which isle the people, and especially the old women amongst</strong> the people, and also the old men who are there, or, in the case of those who have been there, who are there, and are there. These are many of those times we are here together, though. It is the time in which we are apart, and also when the age of love is not upon us.</p> <p>I have been here many times, though.</p> <p>When I was sixteen, I was walking along the sea one day. My mother caught me and dragged me away to sea. I was a little worried, and my mother took me by the hand and led me to the sea, saying she thought I was the best thing ever to make love to. I cried with misery, and even after I felt that love could not possibly be as strong as there is now, I did not take back my mother's words.</p> <p>I must have looked down because I saw a dark, green dragon, which was flying around my mom as we approached the sea gate. That momentary happiness came rushing back, and I suddenly knew love could never be better than in the world.</p> <p>Then this dragon moved along my mother's neck and was coming for us from the sea with us. The water was cold, but my mother and I, also of the sea, were naked and kissing each other in the sea. There were the occasional noises of flies and flies around us, but all the dragon was coming toward us and moving to our backs. I was afraid and nervous at this moment, but the moment I was afraid, I was on my feet and kissing my mother. The dragon entered our world very slowly and very deliberately, exploring our bodies before entering into a world of pure, wonderful sex and loving.</p> <p>My mother made loud noises of pleasure as I kissed her. I couldn't help feeling myself and my mother, in that moment, both lovers, as well as lovers in love of each other. We are made for each other. That is how beautiful and erotic it is, and how wonderful.</p> <p>When my mother was moaning, the dragon did not move away. It continued its approach until I was sitting on my knees on the ground and kissing my mother's breasts. She was lying on the grass in her grass. I licked and suck on the nipples of my mother, caressing her breasts with my hands, and feeling the nipples of her own nipples, which I felt were sensitive from the caress of my mom's breasts, and that is not one of the things that most love—my mother's nipples and her breasts and nipples—are not for me.</p> <p>I did not pay much attention and not much attention to my mother's breasts. In fact, I was so focused that I had never seen something so beautiful and delightful as being sucked—or sucked and held—on my mother's breasts, when it is for me. I could never have imagined anything that beautiful in my mother's breasts.</p> <p>Mom's nipples were stiff. I had never seen her nipples harder before. I didn't know what to like about them. How to describe them? They were the same little round shapes that are the puckered flesh of my mother's buttock, and which I have seen many times.</p> <p>Mom's breasts were not particularly beautiful. Mother's were not very beautiful. I was looking for the difference, for both reasons. But there was no difference between mother's breasts and breasts of course. I could always describe them as a "tweleas" or a "garter", but my mother's nipples were hard and pointing, but not pointed up, and I could not compare them to my mother's in a conventional sense. There was no difference in the nipples of my mother—mother's nipples were hard and pointed—and there was no difference between mother's nipples—mom's nipples were pointed to—and there was a difference in the lips of my mother's mouth.</p> <p>Now, I could see everything, and smell everything that comes from it.</p> <p>My mother was sucking my penis while I knelt beside her, caressing and playing with her breasts. It was not love, but it was loving love. Mother was kissing my face and neck while I touched and fondled her breasts and sucked her nipples. I could not ever explain what love makes such love between lovers. It's just some physical connection between lovers. Of course, love isn't physical love.</p> <p>I had the right to my mother's love from the outside; but the love was not real love—though it was a physical longing of my mother as I had been for many of her lovers. I had never felt the feel of a woman's love. It was a very emotional loving love, though. Love doesn't always needs some one has to know it is loved by an action, and love can't love in the real love between a lover. Sometimes it is very emotional love. It needs be love is good that what we are very special: the same thing in love—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
