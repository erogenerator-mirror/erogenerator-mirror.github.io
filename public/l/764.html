It will be a strange moment."</p> <p>"We both need to get out of here," said Mrs. Edwards. "Let's just go."</p> <p>"Mrs. Edwards, we may have gone too far," said Archie.</p> <p>"Well, we've got to take a chance."</p> <p>"Oh, I think we need to try another option" said Archie.</p> <p>"I agree."</p> <p>And so Archie lay on his back, legs splayed, and Mrs. Edwards climbed on top. Her hair flew around her face. She kissed him gently on his mouth and then on his neck. They were both breathing hard. Then they kissed once again, long and slow.</p> <p>A little while later, after they had kissed for at least two minutes, Mrs. Edwards began to lick Archie's cock and balls through his trousers. She licked and nibbled his nuts. He felt her tongue sliding over the head of his penis and feeling that it was indeed there. She had put on a condom earlier in the evening and was sucking on his cock. Then she pulled her mouth from him and put the tip of his penis against her vagina. She spread her pussy lips with her fingers and inserted him inside of her. "Now you can fuck me good, Archie," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, God, I can't believe I'm doing this," he said. "I think we should try something, too."</p> <p>Mrs. Edwards rolled over onto her back underneath him.</p> <p>"Fuck me, Archie."</p> <p>"I've wanted to do this for a long time – ever since first seeing Mrs. Jones in the club."</p> <p>"Matter of fact, Archie, your mother told me a little something about us and how she's always kept you from getting into any one of her things," she said. "Now that I know, I'm quite sure that your mother won't have any idea if you've got a real hard-on."</p> <p>"Well, at least she'll still tell me that we shouldn't."</p> <p>She grinned. "There will be times for sure, Archie. Now put your hard-on inside of me and enjoy it, so that I can really do what any woman could do."</p> <p>She moved, lifting her hips off the bed and taking him as deep as it would go. Then, suddenly, she was lying underneath him, her long legs resting comfortably around him. Her right hand was holding firmly on and stroking his cock inside of her pussy that was squeezing it, and he could feel it filling her up and pressing against her cervix. He moved inside of her, filling her until she was screaming in orgasm, then fucking her.</p> <p>They fucked each other like that for what seemed like forever. Then, feeling he was ready to orgasm again, Mrs. Edwards turned off his cock.</p> <p>"It's late. We've got to get going and get breakfast, don't you think?"</p> <p>"Yes," said Archie.</p> <p>"Come on then. Let's go. Get yourself organised in the bathroom. Let us get out of here and freshen up. We are going to do a bit of shopping. I've got enough to go. We have to get in on the main course, don't we?"</p> <p>"Yes, we do," said Archie.</p> <p>They got out of the parlour and headed upstairs hand in hand.</p> <p>They had an uneasy discussion about the rest of the night, as they headed for the bathroom with Archie still inside Mrs. Edwards. They got themselves into bed together, and fell asleep happily.</p> <p>A few hours later, as they lay in a corner of the bed after a good night's sleep, Mrs. Edwards asked Archie, "What about me?"</p> <p>"Oh, Mrs. Edwards, what about you?"</p> <p>"Well," she said, "If you've got an inkling what you need to do, we'll call you a cab. We only have so much luggage, so we'll get you home somewhere as soon as we can. But then we can decide how to get you home. That way, you will stay at home, don't you agree? We shall call our taxi company, and have them pick you up. Or we can send someone else. Do you agree to that, Archie?"</p> <p>"Yes, Mrs Edwards."</p> <p>"Very good. I like the sound of that. Now get into bed and I'll put the coffee on and make you breakfast while you stay on. Do you agree?"</p> <p>"Yes, Mrs Edwards. We'll just go together."</p> <p></p> <p>"Let's just get in, er," said Archie.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Just out,</p> <p>Byes are in, "Oh's out,"</p> <p></p> <p>out,</p> <p>"on "Come"</p> <p>"out—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
