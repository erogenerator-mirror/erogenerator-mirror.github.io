I'd given up trying to be a schoolgirl and had accepted instead opting for a year of study for the first time in my life. In the end, it all boiled down to simple pleasure and fun and I had that yearning for it for another three months of hard work and lots of exercise.</p> <p>I was going home to my family once my parents were in the front yard, going to some friends' houses, going to my home and generally settling in with my life in a pleasant, even rapprozy, routine. That was when I first felt a small, intense, overwhelming, familiar feeling stir in my lower body. It was not entirely the physical. It was more as if my body was going to be part of it. My body, from the first moment I realized the physical part of me would be involved. That feeling, an insistent throb, grew as I slowly began to slide down into a small, barely there, but extremely exciting space where that part of me resided. As my body gradually began to relax it became more and more, and the rest of me began to expand. I couldn't get over how comfortable I was in the place. How safe. How natural. How safe. Was it possible to feel that way at home?</p> <p>The rest of me grew and became more and more excited. I couldn't help myself. I'd spent every night in the nude since I was a tiny teenager and could barely believe that my body was actually changing in ways I was never able to imagine. That sensation of being a naked creature had been completely and utterly new. My body had been completely, utterly, completely undressed and my body was as completely nude as my father's penis was. It hadn't taken long for me to figure it out, and if it hadn't been for it's natural and unspoken desires to be naked, I probably would have run naked home. It wasn't easy to justify it in those terms; but it became easy with the realization that I could feel my naked body against someone else's and it just felt so incredibly good. If it weren't for the fact that the feelings I was currently having from my mind were all my own I probably would have done it myself... except I wasn't ready to. Being a girl wasn't like being a girl.</p> <p>I slowly slid down into the narrow, taut, tight space that my brain and body were trying to keep as still as possible. The feeling of being there filled me with excitement. Of being bare to the waist in the nude. The feeling of being naked in front of a completely naked person. The very thought of being fully naked and the very feeling of being completely naked had me a little flustered. If only my heart hadn't been in my throat when I looked at myself in the living room mirror the first time I'd looked at myself.</p> <p>I was lying on a warm towel, my body lying flat on my back, my head supported on a pillow, my neck and shoulders stretched out toward the corner away from the mirror. It was the perfect height for me to put my head back and lie fully stretched out with my breasts, one exposed and the other equally bare, against the towel on the floor just below my head. My eyes were open and looking straight at the mirror as one hand was gently touching one of my breasts and as the other hand was casually working on my other breast, my nipple started to come into my mind and I could feel that I was doing it in a sexual way, in a sexy way, in an innocent and erotic way. My eyes moved from the mirror to one of the most intense sexual feelings in my mind. I was seeing myself in the mirror as a completely naked, female creature and not quite knowing of it at all. My fingers were touching the very essence of myself in the way that my nipples were touching one another. My body was lying down and my head was turned slightly to one side as my hands gently lifted my breasts up to expose my nipples to my own fingers. I watched myself through the mirror as gently, deliberately and thoroughly as I could as I slowly caressed myself and played with my nipples while my eyes watched myself and my body. It was amazing. I was seeing myself as an entirely naked woman. My naked body. My naked breasts. My naked naked pussy. My naked sex. My naked flesh. My naked cock. Naked sex. My naked mouth. Naked legs. Naked hand. Naked skin. Naked legs. Naked sex. Naked hair. Naked skin. Naked genitals. Naked pussy. Naked butt. Naked mouth. Naked feet. Naked breasts. Naked hands. Naked flesh. Naked sex. Naked legs Naked hand and naked breasts. I was naked body Naked love.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I wanted to give in an orgasm</p> <p></p> <p>to climax in my</p> <p></p> <p>to have to to be—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
