Either all things by the providence of reason happen unto every</h4><p><strong>particular, as a part of one general body; and then it is against reason that a part should complain of anything that happens for the good of the whole; or</strong> for the evil of mankind should want to fuck that whole thing. It must be true.</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>**</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Let's go for a while," said my husband, and we were off to the pub to see to some of the refreshments. As I got back into the car, he said, "Honey, don't you want a drink from the bar?"</p> <p>"What, we were drinking?"</p> <p>"No, I meant to go for a drink. I can't get into a pub."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Just make it go somewhere."</p> <p>I didn't think we would go off to the pub. Not that we would have all of our faculties in one place; but just that we could be in a bar. I guess we got the upper hand, and I was a little scared. So I told him about my fear of the pub, and he suggested we go up to the cellar and look at the wine. We took the steps up the stairs to the cellar and looked around. I guessed that they must have a cellar, but it looked empty.</p> <p>"That's it for me!" I said. "And that means we are going upstairs to our bedroom."</p> <p>"I can't get into my bedroom!"</p> <p>"You can. You are going to let me get in there!"</p> <p>"But only if we go to my bedroom?"</p> <p>"Yes, we are going to my bedroom, but you will have to get in there first."</p> <p>We went into my bedroom, and there was no door. We put our coats on the bed and entered my bedroom.</p> <p>"It's all yours. I have made up my mind to let you fuck me."</p> <p>"All yours," I said. "Only after you have made up your mind."</p> <p>"What has got into me?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I smiled, "but I have no idea. You are absolutely the most sexy man I have ever met; and you are fucking perfect. I have never known anyone that I loved as much as you do. Now go and have a glass of wine, and get your first taste of your new found woman. I'm sure that once you enjoy your evening of debauchery, you will be back for more."</p> <p>With that he started unbuttoning my blouse, and taking it off me, while I stood there watching him doing it.</p> <p>"Get on the bed," he said, "on your back."</p> <p>I lay on my back, and he got out of the rest of his clothes. I looked up at him, and he smiled, and then he was naked on his back.</p> <p>"Get to work, my dear," he said. "Get on your face."</p> <p>I kissed and sucked his cock and balls, which were growing in their sac, and he groaned in pleasure. He raised his hips up, and I sat up to get on my knees and licked his balls and cock. Then I sucked his cock all the way into my waiting throat. He put his hand round my head and started to push it in and out, and I was getting his cock even harder as I got it sucked on it.</p> <p>I sucked him harder and harder, while he rubbed my clit, which was now making me cum. But he wouldn't give me my first chance this evening to enjoy, and then he was going to fuck me. But first, he gave me some instructions to follow, and I told him about going to the bathroom for a little, but only to take his condoms with me, which would have been easier.</p> <p>When he came back, he said, "Lay on the bed so you can lick my cock for a while. And then you can have a drink of the wine. It was hard for you to refuse."</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>It is true that we were still in bed when I opened the bedroom door.</p> <p>Now I was very afraid that I had gone too far, but that it had been enough to get us started, and I enjoyed his teasing of me by watching him put his condom on his cock, and sliding it around inside me. If his cock hadn't been so hard, I had wondered how big it would be. To be fair, the last time was just about the biggest, and I had been surprised how big it made it. Just thinking of fucking him made my cunt gush hot all over all of it; like it had only been a week since I had had my fingers inside it.</p> <p>Then he was down with a condom on as he fucked me, and started to go slowly at an hour on. I had not. But all of the second he went in and third. In third and forth, and fourth hour up and up and down.</p> <p>And down.
